https://openalex.org/W2119079421,"Subunits of mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF or BAF) complexes have recently been implicated as tumor suppressors in human malignancies. To understand the full extent of their involvement, we conducted a proteomic analysis of endogenous mSWI/SNF complexes, which identified several new dedicated, stable subunits not found in yeast SWI/SNF complexes, including BCL7A, BCL7B and BCL7C, BCL11A and BCL11B, BRD9 and SS18. Incorporating these new members, we determined mSWI/SNF subunit mutation frequency in exome and whole-genome sequencing studies of primary human tumors. Notably, mSWI/SNF subunits are mutated in 19.6% of all human tumors reported in 44 studies. Our analysis suggests that specific subunits protect against cancer in specific tissues. In addition, mutations affecting more than one subunit, defined here as compound heterozygosity, are prevalent in certain cancers. Our studies demonstrate that mSWI/SNF is the most frequently mutated chromatin-regulatory complex (CRC) in human cancer, exhibiting a broad mutation pattern, similar to that of TP53. Thus, proper functioning of polymorphic BAF complexes may constitute a major mechanism of tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2076948707,"Identifying tumor-associated T cell epitopes can be laborious. Robbins et al. now report that they used whole-exome sequence data to identify mutated peptides from tumor antigens that are recognized by tumor-infiltrating T cells from patients with melanoma who experienced therapy-associated tumor regressions. The method will contribute to the identification of new tumor-specific epitopes that may further the development of effective T cell therapies for the treatment of patients with melanoma as well as a variety of additional malignancies. Substantial regressions of metastatic lesions have been observed in up to 70% of patients with melanoma who received adoptively transferred autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in phase 2 clinical trials1,2. In addition, 40% of patients treated in a recent trial experienced complete regressions of all measurable lesions for at least 5 years following TIL treatment3. To evaluate the potential association between the ability of TILs to mediate durable regressions and their ability to recognize potent antigens that presumably include mutated gene products, we developed a new screening approach involving mining whole-exome sequence data to identify mutated proteins expressed in patient tumors. We then synthesized and evaluated candidate mutated T cell epitopes that were identified using a major histocompatibility complex–binding algorithm4 for recognition by TILs. Using this approach, we identified mutated antigens expressed on autologous tumor cells that were recognized by three bulk TIL lines from three individuals with melanoma that were associated with objective tumor regressions following adoptive transfer. This simplified approach for identifying mutated antigens recognized by T cells avoids the need to generate and laboriously screen cDNA libraries from tumors and may represent a generally applicable method for identifying mutated antigens expressed in a variety of tumor types."

https://openalex.org/W2130492588,"Whole-genome sequencing of 616 asymptomatically carried Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was used to study the impact of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Comparison of closely related isolates showed the role of transformation in facilitating capsule switching to non-vaccine serotypes and the emergence of drug resistance. However, such recombination was found to occur at significantly different rates across the species, and the evolution of the population was primarily driven by changes in the frequency of distinct genotypes extant before the introduction of the vaccine. These alterations resulted in little overall effect on accessory genome composition at the population level, contrasting with the decrease in pneumococcal disease rates after the vaccine's introduction."
https://openalex.org/W2153076514,"Increased stromal collagen deposition in human breast tumours correlates with metastases. We show that activation of the collagen I receptor DDR2 (discoidin domain receptor 2) regulates SNAIL1 stability by stimulating ERK2 activity, in a Src-dependent manner. Activated ERK2 directly phosphorylates SNAIL1, leading to SNAIL1 nuclear accumulation, reduced ubiquitylation and increased protein half-life. DDR2-mediated stabilization of SNAIL1 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro, and metastasis in vivo. DDR2 expression was observed in most human invasive ductal breast carcinomas studied, and was associated with nuclear SNAIL1 and absence of E-cadherin expression. We propose that DDR2 maintains SNAIL1 level and activity in tumour cells that have undergone epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby facilitating continued tumour cell invasion through collagen-I-rich extracellular matrices by sustaining the EMT phenotype. As such, DDR2 could be an RTK (receptor tyrosine kinase) target for the treatment of breast cancer metastasis. Longmore and colleagues show that in cancer cells that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), activation of the collagen I receptor DDR2 results in ERK2-dependent maintenance of the protein levels and activity of the EMT inducer SNAIL1, thus facilitating cancer cell invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2053358049,"In this study, the authors show that MGE-derived interneuron progenitors, when engrafted into the adult hippocampus, can migrate long distances and functionally integrate into the host tissue. In addition, if these cells are engrafted into the brain after the initiation of epilepsy, seizure frequency and behavioral deficits are reduced. Impaired GABA-mediated neurotransmission has been implicated in many neurologic diseases, including epilepsy, intellectual disability and psychiatric disorders. We found that inhibitory neuron transplantation into the hippocampus of adult mice with confirmed epilepsy at the time of grafting markedly reduced the occurrence of electrographic seizures and restored behavioral deficits in spatial learning, hyperactivity and the aggressive response to handling. In the recipient brain, GABA progenitors migrated up to 1,500 μm from the injection site, expressed genes and proteins characteristic for interneurons, differentiated into functional inhibitory neurons and received excitatory synaptic input. In contrast with hippocampus, cell grafts into basolateral amygdala rescued the hyperactivity deficit, but did not alter seizure activity or other abnormal behaviors. Our results highlight a critical role for interneurons in epilepsy and suggest that interneuron cell transplantation is a powerful approach to halting seizures and rescuing accompanying deficits in severely epileptic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1991950992,"Many chemotherapy drugs cause sensory nerve damage as well as long-lasting damage to hematopoietic regeneration in the bone marrow. Paul Frenette and his colleagues show that this hematopoietic damage is caused by injury to bone marrow sympathetic nerve fibers, disrupting the hematopoietic stem cell niche. These findings point to the potential of neuroprotective agents in preserving hematopoietic function in chemotherapy-treated patients with cancer. Anticancer chemotherapy drugs challenge hematopoietic tissues to regenerate but commonly produce long-term sequelae. Chemotherapy-induced deficits in hematopoietic stem or stromal cell function have been described, but the mechanisms mediating hematopoietic dysfunction remain unclear. Administration of multiple cycles of cisplatin chemotherapy causes substantial sensory neuropathy. Here we demonstrate that chemotherapy-induced nerve injury in the bone marrow of mice is a crucial lesion impairing hematopoietic regeneration. Using pharmacological and genetic models, we show that the selective loss of adrenergic innervation in the bone marrow alters its regeneration after genotoxic insult. Sympathetic nerves in the marrow promote the survival of constituents of the stem cell niche that initiate recovery. Neuroprotection by deletion of Trp53 in sympathetic neurons or neuroregeneration by administration of 4-methylcatechol or glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes hematopoietic recovery. These results demonstrate the potential benefit of adrenergic nerve protection for shielding hematopoietic niches from injury."
https://openalex.org/W2055055895,"The adult mouse subependymal zone (SEZ) harbours adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) that give rise to neuronal and oligodendroglial progeny. However it is not known whether the same aNSC can give rise to neuronal and oligodendroglial progeny or whether these distinct progenies constitute entirely separate lineages. Continuous live imaging and single-cell tracking of aNSCs and their progeny isolated from the mouse SEZ revealed that aNSCs exclusively generate oligodendroglia or neurons, but never both within a single lineage. Moreover, activation of canonical Wnt signalling selectively stimulated proliferation within the oligodendrogliogenic lineage, resulting in a massive increase in oligodendrogliogenesis without changing lineage choice or proliferation within neurogenic clones. In vivo activation or inhibition of canonical Wnt signalling respectively increased or decreased the number of Olig2 and PDGFR- α positive cells, suggesting that this pathway contributes to the fine tuning of oligodendrogliogenesis in the adult SEZ. Adult mouse subependymal neural stem cells (aNSCs) give rise to neuronal and oligodendroglial progeny. Berninger and colleagues use continuous live imaging and single-cell tracking to demonstrate that single aNSCs isolated from the mouse brain generate exclusively either oligodendrocytes or neurons. They also show that Wnt activation stimulates oligodendrogenic progenitor proliferation without affecting neurogenic clones."
https://openalex.org/W2024039167,"Bone mass declines with age but the mechanisms responsible remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that deletion of a conditional allele for Atg7, a gene essential for autophagy, from osteocytes caused low bone mass in 6-month-old male and female mice. Cancellous bone volume and cortical thickness were decreased, and cortical porosity increased, in conditional knock-out mice compared with control littermates. These changes were associated with low osteoclast number, osteoblast number, bone formation rate, and wall width in the cancellous bone of conditional knock-out mice. In addition, oxidative stress was higher in the bones of conditional knock-out mice as measured by reactive oxygen species levels in the bone marrow and by p66shc phosphorylation in L6 vertebra. Each of these changes has been previously demonstrated in the bones of old versus young adult mice. Thus, these results demonstrate that suppression of autophagy in osteocytes mimics, in many aspects, the impact of aging on the skeleton and suggest that a decline in autophagy with age may contribute to the low bone mass associated with aging.Background: The role of autophagy in osteocytes is unclear.Results: Suppression of autophagy in osteocytes caused decreases in bone mass and bone remodeling similar to those caused by aging.Conclusion: Autophagy in osteocytes maintains the rate of remodeling and bone mass.Significance: A decline in autophagy in osteocytes may contribute to skeletal aging.

Conclusion: Autophagy in osteocytes maintains the rate of remodeling and bone mass. Significance: A decline in autophagy in osteocytes may contribute to skeletal aging. Aging causes bone loss but the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood. The adult skeleton is continuously remodeled by teams of osteoclasts, which resorb bone, and teams of osteoblasts, which form new bone (1Manolagas S.C. Birth and death of bone cells: Basic regulatory mechanisms and implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of osteoporosis.Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). These teams function together within an anatomical structure known as the basic multicellular unit (BMU). 2The abbreviations used are: BMU, basic multicellular unit; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RANKL, receptor activator of NFκB ligand; BMD, bone mineral density; CFU, colony forming unit; PTH, parathyroid hormone; DEXA, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry; OPG, osteoprotegerin. Because bone mass declines with age, it is clear that the balance between resorption and formation within the BMU becomes negative with aging. Reduced production of sex steroids causes a rise in the rate of bone remodeling that subsides with time, but age-associated bone loss occurs even in individuals with normal levels of sex steroids (2Riggs B.L. Melton L.J. Robb R.A. Camp J.J. Atkinson E.J. McDaniel L. Amin S. Rouleau P.A. Khosla S.

Res. 2008; 23: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Importantly, rodents do not experience a significant decline in sex steroids with age but bone mass declines nonetheless, suggesting that mechanisms intrinsic to bone cells contribute to skeletal involution with age (3Almeida M. Han L. Martin-Millan M. Plotkin L.I. Stewart S.A. Roberson P.K. Kousteni S. O'Brien C.A. Bellido T. Parfitt A.M. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C.

Chem. 2007; 282: 27285-27297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, these intrinsic mechanisms remain unclear. Autophagy is an intracellular recycling pathway in which cellular components, including protein aggregates and organelles, are targeted to the lysosome for degradation (4Yang Z. Klionsky D.J. Eaten alive: a history of macroautophagy.Nat Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). There are multiple forms of autophagy, which are distinguished from one another by the mechanisms used to target cellular components to the lysosome (5Levine B. Kroemer G. Autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease.Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy, hereafter referred to simply as autophagy, accomplishes this by engulfing the components to be degraded in a double-membrane structure known as the autophagosome, which eventually fuses with lysosomes (6He C. Klionsky D.J. Regulation mechanisms and signaling pathways of autophagy.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 67-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (2744) Google Scholar). One of the major functions of autophagy is to transform cellular components into substrates for energy production when nutrients are limiting. A second important function is to recycle damaged or malfunctioning proteins and organelles. Indeed, suppression of autophagy leads to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria which produce elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (7Tal M.C. Sasai M. Lee H.K. Yordy B. Shadel G.S. Iwasaki A. Absence of autophagy results in reactive oxygen species-dependent amplification of RLR signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sci. 2011; 36: 30-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Because this recycling function is important for the health and viability of long-lived cell types, reduced efficiency of the autophagic process has been proposed as an underlying cause of cellular and organismal aging (10Vellai T. Takács-Vellai K. Sass M. Klionsky D.J.

How to live long and prosper: autophagy, mitochondria, and aging.Physiology. 2008; 23: 248-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, genetic suppression of autophagy in cell types such as neurons and myocytes mimics the effects of aging on tissues containing these cell types (13Komatsu M. Wang Q.J. Holstein G.R. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Iwata J. Kominami E. Chait B.T. Tanaka K. Yue Z.

Osteocytes are former osteoblasts that are buried within the bone matrix and remain connected to one another and cells on the bone surface via a network of cell projections (15Bonewald L.F. The amazing osteocyte.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2011; 26: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). In contrast to osteoclasts and osteoblasts, which reside on the bone surface and are short-lived cells, osteocytes may live many months or years, depending on the location within the skeleton and the rate of bone remodeling (16Manolagas S.C. Parfitt A.M. What old means to bone.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 21: 369-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Moreover, osteocytes are an important source of receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL), which controls osteoclast formation, and sclerostin, which controls osteoblast formation (17Xiong J. Onal M. Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Manolagas S.C. O'Brien C.A. Matrix-embedded cells control osteoclast formation.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar18Nakashima T.

Targeted deletion of the sclerostin gene in mice results in increased bone formation and bone strength.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2008; 23: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Thus changes in osteocyte function with age may alter remodeling and thereby contribute to the low bone mass associated with aging (16Manolagas S.C. Parfitt A.M. What old means to bone.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 21: 369-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Herein we present evidence that genetic suppression of autophagy in murine osteocytes causes skeletal changes in young adult mice that are similar to those present in old wild type mice. Thus a decline in osteocyte autophagy may contribute to the skeletal changes that occur during old age. The generation of dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1)-Cre transgenic mice and mice harboring an Atg7 conditional allele has been described previously (21Lu Y. Xie Y. Zhang S. Dusevich V. Bonewald L.F.

Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). The experimental animals used in most of the studies described here were obtained using a two-step breeding strategy. Hemizygous Dmp1-Cre transgenic mice were crossed with heterozygous Atg7-flox mice to generate heterozygous Atg7-flox offspring with and without a Dmp1-Cre allele. These offspring were then intercrossed to generate the following offspring: wild type (WT) mice, mice hemizygous for the Dmp1-Cre allele, mice homozygous for the Atg7-flox allele, hereafter referred to as Atg7-f/f, and Atg7-f/f mice that were also hemizygous for the Dmp1-Cre allele. For studies requiring larger numbers of mice, Atg7-f/f mice were crossed with Atg7-f/f mice that were also hemizygous for the Dmp1-Cre allele. Offspring were genotyped by PCR using the following primer sequences: Cre-for, 5′-GCGGTCTGGCAGTAAAAACTATC-3′, Cre-rev, 5′-GTGAAACAGCATTGCTGTCACTT-3′, product size 102 bp; Hind-Fw, 5′-TGGCTGCTACTTCTGCAATGATGT-3′, Atg7-ex14-F, 5′-TCTCCCAAGACAAGACAGGGTGAA-3′, Pst-Rv, 5′-CAGGACAGAGACCATCAGCTCCAC-3′, product size 216 bp (WT) and 500 bp (floxed allele). Both the Dmp1-Cre and Atg7-flox mice were crossed into the C57BL/6 genetic background for more than 10 generations prior to initiating generation of mice for this study. Bone mineral density (BMD), microcomputed tomography (μCT), histomorphometry, and strength-testing were performed as previously described (17Xiong J. Onal M. Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Manolagas S.C.

CTX and PNIP in blood plasma were measured using kits according to the manufacturer's directions (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Scottsdale, AZ). Intracellular ROS levels were quantified in freshly isolated bone marrow cells from femurs using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dye (25Huang X. Frenkel K. Klein C.B. Costa M.

All studies involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System. Osteocyte-enriched cortical bone was prepared as previously described (17Xiong J. Onal M. Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Manolagas S.C. O'Brien C.A. Matrix-embedded cells control osteoclast formation.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). For genomic DNA isolation, bone pieces were decalcified in 14% EDTA for 1 week after collagenase digestion. Decalcified osteocyte-enriched bone was then digested with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS) at 55 °C overnight. Genomic DNA was then isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. For soft tissues, ∼30 mg of tissue was digested with proteinase K and processed in the same way as osteocyte-enriched bone. RNA was purified from bone and soft tissues using Ultraspec reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX), according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA was purified from cultured cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). To quantify Atg7 gene deletion, the following custom Taqman assay for exon 14 was used: forward, 5′-ACCAGCAGTGCACAGTGA-3′, reverse, 5′-GCTGCAGGACAGAGACCAT-3′, probe, 5′-FAM-CTGGCCGTGATTGCAGNFQ-3′. All Taqman assays used in this study were obtained from Invitrogen (Foster City, CA). The custom Atg7 assay was used in combination with a Taqman copy number reference assay, Tfrc (catalogue number 4458367), and the relative amount of Atg7 exon 14 genomic DNA was calculated using the ΔCt method (26Livak K.J.

Protein was extracted from osteocyte-enriched cortical bone by freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by pulverization in liquid nitrogen. The pulverized bone powder was then incubated in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Igepal CA-630 (Nonidet P-40), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) containing 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 6% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptolethanol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue) for 10 min at 100 °C. Proteins were then resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were subsequently blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS and were then incubated with primary antibodies and an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. The following antibodies were used: anti-LC3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-p62 (Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, Germany), and anti-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence and the intensity of the bands was quantified using a ChemDoc XRS-plus system (Bio-Rad). Protein extraction from L6 vertebra and quantification of p66shc by immunoblotting was performed as previously described (3Almeida M. Han L. Martin-Millan M. Plotkin L.I. Stewart S.A. Roberson P.K.

Osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow precursors was evaluated by plating bone marrow cells in 12-well plates at 5 × 106 cells/well and culturing in α-MEM containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, 1% ascorbic acid, and 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate. One-half of the culture medium was changed every 3 days. After 21 days, the cultures were fixed with 10% Millonig's modified phosphate buffered formalin and then stained with an aqueous solution of 40 mm alizarin red. After photography, the alizarin red was extracted with 10% acetic acid and quantified as previously described (28Gregory C.A. Gunn W.G. Peister A. Prockop D.J. An Alizarin red-based assay of mineralization by adherent cells in culture: comparison with cetylpyridinium chloride extraction.Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Osteoblast-specific gene expression was evaluated in parallel cultures lacking β-glycerolphosphate and harvested after 12 days. Osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow progenitors was evaluated by culturing bone marrow cells in the presence of M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and RANKL (30 ng/ml) for 5 days followed by TRAP staining as previously described (29Martin-Millan M.

The estrogen receptor-α in osteoclasts mediates the protective effects of estrogens on cancellous but not cortical bone.Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The ability of bone marrow cells to support osteoclast differentiation was evaluated by plating bone marrow cells as above and adding vehicle or 10−7 m parathyroid hormone (PTH) for 12 days followed by RNA extraction and quantification of osteoclast-specific genes. Femurs from 6-month-old female mice were fixed in 10% Millonigs modified phosphate-buffered formalin for 24 h, decalcified in 5% formic acid and dehydrated in 100% ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, prior to paraffin-embedding and sectioning. Apoptotic osteocytes were detected using TACS® 2 TdT DAB (diaminobenzidine) Kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Decalcified bones were placed into fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2.0% paraformaldehyde, 0.025% calcium chloride in a 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) and allowed to fix for 3 h at room temperature. The bones were post fixed with osmium tetroxide, en bloc stained with 2.0% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in pure epoxy resin. Thin sections were cut using a diamond knife and an LKB 2088 ultramicrotome and placed on copper grids. Sections were stained with lead citrate and examined in a FEI Morgagni transmission electron microscope. Images were captured with an AMT 2K digital CCD camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers MA). Data were analyzed using SigmaStat (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). All data that passed Levene's test for constant variance and the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, either as the data were, or after log or reciprocal transformation, were evaluated for differences between group means using two-way ANOVA or Student's t test. For comparisons using ANOVA, post-hoc analysis was performed using the Holm-Sidak method. Data that did not pass the normality test were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test. All values are reported as the mean ± S.D. To directly address the role of autophagy in osteocytes, we utilized mice harboring a conditional allele for Atg7, which is an E1-like enzyme that activates a ubiquitin-like protein known as LC3 (6He C. Klionsky D.J. Regulation mechanisms and signaling pathways of autophagy.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 67-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (2744) Google Scholar). LC3 becomes conjugated to phosphatidyl ethanolamine and is required for autophagosome production (6He C. Klionsky D.J. Regulation mechanisms and signaling pathways of autophagy.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 67-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (2744) Google Scholar). Importantly, Atg7 is essential for autophagy (22Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. Impairment of starvation-induced and constitutive autophagy in Atg7-deficient mice.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). Atg7-flox mice were crossed with transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of Dmp1 regulatory elements, hereafter designated Dmp1-Cre mice (21Lu Y. Xie Y. Zhang S. Dusevich V. Bonewald L.F. Feng J.Q. DMP1-targeted Cre expression in odontoblasts and osteocytes.J. Dent. Res. 2007; 86: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The Dmp1-Cre transgene results in recombination in osteocytes and some mature osteoblasts (17Xiong J. Onal M. Jilka R.L. Weinstein R.S. Manolagas S.C. O'Brien C.A.

DMP1-targeted Cre expression in odontoblasts and osteocytes.J. Dent. Res. 2007; 86: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Mice lacking Atg7 in all tissues die within 1 day after birth (22Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. Impairment of starvation-induced and constitutive autophagy in Atg7-deficient mice.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar), but Dmp1-Cre;Atg7-f/f mice were obtained at the expected Mendelian frequency when analyzed at 21 days of age. Analysis of genomic DNA extracted from osteocyte-enriched cortical bone revealed a 75% reduction of the Atg7 conditional allele that did not occur in soft tissues (Fig. 1A). Direct analysis of LC3 expression in protein extracted from bone shafts demonstrated reduced conversion from form I (unlipidated) to form II (lipidated) in the conditional knock-out mice (Fig. 1B) as well as accumulation of p62/sqstm1, a protein frequently elevated in cells with reduced autophagy (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results confirm that autophagy was effectively suppressed in osteocytes by deletion of Atg7 using the Dmp1-Cre transgene. BMD measurement in 6-week-old mice by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) revealed a small decrease in femoral BMD in male conditional knock-out mice, but no change in spinal or total BMD (supplemental Fig. S1). No change in BMD at any site was detected in female mice at this age, and body weight was not different from controls in either sex (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, at 6 months of age conditional knock-out mice had low bone mass at all skeletal sites compared with control littermates (Fig. 2A). The low bone mass at this age occurred in conditional knock-out mice of both sexes and was associated with normal body weight (supplemental Fig. S1). Littermates homozygous for the Atg7-conditional allele (Atg7-f/f) or harboring only the Dmp1-Cre transgene had bone mass indistinguishable from wild-type littermates demonstrating the specificity of the bone mass phenotype (Fig. 2A). Based on the latter observation, all further analysis was confined to Atg7-f/f and Dmp1-Cre;Atg7-f/f littermates. Analysis of the skeleton by μCT revealed decreased cancellous bone volume in the spine and femur (Fig. 2, B–D). In addition, cortical thickness was reduced and cortical porosity was increased in the femurs of conditional knock-out mice (Fig. 2, E and F). Consistent with these changes in bone mass, biomechanical testing revealed that compression strength was reduced in lumbar vertebrae of the conditional knock-out mice (Fig. 2G). To determine whether changes in bone remodeling might explain the low bone mass of the mice lacking autophagy in osteocytes, we performed histomorphometric analysis of lumbar vertebrae. Osteoclast number and the extent of bone surface covered by osteoclasts were decreased by ∼50% in the conditional knock-out mice (Fig. 3, A and B), as were osteoblast number and surface (Fig. 3, C and D). In line with reduced osteoblast number, the bone formation rate was reduced in the conditional knock-out mice due to a reduced amount of mineralizing surface but no change in the mineral apposition rate (Fig. 3, E–H). Reduced wall width is a consistent histological finding in aged human and murine bone and reflects the reduced amount of work (new bone matrix) performed by teams of osteoblasts (3Almeida M. Han L.

https://openalex.org/W2013139068,"Oligodendrocytes—the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system—can be regenerated during adulthood. In adults, new oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but also from neural stem cells (NSCs). Although several factors supporting oligodendrocyte production have been characterized, the mechanisms underlying the generation of adult oligodendrocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that genetic inactivation of SIRT1, a protein deacetylase implicated in energy metabolism, increases the production of new OPCs in the adult mouse brain, in part by acting in NSCs. New OPCs produced following SIRT1 inactivation differentiate normally, generating fully myelinating oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, SIRT1 inactivation ameliorates remyelination and delays paralysis in mouse models of demyelinating injuries. SIRT1 inactivation leads to the upregulation of genes involved in cell metabolism and growth factor signalling, in particular PDGF receptor α (PDGFRα). Oligodendrocyte expansion following SIRT1 inactivation is mediated at least in part by AKT and p38 MAPK—signalling molecules downstream of PDGFRα. The identification of drug-targetable enzymes that regulate oligodendrocyte regeneration in adults could facilitate the development of therapies for demyelinating injuries and diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Oligodendrocytes produce myelin in the central nervous system and can regenerate in adults. Brunet and colleagues show that inactivation of SIRT1 deacetylase increases the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitors partly by shifting other neural stem cells to this fate. Using genome-wide approaches, they delineate PDGFRα as a critical target of SIRT1 in its negative effects on oligodendrocyte lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2062754839,"Adult stem cells undergo asymmetric cell division to self-renew and give rise to differentiated cells that comprise mature tissue. Sister chromatids may be distinguished and segregated nonrandomly in asymmetrically dividing stem cells, although the underlying mechanism and the purpose it may serve remain elusive. Here we develop the CO-FISH (chromosome orientation fluorescence in situ hybridization) technique with single-chromosome resolution and show that sister chromatids of X and Y chromosomes, but not autosomes, are segregated nonrandomly during asymmetric divisions of Drosophila male germline stem cells. This provides the first direct evidence, to our knowledge, that two sister chromatids containing identical genetic information can be distinguished and segregated nonrandomly during asymmetric stem-cell divisions. We further show that the centrosome, SUN-KASH nuclear envelope proteins and Dnmt2 (also known as Mt2) are required for nonrandom sister chromatid segregation. Our data indicate that the information on X and Y chromosomes that enables nonrandom segregation is primed during gametogenesis in the parents. Moreover, we show that sister chromatid segregation is randomized in germline stem cell overproliferation and dedifferentiated germline stem cells. We propose that nonrandom sister chromatid segregation may serve to transmit distinct information carried on two sister chromatids to the daughters of asymmetrically dividing stem cells."

https://openalex.org/W2056535309,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced responses are associated with the loss of insulin-producing β-cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus. β-Cell survival during ER stress is believed to depend on decreased protein synthesis rates that are mediated via phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α. It is reported here that chronic ER stress correlated with increased islet protein synthesis and apoptosis in β-cells in vivo. Paradoxically, chronic ER stress in β-cells induced an anabolic transcription program to overcome translational repression by eIF2α phosphorylation. This program included expression of amino acid transporter and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes downstream of the stress-induced ATF4-mediated transcription program. The anabolic response was associated with increased amino acid flux and charging of tRNAs for branched chain and aromatic amino acids (e.g. leucine and tryptophan), the levels of which are early serum indicators of diabetes. We conclude that regulation of amino acid transport in β-cells during ER stress involves responses leading to increased protein synthesis, which can be protective during acute stress but can lead to apoptosis during chronic stress. These studies suggest that the increased expression of amino acid transporters in islets can serve as early diagnostic biomarkers for the development of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1970030280,"The interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment are crucial for malignant progression, as they modulate invasion-related activities. Tumor-associated macrophages are generally considered allies in the process of tumor progression in several types of cancer, although their role on gastric and colorectal carcinomas is still poorly understood. In this report, we studied the influence of primary human macrophages on gastric and colorectal cancer cells, considering invasion, motility/migration, proteolysis and activated intracellular signaling pathways. We demonstrated that macrophages stimulate cancer cell invasion, motility and migration, and that these effects depend on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and on the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (at the residue Y1086), PLC-γ (phospholipase C-gamma) and Gab1 (GRB2-associated binding protein-1), as evidenced by siRNA (small interference RNA) experiments. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-immunodepletion impaired macrophage-mediated cancer cell invasion and motility, suggesting that EGF is the pro-invasive and pro-motile factor produced by macrophages. Macrophages also induced gastric and colorectal cancer cell phosphorylation of Akt, c-Src and ERK1/2, and led to an increase of RhoA and Cdc42 activity. Interestingly, whereas macrophage-mediated cancer cell c-Src and ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurred downstream EGFR activation, Akt phosphorylation seems to be a parallel event, taking place in an EGFR-independent manner. The involvement of EGF, EGFR-downstream signaling partners and MMPs in macrophage-mediated invasion provides novel insights into the molecular crosstalk established between cancer cells and macrophages, opening new perspectives for the design of new and more efficient therapeutic strategies to counteract cancer cell invasion."

https://openalex.org/W2086857229,"The transition zone is a specialized compartment found at the base of cilia, adjacent to the centriole distal end, where axonemal microtubules are heavily crosslinked to the surrounding membrane to form a barrier that gates the ciliary compartment. A number of ciliopathy molecules have been found to associate with the transition zone, but factors that directly recognize axonemal microtubules to specify transition zone assembly at the cilia base remain unclear. Here, through quantitative centrosome proteomics, we identify an axoneme-associated protein, CEP162 (KIAA1009), tethered specifically at centriole distal ends to promote transition zone assembly. CEP162 interacts with core transition zone components, and mediates their association with microtubules. Loss of CEP162 arrests ciliogenesis at the stage of transition zone assembly. Abolishing its centriolar tethering, however, allows CEP162 to stay on the growing end of the axoneme and ectopically assemble transition zone components at cilia tips. This generates extra-long cilia with strikingly swollen tips that actively release ciliary contents into the extracellular environment. CEP162 is thus an axoneme-recognition protein pre-tethered at centriole distal ends before ciliogenesis to promote and restrict transition zone formation specifically at the cilia base."

Despite their epidemiological, clinical and health economic importance, prevalence data on pain and musculoskeletal complaints for Germany are scarce.A cross-sectional survey of a random sample of citizens of Herne, Germany, aged ≥ 40 years was performed. A detailed self-complete postal questionnaire was used, followed by a short reminder questionnaire and telephone contacts for those not responding. The questionnaire contained 66 items, mainly addressing pain of any site, musculoskeletal complaints of any site and of knee and hip, pain intensities, the Western Ontario MacMaster Universities (WOMAC) index, medication, health care utilization, comorbidities, and quality of life.The response rate was 57.8% (4,527 of 7,828 individuals). Survey participants were on average 1.3 years older, and the proportion of women among responders tended to be greater than in the population sample. There was no age difference between the population sample and 2,221 participants filling out the detailed questionnaire. The following standardized prevalences were assessed: current pain: 59.7%, pain within the past four weeks: 74.5%, current joint complaints: 49.3%, joint complaints within the past four weeks and twelve month: 62.8% and 67.4%, respectively, knee as the site predominantly affected: 30.9%, knee bilateral: 9.7%, hip: 15.2%, hip bilateral: 3.5%, knee and hip: 5.5%. Pain and musculoskeletal complaints were significantly more often reported by women. A typical relationship of pain and joint complaints to age could be found, i.e. increasing prevalences with increasing age categories, with a drop in the highest age groups. In general, pain and joint pain were associated with comorbidity and body mass index as well as quality of life.Our data confirm findings of other recent national as well as European surveys. The high site specific prevalences of knee and hip complaints underline the necessity to further investigate characteristics and consequences of pain and symptomatic osteoarthritis of these joints in adults in Germany."
https://openalex.org/W2126728341,"Gain-of-function mutations in the canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) gene are a cause of autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The mechanisms whereby abnormal TRPC6 activity results in proteinuria remain unknown. The ERK1/2 MAPKs are activated in glomeruli and podocytes in several proteinuric disease models. We therefore examined whether FSGS-associated mutations in TRPC6 result in activation of these kinases. In 293T cells and cultured podocytes, overexpression of gain-of-function TRPC6 mutants resulted in increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, an effect dependent upon channel function. Pharmacologic inhibitor studies implicated several signaling mediators, including calmodulin and calcineurin, supporting the importance of TRPC6-mediated calcium influx in this process. Through medium transfer experiments, we uncovered two distinct mechanisms for ERK activation by mutant TRPC6, a cell-autonomous, EGF receptor-independent mechanism and a non-cell-autonomous mechanism involving metalloprotease-mediated release of a presumed EGF receptor ligand. The inhibitors KN-92 and H89 were able to block both pathways in mutant TRPC6 expressing cells as well as the prolonged elevation of intracellular calcium levels upon carbachol stimulation seen in these cells. However, these effects appear to be independent of their effects on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and PKA, respectively. Phosphorylation of Thr-70, Ser-282, and Tyr-31/285 were not necessary for ERK activation by mutant TRPC6, although a phosphomimetic TRPC6 S282E mutant was capable of ERK activation. Taken together, these results identify two pathways downstream of mutant TRPC6 leading to ERK activation that may play a role in the development of FSGS."
https://openalex.org/W2037780763,"Mature rod photoreceptor cells contain very small nuclei with tightly condensed heterochromatin. We observed that during mouse rod maturation, the nucleosomal repeat length increases from 190 bp at postnatal day 1 to 206 bp in the adult retina. At the same time, the total level of linker histone H1 increased reaching the ratio of 1.3 molecules of total H1 per nucleosome, mostly via a dramatic increase in H1c. Genetic elimination of the histone H1c gene is functionally compensated by other histone variants. However, retinas in H1c/H1e/H1(0) triple knock-outs have photoreceptors with bigger nuclei, decreased heterochromatin area, and notable morphological changes suggesting that the process of chromatin condensation and rod cell structural integrity are partly impaired. In triple knock-outs, nuclear chromatin exposed several epigenetic histone modification marks masked in the wild type chromatin. Dramatic changes in exposure of a repressive chromatin mark, H3K9me2, indicate that during development linker histone plays a role in establishing the facultative heterochromatin territory and architecture in the nucleus. During retina development, the H1c gene and its promoter acquired epigenetic patterns typical of rod-specific genes. Our data suggest that histone H1c gene expression is developmentally up-regulated to promote facultative heterochromatin in mature rod photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1987330468,"On 9 June 2008, the UK's largest mass stranding event (MSE) of short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) occurred in Falmouth Bay, Cornwall. At least 26 dolphins died, and a similar number was refloated/herded back to sea. On necropsy, all dolphins were in good nutritive status with empty stomachs and no evidence of known infectious disease or acute physical injury. Auditory tissues were grossly normal (26/26) but had microscopic haemorrhages (5/5) and mild otitis media (1/5) in the freshest cases. Five lactating adult dolphins, one immature male, and one immature female tested were free of harmful algal toxins and had low chemical pollutant levels. Pathological evidence of mud/seawater inhalation (11/26), local tide cycle, and the relative lack of renal myoglobinuria (26/26) suggested MSE onset on a rising tide between 06:30 and 08∶21 hrs (9 June). Potential causes excluded or considered highly unlikely included infectious disease, gas/fat embolism, boat strike, by-catch, predator attack, foraging unusually close to shore, chemical or algal toxin exposure, abnormal weather/climatic conditions, and high-intensity acoustic inputs from seismic airgun arrays or natural sources (e.g., earthquakes). International naval exercises did occur in close proximity to the MSE with the most intense part of the exercises (including mid-frequency sonars) occurring four days before the MSE and resuming with helicopter exercises on the morning of the MSE. The MSE may therefore have been a ""two-stage process"" where a group of normally pelagic dolphins entered Falmouth Bay and, after 3-4 days in/around the Bay, a second acoustic/disturbance event occurred causing them to strand en masse. This spatial and temporal association with the MSE, previous associations between naval activities and cetacean MSEs, and an absence of other identifiable factors known to cause cetacean MSEs, indicates naval activity to be the most probable cause of the Falmouth Bay MSE."
https://openalex.org/W2171448629,"Although we know much about the capacity of neurons to integrate synaptic inputs in vitro, less is known about synaptic integration in vivo. Here we address this issue by investigating the integration of inputs from the two eyes in mouse primary visual cortex. We find that binocular inputs to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons are integrated sublinearly in an amplitude-dependent manner. Sublinear integration was greatest when binocular responses were largest, as occurs at the preferred orientation and binocular disparity, and highest contrast. Using voltage-clamp experiments and modeling, we show that sublinear integration occurs postsynaptically. The extent of sublinear integration cannot be accounted for solely by nonlinear integration of excitatory inputs, even when they are activated closely in space and time, but requires balanced recruitment of inhibition. Finally, we show that sublinear binocular integration acts as a divisive form of gain control, linearizing the output of binocular neurons and enhancing orientation selectivity."

https://openalex.org/W1971607996,"Regulation of oxidative stress responses by the peroxide stress regulator (PerR) is critical for the in vivo fitness and virulence of group A Streptococcus. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of DNA binding, peroxide sensing, and gene regulation by PerR, we performed biochemical and structural characterization of PerR. Sequence-specific DNA binding by PerR does not require regulatory metal occupancy. However, metal binding promotes higher affinity PerR-DNA interactions. PerR metallated with iron directly senses peroxide stress and dissociates from operator sequences. The crystal structure revealed that PerR exists as a homodimer with two metal-binding sites per subunit as follows: a structural zinc site and a regulatory metal site that is occupied in the crystals by nickel. The regulatory metal-binding site in PerR involves a previously unobserved HXH motif located in its unique N-terminal extension. Mutational analysis of the regulatory site showed that the PerR metal ligands are involved in regulatory metal binding, and integrity of this site is critical for group A Streptococcus virulence. Interestingly, the metal-binding HXH motif is not present in the structurally characterized members of ferric uptake regulator (Fur) family but is fully conserved among PerR from the genus Streptococcus. Thus, it is likely that the PerR orthologs from streptococci share a common mechanism of metal binding, peroxide sensing, and gene regulation that is different from that of well characterized PerR from Bacillus subtilis. Together, our findings provide key insights into the peroxide sensing and regulation of the oxidative stress-adaptive responses by the streptococcal subfamily of PerR."
https://openalex.org/W1988194175,"Gliomas represent the most frequent form of primary brain tumors in adults, the prognosis of which remains extremely poor. Inactivating mutations on the tumor suppressor TP53 were proposed as a key etiological trigger of glioma development. p53 has been recently identified as a transcriptional target of parkin. Interestingly, somatic mutations on parkin have also been linked to glioma genesis. We examined the possibility that a disruption of a functional interaction between p53 and parkin could contribute to glioma development in samples devoid of somatic parkin mutations or genetic allele deletion. We show here that parkin levels inversely correlate to brain tumor grade and p53 levels in oligodendrogliomas, mixed gliomas and glioblastomas. We demonstrate that p53 levels negatively and positively correlate to bax and Bcl2 respectively, underlying a loss of p53 transcriptional activity in all types of glial tumors. Using various cell models lacking p53 or harboring either transcriptionally inactive or dominant negative p53, as well as in p53 knockout mice brain, we establish that p53 controls parkin promoter transactivation, mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we document an increase of parkin expression in mice brain after p53-bearing viral infection. Finally, both cancer-related p53 inactivating mutations and deletion of a consensus p53 binding sequence located on parkin promoter abolish p53-mediated control of parkin transcription, demonstrating that p53 regulates parkin transcription via its DNA binding properties. In conclusion, our work delineates a functional interplay between mutated p53 and parkin in glioma genesis that is disrupted by cancer-linked pathogenic mutations. It also allows envisioning parkin as a novel biomarker of glioma biopsies enabling to follow the progression of this type of cancers."

Like many other membrane-spanning proteins, this trimeric protein complex folds and assembles inefficiently in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which results in a substantial percentage of the channel being targeted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Because the spectrum of factors that facilitates the degradation of ENaC is incomplete, we developed yeast expression systems for each ENaC subunit. We discovered that a conserved Hsp70-like chaperone, Lhs1, is required for maximal turnover of the ENaC α subunit. By expressing Lhs1 ATP binding mutants, we also found that the nucleotide exchange properties of this chaperone are dispensable for ENaC degradation. Consistent with the precipitation of an Lhs1-αENaC complex, Lhs1 holdase activity was instead most likely required to support the ERAD of αENaC. Moreover, a complex containing the mammalian Lhs1 homolog GRP170 and αENaC co-precipitated, and GRP170 also facilitated ENaC degradation in human, HEK293 cells, and in a Xenopus oocyte expression system. In both yeast and higher cell types, the effect of Lhs1 on the ERAD of αENaC was selective for the unglycosylated form of the protein. These data establish the first evidence that Lhs1/Grp170 chaperones can act as mediators of ERAD substrate selection."
https://openalex.org/W1975451845,"The radical SAM enzyme Cfr catalyzes methylation of a ribosomal adenosine, causing broad antibiotic resistance. EPR and ENDOR techniques now provide direct evidence for the proposed enzymatic mechanism by detecting a central crosslinked intermediate in which a radical is located on the nucleotide. Cfr-dependent methylation of C8 of A2503 in 23S ribosomal RNA confers bacterial resistance to an array of clinically important antibiotics that target the large subunit of the ribosome, including the synthetic oxazolidinone antibiotic linezolid. The key element of the proposed mechanism for Cfr, a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme, is the addition of a methylene radical, generated by hydrogen-atom abstraction from the methyl group of an S-methylated cysteine, onto C8 of A2503 to form a protein–nucleic acid crosslinked species containing an unpaired electron. Herein we use continuous-wave and pulsed EPR techniques to provide direct spectroscopic evidence for this intermediate, showing a spin-delocalized radical with maximum spin density at N7 of the adenine ring. In addition, we use rapid freeze-quench EPR to show that the radical forms and decays with rate constants that are consistent with the rate of formation of the methylated product."
https://openalex.org/W2007056541,"Simultaneous inhibition of the two major constitutive protein quality control (PQC) pathways, that is, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the aggresome-autophagy system, has been suggested as a promising strategy to trigger cell death in cancer cells. However, we observed that one third of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells survives parallel inhibition of the UPS by Bortezomib and the aggresome-autophagy pathway by the cytoplasmic histone deacetylase 6 inhibitor ST80, and is able to regrow upon drug removal, thus pointing to the induction of compensatory pathways. Here, we identify Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) as a critical mediator of inducible resistance in surviving cells after concomitant blockage of constitutive PQC pathways by mitigating ST80/Bortezomib-triggered proteotoxicity via selective autophagy. ST80/Bortezomib cotreatment upregulates BAG3 mRNA and protein levels in surviving cells in addition to triggering the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates. Intriguingly, knockdown of BAG3 by RNA interference severely impairs clearance of protein aggregates, significantly increases cell death and reduces long-term survival and clonogenic growth during recovery after ST80/Bortezomib cotreatment. Similarly, inhibition of autophagy by inducible autophagy-related protein 7 knockdown prevents removal of protein aggregates and cell regrowth during recovery after ST80/Bortezomib cotreatment. Also, the inhibition of lysosomal degradation using the V-ATPase pump inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 enhances accumulation of protein aggregates, and completely abolishes regrowth after Bortezomib/ST80-induced proteotoxic stress. By identifying BAG3 as a key mediator of inducible resistance by mitigating proteotoxicity via selective autophagy after inhibition of constitutive PQC systems, our study provides new insights into the regulation of PQC pathways in cancer cells and identifies new targets for therapeutic intervention."

This also occurs by UV radiation, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. The effects of a single ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure on hyaluronan content and molecular mass, and expression of genes involved in hyaluronan metabolism were defined in monolayer and differentiated, organotypic three-dimensional cultures of rat epidermal keratinocytes. The signals regulating the response were characterized using specific inhibitors and Western blotting. In monolayer cultures, UVB increased hyaluronan synthase Has1 mRNA already 4 h postexposure, with a return to control level by 24 h. In contrast, Has2 and Has3 were persistently elevated from 8 h onward. Silencing of Has2 and especially Has3 decreased the UVB-induced accumulation of hyaluronan. p38 and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II pathways were found to be involved in the UVB-induced up-regulation of Has2 and Has3 expression, respectively, and their inhibition reduced hyaluronan deposition. However, the expressions of the hyaluronan-degrading enzymes Hyal1 and Hyal2 and the hyaluronan receptor Cd44 were also up-regulated by UVB. In organotypic cultures, UVB treatment also resulted in increased expression of both Has and Hyal genes and shifted hyaluronan toward a smaller size range.

https://openalex.org/W2063656324,"CD99, a transmembrane protein encoded by MIC2 gene is involved in multiple cellular events including cell adhesion and migration, apoptosis, cell differentiation and regulation of protein trafficking either in physiological or pathological conditions. In osteosarcoma, CD99 is expressed at low levels and functions as a tumour suppressor. The full-length protein (CD99wt) and the short-form harbouring a deletion in the intracytoplasmic domain (CD99sh) have been associated with distinct functional outcomes with respect to tumour malignancy. In this study, we especially evaluated modulation of cell–cell contacts, reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton and modulation of signalling pathways by comparing osteosarcoma cells characterised by different metastasis capabilities and CD99 expression, to identify molecular mechanisms responsible for metastasis. Our data indicate that forced expression of CD99wt induces recruitment of N-cadherin and β-catenin to adherens junctions. In addition, transfection of CD99wt inhibits the expression of several molecules crucial to the remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton, such as ACTR2, ARPC1A, Rho-associated, coiled–coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) as well as ezrin, an ezrin/radixin/moesin family member that has been clearly associated with tumour progression and metastatic spread in osteosarcoma. Functional studies point to ROCK2 as a crucial intracellular mediator regulating osteosarcoma migration. By maintaining c-Src in an inactive conformation, CD99wt inhibits ROCK2 signalling and this leads to ezrin decrease at cell membrane while N-cadherin and β-catenin translocate to the plasma membrane and function as main molecular bridges for actin cytoskeleton. Taken together, we propose that the re-expression of CD99wt, which is generally present in osteoblasts but lost in osteosarcoma, through inhibition of c-Src and ROCK2 activity, manages to increase contact strength and reactivate stop-migration signals that counteract the otherwise dominant promigratory action of ezrin in osteosarcoma cells."

https://openalex.org/W2057501724,"Protein tyrosine phosphorylation regulates a wide range of cellular processes at the plasma membrane. Recently, we showed that nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases (SFKs) induces chromatin structural changes. In this study, we identify KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1/TIF1β/TRIM28), a component of heterochromatin, as a nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. Tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 is induced by several tyrosine kinases, such as Src, Lyn, Abl, and Brk. Among SFKs, Src strongly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1. Nucleus-targeted Lyn potentiates tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 compared with intact Lyn, but neither intact Fyn nor nucleus-targeted Fyn phosphorylates KAP1. Substitution of the three tyrosine residues Tyr-449/Tyr-458/Tyr-517, located close to the HP1 binding-motif, into phenylalanine ablates tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1. Immunostaining and chromatin fractionation show that Src and Lyn decrease the association of KAP1 with heterochromatin in a kinase activity-dependent manner. KAP1 knockdown impairs the association of HP1α with heterochromatin, because HP1α associates with KAP1 in heterochromatin. Intriguingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 decreases the association of HP1α with heterochromatin, which is inhibited by replacement of endogenous KAP1 with its phenylalanine mutant (KAP1-Y449F/Y458F/Y517F, KAP1-3YF). In DNA damage, KAP1-3YF repressed transcription of p21. These results suggest that nucleus-localized tyrosine kinases, including SFKs, phosphorylate KAP1 at Tyr-449/Tyr-458/Tyr-517 and inhibit the association of KAP1 and HP1α with heterochromatin."

https://openalex.org/W2044663587,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are an important and abundant component of the extracellular matrix, which undergo substantial remodeling throughout tumorigenesis via the enzymatic activity of heparanase. Heparanase has been shown to be upregulated in many human cancers; however, its specific functions in human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) and spontaneous mouse models of cancer have not been evaluated. Here, we investigated the role of heparanase in PanNETs using patient samples and the RIP1-Tag2 (RT2) PanNET-transgenic mouse model. High heparanase expression significantly correlated with more advanced tumor stage, higher tumor grade and the presence of distant metastasis in PanNET patients. We genetically manipulated heparanase levels in the RT2 model using heparanase-transgenic mice, which constitutively overexpress heparanase, and heparanase-knockout mice. Heparanase was found to have a critical role in promoting tumor invasion, through both macrophage and cancer cell sources in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, elevated heparanase levels significantly increased peritumoral lymphangiogenesis in vivo and promoted the trans-differentiation of macrophages into lymphatic endothelial cell-like structures in culture. Conversely, we found that heparanase deletion led to increased angiogenesis and pericyte coverage. Together, these data identify important roles for heparanase in regulating several critical aspects of tumorigenesis, demonstrating that heparanase represents a potential therapeutic target for PanNET patients."

It is well recognized that there is a close association between a wide range of diseases and protein aggregation. For example, Alzheimer, Parkinson, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and Huntington diseases are characterized by the accumulation of protein deposits or plaques in which the aggregated protein is arranged in highly ordered amyloid fibrils (1Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, functional amyloid, and human disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). Understanding the relationship between the formation of amyloid fibrils and protein aggregation diseases is the focus of much research activity. It is clear that amyloid fibril formation arises from the repertoire of partially folded intermediate states of proteins, and there is significant evidence that the process of aggregation of these states causes cellular toxicity which, in turn, contributes to the particular disease (1Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, functional amyloid, and human disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar).

Like most other sHsps, the α-crystallin subunits exist as large heterogeneous aggregates of a mass range ∼300–1000 kDa (29Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K. Subunit exchange of αA-crystallin.J.

This study exploited the complementary insight obtainable from NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) into the early stages of β2m amyloid fibril formation and the nature of the interaction between αB-crystallin and β2m. For this purpose, we used wild-type β2m and R3Aβ2m under conditions of a convenient time scale for spectroscopic monitoring of processes that precede and lead to β2m aggregation, along with the effects of αB-crystallin on these processes. By use of 1H NMR spectroscopy, we determined that a nonspecific interaction occurs between the exposed surface of R3Aβ2m and αB-crystallin during chaperone action. Furthermore, MS and NMR diffusion coefficient measurements enabled the β2m oligomerization distribution to be quantified in the absence and presence of αB-crystallin. Importantly, αB-crystallin induced dis-aggregation of β2m oligomers. It is concluded that αB-crystallin is multifaceted in its ability to prevent fibril formation by interacting with β2m at the various stages of its aggregation pathway. Recombinant β2m and R3Aβ2m were prepared as described previously (14Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernández H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P.

https://openalex.org/W2039964495,"The Src family kinases c-Src, and its downstream effectors, the Rho family of small GTPases RhoA and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) have a significant role in tumorigenesis. In this report, using the Drosophila wing disc epithelium as a model system, we demonstrate that the actin-Capping Protein (CP) αβ heterodimer, which regulates actin filament (F-actin) polymerization, limits Src-induced apoptosis or tissue overgrowth by restricting JNK activation. We show that overexpressing Src64B drives JNK-independent loss of epithelial integrity and JNK-dependent apoptosis via Btk29A, p120ctn and Rho1. However, when cells are kept alive with the Caspase inhibitor P35, JNK acts as a potent inducer of proliferation via activation of the Yorkie oncogene. Reducing CP levels direct apoptosis of overgrowing Src64B-overexpressing tissues. Conversely, overexpressing capping protein inhibits Src64B and Rho1, but not Rac1-induced JNK signaling. CP requires the actin-binding domain of the α-subunit to limit Src64B-induced apoptosis, arguing that the control of F-actin mediates this effect. In turn, JNK directs F-actin accumulation. Moreover, overexpressing capping protein also prevents apoptosis induced by ectopic JNK expression. Our data are consistent with a model in which the control of F-actin by CP limits Src-induced apoptosis or tissue overgrowth by acting downstream of Btk29A, p120ctn and Rho1, but upstream of JNK. In turn, JNK may counteract the effect of CP on F-actin, providing a positive feedback, which amplifies JNK activation. We propose that cytoskeletal changes triggered by misregulation of F-actin modulators may have a significant role in Src-mediated malignant phenotypes during the early stages of cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2160042242,"The control of mRNA biogenesis is exerted at several steps. In response to extracellular stimuli, stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) modulate gene expression to maximize cell survival. In yeast, the Hog1 SAPK plays a key role in reprogramming the gene expression pattern required for cell survival upon osmostress by acting during transcriptional initiation and elongation. Here, we genetically show that an intact nuclear pore complex is important for cell survival and maximal expression of stress-responsive genes. The Hog1 SAPK associates with nuclear pore complex components and directly phosphorylates the Nup1, Nup2, and Nup60 components of the inner nuclear basket. Mutation of those factors resulted in a deficient export of stress-responsive genes upon stress. Association of Nup1, Nup2, and Nup60 to stress-responsive promoters occurs upon stress depending on Hog1 activity. Accordingly, STL1 gene territory is maintained at the nuclear periphery upon osmostress in a Hog1-dependent manner. Cells containing non-phosphorylatable mutants in Nup1 or Nup2 display reduced expression of stress-responsive genes. Together, proper mRNA biogenesis of stress-responsive genes requires of the coordinate action of synthesis and export machineries by the Hog1 SAPK."

https://openalex.org/W2085848731,"It has been suggested that clec14a may be involved in tumor angiogenesis. However, a molecular mechanism has not been clearly identified. In this study, we show for the first time that C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) of clec14a may be important for regulating cell migration and filopodia formation. Using phage display technology, recombinant human antibodies specific to the CTLDs of human and mouse clec14a (clec14a-CTLD (immunoglobulin G) IgG) were selected. Functional assays using the antibodies showed that clec14a-CTLD IgGs specifically blocked endothelial cell migration and tube formation without affecting cell viability or activation. Further, clec14a-CTLD IgGs inhibited clec14a-mediated cell–cell contact by blocking interaction between CTLDs. Finally, clec14a cross-linking by the clec14a-CTLD IgGs significantly downregulated clec14a expression on the surface of endothelial cells. These results strongly suggest that the clec14a-CTLD may be a key domain in angiogenesis, and that clec14a-CTLD IgGs specifically inhibit angiogenesis by modulating CTLD-mediated cell interactions and clec14a expression on the surface of endothelial cells."

A slower folding of the collagen helix is a potential cause for over-modifications. However, little is known about the rate of folding of type III collagen in patients with EDS. To understand the molecular mechanism of the effect of mutations, a system was developed for bacterial production of homotrimeric model polypeptides. The C-terminal quarter, 252 residues, of the natural human type III collagen was attached to (GPP)7 with the type XIX collagen trimerization domain (NC2).

The tumor suppressor protein ASPP (Apoptosis-Stimulating Proteins of p53) 2 has been implicated in control of cell adhesion and polarity through its effect on the PAR complex. Here we demonstrate that under hypoxic conditions, the ubiquitin ligase Siah (seven in absentia homolog)2 controls ASPP2 availability, with concomitant effect on epithelial cell polarity. LC-MS/MS analysis identified ASPP2 and ASPP1 as Siah2-interacting proteins. Biochemical analysis confirmed this interaction and mapped degron motifs within ASPP2, which are required for Siah2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal-dependent degradation. Inhibition of Siah2 expression increases ASPP2 levels and enhances ASPP2-dependent maintenance of tight junction (TJ) integrity, and polarized architecture in three dimensional (3D) organotypic culture. Conversely, increase of Siah2 expression under hypoxia decreases ASPP2 levels and the formation of apical polarity in 3D culture. In all, our studies demonstrate the role of Siah2 in regulation of TJ integrity and cell polarity under hypoxia, through its regulation of ASPP2 stability."

Significance: We report a new mechanism to control ubiquitin chain elongation. Ubiquitin ligases (E3) of the HECT (homologous to the E6-AP C terminus) family are enzymes that transfer ubiquitin to a substrate through an E3-ubiquitin thioester intermediate (1Scheffner M.

Yeast Rsp5 is a member of the Nedd4 family of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, characterized by a common domain architecture, with a C-terminal catalytic HECT domain, an N-terminal phospholipid-binding C2 domain, and several WW domains responsible for substrate recognition via PY (PXY or PPXY) motifs (2Wang G.

Rsp5 substrates containing such motifs are preferentially modified with long Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro, likely following a simple sequential-addition mechanism (3Kim H.C.

It has been proposed that Ubp2, a deubiquitinating enzyme that antagonizes Rsp5 activity, promotes the monoubiquitination of certain targets by trimming Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains (6Kee Y.

These proteins use their UBD, instead of PY motifs, to interact with a self-ubiquitinated E3 ligase. The proposed model suggests that monoubiquitinated substrates cannot be further polyubiquitinated because the UBD folds back on the conjugated ubiquitin attached in cis, thus disrupting the association of the substrate with the ubiquitinated E3 enzyme. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified how Rsp5 monoubiquitinates proteins that do not have a UBD and use a PY motif for E3 recognition. We previously found that Rsp5 binds to a PY motif in the arrestin-related protein Rim8/Art9 and catalyzes its monoubiquitination in vivo (11Herrador A. Herranz S. Lara D. Vincent O. Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor is mediated by an arrestin-related protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Rim8 is a component of the ambient pH-signaling pathway and acts as an adaptor that mediates the association of the putative pH sensor Rim21 with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). Data indicate that the monoubiquitinated lysine residue in Rim8 contributes to binding to the ESCRT-I subunit Vps23 (11Herrador A. Herranz S. Lara D. Vincent O. Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor is mediated by an arrestin-related protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Rim8 monoubiquitination requires Vps23 and is strongly induced upon overexpression of the Vps23 ubiquitin-binding UEV domain. In this study, we demonstrate, both in vitro and in vivo, that binding of Vps23 UEV to Rim8 favors its monoubiquitination by inhibiting its polyubiquitination. We suggest a model in which interaction of Vps23 UEV with the first conjugated ubiquitin prevents ubiquitin binding to Rsp5 HECT N-lobe and impairs further polyubiquitination.

The sequences encoding Rsp5, Mms2, Vps23, and Vps23 UEV domain (codons 1–161) were amplified from genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae and cloned into a pET19b (Novagen)-derived expression plasmid. The genes encoding Rim8 or the C-terminal fragment Rim8CT (codons 461–542) were designed to encode the cAMP-dependent kinase recognition site (RRASV) at the 5′ end and were cloned into pGEX6p1 (GE Healthcare). Vps23 mutation resulting in a S55A,D56A,G57A (ΔSDG) 4The following multiple mutants designations were used throughout: ΔSDG, S55A,D56A,G57A; ΔPKY, V505A,P506A,K507A,Y508A; ΔSDP, E533A,S534A,D535A,P536A. triple substitution and Rim8 mutations resulting in K507R, K513R, K521R, or K527R substitutions and in the V505A,P506A,K507A,Y508A (ΔPKY) or E533A,S534A,D535A,P536A (ΔSDP) quadruple substitutions were obtained by mutagenic PCR. GST- and His-tagged expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21, and bacterial cells were collected after a 2–3-h induction of protein expression in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-d-1-thiolgalactopyranoside. Cell pellets were resuspended in STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm DTT, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed with a French press. His-tagged Rsp5, Ubc4, Mms2, Vps23, and Vps23 UEV domain were purified using Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) and quantified using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining with BSA standards. GST fusions to Vps23 UEV and to full-length or truncated Rim8 and mutant derivatives were affinity-purified on glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B resin (GE Healthcare). For labeling of proteins with 32P, GST fusions were incubated with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Promega) and adenosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on glutathione beads for 40 min at room temperature. 32P-labeled GST fusions, bound to glutathione-Sepharose, were ubiquitinated in vitro for the indicated times in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml ubiquitin or, where indicated, lysine-less (K0) ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), 4.5 μg/ml E1 (Uba1, Boston Biochem), 6.25 μg/ml E2 (Ubc4), 6.25 μg/ml E3 (Rsp5), and 2.5 mm ATP (40-μl total volume). For pulldown experiments, in vitro ubiquitination assays were performed with twice as much enzyme for 180 min. When indicated, ubiquitination assays were carried out in the presence of purified Vps23, wild type or mutant Vps23 UEV domain, or Mms2 UEV protein. Ubiquitination reactions were initiated by adding ATP and terminated by washing the beads with PreScission protease cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After GST removal by treatment with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) for 16 h at 4 °C, free substrates, retaining the 32P label, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Sepharose beads loaded with GST-Vps23UEV were incubated with in vitro ubiquitinated proteins for 1 h at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of STE buffer with 2% Triton X-100. Beads (bound fraction) were spun down, and proteins in the supernatant (unbound) were TCA-precipitated. Following extensive washing of the beads with the same buffer, bound, unbound, and input materials were boiled in sample buffer, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Yeast strains transformed with pHA-Rim8 were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic dextrose medium. Protein extracts were prepared by alkaline lysis as reported previously (11Herrador A. Herranz S. Lara D. Vincent O. Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor is mediated by an arrestin-related protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and 1 × 107 cell equivalents were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HA (3F10, Roche Applied Science). Antibodies were detected with ECL Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Previous in vivo studies showed that monoubiquitination of Rim8 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 is strongly enhanced by overexpression of the Vps23 ubiquitin-binding UEV domain (11Herrador A. Herranz S. Lara D. Vincent O. Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor is mediated by an arrestin-related protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie this process, we set up an in vitro ubiquitination assay to test whether Vps23 UEV affects Rim8 ubiquitination by Rsp5 in vitro. Strikingly, although Rim8 was efficiently polyubiquitinated by Rsp5 in vitro (Fig. 1A), the amount of monoubiquitinated Rim8 was significantly increased upon the addition of Vps23 UEV. Rim8 contains two arrestin domains and a C-terminal region containing the in vivo ubiquitination site (Lys-521) as well as an Rsp5-binding PKY motif (Fig. 1B) (11Herrador A. Herranz S. Lara D. Vincent O. Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor is mediated by an arrestin-related protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To further analyze the effect of Vps23 UEV on Rim8 ubiquitination, and because in vitro ubiquitination can occur at multiple sites and cause difficulties in the analysis of reaction products, we used as substrate a Rim8 C-terminal fragment (Rim8CT(1K)) containing Lys/Arg substitutions that leave only Lys-521 intact (Fig. 1B). Additionally, and to avoid potential ubiquitination of the terminal amino group of the substrate (3Kim H.C. Huibregtse J.M. Polyubiquitination by HECT E3s and the determinants of chain type specificity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3307-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), ubiquitination assays were performed with a GST fusion to Rim8CT(1K), radiolabeled with 32P at a cAMP-dependent kinase recognition site (RRASV), and the GST tag was removed by protease cleavage after the ubiquitination reaction was terminated (Fig. 1B). Rim8CT(1K) was polyubiquitinated in vitro and was only modified at Lys-521 because no ubiquitinated products were detected with the lysine-less derivative Rim8CT(0K) carrying the K521R substitution (Fig. 1C). In agreement with previous in vivo data (11Herrador A. Herranz S. Lara D. Vincent O. Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor is mediated by an arrestin-related protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), in vitro ubiquitination was not observed with the Rim8CT(1K)ΔPKY mutant derivative, in which the Rsp5-binding PKY motif has been substituted with alanines (Fig. 1C). Strikingly, the addition of Vps23 or the Vps23 UEV domain to the single-lysine substrate Rim8CT(1K) inhibited the formation of polyubiquitinated species, yielding a substrate ligated to only one ubiquitin (Fig. 1, D and E). This effect was only seen above a certain concentration of Vps23 UEV (2 μg/ml) (Fig. 1E), near the approximate stoichiometric equivalence with Rsp5 (UEV = 1.2 μg/ml). In contrast, increased Rim8CT(1K) monoubiquitination was not observed with equivalent or even larger amounts of the UEV domain containing protein Mms2 (Fig. 1F), thus indicating that this effect is not simply due to the presence of a ubiquitin-binding domain in the reaction mixture. To determine whether the effect of the Vps23 UEV domain on Rim8CT(1K) ubiquitination was only due to an inhibition of multiubiquitin chain assembly or also to an increase in the rate of the initial ubiquitination reaction, we performed a time course of ubiquitination of Rim8CT(1K) with K0 ubiquitin, which cannot form ubiquitin chains. In these conditions, even a large amount of Vps23 UEV (8 μg/ml) had no effect on Rim8 monoubiquitination (Fig. 1G), thus indicating that the Vps23 UEV domain does not affect the conjugation of the first ubiquitin. Previous work indicated that the ubiquitin moiety added to Rim8 contributes, together with an SDP motif near the ubiquitinated residue, to binding to the Vps23 UEV domain (Fig. 2A) (11Herrador A. Herranz S. Lara D. Vincent O. Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor is mediated by an arrestin-related protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test whether these two binding sites act synergistically, we carried out a pulldown assay with GST-Vps23UEV as bait and in vitro ubiquitinated Rim8CT(1K) or its mutant derivative Rim8CT(1K)ΔSDP, in which the SDP motif has been substituted with alanines (Fig. 2B). We used stringent conditions (2% Triton) to detect only the strongest interactions. Under these conditions, binding of Vps23 UEV to either ubiquitin or the SDP motif was not sufficient to produce a stable complex because neither the nonubiquitinated form of Rim8CT(1K) nor the ubiquitinated form of Rim8CT(1K)ΔSDP was retained by Vps23 UEV (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 5). In contrast, a strong interaction was detected between Vps23 UEV and the monoubiquitinated or polyubiquitinated forms of Rim8CT(1K) (Fig. 2B, lane 2), thus indicating that simultaneous binding of the monoubiquitinated residue and the SDP motif to Vps23 UEV strengthens the overall binding. To further characterize the mechanisms underlying Rim8 monoubiquitination in vitro, we tested whether Vps23 UEV binding to ubiquitin and SDP motif is required for the inhibition of Rim8 polyubiquitination. Fig. 2C shows a time course of ubiquitination of Rim8CT(1K) or Rim8CT(1K)ΔSDP, in the absence or presence of either Vps23 UEV or the Vps23 UEVΔSDG mutant derivative carrying an S55A,D56A,G57A substitution in the β-hairpin tongue (15Teo H. Veprintsev D.B. Williams R.L. Structural insights into endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-I) recognition of ubiquitinated proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28689-28696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which impairs ubiquitin binding without affecting binding to the SDP motif (11Herrador A. Herranz S. Lara D. Vincent O. Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor is mediated by an arrestin-related protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Rim8 polyubiquitination was strictly dependent on binding of Vps23 UEV to both ubiquitin and SDP motif because the accumulation of monoubiquitinated Rim8CT(1K) upon the addition of Vps23 UEV (Fig. 2C, compare panel b with panel a) was not observed with the Rim8CT(1K)ΔSDP or Vps23 UEVΔSDG mutant proteins (Fig. 2C, panels c and d). These findings, together with previous in vivo data (11Herrador A. Herranz S. Lara D. Vincent O. Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor is mediated by an arrestin-related protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), support the idea that binding of the UEV domain to both the SDP motif and the monoubiquitinated residue prevents its further polyubiquitination by Rsp5. Although the Rim8 Lys-521 residue is the physiological site of ubiquitination (11Herrador A. Herranz S. Lara D. Vincent O. Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor is mediated by an arrestin-related protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we were able to detect in vitro ubiquitination, albeit at a lower efficiency, of a Rim8 C-terminal fragment (Rim8CT(3K)) lacking Lys-521 but containing the other three lysine residues present at the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 2D, lane 3). However, monoubiquitination of this substrate, in contrast to that of Rim8CT(1K), was not increased upon the addition of the Vps23 UEV domain (Fig. 2D), thus suggesting that the precise location of the Lys-521 residue plays an important role in this process. Previous in vivo studies showed that monoubiquitinated Rim8 is undetectable in a vps23Δ mutant (11Herrador A. Herranz S. Lara D. Vincent O. Recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to a putative seven-transmembrane-domain receptor is mediated by an arrestin-related protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In light of our present results, it is likely that monoubiquitinated Rim8 is further polyubiquitinated and possibly degraded in the absence of Vps23. This assumption predicts that inhibition of multiubiquitin chain assembly in a vps23Δ mutant should restore normal levels of monoubiquitinated Rim8. Because Rsp5 preferentially catalyzes the formation of Lys-63-linked chains in vivo (6Kee Y. Muñoz W. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. The deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp2 modulates Rsp5-dependent Lys63-linked polyubiquitin conjugates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol.

Fig. 3A shows that expression of UbK63R in a vps23Δ mutant restores near normal levels of monoubiquitinated Rim8, which migrates as a doublet due to protein phosphorylation. 5A. Herrador and O.

We noted that levels of monoubiquitinated Rim8 were reproducibly higher in wild type cells expressing UbK63R (Fig. 3A, compare lane 2 with lane 4), which may be due to the formation of ubiquitin chains linked through lysine residues other than Lys-63 in the absence of Vps23. In summary, these results indicate that the absence of detectable levels of monoubiquitinated Rim8 in a vps23Δ mutant is mainly due to its polyubiquitination via Lys-63 linkage, thus supporting our in vitro data that the Vps23 UEV domain prevents multiubiquitin chain assembly. The lack of detection of polyubiquitin laddering in the vps23Δ mutant may simply be caused by the low abundance of ubiquitinated Rim8, which is barely detectable as a single band in the wild type strain, or may result from either the degradation or the concurrent deubiquitination of the polyubiquitinated protein. The results presented here address the molecular mechanism through which the ubiquitin-binding UEV domain of Vps23 directs the activity of the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase toward the formation of monoubiquitinated Rim8. Our in vitro and in vivo data support the idea that Vps23 UEV promotes Rim8 monoubiquitination by preventing its further polyubiquitination. We propose the following models (Fig. 3B) for the mechanism of action of the Vps23 UEV domain. In the first step, Rsp5 binds to the PKY motif at Rim8 C terminus and catalyzes the conjugation of a single ubiquitin to the Lys-521 residue. In the absence of Vps23 (Fig. 3B, top), the chain is elongated by conjugation of an additional ubiquitin molecule via a Lys-63 linkage. Previous work showed that ubiquitin chain extension is dependent on an ubiquitin-binding site in the N-lobe of the Nedd4/Rsp5 HECT domain (Fig. 3B, top), which would orient the first ubiquitin to allow the addition of the next one and may also contribute to the interaction of the ubiquitinated substrate with the E3 (17Kim H.C.

Structure of the HECT:ubiquitin complex and its role in ubiquitin chain elongation.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, two models can be envisaged to explain how Vps23 prevents the second conjugation reaction. In the first model (Fig. 3B), interaction of the Vps23 UEV domain with ubiquitin could prevent further ubiquitination by restricting Lys-63 accessibility. However, previous findings do not support this hypothesis because Lys-63 is fully exposed in the Vps23 UEV-ubiquitin complex (Fig. 3C) (15Teo H. Veprintsev D.B. Williams R.L. Structural insights into endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-I) recognition of ubiquitinated proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28689-28696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and SDP binding is not expected to produce any conformational changes in the UEV domain (19Ren X. Hurley J.H. Structural basis for endosomal recruitment of ESCRT-I by ESCRT-0 in yeast.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 2130-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additionally, we showed that Rim8 polyubiquitination does not impair the ubiquitin-dependent interaction with Vps23 UEV in pulldown assays (Fig. 2B), thus strongly suggesting that the acceptor lysine residue in ubiquitin is located outside of the UEV-interacting surface. We therefore favor a second model (Fig. 3B) in which competition of the Vps23 UEV domain with the Rsp5 N-lobe for binding to the first conjugated ubiquitin prevents its correct positioning and impairs further polyubiquitination. Additionally, the inability of Rsp5 to bind ubiquitin may weaken its interaction with the monoubiquitinated substrate. The most compelling evidence for this competition model is that both the UEV domain and the Rsp5 N-lobe, which bind ubiquitin with low affinity, recognize the same hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin (15Teo H. Veprintsev D.B. Williams R.L. Structural insights into endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-I) recognition of ubiquitinated proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28689-28696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Kim H.C. Steffen A.M. Oldham M.L. Chen J. Huibregtse J.M. Structure and function of a HECT domain ubiquitin-binding site.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, these two interactions are mutually exclusive, and binding of Vps23 UEV to the first conjugated ubiquitin should preclude ubiquitin chain extension (Fig. 3B). In this context, the Rsp5/Vps23 UEV stoichiometry could play an important role, as suggested by our in vitro data that Vps23 UEV prevents ubiquitin chain elongation above a minimum threshold value near the equimolar Rsp5/UEV concentration. Additionally, the relative position of the SDP motif with respect to the ubiquitinated lysine residue in Rim8 should also be critical in positioning the UEV domain to favor its interaction with the first conjugated ubiquitin. This observation is consistent with our findings that Vps23 UEV does not prevent the polyubiquitination of lysine residues other than Lys-521 in vitro (Fig. 2D) and with the high level of conservation of the distance between Lys-521 and the SDP motif in Rim8 homologs in other fungi (11Herrador A.

Biol. 2010; 30: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In summary, our findings reveal a new mechanism by which the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase, together with the UBD-containing protein Vps23, promotes the monoubiquitination of the ESCRT-I adaptor Rim8. In the process referred to as coupled monoubiquitination, some UBD-containing substrates of Nedd4/Rsp5 undergo monoubiquitination in a UBD-dependent manner (8Woelk T. Oldrini B. Maspero E.

A ubiquitin-binding motif required for intramolecular monoubiquitylation, the CUE domain.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Here, we extend these findings and show that a UBD can also promote protein monoubiquitination when acting in trans, thus opening the possibility that other monoubiquitinated substrates of Rsp5, which bind to UBD-containing proteins, are regulated in a similar fashion. Interestingly, the Vps23 mammalian homolog, Tsg101, appears to promote the monoubiquitination of the apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor by preventing its further polyubiquitination (20Burgdorf S. Leister P. Scheidtmann K.H. TSG101 interacts with apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor and enhances androgen receptor-mediated transcription by promoting its monoubiquitination.J. Biol.

Further work will be required to determine whether Tsg101 plays a similar role as Vps23 in the regulation of ubiquitin chain elongation.

To improve the effectiveness of these therapies selectively in cancer tissue is important for avoiding side effects. Early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1) is known to have the function to inhibit anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome ubiquitin ligase complex, which ubiquitylates the cell cycle-related proteins.

Significance: This work provides new insights regarding synergistic effect of Emi1 knockdown in combination therapies. Approximately 12.7 million cancers were diagnosed and 7.6 million people died of cancer worldwide in 2008 (1Jemal A. Bray F. Center M.M. Ferlay J. Ward E. Forman D. Global cancer statistics.CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2011; 61: 69-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30317) Google Scholar). This makes cancer the leading cause of death in the developed world and the second leading cause of death in the developing world (1Jemal A. Bray F. Center M.M. Ferlay J. Ward E. Forman D. Global cancer statistics.CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2011; 61: 69-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30317) Google Scholar). Cancer can be treated by various means such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and monoclonal antibody therapy. The choice of therapy depends upon the location and grade of the tumor and the stage of the disease, as well as the physical condition of the patient. Complete inactivation of the cancer without damage to the rest of the body is the goal of treatment. Sometimes this can be accomplished by surgery, but the propensity of cancers to invade adjacent tissues or to spread to distant sites by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness. Chemotherapy alone or in combination with other treatments such as surgery or radiation has proven useful in a number of different cancer types, but the effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by the toxicity to non-targeted tissues in the body. The majority of chemotherapeutic drugs can be divided into alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anthracyclines, plant alkaloids, topoisomerase inhibitors, and other anticancer agents (2Takimoto C.H. Calvo E. Principles of Oncologic Pharmacotherapy.in: Pazdur R. Wagman L.D. Camphausen K.A. Hoskins W.J. Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach. 11th Ed.

Cellular determinants of sensitivity and resistance to DNA topoisomerase inhibitors.Cancer Invest. 1994; 12: 530-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). All of these drugs affect cell division or DNA synthesis and act by killing cells that divide rapidly, one of the main properties of most cancer cells. Anticancer agents also harm cells that divide rapidly under normal circumstances: cells in the bone marrow, digestive tracts, and hair follicles. These effects result in the common side effects of chemotherapy, including myelosuppression, mucositis, and alopecia. Therefore, newer anticancer drugs, including monoclonal antibodies and the new tyrosine kinase inhibitors, e.g. imatinib mesylate (Gleevec or Glivec), which directly targets a molecular abnormality in certain types of cancer (chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors), have been used (4Dancey J.E. Bedard P.L. Onetto N. Hudson T.J. The genetic basis for cancer treatment decisions.Cell. 2012; 148: 409-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Targeted therapy is a type of medication that blocks the growth of cancer cells by interfering with specific targeted molecules needed for carcinogenesis and tumor growth, rather than by simply interfering with rapidly dividing cells. Targeted cancer therapies thus are expected to be more effective than conventional treatments and less harmful to normal cells. Many oncologists believe that targeted therapies are the chemotherapy of the future. At present, however, many traditional anticancer drugs for targeting DNA synthesis to interfere with rapidly dividing cells are commonly used. Radiation therapy is the medical application of ionizing radiation to suppressing tumor growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging DNA to control tumor cell growth/division, but the effect of radiation in normal tissues cannot be avoided in these therapies. The cell cycle is regulated by cell cycle regulation factors and many of these are degraded via ubiquitylation (5Reed S. Ratchets and clocks: the cell cycle, ubiquitylation and protein turnover.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Abnormality of ubiquitylation in degradation of proteins induces various diseases such as cancer (6Pagano M. Benmaamar R. When protein destruction runs amok, malignancy is on the loose.Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 251-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Yamasaki L. Pagano M.

Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). It is known that SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) and anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), 4The abbreviations used are: APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; DSB, double-stranded break; PI, propidium iodide; EdU, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine; NHDF, neonatal normal human dermal fibroblast. ubiquitin ligases, are involved in ubiquitylation of cell cycle regulating factors (9Peters J.M.

The SCF ubiquitin ligase: insights into a molecular machine.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). In particular, APC/C is associated with the degradation of proteins in the M-G1 phase and plays a role in the regulation of spindle checkpoint and procession from the M to G1 phase. APC/C is composed of several dozen subunits, and its activity is regulated by co-activators Cdc20 or Cdh1 and phosphorylation of constitutive subunits (9Peters J.M. The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome: a machine designed to destroy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Activity of APC/CCdc20 increases from the prophase to prometaphase, and decrease in the anaphase by Cdc20 degradation (9Peters J.M. The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome: a machine designed to destroy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). However, activity of APC/CCdh1 is maintained from the anaphase to G1/S phase, after which the activity is inhibited by Emi1 (11Hsu J.Y. Reimann J.D. Sørensen C.S. Lukas J. Jackson P.K. E2F-dependent accumulation of hEmi1 regulates S phase entry by inhibiting APCCdh1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Emi1 was identified as a factor inhibiting the function of APC/CCdh1 and is degraded by SCFβTrcp at early M phase (12Reimann J.D. Gardner B.E. Margottin-Goguet F. Jackson P.K.

Moreover, inhibition of Emi1 interferes with progression to M phase by degradation of geminin, which is necessary for the completion of DNA synthesis (18Machida Y.J. Dutta A.

Emi1-depleted cells show polyploidy and large nuclei because these cells cannot complete DNA synthesis (18Machida Y.J. Dutta A.

Emi1 is needed to couple DNA replication with mitosis but does not regulate activation of the mitotic APC/C.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we speculated that inhibition of Emi1 in cancer cells might enhance the sensitivity of anticancer agents. Moreover, cells lacking Emi1 undergo DNA damage, likely explained by replication stress (20Verschuren E.W. Ban K.H. Masek M.A. Lehman N.L. Jackson P.K.

In this study, we also examined the combined effects by one of the major anticancer agents, doxorubicin, and Emi1 depletion in various tumor cells. Doxorubicin hydrochloride, camptothecin, etoposide, taxol (paclitaxel), and cobalt chloride (CoCl2) were obtained from Sigma. Commercial antibodies were from the following companies: anti-Emi1 and anti-Cul1 antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-Aurora-A antibody and anti-fypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) (Transduction Laboratories); anti-cyclin A and anti-cyclin B antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Cdh1 and anti-Cdc20 antibodies, MBL; anti-E2F1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology); and anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Anti-geminin polyclonal antibody was gift from Dr. Nishitani (University of Hyogo), and anti-TPX2 monoclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. Hans-Jürgen Heidebrecht (University of Kiel). For detection of the immunocomplex, the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Sixty tissue samples of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were retrieved from the Surgical Pathology Registry of Hiroshima University Hospital, after approval by the Ethical Committee of Hiroshima University Hospital. Sixty head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cases were surgically resected before radiochemotherapy. Clinical information was gathered from surgical records of the patients. The histological grade of tumor was classified according to the criteria of the Japan Society for Head and Neck Cancer. Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Six head and neck cancer cell lines (HSC2, HSC3, HSC4, Ca9–22, Ho-1-N-1, and Ho-1-U-1), glioma cell line (T98G), and normal human lung fibroblasts (HFLIII) were provided by the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank. HOC119, HOC313, HOC621, HOC719-PE, HOC719-NE, TSU, OM-1, and ZA cells have been described previously (21Yokoyama K. Kamata N. Fujimoto R. Tsutsumi S. Tomonari M. Taki M. Hosokawa H. Nagayama M. Increased invasion and matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression by Snail-induced mesenchymal transition in squamous cell carcinomas.Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). Breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), colon cancer cell line (RKO and HCT116), osteosarcoma cell line (SaOS-2), and human breast epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) were purchased from ATCC. HaCaT cell line was obtained from N. E. Fusenig (German Cancer Research Center). The p53-null HCT116 cell line was obtained from B. Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) under conditions of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Upon receiving the cell lines, they were immediately cultured and expanded to prepare frozen ampule stocks. Cells were passaged for no more than 2 to 3 months before establishing new culture from early-passage frozen ampules. Using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), total RNA from cultures of confluent cells and tissues was isolated. These isolates were quantified and their purity was evaluated by spectrophotometer. The cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA according to ReverTra Dash (Toyobo Biochemicals, Tokyo, Japan). We used the following primers: human Emi1, 5′-tctttcgaaggggactcaga-3′ (forward) and 5′-tctggttgaagcatgaggtg-3′ (reverse); human GAPDH, 5′-tccaccaccctgttgctgta-3′ (forward) and 5′-accacagtccatgccatcac-3′ (reverse). Aliquots of total cDNA were amplified with 1.25 units of rTaq-DNA polymerase (Qiagen), and this amplification was done in a thermal cycler (MyCyler, Bio-Rad) for 30 cycles after initial 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C in all primers used. The amplification reaction products were resolved on 1.2% agarose/TAE gels (Nacalai Tesque), electrophoresed at 100 mV, and then finally visualized by using ethidium bromide. Tumor tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut 4 μm thick. For immunohistochemical staining, tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in descending grades of ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with methanol containing 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min. Antigen retrieval was done by the microwaving using a citrate phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and then the sections were incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out by a polyclonal anti-Emi1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.). For detection of the reaction after incubation with secondary antibodies, we used diaminobenzidine (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). The sections were counterstained by hematoxylin and dehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol, and the slides were mounted. For evaluation of staining intensity, we graded + (weak/focal immunopositivity), ++ (strong/focal immunopositivity and weak/diffuse immunopositivity), +++ (strong/diffuse immunopositivity). Then, the expression of Emi1 was graded as high (>30% of tumor cells showing ++ or +++ intensity) or low (no staining or <30% of tumor cells showing + intensity). Western blotting was carried out as described previously (15Guardavaccaro D. Kudo Y. Boulaire J. Barchi M. Busino L. Donzelli M. Margottin-Goguet F. Jackson P.K. Yamasaki L. Pagano M. Control of meiotic and mitotic progression by the F box protein β-Trcp1 in vivo.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 799-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were measured by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Twenty μg of protein was subjected to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by electroblotting onto a nitrocellulose filter. For detection of the immunocomplex, the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used. For proliferation assay, 5000 cells were plated onto a 24-well plate, and the cells were allowed to grow and expand. The cells were then trypsinized and counted at 0, 2, 4, and 6 days by using cell counter (Coulter Z1, Beckman-Coulter). Doubling time was calculated by rate of cell proliferation. Cells were seeded on glass coverslips. Forty eight hours after incubation, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with pSer-10 histone H3 (Millipore) and DAPI. pSer-10 histone H3-positive and condensed chromatin cells were counted as mitotic cells. More than 400 cells were scored per condition. Logarithmically growing cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells/6-cm dish and transfected with oligonucleotides at 24 h after replating by using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, lysates were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The siRNA is a 19-bp duplex oligoribonucleotide with a sense strand corresponding to nucleotides 1446–1464 of the human Emi1 mRNA sequence; 5′-GAUUGUGAUCUCUUAUUAA-3′ (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL). Human cyclin A siRNA (sc-29282) and human E2F1 siRNA (sc-61861) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The negative control (siTrio negative control siRNA) was obtained from Cosmo Bio, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Cells grown on cover slips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After rinsing three times with PBS, coverslips were incubated with DAPI staining. Immunostaining of cell preparations was recorded using an epifluorescence Zeiss Axioplan 2 (Zeiss, Inc., Thorwood, NY) microscope attached to a charge-coupled device camera. For staining with γH2AX, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were then permeabilized for 2 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS and washed twice in PBS. Antibodies were diluted with 4% w/v BSA in PBS. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-γH2AX antibody (Millipore) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times in PBS, and incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were incubated in PBS containing DAPI for 5 min to stain the DNA and mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured using an Olympus DP70 fluorescence microscope. Cell scoring was carried out blindly with >200 cells/sample (× two individual experiments). Cell cycle distribution was determined by DNA content analysis after propidium iodide (PI) staining (Sigma). Cells were cultured as described above, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stored at 4 °C before analysis. Flow cytometric determination of DNA content was performed on a FACS Calibur (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) flow cytometer. For each sample, 20,000 events were stored. For flow cytometric analysis of γH2AX, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed for 10 min in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and post-fixed in 70% ethanol for at least 2 h at −20 °C. After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 10 min on ice in hybridization buffer (PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100). After centrifugation, cells were hybridized with mouse anti-γH2AX antibody (Millipore) diluted at a ratio of 1:400 in hybridization buffer and incubated for 2 h in the dark at room temperature. Cells were washed with hybridization buffer and incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed twice with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and stained with PI solution (PBS containing 5 μg/ml PI, 100 μg/ml RNase A) for 30 min before flow cytometry. For the labeling of DNA synthesis, cells were cultured with 10 μm EdU for 1 h. EdU-incorporated cells were detected by using the Click-it® EdU imaging kit (Invitrogen). EdU staining was conducted following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed once with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 buffer for 10 min, washed once, treated with the click-reaction mixture for 30 min, washed once, and resuspended in buffer before staining of DNA content with PI solution. After doxorubicin treatment, the cells were then stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D, using the phycoerythrin-annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptotic cells were identified by dual-staining with recombinant phycoerythrin-conjugated with annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D. Data acquisition and analysis were done in a FACS Calibur (Becton-Dickinson) flow cytometer using CellQuest software. Sensitivity to radiation was evaluated by colony formation assays. Cells were irradiated with x-rays (1.2 gray/min) generated by a TITAN x-ray irradiator (Shimadzu, Japan) at room temperature. After irradiation, cells were trypsinized and plated onto 100-mm culture dishes at appropriate cell density. After incubated for 10–14 days, cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 100% ethanol, and stained by crystal violet. Colonies consisting of >50 cells were scored as survivor. Statistical analyses were performed using STATVIEW (Abacus Concepts, Piscataway, NJ), and a Fidher protected least significant difference multiple-comparison test was used for all of the analyses in this study. Overall differences between the groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance, and Fisher protected least significant difference multiple comparison test was applied when the results of one-way analysis of variance were significant (p < 0.05). Recent reports show that high expression of Emi1 protein can be observed in various cancers (14Margottin-Goguet F. Hsu J.Y. Loktev A. Hsieh H.M. Reimann J.D. Jackson P.K.

Moreover, we investigated Emi1 expression in various tumor tissues by using the Oncomine database. As compared with normal counterparts, Emi1 expression was significantly increased in many types of tumors, such as head and neck, breast, prostate, cervix, pancreas, and brain tumors (Fig. 1B). Then, we examined the expression of Emi1 protein in head and neck cancer cases by immunohistochemistry. Emi1 expression was graded as high (over 30% of tumor cells showing ++ or +++ intensity) or low (no staining or less than 30% of tumor cells showing + intensity). Indeed, most cases with high expression of Emi1 showed strong and diffuse immunopositivity and most cases with low expression of Emi1 showed no or weak immunopositivity. Expression level of Emi1 in cancer cells was much higher than that in non-neoplastic cells (Fig. 1C). High Emi1 expression was observed in 53.3% of head and neck cancer cases and was well correlated with histological differentiation and lymph node metastasis (Table 1). Moreover, we compared the expression of Emi1 with p53 and APC/C substrates, cyclin A, Skp2, and Aurora-A in cancer tissues (Fig. 1D and Table 1). Interestingly, Emi1 expression was well correlated with p53 expression and APC/C substrates (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of Emi1 expression in head and neck cancerEmi1 expressionTotalLowHighp valueHead and neck cancer6028 (46.7%)32 (53.3%)Histological differentiationWell118 (72.7%)3 (27.3%)0.02Moderate3718 (48.6%)19 (51.4%)0.02Poor122 (16.7%)10 (83.3%)0.02Lymph node metastasisNegative4023 (57.5%)17 (42.5%)0.02Positive205 (25.0%)15 (75.0%)0.02Cyclin A expressionLow2721 (77.8%)6 (22.2%)0.00001High337 (21.2%)26 (78.8%)0.00001Skp2 expressionLow2515 (60.0%)10 (40.0%)0.08High3513 (37.1%)22 (62.9%)0.08Aurora-A expressionLow2719 (70.3%)8 (29.7%)0.0008High339 (27.3%)24 (72.7%)0.0008p53 expressionLow1913 (68.4%)6 (31.6%)0.02High4115 (36.6%)26 (63.4%)0.02 Open table in a new tab As Emi1 itself is an E2F target gene, Emi1 mRNA overexpression might be caused by activated E2F in cancer cells (20Verschuren E.W.

In addition, there is a growing appreciation that ubiquitination can influence protein activity and localization. Ste7 is a prototype MAPKK in yeast that participates in both the pheromone signaling and nutrient deprivation/invasive growth pathways. We have shown previously that Ste7 is ubiquitinated upon pheromone stimulation.

Biol. Chem. 2013, 288, 18660–18671 Full-Text PDF Open Access MAPK cascades function as signal transduction modules, linking diverse extracellular signals to cell fate decisions. These pathways are initiated by virtually every mitogenic stimulus (1Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Mitogen-activated protein kinases: versatile transducers for cell signaling.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and they evoke fundamental cellular events, including gene transcription, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, differentiation, and motility (2Davis R.J.

The core of the MAPK signaling module consists of three protein kinases that are sequentially activated by a phosphorylation cascade as follows: a MAP 2The abbreviations used are:MAP, mitogen-activated protein; DUB, deubiquitinating protease. kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and a MAP kinase (MAPK). The MAPKs then phosphorylate effector proteins and transcription factors to alter cellular behavior. So far, 14 MAPKKKs, 7 MAPKKs, and 12 MAPKs have been identified in mammalian cells (6Cargnello M. Roux P.P. Activation and function of the MAPKs and their substrates, the MAPK-activated protein kinases.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2011; 75: 50-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Because these signaling modules are used to mediate such diverse signaling inputs, many will utilize the same signaling proteins to elicit very different outputs. One of the central questions of biology is how cells are able to produce the correct cellular response when so many of the components are shared among the different pathways (7Chen R.E. Thorner J. Function and regulation in MAPK signaling pathways: lessons learned from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1311-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The yeast mating pathway employs a canonical MAPK cascade. The mating response is mediated by the binding of pheromone to a G-protein-coupled receptor (Ste2/3) that activates a heterotrimeric G-protein, consisting of a Gα subunit (Gpa1) and a Gβγ dimer (Ste4/Ste18). The Gβγ dimer propagates the mating signal through activation of effector proteins, including a protein kinase (Ste20), a kinase scaffolding protein (Ste5), and the Cdc42 GDP-GTP exchange factor (Cdc24). These effectors go on to activate a MAPK cascade composed of a MAPK kinase kinase (Ste11), which phosphorylates and activates a dual specificity MAPK kinase (Ste7), which in turn phosphorylates and activates two related MAPKs (Fus3 and Kss1) (8Bardwell L. A walk-through of the yeast mating pheromone response pathway.Peptides. 2005; 26: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 9Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Inouye C.J. Thorner J.

Neiman A.M. Herskowitz I. Signal transduction during pheromone response in yeast.Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 699-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Major downstream targets of the MAPKs include a transcription factor, Ste12, and a component of the cell cycle regulatory machinery, Far1 (11Elion E.A. Satterberg B. Kranz J.E. FUS3 phosphorylates multiple components of the mating signal transduction cascade: evidence for STE12 and FAR1.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these proteins leads to new gene transcription, G1 arrest and, eventually, mating competency. In addition to the pheromone response, MAPK cascades in yeast also mediate responses to environmental stress and nutritional status (12Posas F. Takekawa M. Saito H. Signal transduction by MAP kinase cascades in budding yeast.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 13Levin D.E. Errede B. The proliferation of MAP kinase signaling pathways in yeast.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These pathways utilize two or more signaling proteins that are also involved in the pheromone response pathway. For instance, the pheromone and invasive growth/nutrient deprivation pathways share the MAPKKK Ste11 and the MAPKK Ste7 (14Gagiano M. Bauer F.F. Pretorius I.S. The sensing of nutritional status and the relationship to filamentous growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 2: 433-470PubMed Google Scholar, 15Palecek S.P. Parikh A.S. Kron S.J. Sensing, signalling, and integrating physical processes during Saccharomyces cerevisiae invasive and filamentous growth.Microbiology. 2002; 148: 893-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Despite the high degree of similarity between these pathways, yeast have evolved multiple mechanisms to maintain proper activity and specificity within the MAPK cascades (7Chen R.E. Thorner J. Function and regulation in MAPK signaling pathways: lessons learned from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1311-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Certain modifications such as phosphorylation, which drives the activity of MAPK cascades, are well established as regulators of cellular signaling intensity. Other modifications, such as sumoylation, glycosylation, acylation, lipidation, and ubiquitination are also emerging as regulators of cell signaling (16Molina M. Cid V.J. Martín H. Fine regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAPK pathways by post-translational modifications.Yeast. 2010; 27: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Whelan J.T. Hollis S.E. Cha D.S. Asch A.S. Lee M.H. Post-transcriptional regulation of the Ras-ERK/MAPK signaling pathway.J. Cell. Physiol. 2012; 227: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is a tightly regulated process by which the small 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin is attached to lysine residues on target proteins. Attachment of ubiquitin is mediated by a three-step process involving an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ubiquitin ligase (18Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6879) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity is controlled by E3, which is frequently recruited via the post-translational modification (phosphorylation) of target proteins. The Skp1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase is a multiprotein complex that utilizes an assortment of F-box proteins to identify phosphorylated substrates (19Cardozo T. Pagano M. The SCF ubiquitin ligase: insights into a molecular machine.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Although each component of the SCF is necessary for ubiquitin ligase function, the F-box protein binds directly to the substrate and therefore defines substrate specificity of the SCF complex. Previous work has shown that Cdc34 and the SCF complex regulate mating-associated cell cycle arrest (20Henchoz S. Chi Y. Catarin B. Herskowitz I. Deshaies R.J. Peter M.

We recently demonstrated that SCF complexes are required for proper MAPK activation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are likely to target multiple components within the pathway (23Cappell S.D.

Biol. 2009; 29: 582-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Like many other post-translational modifications, ubiquitination is reversible. Deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs) cleave ubiquitin-ubiquitin and ubiquitin-protein bonds, mediate recruitment of substrates to the proteasome, and remove polyubiquitin chains from substrates to facilitate proteasomal entry. Thus, DUBs have the potential to regulate any ubiquitin-mediated process. There are 17 DUBs in yeast and 95 DUBs in humans, suggesting a high degree of substrate specificity. Additionally, DUB activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation. New roles in cellular signaling pathways are emerging as new DUB substrates and functionalities are identified (25Reyes-Turcu F.E. Ventii K.H. Wilkinson K.D. Regulation and cellular roles of ubiquitin-specific deubiquitinating enzymes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 363-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate dynamic ubiquitination of the MAPKK Ste7. Ste7 expression is tightly regulated, and stochastic modeling of the pheromone pathway suggests that very small changes in Ste7 abundance can have a significant impact on pathway activation (26Hao N. Yildirim N. Nagiec M.J. Parnell S.C. Errede B. Dohlman H.G. Elston T.C.

Systems biology analysis of G protein and MAP kinase signaling in yeast.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3254-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Additionally, Ste7 is the direct activator of two related MAPKs, Fus3 and Kss1. Although both MAPKs are activated during pheromone signaling, Fus3 is primarily responsible for the mating response (28Breitkreutz A. Boucher L. Tyers M. MAPK specificity in the yeast pheromone response independent of transcriptional activation.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1266-1271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Farley F.W. Satterberg B. Goldsmith E.J. Elion E.A.

Cell. 2001; 8: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Kss1 alone is activated during invasive growth (31Tedford K. Kim S. Sa D. Stevens K. Tyers M. Regulation of the mating pheromone and invasive growth responses in yeast by two MAP kinase substrates.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 228-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We previously found that Ste7 undergoes both SCF-dependent ubiquitination and Ubp3-dependent deubiquitination, indicating that ubiquitination of Ste7 plays a critical role in pheromone pathway activation (32Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. Pheromone-dependent ubiquitination of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase Ste7.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15766-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Wang Y. Ge Q. Houston D. Thorner J. Errede B. Dohlman H.G.

Given that Ste7 acts upstream of both Fus3 and Kss1, we hypothesized that dynamic ubiquitination of Ste7 contributes to MAPK signaling specificity. Herein, we demonstrate that Ste7 is recognized by the F-box protein Cdc4 and directly ubiquitinated by the SCFCdc4 ubiquitin ligase. Disruption of SCFCdc4 attenuates the activation of Fus3, but not Kss1. In contrast, disruption of Ubp3 enhances the activation of Kss1, but not Fus3. Finally, we show that Fus3 phosphorylates Ubp3 and that phosphorylation is needed for Ubp3 to limit Kss1 activation in vivo. Taken together, these data demonstrate that dynamic ubiquitination of Ste7 modulates the strength and specificity of MAPK activation and that the cycle of ubiquitination/deubiquitination is controlled by both upstream stimulation and MAPK-mediated feedback loops. Standard procedures for the growth, maintenance, and transformation of yeast and bacteria and for the manipulation of DNA were used throughout. Yeast strains used in this study were BY4741 (MATa leu2Δ met15Δ his3-1 ura3Δ), BY4741-derived strains lacking STE7 (ste7::KANMX4, resistance to geneticin), UBP3 (ubp3::HPHMX4, resistance to hygromycin B), KSS1 (kss1::NATMX4, resistance to nourseothricin), TEC1 (tec1::KANMX4), and R1158 (MATa URA3::CMV-tTA leu2Δ met15Δ his3-1 ura3Δ) purchased as the yeast Tet-promoter Hughes Collection (yTHC, Open Biosystems). Deletion strains were validated by PCR amplification of genomic DNA. The Tet-Off strains were originally created from the background strain BY4741 by a one-step integration of the tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator, under the control of the CMV promoter, at the URA3 locus. A plasmid carrying a kanR-tetO7-TATA cassette was then integrated into the genome replacing the endogenous promoter. The yeast shuttle plasmids used were pRS315 (CEN, ampR, and LEU2) and pRS316 (CEN, ampR, and URA3). Plasmid pRS423-FUS1-lacZ was described previously (34Hoffman G.A. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G.

Here we demonstrate that proteolytic processing regulates the biological activity of PlGF. Specifically, we show that plasmin processing of PlGF-2 yields a protease-resistant core fragment comprising the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 binding site but lacking the carboxyl-terminal domain encoding the heparin-binding domain and an 8-amino acid peptide encoded by exon 7. We have identified plasmin cleavage sites, generated a truncated PlGF118 isoform mimicking plasmin-processed PlGF, and explored its biological function in comparison with that of PlGF-1 and -2. The angiogenic responses induced by the diverse PlGF forms were distinct. Whereas PlGF-2 increased endothelial cell chemotaxis, vascular sprouting, and granulation tissue formation upon skin injury, these activities were abrogated following plasmin digestion.

https://openalex.org/W2045039385,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) plays key roles in normal brain development and function. Dysregulation of Cdk5 may cause neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Besides the well demonstrated role of Cdk5 in neurons, emerging evidence suggests the functional requirement of Cdk5 in oligodendroglia (OL) and CNS myelin development. However, whether neurons and OLs employ similar or distinct mechanisms to regulate Cdk5 activity remains elusive. We report here that in contrast to neurons that harbor high levels of two Cdk5 activators, p35 and p39, OLs express abundant p39 but negligible p35. In addition, p39 is selectively up-regulated in OLs during differentiation along with elevated Cdk5 activity, whereas p35 expression remains unaltered. Specific knockdown of p39 by siRNA significantly attenuates Cdk5 activity and OL differentiation without affecting p35. Finally, expression of p39, but not p35, is increased during myelin repair, and remyelination is impaired in p39(-/-) mice. Together, these results reveal that neurons and OLs harbor distinct preference of Cdk5 activators and demonstrate important functions of p39-dependent Cdk5 activation in OL differentiation during de novo myelin development and myelin repair."
https://openalex.org/W2094413657,"We have shown previously that estrogen (estradiol, E2) supplementation enhances voluntary alcohol consumption in ovariectomized female rodents and that increased alcohol consumption impairs ischemic hind limb vascular repair. However, the effect of E2-induced alcohol consumption on post-infarct myocardial repair and on the phenotypic/functional properties of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) is not known. Additionally, the molecular signaling of alcohol-estrogen interactions remains to be elucidated. This study examined the effect of E2-induced increases in ethanol consumption on post-infarct myocardial function/repair. Ovariectomized female mice, implanted with 17β-E2 or placebo pellets were given access to alcohol for 6 weeks and subjected to acute myocardial infarction. Left ventricular functions were consistently depressed in mice consuming ethanol compared with those receiving only E2. Alcohol-consuming mice also displayed significantly increased infarct size and reduced capillary density. Ethanol consumption also reduced E2-induced mobilization and homing of EPCs to injured myocardium compared with the E2-alone group. In vitro, exposure of EPCs to ethanol suppressed E2-induced proliferation, survival, and migration and markedly altered E2-induced estrogen receptor-dependent cell survival signaling and gene expression. Furthermore, ethanol-mediated suppression of EPC biology was endothelial nitric oxide synthase-dependent because endothelial nitric oxide synthase-null mice displayed an exaggerated response to post-acute myocardial infarction left ventricular functions. These data suggest that E2 modulation of alcohol consumption, and the ensuing EPC dysfunction, may negatively compete with the beneficial effects of estrogen on post-infarct myocardial repair."
https://openalex.org/W2115636098,"Arousal Biased Competition theory suggests that arousal enhances competitive attentional processes, but makes no strong claims about valence effects. Research suggests that the scope of enhanced attention depends on valence with negative arousal narrowing and positive arousal broadening attention. Attentional scope likely affects declarative-memory-mediated and perceptual-representation-mediated learning systems differently, with declarative-memory-mediated learning depending on narrow attention to develop targeted verbalizable rules, and perceptual-representation-mediated learning depending on broad attention to develop a perceptual representation. We hypothesize that negative arousal accentuates declarative-memory-mediated learning and attenuates perceptual-representation-mediated learning, while positive arousal reverses this pattern. Prototype learning provides an ideal test bed as dissociable declarative-memory and perceptual-representation systems mediate two-prototype (AB) and one-prototype (AN) prototype learning, respectively, and computational models are available that provide powerful insights on cognitive processing. As predicted, we found that negative arousal narrows attentional focus facilitating AB learning and impairing AN learning, while positive arousal broadens attentional focus facilitating AN learning and impairing AB learning."
