https://openalex.org/W2086262311,"The compound U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene) was identified as an inhibitor of AP-1 transactivation in a cell-based reporter assay. U0126 was also shown to inhibit endogenous promoters containing AP-1 response elements but did not affect genes lacking an AP-1 response element in their promoters. These effects of U0126 result from direct inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase family members, MEK-1 and MEK-2. Inhibition is selective for MEK-1 and -2, as U0126 shows little, if any, effect on the kinase activities of protein kinase C, Abl, Raf, MEKK, ERK, JNK, MKK-3, MKK-4/SEK, MKK-6, Cdk2, or Cdk4. Comparative kinetic analysis of U0126 and the MEK inhibitor PD098059 (Dudley, D. T., Pang, L., Decker, S. J., Bridges, A. J., and Saltiel, A. R. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A.92, 7686–7689) demonstrates that U0126 and PD098059 are noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to both MEK substrates, ATP and ERK. We further demonstrate that the two compounds bind to ΔN3-S218E/S222D MEK in a mutually exclusive fashion, suggesting that they may share a common or overlapping binding site(s). Quantitative evaluation of the steady state kinetics of MEK inhibition by these compounds reveals that U0126 has approximately 100-fold higher affinity for ΔN3-S218E/S222D MEK than does PD098059. We further tested the effects of these compounds on the activity of wild type MEK isolated after activation from stimulated cells. Surprisingly, we observe a significant diminution in affinity of both compounds for wild type MEK as compared with the ΔN3-S218E/S222D mutant enzyme. These results suggest that the affinity of both compounds is mediated by subtle conformational differences between the two activated MEK forms. The MEK affinity of U0126, its selectivity for MEK over other kinases, and its cellular efficacy suggest that this compound will serve as a powerful tool for in vitro and cellular investigations of mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated signal transduction.

Glucocorticoid hormones have been used clinically for over 40 years, and their pharmacological benefits, as well as detriments, have been extensively reviewed (1Baxter J.D. Pharmacol.

Mechanistically, glucocorticoids have been shown to act by binding to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GR). 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptors; GRE, glucocorticoid response element(s); MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAP kinase kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TRE, TPA response element; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FCS, fetal calf serum; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PHA, phytohemaglutinin; IL, interleukin; ATF, activating transcription factor; BSA, bovine serum albumin, CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. The glucocorticoid·GR complex once formed migrates to the nucleus and interacts with specific target sequences known as glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in gene promoters resulting in enhanced transcriptional activity. This feature of steroid hormone/receptor interaction is shared with a family of other hormones and effector molecules and their receptors which characterizes the steroid-thyroid receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors (6Gehring U. Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 399-402Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Fuller P.J. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3099-3902Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 385-839Google Scholar). Although steroids have diverse effects on metabolism, their clinical utility is derived from their potent anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory properties that result from inhibition of cytokine, adhesion molecule, and metalloproteinase gene expression (9Brattsand R. Linden M. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 10: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 10Schroen D.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cato A.C.B. Wade E. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The ability of steroid hormones to suppress transcription of key inflammatory and immune response genes is mediated through a mechanism distinct from GRE binding, however. Antagonism of the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB, which are important regulators of immune response genes, has been demonstrated in numerous laboratories and is proposed to be the primary mechanism for the anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive effects of steroids (11Cato A.C.B. Wade E. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This functional antagonism or transrepression of transcription factors by the GR is due to a direct protein/protein interaction between the activated GR and the components of the AP-1 and NF-κB complexes. These findings have led to the notion that the anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory properties of steroids might be due solely to protein/protein interactions between the GR and various transcription factors, whereas the side effects of steroid hormones may be mediated through classical GR/GRE interactions (12Herrlich P. Ponta H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 341-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Indeed, if this were the case, we envisioned that an agent that could selectively activate the GR to provide for functional antagonism of AP-1 and NF-κB without affecting GRE activation would be an ideal anti-inflammatory agent. Therefore, we set out to identify agents that could discriminate these GR activities using reporter gene assays in transfected cells. Herein, we report the results of these studies. Although we did not identify an agent that functionally antagonizes AP-1 gene transcription without affecting GRE transactivation through GR interaction, we did identify an agent that inhibited AP-1 independent of the GR. U0126 was identified as a cellular AP-1 antagonist. Mechanistically, U0126 did not prevent DNA binding by AP-1 rather it suppressed the up-regulation of c-Fos and c-Jun mRNA and protein levels in activated cells. Detailed investigation of the signaling cascades leading to c-Fos and c-Jun induction determined that U0126 was an inhibitor of the dual specificity kinase, MAP kinase kinase (MEK). This inhibition appeared to be selective as U0126 did not affect the kinase activity of protein kinase C, Abl, Raf, MEKK, ERK, JNK, MKK3, MKK6, Cdk2, or Cdk4. Another compound, PD098059, has recently been reported to also function as a selective inhibitor of MEK activity in vitro and in cellular assays (13Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7689-7868Crossref Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). In vitro steady state kinetic and equilibrium binding studies of both compounds with MEK reveal that their mode of inhibition is noncompetitive with respect to both substrates and that these two inhibitors share a common or overlapping binding site(s). Thus, both compounds are selective MAP kinase signaling cascade inhibitors and represent starting points for the identification and optimization of potent and pharmacologically useful MEK inhibitors. COS-7 cells were cultured at 5% CO2at 37 °C in DMEM:F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Labs, Inc.), 0.1 mm minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm minimum Eagle's medium sodium pyruvate solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and l-glutamine 500 mg/liter. The cells were trypsinized and washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without CaCl2 and MgCl2 and resuspended in Opti-MEM 1 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-7 cells (8 × 106 cells) were transiently transfected by the electroporation method (150 V, 500 microfarads, Bio-Rad electroporator) with either the AP-1 response element (2× TRE-luciferase) or the glucocorticoid response element (Pmam-neo-luciferase) plus human glucocorticoid receptor and RSV-β-galactosidase (provided by M. Karin, University of California, San Diego). Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, Life Technologies, Inc.) with and without 10 μm compound (in triplicate) in 1% final concentration dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (Sigma). The cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before harvesting for luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity. The cells were lysed (Lysis Buffer, 25 mm Tris-P04, pH 7.6, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, 15% glycerol) for 10 min at room temperature. Cell lysate (50 μl/well) was transferred to a 96-well luminometer plate (Microlite 2, Dynatech Laboratories, Inc.) to which 100 μl of luciferase substrate reagent was added (20 mmTricine, 2.7 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.1 mm MgCO3, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.27 mm coenzyme A, 0.47 mm luciferin, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 7.8). Luciferase activity was immediately determined using a Dynatech ML3000 luminometer. Chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) 22 μl/well was added to the remaining cell lysate, and β-galactosidase activity was determined after approximately 1 h at room temperature using a Molecular Devices UVmaxmicroplate kinetic reader at 570 nm. All AP-1 suppression data are expressed relative to the PMA control. All GRE activation is compared relative to dexamethasone. The effect of U0126 on a promoter containing multiple inducible elements was examined in transient transfection assays using a human renin promoter-luciferase reporter construct, RP5′-luc. RP5′-luc was constructed by subcloning a 1.2-kilobase pair fragment (−1245 to +36) of the human renin promoter 5′-untranslated region that contains both cAMP response elements and AP-1 response elements (TRE) (14Burt D.W. Nakamura N. Kelley P. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7357-7362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the NheI andBglII sites of pGL2-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) and was kindly provided by Dr. Gwen Wise (DuPont Merck). COS-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with 20 μg of RP5′-luciferase and 2 μg of human GR as described above. The transfected cells were plated in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 5% CO2, 37 °C before being treated with 10 ng/ml PMA or 1 mm N-6 2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3′,5′ cyclic monophosphate (Bucladesine; dibutyryl cyclic AMP, sodium salt) (Sigma) ± compound. After an additional 24-h incubation, the luciferase activity was measured as described above. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Labs, Inc.). Cells (1 × 107) were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA and 2 μg/ml PHA (phytohemaglutinin, Murex Biotech Ltd.) for 15 min at 37 °C. Drug-treated cells received U0126 at a final concentration of 10 μm in 0.1% Me2SO immediately prior to stimulation. Control cells received an equal amount of Me2SO. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (1× PBS, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)), and disrupted through a 21-gauge needle. Cellular debris was pelleted at 14,000 × g, and supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of the appropriate antibody (c-Raf-1(c-12), MEK-1(c-18), ERK-2(c-14) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) on a rocking platform at 4 °C. After 1 h, 40 μl of a protein-A agarose slurry was added, and tubes were rocked for another 2 h. Agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min, washed 3 times with RIPA buffer, and then once with 20 mmHepes, pH 7.0, buffer. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 25 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), containing 1 μg of His-MEK-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 5 μg of glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-(K71A)ERK-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., eluted from agarose beads with 10 mm glutathione), or 3 μg of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology) for Raf, MEK, and ERK kinase assays, respectively. Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μm ATP plus 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed on a 10% Tris glycine gel (Novex), dried, and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. COS-7 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes at 30,000 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Labs, Inc.). Cells were pretreated with compound in Me2SO (1% final concentration) for 15 min and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA for 15 additional min. Cells were washed once with cold PBS, lysed with cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm PMSF, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin), scraped from the plate, and centrifuged. Supernatants were assayed for protein using Bio-Rad DC-protein assay kit. Protein samples (20 μg) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% Tris-Tricine gels (Novex). Protein was electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with a polyclonal phosphospecific antibody against ERK (New England Biolabs). Detection of bands was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol and analyzed on Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer. For the experiments to determine the effects of U0126 on Fos and Jun protein expression, 3T3-type fibroblasts were plated in 100-mm dishes in DMEM, 10% FCS, and when they reached confluency were serum-starved for 72 h in DMEM, 0.5% FCS. The cultures were then stimulated with 50 ng/ml TPA, 10% FCS in the presence or absence of compound for various lengths of time. Compounds were added to give a final concentration of 0.1% Me2SO. At the end of the incubation period, nuclear extracts were prepared as follows. The cells were trypsinized, washed twice in cold PBS, and resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer 1 (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF). After 5 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer 2 (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF). The samples were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer 3 (250 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF). After three freeze/thaw cycles, the samples were centrifuged at 9,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was saved as the nuclear extract. Ten μg of this extract was analyzed by Western blot as described above using antibodies specific for c-Jun, c-Fos, and SP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). cDNA encoding a constitutively active form of MEK-1 (ΔN3-S218E/S222D) (N. Ahn, University of Colorado, Boulder) was recloned into pGEX-2T to express it as a GST fusion protein. Wild type forms of ERK1, p38, JNK1, and MKK-3 were cloned from a mixture of mRNA from human Jurkat, HeLa, and Raji cell lines by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Wild type MEK-2 was cloned by PCR from a cDNA clone (K. Guan, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). Wild type SEK-1 was cloned from a mixture of mRNA made by reverse transcriptase-PCR from EL4, 7023, and WEHI265 mouse cell lines. Wild type MKK-6 was cloned from human skeletal cDNA (CLONTECH). The catalytic domain of MEKK, consisting of amino acids 353–673, was cloned from mouse spleen cDNA (CLONTECH). A truncated form of c-Jun consisting of amino acids 1–108 was cloned from the full-length c-Jun cDNA. The wild type form of ATF-2 was cloned from fetal brain cDNA (CLONTECH). The primers used for the cloning described above were as follows: 5′MEK1, CGATGGATCCCCCAAGAAGAAGCCGACG; 3′MEK1, CGATCTCGAGTTAGACGCCAGCAGCATG; 5′MEK2, CGATGGATCCAACCTGGTGGACCTGCAG; 3′MEK2, CGATGAATTCTCACACGGCGGTGCGCGT; 5′ERK1, TTATGGATCCGCGGCGGCGGCGGCTCAG; 3′ERK1, CGATCTCGAGCTAGGGGGCCTCCAGCAC; 5′P38, CGATGGATCCTCTCAGGAGAGGCCCACGTTC; 3′P38, CGATCTCGAGTCAGGACTCCATCTCTTCTTG; 5′JNK1, CGATGGATCCAGCAGAAGCAAGCGTGAC; 3′JNK1, CGATCTCGAGTCACTGCTGCACCTGTGC; 5′MKK3, GCATCTCGAGTCCAAGCCACCCGCACCCAAC; 3′MKK3, GCATGAATTCCTATGAGTCTTCTCCCAGGATC; 5′SEK, TAATGGATCCGCGGCTCCGAGCCCGAGC; 3′SEK, CGATCTCGAGTCAGTCGACATACATGGG; 5′MKK6, GCATGGATCCTCTCAGTCGAAAGGCAAG; 3′MKK6, GCATCTCGAGTTAGTCTCCAAGAATCAG; 5′MEKK, CGATGGATCCATGGCGATGTCAGCGTCTCAG; 3′MEKK, CGATCTCGAGCTACCACGTGGTACGGAAGAC; 5′JUN, CGATGGATCCACTGCAAAGATGGAAACG; 3′JUN, CGATGAATTCTCACTCCTGCTCATCTGTCACGTTC; 5′ATF, CGATGGATCCAAATTCAAGTTACATGTGAATTCTGCC; 3′ATF,CGATCTCGAGTCAAAGAGGGGATAAATCTAGAGG. The following mutants were then generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR: kinase inactive ERK-1(K71A), constitutively active MEK-2(S222E/S226D), MKK-3(S189E/T193D), and MKK-6(S207E/T211E). All of the above cDNAs were cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL-21 cells and purified on glutathione beads according to the manufacturer's directions. The amount of immunoprecipitated wild type MEK used in these assays was adjusted to give a similar amount of activity units as obtained with 10 nm recombinant MEK (see below). All other assays were performed with a recombinant, constitutively activated mutant MEK-1 (ΔN3-S218E/S222D) or constitutively active MEK-2(S222E/S226D). Reaction velocities were measured using a 96-well nitrocellulose filter apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described below. Unless otherwise noted, reactions were carried out at an enzyme concentration of 10 nm, in 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4, at room temperature. Reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-33P]ATP into the premixed MEK/ERK/inhibitor reaction mixture, and an aliquot of 100 μl was taken every 6 min and transferred to the 96-well nitrocellulose membrane plate which had 50 mm EDTA to stop the reaction. The membrane plate was drawn and washed 4 times with buffer (see above) under vacuum. Wells were then filled with 30 μl of Microscint-20 (Packard, Meriden, CT) scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity of33P-phosphorylated ERK was counted with a Top Count (Packard, Meriden, CT) scintillation counter. Velocities were obtained from the slopes of radioactivity versus time plots. Concentrations of ERK and ATP were 400 nm and 40 μm, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. For MKK-3 and MKK-6, a coupled assay was used in which 200 nm MKK-3(S189E/T193D) or MKK-6(S207E/T211E) was preincubated with 100 nm wild type p38 in the presence of 20 μm cold ATP with or without U0126 for 15 min. The coupled reaction was then initiated with the addition of 3 μm myelin basic protein (for MKK-3) or ATF (for MKK-6) and 2 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP. For SEK, 700 nmMEKK, 143 nm SEK, 400 nm JNK, and 1 μm c-Jun were mixed with or without compound and initiated with 10 μm ATP and 1 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP. All reactions were carried out and analyzed as described for the immune complex kinase assays. The effect of U0126 on Abl kinase activity was determined by using baculovirus expressed c-Abl. Inhibition of c-Abl autophosphorylation was measured. Effects of U0126 on Cdk2 and Cdk4 were determined using recombinant proteins as described (15Carlson B.A. Dubay M.M. Sausville E.A. Brizuela L. Worland P.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2973-2978PubMed Google Scholar). For all of the in vitro enzyme assays, the percent inhibition was calculated 100 (1 −Vi/Vo) whereVi and Vo are the initial reaction velocities in the presence and absence of inhibitor, respectively. The data were then plotted as percent inhibition as a function of inhibitor concentration and fit, by nonlinear least squares regression, to the standard equation for a Langmuir isotherm to determine the IC50. As reported, enzyme concentrations were based upon molecular weights and mass of protein used in the final assay volume and not on active site titration. Thus, the actual enzyme active site concentration may differ from that reported. To determine whether U0126 and PD098059 could displace one another from MEK, we performed displacement experiments with 3H-labeled U0126 by equilibrium dialysis (16Bell J.E. Bell E.T. Proteins and Enzymes. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1988: 378-399Google Scholar). Dialysis was performed with a 10-kDa cut-off Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce). The cassette contained 0.5 ml of a 1 μm ΔN3-S218E/S222D MEK solution (in reaction buffer plus 400 μm ATP and 0.1 mg/ml BSA, see above). Mixtures were dialyzed at room temperature for 4 h against 100 ml of 0.2 μm [3H]U0126 and varying concentrations of PD098059, in the same buffer system. A dialysis time of 4 h was chosen because experiments in which [3H]U0126 was dialyzed against buffer only established that this amount of time was sufficient to reach equilibrium. At the end of dialysis the amount of [3H]U0126 inside and outside the dialysis cassette was quantified by scintillation counting. Control experiments were performed in the same fashion with BSA, but not MEK, present in the dialysis cassette. Only low levels of compound binding to BSA were detected, and the MEK data were corrected for this nonspecific binding. An immortalized 3T3-type cell line derived from mouse embryonic fibroblasts was used for these studies (17Hu E. Mueller E. Olivero S. Papaioannou V.E. Johnson R. Spiegelman B.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3094-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The cells were plated in 100-mm2 dishes in DMEM, 10% FCS and when they reached confluency were serum-starved for 48 h in DMEM, 0.5% FCS. The cultures were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml TPA, 10% FCS in the presence or absence of compound for 8 h. Compounds were added to give a final concentration of 0.1% Me2SO. Total RNA was isolated using RNA-ZolB(Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX), and Northern blots were performed as described (17Hu E. Mueller E. Olivero S. Papaioannou V.E. Johnson R. Spiegelman B.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3094-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) using 10 μg of RNA/lane. The blots were probed with digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probes for full-length murine MMP-1, c-Fos, c-Jun, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). For effects on IL-2 mRNA levels, Jurkat cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml PHA in the presence or absence of various concentrations of U0126. RNA was isolated after 4 h, and IL-2 mRNA levels were determined by Northern analysis using a digoxigenin-labeled human IL-2 cDNA as a probe. A 54-mer peptide (BBRC) containing a consensus sequence from the DNA binding region and leucine zipper dimerization motif of the Fos and Jun proteins was used. This peptide has been shown to bind to the TRE consensus site (19O'Neil K.T. Hoess R.H. Degrado W.F. Science. 1990; 249: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The sequence of the AP-1 binding oligonucleotide used was TTATAAAGCATGACTCAGACACCTCT, which contains the TRE site from the collagenase promoter. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase, purified over a Chromaspin-10 column (CLONTECH) to remove unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP, and annealed. For each reaction, 1 × 104 cpm (approximately 5 nm) of radiolabeled oligonucleotide was incubated with 15 nm BBRC peptide in a final volume of 25 μl of 1× binding buffer for 25 min at 16 °C. The binding buffer contained 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 12% glycerol, and 50 nm poly(dI-dC). Compounds were added to the peptide/binding buffer mixture 10 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide in a 0.4% final Me2SO concentration. All reactions were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 5% gels in 0.5× TBE buffer. FU5 BDS.1 rat hepatoma cells (20Cook P.W. Swanson K.T. Edwards C.P. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell.

After 24 h, compounds were added in Me2SO:media and incubated for an additional 24 h. The media were aspirated from the wells, and the cells were washed with PBS (without calcium and magnesium) before lysis with 25 μl/well 20 mm CHAPS in 0.1 mKHPO4 for 15 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min. Tyrosine aminotransferase activity was performed on the cell lysates as described (21Granner D.K. Tomkins G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 633-637Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar) with the following modifications to accommodate analysis in a 96-well plate format. Lysates (15 μl) were transferred to a 96-well plate to which 220 μl/well tyrosine aminotransferase reagent was added (150 mml-tyrosine in 0.2 mK2PO4, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.2 mm pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, pH 7.3). α-Ketoglutarate (0.5m in 0.2 m K2PO4, pH 7.3, 8 μl/well) was added to all wells except blanks and gently mixed. The plates were covered with foil and incubated at room temperature for 5 h. NaOH (10 n) was added to all wells (15 μl/well) except blanks and mixed thoroughly. α-Ketoglutarate (0.5 m in 0.2 mK2PO4, pH 7.3) was added to the blank wells (8.0 μl/well) and mixed. The tyrosine aminotransferase activity was measured at 340 nm using a Molecular Devices UVmax kinetic plate reader. U0124, U0125, and U0126 (22Middleton W.J. Engelhardt V.A. Fisher B.S. J. Am. Chem.

In a separate flaskortho-aminobenzenethiol (25 g, 20 mmol) was dissolved in 50 ml of degassed 10% sodium hydroxide. The tetracyanoethane solution was added in a single portion to the sodium hydroxide solution, and the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred for 2 h, during which time an oil separated. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand for 1 h, and the solid which formed was filtered.

In recent years, Staphylococcus epidermidis has emerged as a frequent cause of nosocomial infections in association with indwelling medical devices such as intravascular catheters, cerebrospinal fluid shunts, prosthetic heart valves, prosthetic joints, artificial pacemakers, and chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis catheters (reviewed in Refs. 1Christensen G.D.

C.1994: 45-78Google Scholar and 2Rupp M.E. Archer G.D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 19: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The virulence of S. epidermidis in these infections is thought to be based on its ability to colonize medical devices by forming a biofilm composed of multilayered cell clusters embedded in a slime matrix (3Ludwicka A. Uhlenbruck G. Peters G. Seng P.N. Gray E.D. Jeljaszewicz J. Pulverer G. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. Ser. A. 1984; 258: 256-267PubMed Google Scholar). As shown by electron microscopy studies, surface colonization takes place in two steps (4Peters G. Locci R. Pulverer G. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Abt. 1 Orig. B Hyg. Krankenhaushyg. Betriebshyg. Praev. Med. 1981; 172: 293-299Google Scholar). The first step is primary adhesion of some bacteria, which is followed by proliferation of the cells to multilayered clusters. Factors reported to contribute to primary attachment of S. epidermidis cells to a polymer surface include unspecific hydrophobic interactions (5Ludwicka A. Jansen B. Wadström T. Pulverer G. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. Ser. A. 1984; 256: 479-489PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pascual A. Fleer A. Westerdaal N.A.C. Verhoef J. Eur. J. Clin.

Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1013-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of the second phase of biofilm formation is intercellular adhesion, which results in the formation of large cell clusters by clinical S. epidermidis strains. This reaction is associated with the production of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) 1The abbreviations used are: PIA, polysaccharide intercellular adhesin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; HPTLC, high performance thin-layer chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. located at the cell surface (12Mack D. Nedelmann M. Krokotsch A. Schwarzkopf A. Heesemann J. Laufs R. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3244-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PIA consists of two structurally related homoglycans, polysaccharides I and II, composed of at least 130 2-deoxy-2-amino-d-glucopyranosyl residues that are mostly (>80%) N-acetylated. The residues are β-1,6-linked (13Mack D. Fischer W. Krokotsch A. Leopold K. Hartmann R. Egge H. Laufs R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), a type of linkage for N-acetylglucosamine polymers that has not been previously described. In addition, a 140-kDa extracellular protein that is missing in an accumulation-negative mutant of S. epidermidis RP62A is thought to contribute to intercellular adhesion (14Hussain M. Herrmann M. von Eiff C. Perdreau-Remington F. Peters G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 519-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schumacher-Perdreau F. Heilmann C. Peters G. Götz F. Pulverer G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 117: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, we cloned and sequenced three S. epidermidis RP62A genes (icaABC) that are involved in intercellular adhesion and PIA production (16Heilmann C. Schweitzer O. Gerke C. Vanittanakom N. Mack D. Götz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Transposon insertion mutants in theica operon of S. epidermidis O-47 (class B mutants) (17Heilmann C. Gerke C. Perdreau-Remington F. Götz F. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 277-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Heilmann C. Götz F. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. 1998; 287: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) are unable to form a biofilm on various surfaces. It has also been shown that the majority of S. epidermidisstrains isolated from septicemic patients were biofilm-positive, whereas skin and mucosal isolates were not, even though the genome of the biofilm-forming strains contained the ica genes (19Ziebuhr W. Heilmann C. Götz F. Meyer P. Wilms K. Straube E. Hacker J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 890-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report the identification of a fourth gene (icaD) that is located within the ica operon and that is necessary for PIA synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IcaA and IcaD are located in the membrane and together exhibitN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity, in which IcaA represents the catalytic enzyme that requires IcaD for full activity. Finally, we show that in addition to icaA andicaD, icaC is essential for long-chain PIA synthesis. DNA containingica was isolated from PIA-producing and biofilm-positiveS. epidermidis RP62A (ATCC 35984). The Staphylococcus carnosus wild-type strain TM300 (20Götz F. J. Appl. Bacteriol. Symp. Suppl. 1990; : 49-53Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was used as cloning host for all staphylococcal plasmids and for heterologous expression ofica genes. Cloning in Escherichia coli and the production of maltose-binding protein fusions were performed inE. coli strain TB1 (ara Δ(lac proAB)rpsL (f80 lacZΔM15) hsdR) obtained from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). Staphylococci were grown in tryptic soy broth (Difco, Augsburg, Germany) or in LB medium (1% Tryptone (Difco), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), and 0.5% NaCl), which was also used to cultivate E. coli. When appropriate, the media were supplemented with tetracycline (10 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml), or ampicillin (100 μg/ml). DNA manipulations, plasmid DNA isolation, and transformation of E. coli were performed using standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To isolate DNA from staphylococci, cells were lysed by adding 0.1 mg/ml lysostaphin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), and the alkaline lysis method was subsequently applied. Chromosomal staphylococcal DNA was prepared according to the procedure of Marmur (22Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). S. carnosus was transformed with plasmid DNA by protoplast transformation (23Götz F. Schumacher B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 40: 285-288Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction experiments were performed with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) as recommended by the manufacturer. DNA sequences were determined using the Sequenase protocol (Version 2.0, Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany) or a LI-COR DNA sequencer (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). The primers for polymerase chain reaction were as follows: primer 4, ATGCATGTATTTAACTTTTTACTTTTC; primer 5, TCGACGCGTGATATAGTAATAAATAAGCTCTCCC; primer 18, CGGGATCCAGGAGGTGAAAAAATGCATGTATTT; primer 23, TCGACGCGTTTGAAAGGTTTCATATGTCACG; primer 25, CGGGATCCAAGAAAGAAAGGTGGCTATGC; primer 33, GAAGATCTCATGGTCAAGCCCAGA; primer 34, GAAGATCTCATCAATGCGCTAATAAAG; primer S1, AAAAAGGCGCCGGGACTTTTTTTATTAATTCCAGTTAGGC; primer S2, TTTTTAGATCTCGCGTTTCAAAAATATAAGAAAGGTCGTG; primer S8, AATAAGGGACGCGTTTTATTAATTCCAG; primer S12, GCTTTAGATCTTAACTAACGAAAGGTAGG; and primer S15, CGATGATTATGACACAAATAAACACGCGTAAATACAC. Restriction sites are underlined. In this study, theica genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from chromosomal DNA of S. epidermidis RP62A and cloned independently or in various combinations in the inducible staphylococcal expression vectors pTX15 (24Peschel A. Götz F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 531-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pCX19, a derivative of pCX15 (25Wieland K.-P. Wieland B. Götz F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 158: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Gene expression was induced by adding 0.5% xylose (final concentration) to the growth medium (LB medium) atA 578 nm = 0.4 and further incubation of the strains for 6 h. The restriction sites used for the construction of the following plasmids are indicated in parentheses: pTXicaA carries icaA amplified using primers 18 and 5 (BamHI-MluI); pCXicaD containsicaD amplified using primers 25 and 23 (BamHI-SmaI); pTXicaAD harborsicaA and icaD amplified using primers 18 and 23 (BamHI-MluI); pTXicaADBC contains the entire ica operon amplified using primers S12 and S8 (BglII-MluI); pTXicaADB carriesicaA, icaD, and icaB amplified using primers S12 and S15 (BglII-MluI); and pTXicaBC contains icaB and icaCamplified using primers S2 and S1 (BglII-NarI). pTXicaADC was obtained by generating a frameshift deletion mutation of icaB in pTXicaADBC as described for the inactivation of icaB in pCN27 (16Heilmann C. Schweitzer O. Gerke C. Vanittanakom N. Mack D. Götz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). The plasmid pTX16 (24Peschel A. Götz F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 531-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a negative control. Fusions of icaA and icaD with malEwere constructed using the vector pIH902 (New England Biolabs), a derivative of pMAL-c2. The icaA gene was amplified using primers 4 and 5, cleaved with AccI, treated with Klenow enzyme, and inserted into the StuI site of pIH902, yielding the plasmid pIHicaA300, encoding the first 306 amino acids of IcaA. pIHicaD carries icaD amplified using primers 33 and 34 and blunt end-inserted into the StuI site of pIH902. Staphylococcus and E. colicultures were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm dithiothreitol; 2 μl/mg of cell wet weight). The cells were disrupted by 3 × 1-min vortexing in Corex tubes with glass beads (diameter of 0.15–0.30 mm; 4.5 times the weight of the cell pellet). DNase I (20 μg/ml; Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) was added before breaking the cells. Unbroken cells and glass beads were sedimented (10 min, 2000 × g), and the supernatant was saved. The procedure was repeated one to three times; all supernatants were combined. Membranes were sedimented from the crude extract by ultracentrifugation (20 min, 200,000 × g) and resuspended in buffer A at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml (5-fold concentration of the membrane proteins over the crude extract). The collected membranes were called “crude membranes.” For further purification, the crude membranes were extracted with 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 (in buffer A) for 2 h with gentle shaking, sedimented again, washed once with buffer A, and resuspended in the same volume of buffer A as the crude membranes. These preparations were designated “Triton-extracted membranes.” The membranes were stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). E. coli TB1 carrying pIHicaA300 or pIHicaD was used to express the malE gene fusions. The soluble maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein MBP-IcaA300 was purified according to Ref. 45New England BiolabsProtein Fusion and Purification System Manual. New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany1990Google Scholar. The very poorly produced fusion protein MBP-IcaD was located in the membrane fraction, from where it was solubilized as described above using 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 500 mmNaCl. The MBP-IcaD-containing fraction was diluted to a final Triton X-100 concentration of 0.5% and incubated for 12 h with amylose resin equilibrated with column buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The amylose material was collected by centrifugation (10 min, 2000 × g) and washed. MBP-IcaD was eluted with 10 mm maltose in column buffer. Rabbits were immunized with the purified MBP fusion proteins at Eurogentech (Seraing, Belgium) according to their standard immunization program. The antiserum obtained against MBP-IcaA300 was designated anti-IcaA; the antiserum obtained against MBP-IcaD was designated anti-IcaD. To block unspecific binding of the antisera and secondary conjugates used in immunoblot analyses, these were diluted 1:250 in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm sodium azide and incubated with a crude extract from S. carnosus pTX16 (final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml). After 12 h of gentle shaking, precipitated material was sedimented by centrifugation (30 min, 30,000 × g). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma) or electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BA83, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) using a semidry apparatus. IcaA was detected by the anti-IcaA antiserum and IcaD by the anti-IcaD antiserum (1:1000). Subsequently, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit immunglobulin G-biotin conjugate (1:5000; Sigma) and with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex (1:5000; Amersham). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) with Fuji HR-E30 films. Reprobing of a blot with another primary antiserum was performed according to the ECL Western blotting protocol. PIA production in vivo was analyzed in crude extracts and in cell-surface extracts obtained by incubating the cells in 0.5m EDTA, pH 8.0, for 5 min at 100 °C. For production experiments in the presence of antibiotics, tunicamycin (5–20 μg/ml) and bacitracin (50–400 μg/ml) were added to cultures of S. carnosus pTXicaADBC at the time of induction. PIA production in vitro was determined in the enzymatic assays. Extracts (1 μl each) were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane (BA83) using the Bio-Dot Microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad, München, Germany). PIA was detected with the PIA-specific antiserum (1:5000) (16Heilmann C. Schweitzer O. Gerke C. Vanittanakom N. Mack D. Götz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Bound PIA antibodies were visualized by anti-rabbit immunglobulin G-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:5000; Sigma) and color reaction. In vitro reactions to analyze glycosyltransferase activity were performed by incubating crude extracts (see above) with 0.4 mm UDP-N-acetylglucosamine or crude membranes or Triton-extracted membranes (see above) with 2 mm UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. In vitrosynthesis of peptidoglycan was repressed by adding 50 μg/mld-cycloserine (26Lugtenberg E.J.J. de Haas-Menger L. Ruyters W.H.M. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 326-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For radiolabeling, 10 μmUDP-N-acetyl-d-[U-14C]glucosamine (final radioactive concentration of 84 Bq (2.3 nCi)/μl of reaction volume; Amersham) was added. Analytical reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10–50 μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 12 h at 20 °C. To test other substrates, UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, and UDP-glucuronic acid (14C-labeled substrates from Amersham) were used in equimolar amounts. For experiments in the presence of tunicamycin and bacitracin, the antibiotics were added in the above-mentioned concentrations. For thin-layer chromatography, in each case, 1 μl of in vitro reaction assays containing14C-labeled UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was applied to NH2-HPTLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The chromatogram was developed twice using acetonitrile/water (60:40 or 65:35, v/v). Radioactive spots were detected by phosphoimaging with a Fuji BAS 1500 (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) or by autoradiography. Fuji HR-E30 films were exposed for 6–10 weeks. As a reference compound,N-acetyl-d-[1-14C]glucosamine (25 Bq) or unlabeled N-acetylglucosamine (10 μg) was used. If appropriate, 0.005% Triton X-100 was added. The unlabeled standard was visualized by spraying with 0.2% orcinol in H2SO4 and subsequent heating at 100 °C for 15 min. For HPLC analysis of the in vitro synthesized products, the pH of the reaction assays was lowered to 4.5 with phosphoric acid; the samples were heated for 5 min at 100 °C; and the precipitated material was sedimented by centrifugation (10 min, 13,000 ×g). Acetonitrile was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 75%. The products were separated on a Nucleosil 120-7-NH2-HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm; Bischoff, Leonberg, Germany) and eluted with an acetonitrile gradient in pure water from 75 to 50% acetonitrile over 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Subsequently, the column was washed for 10 min with pure water. Elution was monitored by determining A 205 nm. Radiolabeled products were detected by measuring 14C using a flow counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Electrospray mass spectra were recorded on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer Model API III (mass range of m/z 10–2400) equipped with a pneumatic supplied electrospray (“ion spray”) interface (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode under unit mass resolution conditions for all determinations. The potential of the spray needle was kept at 4.8 kV; the orifice voltage was +80 V. For mass calibration, a solution of polypropylene glycol was used. Unlabeled IcaAD-dependent products synthesized in vitro were applied to the mass spectrometer by HPLC/MS coupling injecting 100 μl/min into the mass spectrometer. To analyze the biosynthesis of the N-acetylglucosamine polymer PIA, theica genes were expressed under the control of the xylose-inducible promoter of the pTX15 expression vector (24Peschel A. Götz F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 531-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) independently and in various combinations in S. carnosus. Glycosyltransferase activity was studied by incubating crude extracts or cell fractions of these clones with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, the putative substrate forN-acetylglucosamine oligomer synthesis. In these experiments, evident transferase activity was detected whenicaA and the intergenic region between icaA andicaB were expressed in S. carnosus. This region harbors a small open reading frame whose relevance was, until then, unclear. The gene was designated icaD (Fig. 1). The icaD gene is 306 nucleotides long and is transcribed in the same direction as the icaABC genes. The start oficaD overlaps with the end of icaA by 37 nucleotides (Fig. 1), and the end of icaD overlaps with the start of icaB by 4 nucleotides. The deduced polypeptide oficaD consists of 101 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 11,953 Da and a pI of 9.88. IcaD contains 54.5% hydrophobic amino acids, and two transmembrane helices are predicted. Similarity searches in data bases revealed no sequence similarity of IcaD to known proteins. Inactivation of icaD in a plasmid containing the complete ica operon led to the loss of cell aggregation and PIA production in S. carnosus (data not shown), indicating that, in addition to icaABC, icaD plays an essential role in intercellular adhesion and PIA production in vivo. To determine the localization of IcaA and IcaD, antisera against maltose-binding protein fusions of IcaA and IcaD were raised in rabbits. By Western blot analyses, the presence of IcaA and IcaD was analyzed in various cell fractions from induced S. carnosus pTXicaAD cells. For detailed studies, the membrane fraction was divided into crude membranes (membranes derived from the crude extract by ultracentrifugation) and Triton-extracted membranes (crude membranes purified by Triton X-100 extraction). The anti-IcaA antiserum reacted with a 38-kDa protein present in the crude extract, the crude membranes, and the Triton-extracted membranes, but not with any protein in the cytosolic fraction or the soluble fraction obtained from Triton X-100 extraction (Fig. 2 A). No reaction of the antiserum was observed with Triton-extracted membranes from uninducedS. carnosus pTXicaAD or from S. carnosus pTX16 (24Peschel A. Götz F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 531-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying the vector alone, indicating that the reaction of the antiserum was IcaA-specific. The IcaD-specific antiserum reacted with a 34-kDa protein that was present in the same fractions as IcaA (Fig. 2 B). Thus, both IcaA and IcaD are membrane-bound. IcaA and IcaD exhibited very similar apparent molecular masses in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses. We therefore reprobed the blot that was analyzed with the IcaD-specific antiserum with the anti-IcaA antiserum to confirm that IcaA and IcaD are independent proteins. The result (Fig. 2 C) clearly showed that the two antisera recognize different proteins. The glycosyltransferase activity of IcaAD was analyzed in crude extracts and membranes from S. carnosus pTXicaAD. As a negative control, extracts from S. carnosus pTX16 were used. Products synthesized in vitro from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (5–25% of the applied substrate was 14C-labeled) were analyzed by HPTLC on NH2-HPTLC plates (Fig. 3). With crude extract, crude membranes, and Triton-extracted membranes from induced S. carnosus pTXicaAD, but not with the cytosolic fraction or the soluble fraction obtained from Triton X-100 extraction, radiolabeled products were formed that were separated in a ladder-like series. This ladder strongly suggested that the products represent oligomers with an increasing number of residues. No such products were synthesized with extracts from S. carnosus pTX16 cells (Fig. 3) or extracts from uninduced S. carnosus pTXicaAD cells (data not shown), indicating that the observed transferase activity was due to icaA andicaD. When UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, and UDP-glucuronic acid, which often function as substrates for the biosynthesis of exopolymers, were tested, we obtained no ladder of products (data not shown). The migration rates of the products synthesized with crude membranes and Triton-extracted membranes were different. Since the migration rate of the reference compound N-acetylglucosamine differed as well after addition of Triton X-100 (0.005%, w/v), as indicated in Fig. 3, the deviation is probably due to the Triton X-100 remaining in the Triton-extracted membrane preparation. These data were supported by mass spectrometric analyses, in which the oligomers synthesized with Triton-extracted membranes were found to be associated with Triton X-100 molecules (data not shown). The mass spectrometric analyses were performed to further characterize the in vitro synthesized reaction products. For these analyses, the products were separated by HPLC. The elution profile of the IcaAD-dependent products from Triton-extracted membranes, recorded by analyzing 10 μl of radiolabeled assay mixtures, is shown in Fig. 4. HPLC separation was performed on an NH2-HPLC column using an acetonitrile gradient. The HPLC separation system was comparable to the NH2-HPTLC system. By isolating the eluted compounds and analyzing them again by HPTLC, we found that the succession of the eluted IcaAD-dependent products was the same in HPLC and HPTLC analyses (data not shown). The numbers of the spots in the high performance thin-layer chromatogram (Fig. 3) and the peaks in the high performance liquid chromatogram (Fig. 4) correspond to identical substances. In the electrospray mass spectrometric analyses of nonradioactive products synthesized with Triton-extracted membranes, spectra of the substances eluting as peaks 1–8 were recorded. They revealed molecular ions at m/z 204, 407, 610, 813, 1016, 1219, 1422, and 1625 (Fig. 4). These values correspond to the [M + H]+pseudo-molecular ions of a monomer to octamer ofN-acetylglucosamine lacking one water residue/sugar chain since the displayed ions were 18 mass units smaller than the calculated [M + H]+ pseudo-molecular ions of the fully hydratedN-acetylglucosamine monomer to octamer (m/z 222, 425, 628, 831, 1034, 1237, 1440, and 1643). The mass spectrometric analyses of the products synthesized with crude membranes revealed that different kinds of oligomers were formed with this membrane preparation and that the TLC and HPLC systems used were not capable of separating all of the formed products. In the analyses of the products M2, M4, M6, and M8–12 (Fig. 3), ions were obtained that corresponded to two different N-acetylglucosamine oligomers. The ions at m/z 204, 407, 610, 813, 1016, 1219, 1422, and 1625 represent the [M + H]+ pseudo-molecular ions of the putative anhydrous monomer to octamer ofN-acetylglucosamine that were also formed with Triton-extracted membranes; the ions at m/z 222, 425, 628, 831, 1034, 1237, 1440, and 1643 correspond to the fully hydratedN-acetylglucosamine monomer to octamer. The ladder of these products is indicated in Figs. 3 and 6. The ion of product M1 was detected at m/z 325, and in substances M3–9, additional ions at m/z 528, 731, 934, 1137, 1340, 1543, and 1746 were detected. These ions probably represent the [M + H]+pseudo-molecular ions of the monomer to octamer ofN-acetylglucosamine carrying a modification with a mass of 103. None of the MS analyses of the in vitro products from crude membranes and Triton-extracted membranes revealed deacetylatedN-acetylglucosamine residues, which compose 15–20% of the major polysaccharide I of PIA (13Mack D. Fischer W. Krokotsch A. Leopold K. Hartmann R. Egge H. Laufs R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Bacterial exopolysaccharides are often synthesized on an undecaprenyl phosphate lipid carrier (27Bugg T.D.H. Brandish P.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether a lipid carrier is involved in the synthesis of the IcaAD metabolites. Attempts to isolate lipid-linked intermediates in vitro or in vivo according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) failed. Furthermore, the antibiotics tunicamycin and bacitracin, which affect undecaprenyl phosphate-mediated syntheses, had no effect on eitherin vitro oligomer synthesis or in vivo PIA production (data not s"

The receptor tyrosine kinase family of cell surface proteins is known to play key roles in transducing intercellular signals to the cytoplasm (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). A large diversity of receptor tyrosine kinases and receptor tyrosine kinase expression patterns, which are temporally modified during development and under pathologic conditions, determines cell fate and allows tissue-specific cell responses. Ligand binding to the large extracellular domain of receptor tyrosine kinases leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain of the receptor (2Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). A variety of Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, which are recruited to these phosphorylation sites, have been identified (3Marschall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). These proteins are regarded as initiators of different signal cascades that finally lead to specific cellular responses including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and morphologic organization in the context of surrounding tissues (4Risau W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence similarity and structural characteristics, it is possible to classify receptor tyrosine kinases into subfamilies (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). Two receptor tyrosine kinase subfamilies are characterized by their largely endothelium-specific expression. One of them consists of the three known vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 1VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; EC, endothelial cell; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; NT-3, neurotrophin 3; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SMC, smooth muscle cells; Ang, angiopoietin; HM, human microvascular; MTS, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CM, conditioned media; rTie1-Fc, Tie1 receptor-Fc. receptors Flt-1/VEGF-R1, Flk-1/KDR/VEGF-R2, and Flt-4/VEGF-R3 (5Mustonen T.

The critical role of these receptors in promoting vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during normal embryogenesis was demonstrated using mutant mice with targeted disruption of the flt-1 (7Fong G-H.

Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of these receptors in the endothelial layer of adult blood vessels (9Couffinhal T.

The Tie (tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin (Ig) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) homology domains) receptor family comprises a second endothelial-specific subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases termed Tie1 (16Dumont D.J.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1897-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) display a lethal phenotype caused by severe defects in embryonic vasculature. Moreover, an activating mutation in the Tie2 receptor was shown to cause inherited venous malformations in humans (25Vikkula M. Boon L.M. Carraway III, K.L. Calvert J.T. Diamonti A.J. Goumnerov B. Pasyk K.A. Marchuk D.A. Warman M.L. Cantley L.C. Mulliken J.B. Olsen B.R.

Although the ligands of the three VEGF receptors, their binding patterns, and their functions are relatively well characterized (5Mustonen T. Alitalo K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 6Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), the ligand for the Tie2 receptor, named angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), was only recently isolated (27Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar), whereas the ligand(s) for the Tie1 receptors are still unknown. Targeted disruption of the Ang1 gene in mice resulted in an embryonic lethal phenotype by day 12.5 with generalized defects in vascular structure reminiscent of those previously observed in mice lacking Tie2 (28Suri C. Jones P.F. Patan S. Bartunkova S. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Sato T. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). Ang1 protein phosphorylated Tie2 receptor in a variety of ECs but did not induce EC growth or tube formation (27Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). In fact, no in vitro assay to date has demonstrated any biological function of Ang1 for ECs. Analysis of Ang1 mRNA expression in adult tissues revealed abundant expression in highly vascularized tissues such as skeletal muscle, prostate, ovary, uterus, and placenta (29Maisonpierre P. Suri C. Jones P. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T. Papadopoulos N. Daly T. Davis S. Sato T. Yancopoulos G. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2975) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of Ang1 not only in embryonic angiogenesis but also in the adult vasculature. Given the paucity of in vitro data, however, the physiologic contribution of Ang1 to these processes remains enigmatic. The temporal appearance of embryonic Ang1 expression suggests that the Ang1/Tie2 system is not involved in the initial vasculogenic phase of vascular development (as shown for the VEGF system) but rather participates in angiogenic outgrowth (sprouts), vessel remodeling, and vascular maturation (22Sato T.N. Tozawa Y. Deutsch U. Wolburg-Buchholz K. Fujiwara Y. Gentron-Maguire M. Gridley T. Wolburg H. Risau W. Qin Y. Nature. 1995; 376: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar, 24Dumont D.J.

Gertsenstein M. Wu X-F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of a natural antagonist for Tie2, named angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), that binds to Tie2 but does not transduce the receptor has added a further level of complexity to regulation by the Ang/Tie2 system (29Maisonpierre P. Suri C. Jones P. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T. Papadopoulos N. Daly T. Davis S. Sato T. Yancopoulos G. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2975) Google Scholar). Findings described in the current study are the first to our knowledge to demonstrate an in vitro effect of Ang1 on ECs. We show that Ang1, but not Ang2, is a potent and specific chemotactic protein when administered to ECs. Neither Ang1 nor Ang2 was found to be mitogenic for ECs. In contrast to other angiogenic cytokines (30Haimovitz-Friedman A. Balaban N. McLoughlin M. Ehleiter D. Michaeli J. Vlodavsky I. Fuks Z. Cancer Res. 1994; 115: 245-247Google Scholar, 31Spyridopoulos I. Brogi E. Kearney M. Sullivan A.B. Cetrulo C. Isner J.M. Losordo D.W. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1321-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), both Ang1 and Ang2 were also devoid of anti- or pro-apoptotic effects. The chemotactic response of ECs toward Ang1 could be abolished by excess soluble Tie2, but not Tie1 receptor, as well as by increasing amounts of Ang2. In contrast to findings shown for Ang2 and ECs, fibroblasts stably transfected with Tie2 receptor exhibited strong chemotactic responses for Ang2 as well as Ang 1, consistent with previous observations that Ang2 can activate Tie2 receptors in non-ECs. Finally, the demonstration of Tie2 as well as Ang1 expression in adult normal arterial and venous specimens suggests a potential role for Tie2/Ang1 in the maintenance of vascular integrity. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from umbilical cord vein by collagenase treatment as described previously (32Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin.

HUVECs were used between passages 3 and 5. Human microvascular (HM) ECs of dermal origin were purchased from Clonetics, grown in EBM medium containing human epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (10 ng/ml), 5% FBS, and 0.4% bovine brain extract (Clonetics). Human microvascular endothelial cells were used between passages 4 and 6. Rat vascular smooth muscle cells were extracted from rats as described previously (33Mader S.L. J. Gerontol. Biol.

Human vascular smooth muscle cells were derived by explant outgrowth from unused portions of saphenous veins obtained at coronary bypass surgery as described previously (34Pickering J.G. Weir L.

NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in 10% FBS. Stable transfections of fibroblasts with an expression plasmid encoding full-length Tie2 receptor cDNA, a chimeric receptor consisting of the ectodomain of TrkC fused to the cytoplasmic domain of Tie2 or with empty vector (mock), were produced as before (29Maisonpierre P.

The purity of proteins was greater than 95% as judged by reducing and nonreducing silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Soluble Tie1 receptor-Fc (rTie1-Fc) and Tie2 receptor-Fc (rTie2-Fc) fusion proteins were constructed, produced, and purified as described recently (27Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A.

Heterodimeric recombinant human VEGF165 protein purified from Escherichia coli was a generous gift of Drs. N. Ferrara, B. Keyt, and S. Bunting at Genentech Inc. Cell proliferation was assayed using the colorimetric MTS (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium) assay with the electron coupling reagent phenazine methosulfate (CellTiter 96 AQ, Promega). This assay was previously validated and demonstrated to positively correlate with cell number (35Buttke T.M. McCubrey J.A. Owen T.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 30: 233-240Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in a fibronectin-coated 96-well plate (5 × 103cells/well) in 0.1 ml of serum-supplemented medium and allowed to attach overnight. Factors in 5% FBS were added to the wells for 48 h as indicated. MTS/phenazine methosulfate mixture (20 μl) was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37 °C before measuring absorbance at 490 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Background absorbance from control wells was subtracted, and seven wells were performed in parallel for each condition. EC DNA synthesis was evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. A total of 2 × 104 cells/well in M199 containing 5% FBS were seeded in 24-well plates, coated with 1.5% gelatin, and allowed to attach overnight. Specific conditions (see below) were employed for 48 h before the addition of 2 μl/ml [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 4 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, lysed in 0.25 n NaOH, and then transferred into glass vials filled with scintillation liquid. Radioactivity was measured in a Beckman counter and expressed as counts/min (cpm). The addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) was used as a positive control to induce [3H]thymidine incorporation. Each sample was done in triplicate. To quantify apoptosis, floating and adhesive cells were collected after treatment as indicated using trypsin and washed and resuspended in ice-cold 70% ethanol. For cell cycle analysis, only adhesive cells were considered. After fixing overnight at 4 °C, cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Boehringer Mannheim) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml RNase A (50 units/l, Sigma) at 4 °C for at least 1 h. DNA content was analyzed from 1 × 105 events/group using a fluorescent-activated cell sorter Scan cytometer (Becton Dickinson) with Lysys II software. Cells with less fluorescence intensity than the G1 peak were regarded as apoptotic and expressed as a percentage of total number of cells analyzed. Cell cycle statistics were calculated using CellFit Cell-Cycle software (Becton Dickinson). EC migration assays were performed using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe) (36Falk W. Goodwin R.H. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 8 μm (Nuclepore) were coated with 50 μg/ml fibronectin and 0.1% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline for at least 6 h at room temperature and dried under sterile air. Test substances were diluted to appropriate concentrations in M199 supplemented with 1% FBS, and 25 μl of the final dilution was placed in the lower chamber of a modified Boyden chamber. Confluent cell cultures were washed and trypsinized for the minimum time required to achieve cell detachment. After placing the filter between lower and upper chambers, 2.5 × 105 cells suspended in 50 μl of M199 containing 1% FBS were seeded in the upper compartment. The apparatus was then incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2 to allow cell migration. After the incubation period, the filter was removed, and the upper side of the filter containing the nonmigrated cells was scraped with a rubber policeman. The filters were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa solution (Diff-Quick, Baxter). Migration was quantified by counting cells in three random high power fields (100×) in each well. All groups were studied in quadruplicate. Unused segments of human internal mammary artery, radial artery, and saphenous vein were obtained during bypass surgery, as described previously (9Couffinhal T. Kearney M. Witzenbichler B. Chen D. Murohara T. Losordo D.W. Symes J.F. Isner J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1673-1685PubMed Google Scholar); these specimens were retrieved from the operating room at the time of excision and were promptly processed to avoid degradation of RNA. Care was taken to remove these segments in a nontraumatic manner, including limiting manipulation of the specimens to the ends of the vascular segments. Total RNA from these specimen or from cell cultures as indicated was immediately isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and RNA concentration was calculated from absorbance at 260 nm. Reverse transcription (RT) (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 204-210Google Scholar) was performed by heating a 10 μl reaction mixture containing 1 μg of total RNA and 20 μg/ml oligodeoxythymidine (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 70 °C for 10 min. After cooling, 60 units of human placenta ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega) and 200 units of Moloney's murine leukemia virus RNase H reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added in a final 20-μl reaction mixture containing 1 mmol/l each dNTP (Amersham), 10 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 25 mmol/l Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mmol/l KCl, and 3mmol/l MgCl2, incubated for 1 h at 42 °C, heated 5 min at 95 °C, and diluted to 50 μl with double-distilled water. For the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (39Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.G. Ehrlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar), a 50-μl reaction containing 5 μl of cDNA-RNA hybrids, 200 μmol/l dNTP (Amersham), 20 mmol/l Tris-HCl, pH 8.55, 2.5 mmol/l MgCl2,16 mmol/l (NH4)2SO4, 150 μg/ml BSA, 1 μmol/l each oligonucleotide primer, and 1.25 units ofTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) was subjected to the following temperature cycles: 30 s of denaturing at 95 °C, 5 s of annealing at 56 °C, and 1 min of extension at 72 °C. At the end of the last cycle, a prolonged extension step was carried out for 10 min. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoreses of 10 μl of each PCR reaction mixture in a 1.5% agarose gel, and bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Experiments were repeated ≥ triplicate. The primers chosen for sense (3′-5′) and antisense (5′-3′), respectively, were: for human Tie2 (GenBankTM accession number L06139) ATCCCATTTGCAAAGCTTCTGGCTGGC and TGTGAAGCGTCTCACAGGTCCAGGATG (512 base pairs of PCR product); for human Ang1 (GenBankTM accession number U83508) GGGGGAGGYYGGACTGTAAT and AGGGCACATTTGCACATACA (362 base pairs); for human Ang2 (GenBankTM accession number AF004227) GGATCTGGGGAGAGAGGAAC and CTCTGCACCGAGTCATCGTA (535 base pairs); and for human GAPDH (GenBankTM accession number X01677) TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTG and CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC (983 base pairs). The number of cycles was 40 for Tie2, Ang1, and Ang2 and 28 for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. RT-PCR was performed in each case using exactly the same amount of RNA. PCR was always performed in parallel for each primer pair and the PCR products were separated on the same gel. The linear range of amplification was tested for all primer pairs by performing PCR with an increasing number of cycles. PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed as an internal control, demonstrating comparable starting amounts of cDNA for all extracts. Expression in human ECs of the angiopoietins, VEGF, Tie1, and Tie2 was examined on RNA blots. RNAs were isolated from low passage- number HUVECs, aorta (human aortic ECs), dermal microvasculature (all purchased from Clonetics, San Diego, CA), and cutaneous fat pad microvasculature (a gift from Dr. J. Springhorn, Alexion Pharmaceuticals) endothelial cells. The cells were grown on tissue culture plastic using recommended basal medium, 5% FBS, and supplements (Clonetics) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. To harvest RNAs, media was removed from confluent cultures, and the cell monolayer was briefly rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline then lysed with guanidinium thiocyanate and processed as described (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were resolved by electrophoresis on replicate formaldehyde-agarose gels, blotted to nylon membranes, and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes. As a control, the blots also included poly(A) + RNAs from human placenta and lung (from CLONTECH). The Ang1, Ang2, Tie1, and Tie2 probes were radiolabeled inserts from human cDNAs; the VEGF probe was the entire insert of a mouse VEGF164cDNA. 2P. Maisonpierre, unpublished data. HUVEC expression of Ang2 RNAs led us to ask whether these cells secrete Ang2 protein into the culture medium. Conditioned media (CM) was collected from HUVEC cultures as follows. The medium from established HUVEC cultures was replaced with serum-free defined medium and grown for 24 h, whereupon the cells were refed with fresh-defined medium. After an additional 24 h of cell growth, this HUVEC-CM was harvested, concentrated 10-fold by filtration (Amicon, 10,000 MWCO), and then assayed for the presence of Tie2 binding activities on a Tie2-Fc-coupled BIAcore sensor chip (Amersham), as described previously (27Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). HUVEC-CM contained 190 resonance units of Tie2-specific binding activity or roughly a 10-fold greater signal than that seen with CM from angiopoietin-negative cell media (data not shown). To distinguish whether this Tie2 binding activity was Ang2 protein, the HUVEC-CM was further concentrated to 50× (Centricon, 3000 MWCO), fractionated on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and then analyzed by immunodetection with antisera specific to Ang1 and Ang2. Results were expressed as mean ±S.E. of the mean. Statistical significance was evaluated using unpaired Student's t test for comparisons between two means and ANOVA followed by Scheffe's procedure for more than two means. A value of p < 0.05 was interpreted as statistically significant. To evaluate cellular proliferation in response to Ang1* or Ang2, we stimulated HUVECs with increasing amounts of Ang1*, Ang2, or VEGF, a known EC-specific mitogen, for 48 h and performed MTS analysis. This assay was previously shown to accurately reflect cell number (35Buttke T.M. McCubrey J.A. Owen T.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 30: 233-240Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). VEGF treatment led to a significant dose-dependent increase in optical density, positively correlating with an increase in absolute cell number; a half-maximal response was between 1 and 10 ng/ml. In contrast, neither stimulation with Ang1* nor Ang2 over a wide dose range led to a significant increase in cell number (data not shown). In addition, the influence of Ang1* and -2 on DNA synthesis in HUVECs was evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorpo"
https://openalex.org/W1977236952,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) play an integral role in modifying insulin-like growth factor actions in a wide variety of cell types. Recent evidence suggests that IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 also have effects on cell growth that are insulin-like growth factor-independent. In investigating possible mechanisms for this effect, the intracellular trafficking of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5, both of which contain sequences with the potential for nuclear localization, was studied in T47D cells. Nuclear uptake of fluorescently labeled IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 was observed in a proportion of T47D cells that appeared to be rapidly dividing. IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2, which do not possess the putative domain for nuclear translocation, were not transported to the nuclei of T47D cells. When T47D cells were preincubated with excess unlabeled IGFBP-3, nuclear localization of labeled IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-5 was not detected, indicating that their nuclear translocation involves a common pathway. Inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis did not affect nuclear uptake of IGFBP-3, suggesting that it uses an alternative non-classical import pathway for transport across the plasma membrane. In addition, a variant form of IGFBP-3 with a mutation in the putative nuclear localization sequence was unable to translocate to the nuclei of T47D cells, suggesting that nuclear translocation of IGFBP-3 was dependent on these carboxyl-terminal basic residues."
https://openalex.org/W2004142844,"The acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) gene, which has been implicated in ceramide-mediated cell signaling and atherogenesis, gives rise to both lysosomal SMase (L-SMase), which is reportedly cation-independent, and secretory SMase (S-SMase), which is fully or partially dependent on Zn2+ for enzymatic activity. Herein we present evidence for a model to explain how a single mRNA gives rise to two forms of SMase with different cellular trafficking and apparent differences in Zn2+ dependence. First, we show that both S-SMase and L-SMase, which contain several highly conserved zinc-binding motifs, are directly activated by zinc. In addition, SMase assayed from a lysosome-rich fraction of Chinese hamster ovary cells was found to be partially zinc-dependent, suggesting that intact lysosomes from these cells contain subsaturating levels of Zn2+. Analysis of Asn-linked oligosaccharides and of N-terminal amino acid sequence indicated that S-SMase arises by trafficking through the Golgi secretory pathway, not by cellular release of L-SMase during trafficking to lysosomes or after delivery to lysosomes. Most importantly, when Zn2+-dependent S-SMase was incubated with SMase-negative cells, the enzyme was internalized, trafficked to lysosomes, and became zinc-independent. We conclude that L-SMase is exposed to cellular Zn2+ during trafficking to lysosomes, in lysosomes, and/or during cell homogenization. In contrast, the pathway targeting S-SMase to secretion appears to be relatively sequestered from cellular pools of Zn2+; thus S-SMase requires exogeneous Zn2+ for full activity. This model provides important information for understanding the enzymology and regulation of L- and S-SMase and for exploring possible roles of ASM gene products in cell signaling and atherogenesis.

Two other types of mammalian SMases are lysosomal SMase (L-SMase) and secretory SMase (S-SMase), both of which arise from the “acid SMase” or “ASM” gene (15Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T.

Both enzymes are soluble hydrolases that function optimally at acid pH in a standard in vitro micellar assay (16Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol.

Both L- and S-SMase are absent from the cells of patients with types A and B Niemann-Pick disease, which is due to mutations in the ASM gene, and from the cells of ASM knock-out mice (16Schissel S.L.

S-SMase may have significant physiologic roles, since extracellular SM hydrolysis may be involved in some or all of the non-lysosomal processes listed above. For example, several lines of evidence have implicated extracellular SM hydrolysis in atherogenesis. First, treatment of LDL with SMase in vitro leads to LDL aggregation (10Xu X. Tabas I. J. Biol.

Second, aggregated LDL from human and animal atherosclerotic lesions shows evidence of hydrolysis by extracellular SMase, and LDL retained in rabbit aortic strips ex vivo is hydrolyzed by an extracellular, cation-dependent SMase (12Schissel S.L.

In addition, antibodies made against L-SMase recognize S-SMase, demonstrating that the common mRNA is translated in the same reading frame, and the molecular weights of the enzymes on Western blot are similar (see Ref. 16Schissel S.L.

In fact, the lack of stimulation of L-SMase by any cations and its lack of inhibition by EDTA has led to a long-standing body of literature labeling L-SMase as a “cation-independent” enzyme (1Levade T. Salvayre R. Blazy-Douste L. J. Clin. Chem. Biochem. 1986; 24: 205-220PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the widespread interest in mammalian SMases in general and in products of the ASM gene in particular, little is known about cellular itineraries of L-SMase and S-SMase or about the mechanism for their apparent difference in zinc dependence. For example, does S-SMase arise by release or exocytosis of L-SMase from lysosomes or by a separate trafficking pathway, and how could two enzymes that are so similar differ in their requirement for zinc? In this report, we show that S-SMase is secreted through a non-lysosomal secretory pathway, and we present evidence that both forms of the enzyme are zinc-activated. According to our model, L-SMase is exposed to cellular Zn2+during trafficking to lysosomes, in lysosomes, and/or during cell homogenization. Most likely, the Zn2+ dependence of L-SMase has been overlooked because it is already saturated with Zn2+ upon isolation from cell homogenates and thus does not respond to exogenous Zn2+ at the time of assay. Furthermore, as is the case with known zinc metalloenzymes (cf. Ref. 36Little C. Otnass A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 391: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the Zn2+ cannot be stripped from L-SMase by simple exposure to EDTA. In contrast, the pathway targeting S-SMase to secretion appears to be relatively sequestered from cellular pools of Zn2+. Thus, this enzyme requires Zn2+during subsequent in vitro assay. The information in this report should prove useful for future studies that explore the enzymology, regulation, and functions of these important SMases.

CHO-K1 cells were grown in Hams' F-12 containing 10% HI-FBS and PSG. CHO cells stably transfected with ASM cDNA 3X. He, S. R. P. Miranda, A. Dagan, S. Gatt, and E. H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 35-mm (6-well) or 100-mm dishes in media containing HI-FBS for 48 h. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated for 24 h in fresh serum-free media (1 and 6 ml per 35-mm and 100-mm dishes, respectively) containing 0.2% BSA. This 24-h conditioned medium was collected for SMase assays. Following the incubations described above and in the figure legends, cells were placed on ice, and the serum-free conditioned media were removed. The cells were washed two times with ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose and scraped into 0.3 and 3.0 ml of this sucrose solution per 35- and 100-mm dishes, respectively. Unless indicated otherwise, the scraped cells were disrupted by sonication on ice using three 5-s bursts (Branson 450 Sonifier), and the cellular homogenates were assayed for total protein by the method of Lowry et al. (42Merrill A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and for SMase activity as described below. The conditioned media were spun at 800 × g for 5 min to pellet any contaminating cells and concentrated 6-fold using a Centriprep 30 (Amicon; Beverly, MA) concentrator (molecular weight cut-off = 30,000). For the experiment in Fig. 5, CHO-K1 cells were incubated in 100-mm dishes in serum-free media and washed as described above. Cells were then scraped in 5 ml of 0.25 m sucrose and broken open under 500 p.s.i. of nitrogen pressure for 1.5 min using a nitrogen cell disruption bomb (Parr Instruments, Moline, IL). Following disruption, a portion of the cells was subjected to brief sonication as described above; this portion of cells is referred to as the cell homogenate. The remainder of disrupted cells was spun at 1300 × g for 5 min to pellet any remaining intact cells and nuclei. This post-nuclear supernatant was collected, and the volume was increased to 15 ml with 0.25 m sucrose and then spun at 16,000 ×g for 30 min. The pellet from this centrifugation was resuspended in 1 ml of 0.25 m sucrose and sonicated as above, and this material, as well as the cell homogenate, was assayed for SMase activity. As described previously (16Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), the standard 200-μl assay mixture consisted of up to 40 μl of sample (conditioned media or homogenized cells; see above) and a volume of assay buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0) to bring the volume to 160 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 40 μl of substrate (50 pmol of [3H]sphingomyelin) in 0.25m sucrose containing 3% Triton X-100 (final concentration of Triton X-100 in the 200-μl assay mix = 0.6%). When added, the final concentrations of EDTA and Zn2+ were 5 and 0.1 mm, respectively, unless indicated otherwise. The assay mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for no longer than 3 h and then extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (43Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar); the lower, organic phase was harvested, evaporated under N2, and fractionated by TLC using chloroform/methanol (95:5). The ceramide spots were scraped and directly counted to quantify [3H]ceramide. Typically, our assay reactions contained approximately 20 μg of cellular homogenate protein and a volume of conditioned media derived from a quantity of cells equivalent to approximately 50 μg of cellular protein. Protein samples were boiled in buffer containing 1% SDS and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min, loaded onto 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoresed for 50 min at 35 mA in buffer containing 0.1% SDS (SDS-PAGE). Following electrophoresis, some gels were fixed in methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (5:2:3, v/v) and then silver-stained using reagents from Bio-Rad. Other gels were electrotransferred (100 V for 1.5 h) to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. For immunoblotting, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk in buffer A (24 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.5m NaCl) for 3 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with rabbit anti-FLAG-tagged S-SMase polyclonal antiserum (1:2000) in buffer B (buffer A containing 0.1% Tween 20, 3% nonfat dry milk, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing four times with buffer A containing 0.1% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) for 1 h in buffer B at room temperature. The membranes were subsequently washed twice with 0.3% Tween 20 in buffer A and twice with 0.1% Tween 20 in buffer A. Finally, the blots were soaked in the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products) for 2 min and exposed to x-ray film for 1 min. We followed the procedure described by Hurwitz et al. (44Hurwitz R. Ferlinz K. Vielhaber G. Moczall H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5440-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were incubated overnight with serum-free medium (CHO-S-SFM II from Life Technologies, Inc.). Fifty μg of 30-fold-concentrated conditioned medium and 50 μg of cell homogenate were diluted 1:1 (v/v) with 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 2% SDS and 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (44Hurwitz R. Ferlinz K. Vielhaber G. Moczall H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5440-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One set of aliquots of the diluted conditioned medium and cell homogenate was treated for 16 h at 37 °C with 4 milliunits of endo H. Another set of aliquots was diluted another 15-fold with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and treated for 16 h at 37 °C with 100 milliunits of peptide-N-glycanase F. The endo H digest and a trichloroacetic acid pellet of the peptide-N-glycanase F digest (44Hurwitz R. Ferlinz K. Vielhaber G. Moczall H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5440-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were boiled in SDS/dithiothreitol buffer and then electrophoresed and immunoblotted as described above. We used a modification of the method of Hortin and Gibson (45Hortin G.L. Gibson B.L. Prep. Biochem. 1989; 19: 49-59PubMed Google Scholar). Packed 1-ml columns of chelating Sepharose 6B (iminodiacetic acid coupled to agarose gel via a hydrophilic spacer; from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were washed with 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10 mm EDTA, to leave the column uncharged, or containing 60 mm ZnCl2, to charge the column with Zn2+. The columns were then equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl. One-ml samples of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of this equilibration buffer and unconcentrated conditioned medium from ASM-transfected CHO cells (above) were loaded onto the columns and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The columns were then washed with 7.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing either 100 mm NaCl or 1 m NaCl, which was collected as 10 0.75-ml fractions. The columns were eluted with 3.75 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm EDTA plus 1 mm1,10-phenanthroline, which was collected as 5 0.75-ml fractions. Aliquots of each of the fractions were spotted on nitrocellulose using a slot-blot apparatus and then immunoblotted using goat anti-human L-SMase polyclonal antiserum as described above. Unless otherwise indicated, results are given as means ± S.D. (n = 3); absent error bars in the figures signify S.D. values smaller than the graphic symbols. We sought to address how L- and S-SMase acquire their apparent differences in zinc dependence. One explanation would be that the secreted form requires a Zn2+-dependent cofactor. Because many lysosomal enzymes undergo proteolytic activation (46Hasilik A. Experientia ( Basel ). 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), an obvious candidate for a Zn2+-dependent cofactor would be a zinc metalloproteinase. Five sets of results, however, ruled out this possibility. First, Zn2+-activated S-SMase can be subsequently inactivated by Zn2+ chelation (see below); reversibility of Zn2+-induced activation is not consistent with proteolytic activation. Second, inhibitors of zinc metalloproteinases, such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) (47Nagase H. Suzuki K. Itoh Y. Kan C.C. Gehring M.R. Huang W. Brew K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 389: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and two different thiol-based peptide inhibitors, HS-CH2-R-CH(CH2-CH(CH3)2)-C)-Phe-Ala-NH2and HO-NH-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)-C)-naphthyl-Ala-NH-CH2-CH2-NH2(48Panchenko M.V.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7113-7119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), did not affect the ability of Zn2+ to activate S-SMase (data not shown). Third, mammalian zinc metalloproteinases require Ca2+ as well as Zn2+ for activity (49Reynolds J.J. Oral Diseases. 1996; 2: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), whereas Ca2+ is not a requirement for the activation of S-SMase (16Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Fourth, comparison of Zn2+-activated S-SMase from CHO cells with that of the intracellular (lysosomal) enzyme by immunoblot analysis showed that the activated secreted form had a somewhat higher, not lower, apparent molecular weight (see control data in Fig. 3, below); in addition, S-SMase not activated with Zn2+ had the same apparent molecular weight as Zn2+-activated S-SMase (data not shown). Fifth, we found that highly purified S-SMase, obtained by either anti-FLAG immunoaffinity purification of a FLAG-tagged S-SMase or by concanavalin A chromatography followed by anti-SMase immunoaffinity purification of S-SMase from ASM-transfected CHO cells (16Schissel S.L.

It mediates the immunosuppressive actions of drugs such as cyclosporin and FK506, and has been implicated in a number of calcium-sensitive pathways in the nervous system, including regulation of neurotransmitter release and modulation of long-term changes in synaptic plasticity. Calcineurin associates physiologically with other proteins, including calmodulin, FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein), the ryanodine receptor, and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. We now report the identification, molecular cloning, and functional characterization of a novel protein, cain (calcineurininhibitor), that interacts with and inhibits calcineurin. The full-length cain cDNA predicts a 240-kDa protein with no significant homology to any known protein. Cain associates with calcineurin both in vitro and in vivo, leading to a non-competitive inhibition of calcineurin activity. The putative calcineurin-binding domain of cain, a 38-amino acid region defined by mutational analysis, is highly basic. Like calcineurin, cain has a prominent neuronal expression and a wide tissue distribution. Cain's expression pattern in the brain closely resembles that of calcineurin, indicating a physiologic association between the two proteins.

By inhibiting calcineurin activity, cyclosporin A and FK506 prevent the nuclear translocation of NF-AT secondary to dephosphorylation, thereby suppressing T cell activation (14Rao A. Luo C.

Although it is expressed in many tissues, calcineurin is most concentrated in neuronal systems, and comprises over 1% of total protein in brain (2Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol.

Calcineurin has diverse roles in the nervous system, where it participates in many calcium-regulated pathways. Dynamin I, whose GTPase activity regulates synaptic vesicle recycling (16De Camilli P.

Calcineurin modulates the GTPase activity of dynamin I by altering its phosphorylation state, thereby regulating the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate (18Nichols R.A. Suplick G.R.

Science. 1995; 267: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Elevation of intracellular calcium concentration following opening of the NMDA receptor channel activates several downstream proteins including neuronal nitric oxide synthase, which influences neuronal cell death secondary to glutamate NMDA neurotoxicity (23Dawson V.L.

Science. 1992; 258: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The activity of nitric oxide synthase is diminished by phosphorylation so that dephosphorylation and subsequent activation of nitric oxide synthase by calcineurin implicates this phosphatase in NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity (25Dawson T.M.

Besides mediating glutamate neurotoxicity, NMDA receptors influence synaptic plasticity. A role for protein kinases in shaping synaptic plasticity is well established (26Roberson E.D. English J.D.

Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 31Lu Y.F. Hayashi Y. Moriwaki A. Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Neurosci.

Recently, Winder and colleagues (33Winder D.G. Mansuy I.M. Osman M. Moallem T.M. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1998; 92: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) discovered that calcineurin inhibits a novel, intermediate phase of long-term potentiation, which influences the transition from short-term to long-term memory (34Mansuy I.M. Mayford M. Jacob B. Kandel E.R. Bach M.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Despite the abundance of calcineurin and its role in many biologically important processes, few endogenous regulators of calcineurin have been identified. Calmodulin, bound to CnA, enhances its activity, while the autoinhibitory domain of CnA competitively inhibits the phosphatase activity (35Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase prevents the in vivoinactivation of calcineurin secondary to oxidative damage (36Wang X. Culotta V.C. Klee C.B. Nature. 1996; 383: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), but there is no evidence for direct binding between the two proteins. FKBP12 associates with calcineurin, even in the absence of immunosuppressive drugs (37Cardenas M.E. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This interaction involves residues distinct from those mediating the FK506-dependent association of FKBP12 and calcineurin, and allows FKBP12 to function as a calcineurin anchoring protein. FKBP12 targets calcineurin to intracellular calcium channels such as the ryanodine receptor (38Jayaraman T. Brillantes A.M. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Marks A.R. J.

Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Calcineurin activity regulates the calcium flux through these channels secondary to changes in their phosphorylation states (42Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Another well known anchoring protein for calcineurin is AKAP79 (Akinase anchoring protein), a scaffolding protein that also binds cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C (43Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Physical association between calcineurin and AKAP79 leads to inhibition of calcineurin activity, as well as its targeting to neuronal membranes (44Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the above short list of proteins could adequately explain the diversity of calcineurin function. To better appreciate the role of calcineurin in multiple calcium-sensitive signaling pathways, we sought additional regulatory molecules for this unique phosphatase. We now report the identification and characterization of cain (calcineurin inhibitor), a novel, large protein that physiologically interacts with calcineurin and potently inhibits its catalytic activity. FK506 was a gift from Dr. Joseph Steiner (Guilford Pharmaceutical). Glutathione-Sepharose and calmodulin-Sepharose beads were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech. Purified human FKBP12, purified bovine calcineurin, the RII peptide (calcineurin substrate), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase were purchased from Sigma. Anti-CnA antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories, and anti-CnB antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. The rabbit polyclonal anti-cain antibody was raised against (His)6-cain (described below), and affinity-purified using the immunogen as described (45Sharp A.H. McPherson P.S. Dawson T.M. Aoki C. Campbell K.P. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3051-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CnA was subcloned into SalI andNotI sites of pPC86/97 (46Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) from the full-length human calcineurin Aβ open reading frame, using the following polymerase chain reaction primers: 5′-acgcgtcgaccatggccgccccggag-3′ and 5′-ttttgcggccgctcactgggcagtatggtt-3′. Cain deletion mutants were generated from the cain fragment obtained from the two-hybrid screen using the following polymerase chain reaction primers and an appropriate vector primer: cain1518–1610, 5′-ttttgcggccgccaggtgatggcagcagcc-3′; cain1518–1683, 5′-ttttgcggccgcgcctccactggccagcag-3′; cain1518–1752, 5′-ttttgcggccgcgtaggtggtgtgacggtg-3′; cain1762–1810, 5′-acgcgtcgaccagcatctcagaggagac-3′; cain1715–1810, 5′-acgcgtcgactcaaggcaaaactgagtc-3′. Inserts were then digested with SalI and NotI and cloned into corresponding sites in pPC86 and pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. The full-length human FKBP12 open reading frame was cloned into yeast expression vector pPC97, containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. This was used to screen a rat hippocampal cDNA library cloned into pPC86 (47Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), containing the GAL4 transactivation domain. The plasmids were introduced sequencially by LiAc-mediated transformation into FKBP12-deficient HF7C yeast strain, constructed as described (48Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). A total of 1.5 × 106independent clones were screened, and positive interacting proteins were identified by selecting for His+ growth phenotype with a strict dependence on the presence of FK506. Positive clones were further evaluated for β-galactosidase expression by nitrocellulose filter lift assays as described (46Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were prepared according to manufacturer's recommendations (Pharmacia Biotech) and coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. (His)6-cain construct was generated by subcloning the cain fragment isolated from the two-hybrid screen into the SalI and NotI sites of pET-28c(+) vector (Novagen). The fusion protein was prepared as per the manufacturer's protocol. In each binding assay, 2 μg of purified (His)6-cain and/or 2 μg of purified bovine calcineurin were added to 20 μl of the GST-fusion protein-Sepharose slurry (50% (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline) and brought to a final volume of 200 μl with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). After binding was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle mixing, the samples were washed three times with binding buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with anti-T7 antibody (Novagen) at 1:10,000 dilution and anti-CnB antibody at 1:1,000 dilution, followed by a 1:5,000 dilution of anti-mouse Ig antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Western blots were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham). The two-hybrid cain fragment was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector with a cytomegalovirus promoter and an in-frame N-terminalmyc epitope tag. This myc-cain construct was introduced into HEK293 cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h following transfection and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of cell lysate were incubated with GST-Sepharose, GST-FKBP12-Sepharose, or calmodulin-Sepharose beads (20 μl of 50% slurry) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Where indicated, GST-FKBP12-Sepharose beads were preabsorbed with FK506 for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed twice in lysis buffer prior to adding to the cell lysate. FK506 was also added to the cell lysate in co-precipitation assays as indicated. Following the incubation, the Sepharose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described above. The anti-myc antibody was used at 1:3,000 dilution, and anti-CnA antibody at 1:250 dilution. Adult rat brain was homogenized in lysis buffer (described above) and spun at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble materials. The resulting lysate was divided into equal aliquots and incubated with GST-FKBP12-Sepharose beads in the same manner described above. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described. An adult rat brain cDNA library in λZAPII vector (Stratagene) was screened using the two-hybrid cain fragment, labeled with 32P in a nick translation system (Boehringer Mannheim). A 5.4-kilobase open reading frame was identified, and a probe from the N-terminal sequence (nucleotides 41–1040) was generated for a second screen. A total of 4.0 × 106 clones were screened, yielding 33 overlapping inserts. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using Marathon-Ready rat brain cDNA (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer's protocol. The assay was carried out as described by Hubbard and Klee (49Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Wheal H. Chad J. Molecular Neurobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 135-137Google Scholar) unless otherwise indicated. A peptide corresponding to the phosphorylation site on the RII subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was phosphorylated and used as substrate. Assays were performed in 50-μl aliquots containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 nm calmodulin, and 25 nm bovine calcineurin (Sigma). After 1 h preincubation with (His)6-cain at 4 °C, reactions were started by the addition of 2–150 μm substrate peptide. Assays were performed at 25 °C for 8 min and terminated by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid in 0.1 m KH2PO4. A commercial rat multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized according to the manufacturer's recommendations with the N-terminal cain probe described above. Tissues from an adult male rat were harvested and homogenized in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline + 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Each homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min and the pellet discarded. Equal amounts (40 μg of proteins) from all samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using affinity-purified polyclonal anti-cain antibody, followed by anti-rabbit Ig at 1:5,000 dilution and detected with ECL reagents. RNA probes for FKBP12, CnA, and cain were generated by subcloning each open reading frame from pPC86 or pPC97 into the SalI and NotI sites of pBS(SK)II+ (Stratagene). Brain slices for in situ hybridization were prepared and probed as described (50Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8074-8082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In initial experiments we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that selectively bind FKBP12 in the presence of the drug FK506. We screened a rat hippocampal cDNA library and identified a 300-amino acid protein fragment without homology to any known protein sequence. This fragment constitutes the C-terminal portion of cain (calcineurininhibitor). In the yeast two-hybrid analysis, wild-type HF7c and FKBP12-deficient HF7c yeast strains were used to assay protein interactions based upon the activation of two reporters, β-galactosidase expression and the more sensitive histidine prototrophy. In yeast containing endogenous FKBP12 (wild-type HF7c), we detected a weak interaction between FKBP12 and CnA in the presence of 1 μm FK506 (HIS3+, β-gal−) (Table I,rows 1 and 2). We reasoned that the endogenous yeast FKBP12 may compete with the human FKBP12 bait protein in the two-hybrid system; accordingly, we assayed the interaction between FKBP12 and CnA in the FKBP12-deficient yeast and observed a strong interaction (HIS3+, β-gal+) (Table I,rows 3 and 4).Table ISummary of yeast two-hybrid resultsProtein in pPC86Protein in pPC97Endogenous yeast FKBP12Presence of FK506 (1 μm)Activation of HIS3 reporterActivation of β-galactosidase reporter1FKBP12Calcineurin A+−−−2FKBP12Calcineurin A+++−3FKBP12Calcineurin A−−−−4FKBP12Calcineurin A−+++5CainFKBP12−−−−6CainFKBP12−++−7Cainp70S6K−−−−8Cainp70S6K−+−−9CainCalcineurin A+−++10CainCalcineurin A++++11CainCalcineurin A−−++12CainCalcineurin A−+++pPC97 contains the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and pPC86 contains the GAL4 transactivation domain. The control plasmid pPC97-p70S6K was generated by subcloning a fragment of p70S6K, corresponding to amino acids 332 to 504, into the SalI and NotI sites of pPC97. Open table in a new tab pPC97 contains the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, and pPC86 contains the GAL4 transactivation domain. The control plasmid pPC97-p70S6K was generated by subcloning a fragment of p70S6K, corresponding to amino acids 332 to 504, into the SalI and NotI sites of pPC97. Using the FKBP12-deficient yeast, we found that cain interacted with FKBP12 only in the presence of FK506 (Table I, rows 5–8). However, the weakness of this interaction (HIS3+, β-gal−) suggested that the association between cain and FKBP12/FK506 may be mediated by a third protein. Since calcineurin binds tightly to FKBP12 in the presence of FK506, proteins that associate with calcineurin as substrates or regulators may indirectly interact with FKBP12/FK506. Using CnA as the bait protein in the two-hybrid system, we found a robust interaction (HIS3+, β-gal+) with cain (Table I, rows 9–12). The strength of this interaction was unaltered in the absence of FK506 and endogenous FKBP12, indicating a direct association between calcineurin and cain. Experiments utilizing purified proteins substantiate a direct interaction between cain and calcineurin. Affinity purified (His)6-cain fragment bound GST-FKBP12/FK506 resin only in the presence of calcineurin, establishing that there is no direct interaction between cain and FKBP12 (Fig. 1 A). This conclusion is supported by binding experiments utilizing GST-cain affinity resin and purified calcineurin. The direct association between calcineurin and cain was unaltered by the addition of FK506 and FKBP12 (Fig. 1 B). To ascertain whether the interaction between cain and calcineurin takes place in intact mammalian cells, we utilized HEK293 cells transfected with myc-cain (Fig. 2 A). We monitored co-precipitation of myc-cain and the endogenous calcineurin onto a GST-FKBP12/FK506 affinity resin. Both myc-cain and calcineurin bound the resin only in the presence of FK506. The interaction between calmodulin and calcineurin also allows for purification of calcineurin by a calmodulin affinity resin. Using this resin, we evaluated the ability of myc-cain to co-purify with calcineurin (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of calmodulin-Sepharose but not GST-Sepharose, both myc-cain and calcineurin bound the calmodulin resin in a FK506-independent manner. We next examined whether cain and calcineurin associate physiologically in tissues. Using adult rat brain homogenate, we bound endogenous calcineurin onto GST-FKBP12/FK506 affinity resin and looked for co-precipitating cain proteins using an anti-cain antibody. The amount of incubation time was minimized in order to detect association of endogenous proteins, not secondary associations that occur after lysis. We found that cain and calcineurin co-precipitated onto GST-FKBP12 columns in the presence of FK506, and that the amount of precipitated cain varied in accordance with the amount of bound calcineurin (Fig. 2 C). The association between cain and calcineurin could also be detected similarly in liver tissue (data not shown). In addition, this experiment revealed that the endogenous cain protein has an apparent molecular mass of 230 kDa (more details below). Utilizing nucleotide probes derived from the cain sequence, we screened a rat brain cDNA library and obtained 33 overlapping clones. A 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction yielded no additional upstream sequence (data not shown). The full-length cDNA of cain assembled from overlapping clones contains 7272 nucleotides. The starting methionine was assigned to the first in-frame AUG codon (nucleotide 332). This AUG is preceded by two in-frame stop codons and exists in the context of a Kozak translation initiation consensus (51Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). The 6.5-kilobase open reading frame codes for a protein of 2182 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 243 kDa (Fig. 3). A search of sequence data bases revealed no significant homology with any previously characterized protein. To ascertain the region of cain that interacts with calcineurin, we generated different deletion mutants by truncating the 900-base fragment detected in the initial yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 4 A). Utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system, we found two overlapping deletion mutants of cain that retain the ability to interact with calcineurin (Fig. 4 A). This was verified by in vitro binding studies using purified calcineurin and cain deletion mutants coupled to GST-Sepharose beads (Fig. 4 B). These analyses indicate that all of the calcineurin binding activity of cain can be ascribed to a 38-amino acid region near the C terminus (Fig. 4 A). This sequence is notable in that the calculated pI for this 38-amino acid fragment is 10.3, while that of the full-length is 5.7. To evaluate influences of cain on calcineurin catalytic activity, we assayed calcineurin activity in the presence of purified (His)6-cain. Cain potently inhibited calcineurin activityin vitro with half-maximal inhibition evident at about 0.4–0.5 μm and a calculated Ki value of 0.44 μm (Fig. 5 A). A Dixon plot indicates that the inhibition is non-competitive (Fig. 5 B). To investigate the possibility that the inhibition of calcineurin activity by cain may be explained by its binding to calmodulin, we performed our inhibition studies in the presence of varying concentrations of calmodulin. We found that the inhibition of calcineurin by cain is independent of calmodulin concentration. Even in the presence of a 50-fold increase in calmodulin concentration, the inhibition curve was essentially unaltered (Fig. 5 C). Using Northern analysis, we detected a 7.5-kilobase transcript of cain enriched in brain, kidney, and testis but which also can be detected in all other tissues examined (Fig. 6 A). This size transcript is consistent with our predicted full-length cDNA. In addition, a smaller and less abundant transcript, possibly resulting from alternative splicing, can be detected in all tissues examined. Western analysis using affinity purified polyclonal anti-cain antibody revealed a discrete band at approximately 230 kDa. The mobility of this band on SDS-PAGE is consistent with the predicted molecular weight of full-length cain. Several smaller immunoreactive species were also prominent in cerebellum and liver, possibly representing tissue-specific isoforms or proteolytic fragments of the full-length protein. All of these bands were eliminated by pre-absorbing the antibody with (His)6-cain (data not shown). Protein expression matched closely the mRNA levels suggested by Northern analysis, particularly in regard to the low abundance of cain in skeletal muscle and heart (Fig. 6 B). Subcellular fractionation experiments indicate that cain is predominantly cytosolic (data not shown). Calcineurin and FKBP12 share highly similar distribution patterns in the brain, supporting a functional interaction between these two proteins (52Dawson T.M. Steiner J.P. Lyons W.E. Fotuhi M. Blue M. Snyder S.H. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization of cain, calcineurin, and FKBP12, revealed a striking similarity between cain and calcineurin expression (Fig. 7 A). Both display low expression in the brainstem, but are prominent in the olfactory bulb, caudate, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, zona reticulata of the substantia nigra, and all layers of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. The co-localization of cain and calcineurin transcripts appears even greater than that of FKBP12 and calcineurin. In the olfactory epithelium, where FKBP12 is virtually undetectable, both cain and calcineurin are present in great abundance (Fig. 7 B). FKBP12 is localized predominantly to cerebellar Purkinje cells and not to granule cells. While cain and calcineurin are both enriched in granule cells, calcineurin also occurs in Purkinje cells (Fig. 7 C). In the present study we have identified a novel protein, cain, which physiologically interacts with and inhibits calcineurin. Multiple experimental paradigms including the yeast two-hybrid system and several binding studies reveal that the interaction occurs bothin vitro and in vivo. We also detected physiologic association of cain and calcineurin in both brain and liver tissues. Perhaps the most impressive evidence establishing a physiologic link between cain and calcineurin is their strikingly similar localizations in the brain, where both proteins occur exclusively in neurons. Previously, we reported a close similarity between localizations of calcineurin and FBKP12 in the brain, supporting a physiological relationship between the two proteins (52Dawson T.M. Steiner J.P. Lyons W.E. Fotuhi M. Blue M. Snyder S.H. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).In situ hybridization reveals an even greater similarity between cain and calcineurin expression than that between calcineurin and FKBP12. Cain inhibits calcineurin with a Ki value of about 0.4 μm, and appears to be the most potent known endogenous inhibitor of calcineurin. AKAP79, a well established calcineurin inhibitor, is about 0.2% as potent in this regard (44Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The autoinhibitory peptide of calcineurin itself has aKi value of 10–50 μm (35Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the inhibitory action of cain is exerted upon CnA or CnB is unclear. In our experiments we observe binding of cain to both CnA and CnB. However, the two calcineurin subunits are so tightly associated that it is not unexpected that they would bind as a complex. Cain binds to calcineurin at location(s) distinct from the FKBP12/FK506-binding sites, as multiple experiments showed that the association between cain and calcineurin is unaltered by the addition of FKBP12/FK506. FKBP12/FK506 sterically blocks access to the substrate-binding site of calcineurin, thereby inhibiting calcineurin activity (53Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Gastinel L.N. Habuka N. Chen X. Maldonado F. Barker J.E. Bacquet R. Villafranca J.E.

Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). The binding and subsequent inhibition of calcineurin by cain defines an independent regulatory site on calcineurin. We have further shown that this site is most likely distinct from the calmodulin-binding domain of calcineurin, as changes in calmodulin concentration produced no alteration in cain's inhibition of calcineurin activity. How might cain physiologically regulate calcineurin? Our limited subcellular fractionation experiments indicate that cain is a soluble, cytosolic protein. However, it could well translocate to the cytoskeleton to which it might be loosely bound. Cain may function as a scaffolding protein attached to numerous proteins besides calcineurin. Consistent with this is the fact that calcineurin binding to cain is restricted to a small area in the C-terminal portion of the protein. One might conceptualize functions of cain in analogy to AKAP79, another large protein that binds and inhibits calcineurin. For both cain and AKAP79, the putative calcineurin-binding site contains a preponderance of basic amino acid residues (44Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). AKAP79 binds cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C as well as calcineurin. Conceivably, cain could also bind kinases. Whether the kinase and phosphatase activities of proteins attached to cain are exerted upon cain itself is not clear, as phosphorylation patterns for cain have not yet been established. Although we have identified cain as an inhibitor of calcineurin, its physiological role may be to provide a docking site for calcineurin in its inactive form. In this regard, cain may target inactivated calcineurin to specific intracellular locations where its release would provide calcium-regulated phosphatase activity to specific signaling pathways. We thank Jenny Hong and Hyung Chun for expert technical assistance and careful reading of the manuscript. We also thank Roxanne Ashworth for sequencing the full-length cain cDNA, Noam Cohen for help with multiple tissue Western, Dr. Claude Klee for the generous gift of human CnAβ cDNA, Dr. Joseph Steiner for a gift of FK506, David Sabatini and members of the Snyder laboratory for helpful advice and insightful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2025930905,"IP10 and MIG are two members of the CXC branch of the chemokine superfamily whose expression is dramatically up-regulated by interferon (IFN)-γ. The proteins act largely on natural killer (NK)-cells and activated T-cells and have been implicated in mediating some of the effects of IFN-γ and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), as well as T-cell-dependent anti-tumor responses. Recently both chemokines have been shown to be functional agonists of the same G-protein-coupled receptor, CXCR3. We now report the pharmacological characterization of CXCR3 and find that, when heterologously expressed, CXCR3 binds IP10 and MIG with Ki values of 0.14 and 4.9 nm, respectively. The receptor has very modest affinity for SDF-1α and little or no affinity for other CXC-chemokines. The properties of the endogenous receptor expressed on activated T-cells are similar. Surprisingly, several CC-chemokines, particularly eotaxin and MCP-4, also compete with moderate affinity for the binding of IP10 to CXCR3. Eotaxin does not activate CXCR3 but, in CXCR3-transfected cells, can block IP10-mediated receptor activation. Eotaxin, therefore, may be a natural CXCR3 antagonist. IP10 and MIG are two members of the CXC branch of the chemokine superfamily whose expression is dramatically up-regulated by interferon (IFN)-γ. The proteins act largely on natural killer (NK)-cells and activated T-cells and have been implicated in mediating some of the effects of IFN-γ and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), as well as T-cell-dependent anti-tumor responses.

Chemokines are a superfamily of small secreted proteins that play an important role in the selective trafficking of leukocytes (for review, see Ref. 1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). Most members of the superfamily can be divided into two groups depending on the organization of the first cysteine pair: the CC branch in which the cysteines are adjacent, and the CXC-branch in which they are separated by a single amino acid. Two members of the CXC branch of the superfamily, IP10 and MIG, were initially identified because of their dramatically enhanced expression in monocytes activated by IFN-γ 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; LPS, lipopolysaccaride; CXCR, CXC receptor; CCR, CC receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. or LPS (2Luster A.D.

A. 1990; 87: 5238-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4Farber J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The biological actions of IP10 and MIG are largely restricted to activated T- and natural killer (NK)-cells for which both are potent chemoattractants (5Luster A.D. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 6Farber J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). These properties suggest that the two chemokines may mediate some of the lymphocyte-directed effects of IFN-γ and LPS, a hypothesis that is supported by the observation that IP10 elicits a potent T-cell-dependent antitumor response (5Luster A.D. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). IP10 and MIG are also strongly angiostatic (7Streiter R.M. Polverini P.J. Arenberg D.A. Walz A. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kunkel S.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 752-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), a property which may be related to their antitumor activity. Chemokines elicit their biological functions by binding to specific G protein-coupled receptors expressed on the appropriate cells types. Like the chemokines, the receptors can be largely divided into two sub-families: the CXC receptors (CXCRs), which bind CXC chemokines, and the CC receptors (CCRs), which bind CC-chemokines (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). Recently, Loetscher et al. (8Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) identified a new member of the CXCR subfamily, CXCR3, which when recombinantly expressed mediated chemotaxis and Ca2+ mobilization in response to both IP10 and MIG. However, these authors were unable to show binding of either ligand to CXCR3. We now demonstrate that CXCR3 does bind both IP10 and MIG with affinities consistent with the concentrations of the chemokines required to elicit cellular responses. In addition, CXCR3 has some avidity for the CXCR4 ligand, SDF-1, and rather surprisingly has considerable affinity for several CC-chemokines, particularly the CCR3 ligands eotaxin and MCP-4. The pharmacological properties of the recombinantly expressed receptor mirror those of the native receptor expressed on activated human T-cells. All human chemokines were from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ) except for SDF-1α, which was from Gryphon Sciences (South San Francisco, CA). Radioactive chemokines were from NEN Life Science Products. Venous whole blood or plasmapheresed leukocytes from normal human donors was obtained from the New York Blood Center or the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. The cDNA encoding CXCR3 was cloned by PCR using lymph node cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as a template. The PCR primers were designed based on the published sequence (8Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI andNotI and ligated to similarly digested and linearized pBluscript KS II+ (Promega). The sequence of the coding region of the receptor was verified by sequencing, then excised from pBS-CXCR3 by digestion with HindIII and NotI, and then ligated into mammalian expression vector pBJ-neo (9Daugherty B.L. Siciliano S.J. DeMartino J.A. Malkowitz L. Sirotina A. Springer M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). 106 CHO cells (ATCC: CCL-61) were transfected with 20 μg of DNA using a standard calcium phosphate procedure (Specialty Media, Lavallette, NJ). The DNA was incubated with cells at 37 °C, 6% CO2 for 6 h, whereupon the cells were glycerol-shocked (15% glycerol shock solution, Specialty Media) and re-fed with selection media containing 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Concurrently, RBL-2H3 cells were electroporated with the CXCR3 expression plasmid as described previously (13DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G. Siciliano S.J. Molineaux C.J. Konteatis Z.D. Rosen H. Springer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14446-14450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and selected in 1 mg/ml Geneticin. After 10 days, the surviving CHO or RBL foci were pooled. Stable expression of CXCR3 was verified by determining that an aliquot of cells bound radiolabeled IP10 (see binding parameters below). The remaining cells were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well microtiter plates, and the cells were expanded. Stable cell lines were derived from individual clones selected on the basis of binding and functional assays. Binding of 125I-IP10 (2200 Ci/mmol, typically 20 pm) in the presence of unlabeled ligands was initiated by adding intact cells (75,000 cells/point) as described previously (10Van Riper G. Siciliano S. Fischer P.A. Meurer R. Springer M.S. Rosen H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the cells were filtered through GF/C filters treated with 0.33% polyethyleneimine and washed with buffer containing 25 mmHepes, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.2. Functional assays were performed using microphysiometry (11McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 12Pitchford S. De Moor K. Glaeser B.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 2618: C936-C943Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, untransfected CHO-KI cells or CHO-KI cells stably transfected with human chemokine receptor CXCR3 were seeded onto the Transwell cell capsule cups (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at a density of 0.33 × 106cells/ml/cup in Ham's F-12 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Following overnight culture, the capsules were transferred to microphysiometer sensor chambers (Cytosensor, Molecular Devices) and allowed to equilibrate for 2 h, during which time they were perfused with running medium (1 mm phosphate-buffered RPMI 1640 medium, pH 7.4 (Molecular Devices) plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Life Technologies, Inc.)). Once stable acidification rates were established, cells were exposed for 6 min to various concentrations of chemokine diluted in running medium. A flow rate of 100 μl/min was used, and acidification rates were measured at 2 min intervals. Measurements were carried out with transfected cells or purified T-cells labeled with Indo-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (13DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G. Siciliano S.J. Molineaux C.J. Konteatis Z.D. Rosen H. Springer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14446-14450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T-cells were purified from a mononuclear cell preparation by E-rosetting with neuraminidase-treated sheep red blood cells, followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C. The T-cells were washed and incubated in plastic flasks at 2 × 106/ml in media containing 400 units/ml of human recombinant IL-2 (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) for 1–2 days, and further maintained at a density of 2–4 × 106/ml in fresh media containing IL-2 at 200 units/ml for the specified times. Because untransfected CHO cells do not bind 125I-IP10, lines stably expressing CXCR3 were established by monitoring the gain of this activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). The binding properties of a represenative CHO clone (C1.17) were assessed by competition of various chemokines against 125I-IP10 (Fig. 1 and TableI). The clone exhibits a single high affinity binding site (Ki = 0.14 nm) for IP10 and expresses approximately 50,000 sites/cell. As expected, the receptor also binds MIG, although with an affinity (Ki = 4.9 nm) that is substantially lower than that found for IP10. Other CXC-chemokines, notably IL-8, which binds to both CXCR1 and CXCR2 (14Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.-J. Rice G.L. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 15Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), and GROα and NAP2, which bind to CXCR2, have little or no affinity for CXCR3 (Table I). SDF-1, the ligand for CXCR4 (16Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 17Oberlin E.

Open table in a new tab Ki values were determined from competition binding experiments carried out against 125I-IP10 as described in the legends of Figures 1 and 2 and in the “Experimental Procedures” section. All values are given in nm and are the averages of two to three experiments. NB is no binding; ND not determined. Rather surprisingly, a number of CC-chemokines show moderate affinity for CXCR3, in particular the ligands for CCR3 (9Daugherty B.L. Siciliano S.J. DeMartino J.A. Malkowitz L. Sirotina A. Springer M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 18Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Eotaxin and MCP-4 have Ki values of 60 and 70 nm, whereas MCP-3 and RANTES have lower affinities withKi values of 250 and 420 nm, respectively. Because CCR6 and CCR7 are phylogenetically more closely related to CXCR3 than is CCR3, we also examined the ability of their ligands (MIP-3α and MIP-3β) to bind to CXCR3. MIP-3α does bind with some affinity (Ki = 160 nm), although MIP-3β shows very little activity (Ki = 1700 nm). Similarly, MIP 1α, MIP1β, and MCP-1, ligands for CCRs 1, 2, and 5 (reviewed in Ref. 1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar) show little or no affinity for the receptor (data not shown). Since a number of factors, including differences in the endogenous complement of G-proteins or various other host cell-specific restrictions, may influence the way in which ligands bind to their receptors, we compared the pharmacology of the receptor recombinantly expressed in CHO cells to endogenously expressed CXCR3 and to receptor expressed in RBL-2H3 cells. It has been reported that transcripts for CXCR3 are virtually absent in resting T-cells but are present in IL-2-activated T-cells (8Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). In our hands, the ability of human T-cells to bind IP10 is consistent with these observations. Freshly isolated T-cells show variable but low binding activity, an activity that is substantially up-regulated by a number of activation procedures including treatment with anti-CD3/anti-CD28, phorbal 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin, or IL-2 (data not shown). To characterize the pharmacology of CXCR3 on primary cells, we chose to use T-cells treated with IL-2 for 6–8 days, a protocol that generates maximal binding of IP10 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 and Table I, the properties of the receptor on the primary cells closely mirrors that of the recombinant molecule expressed in CHO cells. TheKi cells are 2–3-fold lower on average, but the receptors in both cell types bind the same ligands with the same rank order of potencies. Similar affinities were also obtained for receptor recombinantly expressed in RBL-2H3 cells (Table I). The earlier identification and characterization of CXCR3 was carried out by assessing the ability of various CXC- and CC-chemokines to mobilize calcium in murine 300–19 pre-B cells transfected with the receptor. In these experiments, Loetscher et al. found IP10 and MIG to be the only chemokines to induce a response, and as a consequence, they referred to CXCR3 as the IP10/MIG receptor. To confirm and extend this preliminary characterization and to determine whether the concentrations of IP10 and MIG required for functional activation reflect the ligands' differential affinities, we also evaluated the functional properties of the receptor in the stably transfected CHO cell line. Since in our hands CHO cells are refractory to the uptake of calcium sensitive dyes, a microphysiometer was used to monitor ligand-induced increases in cellular acidification rate as a measure of functional activation (11McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 3 both IP10 and MIG induce dose-dependent increases in the acidification rate. As expected from the binding data, IP10 is more potent than MIG with EC50 values of ∼10 and 100–200 nm, respectively. In fact, the ratio of EC50 values for the two ligands (10Van Riper G.

Science. 1993; 261: 1182-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) is consistent with the relative binding affinities (∼30, Table I). In comparison, eotaxin failed to generate any response, even at a concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 3 B), a value 15-fold greater than its Kias determined in binding studies (Table I). We also examined the ability of IP10, MIG, and eotaxin to stimulate functional responses in activated human T-cells and transfected RBL cells. For these studies, increases in intracellular Ca2+levels were used to monitor responses. The data are consistent with the results from the recombinant CHO lines. As shown in Fig. 4, in activated primary T-cells, both IP10 and MIG induced a flux at a concentration of 100 nm, whereas eotaxin failed to generate a response, even at a concentration of 1 μm. Interestingly, since a subset of Th2 T-cells has been reported to express CCR3 (19Sallusto F. Mackay C.R. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1997; 277: 2005-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), the primary receptor for eotaxin, the lack of response to eotaxin also suggests that our T-cell preparations contain a very low level of this subset. High concentrations of eotaxin (up to 1 μm) also failed to induce a Ca2+-flux in our stable RBL CXCR3 transfected line (Fig. 5), whereas the EC50 of IP10 for this response was 10 nm (data not shown).Figure 5Eotaxin inhibits IP10-mediated CXCR3-dependent Ca2+ mobilization in RBL CXCR3 cells. The data represent Ca2+ fluxes mediated by 10 nm IP10 in cells pretreated 5 min before analysis with buffer alone (⋄) or a final concentration of either 1 μm (▵) or 3 μm (□) eotaxin. No further suppression of the IP10 response was achieved by extending the titration of eotaxin above 3 μm. A single point reflecting the maximal functional activation of the receptor to IP10 after pretreatment with 10 μm IL-8 (•) shows that the effect of eotaxin is specific since the slight diminution in response is within the limits of experimental variability. Eotaxin at a concentration of 3 μm (▿) does not itself induce a flux in these cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The binding and functional data suggest that eotaxin, under appropriate circumstances, should act as a receptor antagonist. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of eotaxin to inhibit an IP10-induced Ca2+-flux in the transfected RBL cells. As shown in Fig. 5, eotaxin does inhibit the response to 10 nmIP10 with and IC50 of about 1 μm, a potency consistent with the 100-fold difference in binding affinities (TableI). As a control, IL-8 had no effect at concentrations as high as 10 μm. The chemokine system consists of more than 50 ligands and 13 receptors. The specificities of the ligand/receptor interactions are complex as each receptor binds multiple chemokines and most chemokines bind to more than one receptor. However, a general rule has been that a chemokine receptor binds either CC- or CXC-chemokines but not both. The one exception has been DARC, a highly promiscuous, ubiquitously expressed, nonsignaling receptor whose function is unclear (20Horuk R. Chitnis C.E. Darbonne W.C. Colby T.J. Rybicki A. Hadley T.J. Miller L.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1182-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 21Szabo M.C. Soo K.S. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25348-25351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus it is surprising to find that CXCR3 has moderate affinity for several CC-chemokines, particularly those which bind to CCR3. In fact, those affinities are higher than for any of the CXC-chemokines examined here, except IP10 and MIG. It would appear, therefore, that overall protein sequence homologies are not a sufficient means from which to predict the class of ligand (CC or CXC) a given receptor may bind. Moreover, since the primary CXCR3 ligands, IP10 and MIG, also show moderate affinities for CCR3 (Ki values of 100 and 30 nm, respectively 2Y. Weng, S. J. Siciliano, K. E. Waldburger, A. Sirotina-Meisher, M. J. Staruch, B. L. Daugherty, S. L. Gould, Martin S. Springer, and Julie A. DeMartino, unpublished observations. ), it is also likely that CXCR3 and CCR3 possess structural homology that enables them to present key interactions to shared ligands. An important but as yet unanswered question, given the modest affinities that the CCR3 ligands show for CXCR3 and vice versa, is whether these overlapping ligand specificities are physiologically relevant. It is tempting to believe they are. In vivo, there is a correlation between strong TH2 responses and the diminished accumulation of TH1 cells (22Weiner H.I. Friedman A. Miller A. Khoury S.J. Al-Sabbagh A. Santos L. Sayegh M. Nussenblatt R.B. Trentham D.E. Hafler D.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 809-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 23Ploix C.B.I. Fabien N. Perche S.M.V. Thivolet C. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since CCR3 is expressed on cells characteristic of TH2 responses, including a subset of TH2 T-cells (19Sallusto F. Mackay C.R. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1997; 277: 2005-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar,24Bonecchi R. Bianchi G. Bordignon P.P. D'Ambrozio D. Lang R. Borsatti A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Gray P.A. Mantovani A. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar) and whereas CXCR3 is found predominately on TH1 T-cells (24Bonecchi R. Bianchi G. Bordignon P.P. D'Ambrozio D. Lang R. Borsatti A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Gray P.A. Mantovani A. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar), the putative antagonistic effects of the CCR3 ligands on CXCR3 could impair the accumulation of TH1 cells and in part account for some of the inhibitory activity of TH2 responses. Considerable additional evidence is needed to support this speculation, including the direct demonstration that CCR3 ligands do indeed antagonize the effects of IP10 and MIG on TH1 cells. Moreover, sufficient local concentrations of the CCR3 chemokines have to be achieved in order for such antagonism to occur. In this regard, it is currently thought that much of the chemokine generated in vivo is bound to surface proteoglycan, a modality that has been argued to greatly increase the local concentration, particularly because the interaction with the receptor occurs on a solid phase (25Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S.V. Proudfoot A.E.I. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Regardless of whether the above argument is true, our data suggest that chemokines may play a dual regulatory role, as agonists for some responses and antagonists for others. We thank Joseph Borkowski for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2065680809,"EBP50 (ezrin-radixin-moesin-bindingphosphoprotein 50) was recently identified by affinity chromatography on the immobilized NH2-terminal domain of ezrin. Here we map and characterize the regions in EBP50 and ezrin necessary for this association. Using blot overlays and in solution binding assays, the COOH-terminal 30 residues of EBP50 were found to be sufficient for an association with residues 1–286 of ezrin. EBP50 did not bind to full-length (1–585) ezrin, indicating that the EBP50 binding site is masked in the full-length molecule. Ezrin contains two complementary self-association domains known as N- and C-ERMADs (ezrin-radixin-moesin-associationdomains), encompassing residues 1–296 and 479–585, respectively. An ezrin 1–583 construct lacking the two terminal residues necessary for this association was found to have an unmasked EBP50 binding site. Moreover, binding of EBP50 and the C-ERMAD to ezrin residues 1–296 was found to be mutually exclusive, with the C-ERMAD having a higher affinity. These results suggest that in full-length ezrin, the binding site for EBP50 is masked through an intramolecular N/C-ERMAD association. Based on these and additional results, we propose a model whereby dormant ezrin can be activated to bind EBP50 on its NH2-terminal end and F-actin on its COOH-terminal end. Since EBP50 is proposed to bind membrane proteins through its PDZ domains, this provides a molecular description of the regulated linkage of microfilaments to membranes in cell surface microvilli. EBP50 (ezrin-radixin-moesin-bindingphosphoprotein 50) was recently identified by affinity chromatography on the immobilized NH2-terminal domain of ezrin. Here we map and characterize the regions in EBP50 and ezrin necessary for this association. Using blot overlays and in solution binding assays, the COOH-terminal 30 residues of EBP50 were found to be sufficient for an association with residues 1–286 of ezrin. EBP50 did not bind to full-length (1–585) ezrin, indicating that the EBP50 binding site is masked in the full-length molecule. Ezrin contains two complementary self-association domains known as N- and C-ERMADs (ezrin-radixin-moesin-associationdomains), encompassing residues 1–296 and 479–585, respectively. An ezrin 1–583 construct lacking the two terminal residues necessary for this association was found to have an unmasked EBP50 binding site. Moreover, binding of EBP50 and the C-ERMAD to ezrin residues 1–296 was found to be mutually exclusive, with the C-ERMAD having a higher affinity. These results suggest that in full-length ezrin, the binding site for EBP50 is masked through an intramolecular N/C-ERMAD association. Based on these and additional results, we propose a model whereby dormant ezrin can be activated to bind EBP50 on its NH2-terminal end and F-actin on its COOH-terminal end. Since EBP50 is proposed to bind membrane proteins through its PDZ domains, this provides a molecular description of the regulated linkage of microfilaments to membranes in cell surface microvilli. Polarized epithelial cells assemble distinct apical and basolateral domains for the transport of small molecules. The apical domain is generally characterized by the presence of abundant microvilli in which reside specific membrane-bound transport proteins. Recent studies aimed at understanding the mechanism of microvillus formation have focused on ezrin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) 1The abbreviations used are: ERM, ezrin-radixin-moesin; EBP50, ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50; N- and C-ERMAD, NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal ERM-association domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E3KARP, NHE3 kinase A regulatory protein; Rho-GDI, Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor. protein family that performs both a regulatory and structural role in the assembly of microvilli (1Bretscher A.

Another member of the band 4.1 superfamily is merlin, the product of the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene, which shares about 60% identity to ERM proteins over this same region (8Rouleau G.A.

The ERM proteins, which are about 580 residues in length, have a ∼300 residue NH2-terminal domain that can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane protein CD44 (10Hirao M. Sato N.

Following this domain is a region predicted to be largely α-helical. An F-actin binding site has been mapped to the 34 COOH-terminal residues (14Turunen O. Wahlstrom T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 15Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), although recent studies suggest that association with actin might be more complex (16Roy C. Martin M. Mangeat P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20088-20095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition to these potential interactions, the ERM proteins have the ability to form homo- and heterotypic associations between family members (17Gary R. Bretscher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10846-10850Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The first 296 residues of each member defines a domain that can form a high affinity association with the 107-residue COOH-terminal region of any ERM protein; these have been called NH2- and COOH-ERM association domains (N- and C-ERMADs) (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). These self-association domains are not constitutively available for spontaneous oligomerization in vivo, as the bulk of ezrin exists in the cytoplasm in a monomeric form (19Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Studies with native monomeric ezrin have revealed that the C-ERMAD, as well as the COOH-terminal F-actin binding site, is conformationally masked (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Regulated self-association seems to be physiologically relevant as dimers and other oligomers are the predominant forms of ezrin in isolated placental microvilli, and dimer formation can be induced in cultured cells by the activation of signaling pathways in a time course that parallels microvillus assembly (21Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These combined results led us to propose that the bulk of the ezrin in cells exists in a dormant monomeric conformation in which sites for self-association and association with other proteins are masked. Ezrin activation is proposed to lead to the exposure of sites for both oligomerization and interaction with membrane and cytoskeletal components (21Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 1Bretscher A. Reczek D. Berryman M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3011-3018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently described human EBP50, a 358-residue protein that was identified by affinity chromatography on resins containing the NH2-terminal domains of ezrin or moesin (11Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Analysis of the EBP50 sequence revealed that it contains two PDZ domains followed by a ∼120-residue COOH-terminal tail. Localization of EBP50 in tissues and cultured cells shows that it colocalizes with ezrin in apical microvilli. The existence of complexes of ezrin and EBP50 in extracts of isolated microvilli indicates that the binding of EBP50 to ezrin is of physiological significance. The probable rabbit homologue of human EBP50, the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor, has been identified as a protein necessary for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A regulation of the renal Na+/H+ exchanger (22Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). A closely related protein, the NHE3 kinase A regulatory protein (E3KARP), was identified in a two-hybrid interaction screen using the cytoplasmic domain of the renal Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 isoform as bait (24Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, a likely scenario places EBP50 as an adaptor protein between NHE3 and ezrin at least in the renal brush border. Very recently, EBP50 was identified in another two-hybrid screen, this time using the NH2-terminal domain of merlin as bait (12Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In this paper, we identify and characterize the regions in ezrin necessary for interaction with EBP50 and the regions in EBP50 necessary for an interaction with ezrin. Since the NH2-terminal domain of ezrin can bind both EBP50 and the ezrin C-ERMAD, we also examine the relationship between these binding sites. Our results show that the binding of EBP50 and the C-ERMAD to the ezrin NH2-terminal domain are mutually exclusive and hierarchical and that both binding sites are masked in the full-length molecule. The masking of the EBP50 binding site in dormant ezrin provides further biochemical evidence that ezrin has to be activated for its membrane-cytoskeletal linking function. These findings allow us to propose a model of molecular linkages that lead to the attachment of microfilaments to the plasma membrane. The design and production of the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ezrin deletion series (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and of the EBP50 and Ez-(1–296) constructs have been described (11Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The full-length Ez-(1–585) and the Ez-(479–585) (C-ERMAD) constructs were created by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the respective cDNA sequences from clone F6 (4Gould K.L. Bretscher A. Esch F.S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4133-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) using primers that generated EcoRI andHindIII sites at their ends. These products were then subcloned into the expression vector pQE16 (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). The series of GST-EBP50 proteins containing NH2- and COOH-terminal deletions was created by a combination of polymerase chain reaction amplification and subcloning of sequences from the human EBP50 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF015926). The polymerase chain reaction products that had been generated with unique restriction sites at their ends and the fragments to be subcloned were directionally ligated into the polylinkers of the appropriate pGEX series fusion vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All recombinant sequences were determined to be free of polymerase chain reaction errors by nucleotide sequence analysis. Restriction enzymes and other reagents for molecular biology were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The expression of the GST-ezrin series constructs (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and of the Ez-(1–296) construct (11Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) has been described. GST-EBP50 deletion series constructs were transformed into the Escherichia colistrain DH5α and expressed like the GST-ezrin constructs. For the expression of EBP50 and Ez-(479–585), the plasmids encoding these constructs were transformed into the E. coli strain JM109. Truncated murine dihydrofolate reductase, encoded on the QIAGEN pQE16 vector, was also expressed in JM109. Saturated overnight cultures were inoculated at 1:20 dilution in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown for 90 min at 37 °C. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 2 mm, and cells were grown for an additional 180 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min. Gel samples of total soluble bacterial lysates were prepared by resuspending the soluble lysates in 1 volume of SDS sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) and boiling for 2 min. The purification of the bacterially expressed Ez-(1–296) was performed as described (11Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The purification of bacterially expressed full-length ezrin was done in essentially the same manner (sequential chromatography on hydroxyapatite and S-Sepharose resins), except that the hydroxyapatite column was developed using a 160–800 mmKH2PO4 linear gradient. Homogenous ezrin eluted at ∼400 mm NaCl from the S-Sepharose column. Purified ezrin or Ez-(1–296) were covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) at equal molar ratios (∼4 mg/ml and ∼2 mg/ml resin, respectively), as described (11Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Glutathione-agarose beads with immobilized GST or GST fusion protein were prepared essentially according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Soluble bacterial lysates were made by resuspending induced cells from 50 ml of culture in 1.2 ml of Tris-buffered saline (50 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C) containing 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 75 μg/ml benzamidine, lysing by sonication (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT), and clarifying by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 10 min. Binding assays were carried out by mixing 50 μl of a 25% slurry of coupled beads or glutathione fusion protein beads, with soluble induced bacterial cell lysate for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline made up to 0.5 mNaCl, and bound proteins were extracted by boiling for 2 min in SDS sample buffer. For challenge reactions, the fifth wash after the first incubation with lysate was done in Tris-buffered saline made up to 150 mm NaCl, the beads were put through a second round of incubation and washing, and bound proteins were extracted. In the case where EBP50- or C-ERMAD-containing lysate was added in increasing amounts, reaction volumes were normalized with Tris-buffered saline. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar), and protein samples were analyzed on 10, 11, or 13.3% gels. In some cases, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For blots, proteins were transferred from gels to polyvinylidene membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a semidry electroblotter (Integrated Separation Systems, Hyde Park, MA). All blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some cases, blots were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 after development to assess the efficiency of protein transfer. Biotinylated Ez-(1–296) and EBP50 probes were prepared, and blot overlays were performed as described (17Gary R. Bretscher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10846-10850Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The biotinyl probes were omitted in control experiments. Peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Sigma) was used to detect biotin-labeled proteins. Immunoblots were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk, then probed with a 1:10000 dilution of GST antiserum (Amersham) in 1% milk, followed by 0.1 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in 1% milk. The NH2-terminal domain of ezrin (Ez-(1–296)) binds to EBP50 with high affinity in solution and by blot overlay (11Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). To define the region in EBP50 that interacts with Ez-(1–296), a series of recombinant GST-EBP50 fusion proteins containing intact EBP50 or NH2- and COOH-terminal deletions, was generated and expressed in bacteria (Fig. 1). Analysis of lysates of induced bacteria show that the major induced polypeptides correspond to the GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1, upper andmiddle panels). Some of the GST-EBP50 fusion proteins exhibited an anomalously slow migration, like that seen for native EBP50 (11Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Plots of RF versus log molecular weight indicated that the regions of EBP50 responsible for the majority of this retardation lie within residues 97–138 and 242–320. To determine the region in EBP50 necessary for association with Ez-(1–296), a blot overlay assay was employed in which biotinylated recombinant Ez-(1–296) was used as a probe on the GST-EBP50 fusion protein series (Fig. 1, bottom panel). The Ez-(1–296) probe bound only to those EBP50 constructs that contained an intact COOH terminus. A 61-residue COOH-terminal truncation was not recognized (Fig. 1, lane B), whereas all constructs that contained the COOH-terminal 30 residues (329–358) of EBP50 bound Ez-(1–296). Although we have previously found that Ez-(1–296) binds to EBP50in vitro, we wished to investigate whether additional regions in ezrin bind to EBP50 and to further refine the minimal region necessary for this interaction. Use was made of the GST-ezrin fusion constructs described previously (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) that contain NH2- and COOH-terminal deletions of ezrin fused to GST (Fig. 2, top panel, Coomassie stain;middle panel, GST immunoblot). Since biotinylated EBP50 will bind to Ez-(1–296) in blot overlays (11Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), this technique was used to examine the regions in ezrin necessary for interaction with EBP50. Only those constructs that contained the first 286 residues of ezrin bound the probe, demonstrating that these residues alone were sufficient for the binding of EBP50 (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Remarkably, EBP50 failed to bind to the full-length ezrin fusion protein, whereas it did bind to a construct lacking just two COOH-terminal residues (1–583) (Fig. 2, lanes A and B, respectively). These results, summarized in Fig. 3, indicate that the COOH-terminal 30 residues of EBP50 interact specifically with the NH2-terminal 286 residues of ezrin and that this interaction can, at least by blot overlay, be inhibited by a COOH-terminal region of ezrin. The N-ERMAD (Ez-(1–296)) and C-ERMAD (Ez-(479–585)) of ezrin bind each other with high affinity in vitro. In native full-length ezrin, the C-ERMAD is masked and therefore unable to bind a free ectopic N-ERMAD (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). To explore whether or not the binding site for EBP50 in Ez-(1–296) is accessible in native ezrin, we compared the ability of full-length ezrin and Ez-(1–296) to bind recombinant EBP50. Additionally, since it has not been determined whether the N-ERMAD is accessible in full-length ezrin, we also compared the abilities of full-length ezrin and Ez-(1–296) to bind recombinant C-ERMAD. Untagged, recombinant versions of full-length ezrin and Ez-(1–296) were expressed as soluble proteins in bacteria and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 4 A). The purified proteins were then coupled covalently to beads to make affinity resins. Total soluble bacterial lysates expressing either a portion of the murine dihydrofolate reductase protein as a nonspecific control or untagged EBP50 or untagged C-ERMAD were prepared (Fig. 4 B) and incubated with each set of beads. After extensive washing in high salt buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4 C). Neither EBP50 nor the C-ERMAD bound to full-length ezrin (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3 and5, respectively), whereas both bound to Ez-(1–296) (Fig. 4 C, lanes 4 and 6, respectively). No proteins from the control lysate bound to either set of beads (Fig. 4,lanes 1 and 2). Thus, the binding sites for EBP50 and an ectopic C-ERMAD are masked in native ezrin. How might this masking occur? Given that the C-ERMAD itself is masked in native ezrin (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and having demonstrated that the N-ERMAD is inaccessible to ectopic C-ERMAD, we considered the possibility that masking in the full-length protein was due to an intramolecular N/C-ERMAD association. Since removal of the last two residues from full-length ezrin abolishes the activity of its endogenous C-ERMAD (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), we generated and purified Ez-(1–583) lacking the last two COOH-terminal residues. If masking is normally dependent on an intramolecular association between N- and C-ERMADs, then binding sites that are normally cryptic in the full-length molecule should now be accessible in this truncated form. To examine this possibility, saturating amounts of lysates of Ez-(1–296), Ez-(1–583), and full-length ezrin (Fig. 4 D) were each incubated with beads containing immobilized GST-EBP50 COOH-terminal fusion protein (residues 320–358). After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Both Ez-(1–296) and Ez-(1–583) bound tightly to the EBP50 beads (Fig. 4 E, lanes 2 and3, respectively), whereas the binding of full-length ezrin was negligible (lane 4). No proteins from a control lysate bound to the beads (lane 1), and no specific binding of any proteins from the lysates bound to GST control beads (data not shown). These data suggest that the masking of the EBP50 binding site and of the N- and C-ERMADs in native ezrin is a consequence of an intramolecular N/C-ERMAD association in full-length native monomeric ezrin. The region in ezrin required for binding EBP50 lies within residues 1–286 (Figs. 2 and 3), whereas the region necessary for binding the C-ERMAD lies in residues 1–296, with 1–286 being insufficient for this interaction (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to determine whether Ez-(1–296) was able to bind EBP50 and the C-ERMAD simultaneously or if their binding was mutually exclusive. Our strategy was to saturate immobilized Ez-(1–296) with EBP50 and then to examine whether EBP50 could be displaced by the subsequent addition of C-ERMAD. The quantity of EBP50-containing bacterial lysate needed to saturate all the Ez-(1–296) sites was determined by adding increasing amounts of lysate to replicate sets of beads. The beads were washed extensively, and bound EBP50 was eluted and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5 A). Increasing amounts of lysate resulted in larger amounts of bound EBP50 (lanes 1–5) until a saturation point was reached where the addition of more lysate did not result in any further increase (lanes 6–7). This amount of EBP50-containing lysate was used to saturate replicate sets of Ez-(1–296) beads that were then challenged with increasing amounts of C-ERMAD-containing lysate (Fig. 5 B). As the amount of lysate was increased, bound C-ERMAD increased and bound EBP50 decreased (lanes 1–5) until a point at which the addition of more C-ERMAD lysate did not result in any further increase in bound C-ERMAD (lanes 6–7). These results indicate that the C-ERMAD can displace the bulk of EBP50 from Ez-(1–296). Why does some EBP50 remain bound, even at saturating amounts of C-ERMAD? Repeated challenging with additional saturating amounts of C-ERMAD did not displace any more of the residual EBP50 (data not shown), indicating that this population is bound in a C-ERMAD-insensitive fashion. Since the binding of the C-ERMAD requires ezrin residues 1–296, whereas EBP50 requires only 1–286, it is likely that a portion of the immobilized Ez-(1–296) molecules are coupled in such a way as to allow the binding of EBP50 but to preclude the binding of the C-ERMAD. To explore the hierarchy of C-ERMAD and EBP50 binding further, the effect of changing the order of ligand addition was also examined. Lysates from bacteria expressing either the dihydrofolate reductase fragment, untagged EBP50, or the untagged ezrin C-ERMAD were each added in sufficient quantities to replicate sets of beads to saturate all the sites on the coupled Ez-(1–296). The beads were washed extensively in high salt buffer, one set eluted, and the bound proteins were analyzed (Fig. 5 C). As expected, EBP50 and the C-ERMAD were specifically and efficiently retained (lanes 1–3). The second set of Ez-(1–296) beads, to which EBP50 or the C-ERMAD were already bound, was challenged with bacterial lysates containing the expressed dihydrofolate reductase fragment, washed extensively, and eluted (lanes 4 and 5). There was no diminution of the amount of EBP50 or C-ERMAD retained by treatment with this nonspecific control extract. In the third set of beads, each was challenged with lysates containing the alternate ligand. When beads with bound C-ERMAD were challenged with EBP50, there was no diminution in the amount of bound C-ERMAD, but a small amount of EBP50 was also retained (lane 7). However, when beads with bound EBP50 were challenged with C-ERMAD, the bulk of the EBP50 was displaced (lane 6), and the beads bound an amount of C-ERMAD equivalent to the saturated controls (lanes 3 and5). These results indicate that EBP50 cannot readily displace bound C-ERMAD from immobilized Ez-(1–296), whereas the C-ERMAD can displace the bulk of the EBP50, indicating that the binding of the two proteins to Ez-(1–296) is mutually exclusive. Furthermore, they show that the C-ERMAD binds Ez-(1–296) with greater affinity than EBP50. In this study we have investigated the sites of interaction between EBP50 and ezrin. The results show that the COOH-terminal 30 residues of EBP50 are sufficient for an association with ezrin and that the EBP50 binding site in ezrin lies within the first 286 residues where it is masked in the native molecule. We have also shown that the binding of EBP50 to Ez-(1–296) can be inhibited by the C-ERMAD (Ez-(479–585)). These results have interesting implications for the modes of action of both EBP50 and ezrin. Human EBP50 is 55% identical to human E3KARP, a 337-residue protein with two PDZ domains that interacts directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 isoform (24Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal 30 residues of EBP50 that bind ezrin are especially well conserved in E3KARP (Fig. 6), suggesting that E3KARP might also bind Ez-(1–296). This proposal is supported by preliminary experiments in which a GST-E3KARP fusion protein was found to bind Ez-(1–296) (or moesin residues 1–296) with high affinity. 2D. Reczek and A. Bretscher, unpublished data. In addition, ezrin and band 4.1 have been reported to bind to hDlg (26Marfatia S.M. Cabral J.H.M. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chisti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the human homolog of the Drosophila discs large protein. Inspection of the region in hDlg believed to be responsible for this association revealed limited sequence identity to the COOH-terminal regions of EBP50 and E3KARP (Fig. 6). It is therefore possible that the nature of the interaction between ezrin and EBP50 is similar to that between ezrin or band 4.1 and hDlg. So far there is no evidence to indicate that the binding of EBP50 to Ez-(1–296) is regulated at the level of EBP50, since full-length and truncated forms of EBP50 containing the COOH-terminal 30 residues bind Ez-(1–296), and immobilized Ez-(1–296) binds to different phosphorylated forms of EBP50 present in tissue extracts (11Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). By contrast, the binding site for EBP50 is masked in full-length ezrin. When a series of bacterially expressed GST-ezrin deletion constructs were tested for their ability to bind an EBP50 probe in a blot overlay assay, all constructs containing ezrin residues 1–286 bound EBP50, with the remarkable exception of the full-length (1–585) construct. Removal of two COOH-terminal residues from ezrin restored the ability of EBP50 to bind it in the blot overlay assay (Fig. 2). The same phenomenon was seen when the binding of Ez-(1–583) and full-length ezrin to EBP50 were compared in solution (Fig. 4 E). Since removal of these two residues destroys the ability of the C-ERMAD to bind the N-ERMAD (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), the most likely interpretation is that the C-ERMAD inhibits the binding of EBP50 to Ez-(1–296). We therefore suggest that in full-length ezrin, the C-ERMAD forms an intramolecular association with the N-ERMAD, thereby masking the potential EBP50 binding site in Ez-(1–296). Such a scenario would imply that EBP50 and the C-ERMAD cannot bind Ez-(1–296) simultaneously and that bound C-ERMAD cannot be displaced by soluble EBP50. These predictions are supported by our solution binding results (Figs. 4 and 5). What is the relationship between the binding sites on Ez-(1–296) for EBP50 and the C-ERMAD (Ez-(479–585))? Several observations suggest that the two binding sites are not identical. First, the C-ERMAD requires ezrin residues 1–296 for full activity (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), whereas EBP50 binds to constructs containing only residues 1–286. The additional 10 residues needed for C-ERMAD binding are highly basic (pI = 10.98) and the C-ERMAD is more acidic (pI = 5.45) than the 30 residues in EBP50 sufficient for binding ezrin (pI = 10.56), suggesting that charge interactions in this region may be important for C-ERMAD binding. Second, immobilized Ez-(1–296) has sites that are accessible to EBP50 but not to the C-ERMAD. Third, there is no obvious sequence homology between the C-ERMAD and the COOH-terminal tail region of EBP50 that binds to Ez-(1–296). These results suggest that the binding sites are either distinct or overlap in such a way that binding of the C-ERMAD reduces the affinity of EBP50 for Ez-(1–296). If the sites are distinct, binding of the C-ERMAD must induce a conformational change in Ez-(1–296) that reduces its affinity for EBP50. Future structural analyses will be needed to distinguish unambiguously between these possibilities. We have so far considered the interaction of Ez-(1–296) with EBP50 and the C-ERMAD. However, this same domain has also been reported to bind to both Rho-GDI (13Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita Sa. Tsukita Sh. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic tail of the transmembrane protein CD44 (10Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita Sh. Tsukita Sa. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Like EBP50, Rho-GDI can bind to a domain consisting of residues 1–286, and this binding can be abrogated by subsequent addition of a C-ERMAD (13Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita Sa. Tsukita Sh. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Since the C-ERMAD, EBP50, Rho-GDI, and the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 do not share any obvious sequence homology, it will be important to determine how many binding sites exist on Ez-(1–296) and, if mutually exclusive, what their binding hierarchy is. How do these results relate to the current ideas of ezrin function? Previous studies have demonstrated that the C-ERMAD of ezrin, which contains the COOH-terminal F-actin binding site, is masked in the dormant full-length molecule (18Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Moreover, the site in Ez-(1–296) for association with CD44 is partially masked in full-length ezrin (10Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita Sh. Tsukita Sa. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) as is the site for association with Rho-GDI (13Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita Sa. Tsukita Sh. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In addition, we now show that the N-ERMAD is masked in the dormant full-length molecule. The finding that dormant ezrin does not bind EBP50, whereas EBP50/ezrin complexes can be isolated from purified placental microvilli (11Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), is strong evidence in support of a dormancy/activation model. Thus, the full-length molecule has the ability to assume a dormant conformation in which the COOH-terminal F-actin binding site, the self-association sites, and the association sites for EBP50, CD44, and Rho-GDI are all masked. Our current data suggest that this dormancy is due to an intramolecular N/C-ERMAD interaction, although other models are not formally excluded. To function, the dormant ezrin monomer has to be activated to expose appropriate binding sites. At present the effectors of activation or the specific activation pathway have not been elucidated, although evidence exists to suggest that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin might be involved (10Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita Sh. Tsukita Sa. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 20Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 21Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,28Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). One simple way to maintain the molecule in an activated state would be to inactivate the C-ERMAD by phosphorylation and thereby inhibit the proposed intramolecular association responsible for masking. The degree of phosphorylation of Thr-558 of moesin, which lies in the C-ERMAD, is enhanced during platelet activation, concomitant with an increase in cytoskeletally association moesin (29Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of the equivalent residue in ezrin, Thr-567, by Rho kinase abolishes C-ERMAD activity without affecting the COOH-terminal F-actin binding site (30Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita Sa. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Thus, an ezrin molecule phosphorylated on Thr-567 would be predicted to bind F-actin through its COOH-terminal domain and EBP50 or CD44 through its NH2-terminal domain, thereby providing a molecular linkage between the membrane and cortical microfilaments. Since activation to expose binding sites is proposed to precede phosphorylation of Thr-567 (30Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita Sa. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), self-association through exposed N- and C-ERMADs can also be accommodated into this model. Oligomer formation could involve binding of an exposed C-ERMAD of one activated ezrin molecule to the N-ERMAD of a second activated molecule in a head-to-tail configuration (1Bretscher A. Reczek D. Berryman M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3011-3018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). If a C-ERMAD of an oligomer is phosphorylated, this would preclude the addition of another activated molecule at that end and allow the association with F-actin; the NH2-terminal end of the oligomer would have unmasked sites for association with EBP50, CD44, or Rho-GDI. A recent report demonstrated that EBP50 binds to the NH2-terminal domain of merlin, a protein showing 61% sequence identity to ezrin over this region (12Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We have also found that EBP50 will bind to bacterially expressed recombinant NH2-terminal domain (residues 1–313) of merlin.2 So far it is not known whether the affinity of EBP50 for merlin is as high as that for ezrin or whether the EBP50 binding site is masked in full-length merlin. Resolution of these points will determine how EBP50 is partitioned between ERM members and merlin and how this is altered by the stimulation of signal transduction pathways that activate ERM members. Thus, it appears that we are just beginning to glimpse the intricate and regulated nature of the associations in which the ezrin family of proteins can participate. Further studies will have to examine how ezrin selects among its many suitors, what the physiological role of each association is, and why a single protein participates in so many regulated associations. We are grateful to Dr. C. Yun for providing us with the GST-E3KARP fusion construct and to Dr. Mark Berryman for comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2033944552,"A complex of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) 4A, 4E, and 4G (collectively termed eIF4F) plays a key role in recruiting mRNAs to ribosomes during translation initiation. The site of ribosomal entry onto most mRNAs is determined by interaction of the 5′-terminal cap with eIF4E; eIFs 4A and 4G may facilitate ribosomal entry by modifying mRNA structure near the cap and by interacting with ribosome-associated factors. eIF4G recruits uncapped encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) mRNA to ribosomes without the involvement of eIF4E by binding directly to the ∼450-nucleotide long EMCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES). We have used chemical and enzymatic probing to map the eIF4G binding site to a structural element within the J-K domain of the EMCV IRES that consists of an oligo(A) loop at the junction of three helices. The oligo(A) loop itself is not sufficient to form stable complexes with eIF4G since alteration of its structural context abolished its interaction with eIF4G. Addition of wild type ortrans-dominant mutant forms of eIF4A to binary IRES·eIF4G complexes did not further alter the pattern of chemical/enzymatic modification of the IRES."

Iron is required as a cofactor for critical proteins within mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. These proteins include heme and iron-sulfur proteins involved in diverse processes such as cellular respiration and the synthesis of metabolic intermediates. However iron is also extremely toxic, capable of generating damaging free radicals (3Cammack R. Wrigglesworth J.M. Baum H. Ponka P. Schulman H.M. Woodworth R.C. Iron Transport and Storage. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1990: 17-39Google Scholar). Therefore, homeostatic mechanisms exist that regulate iron levels and iron protein levels within mitochondria. Yfh1p is a mitochondrial protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is involved in this homeostasis (4Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J.

At the cellular level, iron accumulation occurs in affected tissues in these patients, and iron proteins such as aconitase and cytochrome oxidase are deficient (6Rotig A. de Lonlay P. Chretien D.

The manner in which Yfh1p in the yeast (or frataxin in humans) affects iron homeostasis of mitochondria has not been defined. This work implicates a member of the class of Hsp70 proteins in this process. Two distinct Hsp70 proteins are found in mitochondria of S. cerevisiae (1Schilke B. Forster J. Davis J. James P.

Gene. 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), contained yeast genomic sequences from Chromosome XII, coordinates 858900-870300, and included open reading frames SUR4, ROM2, ARC18, andSSC2 (YLR369W). Plasmid pSC30-3, containing SSC2, was created by subcloning the EcoRI-KpnI genomic fragment. The plasmid pSC30-3Δnot contained a frameshift mutation in the open reading frame at the unique NotI site. For meiotic mapping, the EcoRI fragment from within ROM2inserted into YIp5 (prom2-YIp5) was integrated into CM3260 at its unique SacI site, and this strain was crossed with 35-5B (ssc2-1). The YFH1 open reading frame was inserted into the NdeI-XhoI sites of vector pET21b (Novagen), or into the NdeI-KpnI sites of vector pET21b/CCHL-Protein A, 2D. Pain, unpublished data. creating plasmids 446 and 436, respectively. The present investigation was an outgrowth of our general interest in iron trafficking in S. cerevisiae. Yeast cells were subjected to a selection procedure designed to detect mutants with abnormal iron metabolism. The iron-repressible promoter of theFRE1 gene was fused to the HIS3 coding region and integrated into the genome of a haploid yeast strain. Cells harboring this gene fusion were then cultured in a medium supplemented with iron but without histidine. Mutants were selected that were unable to repress FRE1-driven gene transcription, indicating a defect in iron uptake (15Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Elde D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), iron sensing (22Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), or iron distribution. A subset of these mutants was identified that was unable to grow on medium containing ethanol as a carbon source, an indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction. One such mutant, 35-5B, was chosen for further study. The mutant retained ferric reductase activity under conditions (available iron and copper) that led to repressed activity in the wild-type. This assay, used to track the mutation in genetic analyses, indicated that the mutant phenotype was recessive. Sporulation of this diploid strain which yielded 30 tetrads showing 2+:2−segregation of the mutant phenotype indicated that the mutation was at a single locus. The mutant was then transformed with a genomic library, and a complementing plasmid pSC30 was isolated (21Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene. 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The complementing activity was retained by pSC30-3 which contained the single complete open reading frame from SSC2, and this activity was abrogated by the frameshift mutation introduced into pSC30-3Δnot. Rescue of the ssc2-1 allele and sequence analysis identified a single T to G point mutation at nucleotide 658 within the open reading frame, thereby generating a stop codon within the amino-terminal portion of the predicted protein. The correctness of the identification of SSC2 as the wild-type allele of the mutation in the 35-5B strain was further verified by meiotic mapping. AURA3 marked allele of the genomic fragment carried on pSC30 was integrated into the parental strain and crossed with theura3-52 mutant strain 35-5B. Recombination between the mutant phenotype and the URA3 marker was not observed in 12 tetrads analyzed. To evaluate mitochondrial function in the ssc2-1strain, we investigated the growth of this strain on media with nonfermentable carbon sources. Heterogeneity arose because of loss or inactivation of mtDNA in some cells from the mutant population, as has previously been described for ssc2 mutants (1Schilke B. Forster J. Davis J. James P. Walter W. Laloraya S. Johnson J. Miao B. Craig E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The degree of mtDNA damage in the mutant population was ascertained by crossing haploid ssc2-1 mutant cells with rho0tester cells of the opposite mating type. Diploid clones derived from these zygotes were evaluated for the ability to grow on ethanol-based medium, and 8 of 18 (44%) did not grow (Fig. 1 A), indicating inactivation of mtDNA in those cells. Slow growth of ssc2 mutants was reflected in the small colony size (Fig. 1 B), as has been described previously (1Schilke B. Forster J. Davis J. James P. Walter W. Laloraya S. Johnson J. Miao B. Craig E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The slow growth was exacerbated at lower (23 °C) or higher (37 °C) incubation temperatures, suggesting susceptibility of the mutants to environmental stresses (Fig. 1 B). A link to iron metabolism was anticipated because of the way the mutants were selected. When the ssc2-1 mutant tetrad clones, 191-36A and 191-36B, were spotted on plates containing the iron chelator ferrozine, normal growth was observed (Fig. 1 B). Conversely, growth of these mutants was inhibited in the presence of iron (Fig. 1 B), suggesting a toxic effect of the iron on cell proliferation or cell viability. This iron-sensitive growth was correlated with a marked increase in the rate of high affinity iron uptake in the mutants (Fig. 1 C). These observations show that the normal homeostatic regulation of cellular iron uptake was perturbed in the ssc2-1mutant. To directly assess the iron content of the mitochondria, cells from the wild-type, a congenic rho0 strain, and thessc2-1 mutant were cultured in media containing different concentrations of iron-55 radionuclide. Mitochondria were purified (17Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and the total radioactive iron content was evaluated. In the wild-type, mitochondrial iron content varied little with the different iron concentrations of the growth medium (Fig. 1 D, wild-type values 1.8 to 2.6 pmol/μg of protein). By contrast, thessc2-1 mutant strain accumulated iron within mitochondria in proportion to the iron content of the growth medium. When grown in 0.9, 1.8, or 5 μm55Fe-containing medium, the mutant accumulated 9.5, 29.4, or 107.2 pmol/μg of mitochondrial protein, respectively (Fig. 1 D). The rho0 strain did not exhibit comparable mitochondrial iron accumulation, and so the effect could not be ascribed to the absence of mtDNA. We wondered if the increased mitochondrial iron content in the mutant represented a primary problem or a consequence of the increased cellular iron uptake “spilling over” into the mitochondria. When the iron content of cellular fractions was analyzed, iron accumulation in the mutant was observed exclusively within the mitochondrial fraction. The post-mitochondrial supernatant, in fact, appeared moderately depleted of iron in the mutant compared with the wild-type strain (5.5 compared with 9.2 pmol/μg of protein). These results suggest that the increase in mitochondrial iron in the mutant was not a secondary effect resulting from increased cytosolic iron but rather a primary defect. The accumulation of iron in the ssc2-1 mutant mitochondria was so great that it was visible by electron microscopy. The mitochondria were packed with electron-dense material in over 50% of the cells (Fig. 2 A). The fact that the deposits indeed contained iron was confirmed by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The wild-type yeast strain contained no such iron deposits, and a congenic rho0 strain showed only rare deposits in less than 5% of cells, indicating that this appearance was specific for the ssc2-1 mutant. Under higher magnifications, the mitochondrial double membrane could be seen (arrow m, Fig. 2 B), and the iron deposits were evident within the mitochondrial matrix. The deposits were granular and discontinuous in appearance, as if separated by intramitochondrial cristae (Fig. 2, B and D). In some cells, the deposit-laden mitochondria were arrayed around the nucleus (Fig. 2 D). We conclude that a loss of homeostatic control in the ssc2-1 mutant leads to accumulation of vast quantities of iron as electron-dense bodies within the mitochondria. Some of the features described here for thessc2-1 mutant have been reported for yeast with mutation in yfh1. Therefore, we compared the two mutant strains directly. Both were slow growing and exhibited frequent destabilization or inactivation of the mitochondrial genome (4Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 7Wilson R.B. Roof D.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Both retained ferric reductase activity under conditions that repress activity in the wild-type. Both exhibited elevated levels of high affinity iron uptake (354 pmol/106 cells/h for thessc2-1 mutant and 464 for the yfh1mutant, compared with 17 for the wild-type). Most striking was that both mutants exhibited increased mitochondrial iron content (107 pmol of iron/μg of protein for the ssc2-1 mutant and 47 for the yfh1 mutant, compared with 2.6 for the wild-type). The increased iron within mitochondria in both strains occurred without an increase in cytosolic iron (2.2 pmol of iron/μg of protein for the ssc2-1 mutant and 1.2 for theyfh1 mutant compared with 3.0 for the wild-type). Thus, thessc2-1 and yfh1 mutants strongly resemble each other with respect to their mutant phenotypes. The similar phenotypes of ssc2-1 andyfh1 mutants suggested that the corresponding proteins might function together. We therefore considered that Ssc2p might function specifically in the import or folding of Yfh1p, analogous to the known effects of Ssc1p on import and folding of other mitochondrial preproteins. To test this hypothesis, mitochondria were isolated from the wild-type (WT) and ssc2-1 mutant (M) strains, and the import of Yfh1 preprotein was allowed to proceed, after which the unimported precursor was removed by digestion with trypsin. Two new fragments (i and m) acquired trypsin resistance, suggesting that the import of Yfh1 preprotein was followed by two processing cleavages (Fig. 3 A). The Yfh1 preprotein (p) migrated at a molecular mass ∼29 kDa, although the predicted size was only 19.5 kDa, perhaps because of the acidic nature of the protein. The initial processing cleavage removed ∼2 kDa from the amino terminus of the preprotein and generated an intermediate size polypeptide (i) migrating at ∼27 kDa. A subsequent cleavage removed ∼4 kDa from the amino terminus of the intermediate form, generating a mature product (m) of ∼23 kDa that was also trypsin-resistant (Fig. 3 A). In thessc2-1 mutant, by contrast, import of Yfh1 preprotein was efficient as judged by the appearance of the protease-resistant intermediate polypeptide (i), but the conversion to the mature form was impaired. After 5 min of incubation, the level of the mature form was decreased compared with the wild-type (Fig. 3 A, m in lanes 2,3, 4, and 5), whereas the level of the intermediate form of Yfh1 was increased compared with the wild-type (Fig. 3 A, i in lanes 2,3, 4, and 5). Import studies of the preYfh1-Protein A fusion similarly generated two protease-resistant polypeptide forms, differing from the precursor by ∼2 and ∼6 kDa (Fig. 3 B). This experiment also demonstrated that the proteolytic processing steps must be occurring at the amino terminus of the Yfh1 preprotein, because Yfh1 and Yfh1-Protein A precursors were processed identically. The level of the mature Yfh1-Protein A fusion protein (m) was again decreased in the ssc2-1 strain (M) compared with the wild-type (WT) (Fig. 3 B,m in lanes 2, 3,4, and 5). A reciprocal increase in the intermediate form was noted in the early (5 min) time point in the mutant, consistent with an inefficient second processing step (Fig. 3 B, i in lanes 2,3, 4, and 5). We also studied the import of prePut2 (20Sepuri N.B.V. Schulke N. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1420-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the precursor of a mitochondrial matrix protein involved in proline biosynthesis, and in this case, no difference in the appearance of protease-protected forms was observed in thessc2-1 mutant compared with the wild-type (Fig. 3 C). Consistent with our prePut2 control, earlier studies failed to demonstrate alterations in the import or processing of several other preproteins by mitochondria isolated from ssc2mutant strains (1Schilke B. Forster J. Davis J. James P. Walter W. Laloraya S. Johnson J. Miao B. Craig E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the defect in preprotein processing that exists in the ssc2-1 strain is specific for the Yfh1 preprotein. We present the following model to explain these findings (Fig. 4). i) The primary defect in thessc2-1 mutant leads to impaired maturation of Yfh1p (yellow in Fig. 4). ii) In thessc2-1 mutant, iron uptake into the mitochondria is greatly increased, reducing cytoplasmic iron concentrations. The iron sensor-regulator, Aft1p, which ordinarily does not affect mitochondrial iron levels, responds to the decreased cytoplasmic iron by activation of the cellular iron uptake system (blue in Fig. 4) (22Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Thus, iron is continually fed from the medium to the cytoplasm to the mitochondria (red in Fig. 4). The iron accumulates as dense bodies in the mitochondria that are visible by electron microscopy. iii) Despite the excess iron, the activities of a number of mitochondrial iron proteins are decreased (e.g. inyfh1 mutants, respiratory chain complexes I, II, III, IV, and the iron-sulfur protein, aconitase (5Foury F. Cazzalini O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 6Rotig A. de Lonlay P. Chretien D. Foury F. Koenig M. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar)). In this model, Ssc2p is required for the generation of mature Yfh1p, thereby regulating iron usage and assembly of iron proteins within the mitochondria. A direct role for Ssc2p in these processes is also possible. We have shown that Ssc2p participates in the second processing cleavage of Yfh1 following an initial cleavage of the extreme amino-terminal signal sequence. To do this, Ssc2p might itself be acting as the processing protease. The association of proteolytic and chaperone activities in a single complex has been described for mitochondrial proteins such as Lon (23Rep M. van Dijl J.M. Suda K. Schatz G. Grivell L.A. Suzuki C.K. Science. 1996; 274: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and Afg3p and Rca1p (24Langer T. Neupert W. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Ssc2p could mediate maturation of Yfh1 preprotein indirectly via effects on folding or complex formation. The iron-sulfur protein of the cytochrome bc 1 complex provides an example of an association between preprotein assembly and two-step proteolytic processing. The iron-sulfur preprotein is imported into the matrix, and the signal sequence is cleaved by the matrix processing peptidase. A second processing cleavage by the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase then occurs upon assembly of the mature protein into complex II of the mitochondrial inner membrane (25Graham L.A. Brandt U. Sargent J.S. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In analogous fashion, Ssc2p might mediate processing and insertion of Yfh1p into a complex. However, physical interaction between Yfh1p and Ssc2p has not yet been demonstrated, and assembly partners for Yfh1p are not known. Ssc2p function is necessary for normal iron homeostasis, and defects of Ssc2p are correlated with iron accumulation within the mitochondria. This may result from increased activity of mitochondrial iron importers or decreased activity of exporters. Another possibility is that diversion of iron into an inactive or inaccessible form induces increased iron import into mitochondria, causing the massive accumulations that we have observed. The iron, like intermediates in some storage diseases (26), may accumulate in a metabolic dead end, causing deficiencies of iron proteins and iron-protein complexes (5Foury F. Cazzalini O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar,6Rotig A. de Lonlay P. Chretien D. Foury F. Koenig M. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Ssc2p, through its effects on the maturation and assembly of Yfh1 and other proteins, might regulate this iron accumulation process. Yfh1p is homologous to the human protein frataxin, which is defective in most cases of the neurodegenerative disease Friedreich's ataxia (4Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S.

Rodius F. Duclos F. Monticelli A. et al.Science. 1996; 271: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (2302) Google Scholar). Specialized Hsp70 proteins within different cellular compartments are also conserved between yeast and humans (e.g. BiP in the endoplasmic reticulum and mt-Hsp70 in the mitochondria (10)). Therefore, in humans, a specialized mitochondrial form of Hsp70, analogous to Ssc2p, is likely to be involved in the maturation of human frataxin. Our inability to identify such a homolog in the human sequence data bases at this time may relate to the incomplete nature of these data bases and the low abundance of the transcript. The human homolog of Ssc2p might be defective in forms of Friedreich's ataxia that are not explained by frataxin mutations (27) or in other neurodegenerative diseases with a mitochondrial basis.

The uPAR is a highly glycosylated 55-kDa protein linked to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The receptor-binding domain of uPA is located in the amino-terminal fragment (ATF; residues 1–135) of the uPA molecule and does not involve the protease domain (for a review, see Ref. 3Conese M. Blasi F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 143-155PubMed Google Scholar). Independently of its proteolytic activity, uPA has been shown to induce the adhesion and chemotactic movement of myeloid cells (4Waltz D.A. Sailor L.Z. Chapman H.A. J. Clin.

These latter functions are related to the occupancy of the uPAR, which is mediated by the receptor-binding domain of uPA (3Conese M. Blasi F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 143-155PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced endothelial cell migration by uPA is independent of its proteolytic activity (7Odekon L.E. Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell.

Although devoid of membrane-spanning and intracellular domains characteristic of the G protein-coupled and tyrosine kinase receptor families (9Ploug M. Ronne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Dano K. J. Biol.

Petri T. Schleuning W.D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), diacylglycerol formation (11Del Rosso M. Anichini E. Pedersen N. Blasi F. Fibbi G. Pucci M.

J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In the human kidney epithelial tumor cell line TCL-598, the uPAR was associated with activation of the JAK1/STAT1 signaling pathway (12Koshelnick Y. Ehart M. Hufnagl P. Heinrich P.C. Binder B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28563-28567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A similar involvement of the JAK/STAT pathway was demonstrated for vascular smooth muscle cells (13Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that members of the Src kinase family and β2-integrins are components of the uPAR complex (14Bohuslav J. Horejsi V. Hansmann C. Stockl J. Weidle U.H. Majdic O. Bartke I. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Further confirmation of the ability of the uPAR to form a complex with members of the integrin family was provided by the observation that the leukocyte β2-integrin Mac-1 (CR3) forms a unit with the uPAR on monocytes (15Simon D.I. Rao N.K. Xu H. Wei Y. Majdic O. Ronne E. Kobzik L. Chapman H.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3185-3194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly of these molecules in one receptor (uPAR) complex suggests the possibility of functional cooperation. Such a degree of functional cooperation was recently demonstrated for the uPAR and vitronectin (16Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar); formation of a uPAR-integrin-caveolin complex resulted in inhibition of β1-integrin-dependent adhesion to fibronectin. However, the intracellular signaling events triggered by occupancy of the uPAR that lead to effects on cellular migration and adhesion are not well characterized. Recent studies have identified a novel intracellular protein-tyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), that is involved in cell adhesion and/or migration (17Illc D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). FAK is localized in focal adhesion contacts and becomes rapidly phosphorylated and activated upon coupling of integrins to the extracellular matrix or integrin clustering (18Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). Additionally, FAK acts in concert with paxillin to localize several SH2 domain-containing proteins, including Src, Fyn, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the carboxyl-terminal Src kinase in focal adhesion contacts (18Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). Moreover, an association between FAK and Grb2 has been reported, suggesting a role for FAK in connecting integrin ligand binding to downstream signaling pathways, such as activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (19Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). The focal adhesion-related protein p130cas has recently been identified as a novel SH3 domain-containing signaling molecule with a cluster of multiple putative SH2 domain-binding motifs (20Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The unique structure of p130cas indicates the possible role of p130cas in assembling signals from multiple SH2 domain-containing molecules, including Src and Crk. Additionally, it has been shown that paxillin is a substrate for FAK kinase activity in vitro and in vivo (21Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar,22Turner C.E. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 637-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similarities between the functional effects of uPAR occupancy and FAK activation prompted us to examine the effects of uPA on endothelial tyrosine phosphorylation and specifically to characterize the effects of uPA on FAK and MAPK activation in cultured endothelial cells. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for the uPAR in endothelial cell signal transduction that involves the activation of FAK and MAPK, which may explain how uPA influences cells migration and differentiation. All reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and polyclonal and monoclonal anti-FAK (2A7) antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The monoclonal anti-paxillin and anti-p130cas antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Genistein and PP1 were obtained from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibody against the uPAR (mAb 3936), recombinant human uPA, recombinant human ATF, and low molecular mass uPA were obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Protein A-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Chemiluminescent detection of Western blots was performed using kits obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. The PhosphoPlusTM MAPK antibody kit was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). BAE cells were obtained from fresh bovine aortas and harvested using 0.1% collagenase as described previously (23Vaughan D.E. Lazos S.A. Tong K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Cells of passage 1 were exclusively used in these experiments. BAE cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated for 2 days in serum-free medium. For measuring MAPK, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 2 h prior to the experiment. In a preliminary set of experiments, we found that >4 h of serum depletion resulted in a decrease in uPA-induced activation of MAPK without any apparent change in the phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins (data not shown). The cells were stimulated with uPA or ATF at the indicated time periods or concentrations in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The incubation was terminated by rapid aspiration of the medium, followed by washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and then lysed on ice in 0.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 10 min, and equal amounts (1 mg) of lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibody overnight, followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, solubilized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to membranes. The blocked membranes were then incubated with the indicated antibody, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescent reagents as recommended by the manufacturer. Due to the high affinity of the monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody, a dilution of 1:10,000 was utilized. Activation of MAPK occurs through phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine at the sequence T*EY* by a single upstream MAPK kinase (24Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). BAE cells were cultured in 6-well plates and used at subconfluence. Equal amounts of cell lysates (50 μg) were directly electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blocked membranes were then incubated with a phospho-specific MAPK antibody that detects p42 MAPK and p44 MAPK only when catalytically activated by phosphorylation at Tyr-204. The phospho-specific MAPK antibody reacts equally well with Thr/Tyr-doubly phosphorylated MAPK. The membrane was stripped in β-mercaptoethanol stripping buffer at 60 °C for 30 min (25Tesfaigzi J. Smith-Harrison W. Carlson D.M. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 268-269PubMed Google Scholar) and reprobed with p44/p42 MAPK antibody, which detects total MAPK protein, as a control for sample variations. Immune complexes were detected by the chemiluminescent Western detection system as recommended by the manufacturer. Rhodamine-phalloidin (R-415) was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) and stained according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, BAE cells were grown to 70% confluence on coverslips. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS, and again washed with PBS. The coverslips were placed in a glass Petri dish and extracted with acetone at –20 °C, washed with PBS, and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin for 20 min (26Barak L.S. Yocum R.R. Nothnagel E.A. Webb W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). To investigate tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in response to uPA occupation of the uPAR, BAE cells were incubated with 50 nm uPA, ATF, or a low molecular weight uPA for the indicated time periods and lysed. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with the same anti-Tyr(P) mAb. As shown in Fig. 1, uPA induced an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins including bands of 120–130 and 70–80 kDa. The stimulatory effect was rapid and reached its maximum at 1 min and then declined after 5 min of treatment with uPA, but remained higher than the basal level. Incubation with ATF (50 nm), an amino-terminal fragment of uPA, mimicked the effects of uPA. In contrast, low molecular weight uPA, which contains the protease domain but lacks the receptor-binding domain of uPA, had no effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). The phosphorylation of bands in the 70–80- and 120–130-kDa range did not represent a nonspecific response as these bands were not observed following immunoprecipitation with a nonspecific mouse IgG (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the uPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by the receptor-binding domain of uPA. To determine whether FAK is activated following occupancy of the uPAR, samples from uPA-treated BAE cells were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-FAK antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) mAb (Fig. 2). Urokinase induced a dose- and time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. Tyrosine phosphorylation was maximal at a uPA concentration of 50 nm in this system (Fig. 2 A). Pretreatment of the cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which cleaves GPI-linked proteins from the cell surface, blocked the effect of uPA (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of cells with cytochalasin D, which disrupts the network of actin microfilaments, prevented the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 2 B). The apparent specific phosphorylation of FAK in response to uPA binding prompted further experiments to determine whether other focal adhesion-related proteins were involved in this process. As shown in Fig. 3, uPA induced time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and p130cas. The maximum effect of uPA was achieved at 5 min with 50 nm uPA. The tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and p130cas coincides with tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. Additional experiments were performed using ATF to confirm that this uPAR-binding fragment of uPA is fully capable of inducing FAK activation. As shown in Fig. 4, ATF (50 nm) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin, and p130cas in a pattern similar to that observed with uPA. These results strongly suggest that the action of uPA on the signal transduction to focal adhesion is mediated by the receptor-binding domain of uPA, but independent of its catalytic domain. We next examined the effects of uPA on the activation of MAPK in cultured endothelial cells. Cell lysates of BAE cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with phospho-specific MAPK antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A, both uPA and ATF (50 nm) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK and p44 MAPK, with maximal induction present at 10 min. The phosphorylation of p42 MAPK and p44 MAPK by uPA and ATF was not due to the alteration in the amount of MAPK protein (Fig. 5 A). Diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated uPA, with no detectable amidolytic activity, also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 MAPK and p44 MAPK (data not shown). The uPA-induced activation of MAPK was completely inhibited by the treatment of BAE cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (Fig. 5 B), suggesting a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway for the activation of MAPK by the uPAR. Furthermore, cytochalasin D, which abolished the activation of FAK in this study, also resulted in a decreased activation of MAPK (data not shown), indicating a role for cytoskeletal architecture in this response. To address the role played by members of the Src kinase family of tyrosine kinases in the activation of MAPK, the effects of the specific inhibitor PP1 (27Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar) were examined. PP1 resulted in a decrease in MAPK activity at the base line (Fig. 6); however, despite the presence of PP1, uPA stimulation continued to result in activation of MAPK. Moreover, another Src family kinase inhibitor, herbimycin (28Park D.J. Min H.K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24237-24240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not affect the activation of MAPK by uPA treatment (data not shown). The results of these experiments indicate that uPA results in the activation of MAPK by a pathway that may involve the cytoskeleton, but not Src kinase activation.Figure 6Effect of PP1 on the activation of MAPK by uPA. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were stimulated with 50 nm uPA for the indicated times in the absence (lanes 1–3) or presence (lanes 4–6) of pretreatment (5 μm for 45 min) and then immunoblotted (IB) with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (upper panel). The stripped membrane were reprobed with anti-p44/p42 MAPK antibody (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of uPA exposure on cytoskeletal arrangement were determined by staining with rhodamine-phalloidin. The cells were exposed to uPA (50 nm) for varying time intervals. Exposure to uPA resulted in a progressive alteration in the distribution of actin (Fig. 7). Control cells typically contained a fine complex of microfilaments with the presence of a more dense peripheral band at the margins of the cells. Following exposure to uPA, peripheral bands became thinner, whereas the number of cytoplasmic stress fibers was increased (Fig. 7). The uPAR has been clearly identified and characterized in human (29Mignatti P. Mazzieri R. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and bovine (30Reuning U. Bang N.U. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) vascular endothelia. Urokinase has recently been shown to induce cell chemotaxis, cell adhesion/migration, and cell growth. These effects appear to be mediated by the receptor-binding domain of uPA and can occur in the absence of catalytic activity (4Waltz D.A. Sailor L.Z. Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1541-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Gyetko M.R. Todd III, R.F. Wilkinson C.C. Sitrin R.G. J. Clin.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14151-14156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of uPA by migrating cells at the edge of wounded monolayers and at focal adhesion plaques has been described in keratinocytes (31McNeill H. Jensen P.J. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), fibroblasts (32Pollanen J. Hedman K. Nielsen L.S. Dano K. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and endothelial cells (33Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.D. Montesano R. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2535-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, uPAR occupancy by uPA restricts receptor distribution to focal contacts, whereas unoccupied uPARs remain mobile in the plane of the plasma membrane (34Myohanen H.T. Stephens R.W. Hedman K. Tapiovaara H. Ronne E. Hoyer-Hansen G. Dano K. Vaheri A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In adherent monocytes exposed to a chemotactic gradient, the uPAR and uPA became highly concentrated at the leading edge of migration (5Gyetko M.R. Todd III, R.F. Wilkinson C.C. Sitrin R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, uPA-induced cell migration is time- and concentration-dependent and does not involve extracellular proteolysis (6Busso N. Masur S.K. Lazega D. Waxman S. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that uPA binding to the uPAR induces a signaling event that leads to an alteration in cell function. Recent studies have demonstrated that a novel non-receptor tyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase, is involved in cell adhesion and migration (17Illc D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). The mobility of cells from FAK-deficient mice has been reported to be impaired, whereas the number of focal adhesion contacts is increased, indicating that FAK may contribute to the turnover of focal adhesion contacts during cell migration (17Illc D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Using BAE cells, we have demonstrated that either uPA or ATF results in the activation of FAK, paxillin, and p130cas. This activation pattern suggests that occupation of the uPAR by uPA facilitates adhesion signaling events and may promote cell migration by increasing the turnover of focal contacts. These data are consistent with previous observations that uPA-induced monocyte adhesion is dependent upon gene expression and protein synthesis (35Li C. Liu J.-N. Gurewich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30282-30285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Since the uPAR belongs to the family of GPI-anchored membrane proteins that lack transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, it is unlikely that it can interact directly with FAK, paxillin, or p130cas, which are cytosolic proteins localized in focal adhesions (18Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). Indeed, we did not observe the presence of FAK or p130cas by immunoblotting uPAR immunoprecipitates from unstimulated or uPA-stimulated BAE cells (data not shown). Furthermore, several actin-binding proteins have been identified that co-localize with integrins in focal adhesions, including α-actinin, vinculin, and tensin. Talin and α-actinin bind to integrin cytoplasmic domains in vitro. Lewis and Schwartz (36Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have recently described co-localization of talin, FAK, and actinin vivo using microbeads coated with anti-integrin antibodies. Chen et al. (37Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16995-16999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) reported that FAK associated with talin through a 48-amino acid sequence in its carboxyl-terminal domain. The uPAR is known to co-localize with the cytoskeletal components vinculin, α-actinin, and actin at sites of contact between cells and extracellular matrix (38Takahashi K. Ikeo K. Gojobori T. Tanifuji M. Thromb. Res. 1990; 10: 55-61Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, treatment of BAE cells with an inhibitor of cytoskeleton assembly, cytochalasin D, abolished the uPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that a functional linkage between the cytoskeleton and the uPAR is required for uPA-induced FAK activation. Since the uPAR has been localized to caveolae (39Stahl A. Mueller B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which play an important role in the incorporation of proteins by the cell membrane and their intracellular uptake (40Anderson R.G. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and a functional unit of the uPAR, integrins, and caveolin regulates integrin function (16Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), this linkage is not surprising. We speculate that the uPAR and cytoskeleton proteins, possibly vinculin or actinin, are bridged by at least one partner protein that contains a transmembrane segment, probably an integrin. Indeed, it has recently been shown that the uPAR is associated with the integrin Mac-1 within one receptor complex in human monocytes (15Simon D.I. Rao N.K. Xu H. Wei Y. Majdic O. Ronne E. Kobzik L. Chapman H.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3185-3194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, uPA and the uPAR are co-localized with the vitronectin receptor (αvβ3-integrin) (3Conese M. Blasi F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 143-155PubMed Google Scholar). A cooperative interaction between the uPAR and the vitronectin receptor has been reported, and transient expression of the uPAR in the human 293 cell, an embryonic kidney cell line, resulted in specific binding of vitronectin (41Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this binding was enhanced in the presence of uPA (41Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but was blocked by a chimeric protein composed of β1-integrin transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains fused with the extracellular domain of CD4 (16Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that the binding of uPA to the uPAR induces clustering of the uPAR to focal adhesions, where it transduces its signal by activating FAK, paxillin, and p130cas through the cooperation of integrins and, in turn, promotes cell migration by increasing the turnover of focal adhesion contacts. There are other precedents for such a mechanism for signal transduction involving GPI-linked proteins, such as Ly-6, CD59, and CD55 (42Stefanova I. Horejsi V. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1587-1592PubMed Google Scholar, 43Stefanova I. Horejsi V. Ansotegui I.J. Knapp W. Stockinger H. Science. 1991; 254: 1016-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). More recently, Laudanna et al. (44Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) reported that G protein-linked receptors of the chemoattractant subfamily can trigger adhesion through leukocyte integrins. The pathway through which uPAR occupancy stimulates gene expression is not well understood. FAK has been reported to associate with the Grb2 adapter protein (19Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Since Grb2 is linked to Ras via the Sos protein, FAK activation is linked to a well established mitogenesis pathway. Cytochalasin D treatment has been shown to prevent MAPK phosphorylation (45Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and integrin-mediated activation of FAK (46Bockholt S.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14565-14567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that occupancy of the uPAR caused both activation of MAPK and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. The phosphorylation of FAK was apparent at an earlier time point than that of MAPK. The uPA-induced activation of MAPK was inhibited by genistein, but not by PP1 or herbimycin, suggesting the involvement of a non-Src tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway. Furthermore, our preliminary data (not shown) indicated that cytochalasin D can decrease uPA-induced activation of MAPK in BAE cells. Although our current data do not directly address the potential relationship between FAK and MAPK in the uPAR system, these results suggest that they may be part of the same signaling pathway. MAPK is thought to play a key role in conveying signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, triggering gene expression. Thus, this study suggests that uPA-induced activation of MAPK may trigger the expression of cytoskeletal or cell-surface components that mediate the well established effects of uPA on cell migration. In summary, these experiments demonstrate a role for the endothelial uPAR in the transduction of signals resulting from occupancy by the cognate ligand. They show that the catalytic domain of uPA is not involved in these responses. The uPAR appears to play a novel role in endothelial cell signal transduction through a mechanism that involves the activation of FAK and MAPK. These findings may have significant implications for the mechanism through which uPA influences cell migration and differentiation."

Members of the TGF-β superfamily regulate the growth and differentiation of multiple cell types and the homeostasis of extracellular proteolysis. They also have important roles in different stages of development (reviewed in Refs. 1Massagué J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

TGF-βs remain biologically latent after secretion. The activity of the mature TGF-β dimer is blocked by its amino-terminal propeptide (LAP), which is cleaved apart from the mature TGF-β during secretion, but remains associated with TGF-β by non-covalent interactions. TGF-β is activated by its dissociation from LAP, which can be accomplished for example by proteolysis (reviewed in Ref. 3Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). In most cell types studied, including those of mesenchymal, epithelial, and endothelial origin, TGF-β is secreted in a latent form associated with latent TGF-β-binding protein (LTBP; Ref. 5Taipale J. Lohi J. Saarinen J. Kovanen P. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4689-4696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). LTBPs are also needed for the secretion and folding of TGF-β (6Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 7Miyazono K.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3193-3197PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of all the members of the TGF-β superfamily is under strict control during developmental and pathological processes. Targeted deposition to extracellular structures via association with binding proteins, like LTBPs, would provide means to control the spatial activity of these growth factors. Currently three different LTBPs have been cloned from mammals (LTBPs 1–3) and found to form the covalent association with TGF-β1·LAP (9Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Morén A. Wernstedt C.

LTBP-1 and -2 are assembled into ECM rapidly after secretion (14Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Keski-Oja J. J.

LTBPs have a high degree of similarity to ECM microfibril proteins called fibrillins 1 and 2 (17Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 18Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies, LTBP-1 and LTBP-2 have been found to associate with microfibrils (13Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Davis E.C. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Mecham R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6932-6942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Taipale J. Saharinen J. Hedman K. Keski-Oja J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) similar to those previously shown to contain fibrillins. LTBP-1 and -2 are released from the extracellular matrix by various proteinases including plasmin, leukocyte elastase, and mast cell chymase (20Taipale J. Koli K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25378-25384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Benezra M. Vlodavskyl I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Neufeld G. Bar-Shavit R.

TGF-β, thus accumulates in the microfibrillar ECM structures in a latent form, where it can be released. The released large TGF-β complex is still latent, unless a high concentration of plasmin is used (5Taipale J. Lohi J. Saarinen J. Kovanen P. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4689-4696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 22Lyons R. Keski-Oja J. Moses H. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). The released complex is then most likely activated at the cell surface (23Sato Y. Okada F. Abe M. Seguchi T. Kuwano M.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). LTBPs are mainly composed of EGF-like repeats and protein domains with conserved patterns of eight cysteine residues, called 8-cysteine repeats. The association between LTBP-1 and the LAP part of TGF-β1 is mediated by a disulfide bond between Cys-33 of LAP and a yet unidentified cysteine in the 3rd 8-Cys repeat of LTBP-1 (15Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 25Gleizes P.E. Beavis R.C. Mazzieri R. Shen B. Rifkin D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29891-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), providing a biological function for the 8-Cys protein domains. The 8-Cys repeats have been found only in five proteins, LTBPs 1–3, and fibrillins 1 and 2. The current study was carried out to find novel proteins containing the 8-Cys repeats that would possibly interact with members of the TGF-β superfamily and extracellular microfibrils. Through an EST data bank search we found a sequence for a new 8-Cys repeat containing protein. By using this sequence as a probe, we cloned a novel cDNA for a protein with high similarity to known LTBPs and named it LTBP-4. We report here the cloning of human LTBP-4S as well as three other alternative forms of it. LTBP-4 is deposited to the extracellular matrix and has an ability to form complexes of high molecular weight with heterologous TGF-β-like proteins. Pfu and AmpliTaqthermostable DNA-polymerases were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and Perkin-Elmer, respectively. All other molecular biology enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Plasmin was purchased from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden). The proteinases porcine pancreatic elastase, bovine spleen cathepsin B and D, human leukocyte elastase, and human cathepsin G were from Sigma. Human mast cell chymase was a kind gift from Drs. Jussi Saarinen and Petri Kovanen (Wihuri Research Institute, Helsinki, Finland). The chymase was purified to 99% homogeneity from human skin as described (26Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Welgus H.G. Kovanen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18134-18140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Glycosidase F was from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). SV40-transformed human kidney epithelial cells (293-T, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) and human embryonic lung fibroblasts (CCL-137, ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All experiments were carried out under serum-free conditions. For the collection of conditioned medium, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, and the subsequently added serum-free medium was collected after specified periods. CHO cell clones overexpressing human LTBP-1 (15Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and LTBP-2 (45Hyytiäinen M. Taipale J. Heldin C.-H. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) have been described elsewhere. Antibodies against human LTBP-1 and LTBP-2 were kind gifts of Dr. C.-H. Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). Affinity purified rabbit anti-human TGF-β1·LAP antibodies (number 680) have been described previously (14Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). For the generation of LTBP-4-specific antibodies, synthetic peptides derived from LTBP-4 sequence at the beginning of the 3rd (YFDTAAPDACDNILARNVTWQE) and 4th (WQEVGADLVCSHPRLDRQATY-TE) 8-Cys repeats (see Fig. 2 A), respectively, were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). The keyhole limpet hemocyanin-peptide complexes were used to raise antibodies 28-3 (against the 3rd 8-Cys repeat) and 33-4 (against the 4th 8-Cys repeat) in rabbits. Subsequently, the antibodies were affinity purified with the antigenic peptide. Both Ab 28-3 and Ab 33-4 were reactive in immunoblotting assays under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. cDNA for human LTBP-4 was cloned from two human heart cDNA libraries, obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Library HL3005q is poly(T)-primed pCDM-8 plasmid library, and library HL3026a is both poly(T)- and random-primed λ gt10 phage library. Libraries were first screened using EST clone 302831 as a probe (see Fig. 1 A). Cloning was carried out essentially as described (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Overlapping cDNA clones were sequenced using ALF Express from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden) and ABI 373, ABI 377, and ABI 310 automatic DNA sequencers from Perkin-Elmer. The contig was assembled by the aid of Gap4 program in the Staden software package (28Bonfield J.K. Smith K.F. Staden R.

The full-length LTBP-4 was subsequently removed from pBluescript II as an EcoRI fragment and inserted into pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), generating construct pLTBP-4. Construct pTGFβ and pLTBP-1 contained the full-length cDNA for human TGF-β1 and human LTBP-1S, respectively, as described earlier (15Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A 3′ NotI fragment (nucleotides 3589–4808) or anAgeI–NotI fragment (nucleotides 2826–3588) of LTBP-4 cDNA was used as a probe in Northern and RNA master blot hybridizations. The fragments were [32P]dCTP-labeled using random priming kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In multitissue Northern blots, β-actin probe was used as a control. Hybridization of both multitissue and RNA master blots were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). The amounts of RNA in RNA master blot have been equalized by the manufacturer by comparing the expression levels of eight different housekeeping mRNAs. Radioactivity levels in hybridized RNA master blots were quantitated with a BAS-1500 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). The 293T cells were seeded in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and transfected the following day as 70% confluent with 10 μg of the plasmids indicated. Transfections were carried out using a calcium phosphate transfection system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. The day after transfection, the cells were washed twice and fed with serum-free medium, and the conditioned medium was collected after 48 h. Extracellular matrices were prepared according to Hedman et al. (29Hedman K. Kurkinen M. Alitalo K. Vaheri A. Johansson S. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell cultures were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (0.14m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and then treated three times with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 0 °C for 10 min. The plates were then washed again with phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. Cross-linked components of the matrix were partially solubilized by digesting the sodium deoxycholate-insoluble matrices by plasmin (0.3 caseinolytic units/ml) in matrix digestion buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, and 0.1% n-octyl-d-β-glycopyranoside) at 37 °C for 1 h (14Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Finally, released ECM proteins were dissolved in nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was carried out using commercial 4–15% gradient or 7.5% standard Laemmli gels (Bio-Rad). The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were subsequently treated at 80 °C for 2 h in order to fix the proteins. Immunodetection was performed as described (15Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium from confluent fibroblasts was collected for 3 days under serum-free conditions. Aliquots of the medium were treated with proteinases at 37 °C for 1 h. The following concentrations of proteinases were used: 50 nmplasmin; 10 nm chymase; 10 nm leukocyte elastase; 10 nm porcine pancreatic elastase; 100 nm cathepsin G; 500 nm cathepsin G; 500 nm cathepsin D (see Ref. 5Taipale J. Lohi J. Saarinen J. Kovanen P. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4689-4696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Zoo Southern blot (CLONTECH) contained 4 μg ofEcoRI-digested genomic DNA from various species. The Zoo blot was hybridized using [32P]dCTP-labeled clone 1.1.1 A as a probe and washed first with 1× SSC, 0,1% SDS and subsequently with 0.1× SSC, 0,1% SDS at 42 °C. A 3′ NotI fragment (nucleotides 3589–4808) of LTBP-4 cDNA was used as a probe to clone the genomic DNA from a human genomic PAC library (Genome Systems Inc, St. Louis, MO). The PAC clone was further verified by amplifying an approximately 1.5-kilobase pair fragment with polymerase chain reaction using primers specific to LTBP-4 cDNA. The polymerase chain reaction product was sequenced and found to containLTBP-4 exons and introns. The obtained PAC clone in vector pAd10SacBII was labeled with biotin-14-dATP by nick translation. The metaphase preparations made from human lymphocyte culture were pretreated with pepsin (0.2 mg/ml at 0.01 m HCl) for 10 min at 37 °C, and chromosomes were denatured in 70% formamide in 0.3m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0 (2× SSC) at 64 °C for 2 min. Hybridization signals were detected by avidin-tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate and analyzed by Olympus fluorescence microscope equipped with a ISIS digital image analysis system (Metasystems, Altlussheim, Germany). The chromosome identity was verified by painting with a chromosome-specific probe according to manufacturer's instructions (Cambio, Cambridge, UK). To determine whether there are yet unknown 8-Cys repeat containing proteins, we searched an expressed sequence tag (EST) subsection of the GenBankTM data bank (release 100.0, January 1997) against the 3rd 8-Cys repeat of human LTBP-1 protein sequence using TBLAST program (30Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). We obtained several overlapping clones with identical sequences of various lengths, whose deduced amino acid sequence contained an 8-Cys-like motif of an unknown protein. We used an EST clone 302831 (GenBank accession number W19505) as an initial probe to clone a homologous cDNA from human heart cDNA library. A large number of overlapping cDNA fragments were obtained, which were assembled to the full-length ORF sequence. Some of these cDNA fragments are depicted in Fig. 1 A. The new cDNA was named LTBP-4S. The LTBP-4S ORF is 4536 base pairs long, having a methionine codon in favorable context toward translational initiation (31Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar) at position 137. This initiator methionine is followed by a deduced signal peptide. The translated open reading frame codes for a protein of 1511 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 161 kDa and a pI of 4.76 containing five potentialN-glycosylation sites, an integrin-mediated cell attachment motif (RGD), and a putative glycosaminoglycan attachment site. In the LTBP-4S sequence, a total of 20 EGF-like and 3 8-Cys repeat sequences were found as well as a hybrid domain between an EGF-like and an 8-Cys repeat. Of the 20 EGF-like repeats, 17 contain the consensus sequence (D/N)X(D/N)(E/Q)Xn(D/N)Xm(Y/F), characteristic of a calcium binding type of an EGF-like repeat (see Fig. 2 A). LTBP-4S has 39–52% similarity to previously cloned human LTBP-1 and -2 and mouse LTBP-3 (Fig. 2 B). In domain structure, LTBP-4S, as all other LTBPs, is structurally related to fibrillin-1 and -2 (Fig. 2 A). In addition to LTBP-4S, we also obtained three different forms of LTBP-4 (see Fig. 1 A), which we named as LTBP-4L, LTBP-4Δ2E, and LTBP-4ΔE. LTBP-4S and LTBP-4L have different amino-terminal coding sequences, whereas LTBP-4Δ2E and LTBP-4ΔE code for LTBP-4 forms lacking one or two EGF-like repeats from the long stretch of EGF-like repeats (Fig. 2 A). LTBP-4L is a putative amino-terminally extended form of LTBP-4S. Only one of the four 5′-terminal clones encoded for LTBP-4L (clone D1-1 in Fig. 1 A). However, the obtained LTBP-4L ORF was not of full length, and therefore we were unable to clone the full-length LTBP-4L. The extended 5′ sequence of LTBP-4L obtained from clone D1-1 codes for eight cysteine residues, which are, however, not in the characteristic order C—C—CCC—C—C—C as the other 8-Cys repeats in LTBPs and fibrillins (Fig. 3 A). After this cysteine-rich region, there is a high local concentration of proline and arginine sequences, implying potential protease-sensitive hinge region (see “Processing of LTBP-4 by Proteinases,” below). Also a motif PSPSPS is repeated twice in the LTBP-4L coding D1-1 fragment. After full sequencing of the clones 14.1.1 and EST 302831, the two other alternative splices in the central part of LTBP-4 cDNA were found. The form of LTBP-4 cDNA coded by the clone 14.1.1, and named as LTBP-4ΔEGF, lacked the 14th EGF-like repeat, which is 3rd from the carboxyl-terminal end of the long stretch of EGF-like repeats (amino acids 892–935, corresponding to LTBP-4S) (Fig. 3 B). LTBP-4Δ2EGF clone coded by EST 302831 lacked the 14th and 15th EGF-like repeats (amino acids 892–977) (Fig. 3 B). By using a NotI fragment of LTBP-4 cDNA as a probe, the corresponding genomic fragment was obtained from a human PAC library. The clone was verified to contain the LTBP-4 gene by partial sequencing. This PAC clone was used to analyze the chromosomal localization of the LTBP-4 gene. Human metaphase leukocyte chromosomes were hybridized with biotinylated LTBP-4 PAC probe and analyzed with a fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital imaging system. LTBP-4 gene was localized to chromosome 19, at the region of 19q13.1–19q13.2 (Fig. 4 B). The localization to chromosome 19 was verified with painting using chromosome 19-specific probe. To analyze whether the LTBP-4 gene is also present in other species, we probed the EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from different species using the LTBP-4 cDNA clone 1.1.1A (see Fig. 1 A). The results of the Southern hybridization indicated that a gene homologous to human LTBP-4 exists in all mammalian species analyzed, including human, monkey, mouse, and rat (Fig. 4 B). In addition, we have identified murine EST clones, representing mouse LTBP-4. 3J. Saharinen and J. Keski-Oja, manuscript in preparation. A NotI fragment of LTBP-4 was used as a probe to elucidate the expression levels of LTBP-4 in different tissues. Based on the hybridization results under high stringency conditions in Northern blots, the size of LTBP-4 mRNA was found to be approximately 5.1 kilobase pairs (Fig. 5 A). This correlates well with the cloned LTBP-4S sequence of 4944 base pairs, implying that the cloned LTBP-4S represents the full-length ORF of this mRNA. The highest expression levels of LTBP-4 were found in the heart, uterus, and small intestine (Fig. 5, A and B). LTBP-4 mRNA from all tissues studied was of the same size, suggesting that the different forms of LTBP-4 are not detectable, because their small size differences are beyond the resolution of the agarose gels used for Northern hybridization analysis. Essentially identical results were obtained also from an another Northern analysis using anAgeI-NotI fragment of LTBP-4 (data not shown). LTBP-4 expression levels were studied next by using a dot blot of poly(A) mRNAs from 50 different human tissues. The amounts of total mRNA in the dots have been equalized by using the probed mRNA levels for a set of 8 different housekeeping genes. The same two fragments of LTBP-4 that were used in Northern blotting were used as probes in two independent analyses. After high stringency washes, the dots representing different tissues on the filter were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. The highest expression levels of LTBP-4 were seen in the same organs as in Northern blots (Fig. 5 B). In addition, relatively high hybridization signals were detected in aorta, ovary, and adrenal gland. Tissues in which the expression levels were found to be below average of all tissues quantitated were omitted from Fig. 5 B. As fibroblastic cells are known to produce LTBP-1 and -2, we used the serum-free conditioned medium from human lung fibroblasts (CCL-137) to analyze the expression and secretion of the LTBP-4 protein. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against two synthetic peptides of LTBP-4. These peptides were from the 3rd (epitope for the Ab 28-3) and 4th (epitope for the Ab 33-4) 8-Cys repeats of LTBP-4. Immunoblotting analysis of the conditioned medium from confluent fibroblasts under reducing conditions indicated that both Ab 28-3 and 33-4 detected LTBP-4 protein, which had a molecular mass of approximately 250 kDa (Fig. 6 A). Immunoblotting results obtained using both Ab 28-3 and 33-4 under reducing conditions indicated that free LTBP-4 exists in two forms of slightly different molecular mass. Since the sequence for LTBP-4 codes for 5 N-glycosylation sites, we analyzed whether the observed heterogeneity of free LTBP-4 forms could be a consequence ofN-glycosylation. Fibroblast-conditioned medium was subjected to removal of N-linked oligosaccharides byN-glycosidase F, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses (data not shown). We found no detectable changes in the observed molecular mass of LTBP-4 after deglycosylation. In order to control the specificity of Ab 28-3 and 33-4, we analyzed the conditioned medium from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, as well as from two CHO cell clones overexpressing human LTBP-1 and LTBP-2."

Immunoblot analysis revealed that the 51C/SHIP2 protein was widely expressed in fibroblast and nonhematopoietic tumor cell lines, unlike the SHIP protein, which was found only in cell lines of hematopoietic origin. The 51C/SHIP2 antiserum precipitated a protein of approximately 145 kDa along with an activity which hydrolyzed phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 51C/SHIP2 protein occurred in response to treatment of cells with epidermal growth (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), or insulin. EGF and PDGF induced transient tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2, with maximal tyrosine phosphorylation occurring at 5–10 min following treatment and returning to near basal levels within 20 min. In contrast, treatment of cells with NGF, IGF-1, or insulin resulted in prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2 protein, with 40–80% maximal phosphorylation sustained for up to 2 h following agonist treatment. The kinetics of activation of the Akt/PKB protein kinase by the various factors correlated well with the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2. EGF, NGF, and PDGF stimulated the association of 51C/SHIP2 protein with the Shc adapter protein; however, no Shc could be detected in 51C/SHIP2-immune precipitates from cells treated with IGF-1 or insulin. The data suggest that 51C/SHIP2 may play a significant role in regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase signaling by growth factors and insulin.

It is not clear whether tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP promotes or diminishes these inhibitory effects. Since PI 3-kinase appears to play a fundamental role in signal transduction in all mammalian cell types and SHIP expression is limited to hematopoietic cells, we examined whether the more widely expressed SHIP-related protein 51C/SHIP2 (26Hejna J.A Saito H.

Extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and supernatants were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with the desired antiserum.

For analysis of whole cell levels of 51C/SHIP2 and SHIP, cells were grown in 35-mm dishes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in SDS sample buffer. Samples containing 25 μg of protein were loaded onto 4–15% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were probed with preimmune serum, 51C/SHIP2 antiserum, or SHIP antiserum. For other experiments, immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology) (1:1000 dilution in 2% bovine serum albumin) or with a 1:1000 dilution of Shc antibodies. Blots were developed with a chemiluminescent detection system (New England Biolabs), except for anti-Shc immunoblots which were developed with 125I-protein A. Assay of Akt/PKB activity was performed as described by Barthel et al. (31Barthel A. Nakatani K Dandekar A.A. Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Approximately 2 × 106cells were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 nm okadaic acid, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm NaVO4. Lysates were cleared and immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of Akt antibody (Upstate Biotechnology no. 06-608) bound to protein A beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Immune precipitates were washed three times with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and twice with kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Phosphorylation of GSK-3 peptide was performed in kinase reaction buffer with 100 μm GSK-3 peptide, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm protein kinase A inhibitor, and 5 μm ATP (2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per assay). Approximately 2 × 107 control and treated (25 nm IGF-1 for 10 min) SH-SY5Y cells were lysed in SDS-free radioimmune precipitation buffer (32Decker S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) containing 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μm aprotinin, 10 μmleupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min prior to immunoprecipitation with preimmune serum or with 51C/SHIP2 antiserum. Immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose beads which were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Approximately 105 cpm of PtdIns(3,4,5)-[32P]P3 (labeled at the 3′ position with PI 3-kinase according to Lioubin et al. (21Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Schickwann T. Carberg K. Aebersold R.

The lipids were suspended in 200 μl of reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10 mm MgCl2 by sonication with a probe sonicator. 30 μl of lipid suspension were added to each sample of washed beads, and the reaction mixtures were incubated with rocking at room temperature for 20 min. Samples were extracted with 100 μl of chloroform:methanol 1:1 and 100 μl of 2 m KCl, and the products were separated by TLC (21Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Schickwann T. Carberg K. Aebersold R.

Antiserum was raised against the 51C/SHIP2 protein to examine the role of this protein in growth factor signaling. The region of 51C/SHIP2 chosen as antigen showed no similarity to any region of SHIP. Initial experiments were performed to test the specificity of the antiserum and compare the distribution of 51C/SHIP2 with that of SHIP in a variety of cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the 51C/SHIP2 antiserum specificity recognized a protein of 145 kDa in a number of adherent human and rodent cell lines. Only the HL-60 and A20 hematopoietic cell lines failed to express the protein. In contrast, 145-kDa SHIP reactivity was seen only in HL-60 and A20 cells, with a somewhat larger prominent band present in PC-12 cells. The 51C/SHIP2 antiserum also specifically immunoprecipitated a protein of 145 kDa from [35S]methionine-labeled SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1 B). We wished to test whether the 51C/SHIP2 antiserum could precipitate 5′-phosphatase activity toward PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Lysates were prepared from SH-SY5Y cells which had been treated with vehicle or with 25 nm IGF-1 and incubated with PtdIns(3,4,5)-[32P]P3 which had been32P-labeled at the D3′ position with PI 3′-kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2). A severalfold increase in the amount of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3hydrolyzed to PdtIns(3,4)P2 was found from lysates immune precipitated with 51C/SHIP2 antiserum relative to preimmune serum. The level of activity did not appear to be influenced by IGF-1 treatment. Since SHIP becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated following cytokine treatment of hematopoietic cells, we examined the effects of growth factor treatment on tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2 (Fig. 3). EGF, PDGF, and IGF-1 all stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2 in SH-SY5Y cells, as did NGF in PC-12 cells and insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of about 52 and 66 kDa co-precipitated with 51C/SHIP2 from EGF-treated SH-SY5Y cells and a band of 52 kDa co-precipitated with 51C/SHIP2 from NGF-treated PC-12 cells. 51C/SHIP2 was constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed rat fibroblasts and several other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins co-precipitated with 51C/SHIP2 from these cells. Since elements of PI 3-kinase function such as the extent and duration of Akt/PKB activation vary with different growth factors (33Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), the effects of growth factors and insulin on the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 51C/SHIP2 protein were determined (Fig. 4). EGF and PDGF caused transient increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2 protein in SH-SY5Y cells, with maximal effects at 5–10 min. Tyrosine phosphorylation returned to near control levels after 20 min. Transient tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2 protein was also seen in EGF-treated PC-12 cells (not shown). In contrast, IGF-1, insulin, and NGF induced long term tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2, with 40–80% maximal levels maintained for up to 2 h. Again, 52- and 66-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were present in 51C/SHIP2 immunoprecipitates from EGF- and PDGF-treated cells and the 52-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein was seen in 51C/SHIP2 immunoprecipitates from NGF-treated PC-12 cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation could regulate the activity of 51C/SHIP2 leading to changes in intracellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 which could influence the activity of the Akt/PKB protein kinase (12Alessi D.R.

For this reason, the effects of the various growth factors on the extent and duration of Akt/PKB activation were determined. (Fig. 5). EGF stimulated a transient activation of Akt/PKB which returned to near base-line levels after 20 min of treatment. IGF-1 and insulin treatment resulted in a somewhat higher maximal level of activation which was sustained for at least 2 h. NGF and PDGF treatment produced equivalent maximal activation of AKT/PKB relative to IGF-1 and insulin but of shorter duration. The 52- and 66-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins co-precipitating with 51C/SHIP2 were similar in size to two forms of Shc, and the 52-kDa form of Shc has been shown to associate with SHIP, leading us to directly investigate whether the co-precipitating proteins were forms of Shc. In these experiments, lysates from cells treated with growth factors and insulin were immune-precipitated with 51C/SHIP2 antiserum and immunoblotted with Shc antibodies (Fig. 6). The 52- and 66-kDa forms of Shc co-precipitated with 51C/SHIP2 protein from SH-SY5Y cells treated with EGF and PDGF, and the 52-kDa form co-precipitated with 51C/SHIP2 from NGF-treated PC-12 cells. No Shc was detected in 51C/SHIP2 immunoprecipitates from insulin-treated 3T3-L1 cells or IGF-1-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Even though the 66-kDa form of Shc was equally abundant in SH-SY5Y cells and PC-12 cells, it associated with 51C/SHIP2 from EGF- and PDGF-treated SH-SY5Y cells, but not with 51C/SHIP2 from NGF-treated PC-12 cells. The 51C/SHIP2 protein is a prominent substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation in response to treatment of cells with a number of growth factors and insulin. These results suggest that 51C/SHIP2 may be a general modulator the PI 3-kinase response to growth factors and insulin by regulating levels of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. As with SHIP, the question arises whether 51C/SHIP2 activity would function to positively or negatively regulate growth factor signaling. For example, the PH domain of Akt/PKB binds both PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, however, only binding of PtdIns(3,4)P2 has been reported to result in activation of the enzyme (11Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 15Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8474-8481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PDK1, which phosphorylates and partially activates Atk/PKB, is more strongly activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 than by PtdIns(3,4)P2 (13Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R.

If 51C/SHIP2 is activated by growth factors and plays a positive role in signaling, it could increase levels of PtdIns(3,4)P2 without totally depleting PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and bring about increased activation of Akt/PKB or other downstream effectors of PI 3-kinase. Alternatively, 51C/SHIP2 activity could function to deplete PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels and attenuate PI 3-kinase signaling and the effect of growth factors would be to inhibit 51C/SHIP2 activity and potentiate PI 3-kinase signaling. In support of the latter hypothesis, overexpression of SHIP in the FD hematopoietic cell line inhibited mitogenic signaling by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (22Liu L. Damen J.E. Ware M.D. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10998-11001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and microinjection SHIP intoXenopus oocytes inhibited insulin-induced germinal vesicle breakdown (34Deuter-Rheinhard M. Apell G. Pot D. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Kavanaugh W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2559-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The role to tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP and 51C/SHIP2 in the function of these proteins is not well understood. Osbourne et al. (24Osborne M.A. Zenner G. Lubinus M. Zhang X. Songyang Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29271-29278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP by Lck inhibits SHIP activity, suggesting that SHIP is normally active and that one effect of agonist treatment would be to inhibit its activity in order to increase PI 3-kinase-generated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Constitutive phosphorylation of SHIP in bcr-Abl-transformed cells and of 51C/SHIP2 in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells could support this model, since transformation by these oncogenes activates PI 3-kinase and results in elevated basal levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (35Fukui Y. Saltiel A.R. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 407-411PubMed Google Scholar, 36Skorski T. Kanakaraj P. Nieborowsha-Skorska M. Ratajczak M.Z. Wen S.C. Zon G. Gewirtz A.M. Blood. 1995; 15: 726-736Crossref Google Scholar). Our data showing prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2 induced by IGF-1, NGF, and insulin could also support this model. IGF-1 and NGF are important survival factors which protect cells from apoptosis, and activation of Akt/PKB through the PI 3-kinase appears to represent a significant pathway in the anti-apoptotic activity of these growth factors (7Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 32Decker S.J. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Insulin signaling has also been shown to be dependent on PI 3-kinase signaling through Akt/PKB, which has been shown to be involved in both GLUT4 translocation (9Okada T. Kawano T. Sakakibara T Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of glycogen synthesis (38Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 hydrolysis to PtdIns(3,4)P2 by relatively long term tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2 could yield ratios of these mediators, which would potentiate PI 3-kinase signaling and contribute to the prolonged activation of Akt/PKB seen with IGF-1 and insulin. However, thrombin stimulation of platelets leads to translocation of SHIP and PI 3-kinase to the actin cytoskeleton, coincident with prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP and with the accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 (39Giruiato S.

Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 268: 13773-13776Google Scholar). In this case, agonist-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP appears to increase its activity (i.e. increase generation of PtdIns(3,4)P2) and SHIP appears to play a positive role in thrombin signaling. The transient tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2 by EGF and PDGF may correlate with a shorter duration of activation of PI 3-kinase by these factors in the cell types we have examined. Another point of divergence for signaling by the different growth factor receptors could be the ability to induce association of 51C/SHIP2 with Shc. EGF, PDGF, and NGF clearly stimulate the association of 51C/SHIP2 with Shc. On the other hand, IGF-1 and insulin stimulate comparable tyrosine phosphorylation of 51C/SHIP2 relative to EGF and NGF, but fail to promote formation of 51C/SHIP2-Shc complexes. The binding of Shc to 51C/SHIP2 and SHIP may serve to attenuate signaling through the Ras pathway by competing with Grb2/Sos complexes for binding to Shc (41Liu L. Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6926-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The differences in Shc binding to 51C/SHIP2 found for EGF, PDGF, and NGF versus insulin and IGF-1 may reflect the relative importance of the Ras pathway in cellular responses generated by these growth factors. These differences in interaction with Shc may also influence the capacity of the different factors to stimulate Akt/PKB activity. In addition, the 66-kDa form of Shc associated with 51C/SHIP2 from EGF- and PDGF-treated SH-SY5Y cells, but not from NGF-treated PC-12 cells, even though similar levels of 66-kDa Shc were present and tyrosine phosphorylated by respective agonists in both cell types. This form of Shc has recently been reported to limit activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by EGF (42Okada S. Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Blaikie P. Margolis B. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28042-28049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), perhaps by competing Grb2/Sos complexes away from the 52-kDa form of Shc. The capacity to stimulate interaction of 66-kDa Shc with 51C/SHIP2 could contribute to differences in the kinetics of activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase observed for EGF versus NGF (4Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). In summary, the 51C/SHIP2 protein is a novel substrate tyrosine phosphorylated in response to treatment of cells with growth factors and insulin and which may serve varied functions for different growth factors and cell types. Future efforts will be directed toward more detailed delineation of the processes regulated by 51C/SHIP2.

https://openalex.org/W2005901295,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) is implicated in cellular events including glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, and protein synthesis. It is activated in insulin-stimulated cells by binding of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains in its 85-kDa regulatory subunit to insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and, others. We have previously shown that IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity is not essential for insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and that alternate pathways exist in these cells. We now show that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the p85N-SH2 domain in these cells behaves in a dominant-negative manner, interfering with complex formation between endogenous PI 3-K and its SH2 binding targets. This not only inhibited insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, but also completely blocked anti-phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase activity, which would include the non-IRS-1-associated activity. This resulted in inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, glycogen synthase activity and DNA synthesis. Further, Ser/Thr phosphorylation of downstream molecules Akt and p70 S6 kinase was inhibited. However, co-expression of a membrane-targeted p110CAAX with the p85N-SH2 protein rescued glucose transport, supporting our argument that the p85N-SH2 protein specifically blocks insulin-mediated PI 3-kinase activity, and, that the signaling pathways downstream of PI 3-kinase are intact. Unexpectedly, GTP-bound Ras was elevated in the basal state. Since p85 is known to interact with GTPase-activating protein in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the overexpressed p85N-SH2 peptide could titrate out cellular GTPase-activating protein by direct association, such that it is unavailable to hydrolyze GTP-bound Ras. However, insulin-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation was inhibited. Thus, PI 3-kinase may be required for this action at a step independent of and downstream of Ras. We conclude that, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, non-IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity is crucial for insulin's metabolic signaling, and that overexpressed p85N-SH2 protein inhibits a variety of insulin's ultimate biological effects.

Insulin binding to its cell surface receptors initiates diverse metabolic and mitogenic signals by activation of a complex signaling cascade of protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, as well as lipid kinases (1Cheatham B.

Two isoforms of the catalytic subunit (p110α and p110β) and several isoforms of the regulatory subunit (p55α, p55PIK, p85α, and p85β) have been cloned so far. The regulatory subunit contains several well known functional domains: one Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, homology to the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) gene, two proline-rich motifs, and two Src homology region 2 (SH2) domains (3Dhand R.

Following insulin stimulation, the phosphorylated YXXM motifs in IRS-1 binds to the SH2 domains of p85 stimulating the lipid kinase activity of the p110 subunit. Through the same SH2 mechanism, PI 3-kinase can associate with other proteins such as IRS-2–4, and the insulin receptor itself (9Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.-J.

PI 3-kinase phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate on the D-3 position of the inositol ring producing phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, respectively. Insulin induces the production of D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides through stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity in various tissues and cultured cells.Insulin is a pleiotropic hormone that initiates a variety of biologic effects through a complex set of signaling cascades. As a general view, however, two main branches of the insulin signaling pathway can be activated in most cell types: one is controlled predominantly by PI 3-kinase (1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and the other by the small GTP-binding protein p21ras (1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major route by which insulin stimulates PI 3-kinase activity is through tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, as described above. Insulin stimulates Ras activity through a dual mechanism involving Shc, and to a lesser extent, IRS-1, which subsequently binds to the Grb2·SOS complex, activating p21ras(12Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois J.W. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10734-10738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulated Ras then activates a cascade of protein serine/threonine kinases which includes Raf, MEK, and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, ERK1 and ERK2 (reviewed in Refs. 1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Trends Endocrinol.

Activation of both of these pathways appears to be necessary for the mitogenic effects of insulin (12Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois J.W. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

For example, Yamauchi et al. (26Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that PI 3-kinase may lie upstream of Ras and Raf in mediating mitogenic effects of insulin. On the other hand, experiments using wortmannin to inhibit PI 3-kinase activity have shown that the effect of insulin on p21ras·GTP loading in CHO cells is independent of PI 3-kinase (27Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 9: 7415-7419Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar). However, reciprocal relationships between PI 3-kinase and p21ras have also been demonstrated (28Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Thus, one report has shown that activated Ras can stimulate PI 3-kinase activity, whereas other investigators have shown that the biologic effects of constitutively activated PI 3-kinase are Ras-dependent (29Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.W. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Thus, although the exact relationship between PI 3-kinase and p21ras is unclear, abundant data exist to indicate that they are interconnected in some way (30Sjolander A. Yamamoto K. Huber B.E. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7908-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).In the current studies, we have extensively evaluated the role of PI 3-kinase activity in a diverse array of insulin actions. Our approach was based upon the notion that cellular overexpression of the N-SH2 domain of the p85 subunit would disrupt complex formation between endogenous PI 3-kinase and its SH2 domain binding targets, such as IRS-1. This, in turn, would prevent insulin activation of PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity, allowing us to elucidate the biologic actions of this enzyme in insulin target cells such as 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Since gene transfer into 3T3-L1 adipocytes can be problematic, we elected to use recombinant adenovirus to achieve these goals. We (31Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Gustafson T.A. Martin J.L. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7386-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and others (32Frevert E.U. Khan B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), have recently demonstrated that adenovirus mediated gene delivery allows high efficiency gene transduction and protein expression in terminally differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Thus, we prepared a recombinant adenovirus encoding the N-SH2 domain of the p85 α subunit of PI 3-kinase in order to overexpress this protein domain within 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Using this approach, we have investigated the acute effects of interrupting p85 association with insulin-stimulated target proteins on the ultimate biologic effects of insulin.DISCUSSIONInsulin stimulation leads to extensive tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Phosphorylated IRS-1 binds to the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and activates its p110 subunit, and this is a major mechanism by which insulin stimulates this enzyme. Several lines of evidence suggest that PI 3-kinase is involved in mediating mitogenic effects of various growth factors (2Braselmann S. Palmer T.M. Cook S.J. Curr.

Despite a great deal of information on both the structure and function of PI 3-kinase, the precise mechanism of its involvement in mediating insulin signaling is not fully understood.In the current study, we have extensively evaluated the role of PI 3-kinase activity in a diverse array of insulin actions. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that cellular overexpression of the N-SH2 domain of the p85 subunit would competitively inhibit complex formation between endogenous PI 3-kinase and its SH2 domain binding targets such as IRS-1, -2, -3, -4, the insulin receptor, and others. This in turn, will prevent insulin activation of PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity, allowing us to elucidate the biologic actions of this enzyme in insulin target cells such as 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Indeed our data show not only a marked inhibition of insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, but we find a complete blockade of insulin-stimulated anti-phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase activity, which would include the non-IRS-1-associated activity. Predictably, and in agreement with previous findings, inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity resulted in abrogation of insulin's effects on glucose uptake and DNA synthesis (12Sasaoka T. Draznin B.

Other major findings of these experiments are that inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity resulted in inhibition of glycogen synthase activity and stimulation of MAPK activation by insulin. In contrast, overexpression of the p85N-SH2 protein led to a 2-fold increase in basal, insulin-independent GTP-bound levels of p21ras. However, insulin treatment did not further alter the levels of GTP-bound p21ras in these cells. Inhibition of the PI 3-kinase activity, also led to significant impairment of other downstream signaling effects of insulin such as Akt and p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation. These results lead to several predictions and conclusions.The activation of MAPK by insulin depends on activation of Ras (1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr.

Formation of GTP-bound Ras leads to activation of the protein serine/threonine kinase cascade including Raf-1 kinase, MEK and MAPK (1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr.

Recent studies using specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase or constitutively active and dominant negative mutants of the enzyme, have yielded confusing, and potentially conflicting results suggesting that PI 3-kinase can be either downstream or upstream of Ras (26Yamauchi K.

In the present study, using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we have demonstrated that inhibition of PI 3-kinase decreased insulin-induced activation of MAPK, although the levels of GTP-bound Ras were increased ∼2-fold in the basal state. Thus, PI 3-kinase may be required for the activation of MAPK at a step independent of and downstream of Ras.The importance of PI 3-kinase for activation of ERKs 1 and 2 has been controversial. Expression of activated forms of p110α has been reported to stimulate the MAPK pathway in one case (29Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.W. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), but not in others (32Frevert E.U. Khan B.B. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). A recent study found that overexpression of the p110γ isoform resulted in activation of ERKs 1 and 2, whereas p110α was without effect (45Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Our findings indicating the involvement of PI 3-kinase in the activation of MAPK seem to be consistent with a recent report showing that treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, either with wortmannin or LY294002, inhibited insulin-induced activation of Raf-1 and MAPKs with no effect on the formation of GTP-bound Ras (46Suga J. Yoshimasa Y. Yamada K. Yamamoto Y. Inoue G. Okamoto M. Hayashi T. Shigemoto M. Kosaki A. Kuzuya H. Nakao K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, wortmannin did not affect epidermal growth factor-induced activation of Raf and MAPK in the same system, indicating that differential mechanisms to activate Raf-1 and MAPKs by insulin and epidermal growth factor exist in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Very similar observations have been reported using rat adipocytes (47Liu H. Lee J. Kublaoui B. Pilch P.F. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 119AGoogle Scholar). However, the involvement of PI 3-kinase in MAPK activation appears to be cell type-specific, because wortmannin did not inhibit insulin-induced activation of MAPK in CHO cells in the above study (46Suga J. Yoshimasa Y. Yamada K. Yamamoto Y. Inoue G. Okamoto M. Hayashi T. Shigemoto M. Kosaki A. Kuzuya H. Nakao K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).As mentioned earlier, the relationship between PI 3-kinase and Ras is a matter of debate. Some observations indicate that PI 3-kinase could be upstream, downstream, or independent of Ras; these observations are perhaps related to cell-type differences (reviewed in Ref. 48Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Our data reinforce the idea that PI 3-kinase is upstream and can activate the Ras pathway. However, our unexpected findings were the influence of overexpression of the p85N-SH2 domain of PI 3-kinase to stimulate formation of p21ras·GTP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. PI 3-kinase and Ras form a complex, suggesting an intimate relation between the function of these molecules (28Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar), and it can be argued that a loss of PI 3-kinase activity could disrupt basal Ras-p110 binding, which may be required for PI 3-kinase signaling.It is known that insulin stimulates p21ras·GTP loading by increasing the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Sos (49Draznin B. Chang L. Leitner J.W. Takata Y. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19998-20001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Medema R.H. deVries-Smits A.M.M. van der Zon G.C. M,. Maassen J.A Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Return of p21ras into its inactive conformation is facilitated by GAP that hydrolyzes GTP to GDP. Therefore, overexpression of the p85N-SH2 domain of PI 3-kinase can stimulate formation of p21ras·GTP either by stimulating the guanine exchange activity of Sos or by diminishing the activity of GAP. Stimulation of Sos activity is unlikely because Langolis et al. (51Langolis J. Leitner W. Medth T. Sasaoka T. Olefsky J.M. Draznin B. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) have shown that immunodepletion of PI 3-kinase from lysates of insulin-stimulated cells does not alter the activity level of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the increase in basal GTP-bound Ras in the p85N-SH2 expressing cells is that the p85N-SH2 depletes the pool of GAP in these cells. Indeed, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase is already in excess compared with the p110 subunit, and it has been shown to interact with GAP (presumably via p62, a GAP-associated protein) (52DePaolo D. Reusch J.E.-B. Carel K. Bhuripanyo P. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the p85N-SH2 peptide could titrate out cellular GAP by direct association, such that GAP is not available to hydrolyze p21ras·GTP. The elevated p21ras·GTP levels do not appear to affect MAPK activity, since we find that the p85N-SH2 protein inhibits insulin-induced MAPK phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of PI 3-kinase on the MAPK cascade most likely occurs at a level independent of Ras. Therefore, in these cells, insulin is able to stimulate MAPK via a Ras-independent pathway. These results are in agreement with the observations of Carel et al. (53Carel K. Kummer J.L. Schubert C. Leitner J.W. Heidenreich K.A. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30625-30630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), who also found that insulin activates MAPK by a Ras-independent pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and by a Ras-dependent pathway in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts.In an earlier report, we utilized an adenovirus system to express the PTB domain of IRS-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This led to a marked decrease in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, but no inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport (31Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Gustafson T.A. Martin J.L. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7386-739"
https://openalex.org/W2042427553,"Insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2) is expressed in most embryonic tissues and is required for normal development during gestation. After birth IGF-2 expression is extinguished in most tissues, but the gene is often reactivated during tumorigenesis. Tumors secrete high molecular weight forms of IGF-2 that result from aberrant post-translational processing of pro-IGF-2. As a first step toward understanding how high molecular weight IGF-2 peptides might contribute to tumor progression, we have characterized the biosynthesis of IGF-2 in a human embryonic cell line. We have found that pro-IGF-2 can initially form two disulfide isomers that undergo rearrangement to a single conformation in vivo. The addition of N-acetylgalactosamine to Ser71, Thr72, Thr75, and Thr139 likely occurs in the cis- Golgi apparatus. Sialic acid addition begins in the trans- Golgi apparatus, but IGF-2 peptides must reach the trans-Golgi network for oligosaccharide maturation to be completed. Endoproteolysis occurs concomitant to or slightly after oligosaccharide maturation. Cleavage was observed only at Arg104, resulting in the secretion of IGF-2-(1-104) and free E-peptide. Proteolysis required basic residues in the P1 (Arg104) and P4 (Arg101) positions, was completely blocked by a furin inhibitor, and was enhanced by coexpression with furin, PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, and LPC. These data suggest that members of the subtilisin-related proprotein convertase family mediate processing of pro-IGF-2 at Arg104. We did not detect the IGF-2 peptides that are most abundant in normal serum, mature IGF-2, and IGF-2-(1-87), in this expression system, which indicates that novel endoproteases are responsible for generating these products."

Two Hrad1alternative splice variants with different open reading frames have been identified; one codes for a long form, Hrad1A, and the other encodes a short form because of N-terminal truncation, Hrad1B. Hrad1A has 60% identity to the S. pombe rad1+sequence at the DNA level and 49% identity and 72% similarity at the amino acid level. Northern blot analysis indicates elevated levels of expression in testis and cancer cell lines. Chromosomal localization by fluorescence in situ hybridization indicates thatHrad1 is located on chromosome 5p13.2–13.3. This region is subject to loss of heterozygosity in several human cancers. Hrad1 also shares homology with the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeRAD17 and Ustilago maydis REC1 proteins.

For any dividing cell it is essential to maintain the integrity of the genome ensuring that DNA replication occurs once per cell cycle and that identical chromosomal copies are distributed equally to two daughter cells at mitosis. When cells are subjected to conditions that interfere with DNA replication or spindle assembly or that cause damage to DNA, cell-cycle progression halts, permitting cell cycle phase completion or DNA repair. These control mechanisms are referred to as “checkpoints” (reviewed in Refs. 1Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar, 2Hartwell L.H.

The loss of checkpoint control in mammalian cells, most notably through the inactivation of p53, results in genomic instability leading to the amplification, rearrangement, or loss of chromosomes, events that commonly occur in cancer cells (2Hartwell L.H.

Hoekstra M.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 32-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the fission yeast at least two distinct checkpoint pathways have been identified: the DNA replication-dependent checkpoint pathway that ensures that S phase is completed before M phase is initiated and the DNA damage-dependent checkpoint pathway that acts to halt the cell cycle when genomic integrity is compromised (5Carr A.M.

In S. cerevisiae the two checkpoint pathways are genetically separable; four gene products, RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, have been identified as essential for the DNA damage-dependent checkpoint pathway, and three gene products, POL2, RFC5, and DPB11, are essential for the DNA replication-dependent checkpoint pathway (reviewed in Refs.3Elledge S.J.

Currently little is known about the biochemistry of checkpoint control. The genetic data in yeast suggest that a complex of proteins mediates the monitoring of replication-specific structures and damaged DNA (10Al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J.

Furthermore, recent biochemical studies in S. pombe and humans suggest that the cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage is brought about by the activation of a signal transduction pathway involving the putative protein kinases ATM/ATR and Hchk1, resulting in inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc25 and subsequent stabilization of the inhibitory Tyr15 phosphorylation of Cdc2 (7Bentley N.J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and is synthetically lethal when combined with mitosis-promoting mutations such as wee1-50 (15Rowley R Subramani S. Young P.G.

Biol. 1990; 10: 3750-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the predicted amino acid sequence shows significant sequence similarity to the Ustilago maydis protein Rec1 (18Long K.E. Sunnerhagen P. Subramani S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 148: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and S. cerevisiae RAD17 (20Siede W. Nusspaumer G. Portillo V. Rodriguez R. Friedberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutations in these genes lead to cell cycle checkpoint defects and other phenotypes associated with alterations in DNA repair and recombination (19Holden D.W. Spanos A. Kanuag N. Banks G.R. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Siede W. Nusspaumer G. Portillo V. Rodriguez R. Friedberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Purified Rec1 protein has been shown to have a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity (21Thelen M.P. Onel K. Holloman W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 747-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Rec1/Rad1/RAD17 may be involved in modifying DNA damage (22Carr A.M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Lydall D. Weinert T. Science. 1995; 270: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Studies of Rec1 truncation mutants have demonstrated that the nuclease activity is located in the N-terminal half of the protein. However the Rec1-dependent checkpoint function requires the C-terminal region of the protein and does not require the exonuclease activity (24Onel K. Thelen M.P. Ferguson D.O. Bennett R.L. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5329-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Onel K. Koff A. Bennett A.L. Unrau P. Holloman W.K. Genetics. 1996; 143: 165-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Rec1 mutants that lack exonuclease activity have a 100-fold higher rate of spontaneous mutation, indicating that the exonuclease function may be required for mismatch repair (24Onel K. Thelen M.P. Ferguson D.O. Bennett R.L. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5329-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus it would appear that the Rec1 protein is bifunctional, having an N-terminal exonuclease domain and a C-terminal checkpoint domain.In this report we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel human cDNA, designated Hrad1, which is highly similar to the S. pombe rad1+ checkpoint gene. We also report the cloning of a mouse homologue designated Mrad1. We show that Hrad1 is subject to alternative splicing giving rise to two potential open reading frames (ORFs) 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; FISH, fluorescencein situ hybridization; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EST, expressed sequence tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; kb, kilobase pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; FISH, fluorescencein situ hybridization; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EST, expressed sequence tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; kb, kilobase pair(s). coding for a full-length and a truncated form of Hrad1, designated Hrad1A and Hrad1B, respectively. We have expressed in Escherichia. coliand affinity purified N-terminal polyhistidine-tagged fusions of Hrad1A and Hrad1B and show that Hrad1A but not Hrad1B has 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity. Hrad1B corresponds to the C-terminal domain of Rec1 that has been implicated solely in checkpoint function. Thus we can speculate that Hrad1A plays a role in the recognition and processing of DNA ends and also in checkpoint function, whereas the role of Hrad1B may be restricted to checkpoint control.DISCUSSIONIn S. pombe, cell cycle checkpoint arrest in response to DNA damage or inhibition of replication is dependent on multiple proteins. Six gene products have been identified that act early in the process of checkpoint control, and to date human homologues of two of these proteins have been identified, Hrad9 (9Lieberman H.B. Hopkins K.M. Nass M. Demetrick D. Davey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13890-13895Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and ATR (7Bentley N.J. Holtzman D.A. Flaggs G. Keegan K.S. DeMaggio A. Ford J.C. Hoekstra M. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6641-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 8Cimprich K.A. Shin T.B. Keith C.T. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2850-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Based upon sequence homology and biochemical activity, we have identified a third component, Hrad1, a human homologue of he S. pombe rad1+ cell cycle checkpoint gene. Hrad1 is highly similar to S. pombe rad1+, S. cerevisiae RAD17, and the REC1 gene ofU. maydis. Mutations in these genes lead to similar cell cycle checkpoint defects and other phenotypes associated with alterations in DNA repair and recombination (16Nasim A. Smith B.P. Genetics. 1975; 79: 573-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Holden D.W. Spanos A. Kanuag N. Banks G.R. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Siede W. Nusspaumer G. Portillo V. Rodriguez R. Friedberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).We have shown that Hrad1 is subject to alternative splicing giving rise to two ORFs, a long form, designated Hrad1A, and an N-terminal truncation, designated Hrad1B. The Hrad1 gene has at least three transcripts of 5, 3, and 1.3 kb present in all tissues that we examined and that are increased in all the cancer cell lines examined, suggesting either that transcription ofHrad1 is proliferation-dependent or that it is increased in response to the genomic instability of cancer cell lines. In testis we observed an increase specifically in the 1.3-kb transcript. We have demonstrated that this transcript does not correspond to Hrad1A, suggesting that it corresponds to Hrad1B or an as yet unidentified third form of Hrad1. Several yeast cell cycle checkpoint genes play important roles in meiosis (39Kato R. Ogawa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3104-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and recently ATM and ATR (the human homologues of S. pombe rad3) were shown to be highly expressed in testis where they interact with meiotic chromosomes. This suggests a direct role for these proteins in recognizing and responding to DNA strand interruptions that occur during meiotic recombination (40Keegan K.S. Holtzman D.A. Plug A.W. Christenson E.R. Brainerd E.E. Flaggs G. Bentley N.J. Taylor E.M. Meyn M.S. Moss S.B. Carr A.M. Ashley T. Hoekstra M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2423-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Hrad1 could form part of this recognition complex in association with ATM or ATR.When expressed in an S. pombe rad1::ura4+ strain, both Hrad1Aand Hrad1B failed to complement the phenotypes associated with loss of checkpoint function. However, this should not be taken as evidence against functional homology because failure to complement has been shown for other checkpoint genes such as ATR andHchk1 (7Bentley N.J. Holtzman D.A. Flaggs G. Keegan K.S. DeMaggio A. Ford J.C. Hoekstra M. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6641-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar,12Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). 2A. Parker, unpublished results. The Hrad1 amino acid sequence is significantly similar to the U. maydis REC1 protein, indicating that Hrad1 may have a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity. We have confirmed the predicted 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity for Hrad1A by demonstrating that Hrad1A expressed as a hexahistidine fusion protein and purified from E. coliis an exonuclease with a 6-fold preference for 3′ termini. The biochemical properties of HisHrad1A were very similar to REC1 (21Thelen M.P. Onel K. Holloman W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 747-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated Hrad1B, expressed as a hexahistidine fusion protein, lacks detectable exonuclease activity. This may reflect the in vivo biological activity or may be a consequence of the purification regimes. To fully address this question, purification of endogenous Hrad1B from mammalian cells or from a heterologous expression system that yields native protein will be required.An analysis of C-terminal truncations of the Rec1 protein has established that the C-terminal portion of the Rec1 protein is not essential for exonuclease activity but is crucial for G2-M checkpoint function (24Onel K. Thelen M.P. Ferguson D.O. Bennett R.L. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5329-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Onel K. Koff A. Bennett A.L. Unrau P. Holloman W.K. Genetics. 1996; 143: 165-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The checkpoint-compromised U. maydis rec1-1 mutant results from a C-terminal truncation lacking 122 amino acids (24Onel K. Thelen M.P. Ferguson D.O. Bennett R.L. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5329-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), including a block of sequence containing four periodically spaced leucines that is conserved in Hrad1 and S. pombe Rad1 but not in S. cerevisiae RAD17 (24Onel K. Thelen M.P. Ferguson D.O. Bennett R.L. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5329-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This may represent a domain important in interactions with other checkpoint components. In addition, the rec1-5 mutant that lacks exonuclease activity has a 100-fold higher rate of spontaneous mutation, indicating that the exonuclease function may be required for mismatch repair (24Onel K. Thelen M.P. Ferguson D.O. Bennett R.L. Holloman W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5329-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the Rec1 protein appears bifunctional, having an N-terminal exonuclease domain and a C-terminal checkpoint domain. This type of separation of enzymatic and checkpoint domains has also been described for S. cerevisiae DNA polymerase ε (41Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The bifunctional nature is likely to be conserved in Hrad1A based upon our biochemical studies and the protein sequence similarity between Hrad1A and the U. maydis Rec1 protein. However, in humans we have identified an additional component, Hrad1B, which corresponds to the C-terminal region of Rec1 implicated solely in checkpoint control. We cannot discount the possibility that the alternatively spliced mRNA coding for Hrad1B is not translated. However, if the Hrad1B mRNA leads to the production of a protein, then what role might it play in DNA metabolism or checkpoint control? In fission yeast, rad1 is required for both the DNA damage- and DNA replication-dependent checkpoints, whereas inS. cerevisiae RAD17 is only required for the DNA damage-dependent checkpoint. It has been demonstrated that RAD17 functions in conjunction with RAD24 and MEC1 to activate DNA degradation (23Lydall D. Weinert T. Science. 1995; 270: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that there is a requirement to process single- or double-stranded breaks such that single-stranded DNA is exposed to activate the checkpoint (22Carr A.M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Lydall D. Weinert T. Science. 1995; 270: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). If we consider Hrad1 as part of a complex that acts as a surveillance mechanism monitoring the genome and communicating the presence of DNA damage or unreplicated DNA to the cell cycle machinery, then it is conceivable that in higher eukaryotes two types of surveillance complexes exist separating the DNA damage- and DNA replication-dependent checkpoint pathways. Hrad1A could be specifically required for the DNA damage-dependent checkpoint, able to monitor the genome via the C-terminal checkpoint domain and process single- and double-stranded breaks via the N-terminal exonuclease domain. A link between the mismatch repair system and the DNA damage-dependent checkpoint has been demonstrated (42Hawn M.T. Umar A. Carethers J.M. Marra G. Kunkel T.A. Boland R. Koi M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3721-3725PubMed Google Scholar). Hrad1B may have a function in the DNA replication-dependent checkpoint that might require only the monitoring activity and not the nuclease function to identify replication forks. Hrad1B also contains the sequence shown to be essential for checkpoint function in a mutational analysis of S. pombe Rad1 (43Kanter-Smoler G. Knudsen K.E. Jimenez G. Sunnerhagen P. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1793-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The increase in transcription that we observed in testis could also signify a role for Hrad1B in meiotic recombination in conjunction with ATR and ATM.The loss of checkpoint function has been shown to lead to genomic instability even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage (44Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In humans, the p53 gene and the ATM gene are not only required for the G1-S phase checkpoint (45Yin Y. Tainsky M.A. Bischoff F.Z. Strong L.C. Wahl G.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 46Livingstone L.R. White A. Sprouse J. Livanos E. Jacks T.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 48Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Diery W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). It is likely that other checkpoint genes will act as tumor suppressors. The Hrad1gene is located on chromosome 5p13.2–13.3. Loss of heterozygosity of this region of chromosome 5 has been associated with a tumor suppressor function most notably in human lung cancer (37Wieland I. Bohm M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1772-1774PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wieland I. Bohm M. Arden K.C. Ammermuller T. Bogatz S. Viars C.S. Rajewsky M.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 97-102PubMed Google Scholar). The CDK2/cyclin A-associated protein p45 (SKP2) has been mapped to 5p13 (51Demetrick D.J. Zhang H. Beach D. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 73: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), butHrad1 should also be considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in this region.The precise roles that Hrad1A and Hrad1B play in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and tumor suppression remain to be determined. This study represents a starting point to begin to unravel the potential multiple roles for the Hrad1 gene product. For any dividing cell it is essential to maintain the integrity of the genome ensuring that DNA replication occurs once per cell cycle and that identical chromosomal copies are distributed equally to two daughter cells at mitosis. When cells are subjected to conditions that interfere with DNA replication or spindle assembly or that cause damage to DNA, cell-cycle progression halts, permitting cell cycle phase completion or DNA repair. These control mechanisms are referred to as “checkpoints” (reviewed in Refs. 1Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar, 2Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar, 3Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). The loss of checkpoint control in mammalian cells, most notably through the inactivation of p53, results in genomic instability leading to the amplification, rearrangement, or loss of chromosomes, events that commonly occur in cancer cells (2Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar, 4Hartwell L. Cell. 1992; 71: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Much of our current knowledge about checkpoint control has been obtained from studies using budding (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) yeast (reviewed in Ref. 5Carr A.M. Hoekstra M.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 32-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the fission yeast at least two distinct checkpoint pathways have been identified: the DNA replication-dependent checkpoint pathway that ensures that S phase is completed before M phase is initiated and the DNA damage-dependent checkpoint pathway that acts to halt the cell cycle when genomic integrity is compromised (5Carr A.M. Hoekstra M.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 32-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The products of six genes, rad1+, rad3+,rad9+, rad17+,rad26+, and hus1+, have been identified in S. pombe as essential components of both checkpoint pathways (5Carr A.M. Hoekstra M.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 32-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae the two checkpoint pathways are genetically separable; four gene products, RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and MEC3, have been identified as essential for the DNA damage-dependent checkpoint pathway, and three gene products, POL2, RFC5, and DPB11, are essential for the DNA replication-dependent checkpoint pathway (reviewed in Refs.3Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 4Hartwell L. Cell. 1992; 71: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 5Carr A.M. Hoekstra M.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 32-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Several of the S. pombe checkpoint genes have structural homologues in the budding yeast and further conservation across eukaryotes has recently been demonstrated with the cloning of two human homologues of S. pombe rad3+, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) (6Savitsky K.

This toxin also hemolyzes sheep erythrocytes by a mechanism presumed to include pore formation and osmotic lysis. Intoxication and hemolysis appear at strikingly different toxin concentrations and evolve over different time scales, suggesting that different molecular processes may be involved. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that intoxication and hemolysis occur by distinct mechanisms.Although the hemolytic activity of AC toxin has a lag of >1 h, intoxication starts immediately. Because of this difference, we sought a surrogate or precursor lesion that leads to hemolysis, and potassium efflux has been observed from erythrocytes treated with other pore-forming toxins. AC toxin elicits an increase in K+efflux from sheep erythrocytes and Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia line, that begins within minutes of toxin addition. The toxin concentration dependence along with the analysis of the time course suggest that toxin monomers are sufficient to elicit release of K+ and to deliver the catalytic domain to the cell interior. Hemolysis, on the other hand, is a highly cooperative event that likely requires a subsequent oligomerization of these individual units. Although induction of K+ efflux shares some structural and environmental requirements with both intoxication and hemolysis, it can occur under conditions in which intoxication is reduced or prevented. The data presented here suggest that the transmembrane pathway by which K+ is released is separate and distinct from the structure required for intoxication but may be related to, or a precursor of, that which is ultimately responsible for hemolysis.

Inside the cell AC toxin binds endogenous calmodulin, resulting in a 1000-fold increase in its enzymatic activity and production of supraphysiologic levels of intracellular cAMP from host ATP (9Berkowitz S.A.

Both of these activities are attributed to the C-terminal end of AC toxin that is homologous to Escherichia coli hemolysin and other members of the RTX family of bacterial toxins (13Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 269: 22239-27231Google Scholar, 14Welch R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 15Coote J.G.

Intoxication and hemolysis require post-translational acylation of the toxin at one or two internal lysine residues, which converts the inactive protoxin to the active form (8Hackett M. Guo L.

Acylation appears to occur within the bacterium and is dependent on the product of a separate gene,cyaC (17Barry E.M. Weiss A.A. Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. Goodwin M.S. J.

Hormozi K. da Costa C.N. Parton R. Coote J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with other hemolysins, AC toxin has been shown to produce transmembrane ion conductance in artificial lipid bilayers, and the properties of the responsible structure have been investigated (13Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 269: 22239-27231Google Scholar,21Szabo G. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22496-22499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that pore formation is calcium-dependent, as are intoxication and hemolysis, and have demonstrated that this activity has a cubic or higher concentration dependence, suggesting that an oligomer is the active species (21Szabo G. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22496-22499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Benz et al. (13Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 269: 22239-27231Google Scholar) studied the single channel properties of the pore formed by AC toxin and found it to be cation-selective and considerably smaller than that of E. coli hemolysin. In keeping with that observation, the hemolytic activity of AC toxin is modest, relative to E. colihemolysin or other RTX hemolysins (13Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 269: 22239-27231Google Scholar, 14Welch R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The time course is prolonged (hours rather than minutes), and the concentration required to elicit >90% hemolysis is high, in the 10 μg/ml range (22Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Gordon V.M. Gray L.S. Hewlett E.L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). By using the method of osmotic solute exclusion, Ehrmann et al.(22Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Gordon V.M. Gray L.S. Hewlett E.L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) estimated the pore created by AC toxin to be <0.6 nm, which is significantly smaller than the 2–3 nm estimated for E. colihemolysin (23Bhakdi S. Greulich S. Muhly M. Eberspacher B. Becker H. Thiele A. Hugo F. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 737-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A major focus of our work has been to determine the sequence of events involved in AC toxin's interaction with target cells and the relationships among these activities. The onset of intoxication is rapid and maximal in 30–60 min at toxin concentrations of about 1 μg/ml (22Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Gordon V.M. Gray L.S. Hewlett E.L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Otero A.S. Yi X.B. Gray M.C. Szabo G. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9695-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the hemolytic activity of AC toxin demonstrates a lag of >1 h even at toxin concentrations of 10 μg/ml (22Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Gordon V.M. Gray L.S. Hewlett E.L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The significant difference in both time course and concentration dependence for intoxication and hemolysis suggested to us that these two processes occur by different mechanisms. In order to address this, we hypothesized that there might be an earlier event in the course of toxin-cell interaction that is an antecedent of hemolysis. Potassium efflux has been used previously to measure pore formation by toxins and other proteins that traverse cell membranes (25Madoff M.A. Cooper L.Z. Weinstein L. J. Bacteriol. 1964; 87: 145-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jorgensen S.E. Mulcahy P.F. Wu G.K. Louis C.F. Toxicon. 1983; 21: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Bhakdi S.

Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1994; 16: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This efflux of K+ has been shown to be rapid in onset and to precede cell swelling and eventual lysis. Potassium is present inside the cell at concentrations greater than 100 mm and can be measured simply and directly in the culture medium by flame photometry. By using this method, we have found that AC toxin-treated sheep erythrocytes release K+ with an onset comparable to that of intoxication. The toxin concentration dependence of K+efflux is a first order process, suggesting that a monomer is responsible. Whereas intoxication has a similar concentration dependence, hemolysis shows a cubic or higher power dependence, suggesting that an oligomer is necessary. Potassium efflux can be dissociated from intoxication because it occurs under conditions in which intoxication is reduced or prevented. These results suggest that K+ efflux is an early event in toxin-cell interaction that can be dissociated from intoxication. This process may reflect the initial insertion of the toxin monomer into the target cell membrane in a process culminating in toxin oligomerization and hemolysis. Production of recombinant AC toxin was done as described previously (33Sebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. E. coli BL21 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing plasmid pT7CACT1 for expression of wild type AC toxin, or plasmid pACT7 for production of CyaC− AC toxin, were grown to an optical density of 0.2 at 600 nm at 37 °C in 2× YT medium (1.6% Bacto-tryptone, 1% Bacto-yeast, 85 mm NaCl) containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to the cultures which were incubated an additional 4 h. Cultures were centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was stored at −70 °C overnight. Pellets were resuspended in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, sonicated, and extracted with 8 m urea. Urea-extracted AC toxin was purified on a calmodulin affinity column as described previously (34Hewlett E.L. Gray L. Allietta M. Ehrmann I. Gordon V.M. Gray M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17503-17508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). B. pertussis strain BPLME58IE (11Ehrmann I. Weiss A. Goodwin M.S. Gray M.C. Barry E. Hewlett E.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was grown, and the toxin was purified as described previously (34Hewlett E.L. Gray L. Allietta M. Ehrmann I. Gordon V.M. Gray M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17503-17508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AC toxin was stored at −70 °C in 8 m urea, 10 mm Tricine, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmEGTA, pH 8.0. AC activity was measured by the conversion of [32P]ATP to [32P]cAMP as described previously (35Hewlett E.L. Gordon V.M. McCaffery J.D. Sutherland W.M. Gray M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19379-19384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hewlett E.L. Urban M.A. Manclark C.R. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1926-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, each assay tube contained 60 mm Tricine, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, with 2 × 105cpm of [α-32P]ATP and 1 μm calmodulin at pH 8.0. All buffers and samples were equilibrated to 0–2 °C or 37 °C as indicated. The reaction was initiated with the addition of [α-32P]ATP and carried out in an ice bath at 0–2 °C or at 37 °C for 10, 20, and 30 min. This reaction was terminated by the addition of a solution containing 1% SDS, 20 mm ATP, and 6.24 mm cAMP (with 1.5 × 104 to 2.0 × 104 cpm of [3H]cAMP). Cyclic AMP was separated from substrate ATP by the double column method of Salomonet al. (37Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar), and enzymatic activity was determined by measuring [32P]cAMP in a scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Blood was drawn into a flask containing Alsever's Solution and immediately placed on ice. Within 30 min of obtaining it, the blood was centrifuged, and the serum and buffy coat were removed. Erythrocytes were washed 3 times in Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.4 (HBSS), and the hematocrit was adjusted to 40% (approximately 1010 RBC/ml). Erythrocytes were used within 2 days. AC toxin activity was measured by incubating 1 ml of erythrocytes at a 40% hematocrit with AC toxin at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. Cells were then centrifuged, the pellet washed 3 times in HBSS, and 10% trichloroacetic acid added to lyse the cells and precipitate the hemoglobin. The supernatant (400 μl) containing the cellular cAMP was removed and extracted 3 times with H2O-saturated ether to remove residual trichloroacetic acid. HCl was added to yield a final concentration of 0.1n, and cAMP was measured by an automated radioimmunoassay (38Brooker G. Harper J.F. Terasaki W.L. Moylan R.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 1-33PubMed Google Scholar). Hemolytic activity and K+ efflux were measured by incubating 1 ml of erythrocytes at a 40% hematocrit with AC toxin for the indicated amount of time. Cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was used to measure hemolysis as described previously (22Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Gordon V.M. Gray L.S. Hewlett E.L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and K+efflux, using an Instrumentation Laboratory model IL943 flame photometer. In experiments comparing K+ efflux with hemolysis, control cells were lysed to determine the total K+ present; AC toxin-induced K+ efflux is reported as a percent of total using Equation 1. K+efflux of AC toxin­treated sample−K+efflux of control cellstotal K+after cell lysis−K+efflux of control cellsEquation 1 In all other situations, K+ efflux was expressed as mmol/liter, with K+ efflux from control cells typically being 5.2–6.7 mmol/liter. For K+ efflux in Jurkat cells, 2 × 107 cells/500 μl were incubated with AC toxin for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were centrifuged and the supernatant collected to measure K+ efflux. After initial incubation of erythrocytes with AC toxin, cells were washed 3 times in HBSS, treated with 1 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 20 min at 0–2 °C, and the reaction stopped with 2 mg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Control cells were treated with trypsin inhibitor first and then trypsin. Where indicated, cells were washed 2 times, resuspended to 40% hematocrit, and incubated an additional 30 min at 37 °C. AC toxin, which is stored in 8 m urea, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA was renatured by a >15-fold dilution of toxin solution into HBSS. The urea concentration present after this dilution was <500 mm and free calcium concentration was 1.1 mm. The time courses of intoxication, K+ efflux, and hemolysis shown in Fig. 1 were fitted by Equation 2. α(1−exp(−t/τ))nEquation 2 where t is time, τ is the time constant of the rise of effect, α is the amplitude of the effect, and n is a parameter related to the stoichiometry of the molecular complex involved in this process. A value of n = 1 corresponds to a simple exponential rise expected for a first order process. Larger values of n are expected when several molecules must combine to form a functional complex. Nonlinear curve fitting was carried out using the program Origin (Microcal Software). The resulting fits are shown as solid lines, and the corresponding parameters are given in the figure legends. An analogous procedure was used to fit the Hill equation to the data of Fig. 3. The difference in onset of intoxication and hemolysis has made it difficult to determine the relationship between these two functional activities of AC toxin and suggests that they occur by different mechanisms. In studies using erythrocytes, addition of other pore-forming toxins has been shown to cause a rapid release of K+ which was followed by cell swelling and eventual lysis. That is to say, efflux of K+ can be used as a diagnostic tool to measure increases in membrane permeability and is thought to represent the initial manifestation of the transmembrane pore that is responsible for ultimate osmotic lysis (25Madoff M.A. Cooper L.Z.

Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1994; 16: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present study, we hypothesized that K+ efflux would occur in erythrocytes treated with AC toxin and that it would precede hemolysis. The timing of K+ efflux from AC toxin-treated sheep erythrocytes in relation to intoxication or hemolysis is illustrated in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. Both intoxication and K+ efflux (Fig. 1 A) exhibit virtually immediate onset with first order kinetics. In comparison, hemolysis is delayed and negligible in magnitude for periods as long as 90 min even at a high toxin concentration (20 μg/ml) (Fig. 1 B). These data clearly suggest that K+ efflux is an indicator of toxin-mediated membrane perturbation, which precedes hemolysis and is associated temporally with intoxication. As shown in Fig. 2, AC toxin also elicits K+release from Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia line that is not lysed by AC toxin. This observation indicates that the process resulting in K+ efflux is not restricted to non-nucleated cells or cells such as erythrocytes that are lysed by AC toxin. In light of these observations, it was important to characterize in depth K+ efflux as a consequence of AC toxin interaction with target cells. In order to determine relevance of this phenomenon to hemolysis, sheep erythrocytes were chosen for use in subsequent experiments as the model system. To examine more closely the relationship between K+ release and hemolysis, we evaluated the concentrations of toxin required for these two activities and compared them to that necessary for intoxication. The concentration dependences of intoxication and K+ efflux at 30 min and hemolysis at 4.5 h are shown in Fig. 3. The differences between intoxication or K+ efflux and hemolysis are striking. A quantitative assessment of these differences was obtained by fitting the data to the Hill equation, shown as solid lines. Intoxication and K+ efflux demonstrate Hill coefficients near unity (n = 1.39 ± 0.10 and 0.82 ± 0.04 respectively), whereas that for hemolysis is markedly higher (n = 4.99 ± 0.71), suggesting cooperativity as observed previously (21Szabo G. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22496-22499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data along with the analysis of the time course strongly suggest that toxin monomers are sufficient to elicit release of K+ and the delivery of the catalytic domain to the cell interior. Hemolysis, on the other hand, is a highly cooperative event that likely requires a subsequent oligomerization of these individual units. In light of the discrepancy between the stoichiometry for K+ efflux and hemolysis, processes that were expected to be closely linked, we began an investigation to compare and contrast K+ efflux with intoxication and hemolysis. Both intoxication and hemolysis require acylation of an internal lysine residue in a process mediated by CyaC (8Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 16Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van Cuyk S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Sebo P. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 720-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 4 demonstrate that non-acylated protoxin (CyaC−) does not elicit K+ efflux even at toxin concentrations of 20 μg/ml. Thus, acylation is necessary for all three activities. The amino acid sequence of AC toxin includes approximately 41 copies of a nonameric, glycine, and aspartic acid-containing motif that is involved in calcium binding in other bacterial proteins (6Glaser P. Ladant D. Sezer O. Pichot F. Ullmann A. Danchin A. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 14Welch R. Mol.

The functional importance of this domain is illustrated by the observation that extracellular calcium is necessary for intoxication and hemolysis (34Hewlett E.L. Gray L. Allietta M. Ehrmann I.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3154-3161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have observed that toxin prepared in the presence of calcium, but assayed in the presence of the calcium chelator EGTA, is able to induce hemolysis but not intoxication. Roseet al. (43Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) suggested that AC toxin contains approximately 45 low affinity binding sites for calcium and another 3–5 high affinity sites (43Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Calcium bound to these few high affinity sites has been postulated to be responsible for the hemolytic activity of AC toxin when assayed in the presence of calcium chelators. As shown in Fig. 4, when AC toxin is exposed to calcium before addition to sheep RBC in the presence of EDTA, K+ efflux was 71% that induced by AC toxin assayed with sheep erythrocytes in the presence of calcium. In contrast, AC toxin exposed to calcium but incubated with RBC in EDTA, increased intracellular cAMP <1% that observed in RBC assayed in the presence of calcium (data not shown). These latter observations are comparable with those reported previously (10Rogel A. Meller R. Hanski E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3154-3161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Rose T. Sebo P. Bellalou J. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26370-26376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and suggest that calcium occupancy of both high and low affinity sites is necessary for intoxication, whereas occupancy of the high affinity sites alone is sufficient for both K+ release and hemolysis. Differences in calcium requirement notwithstanding, similarities in time course and concentration dependence of intoxication and K+ efflux raised the question of how these two activities are related. It has been shown previously that exposure of AC toxin to calmodulin prior to its addition to erythrocytes markedly inhibits intoxication (10Rogel A. Meller R. Hanski E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3154-3161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Shattuck R.L. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6323-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 45Gentile F. Raptis A.

https://openalex.org/W1972718227,"Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA contains 10 pseudouridines, one in the 16 S RNA and nine in the 23 S RNA. Previously, the gene for the synthase responsible for the 16 S RNA pseudouridine was identified and cloned, as was a gene for a synthase that makes a single pseudouridine in 23 S RNA. The yceCopen reading frame of E. coli is one of a set of genes homologous to these previously identified ribosomal RNA pseudouridine synthases. In this work, the gene was cloned, overexpressed, and shown to code for a pseudouridine synthase able to react with in vitro transcripts of 23 S ribosomal RNA. Deletion of the gene and analysis of the 23 S RNA from the deletion strain for the presence of pseudouridine at its nine known sites revealed that this synthase is solely responsible in vivo for the synthesis of three of the nine pseudouridine residues, at positions 955, 2504, and 2580. Therefore, this gene has been renamed rluC. Despite the absence of one-third of the normal complement of pseudouridines, there was no change in the exponential growth rate in either LB or M-9 medium at temperatures ranging from 24 to 42 °C. From this work and our previous studies, we have now identified three synthases that account for 50% of the pseudouridines in the E. coli ribosome.

In this work, the gene was cloned, overexpressed, and shown to code for a pseudouridine synthase able to react with in vitro transcripts of 23 S ribosomal RNA. Deletion of the gene and analysis of the 23 S RNA from the deletion strain for the presence of pseudouridine at its nine known sites revealed that this synthase is solely responsible in vivo for the synthesis of three of the nine pseudouridine residues, at positions 955, 2504, and 2580. Therefore, this gene has been renamed rluC. Despite the absence of one-third of the normal complement of pseudouridines, there was no change in the exponential growth rate in either LB or M-9 medium at temperatures ranging from 24 to 42 °C. From this work and our previous studies, we have now identified three synthases that account for 50% of the pseudouridines in the E. coli ribosome. Pseudouridine (Ψ), 1The abbreviations used are: Ψ, pseudouridine(s); rRNA, ribosomal RNA; SSU, small subunit; LSU, large subunit; ORF, open reading frame; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s). the 5-ribosyl isomer of uridine, occurs in rRNA (1Maden B.E.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), and small nuclear and nucleolar RNA (3Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R.

C.1998: 201-227Google Scholar) but not in mRNA or viral genomic RNAs. All the RNAs in which Ψ is found share a common characteristic, namely a tertiary structure that must be maintained for proper function. Ψ is made after the polynucleotide chain has been formed by an enzyme-catalyzed but energy-independent isomerization of uridine (reviewed in Ref. 5Ofengand J. Fournier M. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 229-253Google Scholar). A considerable amount of Ψ is found in ribosomal RNA approaching 8% of the uridines in mammals (6Ofengand J. Bakin A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 246-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The number and distribution of Ψ is different between the two large rRNAs. In small subunit (SSU) RNA, the number varies from 0 or 1 (yeast mitochondria) to 1 (Escherichia coli) to ∼40 (mammals), and Ψ are deployed throughout the molecule, whereas in the large subunit (LSU) RNA, although there is also a wide variation in the number of Ψ from 1 (yeast mitochondria) to 4–9 (prokaryotes) to 55–57 (mammals), the distribution is conserved in all organisms to three defined secondary structural regions at or near the peptidyl transferase center (reviewed in Ref. 5Ofengand J. Fournier M. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 229-253Google Scholar). In E. coli, the organism studied in this work, there are 10 Ψ residues, one in the SSU RNA at position 516 (7Bakin A. Kowalak J.A. McCloskey J.A. Ofengand J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3681-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and nine in the LSU RNA at positions 746, 955, 1911, 1915, 1917, 2457, 2504, 2580, and 2605 (8Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 9Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13475-13483Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ψ1915 is further modified by methylation at N3 (10Kowalak J.A. Bruenger E. Hashizume T. Peltier J.M. Ofengand J. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite the specificity implicit in the conservation of geographic localization in the LSU to the functionally important peptidyl transferase center, there is no known role for Ψ in the ribosome. To address this issue, we have embarked on a program to identify all of the synthases responsible for formation of the 10 Ψ in E. coli rRNA with the aim of deleting specific Ψ residues by inactivating the genes for the corresponding synthases. So far,rsuA, the gene for the synthase responsible for forming Ψ516 in 16 S RNA (11Wrzesinski J. Bakin A. Nurse K. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8904-8913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and rluA, the gene for the synthase that makes Ψ746 in LSU RNA (12Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA. 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar), have been identified. In this work we show that the gene yceC, renamed rluC, makes the synthase responsible for formation of Ψ at positions 955, 2504, and 2580. Deletion of this gene and thus the absence of these three Ψ residues has no detectable effect on the exponential growth rate in either rich or minimal glucose medium at temperatures ranging from 24 to 42 °C. The yceC gene was deleted by the method of Hamilton et al. (13Hamilton C.M. Aldea H. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The insert cloned into the KpnI and XbaI sites of pMAK705 was prepared by PCR as described by Nelson and co-workers (see Fig. 2 in Ref. 14Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It contained 841 bases 5′ to the AUG start and 870 bases 3′ to the UAA termination codon. 39 bases of the N-terminal portion of the gene and 49 bases of the C terminus were retained with the remainder being replaced by the kanamycin resistance gene, obtained by PCR amplification from pUC4K (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, catalog number 27-4958-01). The host strain for pMAK705 was MC1061 as described by Hamilton et al. (13Hamilton C.M. Aldea H. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deleted yceC gene was moved into strain SJ134 (Ref. 15Hall B.G. J.

A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 357-364Google Scholar). This plasmid (pLG338/yceC) was constructed by insertion into the SmaI site of pLG338 (18Stoker N.G. Fairweather N.F. Spratt B.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1982; 18: 3353-3413Google Scholar) of a PCR-amplified fragment of DNA starting 116 bases 5′ to the AUG initiator of yceC and ending 124 nucleotides 3′ to the termination codon. This insertion site inactivates the KanRgene of the plasmid. The construct includes the 71-base promoter, 45-base spacer, 960-base gene, 77-base spacer, 44-base termination sequence, and 3 bases beyond. pLG338 also carries a tetracycline resistance gene. Putative promoter and terminator sequences were identified by examination of the upstream and downstream regions. For the promoter, a web site was used. 2A. M. Huerta, H. Salgado, and J. Collado-Vides, www.cifn.unam.mx/Computational_Biology/E.coli-predictions/. The terminator sequence was located visually and verified by folding using M-fold version 3.0 (19Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Zuker M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 281-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). 3www.ibc.wustl.edu/∼zuker/rna. Transformants ofyceC-deleted SJ134 and of wild type andyceC-deleted MG1655 with pLG338 and pLG338/yceCwere selected by tetracycline resistance. All growth media contained 10 μg/ml tetracycline to retain the plasmid in the tetracycline-sensitive host cells. Ψ sequencing was performed as described previously (8Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 20Bakin A Ofengand J. Methods in Molecular Biology: Protein Synthesis: Methods and Protocols.in: Martin R. Chapter 22.

For the growth experiments, overnight cultures at 37 °C in the medium to be tested were diluted 50-fold (minimal medium) or 100-fold (rich medium) and placed at the testing temperature. Cell density was monitored at 600 nm. From the amino acid sequences of RsuA and RluA, as well as those for two tRNA Ψ synthases, TruB (21Nurse K. Wrzesinski J. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J.

Five ORFs were identified in E. coli (Table I). A sixth ORF,ymfC, was found subsequently when the entire E. coli genome sequence became available. The ORFs could be divided into four subfamilies based on their sequence motifs (23Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 24Gustafsson C.

By chance, the sequences of the four initially identified genes happened to define each of the four subclasses. Note, however, that the six putative synthase genes subsequently identified are all in class A or B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3756-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we selected this ORF for our initial study. The gene was cloned, the protein was overexpressed, and Ψ formation activity was detected using 5-[3H]uridine-labeled 23 S RNA as anin vitro substrate, confirming that this gene product was indeed a Ψ synthase. To determine the specificity of the synthase under in vivo conditions, the gene was deleted by insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene (13Hamilton C.M. Aldea H. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Verification of gene deletion was done by PCR amplification from the N and C termini of theyceC gene in the chromosomal DNA of the deletion mutant. The wild type control gave the expected 1.0-kb band, whereas the mutant supposed to contain the KanR insert was, as expected, 1.4 kb in size. Further evidence was obtained by amplification from the N and C termini of the KanR gene. The mutant gave the expected 1.3-kb band, but nothing was obtained from the wild type. Preliminary Ψ sequence analysis showed the absence of Ψ 955, 2504, and 2580 as a result of this single gene deletion. For further experiments, the deleted gene was transferred by P1 transduction (17Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 357-364Google Scholar) into strain SJ134. Mutant cells were then transformed with a low copy number plasmid, pLG338 (18Stoker N.G. Fairweather N.F. Spratt B.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1982; 18: 3353-3413Google Scholar), or a rescue plasmid, pLG338 containing the yceC gene inserted at itsSmaI site, creating strainsyceC−(pLG338) and yceC−(pLG338/yceC). The yceC gene insert included the putative yceC gene promoter and terminator elements, and there were no other apparent ORFs in this operon. Because pLG338 carries a tetracycline resistance gene, the plasmid-containing cultures were grown in the presence of tetracycline to retain the plasmid in its tetracycline-sensitive host strain. Ribosomal RNA from the wild type and yceC-disrupted strain SJ134 and from the two transformed strains,yceC−(pLG338) andyceC−(pLG338/yceC), were isolated and sequenced for the presence of Ψ at the nine known sites in 23 S RNA (Fig. 1). This figure shows clearly that of the five Ψ shown, the deletion mutant is lacking Ψ at 955, 2504, and 2580 but not at 2457 or 2605. Because the bands for 2457 and 2605 are found in the same lanes as 2504 and 2580, respectively, they serve as effective internal controls for the absence of bands at 2504 and 2580. The other four Ψ, at positions 746, 1911, 1915, and 1917, were present in the mutant as well as the wild type (data not shown). When the deletion strain was supplemented with the rescue plasmid pLG338/yceC, but not with pLG338 alone, all three Ψ reappear. We conclude that the yceC gene makes a Ψ synthase that can recognize these three sites in 23 S RNA and that no other synthase in the cell can take over this function. In view of this result, we have renamed the gene rluC, ribosomallarge subunit pseudouridine synthaseC. The location of the nine Ψ sites in 23 S RNA and the five sites monitored in Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 2 A on the secondary structure of 23 S RNA, and in Fig. 2 B, the immediate vicinity of the three sites recognized by RluC are shown in expanded form. Clearly, the three sites are separated from each other and do not share any obvious common structural elements that would be suitable for recognition purposes. Deletion of these three Ψ residues from the ribosome was not lethal. To assess any more subtle metabolic defects, growth rates were measured at different temperatures in both rich and minimal glucose media (TableII). For this purpose, therluC deletion was moved by P1 transduction into strain MG1655, the same strain whose genome was sequenced by Blattner et al. (16Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6050) Google Scholar), to provide a well defined background. The MG1655 deletion strain was selected by its kanamycin resistance, and PCR amplification from the yceC termini confirmed the deletion (the expected 1.4-kb band was found instead of a 1.0-kb band for the wild type). Wild type and mutant MG1655 were transformed with both the rescue plasmid and its control. Exponential growth rates for all four strains are shown in Table II. Even though both rich and minimal media were tested over a range of temperature from 24 to 42 °C, no significant change in growth rate was observed. Moreover, no instance was found where the maximum cell density at stationary phase was limited by the deletion mutation. We conclude that at least under the described conditions, there is no effect of the loss of three of the nine Ψ present in the large subunit of the ribosome.Table IIGrowth rate of rluC deletion and rescue strainsStrainMediumDoubling timeaValues in parentheses are the number of exponential phase doublings over which the doubling time was measured.24 °C37 °C42 °CminMG1655/pLG338RichbLB broth (27).121 (2)25.3 (5)24.7 (3)MG1655/pLG338(rluC)RichbLB broth (27).123 (2)25.5 (5)24.5 (3)MG1655(rluC−)/pLG338RichbLB broth (27).122 (2)25.0 (5)25.0 (3)MG1655(rluC−)/pLG338(rluC)RichbLB broth (27).119 (2)25.3 (5)25.0 (3)MG1655/pLG338MinimalcM-9 (27) plus 0.4% glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.01 mg/ml tetracycline.282 (2)67.5 (3)57.9 (4)MG1655/pLG338(rluC)MinimalcM-9 (27) plus 0.4% glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.01 mg/ml tetracycline.287 (2)67.0 (3)59.4 (4)MG1655(rluC−)/pLG338MinimalcM-9 (27) plus 0.4% glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.01 mg/ml tetracycline.306 (2)71.5 (3)59.3 (4)MG1655(rluC−)/pLG338(rluC)MinimalcM-9 (27) plus 0.4% glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.01 mg/ml tetracycline.291 (2)70.7 (3)60.0 (4)a Values in parentheses are the number of exponential phase doublings over which the doubling time was measured.b LB broth (27Zyskind J.W.

Open table in a new tab In this work, we have shown that yceCis indeed a gene for a Ψ synthase and that its gene product is the only synthase which in vivo is capable of forming Ψ955, Ψ2504, and Ψ2580 in E. coli 23 S RNA. In view of its specificity, the gene has been renamed rluC. Because this work was done in vivo in the presence of all of the other Ψ synthases of the cell, it is clear that none of the other synthases share the specificity for positions 955, 2504, and 2580 with RluC. However, the reverse is not necessarily the case. RluC might share the ability with another synthase for recognition of one or more of the remaining Ψ sites. This can only be determined with certainty when all of the other rRNA Ψ synthases are identified and deleted. RluC does not share the ability to form Ψ516 in 16 S RNA with RsuA (TableI), because deletion of the rsuA gene blocks formation of Ψ516 in vivo. 4L. Niu and J. Ofengand, unpublished results. A possible dual specificity of recognition with one of the sites in tRNA, like that found for RluA (12Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA. 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar), has not yet been tested. Although all three sites for Ψ formation are well separated in the primary structure of 23 S RNA, 2504 and 2580, but not 955, approach each other when the RNA is folded into its secondary structure (Fig. 2 A). However, in the tertiary structure existing in the ribosome, Ψ955 is probably not far away either, because cross-linking results place A960 next to C2475 (28Dokudovskaya S. Dontsova O. Shpanchenko O. Bogdanov A. Brimacombe R. RNA. 1996; 2: 146-152PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest a possible mode of recognition of these three sites, which otherwise appear dissimilar in both sequence and secondary structure. Indeed, the only common structural element is that all three Us destined to be isomerized to Ψ are followed by a G residue. We postulate that any UG sequence within a given short distance of the catalytic center will be recognized. Thus if there is a tertiary structure of the 23 S RNA at some stage of ribosome biogenesis in which U955 is sufficiently close to the recognition site of the synthase, which must also be near to U2504 and U2580, it might be possible for the synthase to catalyze Ψ formation at all three sites. In this regard it should be noted that the closest other UG sequence to any of the three sites is 11 residues away at U2493. An alternative way to account for this unusual specificity would be for the synthase to possess separate polypeptide binding domains specific for each site that would each have the property that upon binding, the desired U residue would be brought into the catalytic center. No effect on exponential phase growth rate was found when Ψ955, 2504, and 2580 were absent, even when both medium and temperature were varied. Other growth parameters such as survival in stationary phase and the length of the lag phase were not examined in detail, but preliminary observations suggest that there is little or no effect (data not shown). In the absence of any such clues as to Ψ function, the ribosomes from Ψ-deficient cells will need to be examined for their ability to support the partial reactions of protein synthesis in vitro. This has been done previously to study the effects of rRNA mutations on ribosome function (29Cunningham P.R. Nurse K. Bakin A. Weitzmann C.J. Pflumm M. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12012-12022Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Santer M. Santer U. Nurse K. Bakin A. Cunningham P. Zain M. O'Connell D. Ofengand J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7172-7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Failure to find a physiological effect upon Ψ deletion is disappointing but not surprising. Neither the rsuA deletion strain mentioned above nor a strain with the rluA gene deleted showed any major metabolic defects,4 and deletion of various Ψ residues from yeast SSU and LSU RNAs by deletion of their guide RNAs also had no effect (reviewed in Ref. 5Ofengand J. Fournier M. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 229-253Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the geographic juxtaposition of at least two of these Ψ residues, namely 2504 and 2580, to sites known to be functionally important in peptide bond formation (reviewed in Ref. 6Ofengand J. Bakin A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 246-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) is a strong indication that these Ψ residues play an important, if still undiscovered, role. This conclusion is reinforced by the recent finding that of the four 23 S RNA residues whose chemical modification interferes with binding of tRNA to the ribosomal P site, U2506 and U2585 are within 2 and 5 bases, respectively, of Ψ2504 and Ψ2580 (35Bochetta M. Xiong L. Mankin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3525-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). TableIII summarizes the properties of all known cloned Ψ synthases and their genes. Table III includes synthases for E. coli and Bacillus subtilis rRNA and for E. coli and yeast tRNA. It is clear that the specificity of each synthase varies from being limited to one kind of RNA at one site to multiple sites in one class of RNA or even sites in different kinds of RNA. To help in categorizing these synthases and those still to be discovered, four specificity classes have been defined. Class I specificity is most stringent, in that only a single specific site in one kind of RNA is recognized. RsuA, RluB, TruB, and its homolog in yeast, Pus4p, are examples of this class. Class II defines those synthases that modify any U residue within a span of 5–6 nucleotides, but only in one kind of RNA. TruA and its yeast homolog, Pus3p, are examples. In class III, the specificity is relaxed even more, and distant sites become recognizable, although again only in the same class of RNA. Pus1p in yeast is an example of this type because it can recognize up to eight different sites in tRNA, and RluC is another example. Although both synthases recognize sites spread some distance apart, the maximum distance in the case of Pus1p is 41 residues, whereas for RluC it is 1625 nucleotides. Class IV specificity is reserved for those synthases that recognize specific single sites in more than one class of RNA, a property we have termed “dual specificity” (12Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA. 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar). So far, RluA is the only member of this class, but this may be at least in part because of the fact that testing for dual specificity is not straightforward because it requires a predetermination of which site in which RNA to test. The dual specificity of RluA was only discovered serendipitously.Table IIICloned rRNA and tRNA pseudouridine synthasesNameGene locationRNA substratePosition modifiedSpecificity classMonomer mass of ORFNumber of amino acidsSWISS-PROT Accession NumberReferencekDaRsuA (E.c.)49.12 min16 S rRNA516I25.9231P3391811Wrzesinski J.

The intriguing RNA recognition properties of the RluC synthase coupled with the ease of overexpression of the recombinant enzyme with demonstrable Ψ formation activity of appropriate specificity make this protein a logical candidate for x-ray crystallographic analysis.

Unlike other RGS proteins such as RGS9, RGS-GAIP, and Sst2p, which have been reported to be largely membrane-associated, a majority of cellular RGS4 is found as a soluble protein in the cytoplasm. However, the expression of a GTPase-deficient Giα subunit (Giα2-Q204L) resulted in the translocation of both wild type RGS4 and a non-Giα-binding mutant (L159F) to the plasma membrane. These data suggest that RGS4 may be recruited to the plasma membrane indirectly by G-protein activation and that multiple RGS proteins within a given cell might be differentially localized to determine a physiologic response to a G-protein-linked stimulus.

Numerous biological processes such as vision, olfaction, and many hormonal responses generate signals that are transduced through heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide (GTP)-binding proteins (G-proteins) (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanisms that control G-protein signaling intracellularly have not been well characterized, but the variability of signal strength and the specificity of a given stimulus among different cell types suggest that cell type-specific interacting proteins participate (2Sato M.

A newly discovered family of regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS proteins) 1The abbreviations used are: RGS, regulators of G-protein signaling; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin. may play a role in cell type-specific desensitization. RGS proteins were originally identified by genetic complementation of a yeast homologue (Sst2p) and by the identification of a closely related homologue inCaenorhabditis elegans (EGL10) that regulated G-protein signaling (3DeVries L.

Subsequently, transfection experiments and biochemical studies with recombinant proteins have shown that RGS family members likely down-regulate signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by acting as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for some heterotrimeric G-protein α-subunits (7Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 8Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Although several RGS proteins such as RGS1, RGS4, RGS10, and RGS-GAIP accelerate the GTPase activity of Giα subunits with apparently similar ability, the precise affinities of the various RGS proteins for individual Gα subunits is only slowly emerging, and almost nothing is known about the physiologic regulation of these proteins (8Berman D.M.

Although previous studies documented the inability of RGS1, RGS4, and RGS-GAIP to enhance Gsα or G12α GTPase activity (7Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 8Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 38: 172-175Crossref Scopus (478) Google Scholar), recent experiments have demonstrated that either recombinant RGS4 or RGS-GAIP accelerates GTP hydrolysis by Gqα in reconstituted GPCR-G-protein phospholipid vesicles and inhibits second messenger generation through a Gqα-coupled GPCR when added to membranes prepared from the neural cell line NG108-15 (11Hepler J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In addition, either the transient expression of RGS4 in COS-7 cells or its permanent expression in HEK293 cells inhibits Gq-mediated signaling (12Yan Y. Chi P.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11924-11927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in COS-7 cells transfected with the GnRH receptor, which also couples to Gqα, was markedly inhibited by RGS3 but not by RGS4 (14Neill J.D. Duck L.W. Sellers J.C. Musgrove L.C. Scheschonka A. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The apparent failure of RGS4 to impair GnRH Gq-mediated signaling could be explained if insufficient levels of RGS4 localized at the plasma membrane, especially because a relatively low amount of the RGS4 expression plasmid (0.8 μg) was used. In accord with this possibility, we show in this study that the majority of RGS4 localizes to the cytoplasmic compartment and not at the plasma membrane, in both transfected cells and in the NG108-15 cell line. This result contrasts with the RGS family members GAIP, RGS9, and the yeast RGS homologue Sst2p, which have been reported to be predominantly membrane-associated (5Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15DeVries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L.Z. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, we found that co-expression of a GTPase-deficient Giα mutant (Giα2Q207L) shifted both the cytoplasmic wild type RGS4 and a non-Giα-binding mutant of RGS4 (L159F) to the plasma membrane. These results indicate that some RGS proteins may be recruited from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane to modulate G-protein-mediated signaling pathways and that this shift might be an indirect result of the activation of Gα subunits rather than a simple physical association. PC12 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum at 37 °C. The 293T cells were the kind gift of David Baltimore. NG108-15 cells were obtained from Werner Klee (17Klee W.A. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3474-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine. The Burkitt lymphoma cell lines CA46 and MC116 were the kind gift of Dr. Ian Magrath (NCI, NIH), and the NALM-6 cell line was the gift of Dr. Thomas Tedder (Duke University). All suspension cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. NG108-15 cells were solubilized in a 1% C12E10-containing buffer. Cell lysates were then incubated with GDP alone (30 μm) or GDP and AlF4− (30 μm) for 30 min at room temperature. Recombinant His6 RGS4 (20 μg), prepared as described previously (9Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 38: 172-175Crossref Scopus (478) Google Scholar), was added to the lysates for 30 min at room temperature. 50 μl of nickel-nitriloacetic acid superflow beads (Qiagen) was then added for an additional 20 min. After three washes with buffer, bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. After fractionation on a 10% SDS gel, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and immunoblotted for various Gα subunits using antisera against Giα1–2(the kind gift of Allen Spiegel and Paul Goldsmith, NIDDK, NIH), Goα, Gqα, G12α (Santa Cruz), or Gsα (Calbiochem). Antibodies to rat RGS4 were generated by immunizing rabbits with an N-terminal peptide unique to RGS4 among mammalian RGS proteins (LRASAKDMKHRLGFLC) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. For immunoblotting, the cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h on ice, and the detergent-insoluble fraction was removed by microcentrifugation. 75–150 μg of protein was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 10% milk in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h and then incubated with the appropriate antibody for 2 h. For peptide blocking studies, the antisera were incubated with a control peptide (FLAG) or the immunizing peptide for 30 min at room temperature before dilution of the antibody. The final concentration of the peptide was 10 μg/ml. The blots were washed twice with TTBS before the addition of a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (DAKO). Following a 1-h incubation, the blot was washed twice with TTBS and then incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO). The signal was detected by ECL following the recommendations of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For cell fractionation, the method of Chakrabarti (18Chakrabarti R. Joly M. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was used. The anti-syntaxin antibody was the gift of Paul Roche (NCI, NIH), and the pan 14-3-3 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture dishes containing glass coverslips. Cells were fixed in 50% methanol/50% acetone for 1 h at 4 °C. Fixed cells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS plus 10% goat serum and 2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated with the appropriate antiserum for 2 h at room temperature. Following two washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Tago) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS, air-dried, mounted on silanized glass slides, and examined under the fluorescence microscope. NG108-15 cells were plated on ThermanoxTM (Nunc) coverslips, fixed in 0.1 mlysine-HCl-NaP04/0.1% glutaraldehyde, and then incubated with the preimmune control or RGS4 antiserum in PBS/0.005% saponin for 2 h. The cells were secondarily labeled with sheep anti-rabbit IgG Fab (Jackson Laboratories) in PBS/0.005% saponin for 1 h at room temperature. After three rinses with PBS, the cells were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde/0.1 m NaCacodylate/5% sucrose for 1 h at room temperature. ImmunoPure Metal Enhanced DAB substrate (Pierce) was then added for 5 min at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde/0.1 m cacodylate and processed for electron microscopy essentially as described by Scidmoreet al. (19Scidmore M.A. Fischer E.R. Hackstadt T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After euthanization, rat brains were rapidly removed and frozen in isopentane (Fluka) chilled on dry ice. Brains were cut in 12-μm sections on a cryostat (Frigocut 2800E, Cambridge Instruments) and thaw-mounted onto gelatin/chrome alum-subbed slides. Slides were post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde/0.9% NaCl for 10 min, acetylated in fresh 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 triethanolamine/0.9% NaCl, pH 8, for 10 min, dehydrated in an ascending series of alcohols, delipidated in chloroform, and then rehydrated in a descending series of alcohols. Slides were air dried and stored at −20 °C. Oligonucleotide probes were generated complementary to bases 61–100 and 661–700 of the published rat RGS4 cDNA (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and diluted in hybridization buffer (0.6 mNaCl, 80 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.2% SDS, 0.02% heparin sulfate, 50% formamide, 100 mm dithiothreitol) to obtain 2 × 106 cpm/100 ml. The probe was incubated with the rat forebrain sections for 12 h at 37 °C. The slides were then washed four times in 1× SSC at room temperature and then three times in 2× SSC/50% formamide at 40 °C. Slides were washed twice for 30 min in 1× SSC at room temperature, air dried, and applied to autoradiography film for 2 weeks at room temperature. Recombinant RGS1, RGS4, and RGS-GAIP bind both recombinant, purified G-protein α-subunits of the Gi subclass and G-proteins in bovine brain membrane fractions in vitro (9Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 38: 172-175Crossref Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The addition of GDP and tetrafluoroaluminate enhances binding severalfold, suggesting that RGS proteins bind to the transition state conformation of Gα to accelerate GTP hydrolysis. No RGS protein (including RGS4) has been reported to have GAP activity toward Gsα or G12α subunits. To examine the interaction of RGS4 with endogenous G-proteins, we used cell lysates from NG108-15 cells, which express high levels of RGS4 (see below). His-tagged RGS4 immobilized on nickel-nitriloacetic acid beads was used to pull down endogenous G-proteins in cellular lysates in the presence of GDP or GDP and AlF4− (Fig. 1). Strong interactions between RGS4 and Giα1–2 (using a cross-reactive antibody), Goα, and Gqα were found in the presence of GDP and AlF4−. In contrast, despite the abundance of both Gsα and G12α in these cells, we did not detect binding of RGS4 to either of these Gα subtypes. Because previous Northern blots had demonstratedRGS4 mRNA predominantly in the brain, we sought to identify RGS4 in neural cells and brain tissue (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To detect endogenous RGS4, we generated a polyclonal antiserum raised against a unique RGS4 peptide. The specificity of this antibody first was tested by immunoblotting cell lysates of 293T cells versus 293T cells transiently transfected with an HA-RGS4 plasmid (Fig. 2). Expression of HA-RGS4 was verified by blotting with HA antibody (left panel) and with the anti-RGS4 antiserum incubated with an unrelated peptide (middle panel), which both detected a band of approximately 30 kDa. In contrast, when the antiserum was incubated with the immunizing peptide prior to blotting, the RGS4 band was absent (right panel). Next, we screened lysates from various cell lines for RGS4 and detected an approximately 30-kDa band in lysates prepared from several cell lines, primarily those of neural origin (Fig. 3 A). One cell line expressed unusually high amounts of RGS4, the mouse glioblastoma × rat neuroblastoma cell line NG108-15. We had noted previously that these cells contained high amounts of RGS4mRNA. 2A. Scheschonka, unpublished observation. We did not detect RGS4 in fibroblast or hematopoietic cell lines with the exception of the pre-B cell line Nalm-6. To determine where RGS4 mRNA transcripts localized in the brain, we performed in situhybridization. Rat forebrain sections were processed for histochemistry and incubated with oligonucleotide probes (40 base pairs) complementary to bases 61–100 and 661–700 of the RGS4 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 3 B, prominent staining is seen in gray matter areas such as the cortex, striatum, and nucleus of the diagonal band. Labeling is low or absent in other forebrain neurons such as the globus pallidus, andRGS4 appears to be absent in white matter tracts such as the corpus callosum. These results are similar to those of Gold et al. (20Gold S.J. Ni Y.G. Dohlman H.G. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8024-8037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who found high expression of RGS4 mRNA in the neocortex, piriform cortex, caudoputamen, and ventrobasal thalamus.Figure 3Detection of endogenous RGS4 protein and mRNA in neural tissue. A, whole cell lysates of several lines were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Approximately 150 μg of protein was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with the antibody raised against an N-terminal RGS4 peptide. B, in situ hybridization histochemistry of RGS4 in rat brain. Film autoradiograph of coronal sections through the rat brain (upper panel, rostral to lower). Areas in which neuronal labeling occurs (black labeling on film) are cerebral cortex, striatum, and nucleus of the diagonal band (nDB). Labeling is absent or low in other forebrain areas, including the globus pallidus (GP) and white matter tracts such as the corpus callosum (CC).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The previously noted failure of RGS4 to impair signaling through the GnRH receptor despite significant GAP activity toward Gqα in vitro prompted us to examine whether RGS4 localized to the cell membrane similar to RGS-GAIP, RGS9, and Sst2p using a combination of cell fractionation, indirect immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopy. To determine the relative proportion of RGS4 in the cytoplasm versus cell membranes in NG108-15 cells, we immunoblotted 110 of the supernatant fraction (cytoplasm, Fig. 4 A, third lane) and all of the pellet fraction (membranes, Fig. 4 A, fourth lane) following hypotonic lysis in the absence of detergent and high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g). A similar intensity RGS4 band in the two preparations suggests that the cytoplasm contains approximately 10-fold more RGS4 than do the cell membranes. Reprobing the immunoblot with an antibody against syntaxin, which is almost exclusively membrane-associated (21Inoue A. Obata K. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10613-10619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), verified the integrity of the fractions (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). Immunofluorescent staining of endogenous RGS4 using the N-terminal RGS4 antiserum and NG108-15 cells revealed a diffuse pattern of expression in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region, whereas only background staining was seen with a preimmune serum (Fig. 4 B). Next, we performed immunoelectron microscopy to localize RGS4 ultrastructurally. NG108-15 cells were reacted with the N-terminal antipeptide antiserum; thin sections were prepared and evaluated by electron microscopy. RGS4 appears to be distributed diffusely in the cytosol as well as at the plasma membrane (Fig. 5). In contrast, only background staining was observed with a preimmune antiserum. These results, along with the immunofluorescent staining and immunoblotting of cellular fractions, indicate that RGS4 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm as a soluble protein.Figure 5Immunoelectron microscopy of RGS4 in NG108-15 cells. NG108-15 cells were stained with the anti-RGS4 antiserum (A) or preimmune control serum (B) on ThermanoxTM coverslips followed by an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Fab. Reaction product was visualized by adding enhanced DAB reagent and processing as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RGS4 localizes diffusely throughout the cytoplasm as well as at the membrane.

We reasoned, therefore, that the overexpression of an activated, GTPase-deficient Gα subunit (Giα2Q207L), might result in a translocation that would be more easily detectable. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of HA-tagged RGS4 in HEK293 cells detected by confocal microscopy demonstrated that like endogenous RGS4, most of the transfected protein is cytoplasmic (Fig. 6, far left column). Co-expression of the GTPase-deficient Giα2mutant, however, resulted in a dramatic shift of RGS4 out of the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6, second column from left). To determine whether the membrane recruitment of RGS4 was the direct result of physical association with an activated G-protein, we repeated the experiment in HEK293 cells transfected with an RGS4 mutant that does not bind Giα, RGS4(L159F) (22Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12851-12856Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), with or without the G-protein mutant. Surprisingly, we saw the same membrane shift of the nonbinding RGS4 mutant (Fig. 6, two right-hand columns). To confirm this observation, we transfected these cells with an HA-RGS4 plasmid alone or with Giα2(Q207L) and fractionated the cells as previously. 120 of the cytosol fractions and ½ of the membrane fraction were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 7, expression of the Giα mutant resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of both wild type RGS4 (top panel) and RGS4(L159F) (third panel from top) seen in the cytoplasm compared with the membrane fraction, consistent with the immunofluorescence. By densitometric analysis, the cytosol/membrane ratio of the wild type RGS4 protein was decreased from 96 to 3.8 in those cells expressing activated Gα. Likewise, the ratio of RGS4(L159F) went from 0.44 to 0.16. Of note, there appeared to be more pellet-associated RGS4(L159F) than was the case with wild type RGS4. However, the indirect immunofluorescence clearly shows that the majority of RGS4(L159F) is cytoplasmic. We hypothesize that some of the pelleted material may represent insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates that precipitated with high speed centrifugation rather than true membrane-associated protein. Nonetheless, the shift of RGS4(L159F) is still apparent from the cytosol/membrane ratio in the presence of activated Giα. Reprobing the blot with an antibody against 14-3-3 proteins confirmed that the overall ratio of protein in the two fractions remained constant (second panel from top). The expression of Giα2(Q207L) is shown in thebottom panel.Figure 7Translocation of wild type RGS4 and a nonfunctional mutant to the plasma membrane by overexpression of Giα2(Q207L). The top panel is an HA immunoblot of fractionated 293T cells (120 of the cytosol and ½ of the membrane fraction) transfected with HA-RGS4 with or without Giα2(Q207L). C, cytosol; M, membrane. The second panel is the same blot reprobed with an antiserum against 14-3-3 proteins. The third panel is an HA blot of transfected HA-RGS4(L159F) ± Giα2(Q207L) fractionated as above and in the same proportions. The bottom panel is the same blot reprobed with an anti-Giα1–2antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this study, we show that by adding recombinant RGS4 to GDP-AlF4−-treated cellular lysates, we could efficiently retrieve endogenous Giα and Gqα proteins, but neither Gsα nor G12α, which is consistent with its activity toward these Gα subfamilies in GAP assays. However, our main observation is that in unexpected contrast to RGS-GAIP and RGS9, other RGS proteins that have similar GAP activity as RGS4 and that localize predominantly at the plasma membrane, most of the cellular RGS4 is apparently soluble in the cytoplasm. However, it can be recruited to membranes by expression of an activated Gα subunit. This finding has several implications for the activity of RGS4 that make it unique among RGS proteins characterized so far. First, because a relatively small proportion of cellular RGS4 is membrane-associated at any given time, the trafficking of RGS4 to the plasma membrane could be an important regulatory mechanism capable of modulating both the intensity and duration of a signal generated through Gi- and Gq-coupled receptors. We used several different methods including cellular fractionation and immunoblotting, immunofluorescent staining with confocal microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy to visualize the relatively low levels of RGS4 at the plasma membrane despite the high total cellular levels of RGS4. Consistent with our findings, the addition of exogenous RGS4 to NG108-15 membranes raised the basal level of adenylyl cyclase activity and reversed enkephalin-mediated inhibition of cAMP synthesis triggered by prostaglandin E1 (11Hepler J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Because RGS family members act catalytically,i.e. a relatively small amount of RGS4 should be able to enhance GTP hydrolysis by an excess of Giα subunits, the endogenous levels of RGS4 present in the NG108-15 membrane preparation must be quite low. We speculate that RGS family members may be either membrane-associated such as RGS-GAIP, Sst2p, and RGS9, where they likely set a threshold for signaling, or largely soluble in the cytoplasm such as RGS4, from where they may be recruited to the membrane, possibly by the G-protein-linked signal itself. Indeed, if the entire NG108-15 cellular content of RGS4 was localized at the plasma membrane, signaling through Gi- and Gq-linked receptors would be predicted to be severely compromised. Consistent with the differential intracellular localization of various RGS family members is the recent identification of a novel RGS protein, RET-RGS1, which is likely localized to the plasma membrane by a transmembrane segment to enhance the GTPase activity of retinal transducin (23Faurobert E. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Second, because an RGS4 mutant protein that does not interact with activated Giα is nonetheless able to translocate to the membrane when a GTPase-deficient Giα is overexpressed, these results suggest that the recruitment of RGS4 is not a simple result of the physical RGS-Gα interaction. Indeed, our experiments demonstrate that transiently overexpressed Giα2(Q207L) is expressed to a large extent in the cytoplasmic fraction, and as previously stated, some studies have shown that RGS4 does not interact with nor act as a GAP toward Giα2(Q207L) (7Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 8Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear whether the G-protein recruits RGS4 directly. The physiologic effect of RGS4 overexpression is to impair signaling through Gi- and Gq-linked transmembrane receptors. Thus, it is likely that some other mechanism exists to target low levels of RGS4 to the plasma membrane. RGS4 does not have a transmembrane segment, but it does contain several N-terminal cysteines that undergo palmitoylation (24Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). 3K. Druey, unpublished results. Although this modification may assist in retaining RGS4 at the membrane, it does not explain how RGS4 initially localizes at the plasma membrane. Gβγ subunits have been implicated in targeting other proteins to the cell membrane; however, studies have indicated that RGS4 does not bind Gβγ subunits (9Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 38: 172-175Crossref Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RGS4 lacks SH2, SH3, or pleckstrin homology domains, which might mediate interactions with other proteins or phospholipids, so it remains unclear how RGS4 is co-localized with activated Gα subunits at the plasma membrane. Third, the cytoplasmic location of RGS4 could also serve as a reservoir for the recruitment of RGS proteins to other intracellular membranes where heterotrimeric G-proteins likely have regulatory roles such as in the exocytic secretory pathway. In LLC-PK1 epithelial cells Giα3 was found predominantly on Golgi membranes and diffusely throughout the cytoplasm (25Stow J.L. deAlmeida J.B. Narula N. Holtzman E.J. Ercolani L. Ausiello D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Giα3 retarded secretion of heparan sulfate proteoglycan and resulted in the accumulation of precursors in the medial-trans-Golgi. Deactivation of Giα3 by an RGS in this case would be expected to have the opposite effect, that is, to enhance secretion. Because RGS proteins increase GTPase activity of Giα and Gqα, they may provide valuable tools for the investigation of the role of these Gαsubunits in secretory pathways. Although one mechanism of RGS regulation may be differential localization within the cell, another is differential tissue expression. Some RGS family members such as RGS-GAIP and RGS3 are expressed in many tissues, whereas others such as RGS1 and RGS4 have a limited tissue distribution (3DeVries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis had identified neural tissue as a major site of RGS4 expression. The discovery of RGS4 (and presumably other RGS proteins expressed in brain) offers a novel mechanism by which neurons may sort the signals received from converging G-protein-linked pathways. We found high levels of RGS4 transcripts only in select areas of the brain, such as the nucleus of the diagonal band, a region enriched for cholinergic neurons (26Villaro M.T. Palacios J.M. Mengod G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 21: 30-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similarly, RGS1, which is expressed in B lymphocytes, is confined largely to a subset of the B-cell compartment, the germinal center region of lymphoid tissue. 4V. H. Kang and A. Scheschonka, unpublished data. That an RGS protein has such a small window of expression within a given tissue suggests that it likely helps regulate very specific responses; the examination of those cell types may provide a clue to its physiological role. Furthermore, if neurons express RGS4 predominantly in the cytoplasm as do NG108-15 cells, an understanding of the intracellular regulation of RGS4 may provide some interesting insights into signal integration in those neurons. As more is learned about the cellular localization, tissue distribution, mechanisms of activation, and G-protein specificity of the various RGS family members, a better understanding of the physiologic roles of this interesting group of proteins should emerge.

The latter is a product of the LIS1 gene, which is defective in the Miller-Dieker syndrome, a form of lissencephaly. In this study, we examined the expression patterns of these three subunits in the developing rat brain. All three subunits were expressed in embryonic brain, whereas only α2 and β subunit were detected in the adult brain by Western blotting. Biochemical analyses revealed that the α1/α2 heterodimer and α2/α2 homodimer are major catalytic units of embryonic and adult brain PAF acetylhydrolases, respectively. The α1 transcript and protein were detected predominantly in embryonic and postnatal neural tissues, such as the brain and spinal cord. Furthermore, we found using primary cultured cells isolated from neonatal rat brain that α1 protein were expressed only in neurons but not in glial cells and fibroblasts. In contrast, α2 and β transcripts and proteins were detected both in neural and non-neural tissues, and their expression level was almost constant from fetal stages through adulthood. These results indicate that α1 expression is restricted to actively migrating neurons in rats and that switching of catalytic subunits from the α1/α2 heterodimer to the α2/α2 homodimer occurred in these cells during brain development, suggesting that PAF acetylhydrolase plays a role(s) in neuronal migration.

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) 1The abbreviations used are: PAF, platelet-activating factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. is a potent pro-inflammatory phospholipid produced by leukocytes, platelets, endothelial cells, and some neural cells. Mammalian brains contain significant amounts of PAF, which may act as a synapse messenger and transcription inducer of the early-response genes c-fos and c-jun (1Bazan N.G. Rodriguez D.T. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 26: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PAF has also been implicated as a messenger in long term potentiation, a cellular model of memory formation (2Kato K. Clark G.D. Bazan N.G. Zorumski C.F. Nature. 1994; 367: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). PAF is inactivated by a specific enzyme, PAF acetylhydrolase, which removes the acetyl moiety at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone (3Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mammalian PAF acetylhydrolase is classified into two types (4Yanoshita R. Kudo I. Ikizawa K. Chang H.W. Kobayashi S. Ohno M. Nojima S. Inoue K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1988; 103: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), plasma (extracellular) and tissue (intracellular). The former is a 43-kDa monomeric enzyme that effectively abolishes the inflammatory effects of PAF on leukocytes and the vasculature, indicating it is involved in maintaining plasma PAF at certain levels (5Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le T.H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W.

(i) The amino acid sequences of the three subunits showed extremely high homologies among the above mammalian species. For example, the amino acid sequences of the β subunit from the mouse, rat, and cow were identical and only one amino acid substitution was observed in the human β subunit. Similarly, only one amino acid substitution was observed in the human α2 subunit in comparison with those from the other three species. The sequence identities of the α1 subunits are lower than those of the α2 and β subunits, but are still over 95% among these four species. (ii) The α1 (29 kDa) and α2 (30 kDa) subunits show about 60% amino acid homology with each other, and both α1 and α2 have a catalytic center (9Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31345-31352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). (iii) When these catalytic subunits were expressed individually in Escherichia coli, they formed catalytically competent homodimers (10Hattori M. Adachi H. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31345-31352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), although the α1 and α2 subunits of the PAF acetylhydrolase(Ib) purified from bovine brain formed a heterodimer. (iv) The β subunit, which does not possess enzymatic activity, has a unique domain structure, called WD40, which may interact with other proteins. Indeed, the β subunit was shown to interact with spectrin through a pleckstrin homology domain in vitro (16Wang D.S. Shaw R. Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. Shaw G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). (v) The β subunit gene is identical to the human LIS1 gene, the causative gene of the Miller-Dieker syndrome (11Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Nature. 1994; 370: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We have also succeeded in crystallizing the recombinant α1/α1 homodimer at 1.7-Å resolution (17Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the catalytic subunits of PAF acetylhydrolase (Ib) are very similar to those found in p21ras and other GTPases, such as the α subunit of trimeric G-protein. This and the fact that the PAF acetylhydrolase (Ib) β subunit shows limited but significant sequence homology with the G protein β subunit indicate that PAF acetylhydrolase(Ib) is essentially a trimeric G-protein-like (α1/α2)β molecule. 2Originally, we named the three subunits of PAF acetylhydrolase, α1 (29 kDa), α2 (30 kDa), and β (45 kDa), γ, β, and α subunits, respectively. In view of their structural similarities to trimeric G-proteins, we have changed their nomenclature to the form in this paper. Miller-Dieker syndrome is manifested by widespread agyria of the brain and is thought to be due to a defect in the neuronal migration process during brain development. Although the physiological function of PAF acetylhydrolase is not fully understood, it has been speculated to play an important role in neuronal cell migration in the developing brain. Previous studies demonstrated that mRNAs of all three subunits were expressed predominantly in premigrating or migrating neurons in the fetal brains and developing cerebella of mice (14Albrecht U. Abu-Issa R. Ratz B. Hattori M. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Eichele G. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Reiner O. Albrecht U. Gordon M. Chianese K.A. Wong C. Gal G.O. Sapir T. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M. Caskey C.T. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3730-3738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a link between neuronal migration and brain PAF acetylhydrolase. It is also interesting to note that NudF, a nuclear migration gene in Aspergillus nidulans, shows 42% sequence identity to the human LIS1 gene, suggesting that the LIS1 gene product (the PAF acetylhydrolase β subunit) has a function similar to that of NudF and that nuclear migration plays a role in neuronal cell migration. As part of our continuing studies on the physiological role of PAF acetylhydrolase, we have examined the developmental expression patterns of the three PAF acetylhydrolase subunits in rats. In this study we demonstrated that the expression of one catalytic subunit (α1) is regulated developmentally and that changes in α1 expression resulted in the switching of brain PAF acetylhydrolase catalytic subunits during brain development. Polyclonal antibodies against the α1 and α2 subunits were prepared as follows. Rabbits (New Zealand White) were immunized with 200 μg of purified recombinant bovine protein (10Hattori M. Adachi H. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31345-31352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by four boosters at 2-week intervals with 100 μg of protein, sera were prepared and used as antisera against the α1 (antisera 453) and α2 (antisera 444) subunits. These antisera were affinity-purified using rat α1- and rat α2-coupled Sepharose 4B columns. Anti-β monoclonal antibody (clone 338.40) was a kindly gift from Dr. O. Reiner (28Sapir T. Elbaum M. Reiner O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6977-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Tissues and samples of brain at various developmental stages from Wistar rats were homogenized with four times their volumes (w/v) of SET buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose), as described (6Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used as the cytosol fractions, the protein concentrations of which were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). An aliquot (50 μg) of each cytosol fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters using the Bio-Rad protein transfer system. The filters were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) skim milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, incubated with the required antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20, and then treated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Proteins bound to the antibodies were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Homogenates of various tissues and embryos were prepared as described above, and their PAF acetylhydrolase activities were measured, as described previously (6Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using [3H]acetyl-PAF as the substrate. DEAE column chromatography was performed as described elsewhere (6Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydroxyapatite (ECONOPACK CHT-II, Bio-Rad) and Mono Q FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were linked to an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For hydroxyapatite column chromatography, the active fraction from the DEAE column was rechromatographed, and the proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–200 mm potassium phosphate. For Mono Q FPLC column chromatography, the active fraction from the hydroxyapatite column was rechromatographed, and the proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl. For isotopic detection of rat PAF acetylhydrolase α1, α2, and β mRNAs, two or three nonoverlapping antisense 45-mer oligonucleotide probes complementary to nucleotide residues 304–348, 644–688, and 781–825 of α1 cDNA, 112–156 and 730–774 of α2 cDNA, and 268–313 and 1577–1621 of β cDNA were synthesized (15Watanabe M. Aoki J. Manya H. Arai H. Keizo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1409: 73-79Google Scholar). Each probe was labeled with35S-dATP using terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) to produce a specific activity of 0.5 × 109 dpm/μg DNA. The rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and whole embryos were removed on embryonic days (E) 13, 15, and 18 and brains on postnatal days (P) 1, 7, 14, and 21 and from adults (4 months old). The tissue specimens were frozen immediately in powdered dry ice, fresh frozen sections 20 mm thick were prepared using a cryostat and treated at room temperature as follows: fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, acetylation with 0.25% (w/v) acetic anhydride in 0.1 mtriethanolamine HCl, pH 8.0, for 10 min, and prehybridization for 1 h in a buffer comprising 50% (v/v) formamide, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.02% (v/v) Ficoll, 0.02% (v/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 600 mm NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) SDS, 200 μg/ml tRNA, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate. Then, hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 10 h in the prehybridization buffer supplemented with 10,000 cpm/ml35S-labeled oligonucleotide probes and 100 mmdithiothreitol. The slides were washed twice at 55 °C for 40 min with 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% (w/v) Sarkosyl and autoradiographed using either Hyperfilm-β max (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 days or nuclear track emulsion (Kodak NTB-2, Eastman Kodak Co.) for 2 months. Cross-linking was performed as described previously (10Hattori M. Adachi H. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31345-31352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, each sample was dialyzed against 100 mm sodium phosphate, cross-linked by adding 10 mm BS3 (Pierce) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Expression of each PAF acetylhydrolase subunit in fetal (21-day-old embryo, E21) and adult (9 weeks old) rat brains was examined by Western blotting with affinity-purified anti-α1 and -α2 polyclonal antibodies and an anti-β monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, all three subunits were detected in fetal brains. As the intensities of the α1 and α2 subunits subjected to Western blotting were very similar (data not shown), it would appear that almost equal amounts of α1 and α2 proteins were expressed in the fetal rat brain. In contrast, only α2 and β subunits were detected in adult rat brains. In fact, the α1 subunit was not detected in any of the adult rat tissue tested (Fig. 1 B). These data indicate that the PAF acetylhydrolase complex exists in a form other than the classical α1/α2/β heterotrimer in adult rat tissues, including the brain. As both the α1 and α2 recombinant proteins expressed individually inE. coli formed their respective homodimers (10Hattori M. Adachi H. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31345-31352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is likely that the α2 protein present in adult rat brain and other tissues also exists as a homodimer. To investigate this, we analyzed the subunit composition of PAF acetylhydrolase in adult (9 weeks) and embryonic (E21) rat brains. PAF acetylhydrolase from fetal and adult brain cytosols were partially purified by sequential DEAE ion-exchange followed by hydroxyapatite column chromatography. Two peaks showing PAF acetylhydrolase activity were obtained from the adult rat brain after hydroxyapatite column chromatography (Fig. 2 B), and each fraction was subjected to PAF acetylhydrolase assay and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the first peak showing PAF acetylhydrolase activity, which was eluted by about 80 mm phosphate, contained only α2 polypeptides, whereas the second, which was eluted by 150 mm phosphate, contained α2 and β polypeptides. To examine complex formation in each fraction, a cross-linking experiment using the cross-linking reagent BS3 was performed. Mixing the first peak fraction with 10 mmBS3 resulted in conversion of the 30-kDa α2 polypeptide to a ∼60-kDa band, detected using SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, lane 6), suggesting that the α2 polypeptide present in the first peak fraction had formed a homodimer. Cross-linking of the second peak fraction unexpectedly yielded a faint but significant ∼200-kDa band in addition to the ∼60-kDa band (Fig. 3, lane 8). We could not ascertain whether the ∼200-kDa band contained the β polypeptide, because the monoclonal antibody against β polypeptide loses its reactivity after chemical modification with BS3.Figure 3Cross-linking of α2 protein in embryonic and adult rat brain PAF acetylhydrolase. The α2 proteins in the first (lanes 1 and 2) and the second (lanes 3 and 4) peaks showing PAF acetylhydrolase activity after hydroxyapatite column chromatography (Fig. 2) were cross-linked using BS3 and detected by Western blotting, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results before (lanes 1–4) and after (lanes 4–7) cross-linking are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PAF acetylhydrolase activity in the fetal brain was also separated into two peaks by hydroxyapatite column chromatography (Fig. 2 A). The first peak contained α1 and α2 polypeptides and second contained α1, α2, and β polypeptides. Incubation of the first peak fraction with BS3 also yielded a ∼60-kDa band, which cross-reacted with both the anti-α1 and anti-α2 antibodies, indicating that it represented a α1/α2 heterodimer complex. This fraction may have contained a mixture of α1/α1 and α2/α2 homodimers, but this possibility can be ruled out by the observation that the activity eluted in a single peak at a position different from that of the α2/α2 homodimer by mono Q FPLC chromatography (Fig. 4). Incubation of the second peak fraction with BS3 also produced a ∼200-kDa band, in addition to the 60-kDa band (Fig. 3, lane 7). To elucidate the developmental changes in the expression of the PAF acetylhydrolase subunit mRNAs, parasagittal sections of rat whole embryos and postnatal brains were examined byin situ hybridization with subunit-specific antisense oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 5). During the embryonic stages, high levels of all three subunit mRNAs were expressed in the brain, spinal cord, sensory ganglia (dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia), and thymus (Fig. 5, A–C,I–K, Q–S). The signals in the brain were distributed throughout the ventricular and marginal zones. Expression of α1 subunit mRNA was observed mainly in neural tissues, whereas other non-neural embryonic tissues expressed low to moderate levels of α2 and β subunit mRNAs. The hepatic levels of β subunit mRNA were particularly high in comparison with those of other non-neural tissues. α2 subunit mRNA was expressed ubiquitously in rat embryos (Fig. 5, I–K). At birth (P0), expression of all three subunit mRNAs in the brain was marked (Fig. 5, D,L, T). Thereafter, the levels of α1 subunit mRNA declined gradually and reached the background level by the adult stage (Fig. 5, E–H). High α2 and β subunit mRNA expression levels were ubiquitous in the gray matter of the brain until the adult stage (Fig. 5, M–P,U–X). Western blot analysis on the expression of PAF acetylhydrolase subunit expression during brain development was also carried out. The embryonic brain expressed high levels of all three polypeptides (Fig. 6 A). High α1 subunit expression levels in the cerebrum and cerebellum were maintained until P4 and P7, respectively, and then declined gradually to adult levels (P63) (Fig. 6, B and C). In contrast, the α2 and β subunit expression did not change dramatically, although α2 subunit expression increased slightly as that of α1 started to decline. To identify the cell type(s) that expressed each subunit, we isolated neural cells from neonatal rat cerebellum, then performed Western blotting analysis on these cells in the primary cultures. As shown in Fig. 7, the α1 subunit was expressed exclusively in granule cells, whereas the α2 and β subunits were expressed in granule cells, astroglial cells, and oligodendrocytes. Granule cells are known to migrate actively from the external to the internal granular layer in the cerebella of postnatal rats. This study is, the first to demonstrate the existance of the α2/α2 homodimer, as well as the α1/α2 heterodimer, in vivo. In rats, switching of the catalytic complex from the α1/α2 heterodimer to the α2/α2 homodimer occurs in the brain during development. The α1 subunit (or α1/α2 heterodimer) appears to be expressed specifically in neurons of fetal and neonatal brains. Furthermore, high α1 subunit expression levels were observed between E16 and E21 and between E19 and P7 in the cerebrum and cerebellum, respectively. Neuronal migration is well known to be particularly active during these periods in rats, suggesting a link between brain PAF acetylhydrolase and neuronal migration. Significant levels of the α1 subunit were not expressed in any of the adult rat tissues, including the brain, tested. This was also the case in the mouse (data not shown). In our previous study, however, we demonstrated that PAF acetylhydrolase purified from the brains of young-adult cows (1 to 2 years old) comprised α1, α2, and β subunits, and this complex was also detected in the bovine kidney (6Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Northern blot analysis of various human tissues revealed that significant levels of the α1 subunit were expressed in the kidney, thymus, and colon of the adult human, although the highest α1 subunit expression level was observed in the fetal human brain (12Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the α1 subunit expression pattern seems to differ among mammalian species. Cell migration remains prominent in the adult organism under normal physiological, as well as pathological, conditions. During the inflammatory response, for example, leukocytes migrate into areas subjected to insult, and migration of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells is essential for wound healing. It is, therefore, possible that cells expressing the α1 subunit possess the ability to migrate in adult tissues. Alternatively, PAF acetylhydrolase possessing α1, α2, and β subunits may play roles in processes other than cell migration. It is essential to determine the cell type(s) expressing the α1 subunit in adult bovine and human tissues to elucidate the physiological function(s) of intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase. In contrast to the α1 subunit, expression of the α2 and β subunits was found to be fairly universal in all species tested (13Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 10-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Watanabe M. Aoki J. Manya H. Arai H. Keizo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1409: 73-79Google Scholar). Therefore, the α2/α2 and α2/α2/β complexes may have more generalized functions than cell migration. What is the functional difference between the α1/α2 heterodimer and α2/α2 homodimer? The α1 and α2 catalytic subunits show approximately 60% amino acid homology and then can form their respective homodimers and the heterodimer. According to the crystal structure of the α1/α1 homodimer (17Ho Y.S. Swenson L. Derewenda L.S. Wei Y. Dauter Z. Hattori M. Adachi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Derewenda Z.S. Nature. 1997; 385: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), most of the amino acids that are not conserved in α2 subunits are located on the surface of the complex and are not utilized for dimer formation or catalysis. This suggests that the surface natures of the α1/α2 heterodimer and α2/α2 homodimer complexes are distinctly different. In fact, theKm and V max values of each catalytic complex are roughly the same (9Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23150-23155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hattori M. Adachi H. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31345-31352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). According to our preliminary experiments, all three catalytic complexes (α1/α1, α1/α2, and α2/α2) interact with the β subunit, but their affinities for it differ. Moreover, the catalytic activity of each complex is affected in a different manner upon binding to the β subunit. For example, the catalytic activity of the α1/α1 and α1/α2 complexes is suppressed, whereas that of the α2/α2 complex is stimulated, upon binding to the β subunit. 3H. Manya, J. Aoki, H. Arai, and K. Inoue, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, regulation of catalytic activity toward PAF by the β subunit may be crucial to cells during migration. It is also possible that, in addition to the β subunit, a different complex interacts with a different protein, although we have no data to support this idea. An unexpected finding was that cross-linking of the fractions containing the α1, α2, and β subunits and α2 and β subunits yielded products of approximately 200 kDa, demonstrated by SDS-PAGE. Gel filtration column chromatography showed that the complex purified from bovine brain had a molecular mass of about 100 kDa, and SDS-PAGE revealed it was composed of three subunits (10Hattori M. Adachi H. Aoki J. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31345-31352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that purified PAF acetylhydrolase is a heterotrimer complex. However, it is possible that PAF acetylhydrolase present in vivo is associated with other protein(s) in a reversible manner and that this protein(s) dissociated from the complex during the purification procedures. Indeed, the β subunit can be dissociated from the complex by heparin column chromatography (11Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Nature. 1994; 370: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and can be re-associated with a catalytic complex.3 Morris and his group (19Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Xiang X. Beckwith S.M. Morris N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1995; 6: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) isolated a set of mutants defective in nuclear migration and distribution in the multinuclear filamentous fungus A. nidulans and cloned several genes (nudgenes) required for nuclear migration using these mutants. Interestingly, nudF encodes a protein with 42% sequence identity to the human LIS1 gene product (i.e. the PAF acetylhydrolase β subunit) (21Xiang X. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. Xin M. Morris N.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Cytological observations suggested that nuclear translocation is an essential feature of neuronal migration both in the cerebral cortex (22Book K.J. Morest D.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 297: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the cerebellum (23Rakic P. J. Comp. Neurol. 1971; 141: 283-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). If nuclear migration is essential for neuronal migration, it is reasonable to conclude that a defect in nuclear translocation is the cause of the neuronal migration defect observed in Miller-Dieker lissencephaly. An other gene, nudC, encodes a 22-kDa protein of unknown function, but it shows 68% identity to the C-terminal half of C15 protein, which was originally identified as a prolactin-inducible gene in activated T cells (24Axtell S.M. Truong T.M. O'Neal K.D. Yu L.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 312-318PubMed Google Scholar). Complementation experiments showed that the full-length mammalian (rat) C15 protein, which has a molecular mass of 45 kDa, is capable of rescuing the nuclear movement defect of nudC mutants (25Morris S.M. Anaya P. Xiang X. Morris N.R. May G.S. Yu L.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating that rat C15 protein and fungal nudC protein not only have similar structures, but also serve similar functions. Studies onA. nidulans mutants have shown that the nudCprotein regulates the nudF protein post-transcriptionally, suggesting that nudF and nudC proteins interact within cells. In addition to nudF and nudC, two other genes have been identified, nudA and nudG, which encode a cytoplasmic dynein heavy and light chain, respectively (19Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Xiang X. Beckwith S.M. Morris N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), indicating that cytoplasmic dynein is involved in nuclear migration. Microtubules have been shown to be required for nuclear migration in a wide variety of organisms. Cytoplasmic dynein, a microtubule-dependent, minus end-directed motor (26Gibbons I.R. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), apparently provides the motive force for nuclear migration. Genetic studies have located nudF (and also nudC) upstream of dynein (27Willins D.A. Liu B. Xiang X. Morris N.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, the nudF gene product, which may be a homolog of the LIS1 gene product, and the PAF acetylhydrolase β subunit may interact with multiple proteins involved in nuclear migration. In fact, Sapir et al. (28Sapir T. Elbaum M. Reiner O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6977-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that the β subunit interacts directly with tubulin and regulates microtubular dynamics. A complex of >200 kDa may contain such components in addition to the PAF acetylhydrolase subunits. Identification of a protein(s) that interacts with (the subunits of) PAF acetylhydrolase will be essential to elucidate the physiological function of the enzyme."

Cell cycle checkpoints are regulatory pathways ensuring that the events of the cell cycle are completed with high fidelity and in an orderly fashion (reviewed in Refs. 1Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A.

When cells are subjected to conditions that interfere with DNA replication or cause damage to DNA, a signal is sent to halt cell cycle progression, thus permitting cell cycle phase completion or DNA repair (1Hartwell L.H.

Currently, little is known about the biochemistry of checkpoint control; however, the identification and characterization of human homologues of yeast checkpoint genes provides clear evidence that checkpoint pathways are conserved between mammals and yeast.

DNA sequencing was carried out on double-stranded plasmid DNA with dye-terminator chemistry as prescribed by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems), and the products were resolved on an ABI PrismTM 377 Automated Sequencer. The complete DNA sequences of relevant inserts were aligned as described. The 5′ end of the longest cDNA was extended by 5′ RACE-PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Two gene-specific primers were designed to the 5′ end of the putativeHrad17 ORF: GSP1(5′-TTCTATGACTTGAGTTATTCACACC-3′) and GSP2 (5′-GGCAGTAATAGTAGAGACGCCAC-3′). These were used in a nested PCR reaction with Marathon-Ready human placental cDNA (CLONTECH) as the template. The first PCR reaction made use of the GSP1 PCR primer for the 3′ end, combined with the AP1 primer from CLONTECH that is complementary to an adaptor ligated to the 5′ end of all Marathon-Ready cDNAs. The second PCR reaction started from 1–5 μl of the first and used the GSP2 in combination with a nested AP2 primer (CLONTECH). The reaction conditions for the first RACE-PCR were 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The subsequent nested PCR consisted of two-step cycles, each containing a 30-s denaturation step at 95 °C and a combined annealing and elongation step for 2 min, which was carried out at 72 °C for the first five cycles, at 70 °C for the five subsequent cycles, and at 68 °C for the remaining 25 cycles. The reaction products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and specific reaction products were excised from the gel, purified using the QIAQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and ligated into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The insert sequence of eight independent clones was determined and compared with the putativeHrad17 partial cDNA sequence. The 5′ RACE clones extended the partial Hrad17 sequence to a putative initiation codon as determined by alignment with the S. pombe rad17 sequence. PCR primers were designed to amplify the complete Hrad17 ORF (OAP094, 5′-GCCGAATTCATGAATCAGGTAACAGACTGGGTT-3′, and OP076, 5′-GGCGGATCCTCGAGTCTGTCCCATCACTCTCGTAGT-3′) to enable subcloning into various expression vectors. The complete ORF was PCR-amplified from cDNA prepared from human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells using the following PCR reaction conditions: 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 64 °C, and 2 min at 75 °C. The amplification products were directly cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the DNA sequence from three independent clones ofHrad17 was determined. Two multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) and a cancer cell line Northern blot (CLONTECH) were hybridized with a DNA probe corresponding to the complete Hrad17 ORF labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random hexamer priming using the Prime-a-Gene Kit (Promega). The blots were washed at high stringency (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 50 °C, 2 × 20 min) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat autoradiography film with intensifying screens at −70° C. The blots were then rehybridized with a human β-actin probe (CLONTECH) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as described above. The films were scanned, and quantification of the bands was performed with the program Image Master 1D (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). S. pombe was cultured by standard techniques (21Leupold U. Methods Cell Physiol. 1970; 4: 169-177Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The genotypes of the strains used are as follows: APY002, h+ leu1-32 ura4-D18 ade6-M216, and GBY192, h+ rad17::ura4+, leu1-32, ura4-D18, ade6-M216. The complete ORF coding forHrad17 was cloned into the SmaI site of theS. pombe expression vector pREP3X (22Maundrell K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) using standard techniques. Transformation of S. pombe was carried out by electroporation (23Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complete Hrad17 ORF was biotinylated with dATP using the Life Technologies, Inc. BioNick labeling kit (24Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). FISH mapping was carried out by SeeDNA Inc. (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) (25Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 26Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 33: 35-49PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously for Hrad1 (50). The MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System 2 (CLONTECH) was used to examine protein-protein interactions. The complete Hrad1A, Hrad1B,Hrad9, and Hrad17 ORFs were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pAS2-1 DNA-binding domain vector (CLONTECH) and the pACT2 activation domain vector (CLONTECH) using the following primers:Hrad1A for pAS2-1: OML004 (5′-GCCGAATTCATGCCCCTTCTGACCCAACAGA-3′) and OML002 (5′-CTGCCTAGGTCAAGACTCAGATTCAGGAACTTC-3′); Hrad1A for pACT2: OML003 (5′-AAGGATCCGAATGCCCCTTCTGACCCAACAGA-3′) and OML001 (5′-TAGCTCGAGTCAAGACTCAGATTCAGGAACTTC-3′);Hrad1B for pAS2-1: OAP101 (5′-GCCGAATTCATGTGTTACCAAGGT-3′) and OML002; Hrad1B for pACT2: OAP102 (5′-GGGGATCCGAATGTGTTACCAAGGT-3′) and OML001;Hrad9 for pAS2-1: OAP079 (5′-ACTCATATGAAGTGCCTGGTCACG-3′) and OAP080 (5′-CTGCCTAGGTCAGCCTTCACCCTC-3′);Hrad17 for pAS2-1: OAP094 and OAP082 (5′-CTGCCTAGGCTATGTCCCATCACT-3′); and Hrad17 for pACT2: OAP095 (5′-GGGGATCCGAATGAATCAGGTAACAGACTGGGTT-3′) and OAP088 (5′-GAGCTCGAGCCTATGTCCCATCACT-3′). The DNA sequences of all inserts were verified. The S. cerevisiae reporter strain was Y187 (Mat-α ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112 gal4Δ, met-, gal80Δ, URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ). All plasmids were transformed individually and in all pair-wise combinations. Transformants were plated on synthetic defined medium lacking the appropriate amino acids (27Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Colony lifting and detection of β-galactosidase activity on filters and in liquid culture was carried out as prescribed by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). A human expressed sequence tag cDNA clone (number 515944) was identified in the proprietary LifeSeq® data base (Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc., Palo Alto, CA) using the TBLASTN homology searching program (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69652) Google Scholar) with the S. pombe rad17+ amino acid sequence as the query. This clone was purchased from Incyte Pharmaceuticals and DNA sequence analysis of the 1.9-kb insert revealed an incomplete ORF that was highly similar to the S. pombe Rad17 amino acid sequence. Further searches of the public data bases using the clone 515944-derived DNA sequence as the query sequence identified several expressed sequence tags with significant sequence similarity. One of these (accession numberAA287094) extended the putative Hrad17 sequence in a 5′ direction and maintained the similarity to S. pombe rad17. This sequence did not extend to the 5′ end of the ORF, and comparison of the derived amino acid sequence with theS. pombe rad17+ sequence suggested that approximately 60 nucleotides were missing. To complete the putativeHrad17 ORF, a 5′ RACE-PCR was carried out using a Marathon-Ready human placental cDNA library (CLONTECH) and two gene-specific primers. Approximately 350 nucleotides of novel 5′ DNA sequence were obtained, including 57 nucleotides required to complete the Hrad17 ORF and 300 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated region. Termination codons were present in all three reading frames in the 80 nucleotides immediately 5′ to the putative Hrad17 initiation codon, indicating that we had isolated the complete coding region (Fig. 1). The full-length Hrad17 ORF was then amplified from cDNA prepared from human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells, and the insert DNA sequence from three independent clones was determined. The complete coding region of Hrad17is 2010 nucleotides in length and has 49% identity to the S. pombe rad17+ sequence at the DNA level and 49% identity and 72% similarity at the amino acid level (Fig. 2). The Hrad17 sequence has been deposited into GenBankTM under accession numberAJ004977. Hrad17 also has significant sequence similarity to S. cerevisiae RAD24 (Fig. 2). The Hrad17 cDNA encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 71 kDa.Figure 2Amino acid sequence alignment between humanRad17, S. pombe Rad17, and S. cerevisiaeRAD24 obtained with the CLUSTALW alignment program.Identical residues are highlighted in black and conserved residues are highlighted in gray. The putative nucleotide-binding domain is underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The transcript profile ofHrad17 was examined by probing two multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) and a cancer cell line Northern blot (CLONTECH) with a probe corresponding to the complete Hrad17 ORF. A single transcript of approximately 3.0 kb was identified for Hrad17. The blots were also hybridized with a β-actin probe to demonstrate equal loading of RNA across all lanes. The Hrad17 transcript was present in all tissues examined and was highly elevated in testis. Although the β-actin signal is slightly elevated in the cancer cell lines when compared with the normal tissue blots, it is clear that the level ofHrad17 transcript is dramatically elevated in the cancer cell lines examined (Fig. 3). Because theHrad17 sequence that we have identified is over 2800 bp long, it is likely to include most of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region, considering that a typical mammalian poly(A) tail can be several hundred nucleotides long. The presence of an oligo(dT) stretch at the 3′ end of the clone supports the conclusion that we have the full 3′-untranslated region. Complementation has often been used to demonstrate biological activity for mammalian homologues of yeast proteins (9Lieberman H.B. Hopkins K.M. Nass M. Demetrick D. Davey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13890-13895Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28Lee M.G. Nurse P. Nature. 1987; 327: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). We examined whether Hrad17 could complement the UV irradiation (DNA damage-dependent checkpoint) and hydroxyurea (DNA replication-dependent checkpoint) sensitivity phenotypes of an S. pombe rad17::ura4+ strain. Hrad17 was cloned into the S. pombe expression vector pREP3x (22Maundrell K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) and transformed into wild type andrad17::ura4+ cells. Transformants were exposed to varying doses of UV or transiently exposed to 10 mm hydroxyurea as described previously (15Griffiths D.J.F. Barbet N.C. McCready S. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We observed no complementation of the UV or hydroxyurea sensitivity phenotypes (data not shown). The chromosomal position of Hrad17 was determined to establish whether loss of heterozygosity associated with Hrad17 might be linked with any known disease. The 2.6-kb cDNA corresponding to expressed sequence tag clone number AA287094 was used as a probe for FISH mapping. Under the conditions used, the hybridization efficiency was approximately 71% for the probe (among 100 checked mitotic figures, 71 showed signals on one pair of chromosomes). No additional locus was picked up by FISH detection under the conditions used. The 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) banding pattern was used to establish that Hrad17 localizes to the long arm of chromosome 4 (25Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The detailed position was further determined based upon the analysis of 10 photographs leading to the conclusion thatHrad17 is located on human chromosome 4q13.3-q21.2 (Fig. 4). Loss of heterozygosity of this region of chromosome 4 has been linked to a variety of human neoplasias including breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer (29Tirkkonen M. Johannsson O. Agnarsson B.A. Olsson H. Ingvarsson S. Karhu R. Tanner M. Isola J. Barkardottir R.B. Borg A. Kallioniemi O.-P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1222-1227PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nagai H. Pineau P.

The yeast two-hybrid system has been used extensively to examine protein-protein interactions (35Li B. Fields S. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 36Iwabuchi K.

Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2939-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). We cloned Hrad17, Hrad9, and two forms ofHrad1 generated by alternative splicing (49Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Oostveen I. Yon J. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H.M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18332-18339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), into the yeast two-hybrid expression vectors pAS2-1 and pACT (CLONTECH) and then transformed them individually or as pair-wise combinations into S. cerevisiae strain Y187 (CLONTECH). Transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity either on filter lifts or usingO-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate as described by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). The β-galactosidase activity was high in cells transformed with Hrad17 combined with either form of Hrad1, indicating a positive interaction (Fig. 5). In addition, Hrad17 was able to interact with itself to a lesser extent. Hrad9 did not show any interaction with itself nor with Hrad1 or Hrad17 (Fig. 5). The interaction between Hrad17 and Hrad1 was only observed when Hrad1 was fused with the GAL4 activation domain. We interpret this to mean that the 163-amino acid GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the N terminus of Hrad1 was hindering the interaction with Hrad17. We have identified a human cDNA encoding a protein that shares significant sequence similarity with the S. pombe Rad17 protein and the S. cerevisiae RAD24 protein. Alignment of these sequences identifies several blocks of sequence similarity that are conserved between the human and yeast proteins and the human replication factor C subunits (15Griffiths D.J.F. Barbet N.C. McCready S. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). One of these contains the consensus sequence for a nucleotide-binding domain. This domain is required for Rad17 function in S. pombe (15Griffiths D.J.F. Barbet N.C. McCready S. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The other regions of sequence similarity are not reminiscent of any defined functional domain but may reflect shared biological activity such as association with elements of the replication machinery or binding of specific DNA structures (15Griffiths D.J.F. Barbet N.C. McCready S. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5812-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The Hrad17 transcript is present in all tissues that we examined and increased in all the cancer cell lines examined, suggesting either that transcription of Hrad17 is proliferation-dependent or that it is increased in response to the genomic instability of cancer cell lines. The level ofHrad17 transcript in testis is approximately 10-fold that seen in other tissues. Several yeast cell cycle checkpoint genes play important roles in meiosis (38Kato R. Ogawa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3104-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and recently ATM and ATR (the human homologue of S. pombe Rad3) were shown to be highly expressed in testis where they interact with meiotic chromosomes. This suggests a direct role for these proteins in recognizing and responding to DNA strand interruptions that occur during meiotic recombination (39Keegan K.S. Holtzman D.A. Plug A.W. Christenson E.R. Brainerd E.E. Flaggs G. Bentley N.J. Taylor E.M. Meyn M.S. Moss S.B. Carr A.M. Ashley T. Hoekstra M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2423-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Hrad1 is also highly expressed in testis (49Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Oostveen I. Yon J. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H.M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18332-18339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that Hrad1 and Hrad17 may form part of a recognition complex in association with ATM or ATR. Loss of checkpoint function has been shown to lead to genomic instability even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage (40Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In man the p53 gene and the ATM gene are required for the G1-S phase checkpoint (41Yin Y. Tainsky M.A. Bischoff F.Z. Strong L.C. Wahl G.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 42Livingstone L.R. White A. Sprouse J. Livanos E. Jacks T. Tlsty T.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). These genes also act as tumor suppressors (43Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Diery W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is likely that other checkpoint genes will act as tumor suppressors. We have shown thatHrad17 resides on chromosome 4 position q13.3–21.2. Loss of heterozygosity of this region of chromosome 4 has been linked to a variety of human neoplasias including breast cancer (29Tirkkonen M. Johannsson O. Agnarsson B.A. Olsson H. Ingvarsson S. Karhu R. Tanner M. Isola J. Barkardottir R.B. Borg A. Kallioniemi O.-P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1222-1227PubMed Google Scholar), hepatocellular carcinoma (30Nagai H. Pineau P. Tiollais P. Buendia M.A. Dejean A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2927-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and small cell lung cancer (13Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H.

Cancer. 1997; 75: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Consequently, Hrad17 should be considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 4q. There is also evidence for the presence of an as yet unidentified gene on chromosome 4q that regulates DNA replication in response to DNA damage (33Verhaegh G.W. Jongmans W. Jaspers N.G. Natarajan A.T. Oshimura M. Lohman P.H. Zdzienicka M.Z. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1095-1103PubMed Google Scholar) and that is involved in the G1 arrest in cellular senescence (34Parkinson E.K. Newbold R.F. Keith W.N. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 5: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Hrad17 should also be considered as a potential candidate for these gene functions. Demonstration of an interaction between Hrad17 and Hrad1 provides further evidence that we have identified the human homologue ofS. pombe rad17. In fission yeast these two gene products act early in both the DNA damage-dependent and DNA replication-dependent checkpoint pathways, and mutants in either gene have similar phenotypes. In the budding yeast, RAD24 and RAD17 (the homologue of S. pombe rad1) are only required for the DNA damage-dependent checkpoint and have been shown to function in conjunction with MEC1 to activate DNA degradation (47Lydall D. Weinert T. Science. 1995; 270: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that there is a requirement to process single- or double-stranded breaks such that single-stranded DNA is exposed to activate the checkpoint (47Lydall D. Weinert T. Science. 1995; 270: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 48Carr A.M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two forms of Hrad1 have been identified; Hrad1A which has an exonuclease activity and Hrad1B, an inactive N-terminal truncation of Hrad1A (49Parker A.E. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Oostveen I. Yon J. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H.M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18332-18339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We show in our two-hybrid assay that Hrad17 interacts with both forms of Hrad1. We also find that Hrad17 is able to interact with itself suggesting the presence of a multi-subunit complex consisting of Hrad1 and one or more Hrad17 molecules. We were unable to demonstrate the interaction between Hrad17 and Hrad1 when Hrad1 was expressed as a GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion. Given the small size of Hrad1 we interpret these results to indicate that the fusion is inhibiting the interaction with Hrad17. In the absence of more sophisticated biochemical reagents such as antibodies to Hrad1 and Hrad17, we are unable to confirm the interaction between Hrad1 and Hrad17 by an independent method. Given the sequence similarity between Hrad17 and replication factor C, it is possible that Hrad17 is a DNA-binding protein or interacts with DNA replication proteins. Hrad17 might then act to bring other components of the checkpoint complex such as Hrad1 into close proximity with DNA. The interaction with Hrad1 would provide the exonuclease activity required for the degradation of DNA as proposed by Lydall and Weinert (47Lydall D. Weinert T. Science. 1995; 270: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Hrad17 may also preferentially recognize damaged DNA; however, to assess any potential DNA binding activity we will need to purify Hrad17. Our attempts to express and purify Hrad17 overexpressed inEscherichia coli have been unsuccessful. We find that Hrad17 is extremely unstable when overexpressed, a situation that has also been observed for the S. pombe Rad17 protein. In summary, these results describe a human homologue of S. pombe Rad17 that interacts with Hrad1 but not Hrad9. This provides further evidence of the conservation between yeast and mammals of checkpoint pathways at the molecular level. A detailed analysis of the interactions between Hrad17 and other checkpoint and DNA replication proteins and a biochemical analysis of the properties of Hrad17 are now required to fully establish the role that this protein plays in cell cycle checkpoint control.

Identification of a human homologue of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe rad17+ checkpoint gene.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 274Issue 34PreviewIt has been brought to our attention that the chromosomal location of the gene encoding Hrad17 reported in our manuscript at 4q13.3-21.2 is incorrect (Dr. Mau-Sun Chang, personal communication). This was due to an error in the identification of the chromosome labeled by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a Hrad17 cDNA probe as chromosome 4 rather than 5 (due to similar DAPI banding pattern).

https://openalex.org/W2058747766,"Abstract In the purple non-sulfur bacteriumRhodobacter capsulatus, RegA and RegB comprise a two-component regulatory system that is required for maximal anaerobic transcription of key photosynthesis genes. RegB is a sensor kinase that uses ATP to phosphorylate its cognate response regulator, RegA. The mechanism under which RegA∼P influences transcription of target genes has been unclear given that past attempts to demonstrate DNA binding activity by isolated RegA have failed. This led to a model invoking a role for RegA∼P as an intermediate in a more complex multicomponent phosphoryl transfer cascade. In the present study, we describe the isolation of a mutant version of RegA (RegA*) which promotes high level expression of photosynthesis genes independent of RegB. DNase I footprint analyses show that purified RegA* binds to the promoters of the puf and puc operons at locations that are consistent with RegA functioning as a transcriptional activator for these operons. We conclude that RegA functions, like most members of the response regulator family, as a DNA-binding protein that directly affects the expression of its target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2034865913,"SKP1 is involved in the ubiquitination of certain cell cycle and nutritional regulatory proteins for rapid turnover. SKP1 from Dictyostelium has been known to be modified by an oligosaccharide containing Fuc and Gal, which is unusual for a cytoplasmic or nuclear protein. To establish how it is glycosylated, SKP1 labeled with [3H]Fuc was purified to homogeneity and digested with endo-Lys-C. A single radioactive peptide was found after two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography. Analysis in a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer revealed a predominant ion with a novel mass. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis yielded a set of daughter ions which identified the peptide and showed that it was modified at Pro-143. A second series of daughter ions showed that Pro-143 was hydroxylated and derivatized with a potentially linear pentasaccharide, Hex→Hex→Fuc→Hex→HexNAc→(HyPro). The attachment site was confirmed by Edman degradation. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of trimethylsilyl-derivatives of overexpressed SKP1 after methanolysis showed the HexNAc to be GlcNAc. Exoglycosidase digestions of the glycopeptide from normal SKP1 and from a fucosylation mutant, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis, showed that the sugar chain consisted ofd-Galpα1→6-d-Galpα1→l-Fucpα1→2-d-Galpβ1→3GlcNAc. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of all SKP1 peptides resolved by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography showed that SKP1 was only partially hydroxylated at Pro-143 and that all hydroxylated SKP1 was completely glycosylated. Thus SKP1 is variably modified by an unusual linear pentasaccharide, suggesting the localization of a novel glycosylation pathway in the cytoplasm. SKP1 is involved in the ubiquitination of certain cell cycle and nutritional regulatory proteins for rapid turnover. SKP1 from Dictyostelium has been known to be modified by an oligosaccharide containing Fuc and Gal, which is unusual for a cytoplasmic or nuclear protein. To establish how it is glycosylated, SKP1 labeled with [3H]Fuc was purified to homogeneity and digested with endo-Lys-C. A single radioactive peptide was found after two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography.

Thus SKP1 is variably modified by an unusual linear pentasaccharide, suggesting the localization of a novel glycosylation pathway in the cytoplasm. SKP1 is found in a multiprotein complex with cullin (acdc53 homologue) and an F-box-containing protein to form the SCF complex, named as an acronym of the participating proteins. When this complex contains an E2 enzyme, it is responsible for ubiquitinating various target proteins, depending on the identity of the F-box protein. Targets for subsequent degradation identified inSaccharomyces cerevisiae include cell cycle proteins such as the S-phase kinase inhibitor SIC1 and G1 cyclins, and proteins specific to the nutrition of the cell (1Bai C.

An SCF complex with Cyclin A and Cdk2 has been detected in mammalian cells, and its abundance appears increased in transformed cells (7Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 368-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). SKP1 itself is abundantly and dynamically expressed in the mouse embryo (9Sowden J. Morrison K. Schofield J. Putt W. Edwards Y.

The expression of several SKP1 genes in plants appears to be governed by morphogenetic boundaries (13Ingram G.C. Doyle S. Carpenter R. Schultz E.A. Simon R. Coen E.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6521-6534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus SKP1 is expressed ubiquitously in eukaryotes, and its role may be to facilitate the selection of other proteins for specific posttranslational modification. Binding of SKP1 to different proteins may be regulated structurally because it is encoded by multiple genes in multicellular organisms (1Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar,11Chen H. Thalmann I. Adams J.C. Avraham K.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Beier D.R. Corey D.P.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 184: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). SKP1 structure is also altered by glycosylation inDictyostelium discoideum (17Gonzalez-Yanes B. Cicero J.M.

Because complex glycosylation of cytoplasmic/nuclear proteins is unusual, we embarked on a study to establish the structure of the carbohydrate modification as a first step in investigating its function. To determine the structure and site of attachment of the previously described SKP1 fuco-oligosaccharide(s) (17Gonzalez-Yanes B. Cicero J.M. Brown Jr., R.D. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9595-9605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kozarov E. van der Wel H. Field M. Gritzali M. Brown Jr., R.D. West C.M. J. Biol.

Key to the success of the this methodology was the newly developed Q-TOF MS 1The abbreviations used are: Q-TOF MS, quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Fuc, l-fucose; Gal, d-galactose; GlcNAc,N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RP-HPLC, reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; GC/MS, gas chromatography mass spectrometry; cFTase, cytosolic fucosyltransferase; TMS, trimethylsilyl. 1The abbreviations used are: Q-TOF MS, quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Fuc, l-fucose; Gal, d-galactose; GlcNAc,N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RP-HPLC, reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; GC/MS, gas chromatography mass spectrometry; cFTase, cytosolic fucosyltransferase; TMS, trimethylsilyl.

Paxton T. Panico M. McDowell R. Dell A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which permitted MS-MS studies to be performed on the picomole quantities of material available from native sources. This recently designed instrument comprises a quadrupole with collision cell followed by an orthogonal acceleration TOF analyzer that confers a high degree of sensitivity and accuracy to the mass measurements. The ability of this instrument to sequence both the peptide and oligosaccharide chains of an SKP1 fucoglycopeptide suggested that it consists of a linear pentasccharide attached to hydroxylated Pro-143. The sugar sequence was established from exoglycosidase studies using MALDI-TOF MS and sugar analyses on genetically overexpressed material. The protein attachment site was then confirmed by Edman degradation. These results reinforce the model that complex O-linked glycosylation occurs in the eukaryotic cytoplasmic compartment. Whereas there has been much circumstantial evidence to support this model (21Hart G.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Kelly W.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 841-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), it has remained controversial (22Medina L. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, simple glycosylation, in the form of GlcNAc O-linked to residues of Ser or Thr, is well established in this compartment (23Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The sugar structures that have been described to date on cytoplasmic/nuclear proteins are generally distinctive from those produced in the secretory pathway, suggesting that there may be fundamental differences in the biogenesis and function of these modifications. A full-length cDNA from the fpa1 gene with a decapeptide encoding the human c-myc epitope (24Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) inserted between codons 161 and 162 near the C terminus was prepared by PCR and cloned into pT7Blue (Novagen). The cDNA was subcloned into pVEIIΔATG (25Rebstein P.J. Weeks G. Spiegelman G.B. Dev. Genet. 1993; 14: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) under the control of the inducible discoidin promoter and the actin 8 terminator. The plasmid was transformed into D. discoideum by a CaPO4 precipitation method and selected in the presence of 15 μg/ml G418 (26Ferguson T.F. Vozenilek J. West C.M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1994; 36: 597-604Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Strain HW120 was a clone that produced SKP1-c-myc at high levels after growth in 120 μg/ml G418, based on Western blot analysis with monoclonal antibody 9E10 against the c-myc epitope. SKP1-c-myc contained two missense mutations, T194C and A305G resulting in the amino acid substitutions I34T and D71G, introduced by the PCR reaction and confirmed by MS analysis of its peptides (data not shown). D. discoideum strains Ax3, HL250, or HW120 were grown to stationary phase in HL-5 medium (17Gonzalez-Yanes B. Cicero J.M. Brown Jr., R.D. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9595-9605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were filter-lysed, and an S100 fraction was prepared by ultracentrifugation (17Gonzalez-Yanes B. Cicero J.M. Brown Jr., R.D. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9595-9605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SKP1 from Ax3 and HL250 were fractionated into pools-I and -II by DEAE-anion exchange chromatography (14West C.M. Kozarov E. Teng-umnuay P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 200: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); SKP1-c-myc from strain HW120 eluted after pool-II. Each pool was subsequently purified by phenyl-Sepharose and monoclonal antibody 3F9 affinity chromatographies (14West C.M. Kozarov E. Teng-umnuay P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 200: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling, a 200-ml culture of Ax3 cells was grown for three generations in 0.05 mCi/ml [3H]Fuc in HL-5. SKP1 was isolated in the same manner except the phenyl-Sepharose step was omitted, and purified radiolabeled SKP1 was pooled with unlabeled SKP1. In some cases, SKP1 was reduced and carboxamidomethylated (14West C.M. Kozarov E. Teng-umnuay P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 200: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and further purified on a C2/C18 (PC 3.2/3) RP-HPLC column on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SmartSystem HPLC (14West C.M. Kozarov E. Teng-umnuay P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 200: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The peak that contained >80% of total SKP1 was examined further. Recombinant SKP1 (fpa1) containing an N-terminal oligo-His tag was isolated fromEscherichia coli as described (27West C.M. Scott-Ward T. Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H. Kozarov E. Huynh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12024-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and further purified on an RP column. 2 nmol of mannitol was added as an internal standard to 1.5 nmol of SKP1-c-myc. The sample was subjected to methanolysis, re-N-acetylation, and TMS-derivitization as described (28Elwood P.C. Reid W.K. Marcell P.D. Allen R.H. Kolhouse J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and analyzed in splitless mode on a 0.32 mm x 30 m SPB-1 column (Supelco) on a Shimadzu QP-5000 GC/MS workstation. Peaks were analyzed with selected ion monitoring atm/z 204 for the neutral sugars andm/z 173 for the N-acetylated amino sugars. Carboxamidomethylated SKP1 was digested with endo-Lys-C from Achromobacter lyticus(Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA) in the presence of 2 m urea in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, using an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:200 (mol:mol), at 30 °C for 18 h. Peptides from metabolically labeled SKP1 were fractionated on a Superdex Peptide HR10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 6 m urea in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, on an LKB GTi HPLC system at 0.5 ml/min. Radioactive fractions were applied to a 4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5-μm particle C8 column (Zorbax) and eluted with a gradient of 5% (v/v) MeCN in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to 40% MeCN in 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid at 1 ml/min. Peptides (20 pmol) were subjected to Edman degradation on an ABI model 494 Procise sequenator. Nonradiolabeled peptides were fractionated directly on the C8 or a C2/C18 (PC 2.1/10; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) RP-column. Samples were mixed with an equal volume of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) in 70% MeCN. 1 μl (2–3 pmol) was deposited on a sample plate and air dried. Spectra were collected on a PerSeptive Biosystem Voyager RP MALDI-TOF MS operated in the positive ion, linear mode. Samples from RP fractions were introduced directly into the Q-TOF MS (Micromass, UK) via a nanospray device (19Morris H.R. Paxton T. Dell A. Langhorne J. Berg M. Bordoli R.S. Hoyes J. Bateman R.H. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 20Morris H.R. Paxton T. Panico M. McDowell R. Dell A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Primary and secondary ion spectra were collected in the positive ion mode. 15 pmol of glycopeptide from RP fractions were partially dried by vacuum centrifugation, diluted to a final volume of 2.5 μl with the glycosidase preparation, incubated for 18 h at 37 °C, and processed for MALDI-TOF MS. Nonsusceptible substrates yielded no new ions after digestion. Green coffee bean α-galactosidase (Galα1→4>2,3≫6) from Boehringer Mannheim was further purified as described (29Jacob G.S. Scudder P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and used at 10 milliunits/μl in 50 mmammonium phosphate, pH 6.0. Recombinant α-galactosidase (Galα1→3) from Glyko (Novato, CA) was used at 10 microunits/μl in 20 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 6.0. Xanthomonus manihotis α-galactosidase (Galα1→3/6) from New England Biolabs was used at 10 microunits/μl in 20 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 6.0. Sweet almond β-glucosidase (Glu/Gal/Fucβ→) from Boehringer Mannheim was used at 10 milliunits/μl in 20 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 5.0. Bovine kidney α-fucosidase (Fucα1→2/3/4/6) from Boehringer Mannheim was used at 2.5 milliunits/μl in 20 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 5.0.X. manihotis α-fucosidase (Fucα1→2) from New England Biolabs was used at 100 milliunits/μl together with purified green coffee bean α-galactosidase in 50 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 6.0. Bovine kidney β-galactosidase (Galβ1→3/4>6) from Oxford GlycoSciences (Abingdon, UK) was used at 4 milliunits/μl in 25 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.0. Recombinant β-galactosidase (Galβ1→3/6) from Glyko was used at 4.8 milliunits/μl in 20 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 5.0. X. manihotisβ-galactosidase (Galβ1→3) from New England Biolabs was used at 4.8 milliunits/μl in 20 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 5.0. Jack bean β-HexNAcase (GlcNAc/GalNAcβ→) from V-Labs was used at 6.5 milliunits/μl together with bovine kidney β-galactosidase in 20 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 5.0. The peptide fraction was partially dried in a vacuum centrifuge, reconstituted in 10 μl of 0.05 m trifluoroacetic acid, and incubated at 95 °C for up to 6 h. To investigate the glycosylation of SKP1, normal cells (strain Ax3) were metabolically labeled with [3H]Fuc, and SKP1 was purified to homogeneity. Reduced and alkylated SKP1 was digested with endo-Lys-C and fractionated on a Superdex peptide gel filtration column (Fig. 1 A). Radioactivity eluted as a single peak. When fraction 23 was separated on a C8 RP-HPLC column, radioactivity again eluted in a single peak, which was centered at fraction 35, did not absorb at 280 nm, and contained 30% of the original radioactivity (Fig. 1 B). These results suggested that SKP1 contained only a single fucoglycopeptide. A parallel experiment using nonradioactive Fuc yielded material for MS analysis. The HPLC fraction (number 35) containing the putative fucoglycopeptide was subjected to tandem mass spectrometry on a Q-TOF mass spectrometer. Analysis of a few picomoles in the MS-only mode gave a major [M+3H]3+ signal atm/z 829.42 (Fig. 2, including inset). Note the resolved natural abundance13C isotopes at m/z 829.70 and 830.03 showing that this signal is triply charged. It therefore derives from a molecule of mass 2485 Da. A series of doubly charged ions was also apparent in the spectrum, separated by sugar mass differences (m/z 1244, 1163, 1081, 1008, and 927). The ion atm/z 1244 is the [M+2H]2+ ion corresponding to the [M+3H]3+ atm/z 829.42, and the mass differences from this correspond to intervals of Hex, Hex, Fuc, and Hex, respectively. MS/MS of the m/z 829 [M+3H]3+ ion using argon gas and 50 eV collision energy produced the spectrum shown in Fig. 3. Interestingly, the spectrum shows the formation (from m/z 829) of a number of doubly charged ions at m/z 826, 927, 1009, 1081 and 1163 separated by sugar mass differences of HexNAc, Hex, Fuc, and Hex, respectively, suggesting a stepwise stripping of these sugars from a linear oligosaccharide attached to the glycopeptide. These data confirm that, in the MS spectrum shown in Fig. 2, the labeled doubly charged ions were formed in that case by cone-voltage-induced fragmentation from a true quasimolecular ion atm/z 829. The doubly charged ion atm/z 826 (Fig. 3) showed no evidence of further sugar loss and is interpreted as the remaining peptide backbone. This is confirmed by the presence of a major singly charged quasimolecular ion signal at m/z 1651 [M+H]+ for the peptide. A search for this mass in the gene-derived sequence finds nothing, but the peptide identity can be determined from the presence of N- and C-terminal sequence ions (30Morris H.R. Panico M. Barber M. Bordoli R.S. Sedgwick R.D. Tyler A.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (b andy“, respectively) in the low mass range of the spectrum. This shows the presence of a C-terminal Lys in the molecule via an ion at m/z 147 that is extended via signals atm/z 303 (y”2), 416 (y“3), 544 (y”4), 673 (y“5), and 802 (y”6) (Figs. 3 and 4 A) to give the sequence … EEQL/IRK. Note the relatively high intensity of them/z 544 isotope peak at m/z545 (Fig. 4 A) showing that the Q residue is partially deamidated. This is observed in all ions containing that residue and also accounts for the high intensity of the 1651.79 satellite to the quasimolecular ion signal in Fig. 3. The partial sequence determined from the C-terminal (y“) ions is further complemented by N-terminal (b) ions atm/z 230, 377, and 478 corresponding to a (230)-F-T sequence. The sequence ion data thus lock the peptide portion of the molecule onto residues 139–151 in the sequence (NDFTPEEEEQIRK) except that the mass found in the Q-TOF MS/MS collision spectrum is 16 Da higher than that predicted for the peptide (1635 [M+H]+). This is interpreted as a posttranslational hydroxylation of one of the amino acids present, and this could not be at the C-terminal Lys residue, already assigned in the fragmentation data.Figure 4Parts of the MS/MS spectrum shown in Fig. 3expanded to show fragment ions more clearly. A, low mass region containing peptide-derived fragment ions. B, higher mass region containing peptide and glycopeptide fragment ions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Screening the higher mass fragments in the spectrum allows a clear assignment of where the 16-Da increment is attached via the signals atm/z 1060 and 1173 in Fig. 4 B. These show that the Pro C-terminal sequence ion, y9“, is 16 Da higher than the theoretical value for the sequence (1057 Da), showing that it is a HyPro in this position. The signals at m/z 1274 and 1421 complete a series showing -F-T-P(OH)- in the sequence. Importantly, Fig. 4 B also allows assignment of the attachment site of the carbohydrate to the peptide. The signal atm/z 1376 is a HexNAc residue away from them/z 1173 ion, showing that the carbohydrate is attached via a HexNAc residue to the HyPro and not, as may have been expected, to the Thr residue. A further signal atm/z 1477 extends this ion series to the y“10 sequence ion TP(OH)EEEEQIRK substituted with HexNAc on the HyPro. The signal at m/z 1538 corresponds to the y”9 ion with a Hex-HexNAc substituent, and the sugar sequence data assigned from the doubly charged ions at m/z 826, 927, 1008, 1081, 1163, and 1244 (Figs. 2 and 3) now overlaps the singly charged MS/MS glycopeptide data giving confirmation of the sequence. MS/MS data on several of the cone-voltage-induced doubly charged glycopeptide fragment ions also corroborated the above interpretation (data not shown). A mild trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis experiment on a remaining small quantity of sample showed the disappearance of them/z 829 triply charged signal together with the other doubly charged ions, excepting m/z 1008 and a weak triply charged signal at m/z 672, suggesting, as do the MS/MS data, that the saccharide is a linear molecule with Fuc mid-chain. Taking all the MS and MS-MS data into consideration the structure of the fucoglycopeptide was assigned as NDFT(Hex→Hex→Fuc→Hex→HexNAc)hydroxyPEEEEQIRK. Subsequent Edman degradation sequencing on a 20-pmol sample confirmed the entire sequence of 13 residues, except for a blank at cycle 5, expected to be Pro. MALDI-TOF MS of the fucoglycopeptide provided corroborative evidence for the carbohydrate sequence predicted from the Q-TOF experiments. The MALDI spectrum contained a major M+H+ signal at m/z 2487 (Fig. 5 A) which was equivalent to the triply charged ion at m/z 829.70 in the Q-TOF spectrum. In addition, a series of low abundance ions were observed atm/z 2326, 2164, 2017, 1855, and 1652 consistent with sequential loss of Hex, Hex, Fuc, Hex, and HexNAc, respectively. The low abundance ions appeared to be fragmentation products of them/z 2487 ion resulting from similar frequency of scission of each of the glycosidic linkages (31Dell A. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem.

Them/z 2487 ion was not seen in a similar analysis of RP-fractionated peptides (see below) of recombinant SKP1 isolated from E. coli (data not shown), showing that it was specific to the protein expressed in Dictyostelium. To determine its monosaccharide composition, SKP1 was isolated from the S100 fraction of a D. discoideum strain (HW120) genetically modified to overexpress, under the control of the inducible discoidin promoter, a form of the protein with a c-myc-epitope tag near its C terminus. The sugars of purified SKP1-c-myc were examined by GC/MS after methanolysis, re-N-acetylation, and formation of TMS derivatives. To achieve the sensitivity required to analyze 1.5 nmol of SKP1-c-myc, splitless injection and selected ion monitoring were employed. Fuc (0.33 nmol), Gal (0.70 nmol), and GlcNAc (0.32 nmol) were the three most abundant sugars detected, and their low levels indicated that overexpressed SKP1 was under-glycosylated. No GalNAc was detected. Fuc, Gal, and Xyl were previously detected after 2m trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis (18Kozarov E. van der Wel H. Field M. Gritzali M. Brown Jr., R.D. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3022-3030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but GlcNAc was not. The stronger acid conditions of methanolysis were probably required to liberate GlcNAc from its linkage with HyPro, and Xyl is not found in the fucoglycopeptide according to the MS results. Thus the GC/MS data showed that the deoxyHex residue identified by MS wasl-Fuc, as suggested by metabolic labeling, and showed that all three Hex residues were Gal and the HexNAc was GlcNAc. To assign linkages, the fucoglycopeptide was treated with exoglycosidases and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The mass of the glycopeptide was reduced by two Gal residues (to m/z 2163) after treatment with the nonspecific green coffee bean α-d-galactosidase (Fig. 5 C) but was not altered by nonspecific bovine kidney β-galactosidase, sweet almond β-glucosidase, or bovine kidney α-fucosidase. Furthermore, one Gal residue was susceptible to removal by X. manihotis α1→3/6-galactosidase (Fig. 5 B) but not recombinant Glyko α1→3-galactosidase, showing that it was α1→6-linked. Fuc was susceptible to removal (yielding m/z 2017) only after removal of the α-linked Gal residues, as shown by double enzyme digestion experiments employing the α-galactosidase and either nonspecific bovine kidney α-fucosidase or X. manihotisα1→2-l-fucosidase (Fig. 5 D). Because Fuc does not contain a 6-linkage site, this means that Fuc was capped by a Galα1→6Gal disaccharide, and the disaccharide was α-linked tol-Fuc. These results indicate that the outer sugars form a linear trisaccharide, Galα1→6Galα1→Fucα1→2, in accord with the MS data. A time course MALDI-TOF MS analysis during mild acid hydrolysis of the fucoglycopeptide yielded a mass decrease of two Hex residues and one deoxyHex residue (m/z 2487 tom/z 2017) with no intermediates detected, as also seen in the corresponding Q-TOF experiment (see above), confirming that the outer Galα-linked residues were attached to the acid-labile internal Fuc residue, whose more rapid release resulted in the simultaneous loss of all three sugars. The core region of the glycan was examined in a mutant strain (HL250) that does not synthesize GDP-Fuc and does not fucosylate SKP1 (18Kozarov E. van der Wel H. Field M. Gritzali M. Brown Jr., R.D.

It was predicted that this strain would produce the truncated sugar chain Gal→GlcNAc if alternative processing did not occur. HL250 SKP1 purified from pool II of the S100 fraction resolved into two closely spaced peaks during RP-HPLC, each yielding similar results. Each peak was digested with e"
https://openalex.org/W1985378803,"We have identified five cDNA clones that encode nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits expressed in the nervous system of the locust Locusta migratoria. Four of the subunits are ligand-binding α subunits, and the other is a structural β subunit. The existence of at least one more nAChR gene, probably encoding a β subunit, is indicated.Based on Northern analysis and in situ hybridization, the five subunit genes are expressed. locα1, locα3, andlocβ1 are the most abundant subunits and are expressed in similar areas of the head ganglia and retina of the adult locust. Because Locα3 binds α-bungarotoxin with high affinity, it may form a homomeric nAChR subtype such as the mammalian α7 nAChR. Locα1 and Locβ1 may then form the predominant heteromeric nAChR in the locust brain. locα4 is mainly expressed in optic lobe ganglionic cells and locα2 in peripherally located somata of mushroom body neurons. locα3 mRNA was additionally detected in cells interspersed in the somatogastric epithelium of the locust embryo, suggesting that this isoform may also be involved in functions other than neuronal excitability. Transcription of all nAChR subunit genes begins approximately 3 days before hatching and continues throughout adult life.Electrophysiological recordings from head ganglionic neurons also indicate the existence of more than one functionally distinct nAChR subtype.

In insects, neuromuscular transmission is mediated by glutamate, whereas acetylcholine is the principal neurotransmitter in the nervous system (1Gerschenfeld H.M. Physiol. Rev. 1973; 53: 1-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence suggests the existence of both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR) 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; αBTX, α-bungarotoxin; κBTX, κ-bungarotoxin; dNTP, desoxynucleotide triphosphate; TM, transmembrane domain; dn, embryonic day. receptors in the insect brain, with nAChR-coding RNAs having been identified in several species, including the fruit fly Drosophila (2Gundelfinger E.D.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.14-7.15Google Scholar). Considerable pharmacological diversity of nicotinic receptors is indicated by the existence of αBTX-sensitive and -insensitive receptors (6Satelle D.B. Adv. Insect Physiol. 1980; 15: 215-315Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Benke D. Breer H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1989; 1: 71-80Google Scholar) and by the rather wide variation of responses to nicotinic and non-nicotinic drugs of insect neurons and membrane preparations (8Breer H. Satelle D.B. J. Insect Physiol. 1987; 33: 771-790Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Benson J.A. Pichon Y. Comparative Molecular Neurobiology. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1993: 390-413Crossref Google Scholar). In particular, the nAChR of Locusta migratoria was suggested to have mixed nicotinic and muscarinic pharmacology (10Breer H. Neurochem. Int. 1981; 3: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which could correlate with the greater evolutionary age of orthoperians as compared with dipterians. Vertebrate neuronal nicotinic receptors are quite diverse (11Lindstrom J. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 377-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), with to date eight α subunits and three β subunits cloned in the rat. Of these, the α7, α8, and α9 subunits have the unique ability to form functional homomeric receptors (12Bertrand D. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 146: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13Gerzanich V. Anand R. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 212-220PubMed Google Scholar, 14Elgoyhen A.B. Johnson D.S. Boulter J. Vetter D.E. Heinemann S. Cell. 1994; 18: 705-715Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Various combinations of the other α and β subunits also give rise to functional receptors, as is exemplified by combinations of α4 and β2 subunits and of α3 and β4 subunits expressed in hippocampal neurons (15Alkondon M. Reinhardt S. Lobron C. Hermsen B. Maelicke A. Albuquerque E.X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 494-506PubMed Google Scholar). The stoichiometries of heteromeric neuronal nAChRs are not yet established. The homo-oligomeric receptors appear to be the evolutionarily oldest (16Le Novère N. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which has led to the suggestion that the invertebrate neuronal nAChR from L. migratoria, given its broad pharmacology, may be an α7-like homo-oligomeric receptor (17Breer H. Kleene R. Hinz G. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3386-3392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hanke W. Breer H. Nature. 1986; 321: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). InDrosophila, five different putative nAChR subunits have been identified, three of which contain the two adjacent cysteines that are characteristic of ligand-binding α subunits (2Gundelfinger E.D. Hess N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The subunit compositions and stoichiometries of insect nicotinic receptors are still unknown. This is in part due to the fact that expression in Xenopus oocytes of insect nAChR subunit RNA and cDNA has generally proven to be difficult (19Lansdell S.J. Schmitt B. Betz H. Satelle D.B. Millar N. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For the same reason, it has not yet been possible to determine the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of single subtypes of insect nicotinic receptors. In the present study, we show that in the locust L. migratoria at least six different genes exist that encode nAChR subunits. Four of these genes encode for α subunits. Although we were unable to demonstrate heterologous functional expression inXenopus oocytes of single subunits, or combinations of subunits, in situ hybridization studies show that the identified subunits are expressed in vivo and probably form functional receptors with different quarternary structures. Because insect nAChRs represent important targets for insecticides (20Satelle D.B. Buckingham S.D. Wafford K.A. Sherby S.M. Bakry N.M. Eldefrawi A.T. Eldefrawi M.E. May T.E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond.

Physiol. 1994; 48: 202-213Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the structural and functional characterization of such receptors may be useful in the context of rational drug design. Locust eggs were supplied by Futtertierversand Hintze, Berlin (Germany). Dr. August Dorn (Institute of Zoology, University Mainz) provided live adult locusts, and Dr. Heinz Breer (Institute of Zoology, Stuttgart-Hohenheim; Germany) provided muscle and ganglia tissue from adult locusts. AL. migratoria genomic library was constructed using the lambdoid phage NM1149 in combination with the hfl mutantEscherichia coli strain POP13b, which suppresses the lytic cycle of non-recombinant phages. Chromosomal DNA was prepared from muscle tissue of adult locusts as described (22Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). DNA was restricted with EcoRI, fractionated on a 0.7% agarose gel, and fragments from 3.8 to 5.4 kilobase pairs length were isolated. Samples of 100 ng of fractionated DNA were ligated with 1 μg ofEcoRI-restricted NM1149-DNA and packaged. Packaging efficiency was 8 × 105 lytic plaques per 100 ng ofLocusta DNA. The E. coli strain POP13b was infected with 1.5 × 106 recombinant plaques, and the genomic library was screened using a [α-32P]dATP randomly labeled 650-bp fragment from the Drosophila ARD cDNA (23Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Zopf D. Ryseck R.-P. Hovemann B. Betz H. Gundelfinger E.D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1503-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Filters were hybridized overnight and washed with low stringency (2× SSC, 55 °C; 20× SSC, saline sodium citrate: 0.3 m sodium citrate, 3m NaCl). After 48 h exposure two positive signals were identified. These phages were plated with lower density and hybridized. Two recombinants were isolated and characterized. A 177-bpAluI fragment of one of these recombinants coded for the full second transmembrane domain (TM2), the following short loop, and part of the third transmembrane domain (TM3) of a nAChR. This fragment was used as screening probe in further experiments. A L. migratoriacDNA library was constructed in λgt11. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from ganglionic tissue and reverse-transcribed to double strand DNA using hexanucleotide primers. cDNA was ligated toEcoRI linkers and cloned into λgt11. E. colistrain BHB2600 was infected 5.5 × 106 recombinants. 600,000 phages were plated with high density (50,000 plaques/13-cm dish). Screening was performed using randomly primed [α-32P]dATP-labeled 177-bp AluI fragment. Filters were washed under low stringency (2× SSC, 55 °C). Positive phages were re-plated with lower density (100–200 plaques/8-cm dish) and re-hybridized. RNA was prepared from d9 embryos, and single strand cDNA was prepared from 5 μg of total RNA using a mixture of oligo(dT)12–18 and random primers. Reaction was carried out using 400 units of Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the provider's protocol. 1 ng of single strand cDNA was amplified in a first polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 3′-primers highly specific for Locα1 (5′-CTCGAGGGACATGTAGAACTCGGAGAGGTC-3′) and a mix of two 5′-primers (5′-ACCGCCTCATCAGGCCTGTCACCAACAACTCCGA-3′ and 5′-ACCGCCTCATCAGGCCTGTCGGCAACAACTCGGA-3′) designed to highly homologous regions of locα2 and locα3cDNA clones (aa 15–21 of locα2 and aa 4–10 oflocα3, respectively). Both 5′-primers contained a silent mutation to introduce a StuI site (bold letters) which was later used to fuse the rat α3 nAChR signal peptide to the locust α1 clone. PCR products were diluted 1:100 and re-amplified in a second PCR using the same 5′-primers and another 3′-primer (5′-GGCAGGCACCTCGAGGATGTCCCA-3′) designed to the already amplified fragments. Both PCRs were carried out in a volume of 20 μl under the following conditions: 1 × Taq buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 pm of each primer, 5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, 50 mmTris-HCl. pH 9.5, 2.5 units of Taq Polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation at 94 °C, 5 min amplification was carried out in a Perkin-Elmer Thermocycler Gene AmpTMPCR System 2400, running 39 cycles (94 °C, 1 min; 58 °C, 1, 5 min; 72 °C, 2, 5 min), and finally incubating at 72 °C, 10 min. PCR products were fractionated, and 600-bp fragments were cloned into pSL1180 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Clones containinglocα1-specific sequences were isolated by colony hybridization (Sambrook et al., 1989) using a [α-32P]dATP-labeled oligo (5′-CTCGAGGGACATGTAGAACTCGGAGAGGTC-3′), which is highly specific forlocα1. They were then sequenced, and one of them was fused to the partial locα1 cDNA clone. TheBamHI/EcoRI fragment of the rat α3 nAChR cDNA (24Deneris E.S. Conolly J. Rogers S.W. Duvoisin R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and the locust α2, α3, and β cDNAs were cloned into pBluescript® KS+ (Stratagene). A StuI site was introduced into the 5′-end of these clones by PCR without changing the Arg/Pro amino acid sequence at this site. PCR was performed with 1 ng of each clone under the same conditions as described above. Amplification of the locust clones was carried out using a 3′-primer, designed to the pBluescript® KS+ sequence (5′-AACAGCTATGACCATG-3′), and the following specific 5′-primers containing a silent mutation (in order to introduce a StuI site; see in bold letters) (locα2, 5′-ACCGCCTCATCAGGCCTGTCACCAACAACTCCGA-3′;locα3, 5′-ACCGCCTCATCAGGCCTGTCGGCAACAACTCGGA-3′; locβ, 5′-ACAAGCTCATCAGGCCTGTGCAGAACATGACGCA-3′). Amplification of the rat α3 nAChR fragment was carried out with 2 ng of cloned DNA using the following primers: 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′, 5′-CCTCCGAATTCTCCGGA-GATGATCTCGTTGTAAT-3′). PCR products were cloned into pBluescript® KS+ and sequenced. The StuI site was then used to fuse the rat α3 nAChR signal sequence to each of the locust cDNA clones. In situ hybridization was performed with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes. RNA probes were randomly labeled with digoxigenin according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). In order to obtain isoform-specific probes, sequence regions with lowest homology were selected, i.e. for locα1 and locα2clones from the “cytoplasmic loop” between TM3 and TM4, forlocβ from parts of the 5′-translated region, forlocα3 from the 3′-untranslated region, and forlocα4 from the 5′-untranslated region. The isoform specificity of the RNA probes was confirmed by Southern analysis. Whole embryos and head ganglia with attached optic lobes and retina from adult locusts were dissected out of the eggshell and individual adult insect, respectively, placed in embedding medium (Tissue Tec, Miles), and shock-frozen with dry ice. They were kept at −70 °C until use. 6–9-μm frozen sections were obtained at −20 °C using a Slee (Mainz, Germany) cryostat. Cryosections were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 10 min, washed 4 times for 5 min with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and incubated in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 50 μg/ml tRNA, 50 μg/ml heparin, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at 50 °C. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were added, and the cryosections were incubated overnight. After five washes for 20 min in 2× SSC, 50% formamide, and treatment with RNase A (25 mg/ml) and RNase T1 in 2× SSC, 8 further washes were performed in which the SSC buffer was diluted out with PBS-T in a stepwise fashion. After incubation for 1 h with PBS, supplemented with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100, the sections were incubated for 30 min with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). After two washes with 100 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, the sections were incubated with 100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mmNaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5, supplemented with the dye reagents nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. After washing the sections for 5 min in PBS, they were covered in PBS, 50% glycerol and were analyzed under the microscope. 10 μg of chromosomal DNA prepared from muscle tissue of adult locusts was completely restricted with EcoRI, BamHI, andHindIII, fractionated, and blotted onto a nylon membrane. The genomic blot was hybridized with the randomly primed [α-32P]dATP-labeled AluI fragment and was washed under moderate stringency (65 °C; 1× SSC). RNA was prepared from embryos d4–d9 after egg laying. 1 mg of RNA was used to prepare poly(A)+ RNA. Every 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA of all six developmental stages was submitted to electrophoresis and blotted onto a nylon membrane. Blots were hybridized with three random primed [α-32P]dATP-labeled probes: a 420-bp HinfI/HinfI fragment of thelocα2 cDNA, a 230-bp EcoRI/SphI fragment of the locβ1 cDNA, and a 370-bpEcoRI/SphI fragment of the locα1cDNA. Blots were washed with 1× SSC, 65 °C. cDNA clones were obtained from the following sources: Drosophila α1 from Marc Ballivet, Geneva, Switzerland (25Bossy B. Ballivet M. Spierer P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); Drosophila α2 from Eckart Gundelfinger, Magdeburg, Germany (26Baumann A. Jonas P. Gundelfinger E.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); andTorpedo α from Toni Claudio, New Haven, CT. cDNA fragments of the N-terminal extracellular regions were expressed either as maltose-binding protein fusions using pMAL-c2 vector from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany) or as glutathioneS-transferase fusions using pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fusion proteins were prepared from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced E. coli transformants (E. coli strain DH5α, Life Technologies, Inc.) of flask submersed cultures. E. colipellets were sonicated in lysis buffer, and after centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted and applied to affinity chromatography. Eluted nAChR fusion proteins were dialyzed, and the purity was determined by capillary electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE. Based on these methods, the purity of fusions proteins was generally better than 85%. In selected examples (Torpedo α fragment), the fusion protein was proteolytically cleaved (factor Xa), and the nAChR fragment was isolated, and terminal peptide sequencing and mass spectrometry were performed. These data confirmed the primary structure of the nAChR fragments. Fusion proteins were separated on a, SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with 10−9m125I-αBTX at 4 °C, 30 min, and washing was performed 5 × for 30 min with 1× PBS. 125I-αBTX was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Braunschweig, Germany). Head (supra-esophageal) ganglia and optic lobes from individual adult L. migratoria were dissected out and placed into dissociation solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany). Dispase (2 mg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) was added and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The material was then centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in culture buffer and was dissociated by gentle aspiration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette (27Usherwood P.N.R. Giles D. Suter C. Insect Neurobiology and Pesticide Action (Neurotox '79). 1980; (Society of Chemical Industry, London): 115-128Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto glass coverslips that were pre-coated with concanavalin A (400 μg/ml, Sigma) and laminin (4 μg/ml, Sigma). The cultures were kept at room temperature and used for electrophysiological measurements on the following 2 days. For electrophysiological recordings, the whole cell patch clamp technique was used. Microelectrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany). The resistance of the fire-polished pipettes was 4–7 megohms, using the internal and external solutions described below. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Cells were placed in a perfusion chamber at approximately 0.5-ml volume and superfused continuously (flow rate 3 ml/min) with external bath solution. The bath solution contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. The (intracellular) pipette solution contained (in mm): 120 CsF, 30 CsCl, 10 Cs-EGTA, 1 CaCl2, pH 7.4 adjusted with CsOH. Currents were measured using an L/M-EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier (List, Darmstadt, Germany). The holding potential was −70 mV. Current records were low pass Bessel filtered at 315 Hz and digitized at 1-kHz sample rate. Data storage and analysis were performed with the pClamp version 6.03 software package (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Test substances were applied to the cells using the U-tube reversed flow technique (28Fenwick E. Marty A. Neher E. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1982; 331: 577-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) with applications of 1–2 s duration at intervals of 1 min. Acetylcholine chloride, cytisine, and coniine were obtained from Sigma. Nicotine bitartrate was obtained from RBI (Natick, MA). Drugs were stored frozen as stock solutions (10 or 100 mm in water) and thawed and diluted on the day of the experiment. The dissociated neurons obtained from head (supra-esophageal) ganglia and optic lobes ofL. migratoria and cultured for 1–2 days on glass coverslips were large, round cells between 30 and 120 μm in diameter, frequently having short protrusions. These cells invariably responded to test applications of 10 μm acetylcholine (ACh) with a fast inward current of between 100 and 2000 pA at −70 mV clamp potential. Dose-response curves obtained with ACh on head ganglion cells (Fig. 1) yielded an EC50 value of 17.9 ± 3.4 μm (n = 7), whereas an EC50 of 19.1 ± 8.9 (n = 4) was measured for optic lobe cells (not shown). In both cases, other nicotinic agonists such as (−)-nicotine or cytisine elicited responses that, even at saturating concentrations, remained well below the maximal currents induced by ACh. The time course of the response to ACh was quite variable from one cell to another. In addition to the rapidly desensitizing component present in most cells, some cells also exhibited a non-desensitizing response to ACh, suggesting the existence of (at least) two nAChR subtypes. Further evidence was provided by dose-response curves for nicotine on cells in which one or the other type of ACh response predominated (Fig. 2). In a cell with mostly rapidly desensitizing ACh-induced currents, nicotine was a weak partial agonist with EC50 >20 μm (29Benson J.A. Clementi F. Gotti C. Sher E. Nato ASI Series H. 25. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 227-240Google Scholar). By contrast, another cell with non-desensitizing ACh currents responded sensitively to nicotine, with an EC50 of <1 μm. Since most cells contained both subtypes of nAChR in varying proportions, the effective EC50 values for nicotine were quite variable (e.g. 9.4 ± 11.4 μm, n = 5 in optic lobe cells). Similar results were obtained with cytisine, whereas coniine acted as agonist exclusively at the non-desensitizing nAChR subtype. Taken together, these data confirm the existence of functional nAChR ion channels in locust neurons and clearly suggest that there exist at least two pharmacologically distinct subtypes of nAChR in the cells studied. A genomic library was prepared from muscle tissue of adult L. migratoria nAChR and was screened with a32P randomly labeled 650-bp long fragment fromDrosophila ARD2 cDNA (23Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Zopf D. Ryseck R.-P. Hovemann B. Betz H. Gundelfinger E.D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1503-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) encoding the transmembrane regions TM1–TM3. We obtained among other clones a 4.1-kilobase pair long genomic fragment that displayed 69.2% homology to theDrosophila ARD2 sequence, 81.6% to theDrosophila ALS sequence, and 75.9% to the chick α4 sequence. An AluI fragment (177 bp) of the genomic clone, containing mostly coding sequences (140 bp) and encoding the full second transmembrane domain (TM2), the following short loop, and part of the third transmembrane domain (TM3), was prepared, randomly labeled with [32P]dATP, and used as probe in a genomic blot of purified DNA from muscle tissue of adult locusts that was cleaved with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI, HindIII, andBamHI. As shown in Fig. 3, at least six bands were detected in each lane, suggesting that this number represents the approximate number of nAChR-coding genes that exist inL. migratoria. After initial information was obtained by Northern analysis (see later for details) for the developmental stages at which nAChR subunit mRNA is expressed in the locust, we prepared a cDNA library from late embryonic stage. By using the32P-labeled genomic AluI fragment described above, we screened the cDNA library at relatively high stringency. We obtained several cDNA clones which coded for four α subunits and one β subunit. The cDNA clones locα2, locα3, and locβ1 encoded for mature subunits, whereas clonelocα1 missed the nucleotides encoding for the first approximately 200 amino acids of the mature protein. All four cDNA clones missed the 5′-terminal sequences encoding the signal sequences. Another cDNA clone isolated encoded the full N-terminal sequence of an α subunit (locα4) but extended only to the end of transmembrane domain 2. The complete sequence of locα1 was obtained by PCR. Attempts to also obtain by PCR the signal sequences of the four full-length cDNA clones were not successful. The mature proteins of L. migratoria Locα1-α3 subunits consist of 559, 515, and 540 amino acids, respectively, with predicted molecular masses of 61.5, 56.7, and 59.4 kDa. The Locβ subunit consists of 497 amino acids with a molecular mass of 54.7 kDa. The nucleotide sequences of the four full-length clones have been reported to the EMBO nucleotide sequence Data Bank (accession numbers AJ000390–000393). Since none of the five cDNAs was identical in sequence to the exon sequence of the genomic AluI fragment used as screening probe (homologies are 79–89% for the α clones, 64% for the β clone), there must exist at least one more gene in L. migratoria that encodes nAChR subunits. In Fig. 4 (upper panel), the hydropathy plot of the Locα2 isoform is representatively shown. As is typical of all isoforms of nAChR identified, it displays the pattern of four putative transmembrane domains (TM1–4) that is common for the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels. The sequences coding for the α-isoforms also contain in their N-terminal extracellular domain the four conserved cysteines (Fig. 4, lower panel), including the two vicinal ones just in front of the first transmembrane domain, and two putativeN-glycosylation sites. The cytoplasmic domain between TM3 and TM4 is quite variable in size (199, 147, 185, and 156 amino acids in Locα1–3 and Locβ1, respectively) and contains several putative phosphorylation sites. In the Locβ1 sequence, this region contains a putative phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent kinase, as was also found in non-α subunits from Torpedo (30Safran A. Provenzano C. Sagi-Eisenberg R. Fuchs S. Maelicke A. NATO ASI Series, Series H: Cell Biology. 32. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1989: 373-380Google Scholar) andDrosophila (23Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Zopf D. Ryseck R.-P. Hovemann B. Betz H. Gundelfinger E.D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1503-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence homologies of the four full-length clones of the L. migratoria nAChR subunits to those of other species are reported in Fig. 5, top andbottom. Functional expression in Xenopusoocytes of insect nAChR following injection of mRNA into the cells has been reported for the cloned α subunit from the locustSchistocerca gregaria (3Marshall J. Buckingham S.D. Shingai R. Lunt G.G. Goosey M.W. Darlison M.G. Satelle D.B. Barnard E.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4391-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Functional channels were formed that were gated by micromolar concentrations of nicotine and that were blocked by αBTX, κBTX, strychnine, and bicuculline. These results suggest that in Schistocerca there exists a homomeric nAChR that has similar physiological properties as the nicotinic responses recorded from insect neurons. In contrast, Drosophila nAChR α subunits so far could only be co-expressed in Xenopusoocytes with the chick neuronal β2 subunit (31Bertrand D. Ballivet M. Gomez M. Bertrand S. Phannavong B. Gundelfinger E.D Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We have undertaken various attempts, so far in vain, to express the cloned L. migratoria nAChR subunits in Xenopusoocytes. To achieve expression, we introduced by silent mutagenesis aStuI restriction site at the 5′-end of each clone, and by using this site, we attached rat α3 signal sequence to theLocusta cDNA clones. We then injected intoXenopus oocytes single subunit cDNA and cDNA mixtures of different subunits or in vitro transcribed mRNA, neither treatment led to any significant channel activity. We also were unable to reproduce for any of the locα clones the successful co-expression in Xenopus oocytes ofDrosophila α subunit with the vertebrate β2 clone (31Bertrand D. Ballivet M. Gomez M.

Coexistence of both ATPases, as well as the presence of various transport and permeability channels in synaptosomal preparations (4Rega A.F. Rega A.F. Garrahan P.J. The Ca2+ Pump of Plasma Membranes.

The main advantages of this procedure were: (i) optimal protein incorporation and orientation, (ii) very low permeability of the proteoliposomal membrane to electrolytes, and (iii) large intravesicular volume which delays back inhibition by high concentrations of lumenal Ca2+ (8Levy D. Seigneuret A. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19524-19534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then studied the functional properties of the reconstituted synaptosomal PMCA, measuring ATP-dependent Ca2+-uptake activity, H+ ejection, and formations of transmembrane electrical potential.MATERIALS AND METHODSEgg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) and egg phosphatidic acid (EPA) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. Calmodulin, calmodulin-agarose, C12E8, FCCP, valinomycin and A23187 were obtained from Sigma. Oxonol VI and 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrene trisulfonate (pyranine) were from Molecular Probes. Bio-Beads SM-2 and the anion exchange chromatography resin AG1X8 were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of the highest purity available.Purification of Plasma Membrane Ca2+-ATPaseThe pig brain plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase was purified as described in Salvador and Mata (5Salvador J.M. Mata A.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh pig brain was homogenized in 10 volumes of 10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 0.32m sucrose, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol. After two centrifugations at low and high speed, respectively, the pellet was layered in a discontinuous 20–40% (w/v) sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 63,000 × g. The synaptosomes obtained in the interface were lysed in a hypotonic medium containing 1 mm EDTA and centrifugated at 20,000 ×g. The synaptic plasma membrane vesicles were obtained in the pellet and solubilized in a medium containing 20 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 130 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm CaCl2, 15% glycerol, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.6% (w/v) Triton X-100. The solubilized fraction was applied onto a calmodulin-agarose column previously equilibrated with the same buffer except that 1 mm MgCl2 and 100 μmCaCl2 was used. Finally the Ca2+-ATPase was eluted in the above buffer containing 0.06% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 2 mm EDTA instead of calcium. The samples were stored at −80°C until use.Preparation of Liposomes and Reconstitution of the Ca2+-ATPaseEPC/EPA (9/1, w/w) liposomes were prepared by reverse phase evaporation as described previously (19Rigaud J.L. Bluzat A. Bluschlen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 20 mm Pipes-K+, pH 7.1, 130 mm KCl (Pipes buffer, pH 7.1). After sequential extrusion through 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 μm nucleopore filters, the liposomes were resuspended at 4 mg/ml in Pipes buffer, pH 7.1, and solubilized by 8 mg/ml C12 E8. The purified Ca2+-ATPase (0.11 mg/ml) was added to the liposomes at a lipid/protein ratio of 150/1 (w/w) and incubated for 2 min. The detergent was then removed in 3 h by subsequent additions of Bio-Beads SM-2 (80 mg/ml/h) under continuous stirring. After complete detergent removal, the proteoliposomes were pipetted off. When measurements of H+ ejection were done, the fluorescent pH indicator pyranine (200 μm) was added in the incubation medium before Bio-Beads addition. After detergent removal, the external pyranine was removed by passing the proteoliposomes through an anion exchange chromatography column (AG1X8).Ca2+-ATPase ActivityThe enzymatic activity was measured at 25 °C by using a coupled enzyme assay following spectrophotometrically the NADH absorption change at 340 nm. The proteoliposomal protein (3 μg/ml) was incubated in 2 ml of a medium containing Pipes buffer, pH 7.1 plus 5 mmMgCl2, 10 μm CaCl2, 0.22 mm NADH, 0.42 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units of pyruvate kinase, and 28 units of lactate dehydrogenase. Additions of 0.2 mm ATP or 1 mm ATP were done to assay the activity of the reconstituted or solubilized protein, respectively.Ca2+ UptakeCa2+uptake by reconstituted proteoliposomes was measured by following the differential absorption of the metallochromic indicator arsenazo III (50 μm) as described previously (20Scarpa A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 301-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A 687–660-nm wavelength pair was used in a dual wavelength spectrophotometer (DW-2000, SLM-Aminco) to monitor changes in external Ca2+concentration. The proteoliposomal protein (6 μg) was incubated at 25 °C in 2 ml of a medium containing Pipes buffer, pH 7.1, plus 0.42 μg/ml calmodulin, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm arsenazo III. The absorbance signal uptake was calibrated by the addition of 10 μm final Ca2+, and the reaction was initiated by adding 0.2 mm ATP.ATP-dependent H+ EjectionLumenal H+ ejection of the proteoliposomes was measured by following the changes in the fluorescence intensity of the pH indicator pyranine that is entrapped during the reconstitution procedure (9Yu X. Carrol S. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1232-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity was measured using a λexc 460 nm and λem 510 nm in a spectrofluorometer (Jasco FP-777). Calibration of lumenal pH changes was done by subsequent additions of 0.5 mn H2SO4 to 2 ml of medium containing 6 μg of proteoliposomal protein in Pipes buffer, pH 7.1, plus 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μmCaCl2, and 4 μm FCCP.The stoichiometry of lumenal H+ was done by taking into account the lumenal volume, as described in Levy et al., 1992 (17Levy D. Gulik A. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The internal volume of the proteoliposomes (400 μl/mg of protein) was taken from Hao et al. (12Hao L. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14268-14275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Electrical Potential AssayThe transmembrane electrical potential was measured by following the differential absorption (625–603 nm) of 2 μm oxonol VI, using dual wavelength spectrophotometry (12Hao L. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14268-14275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was as described for Ca2+ uptake except that oxonol VI was used instead of arsenazo III. The calibration was done by several additions of 130 mm KCl to the medium in the presence of 1 μmof the K+ ionophore valinomycin and in the absence of ATP. Absorption changes were standardized with electrical potential by using the Nernst equation.Protein DeterminationThe protein content was measured by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213347) Google Scholar). The interference of Triton X-100 was avoided by a previous treatment of the samples with Bio-Beads SM-2.SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisElectrophoresis was performed by the Laemmli procedure (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar) in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was a characterization of Ca2+transport by the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase from pig brain in terms of countertransport and electrogenic properties. The study of ion fluxes was rendered possible by the use of PMCA reconstituted in proteoliposomes with a low electrolyte permeability. The reconstituted synaptosomal PMCA sustains a Ca2+ transport rate up to 0.4 μmol of Ca2+/mg of protein·min−1, similar to those obtained by Niggli et al. (13Niggli V. Sigel E. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2350-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Hao et al. (12Hao L. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14268-14275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with reconstituted erythrocyte PMCA. In addition, the low lipid/protein ratio used for reconstitution has provided a large lumenal volume per ATPase molecule, thereby permitting accumulation of large amounts of Ca2+ and relatively long experimental times before establishment of an inhibitory Ca2+concentration in the lumen of the proteoliposomes. The 1/1 stoichiometric ratio of Ca2+ uptake and ATP hydrolysis obtained by measurements of initial rates (Table I) is in the same range as that reported with the reconstituted erythrocyte PMCA (12Hao L. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14268-14275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Niggli V. Sigel E. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2350-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but lower than the ratio of 2/1 obtained with SERCA (9Yu X. Carrol S. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1232-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This difference may be related to intrinsic characteristics of the two families of Ca2+ pumps (23Inesi G. Kirtley M.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 271-283PubMed Google Scholar, 24Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 1993; 14: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Carafoli E. Guerini Sotelo J.R. Benech J.C. Calcium Cell Metabolism. Transport and Regulation. Plenum Press, NY1997: 73-84Google Scholar).The use of the proteoliposomal reconstituted system turned out to be very advantageous in demonstrating that the synaptosomal PMCA pump operates Ca2+/H+ countertransport. Collapse of the related H+ gradient by the H+ ionophore FCCP, and not by the K+ ionophore valinomycin, is consistent with direct Ca2+/H+ countertransport through the pump, rather than H+ extrusion secondary to electrical potential. The Ca2+/H+stoichiometric ratio of 0.6 found in the synaptosomal plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, is similar to the ratios reported for the other Ca2+-ATPases. For example, Hao et al. (12Hao L. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14268-14275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) obtained a stoichiometric Ca2+/H+ ratio of 1 with the reconstituted erythrocyte PMCA at 12 °C temperature but a lower ratio at 30 °C. Although the Ca2+/H+ratio may be primarily determined by the stoichiometry and pKs of acidic residues operating the Ca2+/H+ exchange (18Yu X. Hao L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16656-16661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that higher temperatures and/or other experimental variable may produce H+ slippage (26Yu X. Inesi G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The uneven charge exchange produced by the observed Ca2+/H+ratios is consistent with the development of transmembrane electrical potential following addition of ATP (Fig. 5).The Ca2+/H+ countertransport and the net charge transfer demonstrated with purified and reconstituted brain PMCA will be useful in understanding Ca2+ regulation in synaptosomal function. Furthermore, demonstration of Ca2+/H+countertransport in several Ca2+ transport ATPases indicates that a shift in the affinity of protein carboxylic functions for H+and Ca2+ occurs upon formation and cleavage of phosphorylated enzyme intermediate and that this is a common mechanistic feature in the coupling of ATP utilization and Ca2+ transport. Regulation of the intracellular free Ca2+concentration in nerve terminals is a key factor in the mechanism of synaptic transmission (1Gill D.L. Grollman E.F. Khon L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 184-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sorensen R.G. Mahler H.R. J. Neurochem. 1981; 37: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).

The main advantages of this procedure were: (i) optimal protein incorporation and orientation, (ii) very low permeability of the proteoliposomal membrane to electrolytes, and (iii) large intravesicular volume which delays back inhibition by high concentrations of lumenal Ca2+ (8Levy D. Seigneuret A. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19524-19534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then studied the functional properties of the reconstituted synaptosomal PMCA, measuring ATP-dependent Ca2+-uptake activity, H+ ejection, and formations of transmembrane electrical potential. MATERIALS AND METHODSEgg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) and egg phosphatidic acid (EPA) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. Calmodulin, calmodulin-agarose, C12E8, FCCP, valinomycin and A23187 were obtained from Sigma. Oxonol VI and 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrene trisulfonate (pyranine) were from Molecular Probes. Bio-Beads SM-2 and the anion exchange chromatography resin AG1X8 were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of the highest purity available.Purification of Plasma Membrane Ca2+-ATPaseThe pig brain plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase was purified as described in Salvador and Mata (5Salvador J.M. Mata A.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh pig brain was homogenized in 10 volumes of 10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 0.32m sucrose, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol. After two centrifugations at low and high speed, respectively, the pellet was layered in a discontinuous 20–40% (w/v) sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 63,000 × g. The synaptosomes obtained in the interface were lysed in a hypotonic medium containing 1 mm EDTA and centrifugated at 20,000 ×g. The synaptic plasma membrane vesicles were obtained in the pellet and solubilized in a medium containing 20 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 130 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm CaCl2, 15% glycerol, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.6% (w/v) Triton X-100. The solubilized fraction was applied onto a calmodulin-agarose column previously equilibrated with the same buffer except that 1 mm MgCl2 and 100 μmCaCl2 was used. Finally the Ca2+-ATPase was eluted in the above buffer containing 0.06% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 2 mm EDTA instead of calcium. The samples were stored at −80°C until use.Preparation of Liposomes and Reconstitution of the Ca2+-ATPaseEPC/EPA (9/1, w/w) liposomes were prepared by reverse phase evaporation as described previously (19Rigaud J.L. Bluzat A. Bluschlen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 20 mm Pipes-K+, pH 7.1, 130 mm KCl (Pipes buffer, pH 7.1). After sequential extrusion through 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 μm nucleopore filters, the liposomes were resuspended at 4 mg/ml in Pipes buffer, pH 7.1, and solubilized by 8 mg/ml C12 E8. The purified Ca2+-ATPase (0.11 mg/ml) was added to the liposomes at a lipid/protein ratio of 150/1 (w/w) and incubated for 2 min. The detergent was then removed in 3 h by subsequent additions of Bio-Beads SM-2 (80 mg/ml/h) under continuous stirring. After complete detergent removal, the proteoliposomes were pipetted off. When measurements of H+ ejection were done, the fluorescent pH indicator pyranine (200 μm) was added in the incubation medium before Bio-Beads addition. After detergent removal, the external pyranine was removed by passing the proteoliposomes through an anion exchange chromatography column (AG1X8).Ca2+-ATPase ActivityThe enzymatic activity was measured at 25 °C by using a coupled enzyme assay following spectrophotometrically the NADH absorption change at 340 nm. The proteoliposomal protein (3 μg/ml) was incubated in 2 ml of a medium containing Pipes buffer, pH 7.1 plus 5 mmMgCl2, 10 μm CaCl2, 0.22 mm NADH, 0.42 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units of pyruvate kinase, and 28 units of lactate dehydrogenase. Additions of 0.2 mm ATP or 1 mm ATP were done to assay the activity of the reconstituted or solubilized protein, respectively.Ca2+ UptakeCa2+uptake by reconstituted proteoliposomes was measured by following the differential absorption of the metallochromic indicator arsenazo III (50 μm) as described previously (20Scarpa A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 301-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A 687–660-nm wavelength pair was used in a dual wavelength spectrophotometer (DW-2000, SLM-Aminco) to monitor changes in external Ca2+concentration. The proteoliposomal protein (6 μg) was incubated at 25 °C in 2 ml of a medium containing Pipes buffer, pH 7.1, plus 0.42 μg/ml calmodulin, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm arsenazo III. The absorbance signal uptake was calibrated by the addition of 10 μm final Ca2+, and the reaction was initiated by adding 0.2 mm ATP.ATP-dependent H+ EjectionLumenal H+ ejection of the proteoliposomes was measured by following the changes in the fluorescence intensity of the pH indicator pyranine that is entrapped during the reconstitution procedure (9Yu X. Carrol S. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1232-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity was measured using a λexc 460 nm and λem 510 nm in a spectrofluorometer (Jasco FP-777). Calibration of lumenal pH changes was done by subsequent additions of 0.5 mn H2SO4 to 2 ml of medium containing 6 μg of proteoliposomal protein in Pipes buffer, pH 7.1, plus 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μmCaCl2, and 4 μm FCCP.The stoichiometry of lumenal H+ was done by taking into account the lumenal volume, as described in Levy et al., 1992 (17Levy D. Gulik A. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The internal volume of the proteoliposomes (400 μl/mg of protein) was taken from Hao et al. (12Hao L. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14268-14275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Electrical Potential AssayThe transmembrane electrical potential was measured by following the differential absorption (625–603 nm) of 2 μm oxonol VI, using dual wavelength spectrophotometry (12Hao L. Rigaud J.L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14268-14275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was as described for Ca2+ uptake except that oxonol VI was used instead of arsenazo III. The calibration was done by several additions of 130 mm KCl to the medium in the presence of 1 μmof the K+ ionophore valinomycin and in the absence of ATP. Absorption changes were standardized with electrical potential by using the Nernst equation.Protein DeterminationThe protein content was measured by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213347) Google Scholar). The interference of Triton X-100 was avoided by a previous treatment of the samples with Bio-Beads SM-2.SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisElectrophoresis was performed by the Laemmli procedure (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar) in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) and egg phosphatidic acid (EPA) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. Calmodulin, calmodulin-agarose, C12E8, FCCP, valinomycin and A23187 were obtained from Sigma. Oxonol VI and 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrene trisulfonate (pyranine) were from Molecular Probes. Bio-Beads SM-2 and the anion exchange chromatography resin AG1X8 were purchased from Bio-Rad.

https://openalex.org/W2066901336,"Two new potential ligands of theDrosophila PS2 integrins have been characterized by functional interaction in cell culture. These potential ligands are a new Drosophila laminin α2 chain encoded by the wing blister locus and Ten-m, an extracellular protein known to be involved in embryonic pattern formation. As with previously identified PS2 ligands, both contain RGD sequences, and RGD-containing fragments of these two proteins (DLAM-RGD and TENM-RGD) can support PS2 integrin-mediated cell spreading. In all cases, this spreading is inhibited specifically by short RGD-containing peptides. As previously found for the PS2 ligand tiggrin (and the tiggrin fragment TIG-RGD), TENM-RGD induces maximal spreading of cells expressing integrin containing the αPS2C splice variant. This is in contrast to DLAM-RGD, which is the first Drosophila polypeptide shown to interact preferentially with cells expressing the αPS2 m8 splice variant. The βPS integrin subunit also varies in the presumed ligand binding region as a result of alternative splicing. For TIG-RGD and TENM-RGD, the β splice variant has little effect, but for DLAM-RGD, maximal cell spreading is supported only by the βPS4A form of the protein. Thus, the diversity in PS2 integrins due to splicing variations, in combination with diversity of matrix ligands, can greatly enhance the functional complexity of PS2-ligand interactions in the developing animal. The data also suggest that the splice variants may alter regions of the subunits that are directly involved in ligand interactions, and this is discussed with respect to models of integrin structure.

The integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins, consisting of α and β subunits, that serve as receptors for extracellular matrix molecules and cell surface molecules of neighboring cells. Integrins have roles in diverse phenomena, such as cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and differentiation, as well as roles in the development and progression of numerous pathological states, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8940) Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Lander A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 303-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 3Varner J.A.

As might be expected from these varied requirements, integrins not only provide mechanical linkages to the matrix and neighboring cells but also receive and transmit information from the cell exterior to the cell interior, and vice versa (5Dedhar S. Hannigan G.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, provides a valuable genetic system in which to examine these integrin functions in the developing animal (6Brown N.H. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Gotwals P.J. Paine-Saunders S.E. Stark K.A. Hynes R.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As a complement to these genetic studies, we have utilized cultured cells, expressing various combinations of Drosophila PS integrin transgenes, to examine interactions of PS integrins and potential integrin ligands. The PS1, PS2, and PS3 integrins of Drosophila consist of a common βPS subunit paired with an αPS1, αPS2, or αPS3 subunit, respectively. βPS, αPS1, and αPS2 were originally identified as position-specific (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, position-specific; C, canonical; m8, missing exon 8; S2, Schneider's line 2; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. 1The abbreviations used are: PS, position-specific; C, canonical; m8, missing exon 8; S2, Schneider's line 2; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. antigens in monoclonal antibody screens of imaginal discs (8Wilcox M.

A. 1984; 81: 7485-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Subsequent biochemical and molecular analyses of these antigens indicated that they are members of the integrin family (10Leptin M. Aebersold R. Wilcox M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Bogaert T. Brown N. Wilcox M.

Dev. 1993; 43: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). αPS3 was identified only recently, and little is known of its ligand binding properties (14Stark K.A. Yee G.H. Roote C.E. Williams E.L. Zusman S. Hynes R.O. Development. 1997; 124: 4583-4594PubMed Google Scholar). Both the βPS and αPS2 subunits may be alternatively spliced to generate proteins that vary in their extracellular domains. The βPS subunit mRNA has been found in alternatively spliced forms to generate proteins referred to as βPS4A and βPS4B (15Yee G. Identification and Characterization of Integrin Receptor Subunits in Drosophila melanogaster.Ph.D. thesis. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1993Google Scholar, 16Zusman S. Grinblat Y. Yee G. Kafatos F.C. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 118: 737-750PubMed Google Scholar). These subunits differ in the utilization of different fourth exons, which encode 29 amino acids in the ligand binding “head” of the β subunit. The αPS2 subunit exists in splice forms called αPS2C and αPS2m8 (17Brown N.H. King D.L. Wilcox M. Kafatos F.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), referring to the presence (C, canonical) or absence (m8, missing exon 8) of exon 8. When present, the eighth exon encodes 25 amino acids, potentially located in a region that would be expected to influence ligand associations. Thus, there are at least four possible α/β heterodimer combinations for PS2 integrins: αPS2CβPS4A, αPS2CβPS4B, αPS2m8βPS4A, and αPS2m8βPS4B. These receptors may generate significant PS2 integrin functional diversity during development. Ligands that support Drosophila PS2 integrin-mediated cell spreading include mammalian vitronectin and fibronectin (18Bunch T.A. Brower D.L. Development. 1992; 116: 239-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zavortink M. Bunch T.A. Brower D.L. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1993; 1: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the novel Drosophila extracellular matrix protein, tiggrin (20Fogerty F.J. Fessler L.I. Bunch T.A. Yaron Y. Parker C.G. Nelson R.E. Brower D.L. Gullberg D. Fessler J.H. Development. 1994; 120: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key feature of several vertebrate integrin ligands is the tripeptide sequence, Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). This same tripeptide is apparently recognized by Drosophila PS2 integrins, as all previously identified PS2 ligands contain an RGD sequence, and PS2 integrin-mediated cell spreading is inhibited by soluble RGD peptides. Moreover, tiggrin polypeptides in which the RGD sequence has been changed to LGA no longer support cell spreading, and the RGD sequence is required for maximal rescue by transgenes of some tiggrinmutant phenotypes in situ (21Bunch T.A. Graner M.W. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Schneider K.D. Kerschen A. Choy L.P. Burgess B.W. Brower D.L. Development. 1998; 125: 1679-1689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PS1-expressing cells have been shown to spread on Drosophila heterotrimeric laminin, which does not contain an RGD motif (22Gotwals P.J. Fessler L.I. Wehrli M. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11447-11451Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and this spreading is not inhibited by RGD peptides. 2T. Bunch, unpublished observations. 2T. Bunch, unpublished observations. One approach for identifying additional PS2 ligands is to first search for candidate extracellular matrix molecules based on structure (e.g. an RGD sequence) or location (e.g. muscle attachment sites) and ask whether the purified proteins or protein fragments will support PS2-mediated cell spreading in culture. One such candidate is Ten-m (23Baumgartner S. Martin D. Hagios C. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), a protein with tenascin-type EGF repeats (Fig. 1). Ten-m contains a C-terminal RGD sequence, and earlier studies had suggested that it may function as a PS2 ligand. 3S. Baumgartner, unpublished observations. 3S. Baumgartner, unpublished observations. Mutants for theten-m gene display an early embryonic patterning defect of the “pair-rule” type (23Baumgartner S. Martin D. Hagios C. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Levine A. Bashan-Ahrend A. Budal-Hadrian O. Gartenberg D. Menasherow S. Wides R. Cell. 1994; 77: 587-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Another potential PS2 ligand is encoded by the wing blister locus, mutations in which can lead to wing blisters similar to those caused by loss-of-function integrin mutations (25Woodruff R.C. Ashburner M. Genetics. 1979; 92: 133-149PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, this gene was found to encode a new laminin α chain, D-laminin α2, which, in contrast to the previously characterized Drosophila laminin α chain (26Kusche-Gullberg M. Garrison K.

Chiquet-Ehrismann, and S. Baumgartner, manuscript in preparation. 4D. Martin, S. Zusman, X. Li, E. Williams, R. Chiquet-Ehrismann, and S. Baumgartner, manuscript in preparation. We have examined the ability of tiggrin and these newly characterized matrix components to support PS2-mediated cell spreading, utilizing S2 cell lines that express each of the different PS2 integrin α/β heterodimer combinations. Our results demonstrate that peptides from both Ten-m and D-laminin α2 can serve as integrin ligands in our in vitro assays. Moreover, we find that both α and β splice variants lead to ligand-dependent differences in integrin function. Cell culture techniques and methods for transfection of cells have been previously described, as have Schneider's line 2 (S2)Drosophila cells that have been stably transfected with integrin transgenes under the regulation of the heat shock protein 70 promoter (18Bunch T.A. Brower D.L. Development. 1992; 116: 239-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zavortink M. Bunch T.A. Brower D.L. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1993; 1: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The construct used to express the βPS4B subunit, also under the regulation of the heat shock protein 70 promoter, is described in Ref. 16Zusman S. Grinblat Y. Yee G. Kafatos F.C. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 118: 737-750PubMed Google Scholar. Cell spreading assays were performed as described previously (19Zavortink M. Bunch T.A. Brower D.L. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1993; 1: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Fogerty F.J. Fessler L.I. Bunch T.A. Yaron Y. Parker C.G. Nelson R.E. Brower D.L. Gullberg D. Fessler J.H. Development. 1994; 120: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with dispase/collagenase to remove existing matrix molecules and cell surface proteins. Cells were then heat shocked at 37 °C for 30 min to induce expression of integrin transgenes and were then plated on TIG-RGD, DLAM-RGD, or TENM-RGD substrates (described below). 4–6 h following the heat shock, the cells were fixed and quantified by scoring for spread cells using a Nikon phase-contrast microscope (Nikon Diaphot-TMD). Three fields of cells were counted for each well, and the numbers reported represent the averages (and standard errors) of three separate experiments. TIG-RGD was a generous gift from Frances Fogerty and has been described (20Fogerty F.J. Fessler L.I. Bunch T.A. Yaron Y. Parker C.G. Nelson R.E. Brower D.L. Gullberg D. Fessler J.H. Development. 1994; 120: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a polyhistidine-tagged bacterial fusion protein that contains 270 amino acids of tiggrin, residues 1891–2161, with the RGD sequence being residues 1989–1991 (tiggrin has a total of 2186 amino acids). TENM-RGD is a bacterial fusion protein that contains a polyhistidine tag fused to the final 212 amino acids of Ten-m. Ten-m has a total of 2515 amino acids (23Baumgartner S. Martin D. Hagios C. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the RGD sequence is 72 amino acids from the C terminus. This fusion protein was produced from the expression vector pTrcHisB (Xpress SystemTM, Invitrogen), into which was cloned an XhoI-HindIII fragment of theten-m cDNA. His-tagged DLAM-RGD was made by cloning a polymerase chain reaction product into pTrcHisA. Genomic DNA from Oregon-R flies was used as template, and sequencing of the wing blister gene showed that there are no introns in this interval.4 The recombinant protein contains 340 amino acids of D-laminin α2. These are residues 492–832 (RGD is found at 689–691) of a total of 3325 residues. Protein induction was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols, and recombinant peptide was affinity purified using a nickel resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen). Purified fusion proteins were dialyzed from a buffer containing 8 m urea stepwise into 50 mmTris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and comparison of fusion protein staining with that of protein molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Total protein concentrations were determined by using a BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cells were prepared for flow cytometry following essentially the same procedure as for cell spreading; briefly, cells were protease-treated, heat-shocked, and allowed to recover for 3 h. Cells were then incubated with an anti-PS2 monoclonal antibody (CF.2C7), followed by staining with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were then fixed in 3% formaldehyde. FACS analyses were performed at the Research Flow Cytometry Service Laboratory of the University of Arizona Cancer Center. Data were acquired with a FACScan device (Becton Dickinson), and data were analyzed using FACSvantage and Cell Quest software. The alternative splicing to produce extracellular variants in αPS2 and βPS have been described previously (15Yee G. Identification and Characterization of Integrin Receptor Subunits in Drosophila melanogaster.Ph.D. thesis. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1993Google Scholar, 16Zusman S. Grinblat Y. Yee G.

Cell. 1989; 59: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, models for the structure of the ligand binding heads of both α and β integrin subunits have been proposed, and the positions of the variant residues with respect to these models are detailed under “Discussion.” Fogerty et al. (20Fogerty F.J. Fessler L.I. Bunch T.A. Yaron Y. Parker C.G. Nelson R.E. Brower D.L. Gullberg D. Fessler J.H. Development. 1994; 120: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the novel Drosophila extracellular matrix protein tiggrin serves as a ligand in PS2 integrin-mediated cell spreading assays. A 270-amino acid C-terminal recombinant fragment containing the RGD sequence of tiggrin (here referred to as TIG-RGD) (Fig. 1) also promoted cell spreading. The β subunit of the integrin receptors used in those assays was βPS4A. We extended the analyses of cell spreading on TIG-RGD to include integrin heterodimers composed of αPS2βPS4B. As was seen previously (20Fogerty F.J. Fessler L.I. Bunch T.A. Yaron Y. Parker C.G. Nelson R.E. Brower D.L. Gullberg D. Fessler J.H. Development. 1994; 120: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PS2C cells spread better on TIG-RGD than PS2 m8 cells (Fig. 2). Additionally, we found that PS2 integrin-expressing cell lines spread equally well on TIG-RGD regardless of the β subunit splice variant of the integrin. All of the cell spreading on TIG-RGD was inhibited by soluble RGD peptides (Fig. 3).Figure 3Inhibition of cell spreading by RGD peptides. Cell spreading was performed as before in the presence of increasing concentrations of the peptides GRGDSP and GRGESP. For simplicity, data are presented only for three cell lines (CA, CB, and m8A), representing various combinations of splice variants and ligands; all cell spreading by PS2 integrins reported here is similarly inhibited by GRGDSP. Abbreviations are as for Fig. 2. Ligands illustrated here are as follows: CA, 3 μg/ml TIG-RGD;CB, 10 μg/ml TENM-RGD; m8A, 5 μg/ml DLAM-RGD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We generated a recombinant protein fragment of 212 amino acids of Ten-m, including the RGD sequence, and used this fragment (TENM-RGD) as a substrate for cell spreading assays. As shown in Fig. 4, TENM-RGD supported cell spreading for all tested PS2 integrin-expressing cell lines. Reminiscent of PS2-mediated cell spreading on TIG-RGD, PS2C cells spread better on TENM-RGD than did PS2m8 cells. Additionally, the alternative splice forms of the βPS subunit made little or no difference in the levels of cell spreading on TENM-RGD. As with TIG-RGD, this cell spreading was inhibited by soluble RGD peptides (Fig. 3). Analysis of the predicted coding sequence of D-laminin α2 indicates that this protein is a member of the laminin α chain family of extracellular matrix molecules,4 and the putative protein domain structure may be grouped according to accepted laminin nomenclature (Fig. 1). Overall, the sequence of D-laminin α2 is similar to murine laminin α2 chains, and it contains 19 laminin EGF-like repeats, 5 laminin G domains, a laminin B motif, and a characteristic laminin N-terminal domain. D-laminin α2 also possesses a potential integrin-binding RGD sequence in the N-terminal quarter of the protein, in the IVb region between two blocks of EGF-like domains. We generated a recombinant protein fragment that includes theD-laminin α2 RGD sequence (DLAM-RGD), and this 342-amino acid fragment was purified and plated on microtiter plates to be used as a ligand in integrin-mediated cell spreading assays. All PS2 integrin-expressing cells spread on D-laminin α2, in contrast to the parental S2 cell line (Fig. 5). However, αPS2m8βPS4A cells spread 2–3 times better on D-laminin α2 than all other PS2 integrin-expressing cells, including αPS2m8βPS4B cells. This was in contrast to PS2-mediated cell spreading on TIG-RGD and on TENM-RGD, where PS2C cells always spread better than PS2 m8 cells, and the β subunit splice variant made little difference. Again, spreading on DLAM-RGD was inhibited by RGD peptides (Fig. 3). Although it is formally possible that the differences in spreading observed between different cell lines are due to differences in integrin expression levels, this does not appear to be the case. Both FACS analysis (Fig. 6) and immunofluorescence (see, for example, Ref. 18Bunch T.A. Brower D.L. Development. 1992; 116: 239-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that surface integrin expression on the cells was heterogeneous, but the large majority (typically 85% or more) of the induced cells expressed significant integrin for all of the lines. Most importantly, there was no obvious correlation between expression levels and spreading. For example, among the four transfected cell lines, the αPS2CβPS4A-expressing and αPS2CβPS4B-expressing cells exhibited the highest and lowest levels of surface integrin (displaying a difference of 2-fold or more in mean and median fluorescence values in two FACS experiments), but showed virtually identical, and very reproducible, levels of spreading on two peptide ligands. In general, it appears that once a relatively low level of surface integrin is present, further increases do not result in large changes in spreading behavior. Indeed, even uninduced cells (but not untransfected S2 cells), which contain very small amounts of integrin relative to heat shock-induced cells (see, for example, Fig. 1 of Ref. 18Bunch T.A. Brower D.L. Development. 1992; 116: 239-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), will spread in culture if a suitable matrix is present. Using structural homology arguments, Springer (30Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) has generated a model to describe the organization of the integrin α subunit globular head. According to this model, seven repeat domains (termed FG-GAP repeats for the phenylalanyl-glycl and glycyl-alanyl-prolyl consensus sequences) are folded into a cyclic β-propeller, and each “blade” of the β-propeller is postulated to be composed of four strands of anti-parallel β sheet. For αPS2, sequence alignments place the residues encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 8 in the loop connecting β sheet strands two and three of the third propeller blade (Fig. 7). Recently, mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that residues in the corresponding loops of αIIb, α4, and α5 are critical for ligand binding (33Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Kamata T. Irie A. Tokuhira M. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18610-18615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Irie A. Kamata T. Takada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7198-7203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and one possibility is that the extra 25 amino acids extend this loop on the top of the β-propeller, providing a new surface for integrin-ligand interactions. Polypeptides that support good spreading of cells expressing PS2C (vitronectin, tiggrin, and TENM-RGD) also serve as ligands for PS2m8, albeit less well, and so the exon 8-encoded segment probably does not completely replace the normal site of ligand interaction on αPS2m8, but it may provide an additional surface that adds to the stability of binding (17Brown N.H. King D.L. Wilcox M. Kafatos F.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Alternatively, exon 8 could encode a new strand of β sheet that directs the polypeptide chain down to the lower side of the β-propeller, leaving the ligand binding surface relatively intact but adding new residues to potential regulatory sites. For example, alternative splicing of the α7 subunit alters residues in the same part of the protein as does the αPS2 alternative splicing, and the α7 isoforms have been shown recently to affect the activity state of the α7β1integrin (36Ziober B.L. Chen Y. Kramer R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1723-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this vein, it is noteworthy that PS2m8 and PS2C can display different cation requirements in cell spreading experiments (19Zavortink M. Bunch T.A. Brower D.L. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1993; 1: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In an attempt at gaining further insights into these possibilities, we have used a number of different algorithms to predict potential secondary structures in this region of αPS2. Unfortunately, no consistent pattern was seen in the predictions for the residues encoded by exon 8; of particular relevance to the above discussion, residues at the beginning of exon 8 show β sheet potential in some predictive paradigms but not in others. Overall, there is no consistent pattern that would allow one to prefer one structural model over the other. In any case, the residues encoded by exon 8 are likely to be involved in specific protein interactions, since they are highly conserved in the distantly related dipteranCeratitis capitata (17Brown N.H. King D.L. Wilcox M. Kafatos F.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). An overall similarity in hydropathy profiles suggested that the ligand binding domain of β subunits would fold into a structure similar to the I domains of some α subunits, with a cation-containing pocket that is expected to be directly involved in ligand association (37Lee J. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Recently, models for β subunit I domain-like structures have been proposed, and these models differ significantly in the predicted tertiary structure for the region encoded by βPS exon 4. (A comparison of the sequences encoded by the alternatively spliced forms of βPS exon 4 (15Yee G. Identification and Characterization of Integrin Receptor Subunits in Drosophila melanogaster.Ph.D. thesis. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1993Google Scholar, 16Zusman S. Grinblat Y. Yee G. Kafatos F.C. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 118: 737-750PubMed Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 7.) In models that are driven primarily by secondary structure predictions from computer algorithms (Refs. 38Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and 39Takagi J. Kamata T. Meredith J. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14236-14243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar for a non-I domain interpretation of secondary structure profiles), exon 4 encodes residues that form a loop on the top of the β I domain and then run via a β sheet to the lower part of the domain, including the beginning of a motif postulated to be important in integrin regulation (41Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another model makes adjustments to the secondary structure predictions in order to more closely copy the structure of α subunit I domains (42Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21978-21984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). According to this model, the exon 4-encoded domain begins low in the structure, and then, via an α helix and loop structure, moves across the top of the I domain, near the putative ligand binding region. Thus, in either model exon 4-encoded residues might be expected to interact directly with ligand, but they are likely to be different residues in the respective models. It is intriguing that the exon 4 residues include and connect domains that have been postulated to interact with ligand and mediate integrin regulation, based on mutagenesis and antibody binding studies (39Takagi J. Kamata T. Meredith J. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19794-19800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 41Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region of βPS should prove to be a fruitful location for more extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies. Ten-m possesses some, but not all, of the features common to most vertebrate tenascins (reviewed"

We have measured the maximal transcriptional activation potentials of nuclear factor I (NFI) proteins encoded by each of the four identified NFI genes (NFI-A, -B, -C, and -X) by transient transfection in JEG-3 cells using two model NFI-dependent promoters: 1) a simple chimeric promoter containing a single NFI-binding site upstream of the adenovirus major late promoter (NFI-Ad), and 2) the more complex mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat promoter. The relative activation potentials for the NFI isoforms differed between the two promoters, with NFI-X being the strongest activator of NFI-Ad and NFI-B being the strongest activator of the MMTV promoter. To determine if these promoter-specific differences in activation potential were due to the presence of glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), we added GREs upstream of the NFI-binding site in NFI-Ad. NFI-X remains the strongest activator of the GRE containing simple promoter, indicating that differences in relative activation potential are not due solely to the presence of GREs. Since NFI proteins bind to DNA as dimers, we assessed the activation potentials of NFI heterodimers. Here, we show that NFI heterodimers have intermediate activation potentials compared with homodimers, demonstrating one potential mechanism by which different NFI proteins can regulate gene expression.

The expression of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes is mediated by a complex set of DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. General transcription factors directly interact with the RNA polymerase holoenzyme to form a transcription-competent complex which is capable of a basal level of transcription (see Refs. 1Sawadogo M. Sentenac A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 711-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar and 2Kunzler M. Springer C. Braus G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 19: 117-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, for reviews). Efficient gene transcription occurs when promoter-specific regulatory proteins (transcriptional activators and repressors) bind to DNA sequences in promoters and enhancers and interact directly, or via adapter proteins, with components of the basal machinery (Refs. 3Dynlacht B.D.

Transcriptional activators are modular in nature containing separable and functionally distinct DNA binding and activation domains (Refs. 9Mitchell P.J. Tjian R.

Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, for review). Activation domains have been grouped into three classes depending on their amino acid composition: acidic, glutamine-rich, or proline-rich (9Mitchell P.J. Tjian R.

Mermod N. Andrews P. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). NFI was initially identified as a host-encoded protein required for the efficient initiation of adenovirus (Ad) replication in vitro(14Nagata K. Guggenheimer R. Enomoto T. Lichy J. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6438-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and was later shown to be required for the correct expression of numerous cellular and viral genes.

NFI proteins contain a highly conserved NH2-terminal 220 amino acid region, which mediates DNA binding, dimerization, and the initiation of Ad replication (18Mermod N. O'Neill E. Kelly T. Tjian R.

NFI proteins bind to DNA as both homo- and heterodimers and recognize the consensus binding site, TTGGC(N5)GCCAA with the same apparent affinity (21Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R. Mol. Cell.

However, considerable variation occurs within the COOH-terminal domains of the NFI proteins which likely encode distinct transcription modulation domains. Additional variation between NFI proteins is generated through differential splicing of transcripts from each of the four genes (23Kruse U. Sippel A. J. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), argues in favor of diverse transcription modulation properties for NFI proteins. Different NFI-C isoforms isolated from HeLa cells and porcine liver have different transcriptional activation potentials (13Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 15Paonessa G. Gounari F. Frank R. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3115-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of NFI-mediated activation is unknown, however, direct interactions between one NFI-C protein (CTF1) and components of the basal transcriptional machinery have been reported (31Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3901-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This interaction was shown to be dependent on a sequence motif related to the COOH-terminal heptapeptide repeat (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. However, this is unlikely to be the only mechanism by which NFI proteins activate transcription as some NFI proteins lacking a CTD repeat are potent activators in both yeast (34Wenzelides S. Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2416-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 35Wendler W. Altmann H. Ludwig-Winnacker E.

Although it is widely accepted that NFI proteins function as transcription modulators, it is not clear if they exhibit promoter-specific differences in activation potential. To address this question, and to better understand the transcription modulation properties of NFI proteins, we performed transient transfection experiments using two model NFI-dependent reporter constructs. Here, we demonstrate that NFI isoforms representing each of the 4 murine NFI genes exhibit a broad range of transactivation potentials. Our data also show that activation potentials are modulated in a promoter-specific manner, determined by the COOH-terminal regions of the NFI proteins. The reporter plasmids, pNFIβ-gal and pΔNFIβ-gal, are derivatives of the pB series of vectors which were described previously (37Knox J.J. Rebstein P.J. Manoukian A. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2946-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of pB and pBFB was removed by digestion withBalI and repair of the ends with Klenow polymerase. The bacterial β-galactosidase gene (β-gal) was isolated by digesting pCMVβ-gal (Stratagene) with NotI and repair of the overhanging ends with Klenow polymerase. The blunted NotI β-gal fragment was cloned into pB and pBFB creating pΔNFIβ-gal and pNFIβ-gal, respectively. Orientation was verified by restriction enzyme digestion. pNFIβ-gal differs from pΔNFIβ-gal by presence of a single NFI-binding site cloned immediately upstream of the Ad major late promoter (−51 to +33) promoter element. Reporter plasmid pNFIGREβ-gal was generated by cloning the synthetic oligonucleotide (CTAGTGTACAGGATGTTCTGCGGCCGCTGTACAGGATGTTCTCTAG) which consists of 4 GRE half-sites (in bold) into theXbaI site of pNFIβ-gal. pMMTVβ-gal was created by cloning the HindIII/BamHI fragment of pMAMNeoβ-gal (CLONTECH) intoHindIII/BamHI digested pBSIIKS+ (Stratagene). NFI effector plasmids pCHNFI-B, pCHNFI-C, and pCHNFI-X have been described previously (24Chaudhry A. Lyons G. Gronostajski R. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and express murine proteins homologous to chicken NFI-B2, -C2, and human NFI-X2 (23Kruse U. Sippel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). pCHNFI-A is identical to the NFI-A effector plasmid described previously (24Chaudhry A. Lyons G. Gronostajski R. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) except that it has a 92-nucleotide deletion at residue 473 of the coding sequence, which changes the reading frame and generates a murine protein homologous to chicken NFI-A4 (23Kruse U. Sippel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCHNFI-B-235, which expresses the DNA-binding domain of the murine NFI-B isoform was made by digesting pCHNFI-B with BstXI/BglII, repair with Klenow and religation. Digestion of pCHNFI-C withBstEII/BglII and pCHNFI-X withAflII/BglII followed by repair with Klenow and religation created pCHNFI-C-240 and pCHNFI-X-210, respectively. pCHNFI-B/X was made by digesting pCHNFI-B with Asp-718, repair with Klenow and digestion with NotI, liberating the fragment containing the murine NFI-B DNA-binding region. This fragment was cloned into pCHNFI-X which had been digested with AflII, blunted, and subsequently digested with NotI removing the NFI-X DNA-binding domain. This chimeric construct contains a deletion of a His residue at position 209, which does not affect DNA binding (data not shown). pCHNFI-X/B was created by digesting pCHNFI-X withAflII, repair with Klenow, and digestion withBglII, removing the COOH-terminal region of the murine NFI-X cDNA. The NFI-B COOH-terminal region was isolated as a bluntedXhoI/BglII fragment and cloned into the repairedAflII/BglII digested pCHNFI-X generating pCHNFI-X/B. During cloning, a Leu at position 209 is changed to a Ile, which has no effect on the DNA binding or expression of the NFI-X/B chimeric protein (data not shown). pCHNFI-X-VP16 was created by cloning the blunted BglII/BamHI fragment of CRF-1 (generous gift from Steve Triezenberg) containing the acidic activation carboxyl-terminal domain of the HSV-1 transactivator VP16 into the blunted AflII/BglII fragment of pCHNFI-X. Sequence, orientation, and correct reading frame of all plasmids was verified by automated sequencing (CCF Molecular Biotechnology Core Facility). JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Mediatech) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, 2 × 105cells were plated onto 60-mm dishes and then transfected using calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described (38Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. II. IRL Press, Washington, DC1985Google Scholar). Typically, each coprecipitation consisted of a NFI-dependent β-gal reporter construct (5 μg), SV-40-luciferase (pGL2-Control, Promega) internal control (2.5 μg), and various amounts of the indicated NFI-effector constructs (0.25–5.0 μg). Unless otherwise indicated, 1.0 μg of a hGR expression vector (gift from Ron Evans) was co-transfected with pMMTVβ-gal and pNFIGREβ-gal. Carrier DNA (pBSIIKS+) was added to a total of 15 μg of transfected DNA per plate. Cells were incubated with CaPO4/DNA precipitate for 12–16 h, washed with PBS, and incubated for 24 h in culture media with or without 0.1 μm dexamethasone. Cells were harvested in 300 μl/plate of 1 × Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) with luciferase and β-gal assays performed as described (24Chaudhry A. Lyons G. Gronostajski R. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in quadruplicate using duplicate precipitates for each point, and all results were confirmed by multiple independent experiments using at least two different CsCl purified preparations of plasmid DNA. To prepare JEG-3 whole cell extracts, cell monolayers were washed 2 times with ice-cold PBS and scraped into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. Cells were pelleted by spinning at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 15 min with occasional swirling. Cell debris was pelleted by spinning at 16,000 × g for 10 min, with the supernatant removed and stored at −80 °C. Gel mobility shift analysis was performed using the 32P-labeled FIB 2.6 oligonucleotide or a control mutant oligonucleotide FIB C.2 as described previously (21Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The single point mutation present in FIB C.2 abolishes NFI binding in vitro (39Gronostajski R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5545-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For antibody supershift analysis with the C125A anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (Boehringer Mannheim), binding reactions were carried out for 30 min on ice, followed by the addition of 1 μl of the anti-HA antibody (200 μg/ml) and further incubation for 20 min at room temperature. As a control, binding reactions not incubated with antibody, were treated with 1 μl of PBS and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved as described in Ref. 21Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics model 400 PhosphorImager. To detect the intracellular location of the HA-tagged NFI proteins, HeLa cells were grown on coverslips, transfected with vectors expressing the NFI protein or control vectors, cultured for 48 h, and fixed in chilled methanol at −20 °C for 15 min. Fixed cells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST), incubated with 2–3 μg/ml anti-HA antibody in PBST for 45 min, washed in PBS, incubated for 45 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody, washed in PBS, the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), the cells were examined using a Nikon fluorescence microscope and the images were captured with an Oncor imaging system (Cleveland Clinic Fluorescent Microscopy Core). For control staining, the specific antibody solution was replaced by PBST alone. We have recently reported the cloning of NFI cDNAs from each of the 4 murine NFI genes, analyzed their embryonic and postnatal expression patterns, and demonstrated their ability to activate the glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter in JEG-3 cells (24Chaudhry A. Lyons G. Gronostajski R. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To extend these studies we have used transient transfection assays to determine if the four NFI gene products exhibit promoter-specific differences in activation potential. The NFI effector plasmids and NFI-dependent reporter constructs used in co-transfection experiments are shown in Fig. 1 A. NFI effector plasmids contain the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter/enhancer (40MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) expressing murine proteins homologous to chicken NFI-A4, NFI-B2, NFI-C2, and human NFI-X2 (23Kruse U. Sippel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Each NFI protein contains an NH2-terminal human influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (41Field J. Nikawa J.-I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L.A. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) for ease of detection. The NFI-dependent promoters used are a simple chimeric promoter, pNFIβ-gal and the complex viral pMMTVβ-gal reporter construct. The reporter plasmid pNFIβ-gal is derived from the chimeric pB series of vectors which have been described previously (37Knox J.J. Rebstein P.J. Manoukian A. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2946-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and contains a single NFI-binding site upstream of the adenovirus major late promoter (−51 to +33) driving expression of the bacterial β-gal gene. pMMTVβ-gal contains the glucocorticoid-inducible MMTV promoter driving expression of β-gal. The MMTV promoter has previously been shown to contain an NFI-binding site required for its function (42Miksicek R. Borgmeyer U. Nowock J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,43Bruggemeier U. Rogge L. Winnacker E.L. Beato M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments were carried out in JEG-3 human choriocarcinoma cells, which contain low levels of endogenous NFI proteins and have previously been used to measure activation of the MMTV promoter by porcine NFI-C (43Bruggemeier U. Rogge L. Winnacker E.L. Beato M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To assess the maximal transactivation potential of each of the NFI isoforms, increasing amounts of each effector plasmid were transfected into JEG-3 cells. With both NFI-dependent promoters, increasing amounts of each effector plasmid caused a simple monotonic increase in expression up to apparent saturation, showing no squelching at high levels of effector plasmid (Fig. 1 B, i andii). The maximal level of reporter expression differed for each of the isoforms and was promoter-specific. NFI-X shows the strongest activation of pNFIβ-gal (∼17-fold, Fig. 1 B, panel i), followed by, in decreasing order of activation, NFI-B (∼14-fold), NFI-C (∼9-fold), and NFI-A (∼3-fold). In contrast, NFI-B is the most potent activator of pMMTVβ-gal (Fig. 1 B, panel ii) with maximal activation of ∼13-fold, followed by NFI-X (∼11-fold), NFI-C (∼6-fold), and NFI-A (∼3-fold). The fold activation is shown only in the presence of dexamethasone as MMTV promoter activity in the absence of hormone induction is undetectable (see Fig. 2 B, for example). Differences in activation potential of each NFI isoform are not due to differences in protein level expression as Western blot analysis (data not shown) and gel shift analysis indicate similar NFI protein levels in transfected cells (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3–6, arrow B), which are appropriately super-shifted when incubated with the anti-HA antibody (lanes 8–11, arrow A). NFI-mediated activation of pNFIβ-gal is dependent on the upstream NFI-binding site as pΔNFIβ-gal which lacks an upstream NFI-binding site, is not activated by any of the NFI isoforms (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7–10 versus 6). Interestingly, pNFIβ-gal has an ∼2-fold higher basal activity than pΔNFIβ-gal (Fig. 2 A, lane 1 versus 6), which is likely due to the low levels of endogenous NFI proteins seen in JEG-3 cells (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). As expected, NFI-mediated activation of the MMTV reporter requires co-transfection of a vector expressing the human glucocorticoid receptor (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 versus 12, 4 versus 14, 6 versus 16, 8 versus 18, and 10 versus 20). NFI-mediated activation is dependent on the COOH-terminal domain of the NFI-B, -C, and -X isoforms, as deletion constructs lacking the COOH-terminal domain fail to significantly activate pMMTVβ-gal (Fig. 2 C, lanes 2 versus 6, 8, and 10) or pNFIβ-gal (lanes 11 versus 13–15). These data indicate that the four NFI gene products exhibit promoter-specific differences in their maximal activation potentials. To assess whether the differences in transactivation potential of the NFI isoforms could be due to differences in cellular localization, we examined the intracellular location of the 4 NFI proteins by immunocytochemistry. When stained with monoclonal antibodies directed against the HA epitope tag, cells transfected with vectors expressing any of the 4 HA-tagged NFI proteins exhibited strong nuclear fluorescence (Fig. 3, panels A–D). Mock transfected cells stained with the anti-HA antibodies, or cells stained with secondary antibody alone showed no nuclear fluorescence (Fig. 3, panel E, and data not shown). While the HA-tagged NFI-A protein appeared to stain with a slightly more punctate distribution than the other isoforms (Fig. 3, panel A versus B–D), all 4 proteins were strongly localized to the nucleus. These data agree with our observation that all 4 NFI proteins are found predominantly in nuclear extracts rather than cytosolic extracts when cells are lysed under low salt conditions (not shown). Thus the 4 NFI proteins, while they differ in their transactivation potentials and promoter specificity, show a similar pattern of nuclear localization. Previous studies have demonstrated that the transcription modulation properties of differentially spliced NFI-C and NFI-X isoforms were regulated by their COOH-terminal domains (13Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 44Nebl G. Cato A. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the promoter-specific differences in the activation potential of the NFI-B and NFI-X isoforms were mediated by their COOH-terminal domains, we swapped these regions, creating the chimeric fusion constructs pCHNFI-B/X and pCHNFI-X/B. pCHNFI-B/X expresses the NH2-terminal 208 amino acid DNA-binding domain of NFI-B fused to amino acids 209–401 of NFI-X, while pCHNFI-X/B contains the NH2-terminal 210 amino acids of NFI-X fused to the COOH-terminal amino acids 209–420 of NFI-B. Saturating amounts of the NFI effector plasmids were transfected with each NFI-dependent reporter construct (Fig. 4). Maximal activation of the MMTV reporter is observed with the NFI-B or NFI-X/B effector constructs, with NFI-X and NFI-B/X activating less (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and6 versus 8 and 9). In contrast, the strongest activation of pNFIβ-gal occurs with either NFI-X or NFI-B/X effector plasmids, with reduced levels of activation mediated by NFI-B and NFI-X/B (Fig. 4, lanes 14 and 15 versus 12 and13). These findings demonstrate that the promoter-specific differences in relative activation potential of NFI-B and NFI-X appear to be mediated solely by their COOH-terminal regions. While both reporter constructs used in this study are NFI-dependent, the MMTV promoter is considerably more complex, with its activity also dependent on GREs and other sequence motifs (reviewed in Ref. 45Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). To determine if the promoter-specific differences in relative activation potentials of the NFI-X and NFI-B isoforms were due to the presence of GREs, we compared the activation properties of pNFIβ-gal with those of pNFIGREβ-gal, which was made by addition of two GREs upstream of the NFI-binding site of pNFIβ-gal (Fig. 5 A). In the absence of coexpressed GR, the activity of pNFIGREβ-gal appears identical to that of pNFIβ-gal with NFI-B activating ∼10-fold and NFI-X ∼15-fold (Fig. 5 B, lanes 7–12 versus 1–6, see also Fig. 2 A). The lack of dexamethasone induction here is due to the absence of either GREs (lanes 2, 4, and 6) or GR (lanes 8, 10, and 12). In the absence of dexamethasone, when GR is coexpressed with pNFI-GREβ-gal, the reporter expression is identical to that seen with pNFIβ-gal, with NFI-B and NFI-X activating expression ∼10-fold and ∼15-fold, respectively, (Fig. 5 B, lanes 15 and 17 versus 13). However, a robust dexamethasone-dependent activation occurs when the human glucocorticoid receptor is coexpressed with pNFIGREβ-gal (∼150-fold, lanes 14 versus 13). Dexamethasone-dependent activation is further enhanced when NFI-B is co-transfected (lane 16, ∼260-fold). However, maximum expression of pNFIGREβ-gal is observed when it is co-transfected with the NFI-X effector construct (lane 18, ∼350-fold). Therefore, although the addition of GREs to pNFIβ-gal renders it glucocorticoid responsive, the relative order of activation potentials of the NFI isoforms remains unchanged. These findings suggest that promoter-specific differences in the relative activation potential of NFI-X and NFI-B isoforms are not due solely to the presence of GREs. NFI binds its cognate sequence as a dimer, resulting in two copies of its COOH-terminal activation domain being placed into close proximity with any potential coactivator protein(s).

The term “cytokine” has come to be used for a diverse group of growth factors, inflammatory mediators, and hematopoietic regulators that are distinct from more classical hormones secreted by the glands of the endocrine system. Cytokines are proteins that act as a soluble cell to cell messengers, distinguished by their high interactivity, and can act in both autocrine and paracrine manners. Neoplastic cells themselves characteristically produce cytokines spontaneously, and even in the same lineage, they can have distinct cytokine expression and/or secretion profiles (1Pekarek L.A. Weichselbaum R.R. Beckett M.A. Nachman J. Schreiber H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1978-1981PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kruger-Krasagakes S. Krasagakis K. Garbe C. Diamantstein T. Recent Res.

Yamamoto K. Abe T. Hazama S. Suzuki T. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cytokines secreted by tumors could be used either as autocrine factors, to recruit and suppress reactive leukocytes, or to modulate the activity of endothelial and stromal cells. The ability to release cytokine in an autocrine manner could be a key factor in the promotion of neoplastic transformation and in permitting tumor growth in vivo (5Sporn M.B. Todaro G.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 303: 878-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). In their turn, cytokines produced by the host in response to a tumor modify the scenario created by tumor growth (6Colombo M.P. Modesti A. Parmiani G. Forni G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4853-4857PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of expression of cytokine genes by tumors indicated that cells constitutively produced both autostimulatory and inhibitory cytokines. Expression of several cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; rhTNF, recombinant human TNF; LT, lymphotoxin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; kb, kilobase pair; bp, base pair. IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, lymphotoxin-α, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor by some tumors has been described. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-α (LT-α, also known as TNF-β) are related cytokines involved in many regulatory activities (7Vassalli P. Annu. Rev.

TNF and LT-α are released by a number of tumor cells originating in mouse fibrosarcoma, epithelial human cell lines, and T-cell leukemia (10Rubin B.Y. Anderson S.L. Sullivan S.A. Williamson B.D.

In this study, we used a pair of related mouse transplanted tumors with the opposite metastatic properties to identify genes overexpressed in one of them. As a result, the tag7 gene was cloned. It was expressed in tumor with high metastatic potential, although no correlation with metastatic potential was detected after study of many different tumors. The tag7 gene is preferentially transcribed in normal lymphoid and hematopoietic cells. Tag7 is a secreted protein possessing a significant cytotoxicity realized through apoptosis. VMR-0, VMR-L, CSML-0, and CSML-100 cell lines were established from their respective mammary adenocarcinoma transplanted tumors described in Ref. 13Senin V.M. Ivanov A.M. Afanasyeva A.V. Buntsevich A.M. Vestn. Akad. Med. Nauk USSR. 1984; 5: 85-91Google Scholar. Cell lines saved their ability to produce tumors in syngenetic mice with low (VMR-0 and CSML-0) and high (VMR-L and CSML-100) metastatic potential when injected subcutaneously. Mouse splenocytes, thymocytes, monocytes, and peritoneal macrophages were isolated as described previously (14Klaus G.G.B. Klaus G.G.B. Lymphocytes. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1988: 15-67Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES. Cells were activated with LPS (5 μg/ml) in serum-free medium for different time. VMR-0 cells were transfected with the pM5Gneo tag7construct or mock-transfected using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and clones were selected on G418 resistance and maintained. A fragment of the tag7cDNA was isolated by differential display technique essentially as described by Liang and Pardee (15Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar). T12AC oligonucleotide was used as the anchoring primer, and AATCGGGCTG was used as the arbitrary primer. A fragment of 390 bp was used as a probe for Northern blot hybridization and cDNA library screening (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). cDNA library was prepared on poly(A)+ RNA isolated from VMR-L tumors using ZAP-cDNA Gigapack Cloning kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Positive clones were purified, and the inserts were excised as pBluescript clones using helper phage as described by the manufacturer. Few clones were sequenced using Sequenase Version 2.0 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Applied Biosystems 391 DNA synthesizer). Genomic library was constructed in the λ FIX II vector (Stratagene) and screened according to a standard procedure (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The inserts were subcloned in pGEM7Z vector and partially sequenced as described above. Total RNA from tumors and cell lines was isolated by guanidine thiocyanate procedure, resolved on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and blotted onto Hybond-N as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TheEcoRI/XhoI fragment from the longest cDNA clone was labeled by random priming and used as a probe. To equalize an amount of RNA loaded on each lane, hybridization with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase DNA probe was performed.In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (17Ausubel F.M.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding regions of the mouse tag7 gene, with BamHI and HindIII restriction sites appended to the ends of oligonucleotides. The coding region of the gene was amplified by standard polymerase chain reaction techniques, cut withBamHI and HindIII, and inserted in frame in theBamHI and HindIII sites of the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen). For eucaryotic expression, full-sized tag7cDNA was subcloned in NheI-XhoI sites of pBK-CMV (Stratagene) and EcoRI-BamHI sites of pM5Gneo vectors. Fluorescence in situ hybridization on metaphase mouse chromosomes was performed by Genome Systems, Inc. Escherichia colirecombinant Tag7 protein was expressed in M15[pREP4] (Qiagen) and purified on Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Rabbit antibodies raised against recombinant Tag7 were affinity-purified on a Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column with the immobilized recombinant Tag7, as recommended by the manufacturer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The approximate amount of secreted Tag7 by VMRSX8 clone was determined by immunoblotting. Mouse splenocytes (1.5 × 108 cells) were treated with LPS for 18 h on two 100-mm dishes as described above. After that, Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix (Boehringer Mannheim) and EDTA to final concentration 1 mm were added to conditioned medium. Conditioned medium was concentrated and fractionated on Superdex 75 HR10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl according to the manufacturer's recommendation. For column calibration, bovine milk α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa), bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and chicken egg ovalbumin (45 kDa) (Sigma) were used. Proteins from collected fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to membrane. The membrane was then probed with anti-Tag7 polyclonal antiserum. As a source of the native form of the Tag7 protein, the medium conditioned by the VMR-0 pM5Gneo tag7(VMRSX8)-transfected cells was used. L929 cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium. After that, 100 μl/well of the VMRSX8-conditioned medium or VMR-0-conditioned medium were added. As indicated, recombinant human TNF (rhTNF) (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 10 ng/ml in a volume of 100 μl/well. To determine cell death, CytoTox 96 Assay kit (Promega) was used or cells were stained with trypan blue and the coded samples were counted under the microscope in a blind fashion, with a minimum of 100 cells scored for each group. Neutralization of the cytotoxic effect of the Tag7 protein or rhTNF was performed using affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-Tag7 and polyclonal anti-hTNF (Sigma) antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies were added to the VMRSX8-conditioned medium at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml, and the cytotoxic effect was determined as described above; rabbit IgG in the same concentration was used as a control. DNA fragmentation analysis was performed as described (18Tian Q. Streuli M. Saito H. Schlossman S.F. Anderson P. Cell. 1991; 67: 629-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), with modifications. In brief, 2 × 106 L929 cells were preincubated with actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium and subsequently incubated with the VMRSX8-conditioned medium or rhTNF for 5 h. Cells were harvested and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.8% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After centrifugation, DNA from the supernatant was precipitated at -20 °C by isopropanol in the presence of NaCl. DNA was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and treated with RNase A, and fragments were resolved in 1.8% agarose gel in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris-borate, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). Nuclear extracts were obtained as described in Ref. 19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar, and EMSA was performed according to Refs. 16Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T.

NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (Promega) was used for gel shift assay. A system of two related mouse transplanted tumors with opposite metastatic potentials was used to isolate mRNA molecules specifically expressed in one of them. A fragment of complementary DNA was isolated by the differential display technique from the highly metastatic mouse mammary adenocarcinoma VMR-L as overexpressed mRNA in comparison with the nonmetastatic tumor VMR-0. The fragment gave rise to the 0.7-kb mRNA transcript specific for highly metastatic VMR-L tumor. This gene was designated tag7. A cDNA library was constructed with mRNA from VMR-L tumor in a λZAP II vector, and the fragment was used as a probe to isolate complementary DNA. Most of the cDNA clones were sequenced. Thetag7 cDNA is predicted to encode a protein 182 amino acids long with a molecular mass of 20.2 kDa (Fig. 1). Hydropathy computer analysis suggested the presence of a signal sequence (amino acids 1–21) for translation into endoplasmic reticulum followed by extracellular region (amino acids 22–181). The existence of signal peptide indicates that the protein product may be secreted. Protein data base searches (FASTA program from IntelliGenetics and BLAST from the National Center for Biotechnology Information) revealed no significant similarity between the Tag7 polypeptide and known gene products. To obtain a genomic copy of the tag7 gene, a mouse genomic library was constructed in λFIXII vector and screened, and the genomic structure of tag7 was established. The murinetag7 gene spans 8 kb, consists of three exons, and contains a nonconsensus TATA box (Fig. 1). The mRNA start site was mapped using primer extension (data not shown), revealing two initiation starts separated by four nucleotides 22 bp downstream of the TATA box, probably due to the nonconsensus structure of the latter. Computer analysis of approximately 200 bp of the upstream sequence (Signal Scan) revealed a number of potential binding sites for some known transcription factors, such as Ets-1, NF-κB, Sp-1, and MyoD (Fig. 1). The order of binding sites and the distance from the mRNA start site are very close to the control region of mouse LT-β gene (21Pokholok D.K. Maroulakou I.G. Kuprash D.V. Alimzhanov M.B. Kozlov S.V. Novobratseva T.I. Turetskaya R.L. Green J.E. Nedospasov S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 5′-untranslated end of the mRNA was short, which is also typical for lymphotoxin genes. To determine chromosomal localization of tag7 in mouse genome, metaphase chromosomes were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. A total of 80 metaphase cells were analyzed; 62 exhibited specific labeling. This experiment resulted in the specific labeling of the centromeric region of chromosome 7 (data not shown). Measurements of 10 specifically hybridized chromosomes 7 demonstrated that signal is located at a position that is 9% of the distance from the centromere, an area that corresponds to band 7A3. Northern hybridization was used to estimate the correlation between tag7 mRNA expression and metastatic properties of tumors. However, no correlation was observed upon hybridization with total RNA of CSML-0 and CSML-100 tumors (Fig. 2). Moreover, the expression of thetag7 gene appeared to be specific in this pair for the tumor with a low metastatic capacity, CSML-0. There was also no correlation between the metastatic potential and tag7 mRNA expression in other tested murine tumor cell lines (data not shown). The tag7 mRNA level dramatically altered after the establishment of the tumors as a cell culture (Fig. 2). In an established cell line from VMR-L tumors, the level of tag7transcription dropped down, whereas in the CSML-0 cell line, obtained from corresponding tumors, it appeared to be up-regulated. Thus,tag7 in transplanted tumor is regulated by the host factors. To determine the tissue-specific pattern of tag7transcription, Northern blot analyses and in situhybridization were performed. Northern hybridization of several adult mouse tissues (Fig. 3 A) revealed the highest level of tag7 transcription in the lungs and spleen, a detectable level in brain and thymus, and no mRNA content or just a very low level in the other tissues tested. However, in situ hybridization performed on sections of selected organs allowed us to detect a high level of tag7transcripts in certain areas of brain and intestine (Fig. 3,B–E). Only single, randomly distributed cells were labeled in the thymus. In the lungs, the label was concentrated in the intraalveolar space, where, presumably, alveolar macrophages are located (data not shown). Very characteristic pictures were observed in the brain, where the distribution of tag7-expressing cells was extremely nonrandom. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells were specifically labeled. Similarly, only certain layers of neurons were positive in hippocampus (Fig. 3, B and C). Finally, strong expression of the tag7 gene could be detected among the cells filling the space within the intestinal villus (Fig. 3 D). Considering a similarity in distribution of cis-regulatory elements of the tag7 and LT-β genes, we analyzed tag7expression in some mouse lymphoid cells. Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA isolated from mouse circulating monocytes, thymocytes, splenocytes, and resident peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 4). All cells except for monocytes displayed a constitutively high level of tag7 mRNA. Stimulation with IL-2 or phytohemagglutinin did not lead to a significant increase of the mRNA content in thymocytes and macrophages in the time course studied (data not shown). In mouse splenocytes cultured with LPS, the level of tag7transcription dropped down within the first hours of activation (Fig. 4). After the first 5 h of LPS treatment, the level oftag7 mRNA decreased twice; thereupon, induction took place, but the increase of the mRNA level was relatively low. The highest observed level of tag7 mRNA was observed after 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 4). However, Northern blot analysis of murine B cell lymphoma cell line WEHI-231 and T cell lymphoma LBRM-33 did not reveal any detectable level of tag7 transcripts (data not shown) and furthermore, no tag7 transcripts were detected in the above cell lines stimulated with phorbol ester, LPS, and calcium ionophore for 20 h (data not shown). To study Tag7 expression at the protein level, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the E. coli Tag7 recombinant protein were used for Western blotting analysis of VMR-L and CSML-0 cells (Fig. 5 A). The cells were separated from the cultivation medium and lysed. Proteins from both cellular lysates and cultivation medium were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tag7 antibodies, separated in polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to membrane. Most of the Tag7 protein was detected in conditioned medium of VMR-L cells (Fig. 5 A). A similar pattern of gene expression was observed for another Tag7-expressing cell line, CSML-0 (data not shown). The level of tag7 transcription in CSML-0 cell line was higher than in VMR-L cells (Fig. 2); however, the level of protein synthesis remained low, and we were unable to detect Tag7 protein without immunoprecipitation with antibodies. In freshly isolated mouse splenocytes, tag7 mRNA was present at a rather high level, but Tag7 protein was also detected in these cells only after immunoprecipitation with anti-Tag7 antibodies. Mouse splenocytes (Fig. 5 B) contained a significant amount of cellular Tag7 protein, and LPS stimulation increased its content 5–7-fold with a maximum at about 24 h. Although during the first hours of activation most of Tag7 protein was found in a splenocyte-associated form, a long exposure of cells to LPS resulted not only in increasing the overall amount of the protein but also in its secretion. To determine the quaternary structure of the protein, cultivation medium from LPS-activated mouse splenocytes was concentrated and applied on Superdex 75HR column. Fractions were collected and concentrated, and Western blot analysis with anti-Tag7 antibodies was performed (Fig. 5 C). About half of the total amount of the protein was detected in a 50-kDa fraction; the rest of the protein remained in low molecular weight fractions. This fact allowed us to suggest that secreted native Tag7 protein could also exist as a multimeric complex. Recombinant E. coli Tag7 protein was isolated as a denatured protein from inclusion bodies. All of our attempts to refold the protein after purification on Ni-NTA column failed. During dialysis, the purified from the E. coli system material irreversibly precipitated. To perform functional studies with Tag7 protein, we constructed cell line constitutively producing Tag7. The VMR-0 cell line, which does not express tag7 (Fig. 6 A), was stably transfected with the constructions expressing the tag7 gene. For transfections, both pBK-CMV and pM5Gneo eucaryotic expression vectors were used; however, the pM5Gneo vector allowed us to obtain significantly higher level of Tag7 expression. We analyzed 15 G418-resistant clones on the level of Tag7 expression. In most of them, the level of the exogenous tag7 transcription was relatively high, but Tag7 protein synthesis remained hardly detectable. The clone with the highest level of Tag7 secretion (VMRSX8) (less than 10 ng/ml) was selected for further studies of soluble Tag7 protein. For this, L929 cells were treated with either conditioned supernatant from VMRSX8 cells or from the control mock-transfected VMR-0 cells for different time intervals. It was found that conditioned medium from VMRSX8 cells caused death in target L929 cells. Maximum cytotoxicity was observed at 5 h and did not increase significantly after 24 h incubation (Fig. 6 B). The results obtained demonstrated that both TNF and Tag7 killed L929 cells in the presence of actinomycin D. Addition of anti-Tag7 polyclonal antibodies specifically blocked cell death caused by VMRSX8 supernatant and did not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. At the same time, anti-TNF antibodies did not block Tag7-induced cell death. The supernatant from VMR-0 cells did not possess any cytotoxic activity. Human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7 was also susceptible to Tag7 killing (data not shown). Because the process of apoptosis is known to rapidly induce DNA fragmentation, the ability of the secreted form of Tag7 to trigger apoptosis was examined utilizing a DNA fragmentation assay. Conditioned supernatant of VMRSX8 cells was added to target L929 cells. As controls, we used mock-transfected VMR-0-conditioned medium and recombinant TNF. After a 5-h incubation, fragmented DNA in the cytoplasm was recovered and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Murine L929 cells were triggered to undergo apoptosis by the soluble form of the Tag7 protein and recombinant TNF but not with supernatant from VMR-0 cells as, evidenced from intranucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6 C). TNF has been shown to induce apoptosis and NF-κB activation, two of the most important activities signaled by TNFR-1 (22Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). We investigated whether Tag7 does also activate NF-κB. VMR-0 cells stably transfected with tag7-expressing construct (VMRSX8) did not show changed viability and proliferation. To investigate the NF-κB activation in sensitive to Tag7 cells, L929 cells were treated with either conditioned supernatant from cells transfected with tag7 (VMRSX8) or recombinant human TNF in concentration 10 ng/ml. Nuclear extracts were prepared 2 h later, and reacted with end-labeled NF-κB specific probe and subjected to EMSA (Fig. 7). Tag7 did not induce detectable NF-κB activation in L929 cells, although cytotoxicity of Tag7 was significantly higher than that of TNF during short-term of exposure of the cells to these cytotoxic agents. During the last decade, a number of TNF-related cytokines were identified and cloned. Some of them are produced by tumor cells (11Spriggs D.R. Imamura K. Rodriguez C. Sariban E. Kufe D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,23Armitage G. Sato T.A. MacDaf B.M. Clifford K.N. Alpet A.R. Smith C.A. Fanslow W.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Using the “differential display” technique, we have isolated a novel mouse gene with a remote homology to the TNF family of ligands. It came out first from the genomic organization of the tag7gene. It is similar to the mouse LT-β three-exon structure and the noncanonical TATA box with multiple transcription initiation sites. The promoter regions of TNF, lymphotoxins, and tag7 genes show similarity in regulatory elements, although their combination is unique for each gene. The tissue specificity of tag7 expression also resembles that of mouse LT-β expression with quite a few exceptions. In situ hybridization analysis for tag7 on sections of selected organs also demonstrated the pattern of the signal distribution close to LT-β mRNA. The total level oftag7 mRNA in brain was very low; however, specific cell types gave a strong hybridization signal upon in situhybridization. Specific cortical areas of the brain (the hippocampus and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum) (Fig. 3, B andC) showed a high level of tag7 mRNA content. The same pattern of gene transcription was observed for the mouse LT-β (21Pokholok D.K. Maroulakou I.G. Kuprash D.V. Alimzhanov M.B. Kozlov S.V. Novobratseva T.I. Turetskaya R.L. Green J.E. Nedospasov S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) gene. Only minor differences in the patterns oftag7 and LT-β mRNA distribution were observed. Lymphoid and hematopoietic organs contained Tag7-expressing cells, although in the thymus, the level of tag7 transcription was very low. On the other hand, the level of tag7 transcription in spleen was very high, and on sections, tag7 mRNA was detected almost everywhere (data not shown), whereas LT-β mRNA was predominantly expressed in the white pulp. This implies that two genes may still be differentially regulated and activated through different signaling pathways. A significant level of tag7transcription in lungs could be attributed to the large amount of alveolar macrophages. The presence in the regulatory region of the tag7 gene of NF-κB binding site supposed very fast response on well-known stimuli,e.g. LPS or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which could result in increased transcription of the gene. We detected down-regulation of tag7 transcription in lymphocytes at the early stages of activation. A similar type of down-regulation of TNF mRNA expression in macrophages is mediated through the regulation of NF-κB activation (24Takasuka N. Tokunaga T. Akagawa K.S. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3824-3830PubMed Google Scholar, 25Takasuka N. Matsuura K. Yamamoto S. Akagawa K.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4803-4812PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction in tag7transcription indicates that additional nuclear factors may be missing or that silencers may be activated in such a way that transcription of the tag7 gene is prevented. Activation of thetag7 gene expression was relatively low in splenocytes and tumor cell lines expressing the gene: VMR-L and CSML-0. Alteration in the level of tag7 transcription after establishment transplanted tumors as a cell lines points to the participation of host factors in tag7 transcription. It was further supported by the observation that in B and T cell lines, we were unable to detecttag7 mRNA, although its transcription was abundant in freshly isolated splenocytes. However, we can not rule out the possibility that splenocytes became activated due to isolation procedure. A constitutive level of tag7 expression in the lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues points to a role for this gene in immune system. Furthermore, it is evident that the main step in regulation cascade occurred at the posttranscriptional level. Even insignificant changes in the mRNA production result in a change of overall amount of protein synthesized and its secretion, although constitutive level of Tag7 protein in isolated lymphoid cells is rather high. We did not find any significant homology for Tag7 with any known proteins. However, similarity in genomic organization and expression pattern with lymphotoxin-β motivated us for more detailed amino acid sequence analysis. Low homology allowed multiple alignments, but this analysis revealed the existence of five regions of low homology in the extracellular domains of the Tag7 polypeptide and TNF family members (Fig. 8). In the first two regions, the level of identity with other TNF family ligands is relatively high, especially in residues buried in the β-sheet interior (26Smith C. Farrah T. Goodvin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar). The rest of the domains show less homology, but the buried residues are still conservative. Moreover, gel filtration data support the similarity in quaternary structure of Tag7 and TNF family ligands. Like lymphotoxins and TNF itself, native secreted Tag7 was detected as a multimer, and the molecular weight of the complex allows us to speculate that it forms trimers. However, whether Tag7 forms homo- or heterotrimers is unknown. Tag7 is rich in cysteine residues and, like LT-α, contains 4 methionine residues (27Aggarwal B.B. Henzel W.J. Moffat B. Kohr W.J. Harkins R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2334-2339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tag7 gene was mapped on mouse chromosome 7. Previously, it was observed that many of TNF-related genes are clustered in the genome. TNF/lymphotoxins genes are linked on mouse chromosome 17 and human chromosome 6 (28Spies T. Morton C.C. Nedospasov S.A. Fiers W. Pious D. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8699-8702Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 29Nedospasov S.A. Hirt B. Shakhov A.N. Dobrynin V.N.

Immunol. 1987; 139: 476-483PubMed Google Scholar). The tag7 gene does not map on the same chromosome with other known TNF ligand family members. Chromosome location offers a possible in vivo role of thetag7 gene. The cytogenetic band 7A3 has been genetically linked with lupus-like nephritis in the MRL and New Zealand hybrid models of systemic lupus erythrematosus (31Kono D.H. Burlingame R.W. Owens D.G. Kuramochi A. Balderas R.S. Balomenos D. Theofilopoulos A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10168-10172Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 32Morel L. Rudofsky U.H. Longmate J.A. Schiffenbauer J. Wakeland E.K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 219-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Although systemic lupus erythrematosus is unlikely to involve mutations with severe functional alterations, gene knockout experiments may provide insight into pathogenic process. Tag7 released in conditioned medium possesses cytotoxicity and triggers intranucleosomal DNA fragmentation in target cells in the same way as many known members of the TNF family. Fragmentation of DNA is one of the characteristics of apoptosis. We can not exclude possibility that Tag7 acts via binding with known “death domain” receptors, but it is unlikely that TNF receptor is involved in the apoptotic cell death caused by Tag7. Cell lines that naturally produce Tag7 protein, such as CSML-0 or VMR-0 (which was engineered to produce it) (33Korobko, E. V., Saschenko, L. P., Prockhorchouk, E. B., Korobko, I. V., Gnuchev, N. V., and Kiselev, S. L. Cell Death Differ., in press.Google Scholar), are easily susceptible to killing by TNF. Another piece of evidence that points to the existence of a specific Tag7 receptor is the existence of different pathways of signal transduction. In addition to inducing apoptosis, TNF receptor 1, CD95 (Apo1), DR3, DR4, and DR5 can activate the transcription factor NF-κB (34Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Yu G.L. Lyons R.H. Garg M. Duan D.R.

Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). We did not detect up-regulation of nuclear NF-κB in target L929 cells in the presence of secreted Tag7 protein. However, we can not rule out the possibility that in another system, Tag7 would induce NF-κB activation, as observed for TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) receptors (38Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). A tumor can produce cytokine; this may have important consequences, which may be direct (promoting or inhibiting tumor growth) or indirect (changing such growth through interactions on the microenvironment). The effect of a single cytokine, however, cannot be readily predicted, because its presence induces other cytokine(s), which can significantly affect the primary action. Recent studies with the tumor cells transformed with tag7 demonstrated the important role of the gene in tumor growth. 2S. L. Kiselev, O. S. Kustikova, E. V. Korobko, and G. P.

https://openalex.org/W2056528957,"We have previously mapped the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the rat lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (rLHR) to a locus of four serines (Ser635, Ser639, Ser649, and Ser652) located in the C-terminal tail. The removal or mutation of this locus delays the time course of agonist-induced uncoupling of the rLHR from its effector system without affecting the overall magnitude of uncoupling, and it retards the endocytosis of the agonist-receptor complex.We have now prepared and analyzed four new rLHR mutants in which each of these serines were individually mutated to alanines. The data presented show that each mutation reduces agonist-promoted rLHR phosphorylation by 20–40%. Mutation of Ser635 or Ser639 delayed the time course of agonist-induced uncoupling to about the same extent as the simultaneous mutation of all four serines. Mutation of Ser635 or Ser639 also retarded agonist-induced internalization, but the magnitude of this decrease was less than that induced by the simultaneous mutation of all four serines. Mutation of Ser649 had no effect on agonist-induced uncoupling but retarded agonist-induced internalization to the same extent as the simultaneous mutation of all four serines. Mutation of Ser652 has little or no effect on either of these two parameters.Co-transfection studies with dominant-negative arrestins and dominant-negative dynamin reveal that, despite differences in their rates of internalization, rLHR-wild-type, rLHR-S639A, and rLHR-S649A are internalized by an arrestin- and dynamin-dependent pathway.These data show that the structural requirements needed for the agonist-induced uncoupling and internalization of the rLHR are distinct.

Phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; LHR, lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor; rLHR, rat LHR; wt, wild-type; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; LH, lutropin; CG, choriogonadotropin; hCG, human CG; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; oLH, ovine lutropin; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; LHR, lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor; rLHR, rat LHR; wt, wild-type; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; LH, lutropin; CG, choriogonadotropin; hCG, human CG; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; oLH, ovine lutropin; HA, hemagglutinin. on serine and/or threonine residues is an important event in agonist-induced desensitization. GPCR phosphorylation by second messenger-dependent kinases attenuates signaling by uncoupling the receptors from their cognate G proteins, whereas phosphorylation by the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) facilitates the interaction of the receptors with a family of inhibitory proteins called arrestins (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 2Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). This phosphorylated receptor-arrestin interaction uncouples the receptors from their cognate G proteins and targets the activated receptor to clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization (1Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 2Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Thus, the complex formed by the phosphorylated GPCR and arrestin serves as a common intermediate for the uncoupling of the receptor from its cognate G protein and for receptor internalization. Using human kidney 293 cells stably transfected with the rat lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (rLHR) cDNA, we showed that, like many other GPCRs, the rLHR becomes phosphorylated on serine residues when the cells are stimulated with an agonist (lutropin (LH) or choriogonadotropin (CG)) (5Hipkin R.W. Sánchez-Yagüe J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The identity of the kinases that mediate the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the rLHR is not known; however, neither kinase A nor kinase C can fully account for the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the rLHR (5Hipkin R.W. Sánchez-Yagüe J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of one of the GRKs in the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the rLHR is suggested by the finding that overexpression of GRK2, GRK4, or GRK6 enhances agonist-induced phosphorylation. 2M. d. F. M. Lazari and M. Ascoli, unpublished observations. 2M. d. F. M. Lazari and M. Ascoli, unpublished observations. A GRK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the rLHR is also suggested by functional studies showing that co-transfection of the rLHR with GRK2 or GRK4 diminishes the hCG-induced cAMP response (7Premont R.T. Macrae A.D. Stoffel R.H. Chung N. Pitcher J.A. Ambrose C. Inglese J. MacDonald M.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6403-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). By analogy with what is known about other GPCRs (see above) we proposed that the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the rLHR was responsible for the agonist-induced uncoupling of this receptor from its effector system (5Hipkin R.W. Sánchez-Yagüe J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further analysis of rLHR mutants truncated at residues 653, 631, or 628 (designated rLHR-t653, rLHR-t631, or rLHR-t628) and a full-length rLHR mutant with multiple serine substitutions (designated rLHR-5S/T→A) mapped the agonist-induced phosphorylation to a cluster of four serine residues (Ser635, Ser639, Ser649, and Ser652) present in the C-terminal tail and established some functional consequences of phosphorylation of this cluster (6Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Liu X. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Rat LHR-t653, a truncated form of rLHR that retains Ser635, Ser639, Ser649, and Ser652, displays little or no reduction in the agonist-induced phosphorylation, as well as a normal time course and magnitude of agonist-induced uncoupling. On the other hand, rLHR-t631 and rLHR-t628, two truncated forms of the rLHR that lack Ser635, Ser639, Ser649, and Ser652, and a full-length receptor mutant in which these four residues were simultaneously mutated to alanines (i.e.rLHR-5S/T→A) display a 90–100% decrease in agonist-induced phosphorylation and a delay in the rate of agonist-induced uncoupling. The magnitude of agonist-induced uncoupling observed under prolonged agonist stimulation is unaffected, however (8Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Liu X. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has been known for many years that one of the consequences of agonist binding to the LHR is the endocytosis of the agonist-receptor complex (10Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13306-13311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the endocytosis of the agonist-bound LHR has been shown to occur via coated pits (11Ghinea N. Vuhai M.T. Groyer-Picard M.-T. Houllier A. Schoëvaërt D. Milgrom E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the rate of endocytosis of the agonist-receptor complex is rather slow (half-life of 60–120 min, depending on the cell type; see Refs. 9Wang Z. Liu X. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13306-13311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hoelscher S.R. Sairam M.R. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2837-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, and 13Dhanwada K.R. Vijapurkar U. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 544-554PubMed Google Scholar), and the majority of the agonist-receptor complex is routed to the lysosomes, where both the agonist and the receptor are degraded (11Ghinea N. Vuhai M.T. Groyer-Picard M.-T. Houllier A. Schoëvaërt D. Milgrom E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Ascoli M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1242-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This pathway ultimately leads to an agonist-induced reduction in the density of cell surface receptors by routing the receptor to a degradation rather than a recycling pathway (14Ascoli M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1242-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Wang H. Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 780-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In keeping with current views on the internalization of other GPCRs, we have shown that the activation of the rLHR is necessary for efficient endocytosis (12Hoelscher S.R. Sairam M.R. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2837-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Dhanwada K.R. Vijapurkar U. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 544-554PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the importance of the phosphorylation of the four-serine locus mentioned above in the endocytosis of the receptor-bound agonist was documented by the finding that cells expressing rLHR-5S/T→A internalize the bound agonist at a slower rate than cells expressing the wild-type rLHR (9Wang Z. Liu X. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The experiments presented here were designed to determine which of the four serine residues present in this locus of the rLHR become phosphorylated and to more carefully define the role of each of these residues in the agonist-induced uncoupling and internalization of the rLHR. To this end, we constructed and analyzed four new rLHR mutants in which Ser635, Ser639, Ser649, or Ser652 was individually mutated to an alanine residue in the context of the full-length rLHR. These mutants were analyzed for phosphorylation, uncoupling, and internalization. The cloning of the rat luteal LH/CG receptor cDNA and the template plasmid containing the full-length coding region plus portions of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the wild-type rLHR cDNA have been described previously (16McFarland K.C. Sprengel R. Phillips H.S. Kohler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The individual Ser to Ala mutants were constructed using polymerase chain reaction strategies to alter the nucleotides coding for these residues. The sequence of the entire region of each mutant cDNA generated by polymerase chain reaction was verified by automated DNA sequencing. The mutant and wild-type rLHR cDNAs were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNAI/Neo (Invitrogen) for transfection. A plasmid encoding for an HA-tagged dominant-negative mutant form of dynamin (i.e. dynamin-K44A; see Ref. 17Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar) was obtained from Sandra Schmid and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for transfection. The expression vectors (all in pcDNA3.1) encoding for β-arrestin, arrestin-3, β-arrestin-V53D, and β-arrestin (319–418) have also been described (4Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Transient co-transfections of human embryonic kidney (293) cells were done using calcium phosphate as described by Chen and Okayama (18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Cells plated in 100-mm dishes were transfected when 70–80% confluent using 10 μg of each plasmid. After an overnight incubation, the cells were washed and incubated in growth medium for 1–2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then trypsinized, distributed into 35-mm wells (5–10 × 105 cells/well), and used 24 h later. Stably transfected cell lines were obtained following G418 selection and cloning as described elsewhere (6Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dhanwada K.R. Vijapurkar U. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 544-554PubMed Google Scholar). The establishment and properties of two clonal cell lines expressing rLHR-wt (designated 293L(wt-12) and 293L(wt-17)) and a clonal cell line expressing a mutant in which Ser635, Thr638, Ser639, Ser649, and Ser652 were simultaneously mutated to alanines (designated 293L(5S/T→A-2) have been described (8Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Liu X. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,19Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and were metabolically labeled during a 4-h incubation in phosphate-free medium containing 200 μCi/ml32Pi. Receptor phosphorylation was ascertained after incubating the 32Pi-prelabeled cells at 37 °C with buffer only, or with 1000 ng/ml oLH for 5 min. These conditions were chosen to elicit a maximal response (5Hipkin R.W. Sánchez-Yagüe J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Hipkin R.W. Wang Z.

One cell line expressing rLHR-wt (either 293L(wt-12) or 293L(wt-17)) and one cell line expressing one of the rLHR mutants was used in each experiment. Following lysis of the cells, the amount of wt and mutant receptor used for immunoprecipitation was equalized based on125I-hCG binding assays (see below). Immunoprecipitations were performed using Bugs (a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the rLHR (20Rosemblit N. Ascoli M. Segaloff D.L. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2284-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) or a mixture of AntiL and R02 (two polyclonal antibodies directed against synthetic peptides derived from the known amino acid sequence of the rLHR (19Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Rodrı́guez M.C. Segaloff D.L. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). The methodology used for immunoprecipitation and SDS gels was the same as that described earlier (5Hipkin R.W. Sánchez-Yagüe J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms of the dried gels were obtained using Kodak BioMax MS film and intensifying screens. The autoradiograms were scanned using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imaging System and captured in a digital format for presentation. Equilibrium binding parameters for hCG were measured during an overnight incubation (4 °C) of intact cells with a fixed concentration of125I-hCG and increasing concentrations of hCG as described previously (6Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar). Concentration-response curves for the hCG-induced increases in cAMP accumulation were obtained by measuring total cAMP levels in cells that had been incubated with at least five different concentrations of hCG for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The different parameters that describe the concentration response curves were calculated as described elsewhere (6Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of agonist-induced uncoupling in stably transfected cells were performed as follows. Cells expressing rLHR-wt or the mutant receptors were divided into two groups and incubated without (group A) or with (group B) 100 ng/ml oLH or hCG for 15 min. 3All data were combined because no differences were noted when oLH or hCG were used. All cells were then washed with neutral and acidic buffers to remove the free and bound hormone, respectively, and each group of cells was subdivided into two groups, which were then incubated without (groups A1 and B1) or with (groups A2 and B2) 100 ng/ml hCG for 15 min at 37 °C (6Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular levels of cAMP were measured at the end of this incubation, and agonist-induced uncoupling was calculated as follows: ((B2 − B1)/(A2 − A1)) × 100. This same assay could not be used to measure uncoupling in transiently transfected cells because of their reduced responsiveness. Thus, when using transiently transfected cells, uncoupling was simply assessed by measuring the total levels of cAMP accumulated by the cells during a 15-min incubation with a saturating concentration of hCG (100 ng/ml) in medium containing a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (6Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Premont R.T. Macrae A.D. Stoffel R.H. Chung N. Pitcher J.A. Ambrose C. Inglese J. MacDonald M.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

The endocytosis of125I-hCG was measured in cells that had been briefly preincubated (i.e. 10 min at room temperature) with 40 ng/ml125I-hCG. At the end of this preincubation, the free hormone was removed by washing, and the cells were re-incubated in fresh, hormone-free medium at 37 °C for up to 4 h. After the desired interval, the cells were placed on ice, and the medium was saved. The cells were briefly treated with an isotonic pH 3 buffer (10Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13306-13311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Dhanwada K.R. Vijapurkar U. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 544-554PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity that was released by the acid treatment was considered to be surface-bound, whereas the radioactivity that remained cell-associated was considered to be internalized. The medium was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the acid-insoluble and -soluble radioactivity were considered to be undegraded and degraded hormone, respectively (10Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13306-13311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dhanwada K.R. Vijapurkar U. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 544-554PubMed Google Scholar). Because there is little or no dissociation of the receptor-bound hCG during this incubation (10Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13306-13311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of disappearance of the receptor bound hCG can be used to measure the rate of internalization. The rates of internalization (ke) were thus calculated from the slopes of linear regression fits to plots of the ln of the surface-bound hCGversus time. The half-life of internalization (t½) is therefore defined as 0.693/ke. Expression of the transfected arrestins and dynamin was ascertained by immunoblots using the ECL system of detection. The different arrestin constructs were detected using a polyclonal antibody (KEE) raised against a C-terminal 16 residue peptide (22Sterne-Marr R. Gurevich V.V. Goldsmith P. Bodine R.C. Sanders C. Donoso L.A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15640-15648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a mouse monoclonal antibody (F4C1) directed against an epitope common to all known arrestins (23Donoso L.A. Gregerson D.S. Smith L. Robertson S. Knospe V. Vrabec T. Kalsow C.M. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged dynamin was detected using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). Purified hCG (CR-127) and oLH (AFP-5551B) were obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Agency of the NIDDK, National Institutes of Health.125I-hCG was prepared as described previously (24Ascoli M. Puett D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), to give a specific radioactivity of 25,000–30,000 cpm/ng. [32P]Orthophosphate was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Phosphate-free DMEM was purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors,N,N′,N“-triacetylchitotriose, protein A-agarose, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Okadaic acid and cypermethrin were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Woburn, MA). Wheat germ agglutinin agarose was from Vector Laboratories. Cell culture supplies and reagents were obtained from Corning (Corning, NY) and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. All other materials were obtained from commonly used suppliers. Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphorylation experiments utilizing three different C-terminal truncations of the rLHR and a full-length mutant with multiple Ser to Ala mutations have identified Ser635, Ser639, Ser649, and Ser652 as the major locus of rLHR phosphorylation in transfected cells (6Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Liu X. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the experiments presented here, we prepared four new full-length rLHR mutants in which each of these four serines was individually mutated to alanine. Each mutant cDNA (designated rLHR-S635A, rLHR-S639A, rLHR-S649A, and rLHR-S652A) was transfected into human kidney 293 cells, and clonal lines stably expressing each of the mutants were obtained. All mutant receptors bound hCG with an affinity comparable to that detected in cells expressing rLHR-wt (i.e. about 200 pm, see TableI). Of the several clonal lines obtained with each mutant, we chose those with the highest cell surface receptor density for further study (Table I).Table IhCG binding and cAMP responsiveness of clonal lines of 293 cells expressing the wild-type and mutant receptorsCell linehCG bindingaEquilibrium binding parameters were determined using intact cells during an overnight incubation at 4 °C as described under “Materials and Methods.” Each number represents the average ± S.E. of 4–6 independent experiments.cAMP responsivenessbTotal (i.e. cells + medium) levels of cAMP were measured in cells incubated in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and increasing concentrations of hCG for 30 min or in cells incubated with a single concentration (500 ng/ml) of cholera toxin for 2 h, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The response ratio shown in the far right was calculated by dividing the average maximal response obtained for hCG over the average maximal response obtained for cholera toxin.

We chose 293L(wt-12) and 293L(wt-17) as control cell lines because their receptor density (100,000-200,000 receptors/cell) is comparable to that of the cell lines expressing the mutant receptors, and at these levels of receptor expression, the cAMP response is basically independent of receptor density (6Hipkin R.W.

In an attempt to correct for an inherent variability in the basal and hCG-stimulated levels of cAMP, we also measured the levels of cAMP in the different cell lines stimulated with cholera toxin and calculated a response ratio by dividing the maximal hCG response by the maximal cholera toxin response. As shown in TableI, this ratio shows that all mutants respond to hCG as well as or better than cells expressing rLHR-wt. It is noted"

In order to detect additional isoforms that might be expressed from that gene, we used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays and evaluated the presence of all product combinations of two alternative internal exons (6a and 6b) and four carboxyl-terminal exons (9a, 9b, 9c, and 9d) in developing and adult rat brain. We identified five different combinations for exon 9 (9a + 9b, 9a + 9c, 9a + 9d, 9c, and 9d), and the exon combinations 9a + 9c and 9a + 9d were previously unreported. Each of these combinations existed with both exon 6a and exon 6b. Thus, the rat brain generates at least 10 different isoforms from the Tm5 gene. Northern blot hybridization with alternative exon-specific probes revealed that these isoforms were also expressed in a number of different adult rat tissues, although some exons are preferentially expressed in particular tissues. Studies of regulation of the 10 different Tm5 isoform mRNAs during rat brain development indicated that no two isoforms are coordinately accumulated. Furthermore, there is a developmental switch in the use of exon 6a to exon 6b from embryonic to adult isoforms. TM5 protein isoforms show a differential localization in the adult cerebellum. Four nonmuscle tropomyosin isoforms have been reported to be produced from the rat Tm5 gene by alternative splicing (Beisel, K. W., and Kennedy, J. E. (1994) Gene (Amst.) 145, 251–256). In order to detect additional isoforms that might be expressed from that gene, we used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays and evaluated the presence of all product combinations of two alternative internal exons (6a and 6b) and four carboxyl-terminal exons (9a, 9b, 9c, and 9d) in developing and adult rat brain. We identified five different combinations for exon 9 (9a + 9b, 9a + 9c, 9a + 9d, 9c, and 9d), and the exon combinations 9a + 9c and 9a + 9d were previously unreported. Each of these combinations existed with both exon 6a and exon 6b. Thus, the rat brain generates at least 10 different isoforms from the Tm5 gene. Northern blot hybridization with alternative exon-specific probes revealed that these isoforms were also expressed in a number of different adult rat tissues, although some exons are preferentially expressed in particular tissues. Studies of regulation of the 10 different Tm5 isoform mRNAs during rat brain development indicated that no two isoforms are coordinately accumulated. Furthermore, there is a developmental switch in the use of exon 6a to exon 6b from embryonic to adult isoforms. TM5 protein isoforms show a differential localization in the adult cerebellum. Tropomyosins are rod-like proteins that are associated with actin filament in muscle and nonmuscle cells. Multiple isoforms of tropomyosins exist in both muscle and nonmuscle cells (1Pittenger M.F. Kazzaz J.A. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In muscle cells, tropomyosins play a pivotal role in regulating the interaction between the actin and myosin filaments. The role of tropomyosins in nonmuscle cells is beginning to be more defined. They are thought to differentially affect the stability of actin filaments (2Ishakawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7490-7497PubMed Google Scholar) and have been shown to be implicated in various cellular functions including the regulation of cell transformation (3Leavitt J. Ng S.-Y. Varma M.

Alternative splicing accounts for the majority of tropomyosin isoform diversity. In mammals, four tropomyosin genes have been identified, α-Tmf (14Ruiz-Opazo N. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4755-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β-Tm (15Helfman D.M. Cheley S. Kuismanen E. Finn L.A. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1988; 201: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Except for the Tm4 gene, it is now clear that the other three rat tropomyosin genes contain two alternate promoters (exons 1a and 1b), two alternative internal exons (6a and 6b), and four alternative COOH-terminal exons (9a, 9b, 9c, and 9d). Therefore, the tropomyosin genes can each theoretically generate mRNAs for at least 16 isoforms. However, only 20 isoforms have been characterized from all four rat tropomyosin genes (14Ruiz-Opazo N.

This suggests that some exon combinations either do not occur or are unique to cell types that have not yet been studied. In the case of the rat Tm5 gene, one muscle isoform and four nonmuscle isoforms have been reported to date. The muscle product of this gene is known as α-Tms since it is preferentially expressed in slow-twitch skeletal muscle (25Gunning P. Gordon M. Wade R. Gahlman R. Lin C.-S. Hardeman E. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The four nonmuscle isoforms have been termed Tm5 NM1 to NM4 (23Beisel K.W. Kennedy J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), butTm5 NM1 was previously referred as the fibroblastic TM30 nm isoform (22MacLeod A.R. Houlker C. Reinach F.C. Talbot K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8413-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or Tm5 isoform (26Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Kageyama H. Sakiyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These four nonmuscle isoforms have been identified in the rat cochlea and varied in their usage of alternative exons 6a and 6b, 9a + 9b, 9d and 9c (Fig. 3). In order to detect additional isoforms that might be expressed from theTm5 gene, we used systematic RT-PCR 1The abbreviations used are: RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; Tm, tropomyosin; a.a., amino acid; bp, base pair(s); UTR, untranslated region; kb, kilobase pair(s). assays to evaluate the presence of all product combinations of two alternative internal exons (6a and 6b) and four carboxyl-terminal exons (9a, 9b, 9c, and 9d) of the Tm5 gene in the developing and adult rat brain. We have identified novel splice combinations, and at least 10 nonmuscle isoforms are produced from that gene in the rat brain. These isoforms are independently regulated during rat brain development. Furthermore, a switch occurs in the use of exon 6a to exon 6b from embryonic to the adult isoforms. In the case of two isoforms, Tm5 NM1 and NM2, isoform switching coincides with a shift in sorting to different neuronal compartments. Embryonic and adult rat tissues were collected from Sprague-Dawley rats, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Frozen tissues were homogenized in phenol/guanidine isothiocyanate, and RNA was extracted as described (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotide probes were synthesized from the ratTm5 cDNA sequence (published in Ref. 23Beisel K.W. Kennedy J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as follows: the H92 probe (position 552–680), specific for exons 7 and 8 (a.a. 179–221 from nonmuscle Tm5), and the H169 probe (position 683–761), specific for exon 9a (a.a. 222–248 from nonmuscleTm5). 100 ng of oligonucleotides were 3′-end-labeled using a Gigaprime labeling kit (Bresatec, Australia) by incubation with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP and the large Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase at 37 °C for 15 min. 1 μg of antisense nucleotides specific to the 3′-end of each DNA probe was used to prime the reactions. A human Tm5 cDNA probe, pHMαTms-SA, which is a gene-specific and well conserved cross-species, has been characterized previously (25Gunning P. Gordon M. Wade R. Gahlman R. Lin C.-S. Hardeman E. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This DNA fragment encodes a.a. 213–284 plus 48 bp of the 3′-UTR fromTm5, or the corresponding a.a. 177–248 from nonmuscleTm5. A 1,500-bp probe corresponding to the entire 9d 3′-UTR, pMMTm5–3′UT, and generated from a mouse Tm5nonmuscle cDNA by PCR amplification has been characterized previously (28Schevzov G. Lloyd C. Hailstones D. Gunning P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two other probes, 3′UT244, corresponding to the 5′ end of the 9d 3′-UTR (bp 760 to 1190), and 3′UT110, corresponding to the central region of the 9d 3′-UTR (bp 1200 to 1800), were generated by PCR amplification using the following pairs of primers: 5′ GAGATGTAGACCTTCCCCATC 3′/5′ GTATCCATTAGGCTAAGATGTGC 3′ and 5′ ATGGAGGAGAAACACAGGAATG 3′/5′ GAAGATTTCGCCAGCACTGAC 3′. Amplification was carried out using rat fibroblast cDNA. Two oligonucleotide probes, H135 (position 774–909) and H136 (position 910–1056) corresponding to the entire 9c 3′-UTR, were synthesized from the rat Tm5 cDNA sequence and used simultaneously for hybridization. To obtain a probe that could recognize specifically exon 9a, the human Tm5 cDNA previously described (25Gunning P. Gordon M. Wade R. Gahlman R. Lin C.-S. Hardeman E. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), pHMαTms-SA, was digested by SacI. This DNA fragment encodes a.a. 259–284 plus 48 bp of the 3′-UTR fromTm5 or the corresponding a.a. 223–248 from nonmuscleTm5. Oligonucleotide probes specific for exon 6a (H182) and exon 6b (H184) were synthesized from the ratTm5 cDNA sequence (23Beisel K.W. Kennedy J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These probes are identical in sequence to the four last a.a. encoded by exon 5 (a.a 149–152) plus the entire exon 6a or exon 6b (a.a 153–178) plus the four first a.a. encoded by exon 7 (a.a. 179–182) from nonmuscle Tm5 or the corresponding a.a 185–218 from Tm5. Rat Tm5-specific oligonucleotides were chosen from the rat Tm5 cDNA (23Beisel K.W. Kennedy J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as follows: exon 1b, GCAAGATCCAGGTTCTGCAG (position 53–72); exon 6a, CGTTGCCGAGAGATGGATGAG (position 475–495); exon 6b, GTGTTCTGAGCTGGAGGAGG (position 477–496); exon 9b, CAGAGCAGAAACGGTGTCAG (position 767–786); exon 9c, CTTGCTTAGGGCGAACAGTGAC (position 840–861); and exon 9d, GCCCTCAGTTTCAAGGCCAGC (position 843–863). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA in a final volume of 50 μl containing 20 units of RNase H reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.), 750 ng of random hexamers (Promega), 0.4 mm each dNTPs, 5 units of RNasin, and 100 mmdithiothreitol. Reaction was performed for 75 min at 37 °C. PCR reactions were then conducted for 35 cycles in a total volume of 20 μl using 6-μl aliquots of a 5-fold dilution of the RT reaction andTm5-specific primers, 80 ng each, in the presence of 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), and 0.2 mm each dNTPs. RT-PCR products were resolved in agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. For Southern blot analysis, RT-PCR products were transferred onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to Ref. 29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. Oligonucleotide probes specific for rat Tm5exons 7 and 8 (H92) or exon 9a (H169) were labeled using specific 3′ antisense primers and hybridized to DNA blots at 106 cpm/ml in a solution of 4× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), and 10% dextran sulfate at 60 °C for 16 h. The blots were then washed once with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min and twice with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min each. Filters were exposed to Kodak Biomax film for a few hours. For sequencing, amplified Tm5 cDNA fragments were excised from agarose gel, isolated by glass-wool extraction, and purified by ethanol precipitation. DNA sequence was determined with a DNA sequencer (373A Applied Biosystems) using dye fluorescent labels. Sequence data were determined in the sense and antisense orientations. The CG3 antibody is a monoclonal antibody whose epitope has been mapped to a.a. 29–44 encoded by exon 1b of the Tm5 gene (30Novy R.E. Sellers J.R. Liu L.-F. Lin J.J.-L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 25: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and has been kindly provided by Jim J.-C. Lin. The WS 5/9d polyclonal antibody was directed against a peptide DKLKCT corresponding to a.a. 222–227 of exon 9d and raised in rabbit, as described previously (12Weinberger R. Schevzov G. Jeffrey P. Gordon K. Hill M. Gunning P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 238-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide ESLYRQLERNSLLSNELKLTL corresponding to a.a. 222–241 of exon 9c was used to generate rabbit antiserum and referred to as WD 5/9c. The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Adult rat cerebellum was fixed and prepared for sectioning as described previously (11Hannan A.J. Schevzov G. Gunning P. Jeffrey P.L. Weinberger R.P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Weinberger R. Schevzov G. Jeffrey P. Gordon K. Hill M. Gunning P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 238-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100. Secondary antibodies were used at 1:250. Samples of total RNA were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing 6% formaldehyde and blotted to Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes were labeled using random or specific 3′ antisense primers and hybridized to RNA blots under identical conditions as for Southern blots, but hybridization and washes were conducted at 65 °C. For probes specific for exon 6a (H182), exon 6b (H184), and exon 9a (pHMαTms-Sac), hybridization was performed at 60 °C and washing at 55 °C. Filters were exposed for 24–48 h to phosphor screens which were scanned by a Molecular Dynamics Laser PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To correct for loading and transfer errors, Northern blots were hybridized to an 18 S specific ribosomal RNA oligonucleotide. mRNA levels were quantified using the Molecular Dynamics Laser PhosphorImager. To evaluate the extent ofTm5 isoform diversity, total RNA was isolated from developing and adult rat brain and analyzed by RT-PCR. Specific oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify the products resulting from each possible splicing combination occurring between the two internal exons 6 (6a and 6b) and the four carboxyl-terminal exons 9 (9a, 9b, 9c, and 9d) (Fig. 1). The specificity of the RT-PCR products was then confirmed by Southern blot hybridization to an oligonucleotide probe identical to the region coding for constitutive exons 7 and 8 (Fig. 1 A). For both primer pairs 6a/9d (Fig. 1 A, panel 1, upper) and 6b/9d (Fig. 1 A, panel 1, lower), two bands were detected. The size of the smaller (and major) band was consistent with the expected size of PCR products containing, respectively, the exon combinations 6a + 9d, and 6b + 9d, based on the published patterns of alternative splicing for Tm5 NM1 and NM2 isoforms (23Beisel K.W. Kennedy J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For both primer pairs, the two bands differed by 80 base pairs. This raised the possibility that an additional exon may be included in the larger band. The presence of exon 9a in the larger product was demonstrated by hybridization to an oligonucleotide probe specific for this exon (Fig. 1 B, panel 1). The exon combination 9a + 9d was a previously unreported splice event, and we found it existed with both exon 6a and 6b. For both primer pairs 6a/9c and 6b/9c, two bands differing by 80 base pairs were also detected (Fig. 1 A, panel 2). The smaller band was in agreement with the exon combinations 6b + 9c, corresponding to NM4 isoform, and 6a + 9c, respectively, which was a novel splice variant. Again, exon 9a was shown to be present in the larger band, resulting in two additional splice variants containing the exon combination 9a + 9c with both exons 6a and 6b (Fig. 1 B, panel 2). Finally, primer pairs 6a/9b and 6b/9b detected only a single band of the predicted size for products containing the exon combinations 6b + 9a + 9b, corresponding to NM3 isoform, and 6a + 9a + 9b, respectively, which was previously unreported (Fig. 1 A, panel 3). To determine the exact nucleotide sequence identity of the novel splice variants containing exon 9a, amplified cDNA fragments were extracted from the gel and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences for the fragments amplified with primer pairs 6b/9d and 6b/9c from adult rat brain and the amino acid sequences predicted by the new mRNA splice junctions are given in Fig. 2 A. The novel RNA splicing patterns occur between the 5′-splice donor site of exon 9a and the 3′-acceptor sites of exon 9d or exon 9c. When they are spliced to exon 8, exons 9d and 9c are each capable of encoding a unique 27 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residue protein fragment. The splice event exon 9a to 9d introduces a termination codon in the second to fourth nucleotides of exon 9d, leaving the entire 9d sequence as a 3′-UTR. The exon 9a to 9d splice variant cDNA was previously cloned from a mouse macrophage library, and its 3′-UTR was partially sequenced (31Hailstones D. Regulation of Expression of Genes for Contractile Protein Isoforms. Ph.D thesis. University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia1994Google Scholar). The splice event 9a to 9c creates a novel reading frame with a termination codon in the first seven codons of exon 9c, resulting in an amino acid change in the first six residues normally encoded by exon 9c, and leaving the remaining 9c sequence as a 3′-UTR. This novel reading frame is conserved in the rat and human genes. These two splicing events exist with both exon 6a and 6b. Moreover, in some of the RT-PCR assays performed on adult rat brain samples, the larger band amplified with primer pair 6a/9c did not hybridize to the exon 9a probe, suggesting that this band contained distinct Tm5 products of similar size which did not possess exon 9a (Fig. 1, A and B, panels 2, adult lane). This band was sequenced and corresponds to exon 6a spliced to exon 6b. The nucleotide sequence at the junction between exon 6a and exon 6b for the fragment amplified with primer pairs 6a/9c from adult rat brain is given in Fig. 2 B. This splicing pattern introduces a premature termination codon in the first codon of exon 6b, resulting in a truncated Tm protein of 178 amino acid residues. We also identified a product containing both exons 6a and 6b when amplification was performed with primer pair 6a/9d (data not shown). The amino-terminal region of the Tm5 gene contains two alternative promoters, associated with exons 1a and 1b. To determine from which promoter the novel variants were produced, RT-PCR assays were performed on developing and adult rat brain samples with primer pairs 1b/9d, 1b/9c, and 1b/9b. Positive hybridization to oligonucleotide probes specific for exons 6a, 6b, and 9a demonstrated that the promoter associated with exon 1b, or nonmuscle promoter, could account for all the novel isoforms identified in the rat brain (data not shown). We were unable to amplify the Tm5 sequence using an exon 1a-specific primer from rat brain cDNA. The nomenclature previously introduced by Beisel and Kennedy (23Beisel K.W. Kennedy J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was used to characterize the novel variants which are summarized in Fig. 3. To determine the pattern of expression of these variants in various adult rat tissues, total RNA was isolated from adult rat soleus (slow muscle), skeletal muscle from the leg (slow and fast muscle), testes, kidney, liver, and brain. These samples were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization using four Tm5 probes: a probe specific for exons 7 and 8, full-length 9d 3′-UTR, full-length 9c 3′-UTR, and exon 9a (Fig. 4). Hybridization with the first probe, which is in a constitutive region, confirmed that the muscle-specific 1.3-kb transcript, α-Tms, is highly expressed in soleus and skeletal muscle and is the major isoform of theTm5 gene. This probe also detected a 2.5-kb transcript expressed at very similar levels in both muscle and nonmuscle tissues and a 1.0-kb mRNA in testes. Two minor mRNAs were also detected in brain with sizes estimated at 2.9 and 1.5 kb. Hybridization with 9d 3′-UTR cDNA recognized the 2.5-kb mRNA whose pattern of expression is characteristic of a nonmuscle tropomyosin, as expected (28Schevzov G. Lloyd C. Hailstones D. Gunning P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). According to our RT-PCR results, the 2.5-kb mRNA could account for four isoforms, corresponding to NM1 (exon combination 6a + 9d), NM2 (6b + 9d), NM5 (6a + 9a + 9d), and NM6 (6b + 9a + 9d), which were not independently resolved by this Northern blot analysis. The 9d 3′-UTR probe also detected the 1.0-kb mRNA in testes. In skeletal muscle, two novel transcripts of approximately 1.0 and 1.7 kb were detected. The 1.7-kb mRNA was not clearly detected in the soleus muscle by the full-length 9d 3′-UTR probe which gave a strong 1.0-kb signal. These transcripts will be explained below. The 9c 3′-UTR probe, within the limit of detection in this experiment, hybridized only to the brain 1.5-kb mRNA, suggesting that exon 9c is preferentially expressed in brain. The 1.5-kb transcript could represent NM7 (6a + 9c), NM4 (6b + 9c), NM8 (6a + 9a + 9c), and NM9 (6b + 9a + 9c). Finally, the exon 9a probe detected the muscle 1.3-kb transcript but virtually nothing in other tissues, indicating that the α-Tms isoform is the major product expressing exon 9a. Moreover, the 2.9-kb transcript detected in brain with the exon 7 and 8 probe did not show any positive hybridization to the known 3′-UTRs, suggesting that the 2.9-kb mRNA must contain a novel exon 9 of theTm5 gene. In addition to the nonmuscle 2.5-kb transcript, the full-length 9d 3′-UTR probe recognized the 1.0-kb mRNA in testes and two novel transcripts of 1.7 and 1.0 kb in muscle. Two probes containing, respectively, the 5′ end (position 760–1190) and the central region (position 1190–1800) of the 9d 3′-UTR were produced by PCR amplification and hybridized to soleus, skeletal muscle, and testes RNAs (Fig. 5). The 5′ probe recognized the testes-specific 1.0-kb mRNA, suggesting that this transcript may derive from use of an alternative polyadenylation signal located in the 5′ end of the 9d 3′-UTR. A putative consensus site, ATTA, is located in this region. The central region probe recognized the 1.7-kb mRNA in soleus and skeletal muscle, whereas the full-length probe yielded a strong 1.0-kb signal. These transcripts did not hybridize to a 9d coding region probe either. We hypothesize that these two transcripts may be generated through splicing of exon 8 to an alternative splice acceptor site located in the 3′ end of the 9d 3′-UTR. We then compared the tissue distribution of transcripts containing exon 6a to those containing exon 6b (Fig. 4). It appeared that exon 6a is universally used with an expression pattern similar to that of the nonmuscle exon 9d and that NM1 (6a + 9d) isoform is the commonly used isoform. In contrast, the use of exon 6b is more restricted since it is primarily expressed in muscle and in brain. We have noted differences in the regulation ofTm5 variants during rat brain development with the RT-PCR assays (Fig. 1). We therefore chose to evaluate the temporal regulation of the mRNA splice variants and to compare expression of alternative exons. Total RNA isolated from developing to adult rat brain was size-fractionated and hybridized initially with the exons 7 + 8, 9d 3′-UTR, 9c 3′-UTR, and exon 9a probes (Fig. 6). Direct quantification of32P on the hybridization membrane by PhosphorImager analysis indicated that mRNAs with the 9d 3′-UTR undergo a 5-fold decrease in accumulation from embryo to the adult. In contrast, the level of transcripts containing 9c 3′-UTR is constant. Hybridization with the exon 9a probe indicated that exon 9a is expressed in about equal amounts in all splicing combinations producing the 2.5-kb (9a + 9d), 1.5-kb (9a + 9c), and 1.3-kb (9a + 9b) mRNAs and that accumulation of transcripts containing exon 9a slightly increases from embryo to the adult. Thus, transcript accumulation of Tm5mRNAs is subject to temporal regulation and is different with the use of each alternative carboxyl-terminal exon. We then compared expression of transcripts differing in the use of internal exons 6a and 6b during rat brain development. Fig. 7 A shows that NM1, NM5, NM7, and NM8 mRNAs containing exon 6a are down-regulated from embryo to the adult. Reciprocally, the NM2, NM6, NM4, and NM9 mRNAs containing exon 6b are up-regulated. A switch in the preferential use of exon 6a to exon 6b from the embryonic stages to the adult was also seen with the PCR assays (Fig. 1). This developmental switch from exon 6a to 6b is independent of the terminal exon. To determine if this regulatory pattern was a general phenomenon of Tm5transcripts, expression of these mRNAs during skeletal muscle development was examined. Fig. 7 B shows that the change from the expression of the nonmuscle exon 9d in embryo limbs (2.5-kb transcript) to the muscle-specific exon 9b (1.3-kb transcript) in the adult is associated with the same developmental switch in the use of internal exon from 6a to 6b as the one observed during brain development. Antibodies that identify amino acids encoded by specific exons were used to investigate whether protein isoforms from the Tm5 gene were expressed in adult cerebellum. This brain region was chosen because of its well studied histology and clearly defined polarity orientation of its main neuronal cell types. The CG3 monoclonal antibody recognizes the amino acids encoded by exon 1b and therefore potentially identifies all the nonmuscle isoforms derived from the gene. Fig. 8 A shows that CG3 staining is broadly distributed within the cerebellum. Most prominent staining is present in the Purkinje neuron cell bodies as well as the molecular layer which is densely packed with axons. Within the granule cell layer, staining is seen within the synaptic rich glomeruli but not in the granule cells themselves. In contrast, WS5/9d a polyclonal serum shows a very different expression pattern. This antiserum was raised against a unique sequence within exon 9d and therefore potentially identifies the isoforms NM1 and NM2, although in the adult brain N"
https://openalex.org/W1989833578,"p21-activated kinases (PAKs) bind to and are activated by Rho family GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac. Since these GTPases play key roles in regulating cell polarity, stress responses, and cell cycle progression, the ability of PAK to affect these processes has been examined. We previously showed that fission yeastpak1+ encodes an essential protein that affects mating and cell polarity. Here, we characterize a secondpak gene (pak2+) fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe. Like the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Cla4p and Skm1p, fission yeast Pak2p contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain in addition to a p21-binding domain and a protein kinase domain that are common to other members of the PAK family. Unlike pak1+,pak2+ is not essential for vegetative growth or for mating in S. pombe. Overexpression of the wild-typepak2+ allele suppresses the lethal growth defect associated with deletion of pak1+, and this suppression requires both the pleckstrin homology- and the p21-binding domains of Pak2p, as well as kinase activity. A substantial fraction of Pak2p is associated with membranous components, an association mediated both by the pleckstrin homology- and by the p21-binding domains. These results show that S. pombeencodes at least two pak genes with distinct functions and suggest that the membrane localization of Pak2p, directed by its interactions with membrane lipids and Cdc42p, is critical to its biological activity. p21-activated kinases (PAKs) bind to and are activated by Rho family GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac.

Signal transduction by small GTPases of the Rho family has become the focus of intensive investigation in recent years. Rho GTPases (in mammals, Cdc42, Rac, and Rho) regulate a variety of signaling pathways in higher eukaryotes, including those that affect the organization of cortical actin, stress responses, gene transcription, and cell cycle progression (1Ridley A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 24: 24-30Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In budding and fission yeasts, Cdc42p has been implicated in the generation and maintenance of cell polarity. However, the mechanisms by which Cdc42p and other Rho family GTPases regulate these processes are poorly understood. Several candidate effectors for Rho GTPases have been identified recently, including a variety of protein kinases, GTPase activating proteins, and other proteins that lack obvious enzymatic function. Among these candidate effectors, the p21-activated serine/threonine kinases (PAKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21-activated protein kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; kb, kilobase(s). are currently the best characterized (2Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell. Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). PAKs bind to activated (GTP-bound) forms of Cdc42 and Rac, but not Rho, and are activated as a result of this binding. Like Cdc42 and Rac, PAKs stimulate stress-activated protein kinases (3Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 4Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26067-26070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, dominant interfering forms of PAK block stress-activated protein kinase activation by Cdc42 and Rac1, suggesting that PAKs may be effectors for these GTPases in stress signaling pathways. The role of PAKs in mediating other Cdc42/Rac functions, such as cytoskeletal rearrangements and G1progression, is less clear. In mammalian fibroblasts, expression of activated Pak1 induces changes in focal complex formation and F actin distribution similar but not identical to those induced by Rac1 and Cdc42 (7Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 8Manser E. Huang H.-Y. Loo T.-H. Chen X.Q. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, PAKs may activate multiple pathways, including those that affect gene transcription and those that affect actin dynamics. To better define the targets and functions of PAK, we and others have examined PAKs in yeast. Three PAK homologs have been characterized in budding yeast. The PAK homolog Ste20p is required for pheromone-induced G1 arrest and activation of the transcription factor Ste12p as well as for certain specialized morphogenic processes, such as formation of mating projections and filamentous growth (9Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Forest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 11Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). A second PAK-like kinase, Cla4p, has been shown to regulate formation of the bud neck and may also have other functions that are partially redundant with Ste20p (12Cvrckova F. Manser E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A third kinase of this class, Skm1p, is dispensable for normal growth and mating but yields a multibudded phenotype when overexpressed, suggesting a role in cell morphogenesis (13Martin H. Mendoza A. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Unlike Ste20p or mammalian PAKs, both Cla4p and Skm1p contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain near the N terminus. The functional significance of this extra domain is not known, although it seems likely that it serves to target these kinases to appropriate locations within membrane structures. We recently characterized a PAK-like protein in S. pombe. This kinase, known as Pak1p or Shk1p, is essential for viability and mating and may play important roles in the generation and/or maintenance of cell polarity (14Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Expression ofpak1+ in S. cerevisiae cells deleted for STE20 relieves the mating defect associated with this mutation, indicating that fission yeast pak1+ is to some degree functionally homologous to budding yeastSTE20. During the isolation of pak1+clones, we uncovered a second PAK homolog (pak2+). The protein encoded by this gene, like budding yeast Cla4p and Skm1p, contains an N-terminal PH domain. In this study, we report the biochemical and functional characterization of Pak2p. S. pombe cells were grown in complex medium, YEA (16Gutz H. Heslot H. Leupold U. Loprieno N. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics 1. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1974: 395-446Google Scholar), or in yeast extract plus adenine Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM) supplemented as required (17Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3142) Google Scholar). The haploid strains CHP428 (h+ ura4-D18 leu1–32 his7–366 ade6-M210) and CHP429 (h− ura4-D18 leu1–32 his7–366 ade6-M216) were used to generate diploid cells used for gene disruption. The wild-type strain 972 (h−) was used. S. cerevisiae strains used in this work were the mating tester strain DC17 (MATα his1) (9Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), W303–1A (MAT a ade2 leu2 trp1 ura3 his3 can1) and the W303–1A derivatives YEL206 (MAT a ste20Δ-3:TRP1) (18Wu C. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), M96007–1D (MAT a ste20–4ts cla4Δ::TRP1), YEL252 (MATα/ a ste20Δ-2::URA3/STE20 cla4Δ::TRP1/CLA4), and YEL252–1A (MAT a cla4Δ::TRP1). TheSTE20 and CLA4 genes in these strains were deleted as described previously (9Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Forest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Theste20–4ts mutant allele was identified from a randomly mutagenized STE20 plasmid library by screening for mutants that were capable of mating at room temperature but sterile at 37 °C and then integrated into the genome by homologous recombination. 2C. Wu, M. Whiteway, and E. Leberer, unpublished observations. S. cerevisiae media, culture conditions, and manipulations of yeast strains were as described by Rose et al. (19Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter R. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 155-159Google Scholar). Patch mating tests were carried out as described (20Leberer E. Dignard D. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4805-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The primers 5′-CGG-GAT-CCG-TNG-CNA-T(A/C/T)A-A(A/G)C-A(A/G)A-TGA-A-3′ and 5′-CGG-AAT-TCN-GGN-GG(C/T)-TCN-CC(C/T)-TC(A/G/T)-ATC-AT-3′ were used to amplify an ∼500-base pair pak-like gene fragment from anS. pombe cDNA library, and this PCR product was used to probe the library as described previously (14Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Most positive clones contained partial or full-length pak1+, but one contained a related sequence that we termedpak2+. The sequence of this clone appeared to represent a partial cDNA, since the predicted protein product lacked a recognizable N-terminal p21-binding domain, which is present in Pak1p and other PAKs. While we attempted to isolate a full-length cDNA, the complete pak2+ gene was uncovered during the course of a comprehensive international S. pombegenome sequencing effort. We obtained this clone (ICRFc1F5) from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Reference Library (21Lehrach H. Drmanac R. Hoheisel J. Larin Z. Lennon G. Monaco A.D. Nizetic D. Zehetner G. Poustka A. Davies K.E. Tilghman S.M. Genetic and Physical Mapping. Vol. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The genomicpak2+ clone was identical to our cDNA clone, but it encoded in addition a potential N-terminal PH domain and a p21-binding domain. The pak2+ coding sequence (∼1.8 kilobases (kb)) was amplified by PCR using Deep Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) from a cosmid (ICRFc1F5) containing the genomicpak2+ clone. The PCR product was subcloned as aSmaI/Acc65I fragment into the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagging vector pJ3H (22Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This vector was then cut withAcc65I, blunt-ended, and then digested with SalI and subcloned into SalI-, SmaI-cut pREP3X (a conditional S. pombe expression vector) (23Forsburg S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2955-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged Pak1p constructs have been described previously (14Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Pak2p point mutants (Pak2p H136L,H140L and Pak2p K343A) were created using the Altered States mutagenesis system (Promega) and confirmed by sequence analysis. An N-terminal truncation mutant that deletes the PH domain (ΔPH-Pak2p) was created by digesting pJ3H-pak2 withNheI and XbaI and then religating the linearized 4.8-kb fragment. The pak2 insert from the resulting plasmid, which encodes HA-tagged Pak2p lacking the N-terminal PH domain, was then subcloned into pREP3X as described above. A cosmid (ICRFc1F5) containing the genomicpak2+ clone was digested with SstI, and the resulting 5.8-kb fragment containingpak2+ was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). The plasmid pCG1 (24Grimm C. Kohli J. Murray J. Maundrell K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 215: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), containing the S. pombe ura4+ gene, was digested with HindIII, and the 1.8-kb ura4 fragment was blunt-ended and subcloned intoAatII-, BglII-cut, blunt-endedpak2+. This manipulation replaces the entirepak2+ gene with ura4+. A diploid S. pombe strain was constructed and transformed with the SstI-restrictedpak2+ ::ura4 fragment. Genomic S. pombe DNA was isolated using the protocol of Hoffman and Winston (25Hoffman C. Winston F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). Five μg of DNA was digested with EcoRV, electrophoresed, and transferred to a nylon membrane and cross-linked using UV irradiation. Filters were hybridized overnight at 65 °C in 0.5 mNaPO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin with full-length (1.6-kb) [32P]dCTP-labeledpak2+ cDNA and washed twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing the blots to Kodak XAR film with intensifying screens at −70 °C for 24 h. S. pombe cells were transformed with pREP3X-HA-Pak2 and grown overnight in leucine-deficient, thiamine-deficient liquid medium. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmNaF, 10 mm β-glycerol-phosphate, containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) using glass beads, and HA-tagged Pak2p was immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Babco). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and then once with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm unlabeled ATP and 5 μCi of [γ32P]ATP, 5 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma), with or without 10 μg of GTP-loaded Gst-Cdc42 (14Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of 6× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and then boiled for 5 min. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were either transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with 12CA5 or dried on Whatman 3 MM paper and autoradiographed using Kodak XAR film. Full-length wild-type and mutant pak2+ cDNAs were subcloned into the bait vector pEG202 (26Gyuris J. Golemis E.A. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant forms of S. pombe cdc42 cDNA were subcloned into the activation domain plasmid pJG4–5 (26Gyuris J. Golemis E.A. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). All cdc42 alleles encode a mutation (C189S) that eliminates the C-terminal prenylation site to promote nuclear entry and reduce toxicity (14Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Bait vectors, activation domain vectors, and a lacZ reporter were co-transformed into EGY48, and transformants were selected on dextrose-containing media lacking uracil, leucine, and histidine. Three independent colonies for each transfection were analyzed for reporter activation. The colonies were replica-plated to galactose-containing media to induce production of the bait protein, and the colonies were assayed for lacZactivity (19Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter R. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 155-159Google Scholar) and for growth on media lacking leucine. 10 ml of CHP428 cells transformed with pREP3X-Pak2 expression vectors were grown at 30 °C in leucine-deficient EMM, with or without 5 μm thiamine, to an OD of 1.0. The cells were collected, washed with water, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The cells were lysed on ice by vortexing with 400–500-μm acid-washed glass beads. Cell lysates were spun at 500 × g for 4 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were resuspended in the same volume of lysis buffer as the supernatants. The 500 × g supernatants were then spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were resuspended in the same volume of lysis buffer as the supernatants. Equal volumes of each fraction were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for immunoblot analysis. Thepak1+ gene was deleted in a CHP428/429 diploid as described previously (14Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), except that ahis7+ marker was used in place ofura4+. Diploids were then transformed with pREP3X encoding various forms of Pak1p or Pak2p as described under “Results.” The diploids were sporulated, and at least 10 tetrads were dissected for each construct. Spores isolated in this manner were scored for growth on YES media and on EMM media lacking histidine. Random spores, generated by glusulase treatment of tetrads, were also analyzed for growth on EMM media lacking histidine in the presence or absence of thiamine. pak1::his7 cells supported by pREP3X-based plasmids were tested for mating competence by plating to malt extract media with an h+ (CHP428) orh− strain (CHP429) of S. pombe. pak1+, pak2+, or CLA4, under the control of the thiamine-repressiblenmt1+ promoter, were introduced into S. pombe CH428 cells. To observe the growth of cells expressing these alleles, transformants were successively subcultured twice to selective plates minus thiamine. To observe the overexpression phenotype, 5-ml cultures were grown in EMM plus adenine in the presence of 15 μm thiamine to mid-log phase (OD ≈ 1) and washed twice with 5 ml of water. The cells were then resuspended in 5 ml at OD = 0.5 and grown to mid-log to late log phase (OD = 1–2). These cultures were diluted to OD = 0.2 and grown overnight two successive times. Final cultures ranged from early to late log phase (OD = 0.2–2). Cells were examined and photographed using an Olympus BH-2 (S. pombe) or a Leica Aristoplan (S. cerevisiae) microscope equipped with differential interference optics. Pictures were taken using Kodak TMAX 400 ASA film. During the course of cloning pak1+ from a S. pombe cDNA library (14Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we isolated a second,pak-like gene fragment. We were unable to obtain a full-length clone of this gene from this library, but the entire gene was subsequently sequenced as part of a comprehensive fission yeast genome sequencing effort. The sequence of the complete gene clearly indicates that it is a member of the PAK family; thus we have termed it pak2+ (Fig. 1 A). The pak2+ gene potentially encodes a protein of 589 amino acids. The domain structure of the predicted Pak2p protein closely resembles that of two S. cerevisiae proteins, Cla4p and Skm1p (2Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell. Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Like these molecules, the predicted Pak2p protein contains a PH domain at the N terminus, followed by a p21-binding domain, and a serine/threonine protein kinase domain that occupies the C-terminal half of the protein (Fig. 1 B). Unlike many other PAK homologs, S. pombe Pak2p does not contain an acid-rich region C-terminal to the p21-binding domain or notable proline-rich regions. Outside of the conserved PH, p21-binding, and kinase domains, Pak2p is not similar to any other members of the PAK family. To confirm that Pak2p is, in fact, a p21-activated kinase, we immunoprecipitated HA-tagged Pak2p from S. pombe that overexpress this protein. Pak2p immunoprecipitates were then assayed for protein kinase activity in the presence of GTP-loaded, wild-type Cdc42p; a constitutively active (V12) form; a dominant-negative (N17) form; or a control protein. Both wild-type and constitutively activate Cdc42p markedly stimulated Pak2p kinase activity, as reflected in increased phosphorylation of myelin basic protein in an in vitrokinase assay and in the generation of “upshifted” Pak2p bands on anti-HA immunoblot (Fig. 2). In contrast, dominant negative Cdc42p had no effect on basal kinase activity. These data confirm that Pak2p, like Pak1p and other members of the PAK family of protein kinases, can be activated by Cdc42p. To establish that the p21-binding domain in Pak2p is functional, we carried out interaction-trap assays (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1987: 20.0.1-20.1.28Google Scholar). Co-expression of LexA-Pak1p or LexA-Pak2p with activation domain-Cdc42p resulted in activation of thelacZ reporter (Table I) as well as LEU2 (not shown). These reporters were not activated when the yeast were grown on dextrose-containing media, which prevents induction of Cdc42p expression from the activation domain vector (not shown), or when a nonspecific bait (RBP7) was used and the yeast were grown on galactose-containing media (Table I). The interaction among Pak1p, Pak2p, and Cdc42p was greatly increased when a constitutively activated (V12) form of Cdc42p was used and abolished when an inactive (N17) (not shown) or an effector domain (A35) mutant was used. These results indicate that, like Pak1p, Pak2p can interact with Cdc42p within cells. Furthermore, the Pak2p/Cdc42p interaction is enhanced by mutations that activate Cdc42p and requires an intact effector domain. As with mammalian Pak1 (7Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), replacing two conserved histidine residues within the p21-binding domain of Pak2p ablates binding to Cdc42p. Neither a mutation that abolishes kinase activity nor deletion of the PH domain, however, measurably affects binding of Pak2p to Cdc42p in the interaction trap assay. In all cases, expression of both baits and interactors was confirmed by immunoblot (Fig. 3).Table IProtein complex formation detected by interaction trapLexA fusionaΔPH-Pak2, Pak2 lacking amino acids 1–125; Pak2 LL, Pak2 H136L,H140L; Pak2 KA, Pak2 K343A.β-Galactosidase activityCdc42Cdc42V12Cdc42V12,A35RBP4units/mlPak116.4 ± 2.455.0 ± 7.31.4 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.5Pak213.0 ± 2.948.7 ± 7.21.6 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.3ΔPH-Pak213.2 ± 2.046.2 ± 6.61.3 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.5Pak2 LL1.8 ± 0.51.6 ± 0.91.2 ± 0.51.8 ± 0.6Pak2 KA11.6 ± 2.744.7 ± 7.61.3 ± 0.31.1 ± 0.2RBP71.1 ± 0.31.3 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.5LexA fusion protein baits in pEG202 were co-transformed with the activation domain fusion vectors indicated to the right plus thelacZ reporter pSH18–34 into S. cerevisiae EGY48.

We and others have previously established that pak1+ is essential for viability and is likely to play a role in mating as well (14Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S.

To address the functions of the related pak2+ gene, we used the ura4+ marker to disrupt the coding sequence of one copy of this gene in diploid cells. After confirming the presence of the disrupted allele by Southern blot (not shown), the appropriate diploids were sporulated and tetrad dissections were carried out. Of 14 tetrads dissected, 12 gave rise to four viable colonies, while the remaining two yielded three colonies. Those tetrads that yielded four colonies displayed 2:2 segregation for uracil auxotrophy. These results indicate that pak2+ is not required for viability. Haploids containing the disruptedpak2+ allele were isolated and tested for growth rate at 20, 30, and 36 °C; viability under stress (e.g.post-heat shock, osmotic shock, nutrient-deprivation); morphology; and mating competence (not shown). None of these tests revealed a phenotype for pak2 disruption. To assess whetherpak2+ and pak1+ have overlapping functions, we first asked if high level expression ofpak2+ could allow cells to remain viable in the absence of pak1+.pak1+ /pak1::his7 diploids were transformed with a thiamine-regulated expression plasmid (pREP3X) bearing either no insert or various forms of fission yeastpak1+ or pak2+, or budding yeast CLA4. The cells were made to sporulate by plating on maltose, and the resulting tetrads were then dissected and plated to complete medium. Diploid cells transformed with the control vector gave rise to two viable and two dead spores (12 tetrads examined), as expected for disruption of an essential gene such aspak1+. Expression ofpak1+ from the pREP3X vector rescuedpak1:his7+ haploids; three or four spores germinated from most of the tetrads derived frompak1+ /pak1::his7+(pREP3X-pak1+) diploids, one or two of which bore the pak1::his7+ allele. That some spores failed to germinate can probably be attributed to the low copy number of the episomal expression vector pREP3X, which may not be present in sufficient numbers to distribute to all four spores.ΔN-pak1, which lacks the p21-binding domain and which we have previously shown to encode an unstable form of Pak1p (14Ottilie S.

We found that overexpression of pak2+ can also suppress the growth defect associated with loss ofpak1+ function (Fig. 4 B). Suppression was not evident when thiamine was included in the growth medium (which reduces expression from the pREP3X vector), indicating that viability in pak1Δ cells requires high levels ofpak2+ expression (data not shown). This conclusion is also supported by the finding that cells transformed with pREP81-pak2+, which has a mutated thiamine-responsive promoter that yields expression levels that are only about 1% of pREP3X-pak1+ (23Forsburg S.L.

In an attempt to develop antitumor drugs of greater potency and conspicuous biological specificity, we synthesized novel analogs based on the structure of PGA1. Of the newly synthesized analogs, 15-epi-Δ7-PGA1 methyl ester (NAG-0092), 12-iso-Δ7-PGA1 methyl ester (NAG-0093), and ent-Δ7-PGA1methyl ester (NAG-0022) possess a cross-conjugated dienone structure around the five-member ring with unnatural configurations at C(12) and/or C(15) and were found to be far more potent than native PGA1 in inhibiting cell growth and causing G1arrest in A172 human glioma cells. These three analogs induced the expression of p21 at both RNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Kinase assays with A172 cells treated with these analogs revealed that both cyclin A- and E-dependent kinase activities were markedly reduced, although cyclin D1-dependent kinase activity was unaffected. Immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis showed that the decrease in cyclin A-dependent kinase activity was due to an increased association of p21 with cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 complexes, whereas the decrease in cyclin E-dependent activity was due to a combined mechanism involving reduction in cyclin E protein itself and increased association of p21.

In order to develop more stable and potent PGA analogs, it appeared to be important to decipher the structural features contributing to the stability and antiproliferative activity of A type PGs. A type PGs are conjugated with glutathione in the cells, and the resultant PG-glutathiones are immediately exported from the cells through the ATP-dependent glutathione S conjugate export pump (MRP/GS-X pump) (12Suzuki M. Mori M. Niwa X. Hitara R. Furuta K. Ishikawa Y. Noyori R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2376-2385Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar), thereby reducing the intracellular accumulation of PGs. The GS-X pump was first reported to eliminate cytotoxic drugs from tumor cells and to play an important role in developing drug resistance in tumor cells (13Ishikawa T. Ali-Osman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20116-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is necessary to develop PGA1 analogs that are not readily conjugated with glutathione. We previously demonstrated that the cross-conjugated dienone PGs, including native Δ12-PGJ2 and an artificial analog Δ7-PGA1 methyl ester, reveal much more potent antiproliferative effects than simple enone-type PGs, such as PGA1 (12Suzuki M. Mori M. Niwa X. Hitara R. Furuta K. Ishikawa Y. Noyori R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2376-2385Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although PGs containing a cross-conjugated dienone structure still react reversibly with glutathione to form equilibrium mixtures of free PG and PG-glutathione conjugate in the cell, this reaction biased the equilibrium reaction with intracellular glutathione to the formation of enone-conjugated forms, accumulating free PGs in the cell (12Suzuki M. Mori M. Niwa X. Hitara R. Furuta K. Ishikawa Y. Noyori R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2376-2385Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, the eminent potency of dienone PGs over simple enone PGs may be explained by the difference in the extrusion mechanism. In accordance with this concept, we have demonstrated that the antiproliferative effect of Δ7-PGA1 methyl ester is significantly enhanced in the presence of an MRP/GS-X pump inhibitor. 2T.

In this study, we examined the ability of PGA1 analogs that contain a cross-conjugated dienone unit to inhibit the proliferation of A172 human glioma cells at molecular level. The results indicate that three analogs, 15-epi-Δ7-PGA1methyl ester (NAG-0092), 12-iso-Δ7-PGA1 methyl ester (NAG-0093), and ent-Δ7-PGA1 methyl ester (NAG-0022), are far more potent than native PGA1 in arresting cells at the G1 phase through a combined mechanism involving the induction of p21 and the suppression of cyclin E. PGA1, PGA2(Sigma), PGJ2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (Cayman Chemical Company), and PGA1 analogs were dissolved in absolute ethanol, and dilutions were made in Dulbecco's modified essential medium. The final concentration of ethanol did not exceed 0.1% or affect cell growth. All manipulations of these compounds were performed under low lighting conditions. The code names and chemical structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1. Detailed methods for the design and synthesis of PGA1 analogs are described elsewhere. 3M. Suzuki, T. Kiho, T.

Human glioma A172 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) under standard tissue culture conditions. Cell numbers were counted with a cell counter (Coulter). Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were harvested in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, washed once with PBS, and fixed in PBS containing 0.2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Fixed cells were washed once in PBS and permeabilized for 30 min with 0.2% Tween 20 and 1 mg/ml RNase A in PBS. Cells were then washed once in PBS and stained with 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide (Boehringer Mannheim). The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Coulter). Total cellular RNA was extracted from A172 cells using RNA isolation reagent (Isogen, Nippon Gene Co., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacture's instructions. RNA (20 μg of each) was denatured, separated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels, and transferred onto nylon membranes (Micron Separations, MA). p21 or cyclin E cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the hybridization signal was quantified by means of a Fuji Imaging Analyzer BAS-1500. GAPDH mRNA was used as an internal control for variations in loading and transfer efficiency among samples. For Western analysis, cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), and 1 mm sodium fluoride (NaF)) at 16 h after treatment with the PGA1 analogs. Total cell lysates (100 μg each) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. p21, cyclin A, and cyclin E proteins were detected with anti-p21, anti-cyclin A, and anti-cyclin E antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; H-164 for p21, H-432 for cyclin A, and C-19 for cyclin E), respectively, and protein signals were enhanced by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Twenty-four hours after treatment with PGA1 analogs, cells were lysed in IP-kinase buffer (HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 10 μmβ-glycerophosphate). Lysates were mixed with 10 μl of antibodies against cyclin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-432), cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-19), and cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-295). After 1 h of rotation at 4 °C, the immune complexes were precipitated with protein A beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The precipitated complexes were analyzed by Western blotting or assayed for kinase activity at 30 °C for 30 min in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm ATP, and 185 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (222 TBq/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). One microgram of histone H1 (for cyclin A- or E-dependent kinases) or 0.2 μg of GST-pRb (for cyclin D1-dependent kinases) was used as a substrate. The reaction products were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography and quantitated using a Fuji Image Analyzer BAS-1500. Statistical significance was determined by the analysis of variance. Scheffe's F test procedure for multiple pairwise post-hoc comparisons of means was implemented, and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures of the synthetic PGA1 analogs identified in this study as more potent antitumor compounds than native PGs. All of the analogs possess a cross-conjugated dienone unit and a methyl ester form at C(1), whereas native PGA1 and PGA2 are simple enone compounds and contain no methyl ester. Some of the synthetic PGs have unnatural configurations at C(12) and C(15). The synthetic PGA1 analogs were first tested for their ability to inhibit cell proliferation, using PGA1, PGA2, and PGJ2 as references. A172 cells (from a glioblastoma cell line) were treated with each of the test compounds at a 5 μm concentration, and changes in the cell number were examined over a period of 72 h. As shown in Fig. 2, NAG-0022, NAG-0092, and NAG-0093 were most potent in suppressing the proliferation of A172 cells at 48 and 72 h (p < 0.05). NAG-0026 also displayed a substantial antiproliferative activity (p< 0.05). PGA1, PGA2, and PGJ2 had almost no effect on the cell growth at 5 μm (Fig. 2 and data not shown). In order to examine the mechanism(s) of growth suppression by PGA1analogs and also to rule out the possibility of nonspecific cytotoxicity, we next determined the cell cycle distribution of A172 cells after treatment of these cells with the various PGA1analogs, using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Fig. 3). At a concentration of 5 μm, NAG-0022, NAG-0092, and NAG-0093 were most potent in arresting cells at the G1 phase (66.7, 74.9, and 71.0%, respectively) as compared with vehicle-treated cells (42.2%), whereas the other compounds showed only a modest effect on cell cycle distribution (Fig. 3 and data not shown). The growth inhibitory activity of the PGA1 analogs (Fig. 2) correlated well with their ability to cause G1 arrest (Fig. 3), suggesting that most of these analogs inhibit cell growth in this manner. It has been reported that PGA2 arrests the cell cycle at the G1 phase through the induction of p21 CKI at high concentrations (25–36 μm) (30Gorospe M. Liu Y. Xu Q. Chrest F.J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 42Hitomi M. Shu J. Strom D. Hiebert S.W. Harter M.L. Stacey D.W. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9376-9383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine whether this is also the case with PGA1 analogs, we examined changes in p21 expression after using the analogs to treat the A172 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the baseline level of p21 mRNA expression of these cells was low, and NAG-0022, NAG-0092, and NAG-0093 caused a dose-dependent increase in the steady-state mRNA level, with a clear-cut effect being observed at 1.0 μm and a maximal response at 5.0–10 μm (approximately 7-fold as compared with vehicle-treated cells). Only a modest increase in p21 mRNA was observed with NAG-0026, and PGA1, PGA2, and Δ12-PGJ2 had little or no effect at 5 μm (Fig. 4). The time course of the effect of NAG-0092 on p21 mRNA is shown in Fig. 5. Induction of p21 mRNA expression occurred as early as 2 h and reached a maximal level at 8 h after treatment with 5 μm NAG-0092. The induction of p21 protein was also examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 6, NAG-0092 and NAG-0093 at 5 μm markedly increased the protein level of p21, whereas PGA1 and PGA2 had only a modest effect. These results correlated well with those of Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). Taken together with the findings that PGA1 analogs did not induce the expression of other known CKIs, including p27, p57, p15, and p16 (data not shown), it is suggested that PGA1 analogs arrest the cell cycle at the G1 phase, at least in part through the induction of p21 CKI.Figure 6Induction of p21 protein by PGA1analogs in A172 cells. A172 cells were treated with the indicated compounds for 16 h and harvested in cell lysis buffer. The cell lysates (100 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. p21 protein was detected by Western blotting using anti-p21 antibody (at 1:1000 dilution).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further elucidate the mechanism(s) by which PGA1 analogs arrested the cell cycle at G1, we examined cyclin E-, A- and D1-dependent kinase activities, all of which are necessary for G1 progression and G1/S transition. As shown in Fig. 7 A, cyclin A- and E-dependent kinase activities were almost completely inhibited at 24 h after treatment with 5 μmNAG-0092, whereas cyclin D1-dependent kinase activity was not affected (data not shown). To determine whether the suppression of cyclin A- and E-dependent kinase activities by the PGA1analog was due to the induction of p21 and its association with the Cdk complexes, we analyzed cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes by IP-Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the amount of Cdk2 complexed with cyclin A did not change after treatment with PGA1 or NAG-0092. In contrast, the amount of p21 in the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex was markedly increased after treatment with NAG-0092, but only modest increases were noted with PGA1(Fig. 7 B). Taken together, the increased association of p21 with cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes appeared to be important for the inhibition of kinase activity. On the other hand, analysis of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes revealed that the amount of Cdk2 complexed with cyclin E was markedly reduced after treatment with NAG-0092 (Fig. 7 B). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that NAG-0092 at 5 μm caused a marked decline in the expression of cyclin E mRNA (Fig. 7 C), and Western blotting confirmed that NAG-0092 induced a decrease in the cyclin E protein level (Fig. 7 D). Although the level of cyclin E protein was markedly reduced after treatment with NAG-0092, the amount of p21 in the anti-cyclin E immunoprecipitates did not decrease (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that the relative amount of p21 complexed with cyclin E increased. It is likely, therefore, that the decrease in cyclin E-dependent kinase activity is due to a combined mechanism involving decline in cyclin E protein itself and increased p21 level in cyclin E complexes. Unexpectedly, cyclin E- but not cyclin A-dependent kinase activity was enhanced rather than suppressed by PGA1treatment (Fig. 7 A). Taken together with our observations that the amount of Cdk2 associated with cyclin E decreased after PGA1 treatment whereas that of p21 in the complexes remained constant (Fig. 7 B), it is conceivable that the relative amount of cyclin E-Cdk2-p21 ternary complexes was increased by PGA1. In light of the reported findings that p21 can promote the association of Cdk with cyclins and thus stabilize cyclin-Cdk complexes (43LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar), the apparent stimulation of cyclin E-dependent kinase activity by PGA1 may be explained by this novel function of p21 as an assembly factor rather than as a Cdk inhibitor. Interestingly, although cyclin E mRNA did not change after treatment with PGA1 (Fig. 7 C), the level of cyclin E protein was significantly reduced (Fig. 7 D), which may also be related to enhanced cyclin E-dependent kinase activity after PGA1 treatment. Recently, it was reported that cyclin E could be phosphorylated by Cdk2 and that phosphorylated cyclin E is readily degraded by ubiquitine-proteosome pathway (44Clurman B.E. Sheaff R.J. Thress K. Groudine M. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Therefore, enhanced cyclin E-Cdk2 activity may result in phosphorylation of cyclin E and its rapid degradation, leading to the reduction of cyclin E protein without changes in its mRNA level. In the present study, we tested a series of PGA1analogs for their activities in inhibiting the growth of A172 glioblastoma cells and found that three of these were far more potent than native PGA1, PGA2, and PGJ2. Although it has been reported that some PGs of the A and J series are capable of suppressing tumor cell growth both in vitro(2Sasaki H. Fukushima M.

Sci. 1993; 744: 161-165Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), their activities are rather modest, presumably due to their intracellular instability, necessitating the use of high doses to obtain substantial antitumor effects. We set out to develop PG analogs of the A and J series that show increased stability, because we considered that some of these compounds might prove to be more potent in inhibiting tumor cell growth than the native compounds. In parallel with this task, we attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which our novel analogs inhibit cell growth. There is accumulating evidence that active export of anticancer drugs from cells is one of the major mechanisms of drug resistance. Recent studies of the multidrug resistance phenotype of tumor cells have led to the discovery of P-glycoprotein, which mediates the efflux of anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and taxol (45Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 46Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12163-12166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, another type of drug transporter (GS-X/MRP pump) has been identified as a mediator of glutathione-associated drug resistance. It has been reported that A type PGs are effectively conjugated with glutathione in the cells (12Suzuki M. Mori M. Niwa X. Hitara R. Furuta K. Ishikawa Y. Noyori R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2376-2385Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that GS-X/MRP pump may play an important role in excluding the PGs from the cells. This concept was further supported by the observation that HL-60 cells overexpressing functional GS-X/MRP pump reveal far more resistance to the antiproliferative effect of Δ7-PGA1 methyl ester than control HL-60 cells. We have previously shown that the cross-conjugated dienone unit, as compared with the simple enone unit in native PGA, protects PGs against removal from the cytoplasm by GS-X/MRP pump (12Suzuki M. Mori M. Niwa X. Hitara R. Furuta K. Ishikawa Y. Noyori R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2376-2385Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and allows PGs to bind more stably to target proteins in the nucleus or cytosol, suggesting that the cross-conjugated dienone unit stabilizes PGs within the cell. However, in terms of clinical application, it was required to develop more stable and potent PGA1 analogs. Of the newly synthesized analogs that we synthesized, NAG-0092, NAG-0093 and NAG-0022, which showed the higher antiproliferative activity for A172 cells than NAG-0026 (Δ7-PGA1 methyl ester) (Figs. 1 and 2), possess both a hydroxy group at C(15) and a double bond at C(13)–C(14). Thus, the double bond and hydroxy group in the ω-chain are essential for the potent antiproliferative activities of PGs for these cells. The double bond is thought to fix the conformation of PGs, and the hydroxy group constitutes a hydrogen bonding, allowing sufficient interaction with the target molecule. Although native PGA2 has been reported to inhibit cell growth at 25–36 μm (30Gorospe M. Liu Y. Xu Q. Chrest F.J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 42Hitomi M. Shu J. Strom D. Hiebert S.W. Harter M.L. Stacey D.W. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9376-9383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 47Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 475-479PubMed Google Scholar), almost no growth inhibitory effect was observed at the lower concentrations (up to 10 μm) used in the current study. FACScan analysis revealed that PGA1 analogs arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase (Fig. 3). Interestingly, although NAG-0026 substantially inhibited cell growth, it did not cause accumulation of cells at G1 (data not shown), raising the possibility that growth inhibition by this particular analog may be due to its nonspecific toxicity. It has recently been reported that PGA2 inhibits the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activities through the induction of p21 (30Gorospe M. Liu Y. Xu Q. Chrest F.J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We showed by both Northern and Western blot analyses that the PGA1 analogs with the greatest ability to inhibit cell growth markedly induced the expression of p21 (Figs. 4 and6). Because p21 expression was induced within 2 h after treatment with PGA1 analogs (Fig. 5) and because the induction was enhanced in the presence of cycloheximide (data not shown), it is plausible that the induction of p21 expression resulted from the direct genomic action of the PGA1 analogs. Based on our analysis of cyclin-Cdk complexes and their activities, PGA1 analogs seem to inhibit tumor cell growth through two distinct mechanisms: the induction of p21 and the suppression of cyclin E expression (Fig. 7). Inactivation of cyclin A-Cdk2 activity by PGA1 analogs appears to occur mainly through the former mechanism, whereas suppression of cyclin E-Cdk2 activity appears to involve both increased p21 and reduced cyclin E expressions. Taken together with the findings that PGA1 analogs did not induce the expression of other known Cdk inhibitors or cyclins (data not shown), it is concluded that the combined effects on the expression of p21 and cyclin E are responsible for the growth suppressive function of PGA1 analogs. Although the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which PGA1 analogs induce p21 and suppress cyclin E expression remain elusive, the induction of p21 and the suppression of cyclin E by PGA1 analogs may involve a transcriptional mechanism because the PGA1 analogs are incorporated into nuclei without further metabolism (12Suzuki M. Mori M. Niwa X. Hitara R. Furuta K. Ishikawa Y. Noyori R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2376-2385Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Members of the J2 series of PGs have been reported to have a unique spectrum of biological effects, including the inhibition of cell cycle progression, the suppression of viral replication, and the stimulation of osteogenesis (11Fukushima M. Sasaki H. Fukushima S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 744: 161-165Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Results of previous studies have indicated that the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is mediated by metabolites of J type PGs (48Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar, 49Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.N. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). Although it has been demonstrated that PGA2 can also activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, its potency appears to be relatively weak (50Yu K. Bayona W. Kallen C.B. Harding H.P. Ravera C.P. McMahon G. Brown M. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23975-23983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In view of our present results that both PGJ2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, putative ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, are not effective in the induction of p21 expression in A172 cells, PGs of the A series are likely to serve as ligands for an as yet unidentified member(s) of the nuclear receptor superfamily distinct from peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. In conclusion, we have identified novel PGA1 analogs that strongly suppress cellular proliferation through their combined effects on p21 CKI and cyclin E. Our results may help to decipher the structural features essential to the antiproliferative activity of the A and J series of PGs. Although it remains to be determined whether the increased potency of our analogs reflects an increased stability within cells or an increased binding affinity to proteins, these analogs may prove to be powerful tools for elucidating the molecular functions of the A series of PGs in both in vitro and in vivostudies.

The high affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) is composed of three subunits, α, β, and γ, the latter being shared with the IL-4, -7, -9, and -15 receptors (1Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K. Ishii N.

Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Only the β and γ chains have been demonstrated to contain a long enough cytoplasmic region to transduce signals, the α subunit solely functioning as an affinity converter. Although the IL-2R does not contain intrinsic enzymatic activity, cell stimulation by IL-2 leads to an important and rapid increase of tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by non-receptor tyrosine kinases that are physically associated with the IL-2Rβ and -γ chains. It has been shown that the first steps of IL-2 signaling depend upon the activation of several tyrosine kinases of the Jak, Syk, and Src families (3Minami Y. Kono T. Yamada K. Kobayashi N.

Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The IL-2 receptor itself becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, which creates docking sites for a number of SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains containing signaling molecules (7Asao H. Takeshita T. Nakamura M. Nagata K. Sugamura K. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Asao H. Kumaki S. Takeshita T. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Among these, the adaptor protein Shc is recruited on a tyrosine residue located at position 338 of IL-2Rβ (9Ravichandran K.S.

Shc is then tyrosine-phosphorylated leading to the recruitment of the Grb2·Sos complex responsible for the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway via Ras (10Zhu X. Suen K.L. Barbacid M. Bolen J.B. Fargnoli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5518-5522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Grb2 is a signaling adaptor molecule composed of one SH2 and two SH3 domains, the latter mediating the constitutive association with Sos, the guanosine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras (11Chardin P.

IL-2 has also been reported to increase the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (12Merida I. Diez E. Gaulton G.N. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2202-2207PubMed Google Scholar, 13Augustine J.A.

PI3K activated in response to IL-2 is a type I PI3K composed of two subunits, a p85 regulatory subunit (p85) and a p110 catalytic subunit. p85 contains one SH3 domain, two proline-rich motifs, and two SH2 domains (16Escobedo J.A.

BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Through its multiple possibilities of protein-protein interactions, p85 is responsible for the recruitment of p110 to the membrane and its activation. The lipid kinase activity of PI3K leads to the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol on the D3 position of the inositol ring. PI3K was found to be critical for the transduction of anti-apoptotic and proliferative signals as it regulates Bcl-2 expression and c-Myc activation, possibly through a pathway involving Akt/PKB and p70S6 kinases (18Reif K.

PI3K activation appears to result from conformational changes induced either by the phosphorylation of p85 (20Cohen B. Yoakim M. Piwnica-Worms H. Roberts T.M. Schaffhausen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This type of association recruits PI3K to the membrane receptor complex, a required and sufficient event to mediate activation, as recently emphasized by the observation that direct targeting of p110 to the cell membrane results in constitutive activation of PI3K (24Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of activation of PI3K in response to IL-2 remains to be determined since p85 tyrosine phosphorylation is not seen in most cells, in particular in the Kit 225 cell line used in this study, and since the IL-2 receptor does not contain a YXXM motif suggesting the involvement of intermediary molecules. Adachi et al. (25Adachi M. Ishino M. Torigoe T. Minami Y. Matozaki T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Hinoda Y. Imai K.

SHP-2 (also called Syp, PTP1D, PTP2C, or SHPTP2) is a ubiquitously expressed 70–72-kDa cytosolic phosphatase that contains two SH2 domains in tandem (26Adachi M. Sekiya M. Miyachi T. Matsuno K.

The mechanisms of SHP-2 activation may be quite similar to those described for PI3K as they seem to involve either tyrosine phosphorylation (29Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) or SHP-2 association with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (30Lechleider R.J. Sugimoto S. Bennett A.M. Kashishian A.S.

SHP-2 has been described to transduce positive signals by binding directly to various receptor protein tyrosine kinases such as PDGF-, EGF-, or insulin receptors or to adaptor molecules such as IRS-1 or Grb2 leading to activation of Ras (32Bennett A.M.

IL-2-induced activation of SHP-2 was shown to be a Jak-independent mechanism probably mediated through Src kinases or a new type of kinase and is strictly dependent upon the expression of the IL-2Rβ and -γ chains (25Adachi M.

The identification of SHP-2-interacting proteins will be of interest in order to understand its function in IL-2 signaling and to identify potential downstream pathways. We recently reported that IL-2 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of the proto-oncogene product CrkL and regulates its association with p120Cbl and with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (35Gesbert F. Garbay C. Bertoglio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3986-3993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CrkL is a member of the Crk family, a group of SH2 and SH3 domains containing adaptor proteins, comprising the two splice products Crk-I and Crk-II and the product of a separate but related gene, CrkL (36Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 37Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell.

During the course of this previous study we observed a p97–100-kDa protein associated with CrkL and phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to IL-2. In this report, we demonstrate that pp97 phosphoprotein participates in the formation of a multimolecular complex containing the signaling molecules CrkL, Grb2, SHP-2, and the PI3K regulatory p85 subunit. pp97 is one of the major early tyrosine kinase substrates in IL-2 signaling, and it directly associates with CrkL, p85, and SHP-2 through their respective SH2 domains. We also provide evidence that pp97 mediates the interaction between p85 and SHP-2 that occurs in response to IL-2. Given its characteristic features, as described here, it is possible that pp97 may be related to phosphoproteins that display similar molecular mass and migration properties and that have been recently described. Indeed, three independent reports have described 97- and 100-kDa phosphoproteins in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells or in response to M-CSF or IL-3 (39Carlberg K. Rohrschneider L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15943-15950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Gu H. Griffin J.D. Neel B.G. J. Biol.

Similar to the pp97 described in our study, these phosphoproteins directly associate with SHP-2 and p85. The apparently central role of pp97 in the formation of a large and unique complex containing CrkL, SHP-2, and PI3K suggests that pp97 might exert an important function at the crossroad of three major signaling pathways triggered by IL-2. The human T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived, IL-2-dependent Kit 225 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. T. Hori (Kyoto University, Japan (42Hori T. Uchiyama T. Tsudo M. Umadome H. Ohno H. Fukuhara S. Kita K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 70: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Cells were maintained in culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics) supplemented with 0.5 nmrecombinant human IL-2 (generously provided by P. Ferrara, Sanofi, France). Kit 225 cells were deprived of IL-2 by washing three times and resuspending the cells in culture medium without IL-2 at 5 × 105/ml for 48 h. For stimulation, IL-2-deprived Kit 225 cells were resuspended in culture medium at 2 × 107/ml and incubated at 37 °C without (control) or with 1 nm recombinant IL-2 for various periods as specified. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed at 5 × 107 ml in cold 0.5% Triton lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmvanadate, and 5 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). Lysis was performed for 30 min on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from volunteer anonymous healthy donors. Mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. Non-adherent lymphocytes were stimulated with 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin for 3–5 days and further expanded for 4 days in presence of 1 nm IL-2. T-cell blasts were then washed 3 times in order to remove IL-2 and incubated 18 h at 37 °C in culture medium without IL-2. T-cell blasts were stimulated and lysed as described above for Kit 225 cells. Polyclonal antibodies against Cbl (Sc-170), Grb2 (Sc-422, used for immunoprecipitation), IL-2Rβ (Sc-1240), and CrkL (Sc-319) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to Grb2 (G 16720, used in Western blot) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-p85 antiserum (06-195) and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-SHP2 sera were kind gifts from J. C. Cambier (National Jewish Institute, Denver, CO) and A. Kazlauskas (Schepens Eye Research Institute, Boston, MA). A polyclonal antibody was also raised in the laboratory against a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal half (amino acid residues 1 to 343) of human p85α. Isoform-specific antisera directed against p110 were a kind gift from S. Roche (CNRS EP612, Montpellier, France). The monoclonal anti-GST antibody was raised and purified in the laboratory. The Tyr-317 phosphopeptide (PSpYVNVPD) derived from the human Shc protein was provided by C. Garbay (INSERM Unit 266, Paris, France). The Tyr-740 phosphopeptide (GGpYMDMSKDESID) derived from the PDGF receptor was synthesized by Genosys. Endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F mix was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Cell lysates (2.5 to 5 × 107 cell equivalent) were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads. 1–10 μg of antibodies were added to the lysates. After 2 h of rocking at 4 °C, 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were added, and incubation was continued for an additional 45 min. Immunoprecipitates were washed 5 times with cold lysis buffer, boiled in 2× Laemmli Sample Buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Immunodepletion experiments were performed by three successive rounds of immunoprecipitation using protein G-Sepharose beads-adsorbed antibodies, followed by one round with beads alone, and the final immunoprecipitation was performed on the supernatants as described above. For immunoblotting the PVDF membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with either 5% non-fat dry milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.5% Tween (TBS-T). Filters were washed 4 times in TBS-T and incubated for 1.5 h with optimal concentrations of primary antibodies diluted in TBS, 0.1% Tween. Following 4 additional washes in TBS-T, the filters were further incubated for 45 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (sheep anti-mouse Ig from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or goat anti-rabbit Ig from Dako). Visualization was performed using Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL reagents and autoradiographic films. A plasmid encoding for GST-Grb2 full-length fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. P.-O. Couraud (ICGM, Paris, France) and was used as a template to amplify the Grb2-SH2 domain in a BamHI-EcoRI-linearized PGEX-4T. For this purpose we used the following pair of primers: AGA CGG ATC CAT GAA ACC ACA TCC GTG GTT T (sense) and AGA CGA ATT CTC AGA CGT ATG TCG GCT GCT GTG G (antisense). GST-CrkL constructs (CrkL full-length, SH2, and SH3N) were a kind gift from B. J. Druker (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). Plasmids encoding for the SHP-2 SH2 (N-terminal, C-terminal, and tandem) were kindly provided by J. C. Cambier. GST-Grb3–3, a naturally occurring form of Grb2 containing a nonfunctional SH2 domain, was provided by Rhone Poulenc Rorer. GST-p85 full-length protein and domains were constructed as follows. The cDNA for human p85α was oligo(dT) reverse-transcribed and amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the pair of primers CCG GAT CCA TGA GTG CTG AGG GGT A (sense) and CGG AAT TCT CAT CGC CTC TGC TGT GC (antisense) and cloned in theBamHI-EcoRI sites of PGEX-4T. The various p85 subdomains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and appropriate fragments were cloned into PGEX vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to yield fusion proteins containing the SH3 domain (GST-SH3, amino acid residues 1–83), the BCR homology domain framed by the two proline-rich regions (GST-PBP, residues 73–336), and the two SH2-containing C-terminal half of p85 (GST-SH2(N + C), residues 313–724). The primers and insertion sites are as follows. SH3 was inserted betweenBamHI-EcoRI sites of PGEX-4T (sense primer CCG GAT CCA TGA GTG CTG AGG GGT A, antisense primer CCG AAT TCA CGA GAT TTT TTT CCT TCC A); the PBP domain was inserted between theBamHI and EcoRI sites of PGEX4T (sense primer TAG CGC GGA TCC TAC GTA GAA TAT ATT GGA AGG, antisense primer CCG AAT TCA TCC CCA GTA CCA TTC AGC A); the SH2 (N + C) was inserted between theBamHI and EcoRI sites of PGEX-2T (sense primer CCG GAT CCA AAC CTA CTA CTG TAG CC, antisense primer CGG AAT TCT CAT CGC CTC TGC TGT GC). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were produced and purified as described previously (43Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). 5–10 μg of purified GST fusion proteins were adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Precleared lysates were rocked with coupled beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 5 times with lysis buffer, boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and bound proteins analyzed by Western blotting as described under “Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting.” Proteins were immunoprecipitated, separated, and transferred to PVDF membrane as described above. A first incubation of the membrane was performed with 5 nm of indicated fusion proteins in TBS, 0.1% Tween, 3% bovine serum albumin for 1.5 h. The membrane was washed 4 times and incubated with a monoclonal anti-GST antibody for 1.5 h. After 4 washes the membrane was further incubated 45 min with an anti-mouse antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Vizualization was performed using Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL reagents and autoradiography. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from 5 × 107 cells and washed four times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling 5 min in 20 μl of phosphate buffer, 0.5% SDS (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2; 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol). Eluates were diluted in 80 μl of digestion buffer (50 mmsodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.6 unit of endoglycosidase F) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Reaction was stopped by adding 1 volume of Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling 5 min. We have previously described the IL-2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL in T lymphocytes and its association with the proto-oncogene product Cbl and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (35Gesbert F. Garbay C. Bertoglio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3986-3993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CrkL also associated with several unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins including a relatively faint band at 70–72 kDa, an 85-kDa protein that is constitutively phosphorylated in Kit 225 cells, and a major IL-2-inducible signal at 97–100 kDa. As shown in Fig. 1 A pp97 is one of the major phosphoproteins coprecipitated with CrkL and p85 in an IL-2-dependent manner. pp97 is also present in Grb2 immunoprecipitates from IL-2-stimulated cell lysates, albeit at a lower intensity than in p85 immunoprecipitates. The p70–72-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein detected in p85 and Grb-2 immunoprecipitates (also observed in CrkL immunoprecipitates upon longer exposure) was formally identified as the cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 with a specific anti-SHP-2 antiserum. By using the same antibody we demonstrated that pp97 was also coprecipitated with SHP-2 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7 and 8). Upon IL-2 stimulation, p85 and Grb2 become detectable in SHP-2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A, lower panels, lanes 7 and 8). As reported recently, and probably due to a very low stoichiometry of the complexes described, CrkL was not detectable in any co-immunoprecipitation experiment (35Gesbert F. Garbay C. Bertoglio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3986-3993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, SHP-2 immunoblotting revealed two specific bands coprecipitated with p85, whereas only the slower migrating species was detected in association with Grb2. Comparison of the anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and SHP-2 immunoblots indicated that the slower migrating band corresponded to the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of SHP-2, whereas the faster migrating band was not tyrosine-phosphorylated and represented the major band revealed in SHP-2 immunoprecipitates. It is worth noticing that the amount of phosphorylated SHP-2, as seen by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting, is of similar intensity in SHP-2, p85, and Grb2 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that the majority, if not all, of phosphorylated SHP-2 associates with p85 and Grb2. In order to exclude the possibility that pp97 phosphorylation may represent a unique feature in Kit 225 cells we also evidenced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85-associated pp97 in human T-cell blasts in response to IL-2 (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were also obtained in the NKL cell line, a human IL-2-dependent natural killer cell line (not shown). As shown in the various co-immunoprecipitations and specific Western blot experiments performed, IL-2 stimulation thus induces the association of four important signaling molecules, namely p85, SHP-2, Grb2, and CrkL. The presence of pp97 in all these immunoprecipitates led us to investigate a possible adaptor function of this unidentified molecule. We further studied the kinetics of phosphorylation of pp97 associated with p85 and SHP-2 in response to IL-2. As shown in Fig. 2 A, pp97 becomes detectable by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting in p85 and SHP-2 immunoprecipitates as soon as 30 s following IL-2 stimulation of Kit 225 cells. After 2 min of stimulation pp97 displays a slower migration profile and is detected as a higher molecular weight protein, whereas its level of tyrosine phosphorylation decreases steadily but remains detectable after 60 min of stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2 A, pp97 appears to be the main common tyrosine-phosphorylated protein associated with p85 and SHP-2 in IL-2-stimulated cell lysates. Control blots with anti-p85 or anti-SHP-2 (not shown) confirmed the equal loading of all lanes, and also evidenced, as illustrated above in Fig. 1 A, that p85 was associated with both a tyrosine-phosphorylated form and a non-phosphorylated form of SHP-2. This result suggests that p85, which is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in IL-2-stimulated human T lymphocytes, may interact indirectly with SHP-2, and the presence of pp97 in both types of immunoprecipitates suggests that pp97 might function as an intermediary molecule between these two proteins. To analyze further these interactions, GST fusion proteins containing the various domains of p85 and SHP-2 were used in pull-down experiments from IL-2-stimulated cell lysates (Fig. 2 B). pp97 was easily detected using the p85(N + C)SH2 construct but did not bind to either p85 SH3 or p85 proline-rich region (PBP). It is not clear why in these experiments pp97 binding to the full-length construct appeared rather weak. This may be due to steric hindrance or conformational factors of the full-length protein that would favor interaction with the p85 tandem SH2 in vitro in the absence of the other p85 domains. In addition, another phosphoprotein, with a broad migration between 75 and 80 kDa also bound GST-p85(N + C)SH2 as well as GST-p85 and was formally identified as the IL-2Rβ chain by specific Western blotting (Fig. 2 B, left panel). As observed on this figure the presence of IL-2Rβ does not correlate with the level of pp97 indicating that IL-2Rβ is not likely to mediate the interaction between pp97 and p85. Conversely, pp97 probably does not represent the missing adaptor protein that should link p85 to the IL-2R. In agreement with our previously published data, the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein detected in the p85-SH3 pull-down was identified as p120Cbl (not shown). On the other hand, pp97 also associated with SHP-2 SH2 domains, and this interaction appears to require that both domains be present in tandem in the GST protein, as either SH2 domain alone was quite inefficient. Two additional phosphoproteins are detected that bind to SHP-2 SH2 and remain to be identified. Since it has been suggested that p85 may be present in cells in molar excess to the p110 catalytic subunit, and may thus exist as a free form, we investigated whether pp97 could be associated with p85·p110 complexes. To address this question, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with specific anti-p110α and β antibodies (Fig. 3). pp97 was clearly detected in association with both p110α and p110β, which indeed coprecipitated p85. This result demonstrates that pp97 associates with p85·p110 complexes and might therefore function in the regulation of PI3K activity by IL-2. The SH2-mediated interactions described above were further characterized by peptide competition assays in either p85 or SHP-2 immunoprecipitates. A phosphorylated tyrosine 740-containing peptide (YMDM) derived from the PDGF receptor, which competes with the p85-SH2 domains, was used in p85 or SHP-2 immunoprecipitates. A phosphorylated tyrosine 317-containing peptide derived from Shc (YVNV), which competes with the Grb2 SH2, provided a specificity control in these experiments. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the PDGF-"
https://openalex.org/W1989675462,"Cyclic AMP stimulates insulin gene transcription through a cAMP response element (CRE). In the present study the insulin CRE-binding proteins and their functions were investigated. A mutational analysis of nuclear protein binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assays in combination with specific antisera showed that in the CRE of the rat insulin I gene the imperfect CRE octamer-like sequence TGACGTCC interacts weakly with CREB and overlaps with two sequence motifs (TTGTTGAC and CCAAT) that bind winged helix-like proteins and the transcription factor NF-Y, respectively. Transient transfection of wild-type and mutant insulin CRE-reporter fusion genes and the inactivation of cellular CREB or NF-Y by overexpression of the dominant negative mutants KCREB or NF-YA29, respectively, indicate that cAMP inducibility of the insulin CRE is mediated by CREB or closely related proteins; however, NF-Y binding to the insulin CRE confers constitutive, basal activity and decreases the ability of CREB to mediate cAMP-stimulated transcription and calcium responsiveness. Results from these studies demonstrate that NF-Y binds to the insulin CRE and modulates the function of CREB. Together with the nonpalindromic sequence of the CRE octamer motif, the interaction of NF-Y with CREB may be responsible for the gene-specific transcriptional activity of the insulin CRE and explain why it has considerable basal activity but is less responsive to cAMP stimulation than others."
https://openalex.org/W2011121202,"Ca2+ current potentiation by conditioning depolarization is a general mechanism by which excitable cells can control the level of Ca2+ entry during repetitive depolarizations. Several types of Ca2+ channels are sensitive to conditioning depolarization, however, using clearly distinguishable mechanisms. In the case of L-type Ca2+ channels, prepulse-induced current facilitation can only be recorded when the pore-forming α1C subunit is coexpressed with the auxiliary β1, β3, or β4, but not β2, subunit. These four β subunits are composed of two conserved domains surrounded by central, N-terminal, and C-terminal variable regions. Using different deleted and chimeric forms of the β1 and β2subunits, we have mapped essential sequences for L-type Ca2+ channel facilitation. A first sequence, located in the second conserved domain of all β subunits, is responsible for the promotion of current facilitation by the β subunit. A second sequence of 16 amino acids, located on the N-terminal tail of the β2 subunit, induces a transferable block ofL-type current facilitation. Site-specific mutations reveal the essential inhibitory role played by three positive charges on this segment. The lack of prepulse-induced current facilitation recorded with some truncated forms of the β2 subunit suggests the existence of an additional inhibitory sequence in the β2subunit.

Beyond their role in membrane excitability, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are of particular interest due to the fundamental importance of the biological processes regulated by incoming Ca2+ ions (for review, see Ref. 1McCleskey E.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Several different types of Ca2+ channel have been identified in neurons, where they are crucial for secretion, synaptic transmission, or gene expression (2Tsien R.W. Lipscombe D. Madison D.V. Bley K.R. Fox A.P. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 431-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 3Snutch T.P. Reiner P.B. Curr. Opin.

Ca2+ entry through L-, N-, T-, or P-type channels is primarily regulated by the level of membrane depolarization. However, the frequency of these depolarizations is also an important regulatory factor that has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic transmission and that may be of importance for long-term potentiation. Accordingly, repetitive stimuli or strong pre-depolarization can up-regulate the activity of different types of Ca2+ channel, giving rise to the so-called Ca2+current facilitation (for review, see Ref. 5Dolphin A.C. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although a similar increase is recorded for the various Ca2+ channels, different mechanisms, however, have been proposed. Experimental evidence firmly correlates a given mechanism with a particular Ca2+ channel type, as is the case for N-type Ca2+ channels, which are sensitive to a direct, voltage-dependent G-protein block. L-type Ca2+ channel facilitation has been described using various preparations, and different mechanisms leading to current potentiation have been proposed. Strong pre-depolarizations can induce a change in gating mode in cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels, whereas the same protocol appears to lead, in skeletal and vascular muscle, to a voltage-dependent phosphorylation of the channel by protein kinase A and calmodulin kinase II, respectively (6Johnson B.D.

At the molecular level, these effects seem to be related to different isoforms of the L-type Ca2+ channel (α1C, α1D, or α1S), different splice variants, and/or different cellular preparations. Current facilitation of the neuronalL-type Ca2+ channel (9Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Bourinet E. Charnet P. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P.

Nargeot J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting a specific mechanism for neuronal facilitation. As opposed to N-type Ca2+channels, coexpression of specific β subunits (β1, β3, or β4) is absolutely necessary for the development of α1C subunit facilitation (12Bourinet E. Charnet P. Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1996; 431: 771-774PubMed Google Scholar) and the insensitivity to G-protein stimulation or inhibition (12Bourinet E. Charnet P. Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) are also distinctive features. Altogether, these data suggest that the molecular mechanisms of L- and N-type Ca2+ channel facilitation are different processes. In this work, using deleted and chimeric subunits constructed from permissive and nonpermissive β subunits, we demonstrate the existence of a conserved sequence in the β subunits necessary for L-type Ca2+ channel facilitation. We also identify a short autoinhibitory segment on the N-terminal tail of the β2 subunit partly responsible for the insensitivity of the α1C + β2 subunit combination to prepulse facilitation. Expression of individual β subunits could therefore reveal latent properties that are central for neuronal plasticity. The following calcium channel subunits were used: α1C and α2-δ (9Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Bourinet E. Charnet P. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), β1b (20Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1792-1797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these subunit cDNAs were inserted into the pMT2 expression vector under the control of an SV40 promoter (9Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Bourinet E. Charnet P. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). β1-TF1–4 and β2-TF1–4 were constructed by PCR. 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate). The sense primer was engineered to possess an EcoRI site and a start codon (boldface) when necessary. In the reverse primer, an XbaI site (preceded by a stop codon in the case of the TF4 subunits) was added at the 5′-end. Numbers in parentheses correspond to the position of the primer in the sequence. GenBankTM accession numbers were X61394 for the β1b subunit and M80545 for the β2a subunit. The primers used were as follows: β1-TF1: sense, EcoRI-ATG-(235–257 β1b), and antisense, XbaI-(1837–1857 β1b); β1-TF2: sense,EcoRI-ATG-(559–579 β1b), and antisense, identical to β1-TF1; β1-TF3: sense, EcoRI-ATG-(706–726 β1b), and antisense, identical to β1-TF1; β1-TF4: sense, EcoRI-(64–84 β1b), and antisense,XbaI-TCA-(1298–1317 β1b); β2-TF1: sense, EcoRI-ATG-(424–444 β2a), and antisense,XbaI-TCA-(2168–2190 β2a); β2-TF2: sense, EcoRI-ATG-(748–769 β2a), and antisense, identical to β2-TF1; β2-TF3: sense,EcoRI-ATG-(1009–1031 β2a), and antisense, identical to β2-TF1; and β2-TF4: sense, EcoRI-(115–133 β2a), and antisense,XbaI-TCA-(1600–1623 β2a). The PCR product was checked and purified on agarose gel. The chimeras were obtained by a PCR strategy as described (22Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar) using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). The N-terminal fragments were amplified using the following primers: βCH1: sense, identical to β2-TF4, and antisense, (559–576 β1b + 731–747 β2a); βCH2: sense, identical to β2-TF4, and antisense, (706–723 β1b + 878–894 β2a); βCH3: sense, identical to β2-TF4, and antisense, (706–724 β1b+ 993–1008 β2a); and βCH4: sense, identical to β2-TF4; and antisense, (235–249 β1b + 409–423 β2a). The C-terminal fragments were amplified using the following primers: βCH1: sense, (731–747 β2a+ 559–576 β1b), and antisense, identical to β1-TF1; βCH2: sense, (878–894 β2a + 706–723 β1b), and antisense, identical to β1-TF1; βCH3: sense, (993–1008 β2a + 706–724 β1b), and antisense, identical to β1-TF1; βCH4: sense, (407–423 β2a + 235–249 β1b), and antisense, identical to β1-TF1. All PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel, cut out, and purified. A second PCR was performed using these products to produce the final chimeras. β-Subunit truncated forms and chimeras were finally digested using EcoRI and XbaI, subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) for sequencing (DiDeoxy Terminator technology, Applied Biosystems) and in vitro translation (TNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate systems, Promega), and subsequently into pMT2 for injection and expression. The mutants β2M123 and β1/β2-CH4M123 were obtained by a PCR strategy as described (22Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar) using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system. The N-terminal fragments were amplified using the following primers: β2M123 and β2/β1-CH4M123: sense, identical to β2-TF4, and antisense, 5′-GGACACCCGTACTGCCGCGGCATGTACCAGCCCG-3′ ((388–420 β2a), excepted the mutated sequence is underlined), using β2 as a matrix. The C-terminal fragments were amplified using the following primers: β2M123: sense, 5′-GGGCTGGTACATGCCGCGGCAGTACGGGTGTCC-3′ (388–420 β2a, excepted mutated sequence underlined), and antisense, identical to β2-TF1, using β2 as a matrix; and β2/β1-CH4M123: sense, identical to β2M123, and antisense, identical to β1-TF1, using β2/β1-CH4 as a matrix. The complete sequence was obtained as described for chimeras. All the constructions of the β subunits used in this paper were checked for correct translation and molecular weight by in vitro translation using the T7 or T3 TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). All these constructions were able to increase Ba2+ current amplitude when co-injected with the α1C subunit, demonstrating association with the α1C subunit (respective current amplitudes for α1C alone, −368 ± 48 nA (n = 5); for β1, β1-TF1, β1-TF2, β1-TF3, and β1-TF4, −813 ± 306 nA (n = 20), −702 ± 235 nA (n = 6), −687 ± 273 nA (n = 14), −757 ± 414 nA (n = 10), and −411 ± 100 nA (n = 5), respectively; for β2, β2-TF1, β2-TF2, β2-TF3, and β2-TF4, −815 ± 403 nA (n = 9), −1220 ± 440 nA (n = 11), −1035 ± 399 nA (n = 17), −527 ± 200 nA (n = 5), and −1447 ± 678 nA (n = 6), respectively; and for β2/β1-CH1, β2/β1-CH2, β2/β1-CH3, and β2/β1-CH4, −930 ± 424 nA (n = 8), −1200 ± 540 nA (n = 9), −1633 ± 823 nA (n = 3), and −1650 ± 644 nA (n = 18), respectively). α1CΔN and α1CΔC were generated by PCR using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). An N-terminal fragment was generated to introduce the untranslated avian myeloblastosis virus sequence just before the sequence of the α1C subunit (the antisense primers used were 5′-CCTCGTGTTTTCATTGACCATGGTGGAAGTATTTGAAAGAAA-3′ for α1CΔC (nucleotides 290–310; GenBankTM accession number M67515), and 5′-GCAGCTGCATTGGCATTCATGGTGGAAGTATTTGAAAGAAA-3′ for α1CΔN (nucleotides 377–396)). This fragment was then used as a megaprimer to generate the final mutated forms of α1C with an antisense primer (5′-GTTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCG TACAGGCCTCCAGCCCTCCTGAAGATGTC-3′ for α1CΔC (NotI, stop codon in boldface, nucleotides 5378–5404) and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCCTACAGGTTGCTGACATAGGACC-3′ for α1CΔN (NotI, nucleotides 6699–6721)). The mutated forms were subcloned into the pMT2 expression vector. Xenopus oocyte preparation and injection (5–10 nl of α1 + α2-δ + β subunit cDNAs at ≈0.3 ng/nl) were performed as described elsewhere (13Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 771-774PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were then incubated for 2–7 days at 19 °C under gentle agitation before recording. Whole cell Ba2+currents were recorded under two-electrode voltage clamp using the GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Current and voltage electrodes (<1 megaohms) were filled with 2.8m CsCl and 10 mm BAPTA, pH 7.2, with CsOH. Ba2+ current recordings were performed after injection of BAPTA (one or two 40–70-ms injection at 1 bar of 100 mmBAPTA-free acid (Sigma), 10 mm CsOH, and 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.2). The recording solution had the following composition: 10 mm BaOH, 20 mm tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide, 50 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 mm CsOH, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with methanesulfonic acid. Only oocytes expressing Ba2+ currents with amplitudes in the range of 0.5–5 μA were analyzed to ensure sufficient resolution and to avoid voltage-clamp problems. Currents were filtered and digitized using a DMA-Tecmar Labmaster and subsequently stored on an IPC 486 personal computer using pClamp software (Version 6.02, Axon Instruments, Inc.). Ba2+ currents were recorded during a typical test pulse from −80 to +10 mV of 0.4-s duration. Current facilitation was elicited by applying a 200- or 400-ms depolarization (pre-depolarization) to +60 to +140 mV, 50 ms prior the test pulse. Current amplitudes were measured using Clampfit (pClamp Version 6.02, Axon Instruments, Inc.). Facilitation was quantified by dividing the current amplitude recorded after pre-depolarization by the control current amplitude (without pre-depolarization). All values are presented as means ± S.D. The significance of the difference between two means was tested using Student's t test (p < 0.05). We have previously shown that the activity of the α1C subunit L-type Ca2+ channel, recorded during a single voltage step at +10 mV, could be up-regulated by applying strong positive pre-depolarizations (12Bourinet E. Charnet P. Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This type of current facilitation was sensitive to the expression of a β subunit (12Bourinet E. Charnet P. Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but was not affected by the omission of the α2-δ subunit. We have further identified the existence of permissive and nonpermissive β subunits for this facilitation (13Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 771-774PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that application of a +120-mV pre-depolarization to an oocyte expressing the α1C and β1 subunits (see protocol shown on top of the figure) increases the Ba2+ current recorded during a subsequent depolarization (in the range of −20 to +30 mV). The same pre-depolarization was without effect when applied to oocytes expressing the α1C and β2 subunits (Fig. 1 A). This lack of facilitation was recorded independently of the amplitude of the test pulse, as exemplified for voltage steps from −20 to +30 mV (Fig. 1, A and B). It was not due to a β2 subunit-induced shift in the voltage dependence of facilitation since stronger (or longer) pre-depolarizations were also inefficient in producing α1C + β2subunit current potentiation (13Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 771-774PubMed Google Scholar). Given that the α1Csubunit, when expressed alone, was not sensitive to pre-depolarization, we concluded that the β1, β3, or β4 subunit carried specific sequences able to produce novel properties when expressed with the α1C subunit. We used the β2 subunit sequence as a matrix for chimeric β subunits to identify these sequences. The four β subunit genes identified so far are organized in two conserved domains (C1 and C2, 60–80% homology; white boxes in Fig. 2 A), surrounded by variable regions where homology is lower (V1–3;black boxes) (see also Ref. 23Perez Reyes E. Schneider T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The sequence responsible for the interaction with the α1 subunit (the β subunit interaction domain) has been localized to the second conserved domain (C2; see arrow in Fig. 2 A), and recent studies suggest that important deletions outside this region have only slight effects on the capacity of this subunit to affect calcium channel function (24De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Keeping these results in mind, we constructed and expressed a series of N- and C-terminal deletions of the β1 and β2 subunits in which this β subunit interaction domain was preserved and four chimeric β subunits, between the permissive β1 and nonpermissive β2 subunits, in which each of the five domains was exchanged (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 3 shows the effects of N- and C-terminal deletions of the β1 subunit on current facilitation. Prepulse facilitation was elicited using a 200-ms-long prepulse at +100 mV. Under these conditions, the average current potentiation recorded by expressing the full-length β1subunit with the α1C subunit was 47 ± 18% (n = 17) larger than the control current, recorded without pre-depolarization. Deletion of the first variable region (V1, first 58 amino acids, β1-TF1) of the β1subunit did not affect its capacity to induce facilitation since the increase in current recorded after the pre-depolarization was 54 ± 16% (n = 5) (Fig. 3). Subsequent deletions of the N-terminal region of the β1 subunit including the first conserved domain and the second variable region (first 166 and 215 amino acids, respectively; β1-TF2 and β1-TF3) were also without effect on facilitation (respective increases of 66 ± 6% (n = 7) and 48 ± 9% (n = 9)) (Fig. 3). In all cases, the increase in current following pre-depolarization was accompanied by an acceleration of inactivation, as already noted for class CL-type Ca2+ channel facilitation (12Bourinet E. Charnet P. Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similarly, the C-terminal deletion of the last variable domain (amino acids 418–597) (Fig. 2) produced a truncated β1 subunit that was able, when expressed with the α1C subunit, to generate Ca2+ channels sensitive to pre-depolarization (43 ± 13% (n = 5) of current increase; seetrace labeled β1-TF4 in Fig. 3). Altogether, these data suggested that the sequences necessary to induceL-type current facilitation are located in the second conserved domain of the β1 subunit (C2, amino acids 215–418). Since this domain is highly conserved between the β1 and β2 subunits (92% homology), the β2 subunit should also be able to produce facilitation. Under these conditions, the lack of facilitation recorded with the β2 subunit may be due to some inhibitory processes instead of a missing facilitatory sequence. We have tested this idea by constructing a series of four truncated β2 subunits. In β2-TF1, the first 16 amino acids of the β2 subunit were removed. As shown in Fig. 4, Ba2+ currents recorded from oocytes expressing this subunit with the α1C subunit were not sensitive to pre-depolarization since their amplitude was not increased by the conditioning voltage step (5 ± 2%,n = 11). The subsequent deletion of the first conserved domain (C1) gave rise to β2-TF2 (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, application of pre-depolarization to oocytes injected with this subunit, in conjunction with the α1C subunit, significantly increased the Ba2+ current recorded during a subsequent test pulse to +10 mV (38 ± 6% (n = 8) compared with 5 ± 6% (n = 9) for the full-length β2 subunit). The facilitated current displayed the typical inactivating phase usually recorded with this paradigm (comparetraces labeled β2-TF2 in Fig. 4 and β1 in Fig. 1). A larger deletion including the central variable region V3 (amino acids 1–212, β2-TF3 in Fig. 4) had the same effect and transformed this subunit into a permissive subunit for facilitation (average increase of 42 ± 13%,n = 3). Deletion of V3, the C-terminal variable sequence of the β2 subunit (amino acids 416–604, β2-TF4 in Fig. 4), however, had no effect, and currents recorded with or without pre-depolarization were almost indistinguishable (7 ± 3%, n = 6). The voltage dependence of facilitation of these truncated subunits was characterized by using depolarization in the range of +60 to +140 mV. Such depolarizations induced an increase in Ba2+ currents recorded during a subsequent test pulse for α1C subunit Ca2+ channels containing β1, β1-TF1, β1-TF3, or β2-TF2. As shown in Fig. 5 (A andB) for typical recordings, this increase rose with the amplitude of the conditioning depolarization, reaching a plateau for amplitude greater than +100 mV. The voltage dependence of this increase was similar for all these constructions (e fold changes for β1, β1-TF1, β1-TF3, and β2-TF2 were 45 ± 12 mV (n = 3), 23 ± 15 mV (n = 4), 52 ± 26 mV (n = 5), and 47 ± 27 (n = 3), respectively). Depolarization of the same amplitude was, however, without effect when the α1C subunit was expressed with either β2 or β2-TF4 (Fig. 5 B). The induction of facilitation by deletions of the N-terminal tail (V1 + C1 domains) of the β2 subunit strongly suggests (i) the existence of a conserved facilitatory sequence in the C2 domain of the β subunit, able to induce facilitation by both the β1and β2 subunits and (ii) the presence, in the full-length β2 subunit, of an inhibitory sequence located in the first 128 amino acids. To test this hypothesis more directly, we constructed four chimeras based on the N-terminal truncated β1 subunits β1-TF1, β1-TF2, and β1-TF3, which were all able to induce facilitation (Fig. 3). The results are shown in Fig. 6. The average facilitation, recorded using the standard protocol, was 47 and 5% for the β1and β2 subunits, respectively (Figs. 3, 4, and 6). In the first construct, the missing sequence of β1-TF3 (V1 + C1 + V2 domains) was replaced with the corresponding sequence of the β2 subunit (amino acids 1–212) (Fig. 2). Expression of this β2/β1-CH3 chimera with the α1C subunit prevented the promotion of facilitation normally recorded with β1-TF3 (9 ± 1%,n = 3) (Fig. 6). The lack of facilitation recorded with the β2 subunit can therefore be transferred to the β1 subunit by addition of these amino acids, which confirmed the existence of an inhibitory sequence. In β2/β1-CH2, β2/β1-CH1, and β2/β1-CH4, the contribution of the β2 subunit to the total sequence of the chimera was further reduced. β2/β1-CH2 was deleted of an insert specifically found in the V2 domain of the β2subunit (amino acids 170–212, black box in Fig. 6). β2/β1-CH1 and β2/β1-CH4 kept only the V1 + C1 and V1 sequences, respectively, from the β2 subunit, with the remaining sequence coming from the β1 subunit (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 6, none of these constructs was able to promote current facilitation in response to pre-depolarization. The extreme case is the β2/β1-CH4 chimera, where addition of the first 16 amino acids of β2 to β1 was able to completely block current facilitation (4 ± 5%, n = 10; not significantly different from the β2 subunit; see bottom of Fig. 6), suggesting that an inhibitory sequence was indeed present in these few amino acids.Figure 6L-type current facilitation recorded with chimeras between the β1 and β2 subunits. The same recording conditions were used as those described in the legend to Fig. 3, but using chimeras between β subunits. Left panel, chimeric β subunits used; middle panel, current traces (scale bars = 1 μA); right panel, averaged facilitation, quantified as the ratio of the current amplitude with pre-depolarization divided by the control current amplitude.

The sequence is characterized by the presence of a short stretch of positively charged amino acids (boldface letters). To test the possible involvement of these charges in the inhibition of facilitation, we mutated these three arginines of the β2/β1-CH4 chimera to alanines. The mutated subunit, β2/β1-CH4M123, was then coexpressed with the α1C subunit. As shown in Fig. 7, Ba2+ currents recorded from oocytes expressing this combination of mutated subunits could be increased by the application of conditioning depolarization (28 ± 5%, n = 7), reversing the effect of the insertion of the N-terminal tail of the β2 subunit (compare traces recorded with the non-mutated and mutated β2/β1-CH4 chimeras in Fig. 7; difference was statistically significant). Although facilitation was a property specifically carried by the β subunit, participation of the α1 subunit appeared also to be essential since this type of current potentiation was recorded only with the α1C pore-forming subunit. In a first attempt to identify critical amino acids of the α1C subunit involved in this regulation, we constructed two deletions in the α1C subunit that have been reported to increase Ca2+ current amplitude (25Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wei X. Neely A. Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): A128Google Scholar). α1CΔN had its first 29 amino acids removed, corresponding to the deletion made in the rabbit α1C subunit (first 60 amino acids) (26Wei X. Neely A. Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): A128Google Scholar). Similarly, α1CΔC had a deletion of amino acids 1706–2143, corresponding to deletion of the homologous residues 1733–2171 of the rabbit subunit (25Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our prediction was that these sequences could be involved in a tonic block of the Ca2+channel activity that could be relieved either by deletion (25Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wei X. Neely A. Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): A128Google Scholar) or by voltage-dependent interactions with β subunits, thus inducing current facilitation. We thus expressed these two truncated forms of the α1C subunit with either the β1or β2 subunit and tested their capacity to respond to conditioning pre-depolarization (Fig. 8). As expected, the amplitudes of the Ba2+ currents recorded with both α1CΔN and α1CΔC were systematically larger than those recorded with the full-length α1C subunit (data not shown). However, deletion in neither the N-terminal nor C-terminal tail affected the response of these subunits to pre-depolarizations with the β1 or β2 subunit. Respective increases in Ba2+current recorded with the β1 and β2subunits were 80 ± 30% (n = 9) and 11 ± 11% (n = 11) for α1CΔN and 63 ± 36% (n = 3) and 11 ± 3% (n = 2) (9 and 14%) for α1CΔC. We therefore conclude that these two sequences, despite their role in modulating current amplitude, were not directly involved in the regulation of α1C subunit voltage-dependent facilitation. Our results show that neuronal L-type Ca2+ channel facilitation can be promoted or blocked by distinct short sequences of the ancillary β subunit. The lack of effect of acute injection of okadaic acid, the insensitivity to incoming Ca2+ ions (12Bourinet E. Charnet P. Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the requirement for permissive β1 β3, and β4 subunits (13Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 771-774PubMed Google Scholar) clearly distinguished this type of facilitation from L-type facilitations previously characterized in cardiac, skeletal, and vascular cells (6–8,14–18) and suggest that different underlying mechanisms are involved. The presence or absence of these different types of facilitation with related L-type Ca2+ channels, such as, for example, the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel, may depend not only on the type of auxiliary subunit associated with the α1 subunit in a particular cell type, but also on specific kinase activities (6Johnson B.D.

Penner R. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 496: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Adachi-Akahane S. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 435-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) or syntaxine (for the N-type Ca2+ channel) (30Stanley E.F. Mirotznik R.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). All of these elements have been shown to be crucial for the normal development of specific forms of facilitation. Our results, however, emphasize the importance of the auxiliary β subunits for neuronal L-type facilitation and can explain the diversity of the response of the same α1Csubunit to conditioning depolarizations when recorded in cardiac and neuronal cells. Differentially spliced variants of the β2subunit have been described in rat, rabbit, and human (23Perez Reyes E. Schneider T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). At least three display important variations in their N-terminal V1 domains, suggesting that functional differences regardingL-type Ca2+ channel facilitation may exist. One consequence of the differential expression of these splicing variants could therefore be to finely tune the level of Ca2+entry during sustained or repetitive depolarizations. Although we have previously noted the importance of normal protein kinase A activity for facilitation (12Bourinet E. Charnet P. Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a mechanism involving voltage-dependent phosphorylation of the channel as a key step for the promotion of facilitation can be disregarded for the following reasons. First, we have demonstrated that ATPγS, AMP-PCP, and okadaic acid cannot stabilize or preventL-type Ca2+ channel facilitation (12Bourinet E. Charnet P. Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Second, facilitation can be recorded on expression of the β1subunit, but not the β2/β1-CH4 chimera, which retains the putative protein kinase A and C phosphorylation sites present in the β1 subunit (and of course in the α1C subunit). Third, cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels, which are highly sensitive to protein kinase A phosphorylation (31Pelzer D. Pelzer S. McDonald T.F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 107-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are completely resistant to this type of voltage-dependent facilitation (13Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 771-774PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these data suggest that facilitation requires a phosphorylated α1Csubunit, but do not support the existence of a voltage-dependent phosphorylation step, as described in skeletal muscle (7Sculptoreanu A. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), in the pathway leading to current potentiation. We have mapped two distinct regions in the sequence of the Ca2+ channel β subunit as critical for the promotion and inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channel facilitation (Fig. 9). The promoting sequence, localized in the C2 domain of β1, appears to be conserved on the four β subunits, as shown by the capability of β3 and β4 (12Bourinet E. Charnet P. Tomlinson W.J. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 771-774PubMed Google Scholar) and β2-TF2 (this work) to promote facilitation. This domain contains the β subunit interaction domain identified by De Waard et al.(32De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12056-12064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and shown to be responsible for the β subunit-induced regulation of Ca2+ channel properties. Facilitation is, however, the first property demonstrated to be carried out by the β subunit, although it appears to be specific to the α1C subunit. This suggests that the molecular consequences of β subunit binding are specific among the α1 subunits. Among possible molecular mechanisms of facilitation, we have excluded the involvement of a voltage-dependent block of the channel by the amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails of the α1C subunit, although their deletions have been shown to increase the L-type current amplitude (25Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another mechanism could be a prepulse-induced reactivation of inactivated channels since the same sequence that is shown here to block facilitation has already been shown to block voltage-dependent inactivation (33Olcese R. Qin N. Schneider T. Neely A. Wei X. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1433-1438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Whether or not the three arginine residues that we have mutated and the chimeras used in this work also affect inactivation remains to be determined. Further experiments to test the effects of these on channel inactivation will be useful in clarifying this issue. The inhibitory sequence is found only in the β2 subunit. The lack of current facilitation produced by coexpression of the β2/β1-CH4 chimera suggests that specific interactions with the first few amino acids of the β2subunit are important for the mechanism by which facilitation is blocked. Furthermore, the abolition of the effect by the mutation of the three arginines located in this short sequence suggests that electrostatic interactions may be of importance for this inhibition. The absence of facilitation recorded with β2-TF1 is worth noting and could also suggest the existence of another inhibitory sequence within the C1 domain of the β2 subunit. At this point, however, we are not able to precisely locate the inhibitory binding site(s) of these sequences on the α1C or β2 subunit. On-going experiments, using chimeras between α1 subunits permissive and nonpermissive for facilitation, should allow us to further define this binding site and to precisely determine the molecular mechanism of this form of neuronal L-type current facilitation. Whether the same sequences of the β2 subunit are also important for other types of Ca2+ channel facilitation, such as G-protein-dependent N-type Ca2+ channel facilitation, remains to be determined.

Additional genetic data suggest that Shk2, like Cdc42 and Shk1, participates in Ras-dependent morphological control and mating response pathways in fission yeast. We also show that overexpression of byr2, a gene encoding a Ste11/MAPK kinase kinase homolog, suppresses the mating defect of cells partially defective for Shk1 function, providing evidence of a link between PAKs and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in fission yeast.

The cdc42 gene has been highly conserved through evolution and encodes a small GTPase belonging to the Rho family of Ras-related guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (1Chant J. Stowers L.

A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Until recently, the cellular functions of Cdc42 proteins were unknown. However, recent studies from a variety of model systems have provided substantial insights into Cdc42 function. In mammalian cells, Cdc42 and a related GTPase, Rac, have been shown to participate in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle control, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAK, p21cdc42/rac-activated protein kinase; WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; THP, TrcHis peptide; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LBD, LexA DNA binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activating domain; GBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAK, p21cdc42/rac-activated protein kinase; WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; THP, TrcHis peptide; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LBD, LexA DNA binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activating domain; GBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain.cascades (1Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Hotchin N.A. Hall A. Cancer Surveys. 1996; 27: 311-322PubMed Google Scholar). At least two types of proteins have been implicated as effectors for Cdc42 in mammalian cells. The first are members of a recently elucidated family of protein kinases referred to as p21cdc42/rac-activated kinases, or PAKs (9Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). PAKs, like Cdc42, are conserved from yeasts to mammals and are activated by Cdc42 and Rac GTPases but not by other small GTPases, such as Ras and Rho. In a recent study, evidence was provided that p65PAK(α-Pak/Pak1) is required for Cdc42-induced activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase cascade, but not for Cdc42-induced cytoskeletal remodeling or DNA synthesis (10Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenström P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). PAKs induce c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase activation in vitro (11Polverino A. Frost J. Yang P. Hutchison M. Neiman A.M. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26067-26070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), so it would appear that they are likely mediators of Cdc42-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase activation in vivo. In another recent study, it was shown that dominant-activated mutants of α-Pak/Pak1 induce dissolution of actin stress fibers and reorganization of focal complexes (13Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a role for PAKs in cytoskeletal regulation is likely, although the exact nature of this function is, at present, unclear. A second putative Cdc42 effector in mammalian cells is the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, or WASP (14Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar,15Kolluri R. Tolias K.F. Carpenter C.L. Rosen F.S. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5615-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). WASP binds to Cdc42, but not to Rac or Rho GTPases (14Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). WASP is highly enriched in polymerized actin (14Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), and T lymphocytes from patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an immunodeficiency disease, exhibit highly aberrant cytoskeletal organization (15Kolluri R.

Thus, WASP is likely to mediate at least part of the cytoskeletal regulatory functions of Cdc42.Substantial insights into the function and regulation of Cdc42 GTPases have come from studies using yeast model systems. In the budding yeastS. cerevisiae, Cdc42 is required for activation of a mating pheromone-induced MAPK cascade and for proper bud site selection, a process involving reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (1Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 16Simon M.N. De Virgilio C. Souza B. Pringle J.R. Abo A. Reed S.I. Nature. 1995; 376: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Cdc42 is also required for induction of the filamentous growth phase ofS. cerevisiae, a process that involves some, but not all, of the components of the pheromone signaling pathway, as well as Ras protein function (17Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 18Mosch H.U. Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and perhaps a third, Skm1 (24Martin H. Mendoza A. Rodriguezpachon J.M. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), are probable effectors for Cdc42 in S. cerevisiae. Ste20 and Cla4 are partially redundant in function. S. cerevisiae mutants deleted of thecla4 gene are morphologically aberrant (23Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) but mating-competent, while ste20 null mutants are sterile and defective in filamentous growth induction (19Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 20Ramer S.W. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Mutants deleted of both STE20 and CLA4 are inviable and cannot undergo cytokinesis (23Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Thus, Ste20 and Cla4 share at least one essential cellular function. While skm1 null mutants are viable and exhibit no obvious phenotypic defects, overexpression ofskm1 leads to aberrant cell morphology, suggesting a role for the Skm1 protein in morphological regulation (24Martin H. Mendoza A. Rodriguezpachon J.M. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).The fission yeast S. pombe possesses a single knowncdc42 gene, which is essential for cell viability (5Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Wild type fission yeast cells are rod-shaped, whereas cdc42 null cells are spheroidal in morphology and exhibit mislocalization of actin (5Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This phenotype suggests a role for Cdc42 in cytoskeletal regulation. Chang et al. (25Chang E.C. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H.P. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) showed that Cdc42 participates in a Ras-mediated morphological control pathway in S. pombe. These investigators provided genetic and biochemical evidence that Cdc42 and Ras1, the single known S. pombe Ras homolog, are part of a complex of interacting proteins that includes the putative Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Scd1 and Scd2, an SH3 domain-containing protein of unknown function. Scd1 and Scd2 are homologous to Cdc24 and Bem1, respectively, which have been shown to regulate Cdc42 function in S. cerevisiae (1Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Previously, we provided evidence that a Ste20/PAK homolog, Shk1 (also known as Pak1 (26Ottilie S. Miller P.J.

Furthermore, overexpression of shk1partially suppresses the mating defect of S. pombe mutants expressing a dominant negative mutant allele of cdc42 (27Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Like Cdc42, Shk1 is also linked to Ras function in S. pombe. Overexpression of dominant negative forms of shk1 results in inhibition of Ras-dependent mating responses (26Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C.L. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L.

In addition, cooverexpression of shk1 and skb1, a gene we recently described that encodes a second putative Shk1 regulator, restores elongate morphology to S. pombe ras1null mutants (28Gilbreth M. Yang P.R. Wang D. Frost J. Polverino A. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These various data suggest that Shk1 is a key mediator of the Ras1/Cdc42 signaling complex in S. pombe.In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization ofshk2, a novel gene encoding a second Ste20/PAK-related protein kinase in S. pombe. Shk2 is more closely related in structure to the S. cerevisiae PAKs Cla4 and Skm1 than to other known yeast and metazoan PAKs. We provide evidence for physical and functional interaction between Shk2 and Cdc42 and for involvement of Shk2 in Ras1/Cdc42-mediated morphological control and mating response pathways. We show that Shk2 is not essential for viability, normal morphology, or mating in S. pombe and provide evidence that its functions substantially overlap with those of Shk1, with Shk1 being the dominant protein in function. We also provide genetic evidence corroborating a role for Shk1 in MAPK cascade-dependent mating response in S. pombe. Finally, we show that, despite the structural relatedness of the two proteins, Shk2 cannot substitute for Cla4 in budding yeast, suggesting that Shk2 and Cla4 are not functional homologs.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have described the cloning and characterization of shk2, a gene encoding a novel PAK in the fission yeast,S. pombe. Our results suggest that Shk2, like the previously described fission yeast PAK Shk1 (26Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C.L. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), participates in Ras- and Cdc42-dependent morphological control and mating response pathways. While shk2 deletion mutants exhibit no obvious defects in growth, morphology, or mating, overexpression ofshk2 restores viability and elongate morphology to theS. pombe shk1 null mutant. Overexpression of shk2does not restore full mating competence to the shk1 null mutant. These results suggest that Shk1 and Shk2 may be partially redundant, with Shk1 being the dominant protein in function. We cannot rule out the possibility that an additional Shk2-related PAK exists inS. pombe. However, from our PCR-based cloning approach, which utilized degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on the S. cerevisiae Ste20 protein sequence, we identified only theshk1 and shk2 genes.Results of previous studies by us and others provided evidence for involvement of Shk1 in the S. pombe mating response pathway. First, overexpression of a catalytically defective mutant of Shk1 inhibited mating of S. pombe cells (26Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C.L. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Second, overexpression of the N-terminal regulatory domain of Shk1 attenuated the hypersexual response of S. pombe cells expressing the dominant activated ras1(G17V) mutant (27Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of shk1 partially bypassed the mating defect of S. pombe cells expressing the dominant inhibitorycdc42(T17N) allele (27Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown thatS. pombe cells deleted of shk1 but overexpressingshk2 exhibit a significant mating defect. Furthermore, we have shown that this defect can be largely suppressed by overexpression of the MAPK kinase kinase Byr2 and, additionally, that overexpression of shk2 partially bypasses the mating defect of S. pombe cells expressing the dominant inhibitorycdc42(T17N) allele. Our results corroborate a role for Shk1 in the S. pombe mating response pathway, which was suggested in previous studies (26Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C.L. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, our results suggest that, with regard to mating responses, Byr2 acts downstream from the Shk kinases. Our results provide the first direct genetic evidence linking PAKs to regulation of a MAPK module S. pombe. A homolog of Byr2, Ste11, has been similarly implicated as a downstream target for the Shk1 homolog Ste20 in S. cerevisiae (19Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 47Wu C. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Although our results suggest that Shk1 function is dominant over that of Shk2, it is possible that Shk2 is required for cellular functions for which we have not assayed. Interestingly, the R3 subdomains of Shk1 and Shk2 lack any discernible structural homology. It is possible that these domains might specify unique molecular functions for each kinase. Further insights into Shk2 function and perhaps PAK functions in general may be gained by conducting genetic screens for S. pombe mutants that are synthetically lethal with theshk2 null mutation.In both S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, PAKs are required not only for mating responses but also for essential cellular functions unrelated to mating. The specific nature of these essential functions has yet to be defined in either yeast. S. cerevisiae possesses three PAK-encoding genes. Two of these,STE20 and CLA4, are partially overlapping in function (23Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The third, Skm1, is completely dispensable (24Martin H. Mendoza A. Rodriguezpachon J.M. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Deletion of STE20 results in sterility (19Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 20Ramer S.W. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), while deletion of CLA4 results in aberrant morphology (23Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, deletion of both CLA4 and STE20 genes is lethal (23Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). PAK wiring is clearly different in S. pombe, in which a single PAK, Shk1, has essential functions not shared by other PAKs (26Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Creasy C.L. Sells M.A. Bagrodia S. Forsburg S.L. Chernoff J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5908-5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6180-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These differences are not surprising, given that fact that S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are a half billion years diverged in evolution (45Sipiczki M. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 431-452Crossref Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the essential functions of PAKs in S. pombe andS. cerevisiae are conserved in higher organisms or, for that matter, between the two distantly related yeasts.Note Added in ProofThe shk2 gene has been cloned independently by Sells et al. (Sells, M. A., Barratt, J. T., Caviston, J., Ottilie, S., Lebever, E., and Chernoff, J. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273,18490–18498), who named the genepak2.Their results are consistent with and complement the results presented in this paper. The cdc42 gene has been highly conserved through evolution and encodes a small GTPase belonging to the Rho family of Ras-related guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (1Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Hotchin N.A. Hall A.

Biol. 1990; 111: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) andSchizosaccharomyces pombe (5Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell.

A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Until recently, the cellular functions of Cdc42 proteins were unknown. However, recent studies from a variety of model systems have provided substantial insights into Cdc42 function. In mammalian cells, Cdc42 and a related GTPase, Rac, have been shown to participate in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle control, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAK, p21cdc42/rac-activated protein kinase; WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; THP, TrcHis peptide; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LBD, LexA DNA binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activating domain; GBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAK, p21cdc42/rac-activated protein kinase; WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; THP, TrcHis peptide; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LBD, LexA DNA binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activating domain; GBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain.cascades (1Chant J.

Hall A. Cancer Surveys. 1996; 27: 311-322PubMed Google Scholar). At least two types of proteins have been implicated as effectors for Cdc42 in mammalian cells. The first are members of a recently elucidated family of protein kinases referred to as p21cdc42/rac-activated kinases, or PAKs (9Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). PAKs, like Cdc42, are conserved from yeasts to mammals and are activated by Cdc42 and Rac GTPases but not by other small GTPases, such as Ras and Rho. In a recent study, evidence was provided that p65PAK(α-Pak/Pak1) is required for Cdc42-induced activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase cascade, but not for Cdc42-induced cytoskeletal remodeling or DNA synthesis (10Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenström P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). PAKs induce c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase activation in vitro (11Polverino A. Frost J. Yang P. Hutchison M. Neiman A.M. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26067-26070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), so it would appear that they are likely mediators of Cdc42-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase activation in vivo. In another recent study, it was shown that dominant-activated mutants of α-Pak/Pak1 induce dissolution of actin stress fibers and reorganization of focal complexes (13Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a role for PAKs in cytoskeletal regulation is likely, although the exact nature of this function is, at present, unclear. A second putative Cdc42 effector in mammalian cells is the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, or WASP (14Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A.

We have randomly mutagenized theVMA4 gene in order to examine the structure and function of the 27-kDa subunit. Cells lacking a functional VMA4 gene are unable to grow at pH > 7 or in elevated concentrations of CaCl2. Plasmid-borne, mutagenized vma4 genes were screened for failure to complement these phenotypes. Mutants producing Vma4 proteins detectable by immunoblot were selected; one (vma4–1ts) is temperature conditional, exhibiting the Vma− phenotype only at elevated temperature (37 °C). Sequencing revealed that a single point mutation, D145G, was responsible for the phenotypes of thevma4-1ts allele. The unassembled 27-kDa subunit made in the vma4-1tscells is rapidly degraded, particularly at 37 °C, but can be protected from degradation by prior assembly into the V-ATPase complex. In purified vacuolar vesicles from the mutant cells, the peripheral subunits are localized to the vacuolar membrane at decreased levels and a comparably decreased level of ATPase activity (14% of the activity in wild-type vesicles) is observed. When vma4-1tsmutant cells are shifted to pH 7.5 medium at 37 °C, the cells become enlarged and exhibit multiple large buds, elongated buds, and other abnormal morphologies, together with delocalization of actin and chitin, within 4 h.

Even though the yeast Vma− growth phenotype has been used in screening for mutants showing defects in vacuolar acidification (8Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Oluwatosin Y.E. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1534-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanism for the growth arrest of yeast cells at elevated pH or in high concentrations of CaCl2 is still not known. The cell division cycle (CDC) of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae involves several sequential morphogenetic events before cytokinesis, including formation of a ring of chitin (the “bud scar”) at the site of the previous budding events, and concentration of patches of actin filaments at the bud site (17Chant J. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel. 1991; 1: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). During bud formation, the location of the pre-bud site is specified by the mating type of the cell and the site of the previous cytokinesis, and the cell polarity is maintained during bud growth. A very large number of genes have been identified that affect progression of these morphological changes with the cell cycle. Cells with defects in either CDC42 or CDC24 genes, which are essential for the establishment for cell polarity, lose the asymmetric location of actin filaments and the cell is arrested as large, round, unbudded cell (18Adams A.E. Johnson D.I. Longnecker R.M. Sloat B.F. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 19Sloat B.F. Adams A. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). During the pre-bud site assembly, the actin rearrangement is triggered by the activations of CDC28 andCLNs (20Lew D.J. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mutant cells defective in CDC3, CDC10, CDC11, or CDC12 are unable to complete cytokinesis but undergo multiple cycles of budding, DNA synthesis, and nuclear division. The buds formed in these mutants are abnormally elongated (21Adams A.E. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). There are also indications that alterations in cytoplasmic pH may be linked to the cell cycle. Some plasma membrane H+-ATPase (pma1) mutants fail to complete bud enlargement and cytokinesis, and the cells accumulate nucleated small buds (22McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A significant change in cytoplasmic pH has been demonstrated during the early part of the cell cycle (23Gillies R.J. Ugurbil K. den Hollander J.A. Shulman R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2125-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), so the ATPase-mediated regulation of internal pH may play a central role in regulating cell division. The VMA4 gene encodes the 27-kDa E subunit of the peripheral (V1) sector of the yeast vacuolar ATPase (24Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18554-18560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Null mutants (vma4Δ) revealed that the 27-kDa subunit is essential for the assembly and activity of the vacuolar ATPase (15Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nullvma4 mutants are viable, but exhibit a typical Vma− phenotype (24Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18554-18560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuolar membranes prepared from thevma4Δ mutants lacked the 69-, 60-, 42-kDa and other peripheral subunits, whereas a significant portion of the 100-kDa subunit (and/or the 75-kDa breakdown product) was still present on the vacuolar membrane (15Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the 27-kDa subunit is required for stable assembly of the V1 sector onto the vacuolar membrane. Tomashek et al. (25Tomashek J.J. Graham L.A. Hutchins M.U. Stevens T.H. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26787-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) demonstrated that stability of the Vma4 protein depended on the presence of the VMA10gene product and that the VMA4 and VMA10 gene products could be cross-linked, suggesting that these two V1 subunits may interact as part of a “stalk” in the V-ATPase. In this study, we have randomly mutagenized the VMA4gene in order to study the structure and function of the 27-kDa subunit. One of the mutants (vma4-1ts) is temperature sensitive, and only shows the Vma− phenotype at 37 °C. The 27-kDa subunit was made in this mutant, but rapidly degraded at the non-permissive temperature. Assembly of the mutant 27-kDa subunit into V-ATPase complexes protected it from degradation and the assembled complexes showed ATPase activity. When thevma4-1ts cells were shifted to medium buffered to pH > 7 at 37 °C, the cells show abnormal bud morphologies and the delocalization of actin and chitin, suggesting the growth arrest ofvma4-1ts at elevated pH may result from the defects in secretion and polarized growth. These experimental results reveal a possible connection between the vacuolar ATPase, bud formation, and polarized growth during the cell division cycle of budding yeast that could be mediated by intracellular pH or Ca2+ changes. Zymolyase 100T and Tran35S-label were purchased from ICN. Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) was obtained from Pierce. Rhodamine-phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes, and calcofluor white and DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) were purchased from Sigma. Enzymes for molecular biology were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim and New England Biolabs; Sequenase was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The yeast strain SF838-1D (genotype: MATα, ade6, leu2-3, leu2-112, ura3-52, pep4-3, gal2) (26Stevens T.H. Rothman J.H. Payne G.S. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was used as wild-type in all experiments, except vacuole preparation for which SF838-5A (genotype:MATα, ade6, leu2-3, leu2-112, ura3-52, gal2) (26Stevens T.H. Rothman J.H. Payne G.S. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was used. Yeast media were prepared as described previously (10Yamashiro C.T.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 177-186Google Scholar) except that 50 mm MES and 50 mm MOPS were used to buffer YEPD (yeast extract-peptone-2% dextrose medium) to pH 7.5 when the medium contained 60 mm CaCl2. A 1.8-kilobaseBamHI fragment, containing the 699-base pair open reading frame of the VMA4 gene, was cloned into the pRS315 shuttle vector (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the BamHI site to generate plasmid pVMA4. ABglII site was introduced into the VMA4 gene at nucleotide 688 of the open reading frame. The deletion plasmid (pJW2) was constructed by replacing the 650-base pairHindIII-BglII fragment within the VMA4open reading frame with a 1.1-kilobase URA3 gene fragments from YEp24 vector digested at the ClaI and SmaI sites. The resulting plasmid was linearized with BamHI, and the vma4Δ::URA3 allele was integrated into the VMA4 locus of both wild-type strains, replacing theVMA4 gene by one-step gene disruption (29Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar), to give deletion strains SF838-5Aα vma4Δ and SF838-1Dαvma4Δ. Deletion of VMA4 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction of chromosomal DNA prepared from yeast cells (30Nasmyth K.A. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), using primers: 5′-TAGGTATACAAGCTGCTG and 5′-TTTCGGCCGACTTGTCCCTCGTTGCT. DNA sequencing was performed using a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and the dideoxy chain termination method using the same primers (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). The plasmid pvma4-1 (consisting of the pVMA4 plasmid with the D145G mutation in the VMA4 gene) was isolated from a yeast strain expressing the temperature conditional Vma− phenotype after screening as described below. A strain containing thevma4-1ts allele integrated at theVMA4 locus (JWY1) was generated by a two-step gene replacement (32Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The vma4-1ts allele was cut from the pRS315 vector with XhoI and SacII and then ligated to integrating vector pRS305 (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) digested withSalI and SacII to form plasmid pJW6. pJW6 was digested with SphI to linearize the plasmid. SF838-5Aαvma4Δ cells were transformed with the digested plasmid, and integrants were selected by growth on supplemented minimal medium lacking leucine. The integrants were then grown non-selectively (on YEPD, pH 5.0 at 25 °C), and cells that became auxotrophic for uracil were identified by growth on plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (27Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 177-186Google Scholar). Integration of the vma4-1ts allele at the VMA4 locus to generate strain JWY1 (with loss of thevma4Δ::URA3 allele) were confirmed by the presence of a fragment of the appropriate size by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA, followed by sequencing of this polymerase chain reaction fragment. The strain overproducing thevma4-1ts allele (JWY1/2μ-vma4-1ts) was generated by first cloning the BamHI fragment containing the vma4-1tsallele from pRS315 into YEp24 which had been digested with BamHI to form plasmid 2μ-vma4-1ts, and then transforming the JWY1 strain with this plasmid and selecting uracil prototrophs. The VMA4 gene on the pRS315 plasmid was propagated in XL 1-Red cells, an Escherichia coli strain which is deficient in three of the primary DNA repair pathways (mutS, mutD, mutT) (Stratagene). The mutagenized plasmids were transformed to the vma4Δ yeast strain by an overnight lithium acetate procedure (33Elble R. Biotechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on supplemented minimal medium lacking leucine. Vma− cells were screened by checking the growth on YEPD, pH 7.5, 60 mmCaCl2 and YEPD, pH 5.0, plates at 25, 30, and 37 °C. Transformants that grew on pH 5.0 but failed to grow on pH 7.5 Ca2+ plates were selected for further characterization as described (34Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To study the assembly of vacuolar ATPase, immunoprecipitations were carried out under nondenaturing conditions in the presence of 0.6 mmdithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) added at the time of solubilization as described (35Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that cells were converted to spheroplasts at room temperature and shaken in supplemented minimal medium lacking methionine containing 1.2 m sorbitol for 20 min at 25 or 37 °C before labeling. ATPase complexes were immunoprecipitated with the 8B1 monoclonal antibody (36Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the turnover of Vma4 protein, cells were converted to spheroplasts and labeled as for the nondenaturing immunoprecipitations and the chase was initiated by addition of unlabeled methionine and cysteine to 0.33 mg/ml each. At each time point, spheroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in 100 μl of pre-warmed immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA) by incubation at 75 °C for 20 min, the lysis mixture was diluted to 0.5 ml with water, then the mixture was placed on ice and pretreated with Protein A-Sepharose Cl-4B. After centrifugation to pellet the Protein A-Sepharose, the supernatant was incubated overnight with 3 μl of rabbit anti-27-kDa polyclonal antiserum (a generous gift from Tom Stevens and Margaret Ho). Protein A-Sepharose was then added to precipitate the immune complexes, and immunoprecipitated proteins were washed, solubilized, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described (35Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Duplicate samples for each time point were quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Model 425E). Vacuolar vesicles were prepared as described (37Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), except that the temperature-sensitive mutant cells were grown overnight at 25 °C and all of samples were converted to spheroplasts at room temperature. JWY1/2μ-vma4-1ts cells and SF838–5Aα cells transformed with YEp24 were grown in supplemented minimal medium lacking uracil to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.8–1.0 before harvesting. The measurement of vacuolar ATPase activity was performed on a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer using a coupled enzyme assay at 25 °C (38Lotscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To examine the thermal stability of the V-ATPase, both types of vesicles were incubated at 25 and 37 °C for 30 and 60 min, then the activity was assayed at 25 °C and samples were taken for Western blotting. In addition, the stability of the activity in the mutant vesicles was monitored by performing the coupled enzyme assay at 37 °C. No decrease in activity was observed over 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry assay (39Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concanamycin A-sensitive ATPase activity was determined by comparing the ATPase activity with and without a 20-min preincubation with 100 nm concanamycin A (40Drose S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). To determine the levels of the 69-, 60-, 42- and 27-kDa subunits in whole cells, the cells were grown overnight at 25 °C, then diluted to equivalent density in YEPD, pH 5.0, medium and grown at both 25 and 37 °C. Equal numbers of cells (∼107) were removed at various times, and whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (41Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuolar proteins were also detected as described previously (41Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 10D7, 7D5, 13D11, and 7A2 monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the 100-, 69-, 60-, and 42-kDa subunits (41Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and polyclonal antisera raised against the 27-kDa subunit were used to detect Vma4p (15Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For staining with quinacrine, cells were grown under various conditions at 25 or 37 °C to logarithmic phase, then 0.5 × 107 cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 2% glucose, incubated with 200 μm quinacrine, pH 7.5, for 5 min, and visualized immediately as described (37Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To visualize actin in whole cells (42Pringle J.R. Preston R.A. Adams A.E.M. Stearns T. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Jones E.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 357-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h after a defined period of growth at 25 or 37 °C. Cells were sonicated, pelleted, washed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Then fixed cells were incubated with 0.6 μmrhodamine-phalloidin for 2 h in the dark. Finally, cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in mounting medium (90% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml ρ-phenylenediamine). Immunofluorescence micrographs were obtained by using an Axioskop (Zeiss) microscope under fluorescein isothiocyanate optics for observation of quinacrine staining and rhodamine optics for observation of actin with a × 100 objective. To detect chitin localization, cells were grown overnight at 25 °C to the mid-logarithmic phase, then diluted to the same density in YEPD, pH 5.0, or YEPD, pH 7.3, medium and grown at 25 or 37 °C. Constant numbers of cells (0.3 × 107) were taken at various times and briefly sonicated in microcentrifuge tubes to disperse clumps, then pelleted and washed with water. Chitin labeling of bud scars was observed after incubation of cells in a 300 μg/ml solution of calcofluor for 5 min in the dark (42Pringle J.R. Preston R.A. Adams A.E.M. Stearns T. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Jones E.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 357-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). For visualization of nuclei, 1 μg/ml DAPI was included in the mounting medium (42Pringle J.R. Preston R.A. Adams A.E.M. Stearns T. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Jones E.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 357-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Chitin and DAPI staining were observed using a UV filter set. Photographs were taken using Tmax 400 film (Kodak). Images were printed on Rapitone paper and arranged using Adobe Photoshop 3.0. Morphology of the cells was observed under Nomarski optics. In scoring populations of wild-type and mutant cells under various conditions, at least 150 cells for each condition were analyzed and large budded cells were defined as cells where the diameter of the smallest spheroid was greater than half of the diameter of the largest one. In order to better characterize the structural and functional roles of the VMA4 gene product, we randomly mutagenized the gene in vitro and then screened for mutations that affected vacuolar H+-ATPase functionin vivo. Deletion of the VMA4 gene leads to the loss of growth on medium buffered to pH greater than 7 or medium containing high concentrations of CaCl2, with the most severe growth defects occurring in medium that has both elevated calcium concentrations and elevated pH (8Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The Vma−phenotype can be complemented by transforming the vma4Δ strain with the plasmid carrying VMA4 gene, as shown in Fig. 1 A. We randomly mutagenized the VMA4 gene by transforming the mutator E. colistrain XL 1-Red with a plasmid-borne copy of the gene. The random mutation rate in the mutator strain was reported to be about one base change per 2000 nucleotides (43Greener A. Callahan M. Strategies. 1994; 7: 32-34Google Scholar). The mutagenized vma4plasmids were used to transform a vma4Δ yeast strain. Transformants were selected by leucine prototrophy and mutant plasmids failing to complement Vma− phenotypes were identified. About 2,300 transformants were screened and 6 colonies exhibiting a Vma− phenotype were selected. From this collection, only 5 mutants producing stable Vma4 protein based on Western blot analysis were identified. When the mutants were screened further for temperature dependence of the pH-sensitive growth phenotype, one of these mutants (vma4-1ts) proved to be temperature conditional, exhibiting the Vma− phenotype only at elevated temperature (37 °C). As shown in Fig. 1A, vma4-1ts cell"

To increase the potency of human DNase I, we have generated and characterized three classes of mutants: (a) hyperactive variants, which have from one to six additional positively charged residues (+1 to +6) and digest DNA much more efficiently relative to wild type, (b) actin-resistant variants, which are no longer inhibited by G-actin, a potent inhibitor of DNase I, and (c) combination variants that are both hyperactive and actin-resistant. For DNA scission in CF sputum where the DNA concentration and length are large, we measured a ∼20-fold increase in potency relative to wild type for the +3 hyperactive variant Q9R/E13R/N74K or the actin-resistant variant A114F; the hyperactive and actin-resistant combination variant was ∼100-fold more potent than wild type DNase I. For digesting lower concentrations of DNA complexed to anti-DNA antibodies in human serum, we found a maximal enhancement of ∼400-fold over wild type for the +2 variant E13R/N74K. The +3 enzymes have ∼4000-fold enhancement for degrading moderate levels of exogenous DNA spiked into human serum, whereas the +6 enzyme has ∼30,000-fold increased activity for digesting the extremely low levels of endogenous DNA found in serum. The actin resistance property of the combination mutants further enhances the degree of potency in human serum.

The presence of anti-nuclear antibodies and immune complexes containing anti-DNA antigens is the hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that affects many organs such as kidney, skin, joints, and central nervous system, resulting in chronic tissue damage (7Hahn B.H. Wallace D.J. Hahn B.H. Dubois' Lupus Erythematosus. 5th Ed. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1997: 69-75Google Scholar, 8Woods Jr., V.L. Kelley W.N. Harris Jr E.D. Ruddy S. Sledge C.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. 4th Ed. 1. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1993: 999-1016Google Scholar). Anti-DNA antibodies, in particular those against double-stranded DNA, have been implicated in inducing some of the disease manifestations of SLE, especially nephritis, and are generally present at elevated serum levels in clinically active disease (9Hahn B.H. Tsao B.P. Wallace D.J. Hahn B.H. Dubois' Lupus Erythematosus. 5th Ed. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1997: 407-422Google Scholar). In SLE patients, anti-DNA antibodies are associated with glomeruli in stained kidney sections and are lower than expected in the urine, suggesting retention in the kidneys. DNase I may potentially block the progression of SLE by hydrolysis of the DNA component of membrane-deposited DNA·anti-DNA immune complexes, facilitating clearance of the anti-DNA antibodies and reducing glomerular nephritis. Alternatively, DNase I could hydrolyze circulating and/or antibody-complexed DNA, reducing the antigen load and subsequent deposition of immune complexes. In a recent study in NZB/W mice, systemic administration of recombinant murine DNase I was found to delay the progression of SLE and demonstrated beneficial effects on renal function and histopathology (10Macanovic M. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Baughman S. Thiru S. Lachmann P.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 106: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). DNase I is an endonuclease that catalyzes the hydrolysis of double-stranded DNA predominantly by a single-stranded nicking mechanism under physiological conditions (11Campbell V.W. Jackson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3726-3735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To improve the biochemical activity and potentially the efficacy of DNase I, we have recently assessed the importance of various residues at the DNA-binding interface and engineered hyperactive variants that utilize a more efficient functional mechanism involving processive nicking of double-stranded DNA (12Pan C.Q. Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Lazarus R.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The hyperactive variants were created by introducing basic amino acids into DNase I at the DNA binding interface to generate attractive interactions with the negatively charged phosphates on the DNA backbone. Based on this principle, we constructed and characterized a series of hyperactive variants having from one to six (+1 to +6) basic residue substitutions (14Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11701-11708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We found that the degree of hyperactivity was inversely proportional to both DNA concentration and length as well as salt concentration. Under pseudophysiological metal ion and salt conditions, these variants displayed maximal activities ranging from several- to thousands-fold greater than wild type depending on the concentration and length of DNA. In addition to improving the intrinsic DNA-degrading activity of DNase I, we have also recently engineered actin-resistant DNase I variants that no longer bind to G-actin, a potent inhibitor of DNase I having a Ki of ∼1 nm (15Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The actin-resistant variants were 10–50-fold more potent than wild type in reducing viscoelasticity as determined in sputum compaction assays, implicating G-actin as a significant inhibitor of DNase I in CF sputum. Because the DNA and actin binding regions are distinct (Fig. 1), we reasoned that combining these mutations into one enzyme should result in variants that are both hyperactive and actin-resistant and thus even more potent. In the present work, we have characterized hyperactive, actin-resistant, and combination variants of human DNase I in several biologically relevant assays to determine their relative potency and pharmacodynamics in CF sputum and human serum. These results have significant implications for their therapeutic potential for treatment of both CF and SLE. Supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA (New England Biolabs) at 29 μg/ml was treated with diluted culture media from human 293 cells transfected with wild type or variant DNase I (final DNase I concentration of 1 ng/ml as measured by a human DNase I ELISA (13Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

After 18 min of DNA digestion, the reaction mix was quenched with 25 mmEDTA, 6% glycerol, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue and loaded directly on a 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was run overnight at ∼1 V/cm in TBE (90 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA), stained with ethidium bromide, and digitized on a Molecular Dynamics model 575 FluorImager. Mock-transfected media displayed no background activity. DNase I degradation of CF sputum DNA was measured by pulsed-field electrophoresis as described previously (15Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The sputum collected from a single patient contained 2.24 mg/ml DNA as measured by a minor modification of the DABA method (16Kissane J.M. Robins E. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) calibrated to a salmon testes DNA standard. The concentration of total actin in this sputum was ∼375 μg/ml as determined by quantitative Western analysis (data not shown). This sputum was aliquoted, frozen for storage, and thawed immediately prior to treatment with 0.5 volume diluted DNase I culture fluid in isotonic buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 150 mm NaCl at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 30 mm EDTA and 1.2% SDS, followed by treatment with 1 mg/ml proteinase K at 50 °C for 2 h. An equal volume of low melting agarose was added to each sample and maintained at 37 °C until loading onto a 1% agarose gel prior to pulsed-field electrophoresis. After the reaction mix plugs solidified in the wells, the gel was run for a 20-h cycle and stained in 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gels were scanned with a FluorImager, followed by quantitation of the intensities found in the 23,000 bp or greater region. The decrease in intensity in this higher molecular weight region over that of the control (no DNase added) is presented as the percent DNA hydrolyzed. Experiments were performed in duplicate. No detectable activity was found using the mock-transfected media. The [33P]DNA digestion assay follows the extensive degradation of DNA in isotonic buffer or serum (17Prince W.S. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Ahmed A.E. Chestnut R.W. Sinicropi D.V. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar); [33P]DNA is an attractive alternative to [32P]DNA because of its longer half-life and lower energy emission. Double-stranded 33P-labeled M13 DNA was adjusted to a constant specific radioactivity of 0.8 μCi/μg by the addition of salmon testes DNA (Sigma). Five μl of this mixture at 81 μg/ml total DNA concentration was added to 90 μl of buffer or human serum followed by addition of 5 μl of diluted DNase I culture media at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by sequential addition of 100 μl of ice-cold 50 mm EDTA and 100 μl of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid, followed by centrifugation at 1230 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Fifty μl of the supernatant, which contains radiolabeled DNA fragments that are ∼20 bp or less in size, was counted in a scintillation counter. Again, mock-transfected media had no background activity. Preparation of human anti-DNA IgG from SLE patient sera complexed to human chromatin from normal human blood has been described (17Prince W.S. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Ahmed A.E. Chestnut R.W. Sinicropi D.V. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 volume of the immune complex added to 8 volumes of normal human serum was digested by 1 volume of diluted DNase I transfection media at 37 °C for 2 h; the reaction was quenched with 25 mm EDTA. Actin was present in the preparation of chromatin; the final concentration of total actin in this serum was ∼13 μg/ml as determined by quantitative Western analysis (data not shown). For the gel-based assay, the stopped reaction mix was treated with 2% SDS and 1.0 mg/ml proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) overnight at 50 °C, followed by electrophoresis on 2.7% MetaPhor agarose (FMC)/0.2% SDS gels in TBE buffer. The gels were stained with 1.0 μg/ml ethidium bromide and scanned with the FotoAnalyst system (Fotodyne). For the ELISA-based assay, the quenched reaction mix was diluted and added to a plate coated with anti-histone monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim), followed by detection with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, Fc-specific (17Prince W.S. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Ahmed A.E. Chestnut R.W. Sinicropi D.V. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular DNA was extracted from normal human serum pool using the QIAamp 96 spin blood kit (Qiagen) with modifications in a 96-well format. The purified endogenous serum DNA was then characterized by quantitative PCR 2D. L. Baker and D. V. Sinicropi, manuscript in preparation. using primers and a dual-labeled probe specific for the human Alu gene. Briefly, the fluorescence of one label is quenched by the other label (18Livak K.J. Flood S.J. Marmaro J. Giusti W. Deetz K. PCR Methods Appl. 1995; 4: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Degradation of the hybridization probe during PCR amplification produces a decrease in fluorescence quenching that is quantified in an Applied Biosystems model 7700 Sequence Detector. The PCR cycle where a fluorescence increase is detected (threshold cycle) is directly proportional to the concentration of target in the sample (19Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Methods. 1996; 6: 986-994Google Scholar). In this study, using the Alu gene as the target, human DNA concentration was interpolated from a calibration curve generated with a human chromatin standard. Previous protein engineering of human DNase I at the actin-binding interface revealed several key positions involved in actin binding (15Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In particular, single point mutations introducing charged, aliphatic, or aromatic residues at Ala114 of the mature enzyme resulted in actin-resistant variants that had >10,000-fold reduced affinity for G-actin (Fig. 1). In the present work, we chose to characterize the A114F mutant, which might potentially reduce any immunogenicity, because phenylalanine is found at position 114 in several other naturally occurring human DNase I-like enzymes, at least one of which has been shown to be actin-resistant (20Baron W.F. Pan C.Q. Spencer S.A. Ryan A.M. Lazarus R.A. Baker K.P. Gene(Amst.). 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 21Zeng Z. Parmalee D. Hyaw H. Coleman T.A. Su K. Zhang J. Gentz R. Ruben S. Rosen C. Li Y.

Genomics. 1997; 42: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have further combined the A114F mutation with ones that make DNase I hyperactive to generate several combination variants (14Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11701-11708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), including Q9R/E13R/N74K/A114F and Q9R/E13R/H44K/N74K/T205K/A114F, and tested them in an actin-binding ELISA (15Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and a plasmid-based actin inhibition assay (Fig. 2). The DNA hydrolytic activity of wild type DNase I is inhibited by actin at concentrations as low as 3 nm, with complete inhibition observed at ∼3 μm. In contrast, the A114F and combination variants were insensitive to actin at concentrations as high as 3 μm(Fig. 2), consistent with their lack of detectable actin binding in the ELISA (data not shown). In the absence of actin, the A114F variant showed similar activity and plasmid DNA digestion patterns as wild type DNase I; the lack of a linearized band in the A114F lane (Fig. 2) is not significant and only reflects a slightly lower amount of enzyme added relative to wild type. Both enzymes cleave DNA via a nicking mechanism as evidence by their low linear to relaxed product ratio (14Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11701-11708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, the products of DNA scission by the combination variants are almost exclusively linear DNA, suggesting a fundamental shift in the functional mechanism. In the absence of NaCl, the overall nicking activity of the combination variants, as measured by the disappearance of the supercoiled substrate (Fig. 2), are actually lower than wild type presumably because of reduced turnover number as a result of stronger DNA binding. However, in the presence of physiological saline, these variants are indeed more active than wild type, especially at low DNA concentrations and size (14Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11701-11708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistent with the structural model for the additivity of these mutations (Fig. 1), we find that the combination variants are both actin-resistant and hyperactive. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of these three classes of DNase I variants, we first tested them in an ex vivo assay in CF sputum, that contained 2.24 mg/ml DNA and ∼375 μg/ml total actin. The degradation of the endogenous high molecular weight DNA in CF sputum as measured by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that the hyperactive variant Q9R/E13R/N74K and the actin-resistant mutant A114F are each ∼20-fold more potent than wild type, whereas the combination variant Q9R/E13R/N74K/A114F is ∼100-fold more active (Fig. 3). To assess the ability of DNase I variants to degrade DNA in human serum, we characterized them using 4 μg/ml of a mixture of 33P-labeled M13 plasmid (7000 bp) and salmon DNA as substrate. In isotonic buffer, a DNase I variant with a single basic amino acid replacement, N74K, is 16-fold more active than wild type (Fig. 4 A and TableI). The degree of hyperactivity increases progressively with each additional positive charge up to the +3 variant E13R/N74K/T205K, which is ∼1300-fold more potent than the native enzyme. Further basic residue substitutions lead to variants with progressively less activity such that the level of hyperactivity for the +6 variant is actually less than that of the +2 variant, but still ∼100-fold greater than that of the wild type (Fig. 4 A). We attribute this decrease in hyperactivity of the +4, +5, and +6 variants to a less efficient turnover of substrate as a result of binding to the DNA too tightly (14Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11701-11708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Table IDNA digestion activity of human DNase I variantsVariantsaThe number of additional positively charged residues relative to wild type DNase I are indicated in parentheses.

For the endogenous serum DNA assay, we reported the EC80instead of EC50, because we could not accurately determine the activity at low variant concentrations (Fig. 7). Open table in a new tab Although the ranking of hyperactive variants remains the same when the [33P]DNA digestion assay is performed in serum, the differences in activity between wild type DNase I and the +2 to +6 variants are even larger than those found in buffer (Fig. 4 Band Table I). The -fold improvement over wild type for the optimal variant E13R/N74K/T205K is ∼3800, almost three times that observed in buffer. The greater degree of hyperactivity found in serum is because of a greater degree of inhibition of native DNase I relative to the hyperactive variants. For example, the activity of the wild type nuclease in serum is 8.5-fold lower than in buffer, whereas that of the +3 to +6 variants are less than 3-fold lower (Table I). In isotonic buffer, the actin-resistant A114F mutation had no effect on the activity of wild type or the hyperactive variant Q9R/E13R/N74K in the [33P]DNA digestion assay (Fig. 4 C and Table I). Both the +3 hyperactive and the +3 combination mutants were ∼500-fold more potent than either wild type or A114F DNase I. Components in serum inhibited the actin-resistant and the +3 combination variants by only 5.7- and 1.4-fold, respectively, which was 33 and 52% lower than the -fold inhibition observed for the wild type and the +3 hyperactive variant, respectively (Table I). The effect of actin resistance on DNA scission activity in serum is minimal when comparing wild type and A114F DNase I; however, a significant enhancement of 2.4-fold for actin resistance was found in the background of the +3 hyperactive variant. These results suggest the presence of relatively low levels of G-actin in human serum that can inhibit activity effectively only at lower DNase I concentrations (Fig. 4 D). Chromatin DNA prepared from normal white blood cells was incubated with SLE serum-derived IgG in normal human serum to form immune complexes. DNase I degradation of these complexes, which have a final DNA concentration of 120 μg/ml and a total actin concentration of ∼13 μg/ml, was assessed by an agarose gel-based assay and an ELISA. As shown in Fig. 5, most of the immune complex DNA is >1,000 bp in size prior to any DNase I treatment. Pulsed-field electrophoresis with higher molecular weight standards revealed that most of the DNA in the immune complexes was 7000–23,000 bp in length (data not shown). Reaction with either wild type or the +3 hyperactive variant E13R/N74K/T205K converts the high molecular weight substrates to fragments of ∼180 and ∼360 bp in length, consistent with cleavage at the linker region of chromatin, which has a nucleosome repeat length of ∼190 bp and ∼150 bp of core region (23Pruss D. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); intermediate digestion products are also consistent with cleavage between nucleosomes (Fig. 5). DNA scission by the native enzyme is undetectable up to ∼3 ng/ml with total digestion occurring at 1 μg/ml DNase I concentration. The +3 variant E13R/N74K/T205K is ∼100-fold more potent than wild type, completely degrading DNA at ∼10 ng/ml. Degradation of immune complexes in serum was also determined by ELISA, which yields similar results to those of the gel-based assay. For example, the wild type enzyme has no activity at 3 ng/ml and 100% activity at 1 μg/ml (Fig. 6 A); the EC50 for DNA scission determined from the ELISA is 32 ng/ml (Table I). The EC50 of the +1 variant N74K is ∼10-fold lower than wild type, whereas that of +2 variant is 400-fold lower. Further addition of positively charged residues decrease the potency so that the +6 variant is only 35-fold more active than the native DNase I. The actin-resistant variant A114F is 20-fold more active than wild type, consistent with the detection of actin in the immune complex preparation. Furthermore, the actin resistance and the hyperactivity in the combination variant Q9R/E13R/N74K/A114F results in the most active enzyme, having ∼650-fold increased potency relative to wild type (Fig. 6 B; Table I). To directly measure DNase I activities in human serum, we applied a Taqman Alu PCR assay to quantitate DNA concentrations. The use of this ultrasensitive assay is necessitated by the extremely low levels of endogenous serum DNA, which range from 25 to 250 ng/ml2; these values are"

These results suggest that transcription ofgrxA might share common redox regulatory mechanism(s) with that of the fpg gene, involved in the repair of 8-oxoguanine in DNA. Deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis are formedde novo by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RRase) 1The abbreviations used are: RRase, ribonucleotide reductase; NrdAB, RRase coded for by thenrdAB operon; NrdEF, RRase coded for by the nrdEFoperon; Trx, thioredoxin; Grx, glutaredoxin; GSH, reduced glutathione; NrdH, protein coded for by the nrdH gene; RT/MPCR, reverse transcription/multiplex polymerase chain reaction; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DEM, diethylmaleate; GAPDH, d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Fpg, formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase. (2Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). RRases, which catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, are divided into three main classes according to the mechanism employed to generate the free radical required for catalysis (3Reichard P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Class I RRases are aerobic enzymes present in all higher organisms and inEscherichia coli. This bacterium actually contains the genetic information for two different class I RRases. One of them (called NrdAB and coded for by the nrdAB operon) is essential for growth in the presence of oxygen, whereas the other (NrdEF, encoded by the separate nrdEF operon) is normally not fully functional (4Jordan A. Aragall E. Gibert I. Barbé J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). No class II RRase has been found in E. coli, and class III enzymes operate only in anaerobiosis (5Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The electrons for ribonucleotide reduction are supplied by thioredoxin (Trx) or glutaredoxin (Grx) in the case of class I RRase (6Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the reduced form, both Trx and Grx contain two redox-active cysteine thiols, which by dithiol-disulfide interchange reduce an acceptor disulfide in the active center of RRase. Reduced Trx is regenerated by thioredoxin reductase and NADPH, whereas oxidized Grx is reduced by two reduced glutathione (GSH) molecules with the formation of glutathione disulfide. The reduction of glutathione disulfide is catalyzed by glutathione reductase and NADPH. E. coli mutants defective in Trx, Grx, or glutathione reductase and those defective in GSH biosynthesis have been named trxA, grx,gor, and gsh, respectively (8Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14997-15005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Russel M. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Berends W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 141: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Apart from the first isolated glutaredoxin (Grx1 coded for by thegrxA gene), E. coli contains two other glutaredoxins (called Grx2 and Grx3) (12Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Like Grx1, both Grx2 and Grx3 show high activity as general GSH-disulfide oxidoreductases. Nevertheless, Grx3 is an inefficient hydrogen donor for RRase in comparison with Grx1 (about 5% of the catalytic activity of Grx1), whereas Grx2 lacks such activity (12Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recently, a glutaredoxin-like protein (called NrdH) with thioredoxin-like activity profile has been isolated from E. coli (13Jordan A. Åslund F. Pontis E. Reichard P. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NrdH is a functional hydrogen donor for RRase with higher specificity for the NrdEF than for the NrdAB enzyme. The physiological function of NrdH in E. coliis not well understood, since the nrdH gene is part of the poorly transcribed nrdEF operon (4Jordan A. Aragall E. Gibert I. Barbé J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have recently proposed that, apart from an assorted set of hydrogen donors and RRase activities, E. coli maintains a balanced supply of deoxyribonucleotides by a regulatory network that compensates the RRase, Trx, Grx1, and GSH levels (1Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Of particular relevance is the large increase in ribonucleotide reductase activity (from 19- to 23-fold) displayed by E. coli strains defective in both Trx and Grx1 (the two main hydrogen donors) (14Miranda-Vizuete A. Martinez-Galisteo E. Åslund F. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16631-16637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the extremely high Grx1 content (55-fold) of bacteria simultaneously lacking Trx and GSH (the physiological hydrogen donor of all glutaredoxins) (1Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This study investigates whether that proposed balanced network is regulated at the transcriptional level. To this end, we have designed and optimized a semi-quantitative reverse transcription/multiplex polymerase chain reaction procedure (RT/MPCR) to simultaneously detect and quantify the expression level of up to seven different genes. The assay is based on competitive primer extension reactions using specific fluorophor-labeled primers and the subsequent DNA sequencer analysis of PCR products. Phenol-saturated II, acrylamide/bis (19/1 mixture), and Tris-buffered EDTA were from Amresco (Solon, OH). GeneAmp RNA PCR kit, Prism Genescan-350 Tamra ladder, fluorescent-labeled primers, and dNTPs were from Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, CT). DNase I (RNase-free) was from Boehringer Mannheim. TaqPlus-long was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). MPCR buffer 3 was from Maxim Biotech (San Francisco, CA). Diethylmaleate (DEM) and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. DEM was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide from Merck. All bacterial strains wereEscherichia coli K-12 and have been previously described (1Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A.

UC844 (ΔtrxA), UC858 (gshA::Tn10kan), UC827 (ΔtrxA, grxA::kan,zbi::Tn10), and UC859 (ΔtrxA, gshA::Tn10kan) were derivatives defective in Trx, GSH, Trx and Grx1, or Trx and GSH, respectively. The Luria-Bertani (LB) nutrient broth and the M9 minimal medium were prepared as described (15Provence D.L. Curtiss III, R. Gerhardt P. Murray R.G.E. Wood W.A. Krieg N.R. Methods for General and Molecular Bacteriology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C1994: 343-345Google Scholar). The media were supplemented (when necessary) with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) or tetracycline (20 μg/ml). The minimal medium contained arginine (40 μg/ml), d-biotin (5 μg/ml), thiamine (5 μg/ml), glucose (2 g/liter), and casamino acids (2 g/liter). Cells were inoculated into LB broth and incubated overnight at 37 °C with gentle shaking (100 rpm). The saturated cultures were diluted 100-fold into 50 ml of fresh LB broth or M9 minimal medium (100-ml Erlenmeyer flask) and incubated at 37 °C and 170 rpm until the cell density reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.7 (unless otherwise indicated). Total RNA was extracted from the cells obtained from 25 ml of culture according to the hot phenol extraction method of Emory and Belasco (16Emory S.A. Belasco J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4472-4481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were rapidly cooled to 0 °C by the addition to crushed ice. The cells were then pelleted and suspended in 0.125 ml of ice-cold 0.3m sucrose, 0.01 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5). After the addition of 0.125 ml of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate in 0.01m sodium acetate (pH 4.5), the cell suspension was heated for 3 min at 70 °C and extracted for 3 min at 70 °C with 0.25 ml of hot phenol that had been preequilibrated with unbuffered water. The RNA was ethanol-precipitated and treated for 60 min at 37 °C with RNase-free DNase I (5 units/μg of RNA) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. The RNA was phenol-extracted twice, ethanol-precipitated, and quantified spectrophotometrically (A 260/280) (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.6-7.9Google Scholar). The quality of the preparation was checked by electrophoresis of 5 μg of RNA in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel. RNA was stored at −80 °C in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water until used. Synthesis of cDNA was carried out with the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit. In short, RNA (1 μg) was retrotranscribed for 15 min at 42 °C with 2.5 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, using random hexamers. The enzyme was inactivated by heating for 5 min at 99 °C. Each RNA sample was retrotranscribed on an average of three separate occasions. PCR amplification of cDNA was carried out using the primer pair sets listed in Table I. Primers were chosen to have high Tm and optimal ΔG for the 3′ pentamers (18Rychlik W. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, 1993: 31-39Google Scholar) in order to obtain the highest specificity and performance in multiplexed PCR reactions. Primers were designed with the Primer Select 3.03/96 (DNA Star, Madison, WI) and Oligo 5.0/96 (National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN) programs. PCR conditions were optimized so that only the desired products were produced. Twenty-seven cycles of PCR were performed. Each cycle consisted of 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 15 s of annealing at 70 °C, and 30 s for enzymatic primer extension at 72 °C. The multiplex PCR amplification was performed in a mixture containing 1.5 units of TaqPlus-long, 2.5 μl of MPCR buffer 3, 1 mm of each dNTP, and the following amounts of primers: 3 pmol (gor), 1.25 pmol (grxA), 1.25 pmol (trxA), 2.75 pmol (nrdA), 3 pmol (nrdB), 2.5 pmol (fpg), and 2 pmol (gapA) in a final volume of 25 μl. The relationship between the fluorescence signal of PCR products and the input DNA target concentrations was investigated for each individual gene. Serial dilutions of genomic DNA from wild type bacteria were used as a target for the PCR step. Individual PCR amplifications were carried out under the standard conditions fixed for multiplexed PCR reactions. As exemplified in Fig. 1 for thenrdA, grxA, and trxA genes, there was a direct linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the number of target DNA molecules in the range from 102 to 105 molecules (coefficient of correlation r≥ 0.98). Over 105 DNA molecules, the fluorescence signal was less intense than expected from the linear relationship; below 102 molecules, an insufficient signal was obtained with the number of PCR cycles used (27 cycles). Similar profiles were observed with the rest of the genes. Based on these results, the amount of cDNA was adjusted in the multiplexed PCR reactions reported herein to produce a fluorescence intensity in the range of linearity.Table IPCR primer characteristicsPrimerLength (bases)Sequencegor*HEX-labeled (forward)23-mer5′-TGTATACCGCCGTCACCACTCAC-3′gor (reverse)23-mer5′-CCTGCAACATTTCGTCCATACCA-3′grxA*FAM-labeled (forward)22-mer5′-GCGTGCAAAAGATCTGGCTGAG-3′grxA(reverse)22-mer5′-GGCACGGTTTCTACGGGTTTAC-3′trxA*HEX-labeled (forward)20-mer5′-TGCGGTCCGTGCAAAATGAT-3′trxA(reverse)21-mer5′-AGCAGCAGAGTCGGGATACCA-3′nrdA*TET-labeled (forward)24-mer5′-CGTTGACCACTGCATAACCCATAG-3′nrdA (reverse)21-mer5′-GCGTACACAGCGCGATTTCAC-3′nrdB*TET-labeled (forward)21-mer5′-TTCTGGCGTCCGGAAGAAGTT-3′nrdB(reverse)20-mer5′-GGGCTACGACCCTGAATGGA-3′fpg*FAM-labeled (forward)20-mer5′-CGGCTGGCGTCATCACTGTC-3′fpg(reverse)25-mer5′-AAATAGCCCGGTTTACCATCACTTT-3′gapA*HEX-labeled (forward)23-mer5′-GTTGTCGCTGAAGCAACTGGTCT-3′gapA(reverse)24-mer5′-GAAGTTAGCGCCTTTAACGAACAT-3′ Open table in a new tab After amplification, 2 μl of the multiplex PCR product was mixed with 0.5 μl of Prism Genescan-350 Tamra ladder, 2.5 μl of deionized formamide, and 0.5 μl of loading buffer. Samples were denatured at 95 °C for 2 min and run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel at 800 V in an ABI 373A Stretch Sequencer from Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Samples produced bands of correct size for the primers used. Data were collected and analyzed with the ABI Collection 1.1/96 and ABI Analysis 2.1/97 software programs, respectively (Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems). Fig. 2 shows a representative electropherogram pattern of RT/MPCR products from wild type cDNA samples and the corresponding gel image. Differences in amplification efficiencies among samples were normalized by referring the fluorescence intensity of each band to that resulting fromgapA amplification (used as reference gene, unless otherwise indicated). Significant variations in the ratios indicate relative differences in the initial mRNA levels among the bacterial strains or experimental conditions being compared. Samples from different bacterial strains were handled in parallel. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. from n independent multiplexed PCR amplifications. Comparison between groups was done by a student′st test. Significances at the level of p < 0.001 are indicated in the text. To compare the levels of mRNA coding for glutathione reductase (gor), Grx1 (grxA), Trx (trxA), and NrdAB ribonucleotide reductase (nrdAand nrdB) from different E. coli strains, we designed and optimized a RT/MPCR procedure in which fluorescent PCR products were separated on acrylamide gels using an ABI 373A Stretch Sequencer and analyzed with the Genescan software. d-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key enzyme of the glycolytic and gluconeogenesis pathways. In E. coli, GAPDH is encoded by the household gapA gene, which is controlled by a very efficient multiple promoter system to allow the production of large amounts of gapA transcripts in a wide variety of environmental conditions (19Charpentier B. Branlant C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 830-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GAPDH activity was determined according to Della Seta et al. (20Della Seta F. Boschi-Muller S. Vignais M.L. Branlant G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5218-5221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in order to verify that all bacterial strains used in this work displayed similar basal GAPDH activity levels (about 115 milliunits/mg of protein). For purposes of semi-quantitative analysis, the data were expressed as the ratio of the signals obtained for each individual gene divided by the signal obtained from gapA mRNA of the corresponding sample. Gene expression was analyzed in mutant strains defective in both Trx and Grx1 (UC827) or in both Trx and GSH (UC859) and in the corresponding parental wild type (UC5710) (TableII). Bacteria were grown in LB nutrient broth until the cell density reached an OD at 600 nm of 0.7. Under these growth conditions, the levels of both nrdA andnrdB mRNA in UC827 were 5.3- and 3.5-fold higher, respectively, than those from the wild type. Likewise, a 36.2-fold increase in the amount of grxA transcript was observed in the mutant strain UC859. As expected, bacteria carrying the null ΔtrxA and grxA::kanmutations had undetectable levels of the corresponding mRNA. Other increments reported in Table II were not significant at thep < 0.001 level, except the small increase (1.9-fold) in the amount of gor transcript detected in UC827. The enhanced expression of nrdAB operon in UC827 and ofgrxA gene in UC859 agrees with the increments in RRase activity and Grx1 protein level previously reported for these mutant strains under identical growth conditions (1Miranda-Vizuete A.

To test whether the differences in gene expression between the mutant strains UC827 and UC859 and the wild type UC5710 showed variations along the exponential phase or with the growth medium, bacteria at late-exponential phase (A 600 = 0.7) in LB nutrient broth were compared with those at mid-exponential phase (A 600 = 0.4) and to those grown in M9 minimal medium (Fig. 3). The M9 medium was supplemented with casamino acids (2 g/liter), which are required for the trxA grxA double mutant strain (UC827) to grow in minimal liquid cultures (14Miranda-Vizuete A. Martinez-Galisteo E. Åslund F. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16631-16637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of nrdAB in UC827 and of grxA in UC859 was enhanced in all conditions. However, the increments of nrdAB transcripts relative to wild type were higher in M9 minimal medium than in LB nutrient broth, thus making significant the differences observed with both mutant strains (UC827 and UC859). The expression levels at mid-exponential phase paralleled those observed in M9 medium. It must be noticed that in both conditions the higher increments in nrdABtranscripts were compensated in UC859 with lower increments ingrxA expression. DEM is an electrophilic compound that conjugates with GSH in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase (22Meister A. Meister A. Methods in Enzymology. 113. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, Florida1985: 571-585Google Scholar), an activity that is found in E. coli although at 2 orders of magnitude lower than in cytosolic fractions of rat liver (23Kranendonk M. Commandeur J.N.M. Laires A. Rueff J. Vermeulen N.P.E. Mutagenesis. 1997; 12: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). DEM is considered a very effective agent for in vivo glutathione depletion in eukaryotic cells (24Mulder G.J. Koppele J.M. Sies H. Ketterer B. Glutathione Conjugation. Mechanisms and Biological Significance. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, California1988: 357-389Google Scholar). The effects of GSH depletion by DEM on gene expression are summarized in Fig. 4. Bacteria defective in both Trx and GSH (UC859) and the corresponding single defective strains (UC858 and UC844) were used in comparison with the parental wild type (UC5710). Treatments with 30 mm DEM were for 10, 30, or 60 min. GSH depletion efficiency was tested by measuring the intracellular GSH contents, as previously reported (1Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). DEM decreased the bacterial GSH content to about 13% after a 10-min treatment and to 3% after a 60-min exposure. No differences in GSH contents with or without DEM treatments were observed between the two GSH-proficient bacterial strains (UC844 and UC5710). Bacteria (UC858 and UC859) carrying the null gshA::Tn10kan allele that blocks the first step in the GSH biosynthetic pathway showed undetectable GSH levels as expected (1Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). DEM treatments decreased dramatically the amounts of gapA transcripts in all bacterial strains, making it difficult to use this as a reference mRNA. Therefore, variations in amplification efficiencies among samples were normalized in these experiments by referring the signals of each individual gene to that ofgor. Fig. 4 shows the ratios of the values from DEM-treated cultures divided by those from the corresponding untreated controls. In wild type cells (UC5710), DEM had no effect on gene expression after 10 min of treatment, but a moderate increase of approximately 4-fold and a large increment of 30-fold was observed in grxAexpression after 30 and 60 min of treatment, respectively. Similar increases in grxA expression were observed in the GSH-defective bacterial strain (UC858). On the other hand, DEM rapidly triggered the grxA expression in bacteria lacking Trx (UC844); induction ratios from 11- to 15-fold were observed from the first 10 min of treatment. However, no significant increments were observed in bacteria lacking both Trx and GSH (UC859), probably due to the high steady-state level of grxA expression (16-fold increase as compared with wild type) in UC859 (Fig. 5). The impairment of genetic integrity induced by 8-oxoguanine, the major oxidative product of DNA guanine, is prevented by the formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), coded for the E. coli fpg gene (25Wallace S.S. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 49-90Google Scholar). In close parallelism with grxAexpression, transcription of the fpg gene was decreased in the presence of Trx or GSH (Fig. 5) and was oppositely increased upon DEM exposure (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, in all cases, the increase in the amounts of grxA transcripts was higher than that offpg transcripts (e.g. 37- versus11-fold for maximal DEM induction levels). In contrast togrxA and fpg, the amounts of the trxA,nrdA, and nrdB transcripts remained basically unchanged with or without DEM treatment. In this paper we demonstrate that the previously proposed regulatory network, in which the ribonucleotide reductase activity is balanced with the levels of its hydrogen donor systems (1Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), operates at the transcriptional level. Regulation of the E. coli NrdAB ribonucleotide reductase transcription is highly complex and not well understood. The expression of nrdAB genes increases when DNA synthesis is inhibited (26Hanke P.D. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is cell cycle-regulated (27Sun L. Fuchs J.A. Mol. Biol.

The nrdAB operon has a complicated regulatory sequence that includes Fis (factor for inversion stimulation) and DnaA (DNA replication initiation protein) binding sites (29Augustin L.B. Jacobson B.A. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 378-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an AT-rich sequence (30Sun L. Jacobson B.A. Dien B.S. Srienc F. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2415-2426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fis and DnaA increase the expression of an nrd-lacZ fusion construct 2- to 3-fold (29Augustin L.B. Jacobson B.A. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 378-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cis-acting upstream AT-rich sequence is the essential element for the cell cycle regulation of nrdAB expression (30Sun L. Jacobson B.A. Dien B.S. Srienc F. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2415-2426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA supercoiling is required for the positive regulation by Fis protein (28Sun L. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4617-4626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here add further complexity to the regulation ofnrdAB operon, demonstrating for the first time that the lack of both Trx and Grx1 increases the transcription of nrdABgenes (maximal induction levels of 10- and 9-fold for nrdAand nrdB transcripts, respectively). Trx and Grx1 could affect nrdAB expression as redox-active proteins. Alternatively, the operation of ribonucleotide reductase in the absence of Trx and Grx1 could lead to an unbalanced deoxyribonucleotide production and disturbances similar to treatments that block DNA synthesis. Increments in nrdAB expression were higher in bacteria at mid-exponential phase in LB broth or at late-exponential in M9 medium than at late-exponential in LB, a result that might be related with increased Fis level under those growth conditions (31Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all circumstances, the increments in nrdA expression were somewhat higher than in nrdB expression, in contrast to what might be expected from the existence of an extra promoter fornrdB gene (32Gibert I. Calero S. Barbé J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it must be noticed that expression of nrdB gene is about 14-fold lower from its own promoter than from the nrdA promoter and, even more important, nrdB expression is stimulated by DNA damage only when it is transcribed from the nrdA promoter (32Gibert I. Calero S. Barbé J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Lower amounts of nrdB transcripts might be due to transcription termination after the nrdA gene, as previously indicated (33Hanke P.D. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This work also demonstrates that the simultaneous deficiency in Trx and GSH (the physiological hydrogen donor of all glutaredoxins) results in a dramatic increase of 36-fold in grxA transcription (as compared with wild type bacteria). This up-regulation was not accompanied by a significant increase in nrdAB expression, in agreement with the inverse relation observed between RRase activity and the levels of its hydrogen donors (1Miranda-Vizuete A. Rodriguez-Ariza A. Toribio F. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19099-19103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Actually, transcription ofnrdAB genes was increased significantly in Trx- and GSH-defective bacteria only under growth conditions yielding increments in grxA expression lower than 30-fold. The increased expression of grxA gene in trxA gshA double mutant bacteria could be easily mimicked in trxA single mutant cells by depletion of GSH with diethylmaleate. This induction ofgrxA transcription was found to be rapid, since maximal increase could be detected after only 10 min of DEM exposure. With treatment over 60 min, DEM induced grxA gene expression also in a wild type genetic background. In this case, the inductive effect of DEM was not simply due to a transient depletion of GSH, since the GSH-negative strain was also responsive to the reagent. These results could be explained if Trx is inactivated, directly or indirectly, upon longer DEM exposure. In agreement with this, DEM treatment did not further enhance the high steady-state level of grxA mRNA in trxA gshA bacteria. Provocative enough was the finding that the basal level of fpg expression (like that ofgrxA gene) is substantially higher (about 4-fold) in thetrxA gshA double mutant strain than in the wild type, this expression also being induced upon exposure to DEM (maximal induction level of 11-fold). Little is known about the control of grxA transcription, except for a recent report indicating a mild 2-fold induction in the amount of grxA transcript by 100 μm hydrogen peroxide in an oxyR-dependent fashion (34Tao K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5967-5970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been recently demonstrated that GSH and Grx1 inactivate OxyR after oxidative stress (35Zheng M. Åslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The large (36-fold) increased expression of grxA gene in trxA gshAdouble mutant bacteria grown under standard conditions might be explained by assuming that OxyR is fully oxidized in the absence of both Trx and GSH, hence triggering grxA expression. Nevertheless, an oxyR-independent mechanism can not be excluded, since, in contrast to grxA expression, the transcription of gor, one of the genes whose expression is activated by OxyR (36Jamieson D.J. Storz G. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 91-115Google Scholar), was unaffected in Trx- and GSH-defective bacteria. With regard to the E. coli fpg gene, our work represents a first example of variations in its expression and the first indication of a Trx- and GSH-mediated transcriptional regulation mechanism. However, it must be acknowledged that the activity of Fpg seems rapidly induced in E. coli by dioxygen and superoxide-producing agents and in parallel to the activity of superoxide dismutase, thus suggesting the possibility that both enzymes share common redox regulatory mechanism(s) (37Kim H.S. Park Y.W. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Park C.W. Choi K.H. Chung M.H. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Glutathione has long been implicated in the regulation of gene expression in E. coli. Hence, Gardner and Fridovich (38Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17591-17595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that GSH suppresses the in vitro transcription of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase gene (denotedsodA), which is a member of the soxRS regulon (36Jamieson D.J. Storz G. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 91-115Google Scholar). Interesting enough is the recent finding that GSH in aerobic solution disrupts the SoxR (2Fe-2S) clusters, releasing Fe2+from the regulatory protein and eliminating the SoxR transcriptional activity (39Ding H. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9449-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Such a reaction might occur in vivo, since induction of SoxR-dependent soxS transcription was found to be higher in a GSH-deficient E. coli strain than in its GSH-containing parent (39Ding H. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9449-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One might speculate that a GSH-mediated disassembly of iron-sulfur centers of SoxR or other key regulatory proteins governs the transcriptional regulation of bothgrxA and fpg genes. In such a case, our data suggest that Trx might cause a similar disassembly of iron-sulfur clusters. More experiments will be required to unravel the detailed mechanisms by which the in vivo transcription of nrdAB operon is controlled by Trx and Grx1 levels and by which those ofgrxA and fpg genes are suppressed by Trx and GSH. To this end, the multiplex fluorescence-based primer extension analysis described in this work will be of relevance. Key advantages of this procedure are its ease of design, potential for multiplexing and automation, and wide applicability and avoidance of radioisotopic labels. Its utility, sensitivity and reproducibility has been shown by comparing the expression of genes coding for glutathione reductase (gor), Trx (trxA), Grx1 (grxA), NrdAB ribonucleotide reductase (nrdA nrdB), and Fpg glycosylase (fpg) in a set of E. coli strains.

https://openalex.org/W2096048303,"Abstract Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I signaling through the IGF-I receptor modulates cellular adhesion and proliferation and the transforming ability of cells overexpressing the IGF-I receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins is essential for this transduction of the IGF-I-induced mitogenic and tumorigenic signals. IGF-I induces specific cytoskeletal structure and the phosphorylation of proteins in the associated focal adhesion complexes. The determination of the exact pathways emanating from the IGF-I receptor that are involved in mediating these signals will contribute greatly to the understanding of IGF-I action. We have previously shown that replacement of tyrosine residues 1250 and 1251 in the carboxyl terminus of the IGF-I receptor abrogates IGF-I-induced cellular proliferation and tumor formation in nude mice. In this study, replacement of either tyrosine 1250 or 1251 similarly reduces the cells ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. The actin cytoskeleton and cellular localization of vinculin are disrupted by replacement of tyrosine 1251. Tyrosine residues 1250 and 1251 are not essential for tyrosine phosphorylation of two known substrates; insulin receptor substrate-1 and SHC, nor association of known downstream adaptor proteins to these substrates. In addition, these mutant IGF-I receptors do not affect IGF-I-stimulated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation or phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′-kinase activity. Thus, it appears that in fibroblasts expressing tyrosine 1250 and 1251 mutant IGF-I receptors, the signal transduction pathways impacting on mitogenesis and tumorigenesis do not occur exclusively through the PI 3′-kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways."

Rev. 1997; 18: 739-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). These highly homologous proteins are unusual among G protein-coupled receptors in that they contain a very large extracellular hormone binding domain. FSH transduction pathways involve mainly Gs proteins coupling and the ensuing activation of adenylate cyclase (5Simoni M. Gromoll J. Nieschlag E. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 739-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The FSH receptor has a central role in reproduction through the control of gonadal development and gamete production (5Simoni M. Gromoll J. Nieschlag E. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 739-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). In males it is expressed in testicular Sertoli cells. These cells form an epithelial blood barrier and control the development of spermatogenesis (6Dym M. Fawcett B.W. Biol. Reprod. 1970; 3: 308-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In females, the FSHR is expressed in the granulosa cells of the ovaries. It controls follicular growth and, in cooperation with the LH receptor, ovarian steroidogenesis (2Misrahi M. Beau I. Meduri G. Bouvattier C. Atger M. Loosfelt H. Ghinea N. Vu Hai M.T. Bougneres P. Milgrom E. Baillieres Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known of the intracellular trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors and, more specifically, of this subgroup of receptors. The pathways of internalization of the LH and TSH receptors have been studied at the ultrastructural level (7Ghinea N. Vu Hai M.T. Groyer-Picard M.T. Houllier A. Schoëvaërt D. Milgrom E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), 2C. Baratti-Elbaz, N. Ghinea, H. Loosfelt, C. Pichon, and E. Milgrom, unpublished results. but the molecular signals involved are still unknown. The LH receptor is also present in the vascular endothelium of the testes (8Ghinea N. Vu Hai M.T. Groyer-Picard M.T. Milgrom E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This endothelial LH receptor is involved in receptor-mediated hormone transcytosis, leading to the accumulation of the hormone in close proximity to the target cells. FSHR has been detected in the vascular endothelial cells of the testes (9Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Meduri G. Pichon C. Milgrom E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1358-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but its role in hormone transcytosis has not been studied to date. Another particularity of gonadotrophin and thyrostimulin receptors is their polarized cellular expression in several target tissues. Immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal antibodies have shown that the FSH receptor in Sertoli cells and the TSH receptor in thyroid follicular cells have a polarized basolateral expression (9Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Meduri G. Pichon C. Milgrom E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1358-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). By contrast, the LH receptor is expressed circumferentially in the ovarian granulosa and theca cells and in the testicular Leydig cells (11Meduri G. Vu Hai M.T. Jolivet A. Milgrom E. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Meduri G. Vu Hai M.T. Jolivet A. Takemori S. Kominami S. Driancourt M.A. Milgrom E. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 148: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This difference in receptor distribution could result from either a difference in the structure of the receptors or from differential expression in polarized or nonpolarized cells. To distinguish between these possibilities, we have transfected the three receptors into polarized MDCK cells (13Beau I. Misrahi M. Gross B. Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Vu Hai M.T. Pichon C. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We observed that all three receptors were directly delivered to the basolateral membrane of these cells, suggesting that they all contain a basolateral targeting signal. The molecular signals involved in the polarized targeting of G protein-coupled receptors and more generally of hormone receptors in epithelial cells have still not been identified. We have thus undertaken to delineate this signal in the FSH receptor. In vitro mutagenesis was followed by establishment of permanent MDCK cell lines expressing mutated receptors. We report here the localization of the basolateral targeting signal, its structure, the functional importance of the individual amino acids, and the noncolinearity of this signal with the signal for receptor endocytosis. The vector encoding the wild-type FSH receptor cDNA (pSG5-FSHR) has previously been described (9Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Meduri G. Pichon C. Milgrom E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1358-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction-mediated oligonucleotide mutagnesis was used to introduce stop codons into the pSG5-FSHR vector to produce vectors encoding FSHRΔ657–695 and FSHRΔ677–695. In the case of the FSHRΔ657–695, a 821-base pair fragment (positions 1244–2065 of the cDNA sequence, +1 being the first base of the initiation codon) containing a stop codon at residue 657 was constructed. After digestion with PflMI, the purified fragment was subcloned into the pSG5-FSHR vector previously digested with the same enzyme. In the case of the FSHRΔ677–695, the same strategy was used. A 486-base pair fragment (positions 1793–2279 of the cDNA sequence) containing a stop codon at residue 677 was digested withSapI and EcoRI. It was cloned into the pSG5-FSHR vector previously digested with SapI andEcoRI. The FSHRΔ692–695 mutant was prepared by generating a KpnI site at position 3098 of pSG5-FSHR using the same strategy as described above for the FSHRΔ677–695 mutant. This mutation yields a conservative substitution of threonine 682 for a serine. This substitution does not alter the polarity or the functional properties of the receptor. A synthetic double strand mutated oligonucleotide was then inserted between the KpnI and the EcoRI sites. All of the constructs were verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the FSH receptor basolateral signal was performed using a series of synthetic oligonucleotides inserted between two restriction sites flanking the signal. The oligonucleotides were introduced either between theSapI (position 3075 of the pSG5 FSHR vector) and theKpnI sites or between the KpnI and theEcoRI (position 3145) sites. The mutants Gly681 → Ala and Ser682 → Ala were constructed using polymerase chain reaction-mediated oligonucleotide mutagenesis. A 486-base pair fragment (positions 1793–2279 of the cDNA sequence) containing the Gly681→ Ala or the Ser682 → Ala substitution was digested with SapI and EcoRI, purified, and cloned into the SapI–EcoRI-digested pSG5-FSHR. The neurotrophin receptor (NTR) cDNA, cloned in the pCB6 vector, which lacks its intracellular domain (six residues downstream the transmembrane domain), has previously been described (14Hempstead B.L. Patil N. Thiel B. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9595-9598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basolateral localization signal of the FSHR was introduced into the XbaI site. The stop codon TAG, located just before the basolateral signal, was then mutated to a GAG codon encoding a glutamine using the same strategy as described above, yielding the NTRt/FSHR-(678–691) hybrid receptor. The control vector (NTRt) that was used contained a stop codon just before the first residue of the signal. MDCK cells (type II) were seeded and grown on coverslips (Nunc) or filters (0.4-μm polycarbonate Transwell Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) as described previously (13Beau I. Misrahi M. Gross B.

The cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding either the wild-type or the mutated FSHR and with the plasmid pSV-neo, which confers resistance to the antibiotic G418.

The cells were washed, and the aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS+ for 30 min. After 1 h of saturation with PBS+, 1% BSA (albumin, fraction V, Boehringer Mannheim), the cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a humid chamber with the monoclonal anti-FSHR antibody FSHR323, (5 μg/ml in PBS+, 1% BSA). The cells where then washed with PBS+, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and incubated for 1 h with a Cy3-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma).

The gels were fixed and processed for fluorography. Densitometric scanning was used for quantification. COS-7 cells were transfected with wild-type FSHR or the truncated FSHRΔ677–695 using Superfect (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Internalization from the cell surface of wild-type FSHR or of the truncated FSHRΔ677–695 was determined by using 125I-labeled FSH (NEN Life Science Products, 130 μCi/μg, 26 μCi/ml). COS-7 cells plated on six-well plates were quickly cooled to 4 °C using two washes with ice-cold PBS, 1% BSA. The cells were incubated with 125I-FSH (7000 cpm/μl in PBS, 1% BSA) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then extensively washed at 4 °C to remove unbound ligand and were allowed to internalize the ligand for various time periods at 37 °C. One set of plates that were kept at 4 °C was used to measure the initial FSH binding. The internalization was stopped by rapid cooling to 4 °C. The ligand remaining on the cell surface was stripped with 50 mm glycine in PBS containing 1% BSA, pH 2, for 10 min at 4 °C. Finally, the cells were treated with 0.2 m NaCl, and the total radioactivity was counted. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of an excess of unlabeled FSH (Serono) and with nontransfected COS-7 cells. Internalized ligand was expressed as the percentage of the total radioactivity (corrected for nonspecific binding) initially bound to the cells. Internalization was also studied in MDCK cells permanently expressing the wild-type FSHR or the truncated FSHRΔ677–695. The cells were seeded on filters and incubated 48 h later with125I-FSH added to the basolateral compartment (10 min at 37 °C). The MDCK cells were then processed as described above for the COS-7 cells. Secondary structure predictions were performed using computer modeling. Two methods were used: the protein sequence analysis method (20Stultz C.M. White J.V. Smith T.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and neural network prediction (21McGregor M.J. Flores T.P. Sternberg M.J.E. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To establish whether the intracellular domain of the FSH receptor contains basolateral sorting information, we constructed three mutants deleted for various parts of the C-terminal tail of the receptor (Fig. 2 A). The truncated receptors were stably expressed in MDCK cell lines. For each mutant, several (at least five) independent clones exhibiting different levels of expression were analyzed with the anti-FSH receptor monoclonal antibodies by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1). Monoclonal antibodies BC11 (Fig. 1 a) and BB28 (Fig. 1 b) that recognize the ectodomain of endogenous antigens restricted to the basolateral and the apical compartments of MDCK cell membrane, respectively (13Beau I.

Confocal microscopic examination of the distribution of FSHR deletion mutants in polarized MDCK cells is shown. Polarized monolayers of cells were grown to confluence on coverslips. They were treated with EGTA. The cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described under “Materials and Methods.” Primary antibodies corresponded to monoclonal antibodies BC11 (a) and BB18 (b) recognizing, respectively, a basolateral and an apical endogenous antigen of MDCK cells. Monoclonal antibody FSHR 323 was also used to analyze the wild type (c) and the Δ657–695 (d), Δ677–695 (e), and Δ692–695 (f) receptor mutants. In each case, the upper panel shows xyhorizontal focal sections (parallel through MDCK cells) taken in the plane of the apical (a, c, and f) or lateral (b, d, and e) membrane. In each panel the lower part represents the corresponding xz section taken in 0.1-μm steps through the en face view represented above (at 90° to the xy sections). When the immunolabeling was detected in one compartment, no labeling or very faint labeling was observed in the opposite compartment of the cell membrane (not shown). Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the first mutant (FSHRΔ657–695), the major part of the intracellular domain of the receptor was deleted. The cell lines expressing mutant or wild-type receptors were incubated with the anti-FSHR ectodomain antibody in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 1). This compound opens the tight junctions (13Beau I. Misrahi M. Gross B. Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Vu Hai M.T. Pichon C. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and thus allows antibodies to reach the totality of the cell surface. In cells expressing the wild-type receptor, a strong labeling of the basolateral membrane was observed with a reticular pattern characteristic of basolateral antigens (see in Fig. 1 c a confocal horizontal section close to the basal pole of the cell). In cells expressing the truncated FSHRΔ657–695 receptor, there was a strong apical labeling (see in Fig. 1 d a confocal horizontal section close to the apical pole of the cell). Confocal vertical sections confirmed that the wild-type FSHR was predominantly expressed in the basolateral domain (Fig. 1 c) and the FSHRΔ657–695 in the apical domain of cell membranes (Fig. 1 d). To narrow down the sequences of the cytoplasmic tail of the FSHR necessary for basolateral targeting, we next analyzed by confocal microscopy two additional deletion mutants: FSHRΔ677–695 and FSHRΔ692–695. While the first mutant exhibited mainly an apical localization very similar to that of the FSHRΔ657–695 mutant (Fig. 1 e), the second mutant, FSHRΔ692–695, had a predominant basolateral polarized expression indistinguishable from the wild-type receptor (Fig. 1 f). Thus, the sequence located between residues 678 and 691 is very likely to contain basolateral sorting information. To quantify the relative proportion of receptor targeted to each membrane domain at steady state, we performed surface immunoprecipitation experiments. MDCK cells expressing wild-type or mutated receptors were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine for 1 h and chased for 3 h with a medium containing unlabeled amino acids (see “Materials and Methods”). Antireceptor antibodies were added either to the basal or to the apical compartment of MDCK cells during the last hour of the chase period. The receptor-antibody complexes were purified and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. For the wild-type FSHR, ∼85% of the receptor molecules were immunoprecipitated from the basolateral surface (Fig. 2 B). The same result was obtained for the FSHRΔ692–695 truncated mutant, while for clones expressing the Δ677–695 or Δ657–695 truncated mutants only ∼30% of the receptor molecules were found on the basolateral surface of MDCK cells, the majority of receptors being detected on the apical domain. These results thus confirm the immunocytochemical studies localizing the signal between residues 678 and 691 of the FSHR. The truncation of FSH receptor at amino acid 677 might have provoked a change in receptor polarization by several mechanisms: loss of a basolateral sorting signal, increased transcytosis, or deletion of a basolateral anchoring sequence (reviewed in Refs. 22Mostov K.E. Apodaca G. Aroeti B. Okamoto C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar and 23Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Analysis of the kinetics of appearance of the newly synthesized protein on the basolateral and apical cell surfaces allows us to distinguish between these mechanisms (15Casanova J.E. Apodaca G.

Such an analysis was performed by metabolic labeling of the cells followed by selective surface immunoprecipitation at various time intervals. As shown in Fig. 3, after 30 min of chase, the newly synthesized FSH receptor Δ677–695 was already detected on the apical surface of MDCK cells. A minority of receptor molecules (∼25%) were also delivered to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells at this time. This was in marked contrast to what has been previously observed for the wild-type receptor, which was mainly detected on the basolateral membrane of MDCK cells in the same conditions (13Beau I. Misrahi M. Gross B. Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Vu Hai M.T. Pichon C. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Throughout the chase period, delivery of the mutant receptor to each surface remained constant at each time period. Approximately 60–70% of the labeled receptor molecules were found on the apical surface. There was no indication that the truncated receptor presented an increased transcytosis or decreased anchorage at the basolateral surface of the cells. This experiment thus suggested that a basolateral localization signal has been inactivated in the truncated receptor. Furthermore, the fact that the majority of receptor molecules were delivered to the apical cell surface indicates that apical sorting signal(s) may be present elsewhere in the FSHR protein and be revealed by the deletion of basolateral targeting sequences. To define precisely the amino acids involved in receptor basolateral targeting, we mutated each one of the 14 residues of the 678–691 sequence into an alanine (TableI). The polarized expression of the receptor mutants was analyzed by confocal microscopy and quantified by cell surface immunoprecipitation. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the main effects were observed with mutations of Tyr684 or Leu689. The corresponding receptor mutants exhibited a 55 and 45% delivery to the apical surface of MDCK cells, respectively (Fig. 5). More limited effects were observed when residues in the vicinity of Tyr684 and Leu689 were mutated; about 35% of Gly681, Ile685, and His691 mutant receptors were detected at the apical surface of MDCK cells (Fig. 5 and Table I). Basolateral localization was not altered by point mutations of serine and threonine into alanine, indicating that phosphorylation of these amino acids is not involved in the vectorial sorting of the FSHR.Table IPoint mutations in the basolateral targeting signal of the FSH receptorReceptorSequenceApical receptor%FSHR wild typeVTSGS¯TYILVPLSH20FSHR V678AA————-20FSHR T679A-A————20FSHR S680A–A———–20FSHR G681A—A———-35FSHR S682A—-A———25FSHR T683A—–A——–20FSHR Y684A——A——-55FSHR I685A——-A——35FSHR L686A——–A—–20FSHR V687A———A—-20FSHR P688A———-A—25FSHR L689A———–A–45FSHR S690A————A-20FSHR H691A————-A35A series of point alanine substitutions were generated in the 678–691 sequence of the FSHR as described under “Materials and Methods.” The substitutions performed are indicated on the left.

In an attempt to dissect the molecular mechanism of the Zucker fatty rat leptin receptor mutation (Gln269 → Pro) we analyzed the effects of this mutation on leptin receptor signaling and expression in three different expression systems: 1) 32D cells expressing leptin/erythropoietin receptor chimeras, 2) COS-7 cells expressing a leptin receptor short form, and 3) 293 cells expressing soluble receptor forms. To determine if the Gln269 → Pro mutation is critical for the observed phenotype, we made a similar Gln → Pro mutation at a vicinal residue two amino acids upstream of the fatty mutation to see if it would have similar effects. Incorporation of either of the Gln → Pro mutations into wild type receptor forms did not interfere with leptin binding, but it resulted in a signaling-incompetent receptor. In addition, the majority of the mutant receptor protein was localized intracellularly. Our results suggest that the obese phenotype resulting from the Gln269 → Pro mutation in the leptin receptor of the Zucker fatty rat may be due not only to a reduced cell surface expression of this form of the leptin receptor, but also to a post-leptin binding malfunction of the receptor that interferes with subsequent signal transduction.

Current models propose that the choroid plexus, a site of high expression of the short form of the leptin receptor, serves as the site of leptin transport from the serum to the cerebrospinal fluid (13Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Huang W. Jaspan J.B. Maness L.M. Peptides. 1996; 17: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Once leptin crosses the blood brain barrier and reaches the cerebrospinal fluid, it interacts with the long form of the leptin receptor located in the hypothalamus and exerts its effects on metabolism (13Banks W.A.

In this report, we utilized a multifaceted approach to investigate the Zucker fatty rat leptin receptor mutation and an additional Gln → Pro mutation at the vicinal glutamine two amino acids upstream of the glutamine mutated in the Zucker fatty rat. Wild type receptor and each of these mutants were analyzed for cell surface and/or intracellular receptor protein levels in three different systems: 1) chimeric OB-R/erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) constructs, 2) a short form of the OB-R, and 3) the soluble form of OB-R. In addition, in the case of the OB-R/EPO-R chimeras we also looked at the ability of each of the receptors to elicit a mitogenic response. Each of these different receptor constructs allowed us to ask specific questions about the function and/or the fate of receptors bearing a point mutation in the ligand binding domain of the leptin receptor. Using bioassays, biotin-leptin, and an OB-R polyclonal antibody, we demonstrate that the fatty receptors are able to bind leptin but that few of the receptors ever make it to the cell surface. Regardless of the cell system or receptor used (OB-R/EPO-R, OB-R short form, or soluble OB-R), similar expression patterns were observed. This is the first report to our knowledge that specifically distinguishes between cell surface and intracellular leptin receptors via the use of a leptin receptor antibody. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the importance of this particular domain within the extracellular ligand binding region of the leptin receptor in terms of influencing cell surface expression levels and post-ligand binding leptin receptor signaling.

Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from JRH Bioscience. [3H]Thymidine was purchased from ICN. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a soluble human leptin receptor/human Ig Fc fusion protein according to standard techniques. The antibodies were affinity-purified using a human leptin receptor column and conjugated to fluorescein (6-(fluorescein-5-carboxamidohexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to standard protocols.

Murine EPO-R cDNA sequence has been previously reported (27D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Wong G.G. Cell. 1989; 57: 277-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). DNA sequences encoding chimeric OB-R/EPO-R were generated by a two-step polymerase chain reaction (28Higuchi R. Innis M. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989: 177-183Google Scholar) and contain the extracellular domain of the human OB-R (amino acids 1–841) and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the murine EPO-R (amino acids 272–507). Introduction of the Z and Z′ mutations into the OB-R/EPO-R cDNA was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using a two-step polymerase chain reaction protocol (28Higuchi R. Innis M. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989: 177-183Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed to be correct by DNA sequencing. Chimeric receptor DNAs were subcloned into pLJ, a eukaryotic vector (29Korman A.J. Frantz J.D. Strominger J.L. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

OB-R short forms were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1− (Invitrogen). Soluble OB-R forms were subcloned into pCEP4 (Invitrogen). 32D (clone 3) cells (30Ihle J.N. Peppersack L. Rebar L. J.

COS-7 and 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (high glucose) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. 32D transfections were carried out by electroporating (1.2 kV at 25 microfarads) 107 cells with 30 μg of DNA. Following a 24-h recovery period, transfectants were selected in 750 μg/ml of active G418 (Life Technologies), and positive clones were pooled. COS-7 transfections were carried out in either 96-well flat bottom plates or eight-well chamber slides (Falcon) using Superfect (Qiagen). For 96-well plate transfections, 6 × 103 cells/well were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA; for eight-well chamber slide transfections, 2.5 × 104cells/well were transfected with 1 μg of DNA. After 2 h, the DNA was removed from the cells and replaced with fresh growth media. Transfectants were analyzed 24 h later. 293 transfections were carried out in six-well dishes. 5 × 105 cells/well were transfected with 2 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies). After 4–6 h, DNA was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM, 5% FBS. Approximately 12 h later, media were removed, and the cells were washed. Cells were then incubated with either DMEM and 5% FBS or DMEM (no serum). After 48 h, media and/or lysates were collected. 32D cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove IL-3 and seeded into 96-well U-bottom plates at 5000 cells/well in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS. IL-3, various doses of leptin or additional RPMI 1640 and 10% FBS were added, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was added, and cells were labeled for 4 h. Cells were harvested, and incorporated (ethanol-precipitable) radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting in a Betaplate reader (Wallac). For 32D cell transfectant staining, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with either 5 μg/ml biotin-leptin or 3 μg/ml fluorescein-OB-R antibody for 1 h on ice. In the case of biotin-leptin staining, an additional counterstaining step with streptavidin-phycoerythrin for 30–60 min on ice was performed. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold PBS and 0.5% bovine serum albumin and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Viable cells were selected by gating on forward and side scatter. Cell surface and intracellular localization of leptin receptors in COS-7 transfectants was examined by fluorescence immunostaining and analysis using both laser-based confocal microscopy (Meridian ACAS Ultima) and standard fluorescence microscopy (Nikon E800). Transfected cells were processed in either 96- or eight-well chamber slides. For staining of cell surface receptors, media were removed, and the cells were stained as described above for flow cytometry. Stained cells were then analyzed using the adherent cell analysis and sorting (ACAS) confocal microscope. For evaluation of intracellular receptor stores, media were removed from the cells, and the cells were then fixed and permeabilized with a 1:1 mixture of methanol and acetone for 90 s followed by a PBS wash. Staining of leptin receptors with either fluorescein anti-OB-R or biotin-leptin was performed as described above. Fluorescence analysis by laser-based confocal microscopy was performed at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and emission was measured using a 530/30 nm band pass filter. Phycoerythrin data were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and emission was measured using a 585/42-nm band pass filter. Colocalization experiments were performed by staining with either the ER (anti-PDI at 1:400) or the Golgi (anti-58K at 1:600) marker antibodies in PBS, 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Following two washes in PBS, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with both the Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and the OB-R fluorescein-conjugated polyclonal antibody. Fluorescence analysis by laser-based confocal microscopy was performed at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and emission was measured using a 530/30 nm band pass filter. Phycoerythrin data were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and emission was measured using a 585/42 nm band pass filter. For subcellular localization analysis, cells were analyzed by standard fluorescence microscopy using × 40 magnification and oil immersion on a Nikon Eclipse 800 photomicroscope. For Western blot analysis, equal volumes of 1× conditioned media were denatured in Laemmli buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared by solubilizing the cells in lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μm NaVO4, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1.0 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and denatured in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through 6% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed using a 1 μg/ml solution of OB-R polyclonal antibody in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris base), 0.1% Tween 20 followed by staining with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to establish a cell-based assay system that would allow for the functional analysis of the interaction between leptin and the leptin receptor ligand binding domain, we utilized the IL-3-dependent 32D cell line and a chimeric receptor approach that has been well characterized in our laboratory (33Pacifici R.E. Thomason A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1571-1574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32D cells are strictly dependent on IL-3 for their growth and survival. However, the cells can be rendered responsive to another factor upon introduction of the cognate receptor for that particular factor (33Pacifici R.E. Thomason A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1571-1574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We capitalized on this observation and created a chimeric receptor, comprising the extracellular ligand binding domain of the human OB-R and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the murine EPO-R, a receptor in the same superfamily as OB-R and previously shown to be signaling-competent in 32D cells (33Pacifici R.E. Thomason A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1571-1574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting chimeric receptor is called OBECA (Fig. 1) (OB for OB-R; E for EPO-R; C for chimera; A for wild type). This system provides a functional readout based on the ability of the extracellular domain of the chimeric receptor to interact with its ligand, engage in any typical post-ligand binding activities (e.g. dimerization), activate the receptor, and ultimately elicit a mitogenic response. Neomycin- and leptin-selected 32D OBECA cells were treated with various doses of leptin and assayed for their ability to incorporate tritiated thymidine as an indicator of mitogenic response. The results are shown in Fig. 2 A. A dose-dependent increase in tritiated thymidine uptake was observed in 32D cells expressing the OBECA receptor, demonstrating its functionality. We next generated two point mutations in our chimeric receptor. One, referred to as OBECZ, corresponds to the point mutation seen in the fatty rat (human OB-R amino acid Gln270 → Pro) (Fig. 1). The other, OBECZ′, is a single nucleotide change that creates a Gln → Pro substitution at amino acid 268 (Fig. 1). It should be noted that the numbering of the mutations is different between the rat and human leptin receptors due to the naturally occurring insertion of an amino acid in the human leptin receptor at residue 193 (5Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng Z. Deng N. Culpepper J. Devos R. Richards G.J. Campfield L.A. Clark F.T. Deds J. Muir C. Sanker S. Moriarty A. Moore K.J. Smutko J.S. Mays G.G. Woolf E.A. Monroe C.A. Tepper R.I.

Commun. 1996; 222: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Both of these constructs as well as OBECA were expressed in 32D cells and assayed for leptin responsiveness using the tritiated thymidine uptake bioassay. The results are shown in Fig. 2 B. Only 32D OBECA cells show an increase in tritiated thymidine uptake in response to leptin. The response of 32D OBECA cells to leptin is not as strong as that observed in Fig. 2 A due to the fact that the cells have not been leptin-selected prior to their use in this assay. Neither 32D OBECZ, 32D OBECZ′, nor 32D vector control cells were leptin-responsive. Similar results were obtained when each cell population was subjected to growth selection in leptin;i.e. only 32D OBECA cells were able to survive and proliferate in medium containing leptin (data not shown). These results demonstrate that introduction of either of two distinct point mutations in the ligand binding domain of an OB-R/EPO-R chimera abolishes leptin responsiveness in 32D cells stably expressing these receptors.Figure 2Leptin stimulation of DNA synthesis in 32D transfectants. Leptin-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake is expressed as a percentage of maximal stimulation (IL-3) minus background (no addition). 32D cell transfectants were washed free of IL-3 and incubated with the indicated dose of leptin for 48 h. The data represent the average of triplicate values. A, dose-response curve of leptin-selected 32D OBECA cells. B, 32D OBECZ and OBECZ′ cells are not responsive to leptin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since the above observation could be attributed to either an inability to bind leptin or an absence of receptors on the cell surface, we next sought to determine if there was any detectable difference between the cell surface expression levels of each of the chimeric receptors. We utilized biotin-leptin as well as an OB-R polyclonal antibody, since any staining intensity differences seen using only a leptin analog could be attributed to a change in affinity of the receptor for leptin, as opposed to a true decrease in receptor number on the cell surface. Fig. 3 A shows 32D cells expressing each of the receptor chimera constructs stained with biotin-leptin and analyzed by flow cytometry. A distinct shift in fluorescence over background is seen when 32D OBECA cells are stained with biotin-leptin. However, 32D OBECZ cells show no detectable cell surface staining when incubated with biotin-leptin. 32D OBECZ′ cells show a reduced cell surface expression level by biotin-leptin staining at an intensity between background and wild type chimera levels. Confirmation of these results was obtained when the cells were stained with an OB-R polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3 B). The cell surface expression patterns seen in each cell line parallel that observed when the cells were stained with biotin-leptin. These results demonstrate that OB-R/EPO-R chimeric receptors containing the fatty mutation do not reach the cell surface, or are present at amounts below the level of detection of this method and that the corresponding Gln → Pro mutation at the vicinal glutamine two amino acids upstream of thefatty mutation results in a reduced level of receptor on the cell surface. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that OBECZ′ receptors are still able to bind leptin but are apparently not signaling-competent (see Fig. 2 B). We next sought to determine the mechanism responsible for the differences in cell surface expression of each of the receptor constructs. A decrease in protein levels could be attributable to a transcriptional, translational, or post-translational event. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that all 32D transfectants were expressing comparable mRNA levels of each of the receptor constructs (data not shown), strongly suggesting that the difference in cell surface receptor levels was not due to differences in transcription or mRNA stability. Whereas 32D cells are an excellent system in which to functionally analyze receptor constructs, they are not particularly amenable to visualizing intracellular protein levels due to the fact that they have a large nucleus, which obscures most of the cytoplasm. We were interested in performing indirect immunofluorescence microscopy studies on permea"
https://openalex.org/W2005534661,"The chicken lysozyme gene domain is distinguished by a broad knowledge of how its expression is regulated. Here, we examined the in vivo replication of the lysozyme gene locus using polymerase chain reaction amplification and competitive polymerase chain reaction of size-fractionated, nascent DNA strands. We found that DNA replication initiates at multiple sites within a broad initiation zone spanning at least 20 kilobases, which includes most of the lysozyme gene domain. The 5′ border of this zone is probably located downstream of the lysozyme 5′ nuclear matrix attachment region. Preferred initiation occurs in a 3′-located subzone. The initiation zone at the lysozyme gene locus is also active in nonexpressing liver DU249 cells. Furthermore, examining the timing of DNA replication at the lysozyme gene locus revealed that the gene locus replicates early during S phase in both HD11 and DU249 cells, irrespective of its transcriptional activity."

MHC class II α and β subunits form a non-covalent heterodimer on the cell surface of a restricted subset of mammalian cell types (e.g. mature B-cells, activated T-cells, macrophages, and the thymic epithelium), and their expression is modulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by a variety of cytokines, lymphokines, and hormones (reviewed in Refs. 3Benoist C.

Additionally, in B lymphocytes MHC class II proteins are regulated in a stage-specific manner, as the high level of constitutive expression observed in mature B-cells is completely extinguished during progression to the plasma B-cell stage through repression at the transcriptional level (7Dellabona P.

The X-box contains two separable functional elements: X1 and X2, where the X1 motif binds the regulatory factor X (RFX) family of transcription factors (13Miwa K. Doyle C. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl.

Proteins that interact with the X- and Y-box elements function in a cooperative manner because alterations in their spacing lead to significant reduction in in vivo promoter activity (19Vilen B.J.

NF-Y binding sites are frequently located within ∼50–80 base pairs of promoter transcriptional initiation sites, and also in more distal enhancer control regions of eukaryotic genes (22Wright K.L.

In these contexts, the ubiquitous NF-Y factor is often juxtaposed with other general or tissue-restricted transcription factors, which together mediate crucial functional steps in constitutive and inducible gene regulation. For example, cooperative protein interactions between NF-Y and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), and C/EBP-related proteins, DBP and LAP, have been observed in the murine albumin promoter (23Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), between NF-Y and the serum response factor, p67SRF, in the human β-actin promoter (24Danilition S.L.

Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and the rat liver CCAAT-box factor (CBF) (27Hatamochi A. Golumbek P.T. Van Schaftingen E. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5940-5947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed that specific CCAAT-box DNA binding activity was lost following ion exchange chromatography, but could be restored by recombining two separate column fractions. The two HeLa column fractions, A and B, could also be recombined with the separated Saccharomyces cerevisiaesubunit fractions, HAP2 and HAP3, to reconstitute specific CCAAT-box binding activity (28Chodosh L.A. Olesen J. Hahn S. Baldwin A.S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These results suggested a heterodimeric structure for this CCAAT-box factor, which appeared to have been highly conserved in eukaryotes (26Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A.

Recently, the NF-Y complex has been shown to interact functionally with the non-histone chromosomal high mobility group protein, HMG-I(Y), and a protein-protein interaction site mapped to the NF-YA DNA-subunit interaction domain (DBD) in NF-Y, and the AT-hook motif in HMG-I(Y) (39Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Lack of appropriate MHC class II expression in humans results in a severe autosomal recessive immunodeficient condition known as bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) (6Mach B. Steimle V. Martinez-Soria E. Reith W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 301-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The class II− mutant B-cells in BLS subgroup type II synthesize normal levels of MHC class I, and class II-associated invariant chain proteins, whereas expression of all class II isotypes is universally extinguished. The B-cell-specific gene product, class II transactivator (CIITA), represents the defective gene product in BLS group II class II− cell lines, and is capable of fully restoring class II gene transcription in this specific genetic complementation group (40Steimle V. Otten L.A. Zufferey M. Mach B. Cell. 1993; 75: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). CIITA has been shown to regulate both constitutive class II transcription in mature B-cells (40Steimle V. Otten L.A. Zufferey M. Mach B. Cell. 1993; 75: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), and mediate interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced expression of MHC class II genes during monocyte/macrophage cell differentiation, and in several class II− cell lines (41Steimle V.

Med. 1994; 180: 1367-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In addition, endogenous CIITA mRNA expression has been shown to be completely suppressed in plasma B-cells, whereas unregulated overexpression of CIITA in plasma B-cells surprisingly restores MHC class II mRNA and protein expression to the elevated levels observed in mature B-cells (43Silacci P. Mottet A. Steimle V. Reith W. Mach B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These results suggest active repression of CIITA expression accounts for the dominant suppressor plasma cell phenotype exhibited by mature B:plasma B-cell somatic cell hybrids (7Dellabona P. Latron F. Maffei A. Scarpellino L. Accolla R.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2902-2910PubMed Google Scholar, 8Latron F. Jotterand-Bellomo M. Maffei A. Scarpellino L. Bernard M. Strominger J.L. Accolla R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Positive cofactor 4 (PC4), also referred to as p15 (44Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 45Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), was initially identified as an abundant nuclear protein in murine plasmacytoma cells (46Ballard D.W. Philbrick W.M. Bothwell A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8450-8457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cloned independently on the basis of its differential expression in rat embryo cells and B-cell tumors (47Soma G.-I. Kitahara N. Andoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the ability of this protein to bind polydeoxypyrimidines in vitro (46Ballard D.W. Philbrick W.M. Bothwell A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8450-8457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, PC4/p15 was shown to function as a general transcription accessory factor in the response of RNA polymerase II to upstream activator proteins in in vitroreconstituted systems (44Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 45Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated PC4, as modified by casein kinase II (CKII), has been shown to be functionally inactive in reconstituted cell-free in vitro transcription assays, whereas both the purified native non-phosphorylated, andEscherichia coli derived forms of PC4, are potent transcriptional activators in vitro (45Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 48Ge H. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12691-12695Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, recent results suggest that PC4 regulation may occur while tethered to specific promoter transcription factors, such as NF-Y (39Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this report, the biochemical ion exchange properties of the NF-Y complex were examined in stage-specific B lymphocytes, and compared with a series of BLS mutant cell lines to determine if tissue-specific changes in NF-Y structure occur during stages of active and inactive MHC class II gene transcription. The NF-Y complex in class II+ mature B lymphocytes was observed to bind as an intact trimeric complex to anion exchangers. In contrast, the NF-Y complex derived from class II− plasma B-cells dissociated into discrete NF-YA and NF-YB:C subunit fractions following anion exchange chromatography. A protein fraction derived from mature B-cell nuclei, the NF-Y-associated factors (YAFs), in addition to recombinant PC4, restored Q+ binding to the plasma B-cell NF-Y complex as an intact trimeric complex. These results suggest that, in MHC class II mature B-cells, PC4 functions to stabilize both NF-YA:B:C subunit interactions, as well as NF-Y:CCAAT-box DNA interactions, and further suggest PC4 plays important transactivator/transrepressor roles in MHC class II gene transcription during B-cell development. Human PC4 was cloned from pPC4 2T (39Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI site of pGEX2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using polymerase chain reaction. GST-PC4 mutants were derived from pPC4 2T using polymerase chain reaction, and cloned into theBamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX2TK. pPC4 (ΔC37) contains the N-terminal 90 amino acids of PC4 (nucleotides 1–270 as defined; Ref. 44Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), pPC4(ΔN64) contains the C-terminal 63 amino acids (nucleotides 193–384), and pPC4(C37) contains the C-terminal 37 amino acids of PC4 (nucleotides 271–384). pYA (DBDΔC23) was prepared by digesting pYA(DBD) (39Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with StyI-EcoRI, followed by treatment with the large subunit of DNA polymerase I (Klenow) under standard conditions to generate blunt-ends (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The purified YA(DBD) fragment was ligated and plasmids that lacked the C-terminal 23 amino acids of YA(DBD) (nucleotides 1011–1081, as defined in Ref. 18van Huijsduijnen R.H. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) were identified. Plasmids were prepared and verified using standard techniques (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cloning, expression, and purification of His-YB, His-YC, glutathioneS-transferase (GST), and GST fusion proteins (YA, YA(DBD), YA(ΔDBD), PC4, Dr1, TFIIB, and HAP2(DBD)), and 32P labeling of recombinant proteins using CKII, and heart muscle creatine kinase (HMK) have been described previously (39Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GST-PC4(ΔC37), GST-PC4(C37), GST-PC4(ΔN64), and GST-YA(DBDΔC23) were expressed inE. coli DH5α, and purified from the soluble fraction as described previously (39Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thrombin cleaved recombinant proteins, YA(DBD) and PC4, were further purified to >95% by centrifugation through Centricon 30 filtration devices (Amicon) in BC-420 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.42 m KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and stored at −80 °C following buffer exchange to BC-100 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.1 m KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using Centricon 10 devices (Amicon). Cell lines were kindly provided for these studies as follows: A20 (J. Durdik, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR), Raji (J. Jones, National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, CO), RJ2.2.5 (B. Mach, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland), RM3 (M. Peterlin, University of California, San Francisco, CA), and 6.1.6 (D. Pious, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). MPC11 cells were obtained from the ATCC, Rockille, MD. Lymphocyte cell lines were maintained in suspension culture at ∼106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) which contained 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Cell lines were routinely tested for cell surface MHC class II protein using FITC-conjugated species-specific anti-class II antibodies (PharMingen) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. A20 and Raji cells express high levels of surface MHC class II protein, whereas all other class II− cell lines tested did not express measurable surface class II molecules. 2R. A. Currie, unpublished data. Nuclear extracts were prepared from these, and other cell lines, according to the method of Dignam et al. (50Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar), and as described previously (39Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were passed over DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma) in BC-420 to remove residual nucleic acids, and the flow-through fraction was dialyzed for 5 h against BC-100 using a 10–12-kDa cut-off cellulose membrane (Life Technologies, Inc.). Extracts were centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (10,000 rpm for 10 min) at 4 °C following dialysis to remove insoluble material, and aliquots of the supernatant frozen at −80 °C. Nuclear extract protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Life Technologies, Inc.) as the protein standard (51Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar), and ranged between ∼5–15 mg/ml. EMSA assays, and the preparation and use of the Eα, and S-collagen CCAAT-box oligonucleotides in EMSA has been described previously (39Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30880-30888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 32P-Eα DNA oligomer was used in EMSA to normalize nuclear extracts for relative NF-Y CCAAT DNA binding activities for use in comparative chromatographic analyses. In EMSA, protein fractions were mixed with ∼2 μg of the nonspecific DNA competitor, poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), prior to addition of ∼0.2 ng of 32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe in a 30-μl binding reaction. Binding reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min, then loaded onto a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (30:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio) containing 50 mm Tris, 50 mm boric acid, 1.0 mm EDTA (0.5 × TBE). Gels were electrophoresed at ∼150 V for 1.5 h following pre-running for 30 min at room temperature using 0.5 × TBE as the running buffer. Dried gels were exposed to XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen (DuPont) at −80 °C. Anion exchangers, Q+Sepharose, DEAE-Sepharose, and the cation exchanger, S−Sepharose, were prepared according to the manufacturer's specifications (Sigma), and equilibrated in BC-100. Nuclear extracts were depleted of YAF proteins by first passing extracts over DEAE-Sepharose in BC-420, followed by dialysis against several changes of BC-420 over an 8-h period using a Spectra/Por 6 (25-kDa cut-off) cellulose membrane (Spectrum). Subsequently, extracts were dialyzed against BC-100 for 4 h and stored at −80 °C, following centrifugation to remove insoluble material. The NF-YA subunit was prepared from YAF-depleted nuclear extracts by heating nuclear extracts to 65 °C for 5 min, placing extracts on ice for 15 min, then centrifuging (10,000 rpm for 10 min) at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material. NF-YB:C is effectively inactivated following this heat treatment step (37Maity S.N. Sinha S. Ruteshouser E.C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16574-16580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NF-YA was further purified by passing this material over Q+Sepharose equilibrated in BC-100, and collecting the flow-through fraction (27Hatamochi A. Golumbek P.T. Van Schaftingen E. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5940-5947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NF-YA was concentrated using Centricon 10 filtration devices, stored in BC-100 at −80 °C, and used to complement NF-YB:C activity in recombination experiments. NF-YB:C subunits were isolated following Q+ and S− Sepharose chromatographic separations, as described previously (27Hatamochi A. Golumbek P.T. Van Schaftingen E. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5940-5947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Maity S.N. Sinha S. Ruteshouser E.C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16574-16580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. A20 and MPC11 nuclear extracts, depleted of YAF proteins as described above, were applied to a Q+ Sepharose column in BC- 100 (Tris-HCl buffer). Following extensive washing with BC-100, NF-YB:C was step-eluted using BC-600 (0.6 m KCl), and dialyzed against BC-100 buffer where HEPES had been substituted for Tris- HCl. This material was loaded onto a S− Sepharose column, and eluted using BC-100 (HEPES). NF-YB:C elutes in the flow-through fraction, whereas residual NF-YA activity binds tightly to S−Sepharose under these conditions (27Hatamochi A. Golumbek P.T. Van Schaftingen E. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5940-5947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-YB:C fractions in each case were concentrated using a Centricon 10 filtration device, and the buffer was exchanged to BC-100 (Tris-HCl). NF-YB:C fractions were stored at −80 °C, and used to complement the NF-YA subunit in recombination experiments. The elution position of separated NF-Y subunit"
https://openalex.org/W2072735043,"Interactions between the dephosphorylated regulatory light chains (RLCs) of smooth muscle myosin are involved in maintaining the enzymatically “off” state. Expressed chimeric smooth muscle heavy meromyosins containing skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain (HC) sequences were used to assess the relative importance of the light chain-binding domain (or “neck”) to regulation. Surprisingly, regulation remained intact with a skeletal RLC-binding site. A chimera with the entire α-helical neck composed of skeletal HC sequence showed 2-fold regulation of motility and nearly 5-fold regulation of actin-activated ATPase activity. Complete activation of the dephosphorylated state (i.e. complete loss of regulation) occurred when skeletal HC sequence extended from the head/rod junction to the SH1-SH2 helix. Smooth muscle-specific sequences near the motor domain may therefore position the regulatory domain in a way that optimizes RLC-rod-head interactions, thus enabling a completely off state when the RLC is dephosphorylated. Conversely, a chimera that joins the motor domain from unconventional myosin V to the smooth muscle myosin neck and rod showed only 2-fold regulation. The presence of the smooth muscle light chain-binding region and rod is therefore not sufficient to confer complete phosphorylation-dependent regulation upon all motor domains of the myosin family.

The presence of the smooth muscle light chain-binding region and rod is therefore not sufficient to confer complete phosphorylation-dependent regulation upon all motor domains of the myosin family. It is well established from biochemical studies that the activity and motor properties of smooth muscle myosin are controlled by regulatory light chain (RLC) 1The abbreviations used are: RLC, regulatory light chain; HMM, heavy meromyosin; LC, myosin light chain; HC, myosin heavy chain; ELC, myosin essential light chain. 1The abbreviations used are: RLC, regulatory light chain; HMM, heavy meromyosin; LC, myosin light chain; HC, myosin heavy chain; ELC, myosin essential light chain.phosphorylation. The low activity in the dephosphorylated state is increased several hundredfold upon Ser-19 phosphorylation (1Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15815-15819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle myosin has a homologous serine in the N-terminal region of the RLC, but this molecule is active even when dephosphorylated. These observations raise the question of which domains/sequences of the smooth muscle myosin molecule are essential to ensure regulation and, conversely, which sequences of skeletal muscle myosin preclude its ability to regulate phosphate release. The structure of the myosin head shows two distinct domains: a motor domain with catalytic and actin binding properties and an extended neck region (“regulatory domain”) that consists of the essential and regulatory light chains and the α-helical heavy chain to which they bind (2Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). Given this structural design, it is possible that isoform-specific sequences in the neck might be sufficient to determine whether or not that motor's activity can be regulated. Although interactions between RLCs on the two heads are thought to be important in maintaining the inhibited state, this subunit alone is not sufficient to determine if myosin is regulated. Skeletal muscle myosin RLC, when exchanged into smooth muscle myosin, had the unexpected effect of putting the molecule permanently into an “off” state even when phosphorylated (3Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, skeletal muscle myosin with a smooth muscle RLC does not acquire phosphorylation-dependent regulation of activity, but remains active irrespective of RLC phosphorylation (4Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). A chimeric HMM consisting of a skeletal motor domain and the neck and rod from smooth muscle myosin was recently shown to decrease its actin-activated ATPase activity from 4.3 to 0.5 s−1 upon dephosphorylation (5Sata M. Stafford W.F. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This result suggested that the presence of the smooth muscle LC-binding region conferred the motor domain with the ability to inhibit phosphate release. The motility of the phosphorylated chimera, however, was unexpectedly low (0.12 μm/s), and thus, this construct also has some inexplicable features. These data were interpreted as supporting the idea that the regulatory domain is the sole determinant of regulation. It was previously shown, however, that mutations in the motor domain of smooth muscle HMM can result in the loss of the inhibited state, despite the fact that its regulatory domain and rod are intact. When the sequence of the “actin-binding loop,” which bridges the 50- and 20-kDa tryptic domains of the myosin head, was mutated to that found in skeletal muscle myosin, the chimera was equally active when dephosphorylated or phosphorylated, with actin-activated ATPase values at least as high as that seen in the wild-type progenitor (6Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The major conclusion from this study was that sequences in the motor domain are capable of precluding regulation, despite the presence of a native neck and rod region. When considering the nature of the regulatory interactions in smooth muscle, it is important to remember that the presence of an α-helical coiled-coil rod is also necessary for regulation (7Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The myosin II source is unimportant, as long as the length of the rod is minimally the length of the myosin head. The charge distribution of the rod, which is a conserved feature among myosin II rods, is likely to be important in the interactions that the rod contributes to stabilizing the off state. Here, we assess the properties of two types of chimeric HMMs to test the hypothesis that the light chain-binding domain (attached to a myosin rod) is the sole or at least a major determinant of regulation. The first type of chimera contains predominantly smooth muscle myosin sequence and increasing amounts of skeletal sequence, starting from the invariant proline and extending through the neck region into the motor domain. The complementary chimera joins the motor domain of unconventional myosin V with the regulatory domain and rod from smooth muscle myosin. When the sequence of the regulatory domain is derived from an unregulated myosin, the chimeric smooth muscle HMM is only partially regulated. The presence of a smooth muscle regulatory domain and rod is not sufficient, however, to confer complete regulation upon every heterologous myosin motor domain. Regulation is therefore not determined by any one region of the structure, but instead depends on multiple weak interactions throughout the molecule. The backbone for the constructs was a smooth muscle heavy meromyosin composed of amino acids 1–1175. The constructs were engineered to contain the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the C terminus of the rod for purification purposes. The chimeric constructs were generated by interchanging smooth and skeletal sequence into which compatible restriction sites either existed or were engineered. Accordingly, XhoI sites were introduced into nucleotides 2131–2136 and 2350–2355 of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (8Yanagisawa M. Hamada Y. Katsuragawa Y. Imamura M. Mikawa T. Masaki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and the comparable regions of the skeletal heavy chain (9Molina M.I. Kropp K.E. Gulick J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6478-6488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ABstEII site exists at nucleotides 2556–2562 of the smooth muscle heavy chain, and a BstEII site was engineered into the comparable region of the skeletal heavy chain. Chimeras were then made by interchanging either XhoI-BstEII fragments (for the Sk 787–852 and Sk 719–852 chimeras) orXhoI-XhoI fragments (for the Sk 719–787 chimera). For the chimeras that introduced skeletal sequence between amino acids 805 and 848, flanking silent mutations were engineered in the smooth myosin heavy chain cDNA to create unique restriction sites. The method of Kunkel (10Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) was followed for mutagenesis. The introduction of silent restriction sites in the smooth sequence flanking the codons for amino acids 805–848 allowed introduction of skeletal sequence via the synthesis and ligation of double-stranded oligonucleotide “linkers.” Point mutations in the RLC-binding site (Q839P and Q839P/W841M) were also introduced by mutagenesis following the method of Kunkel (10Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). The chimera with the murine myosin V motor domain (11Mercer J.A. Seperack P.K. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and the smooth muscle neck and rod was produced by introducing a XhoI site into the myosin V sequence at the point of interchange (coding for amino acids LE at positions 758 and 759 of myosin V). A XhoI site had been previously introduced at the LE sequence of the comparable region of the smooth muscle sequence (amino acids 784–785) for the construction of the Sk 787–852 chimera described above. The sequence at the joining region for this chimera was QVAYLEEERD. The sequence QVAY was derived from myosin V; LE is common to both myosins; and EERD starts the smooth muscle sequence. Recombinant baculovirus was isolated by conventional protocols (12O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Sf9 cells in suspension culture were coinfected with viral particles containing the HMM HC construct and a virus expressing both the smooth muscle regulatory and essential light chains. The cells were harvested at 65–75 h, and the recombinant HMM molecules were purified either by actin binding and release by MgATP (13Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or on an anti-FLAG affinity column (International Biotechnologies Inc.). The expressed HMM was phosphorylated by addition of Ca2+, calmodulin, and myosin light chain kinase and dephosphorylated by addition of protein phosphatase 1-M (gift from T. Haystead). Immunoblots of glycerol gels verified RLC phosphorylation (13Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin-activated ATPase assays were performed in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 8 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgATP at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with SDS at six time points per actin concentration, and inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically (14White H.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The concentration of active heads was determined by NH4+-ATPase activity relative to a myosin standard (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5 at 37 °C, 0.4m NH4Cl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The motility assay was performed at 30 °C in 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% methylcellulose using monoclonal antibody S2.1 or S2.2 for attachment (15Trybus K.M. Henry L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2879-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A series of chimeric constructs were designed to determine if the source of the neck region completely determines whether or not the activity of a myosin motor can be regulated by RLC phosphorylation. The first class of chimeric HMMs that were expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system contained the motor domain from regulated smooth muscle myosin and part or all of the regulatory domain from unregulated skeletal muscle myosin. Fig. 1 shows the sequence comparison of the neck regions of smooth and skeletal muscle myosins. In the 73 residues from Gly-779 to Gln-852 (smooth muscle myosin heavy chain numbering), only 31 amino acids are identical. Thus, there are many isoform-specific sequences in the regulatory domain of myosin that could potentially determine whether or not a myosin motor is regulated. The first chimera that was analyzed (Sk 787–852) contained all smooth muscle HC sequence (amino acids 1–1175), except for amino acids 787–852, which were derived from the skeletal HC sequence. The amino acid sequence LEE (amino acids 784–786) is conserved between these two isoforms and a number of other species, and this sequence was used as the point of interchange. Thus, both the ELC- and RLC-binding sites in this chimera, as well as a limited amount of additional sequence closer to the motor, were derived from an unregulated myosin. Fig. 2 shows the location of the skeletal HC sequences in the three-dimensional structure of the myosin head. Smooth muscle LCs bind well to the skeletal heavy chain sequence (3Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and so this chimera was expressed with either smooth or skeletal muscle LCs since either RLC isoform can be phosphorylated. With smooth LCs, the dephosphorylated skeletal neck chimera (Sk 787–852) moved actin at half the rate of the phosphorylated chimera (Fig. 3 B and TableI), and thus, a significant degree of regulation was lost. The average rate of motility in the phosphorylated state was 1.31 ± 0.19 μm/s, compared with 1.12 ± 0.15 μm/s for the wild-type HMM control, showing that the chimeric construct did not compromise the molecule's motor properties. The average actin-activated ATPase activity of the dephosphorylated chimera was one-fourth of that in the phosphorylated state (0.41 s−1 versus 1.95 s−1,n = 3) (Fig. 4 A and Table I). Thus, the ratio of activation (dephosphorylated/phosphorylated) is somewhat different when determined by ATPase activity and by motility. This discrepancy is in part due to the fact that the ATPase activity of the phosphorylated chimera was higher than that obtained with wild-type HMM (Table I), yet this increased ATPase activity did not result in a correspondingly higher rate of motility.Table IActin-activated ATPase activity of chimeric HMMs with smooth muscle LCsChimeric HC constructsaExpressed chimeric HMM constructs contain all smooth muscle myosin heavy chain sequence except for the amino acids indicated, which were derived from the chicken fast skeletal heavy chain sequence.

Dephosphorylated and phosphorylated samples were done in parallel for each preparation. With skeletal LCs, the dephosphorylated chimera (Sk 787–852) moved actin at half of the rate of the phosphorylated construct. The average rate of motility obtained with phosphorylated skeletal RLC was 0.60 ± 0.10 μm/s (Fig. 3 B and TableII), lower than that of control wild-type HMM. It should be noted, however, that wild-type HMM with skeletal LCs did not move actin at all in a motility assay (Fig. 3 A), a result that was previously reported (3Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the incorporation of skeletal HC sequence in the neck actually overrides the inhibition imposed by the skeletal RLC when bound to the smooth muscle myosin neck. The actin-activated ATPase activity of the construct with skeletal LCs was lower than that obtained with smooth LCs, qualitatively consistent with the reduced rate of motility observed when skeletal LCs were bound to this chimera (Fig. 4 C and Table II).Table IIActin-activated ATPase activity of chimeric HMMs with skeletal muscle LCsChimeric HC constructsActin-activated ATPase activityMotilityDephos. aDephos., dephosphorylated; Phos., phosphorylated; D/P, dephosphorylated/phosphorylated.

Open table in a new tab See the Table I legend for details. The construct described above retained 3 smooth muscle-specific residues at the beginning of the α-helix (residues 780–783; see Fig. 1). To rule out the possibility that these residues that interact with the motor domain might be the critical determinant for completely activating the dephosphorylated species, the properties of the Sk 781–852 chimera were also determined. They were, however, not significantly different from those of the Sk 787–852 chimera (Fig. 4 A, compare circles and triangles; and Table I). To identify which region of the heavy chain in the neck was responsible for the partial loss of regulation, several other mutants were engineered. The expectation was that the sequence constituting the RLC-binding site would be most important in giving rise to activation of the dephosphorylated state. We therefore first focused on a region of the RLC-binding site that has a distinct bend in it near a sequence that is WQWW (amino acids 838–841) in smooth and scallop myosins and WPWM in skeletal muscle myosin. Mutants with either a single amino acid mutation (Q839P) or a double point mutation (Q839P/W841M), however, had actin-activated ATPase activity and motility that were indistinguishable from those of wild-type HMM (data not shown). Larger pieces of skeletal sequence were next engineered into smooth muscle HMM. One chimera (Sk 827–849) corresponds to skeletal sequence only under the RLC-binding site, and two others (Sk 815–849 and Sk 806–849) contained increasing amounts of skeletal sequence in the region to which the ELC binds (see Figs. 1 and 2 A). The chimera Sk 827–849 resembles wild-type HMM in its motility properties (Fig. 3 C), whereas there is a modest activation of the dephosphorylated state in the Sk 815–849 and Sk 806–849 constructs (Table I). The first chimera to show a high level of motility and activity was the Sk 787–852 construct (described above), in which essentially the entire α-helix has been mutated to skeletal sequence. Changing the entire sequence of the neck region to that found in skeletal muscle myosin significantly activated the dephosphorylated state, but not to the level of the phosphorylated chimera. We therefore made a chimera that consisted of even more skeletal sequence, from the conserved SH1-SH2 helix of the motor domain through the invariant proline that marks the head/rod junction. This chimera has the entire light chain-binding α-helix as well as the domain that has been referred to as the converter region, composed of skeletal sequence (Fig. 2 C). This chimera, unlike the others described, showed complete loss of regulation. It displayed similar activity in the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated states, both with respect to motility (Fig. 3 D) and actin-activated ATPase activity (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, the results obtained with smooth and skeletal LCs were much more similar than in any of the other chimeras. Thus, sequences in both the motor domain and the neck region are required to fully abolish the regulatory capabilities of smooth muscle HMM. To test the possibility that the skeletal sequences in the motor domain were primarily responsible for the loss of regulation, we expressed a chimera (Sk 719–787) that contained skeletal sequence only in the motor domain, from the SH1-SH2 helix to the top of the α-helix to which the light chains bind (i.e. the converter domain) (Fig. 2 D). This chimera was more regulated than Sk 719–852 (Fig. 4 D and Table I), implying that complete loss of regulation was due to a cumulative effect of changes to both the motor and regulatory domains. Despite the high ATPase activity of this chimera (Fig. 4 D), there was a low rate of motility in the phosphorylated state (Table I). The second type of chimera that was engineered consisted of the motor domain from unconventional myosin V joined to the neck and rod from smooth muscle HMM. Myosin V is quite divergent from myosin II, and thus, this chimera is a stringent test of whether the neck region is the sole determinant of regulation. The activity of native myosin V is regulated by calcium binding to calmodulin, which is bound to six IQ motifs in the neck region (16Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). There is also a specific light chain bound to one of the IQ motifs, although at present its position relative to the motor domain has not been established. The strategy used to design the chimeric HMM (myosin V motor domain and smooth neck and rod) was similar to that used to generate the Sk 787–852 chimera (described above), namely the conserved LE sequence (amino acids 784 and 785; see Fig. 1) was used as the point of interchange. Four independent preparations of this chimera showed the following ratios of actin-activated ATPase activities in the dephosphorylated/phosphorylated state: 0.67, 0.54, 0.70, and 0.53 (Table III). This chimera therefore consistently showed less than a 2-fold degree of regulation, establishing that the presence of the smooth muscle myosin neck and LCs is not sufficient to confer this motor with the ability to completely inhibit phosphate release.Table IIIActin-activated ATPase activity of a chimeric HMM with the motor domain from unconventional myosin V and the neck, rod, and light chains from smooth muscle myosinPreparation No.Actin-activated ATPase activityDephos. aDephos., dephosphorylated; Phos., phosphorylated; D/P, dephosphorylated/phosphorylated.

Activities were based on total protein concentration determined with the Bradford reagent since the NH4+-ATPase activity of the myosin V motor domain has not been determined. Smooth muscle myosin's ability to inhibit phosphate release requires multiple interactions to take place, which creates a degree of regulation that is unique in its completeness. At the same time, the sheer number of critical interactions makes the determinants of the off state difficult to define, while easy to perturb. Altering any one of these interactions causes varying degrees of activation of the dephosphorylated state, and thus, a continuum in the observed degree of regulation can be attained. The adjacent head is important for complete inhibition of the dephosphorylated state since dephosphorylated single-headed myosin has two-thirds the activity of phosphorylated single-headed myosin (17Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The rod also plays a role since two heads that were dimerized by addition of a “leucine zipper” coiled-coil, but that contained little or no native rod sequence, were also active when dephosphorylated (7Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Both head-head and head-rod interactions are therefore major elements involved in regulation. The nature of the head-head interactions has not been fully established, but is thought to include interactions between dephosphorylated RLCs on adjacent heads that are abolished upon phosphorylation. Thus, it was expected that a chimera with skeletal HC sequence in the neck region would be active when dephosphorylated since this would presumably perturb RLC-RLC interactions. While this prediction was fulfilled, several aspects of this study were unexpected. One surprising feature was that regulation was essentially unperturbed if only the RLC-binding site was mutated to the skeletal sequence (Sk 827–849). There are numerous sequence differences between smooth and skeletal myosins in this region of the HC (Fig. 1), and based on sequence comparisons alone, one might have predicted that these differences were sufficient to account for whether or not a particular myosin is regulated. The results obtained here, however, imply that the smooth RLC binds similarly to the skeletal and smooth muscle IQ motif sequences, at least with respect to positioning the two lobes of the RLC adequately for regulation. When the entire LC-binding α-helix was changed to skeletal sequence, a degree of regulation still remained. For dephosphorylated HMM to have the same actin-activated ATPase activity and motility as phosphorylated HMM, both the neck region and the converter had to be mutated to skeletal sequence. Changing the converter sequence alone resulted in more activation of ATPase activity than changing the neck sequence alone, but neither chimera produced full activation of the dephosphorylated state. If RLC-RLC interactions play a major role in maintaining the inhibited state, why do sequences nearer the motor domain have a larger activating effect? One way to interpret these results is that sequences near the motor domain dictate the orientation of the neck as it emerges from the motor domain, which ultimately affects the way RLCs on adjacent heads will interact with each other. A comparison of the crystallographic structure of the neck regions from regulated scallop myosin (18Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and unregulated skeletal myosin S1 (2Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar) shows differences in the angle of the HC at the ELC/RLC interface as well as in the RLC-binding site (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 19Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, small changes at the top of the α-helix might be propagated to larger changes in orientation of the RLC-binding site. In support of this idea, a chimeric smooth muscle HMM that contained the HC neck sequence from regulated scallop myosin showed a high degree of regulation by phosphorylation. 2V. Naroditskaga, L. Nyitray, A. G. Szent-Györgyi, and K. M. Trybus, unpublished observations. Thus, incorporation of any foreign sequence in the neck does not necessarily activate the dephosphorylated state. Instead, some feature of the neck that is common to regulated myosins, but that is not conserved in the skeletal muscle myosin neck, determines whether or not a motor with the potential to be regulated does in fact exhibit control of phosphate release. The results described above are consistent with the idea that the neck is involved in interactions necessary to obtain an inhibited state. A more stringent test of whether the regulatory domain is the sole determinant of regulation is to analyze the properties of a chimera with the smooth muscle neck and rod attached to a heterologous motor domain. Using this strategy, it was reported that a chimera containing the motor domain from skeletal muscle myosin and the neck and rod from smooth muscle HMM conferred a 9-fold degree of regulation upon this previously unregulated motor (5Sata M. Stafford W.F. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, the properties of a similar construct containing the motor domain from an unconventional myosin V and the neck and rod from smooth muscle HMM were analyzed. We found less than a 2-fold degree of regulation, suggesting that the smooth muscle neck cannot confer complete regulation upon all motor domains of the myosin superfamily. The inability of the smooth muscle neck to regulate myosin V is consistent with our previous observation that sequences in the motor domain can preclude regulation, even when the construct has a completely native neck and rod derived from smooth muscle myosin (6Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The emerging picture of smooth muscle myosin regulation is that the light chain-binding domain of the myosin HC is only one of the elements necessary for complete regulation. The perturbations that activate dephosphorylated myosin to the greatest extent are as follows: mutations in the actin-binding loop (6Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), mutations in the converter region of the motor domain (this work), removal of one of the myosin heads (17Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and removal of the native myosin rod sequence while retaining a dimeric structure with a leucine zipper (7Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Conversely, substitution of the skeletal RLC for the smooth RLC completely locks the system off (3Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, creation of an inactive state likely begins with interactions between the two native dephosphorylated RLCs, which are then stabilized by interactions between the myosin rod and both heads. The nature of the motor domain is important for regulation since we show here that not all motor domains can be regulated. This study also suggests that, in some way (requiring sequence extending from the RLC-binding site through the converter domain), thepositioning of the regulatory domain of smooth muscle myosin relative to the motor domain is critical and has been optimized to facilitate these RLC-rod-head interactions, thus enabling a completely off state in the absence of RLC phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2076020747,"Yeast zinc cluster proteins form a major class of yeast transcriptional regulators. They usually bind as homodimers to target DNA sequences, with each monomer recognizing a CGG triplet. Orientation and spacing between the CGG triplet specifies the recognition sequence for a given zinc cluster protein. For instance, Gal4p binds to inverted CGG triplets spaced by 11 base pairs whereas Ppr1p recognizes a similar motif but with a spacing of 6 base pairs. Hap1p, another member of this family, binds to a direct repeat consisting of two CGG triplets. Other members of this family, such as Leu3p, also recognize CGG triplets but when oriented in opposite directions, an everted repeat. This implies that the two zinc clusters of Leu3p bound to an everted repeat must be oriented in opposite directions to those of Gal4p or Ppr1p bound to inverted repeats. In order to map the domain responsible for proper orientation of the zinc clusters of Leu3p, we constructed chimeric proteins between Leu3p and Ppr1p and tested their binding to a Leu3p and a Ppr1p site. Our results show that the linker region, which bridges the zinc cluster to the dimerization domain, specifies binding of Leu3p to an everted repeat. We propose that the Leu3p linker projects the two zinc clusters of a Leu3p homodimer in opposite directions allowing binding to everted repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1995469488,"Aromatic amino acid aminotransferase (AroAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) are known as dual-substrate enzymes, which can bind acidic and hydrophobic substrates in the same pocket (Kawaguchi, S., Nobe, Y., Yasuoka, J., Wakamiya, T., Kusumoto, S., and Kuramitsu, S. (1997) J. Biochem.(Tokyo) 122, 55–63). In order to elucidate the mechanism of hydrophobic substrate recognition, kinetic and thermodynamic analyses using substrates with different hydrophobicities were performed. They revealed that 1) amino acid substrate specificity (k max/Kd) depended on the affinity for the substrate (1/Kd) and 2) binding of the hydrophobic side chain was enthalpy-driven, suggesting that van der Waals interactions between the substrate-binding pocket and hydrophobic substrate predominated. Three-dimensional structures of AspAT and AroAT bound to α-aminoheptanoic acid were built using the homology modeling method. A molecular dynamic simulation study suggested that the outward-facing position of the Arg292side chain was the preferred state to a greater extent in AroAT than AspAT, which would make the hydrophobic substrate bound state of the former more stable. Furthermore, AroAT appeared to have a more flexible conformation than AspAT. Such flexibility would be expected to reduce the energetic cost of conformational rearrangement induced by substrate binding. These two mechanisms (positional preference of Arg and flexible conformation) may account for the high activity of AroAT toward hydrophobic substrates. Aromatic amino acid aminotransferase (AroAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) are known as dual-substrate enzymes, which can bind acidic and hydrophobic substrates in the same pocket (Kawaguchi, S., Nobe, Y., Yasuoka, J., Wakamiya, T., Kusumoto, S., and Kuramitsu, S.

Many enzymes show restricted specificities for single chemical types of substrate (1Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 389-452Google Scholar), but some have evolved binding pockets with dual specificities for different chemical groups (aminotransferases (Refs. 2Kuramitsu S. Hiromi K. Hayashi H. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5469-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholarand 3Kawaguchi S. Nobe Y. Yasuoka J. Wakamiya T. Kusumoto S. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1603-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)). Escherichia coli aromatic amino acid aminotransferase (AroAT) 1The abbreviations used are: AroAT, aromatic amino acid aminotransferase; AspAT, aspartate aminotransferase; cAspAT, cytosolic AspAT; mAspAT, mitochondrial AspAT; sCn, α-aliphatic amino acid with a straight side chain bearingn carbon atoms; sCnI, aliphatic acid with a straight side chain bearing n carbon atoms; ksCn, aliphatic α-keto acid with a straight side chain bearing ncarbon atoms; MD, molecular dynamic; PPY,N,5′-phosphopyridoxyl-l-tyrosine; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: AroAT, aromatic amino acid aminotransferase; AspAT, aspartate aminotransferase; cAspAT, cytosolic AspAT; mAspAT, mitochondrial AspAT; sCn, α-aliphatic amino acid with a straight side chain bearingn carbon atoms; sCnI, aliphatic acid with a straight side chain bearing n carbon atoms; ksCn, aliphatic α-keto acid with a straight side chain bearing ncarbon atoms; MD, molecular dynamic; PPY,N,5′-phosphopyridoxyl-l-tyrosine; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate. and aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) are unique in being active toward two entirely different kinds of substrate (acidic and hydrophobic). These enzymes recognize a carboxyl group of an acidic substrate with side chain of arginine residue and recognize hydrophobic substrates in proportion to their hydrophobicities (3Kawaguchi S. Nobe Y. Yasuoka J. Wakamiya T. Kusumoto S. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These two kinds of substrates are accommodated in the one binding pocket of the enzyme. Structural determination and protein engineering techniques have made it relatively easy to define the key residues that recognize the polar and charged groups of a substrate. However, the mechanism responsible for hydrophobic substrate specificity is more complicated, because the complexity of interactions within the substrate binding pocket and multiple protein configurations must be taken into consideration. In many cases, a number of residues contribute to hydrophobic ligand specificity. There are also situations when the residues determining specificity do not interact directly with the substrate. Generally, hydrophobic side chains are well packed in the protein cores and a hydrophobic effect is one of the major factors involved in substrate recognition and protein folding (5Creighton T.E. Proteins. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993: 217-238Google Scholar). So far, three strategies designed to estimate the extent of hydrophobic interaction have been reported. The first involves measuring enzyme affinities for a series of hydrophobic ligands (6Hansch C. Coats E. J. Pharm. Sci. 1970; 59: 731-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Dorovska-Taran V. Momtcheva R. Gulubova N. Martinek K. Biochim. Biophys.

Baase W.A. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8564-8575Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), acyl-coenzyme A-binding protein (11Færgeman N.J. Sigurskjold B.W. Kragelund B.B. Andersen K.V.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1485-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The second involves measuring the effects of a series of mutations on protein stability. Several studies have shown that replacing a residue facing the cavity with a more hydrophobic residue makes proteins more stable (13Jackson S.E. Moracci M. elMasry N. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11259-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 14Yutani K. Ogasahara K. Tsujita T. Sugino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The third involves the use of a series of solvents with different hydrophobicities as the reaction media (20Wangikar P.P. Rich J.O. Clark D.S. Dordick J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12302-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The results obtained suggest that the effect of a hydrophobic interaction varies according to the environment around the site (hydrophobicity, packing density, conformational flexibility, and presence of water). Aminotransferases catalyze the reversible transamination reaction between an α-amino acid and an α-keto acid, which is accompanied by interconversion of the cofactor between pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) (21Kiick D.M. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Jenkins W.T. Fonda M.L. Christen P. Metzler D.E. Transaminases. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 216-234Google Scholar). Amino acid+EL⇄keto acid+EM REACTION1 E L and E M denote the PLP and PMP forms of the enzyme, respectively. Several kinds of aminotransferases with different substrate specificities are known, and they have been classified into four families on the basis of their amino acid sequence homologies (23Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 24Jensen R.A. Gu W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). E. coli AroAT shows high activity toward hydrophobic and acidic substrates (3Kawaguchi S. Nobe Y. Yasuoka J. Wakamiya T. Kusumoto S. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Hayashi H. Inoue K. Nagata T. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12229-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). AroAT is quite similar in many respects to AspAT, which is the most extensively investigated aminotransferase (26John R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar,27Hayashi H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of AspATs from various sources have been determined by x-ray crystallography (28Smith D.L. Almo S.C. Toney M.D. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8161-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 29Okamoto A. Higuchi T. Hirotsu K. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17293-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). E. coli AroAT (31Kuramitsu S. Inoue K. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Kagamiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and AspAT (32Kuramitsu S. Okuno S. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1985; 97: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) show amino acid sequence identities of 43%, and the residues in their catalytic sites are almost fully conserved. Both enzymes have a dimer structure consisting of identical 44-kDa subunits, and their circular dichroism spectra in the far UV region are essentially identical (25Hayashi H. Inoue K. Nagata T. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12229-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The absorption spectra over 300 nm and pKa values of the PLP-Lys Schiff base are also very similar between AspAT and AroAT, which reflect the microenvironment of the active site. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that they have common three-dimensional structures and catalytic mechanisms. The characteristic difference between AspAT and AroAT is the their activity toward hydrophobic substrates; in effect, AroAT shows about 10,000 times higher activity toward phenylalanine than AspAT. Furthermore, the chimera constructed from AspAT and AroAT shows hydrophobic substrate specificities between those of the two parent enzymes (3Kawaguchi S. Nobe Y. Yasuoka J. Wakamiya T. Kusumoto S. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Miyazawa K. Kawaguchi S. Okamoto A. Kato R. Ogawa T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because the substrate-binding pockets of these three enzymes are surrounded by the same set of residues (residues inred in Fig. 1), the mechanism of hydrophobic substrate recognition by aminotransferases has generated considerable interest. Previous studies (3Kawaguchi S. Nobe Y. Yasuoka J. Wakamiya T. Kusumoto S. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have revealed that the size of the substrate side chain is a major factor that determines the enzymatic activity; the free energy stabilizations of AroAT toward a series of hydrophobic substrates are twice those of AspAT. In particular, AroAT shows constant activity toward the hydrophobic unit of a substrate, irrespective of its shape, suggesting that conformational flexibility or plasticity may be related to the hydrophobic substrate specificity of this enzyme (3Kawaguchi S. Nobe Y. Yasuoka J. Wakamiya T. Kusumoto S. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Model structures for AroAT have been proposed (34Seville M. Vincent M.G. Hahn K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8344-8349Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Jäger J. Solmajer T. Jansonius J.N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and subsequently, the structure of an AspAT hexamutant (V39L, K41Y, T47I, N69L, T109S, and N297S) 2The amino acid residues are numbered according to the sequence of pig cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (68Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 2The amino acid residues are numbered according to the sequence of pig cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (68Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). with higher aromatic activity was determined by x-ray crystallography (36Malashkevich V.N. Onuffer J.J. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The hexamutant structure is thought to be a better template for AroAT model building than those used previously. In this study, we re-built an AroAT model in its complexed form with α-aminoheptanoic acid that we expected to be helpful for understanding the hydrophobic substrate specificity of AroAT. Recently, the dynamic natures of proteins have been evaluated using a variety of methods. Increasing instances of multiple conformations of substrates and proteins, even in their crystallographic structures, have been found as the result of advances in the various techniques. Protein dynamics, as well as protein structures, are thought to be hierarchical (37Karplus M. McCammon J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 263-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Not only large scale conformational changes (movements of domains and/or segments), but also relatively small fluctuations, must be biologically important. In this paper, we discuss protein fluctuation, that may be related to van der Waals interactions within the AroAT enzyme and between this enzyme and its substrates. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation has become a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamic natures of macromolecules. We used this technique to investigate the flexibility of AroAT and performed thermodynamic analysis to examine further the effects of hydrophobicity on substrate binding. The plasmid pUC19GpY (3Kawaguchi S. Nobe Y. Yasuoka J. Wakamiya T. Kusumoto S. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) overproducesE. coli AroAT coded by the tyrB gene in theE. coli TY103 strain (38Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Tanase S. Morino Y. Hiromi K. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6079-6085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was derived from the JM103 strain (39Messing J. Crea R. Seeburg P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar), by disrupting the aspC, tyrB, andrecA genes. Cells carrying this plasmid were grown overnight at 37 °C, harvested by centrifugation, frozen, and stored at −20 °C. The enzyme was purified and its concentration determined using the protocols described previously (33Miyazawa K. Kawaguchi S. Okamoto A. Kato R. Ogawa T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After the addition of an amino acid substrate to the PLP form of AroAT, the 360-nm absorption band shifts to 330 nm, which means the PLP form has converted to the PMP form. The converse spectral change is observed with the reaction between a keto acid and the PMP form of AroAT. The substrate concentrations used were high enough to convert the enzyme between the PLP and PMP forms. Under single-turnover conditions, the absorption changes at 360 nm were monitored using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SX-17MV, Applied Photophysics). The dead time was 2.0 ms under the conditions used (7 kg·cm−2). About 10 progress curves for each substrate concentration were recorded and curve-fitting to a single exponential time course was performed using the program provided with SX-17MV. The kinetic parameters were determined using the following model (Reaction 2) and Equation 1. EL+S⇌KdE·S→kmaxES‡ REACTION2 kapp=kmax[S]/(Kd+[S])Equation 1 k app is the apparent rate constant at a given substrate concentration, k max is the maximum rate constant, and Kd is the dissociation constant. For slow kinetic experiments, a Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer was employed. When the k app value was directly proportional to the substrate concentration, Equation 2, instead of Equation 1, was used to determine the catalytic efficiency,k max/Kd(2). kapp=(kmax/Kd)[S]Equation 2 The reaction conditions were 10 μm AroAT, 1–50 mm substrate, 100 mm KCl, 50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, and 15–35 °C. Aliphatic acid competitive inhibitors bind noncovalently to AroAT and form Michaelis complexes. Upon complex formation, the pKa of the internal aldimine, which forms between Nε of Lys258 and C4′ of PLP, increases from 6.8 to over 8.0 (40Jenkins W.T. D'Ari L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5667-5674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Iwasaki M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the conversion from the unprotonated (360 nm) and protonated (430 nm) species can be followed spectrophotometrically. The spectra of the PLP form of AroAT with various concentration of aliphatic acids were recorded using a spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3000). The reaction conditions were 100 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 25 °C, and the protein concentration was about 10 μm. The binding of aliphatic acid inhibitors to the PMP form of AroAT was monitored using a spectropolarimeter (Jasco J-720). The Kd values for the inhibitors were obtained by fitting the absorbances at 430 (PLP form) or 330 nm (PMP form) to theoretical curves using the Igor Pro version 3.01 application (WaveMetrics, Inc.). The free energy change for the fast binding step (ΔG s) was obtained using the equation −RTln(1/Kd), where Ris the gas constant (1.99 cal/K·mol) and T is the absolute temperature, and the enthalpy change (ΔH s) was derived from a van't Hoff equation. δln1Kd/δT=ΔHsRT2Equation 3 This equation is often integrated under the assumption that ΔCp = 0. ln1Kd=lnA−ΔHsRTEquation 4 ΔH s in Equation 4 is the so-called van't Hoff enthalpy. The reactions between the PMP form of the enzyme and keto acid substrates were analyzed using Equation 4. When it is supposed that the enthalpy depends linearly on temperature, the enthalpy change is expressed as shown in Equation 5. ΔHs=ΔHr+ΔCp(T−Tr)Equation 5 ΔH r is the enthalpy change at temperature T r, and ΔCp is the non-zero heat capacity change. Therefore, integration of the van't Hoff equation (Equation 3) yields Equation 6. ln1Kd=ln1Kr+ΔCpR−(1+lnTr)+Tr1T−ln1TEquation 6 K r is the dissociation constant atT r. The reactions between the PLP form of the enzyme and amino acid substrates were analyzed using Equation 6. The entropy change was calculated using the equation ΔG s = ΔH s − TΔS s, and the activation free energy for the rate-determining step (ΔG‡) was calculated using Equation 7. ΔG‡=RTlnkBTh−lnkmaxEquation 7 k B is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−34 J·K−1), and h is the Planck constant (6.63 × 10−34 J·s). The activation energy (E A) was obtained from an Arrhenius plot of the rate constant versus temperature (ln(k max) versus 1/T), and the slope of this plot yields −E A/R. Thus, the enthalpy change (ΔH‡) is calculated using the equation ΔH‡ = E A −RT, and the activation entropy change (ΔS‡) was calculated using the equation ΔG‡ = ΔH‡ −TΔS‡. The x-ray crystallographic structure of the hexamutant of AspAT (Protein Data Bank code 1AHG; see Ref. 36Malashkevich V.N. Onuffer J.J. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) complexed with the cofactor-substrate analog N,5′-phosphopyridoxyl-l-tyrosine (PPY) was used as the model for the hydrophobic substrate ligand-enzyme complex. As the crystallographic structure of AspAT complexed with hydrophobic substrate analog has not been resolved, it was built by reconverting the six mutated residues of the AspAT hexamutant. Modeling of E. coli AspAT and AroAT was carried out using the Homology program (Biosym Technologies). AspAT and its hexamutant have the same number of residues, whereas AroAT is one residue longer. Pro64 was interpreted as an insertion residue, when performing homology modeling of AroAT. The three-dimensional structure data base (Protein Data Bank, Release 76) was searched for the structure of residues 58–70, and the most probable loop structure was chosen as an initial structure and spliced into the AroAT structure in order to fill the insertion gap. The tyrosine residue of PPY in the hexamutant was replaced by α-aminoheptanoic acid (sC7), a double bond between N of sC7 and C4′ of PLP and partial double bonds in the aromatic ring of PLP were introduced and a 5-Å shell of water was added to both the AspAT and AroAT structures. The AspAT and AroAT systems contained water molecules found in the template structure (36Malashkevich V.N. Onuffer J.J. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and a total of 24,279 and 24,391 atoms, respectively. MD simulation was carried out using the Discover version 2.97 program (Biosym Technologies) with the consistent valence force-field. The dielectric constant was fixed at 1.0, and a 14-Å cutoff was used for the nonbonded interactions with a switching function which smoothly turns off the interaction over a range of 1.5 Å. Minimization was performed according to the strategy used by Kasper et al. (42Kasper P. Sterk M. Christen P. Gehring H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, both the AspAT and AroAT systems were subjected first to 500 energy minimization steps with all the heavy atoms fixed and then to 500 steps with all the atoms free to move, using the steepest-descents algorithm. Subsequently, they were subjected to 2000 steps using the conjugate-gradient algorithm. After minimization, the total energies in AspAT and AroAT were −57 Mcal·mol−1and −53 Mcal·mol−1, respectively, and their respective root mean square derivatives were 0.066 and 0.062 kcal·mol−1·Å−1. The temperatures of both systems reached 300 K during the initial 2 ps of MD simulation. The Discover program assigned initial velocities to the atoms in order to maintain a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at a given temperature. The rest of the simulation protocol was run for about 280 and 370 ps for AspAT and AroAT, respectively, at 300 K with a time step of 1 fs, and the molecular coordinates of the molecules were saved every 1 ps. In order to remove the overall translation and rotation of the systems, the backbone N, Cα, and C atoms of 100 conformers (last 100-ps interval of simulation) were superimposed on those of the first conformer within this time interval and each atom position was averaged. The mean square fluctuation was calculated for each Cα atom using Equation 8. 〈ΔR2〉=∑i{(Xi−Xav)2+(Yi−Yav)2+(Zi−Zav)2}/100Equation 8 Xi, Yi, andZi are the Cα coordinates of a given conformer in the 100-ps trajectory; X av,Y av, and Z av are the Cα coordinates of the time-averaged structure. A series of aliphatic substrates of uniform chemical nature was used in this study. The enzymatic activities toward substrates of various hydrophobicities were studied by analyzing the single-turnover reactions (half-reactions) using a stopped-flow apparatus. TableI shows the values ofk max/Kd at 15–35 °C. A temperature increase of 5 °C increased thek max/Kd value for each substrate 2-fold, and the catalytic efficiency increased as the side chain length increased. The energetic contribution of each hydrophobic substrate side chain to the enzymatic activity was evaluated by calculating the ΔG T‡ value using Equation 9 (Scheme FS1) (43Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 311-346Google Scholar). ΔGT‡=RTlnkBTh−lnkmaxKdEquation 9 The ΔG T‡ value decreased as the carbon number of the substrate increased and, consistent with previous studies (3Kawaguchi S. Nobe Y. Yasuoka J. Wakamiya T. Kusumoto S. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 44Onuffer J.J. Ton B.T. Klement I. Kirsch J.F.

The slopes of the straight lines represented the dependence of the enzymatic activity on the hydrophobic unit of the substrate side chain and were referred to as the hydrophobic “substrate specificities.” Over the temperature range tested (15–35 °C), these slopes were almost identical, −1.6 kcal·mol−1. Contrary to expectation, these results suggest that entropy was not a major determinant of the substrate specificity of AroAT, and they may be attributable to strong enthalpy-entropy compensation.Table IThe kmax/Kd (s−1 ·m−1) values for E. coli AroAT with a series of aliphatic substrates at various temperaturesTemperatureSubstratesC3sC4sC5sC6sC7°C150.802.52676011,000201.65.2611,70023,000253.5121503,30043,000305.2262906,20076,00035115154010,000130,000Conditions: 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, pH 8.0. sCn, CH3-(CH2)n−3-CH(NH2)-COOH.

The precore protein is translated from the pre-C AUG on the pre-C RNA, whereas the core protein (the subunit of the capsid) is translated from the C AUG on the pregenomic RNA, a slightly shorter transcript that does not include the pre-C AUG. The precore protein, a 25-kDa unglycosylated protein (P25), is directed to the secretory pathway by a 19-amino acid-long signal sequence that is cleaved during translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (5Junker M.

Virol. 1992; 66: 5338-5346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleaved C-terminal domain of P22 is 34 amino acids long and contains 16 arginine residues arranged in clusters (arginine-rich domain) (Fig. 1 B). Maturation of e antigen from precore protein is similar for two other hepadnaviruses (10Schlicht H.-J. Salfeld J. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3701-3709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Carlier D. Jean-Jean O. Rossignol J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).It has been shown that the cleaved C-terminal domain of P22 is crucial for the efficiency of the HBe secretion process (12Schlicht H.-J. Wasenauer G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6817-6825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Carlier D. Jean-Jean O. Fouillot N. Will H. Rossignol J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1041-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that a cellular protein contributes to the efficiency of this process by a direct or indirect interaction with the P22 C-terminal domain.DISCUSSIONOur study shows that the inhibition of N-glycosylation in cells expressing the HBe precursor led to a significant decrease in HBe secretion, an unexpected finding since the HBe precursor contains no glycosylation consensus sites. A general effect of tunicamycin on the cellular secretion machinery is ruled out as the secretion of HBe−25, HBe−39, and PCLZ was not adversely affected by the inhibitor. Thus, our findings are consistent with the idea that a cellular protein increases specifically HBe secretion and that the activity of this protein (TSP) depends upon theN-glycosylation status of the cell.The molecular mechanism by which TSP increases HBe secretion remains to be determined, although we demonstrate that the tunicamycin sensitivity of secretion absolutely requires a part of the P22 C-terminal domain, a region absent in mature HBe. First, P22 truncations larger than 18 amino acids abolished tunicamycin sensitivity, suggesting that the sequence upstream of position −18 is important for the interaction with TSP. Second, the 39 C-terminal amino acids of P22 conferred tunicamycin sensitivity on PCLZEC39. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a sequence located between amino acids −19 and −39 is involved in the interaction with TSP. However, since in PCLZEC39 both the N- and C-terminal domains of P22 are present, we cannot exclude the possibility that the P22 N terminus may also be involved in this interaction, a possibility not supported by reports on the native structure of HBe (7Schlicht H.-J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3489-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Schödel F. Peterson D. Zheng J. Jones J.E. Hughes J.L. Milich D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1332-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase (22Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.-J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar).How might tunicamycin affect the activity of TSP? The simplest explanation is that TSP is only active when N-glycosylated. Another possibility is that its activity is indirectly affected by tunicamycin. TSP would require the involvement of aN-glycoprotein for its correct folding, processing, subcellular localization, or activity. The next question is how does such a protein function. TSP could be a chaperone that favors the folding of P22, increasing the amount of P22 that exits from the ER and is further transported to the cell surface. The first possibility is that the sequence −19 to −39 promotes the binding of TSP in a direct manner. This seems unlikely since it is generally assumed that, to recognize unfolded proteins, chaperones interact with exposed hydrophobic residues, free exposed sulfhydryl groups, or partially glucose-trimmed oligosaccharides (23Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 24Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), features that are not present in the sequence −19 to −39 (see Fig. 1 B). In particular, we can exclude a direct binding of BiP to this sequence as it has been shown that BiP preferentially binds a heptameric consensus motif containing a subset of aromatic and hydrophobic residues in alternating positions (25Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 26Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), a motif not present in the sequence −19 to −39. Similarly, binding of calnexin can also be ruled out, as this chaperone is a lectin that recognizes specifically partially trimmed, monoglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides (27Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 28Herbert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Involvement of the protein disulfide isomerase can also be excluded, as this chaperone requires hydrophobic interactions and formation of disulfide bonds (30Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the sequence −19 to −39 may promote the binding of TSP to P22 in an indirect manner. This sequence would slow the folding of P22 and thus would indirectly promote the binding of TSP to a folding intermediate, allowing proper folding to proceed.Whatever TSP binds to the sequence −19 to −39 or to another region of P22, abolishment of the N-glycosylation could reduce its chaperone activity as envisaged above. Another possibility is that treatment of cells with tunicamycin for 7 h, which is known to increase significantly the level of ER chaperones, leads to an increased level of TSP, which could consequently slow the export of P22 from the ER as demonstrated with GRP78/BiP for the secretion of different proteins (31Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 32Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Biologicals. 1994; 22: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Muresan Z. Arvan P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Alternatively, TSP could be a “cargo receptor.” Transported (or cargo) proteins are carried from one compartment to the next by small coated vesicles (34Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar) and packaged into these vesicles by nonselective diffusion, a default pathway termed “bulk-flow” (35Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Recent data have shown that, in contrast, some cargo proteins are specifically concentrated into vesicles, in particular at the exit from the ER (36Pelham H.R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 37Aridor M. Balch W.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 38Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). In this selective-transport model, sorting of soluble proteins would be mediated by specialized transmembrane cargo receptors. It is tempting to speculate that TSP would play such a role, mediating the packaging of P22 at one step of its vesicular transport, therefore increasing HBe secretion. So far, none of our data either support or argue against this hypothesis.The role of HBe in the viral life cycle is still unknown (39Ganem D. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, New-York1996: 2703-2737Google Scholar for review). However, recent data have shown that P22 down-regulates the level of HBV replication (40Lambert C. Nassal M. Velhagen I.

Virol. 1997; 71: 345-353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, one might speculate that the relative levels of P22 returned to the cytosol and P22 transported to the cell surface should be controlled and that TSP could be an actor in this repartition. Whether TSP intervenes in vivo during natural HBV infection remains to be determined.

J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the sequence −19 to −39 may promote the binding of TSP to P22 in an indirect manner. This sequence would slow the folding of P22 and thus would indirectly promote the binding of TSP to a folding intermediate, allowing proper folding to proceed.Whatever TSP binds to the sequence −19 to −39 or to another region of P22, abolishment of the N-glycosylation could reduce its chaperone activity as envisaged above. Another possibility is that treatment of cells with tunicamycin for 7 h, which is known to increase significantly the level of ER chaperones, leads to an increased level of TSP, which could consequently slow the export of P22 from the ER as demonstrated with GRP78/BiP for the secretion of different proteins (31Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 32Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Alternatively, TSP could be a “cargo receptor.” Transported (or cargo) proteins are carried from one compartment to the next by small coated vesicles (34Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar) and packaged into these vesicles by nonselective diffusion, a default pathway termed “bulk-flow” (35Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Recent data have shown that, in contrast, some cargo proteins are specifically concentrated into vesicles, in particular at the exit from the ER (36Pelham H.R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 37Aridor M. Balch W.E.

In this selective-transport model, sorting of soluble proteins would be mediated by specialized transmembrane cargo receptors. It is tempting to speculate that TSP would play such a role, mediating the packaging of P22 at one step of its vesicular transport, therefore increasing HBe secretion. So far, none of our data either support or argue against this hypothesis.The role of HBe in the viral life cycle is still unknown (39Ganem D. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, New-York1996: 2703-2737Google Scholar for review). However, recent data have shown that P22 down-regulates the level of HBV replication (40Lambert C. Nassal M. Velhagen I.

Virol. 1997; 71: 345-353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, one might speculate that the relative levels of P22 returned to the cytosol and P22 transported to the cell surface should be controlled and that TSP could be an actor in this repartition. Whether TSP intervenes in vivo during natural HBV infection remains to be determined. Our study shows that the inhibition of N-glycosylation in cells expressing the HBe precursor led to a significant decrease in HBe secretion, an unexpected finding since the HBe precursor contains no glycosylation consensus sites. A general effect of tunicamycin on the cellular secretion machinery is ruled out as the secretion of HBe−25, HBe−39, and PCLZ was not adversely affected by the inhibitor. Thus, our findings are consistent with the idea that a cellular protein increases specifically HBe secretion and that the activity of this protein (TSP) depends upon theN-glycosylation status of the cell. The molecular mechanism by which TSP increases HBe secretion remains to be determined, although we demonstrate that the tunicamycin sensitivity of secretion absolutely requires a part of the P22 C-terminal domain, a region absent in mature HBe. First, P22 truncations larger than 18 amino acids abolished tunicamycin sensitivity, suggesting that the sequence upstream of position −18 is important for the interaction with TSP. Second, the 39 C-terminal amino acids of P22 conferred tunicamycin sensitivity on PCLZEC39. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a sequence located between amino acids −19 and −39 is involved in the interaction with TSP. However, since in PCLZEC39 both the N- and C-terminal domains of P22 are present, we cannot exclude the possibility that the P22 N terminus may also be involved in this interaction, a possibility not supported by reports on the native structure of HBe (7Schlicht H.-J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3489-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Schödel F. Peterson D. Zheng J. Jones J.E. Hughes J.L. Milich D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1332-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase (22Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.-J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). How might tunicamycin affect the activity of TSP? The simplest explanation is that TSP is only active when N-glycosylated. Another possibility is that its activity is indirectly affected by tunicamycin. TSP would require the involvement of aN-glycoprotein for its correct folding, processing, subcellular localization, or activity. The next question is how does such a protein function. TSP could be a chaperone that favors the folding of P22, increasing the amount of P22 that exits from the ER and is further transported to the cell surface. The first possibility is that the sequence −19 to −39 promotes the binding of TSP in a direct manner. This seems unlikely since it is generally assumed that, to recognize unfolded proteins, chaperones interact with exposed hydrophobic residues, free exposed sulfhydryl groups, or partially glucose-trimmed oligosaccharides (23Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 24Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), features that are not present in the sequence −19 to −39 (see Fig. 1 B). In particular, we can exclude a direct binding of BiP to this sequence as it has been shown that BiP preferentially binds a heptameric consensus motif containing a subset of aromatic and hydrophobic residues in alternating positions (25Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 26Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), a motif not present in the sequence −19 to −39. Similarly, binding of calnexin can also be ruled out, as this chaperone is a lectin that recognizes specifically partially trimmed, monoglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides (27Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 28Herbert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A.

https://openalex.org/W2002386897,"The co-crystal structures of FGF2 and heparin-derived tetra- and hexasaccharides demonstrated the existence of high and low affinity contact residues that are likely to be involved in heparin binding (Faham, S., Hileman, R. E., Fromm, J. R., Linhardt, R. J., and Rees, D. C. (1996)Science 271, 1116–1120). To study the role of these putative contact residues, we chose three fibroblast growth factor family members with distinct heparin affinities for comparative mutagenesis studies. Only one amino acid significantly differed between FGF1 and FGF2 and was mutated, FGF1-31K. FGF7, also called keratinocyte growth factor, was mutated to mimic either FGF1 or FGF2 at two of the putative high contact points termed FGF7-1 and FGF7-2, respectively. FGF2 has higher apparent heparin affinity than FGF1 or FGF7, and FGF1 has higher heparin affinity than FGF7. All three mutants showed an increase in apparent heparin affinity compared with wild types. FGF7-1 has a lower apparent heparin affinity than FGF7-2, analogous to wild type FGF1 and FGF2. The FGF1-31K mutant showed no change in mitogenic activity, whereas the FGF7 mutants exhibited a decrease in activity. These results indicate that the co-crystal structure of the FGF2-heparin complexes can be used to design a rational approach to the generation of mutants with defined affinities for heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The co-crystal structures of FGF2 and heparin-derived tetra- and hexasaccharides demonstrated the existence of high and low affinity contact residues that are likely to be involved in heparin binding (Faham, S., Hileman, R.

FGF1 and FGF2, also commonly referred to as acidic and basic FGF, respectively, are the prototypes of the family and are the most extensively characterized. The FGF family members share a wide variety of overlapping biological activities and receptor binding properties. They are also capable of binding to heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). It has been demonstrated that heparin can potentiate the mitogenic activity of FGF1 (5Mueller S.N. Thomas K.A.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10229-10248Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that 2–10 saccharide units are capable of binding to FGF2, but 8–12 saccharide units are required for receptor dimerization and subsequent activation (13Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11131-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Heparin and HSPGs also have been shown to bind and internalize FGF2 (15Roghani M. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22156-22162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rusnati M. Urbinati C. Presta M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Heparin and HSPGs are negatively charged polymers (13Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M. Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Waksman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16382-16389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and are thought to interact with protein molecules primarily via electrostatic interactions. However other factors such as amino acid composition, positioning, and conformation are likely to contribute to the specificity of heparin-protein interactions. Margalit et al.(17Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employed computer modeling and sequences of known heparin-binding proteins to determine the spatial distribution that may affect heparin binding. From their analysis of full-length human FGF1, basic amino acids corresponding to positions 126 and 133 were determined to be key residues for heparin binding. However, residue 133 is not conserved in different species of FGF1. In bovine and chicken, this residue is a leucine, and these proteins exhibit heparin affinities that are similar to that of human FGF1 (18Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Winkles J.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It also has been suggested that the heparin binding domain on proteins can be defined through linear consensus sequences (19Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Google Scholar). The proposed motifs of XBBXBX or XBBBXXBX, where B designates a basic residue and X a hydropathic amino acid, corresponds well with three regions in the primary sequence of FGF1. These regions include residues 22–27, 113–120, and 124–131. We recently examined the role of basic residues in these regions in FGF1-heparin interactions by site-directed mutagenesis of the basic amino acids to glycine residues (20Wong P. Hampton B. Szylobryt E. Gallagher A.M. Jaye M. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25805-25811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mutations of basic residues between 22–27 generated no effect, but mutations within residues 113–120 did result in a slight decrease in apparent heparin affinity. The most dramatic decrease within these regions was seen at position 127. However when lysine 132, which is located just outside of the putative consensus sequence, is mutated, the apparent heparin affinity of FGF1 is reduced significantly (6Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The importance of residues 127 and 132 in heparin binding is supported by the co-crystal structure of FGF2 and heparin-derived tetra- and hexasaccharides. Faham et al. (21Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) identified high and low affinity contact residues on FGF2 that are involved in heparin binding. A protein sequence alignment between these contact residues of FGF2 and the FGF family members identified residues in FGF1 corresponding to amino acids 127 and 132 as putative high affinity contact sites. In this alignment, the two residues predicted by computer modeling to be involved in heparin binding did not correlate with either high or low affinity contact points. Consistent with the co-crystal structure, when we mutated these residues identified by molecular modeling, there was little effect on heparin binding (20Wong P. Hampton B. Szylobryt E. Gallagher A.M. Jaye M. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25805-25811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). From this sequence alignment, there were no residues that were entirely conserved throughout the FGF family, yet all members are capable of binding heparin. We chose three members from the FGF family, each with a distinct heparin affinity, to study the role of these contact residues in heparin binding. FGF2 has higher apparent heparin affinity than FGF1 and FGF7, which is also known as keratinocyte growth factor. FGF7 has lower apparent heparin affinity than FGF1. We examined the effect on heparin affinity when these putative contact points are mutated to resemble other FGF family members. The results are consistent with the co-crystal structure of heparin-derived tetra- and hexasaccharides and FGF2 and suggest that a rational approach to generating mutants with designed heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan affinities is possible.

Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Wild type and mutant plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain HB101 cells, and plasmid DNA was isolated. The DNA plasmids were digested with NdeI andHindIII and subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. A 920-base pair band was excised from the gel, purified by Wizard DNA Clean-up System (Promega, Madison, WI), and subcloned into theNdeI and HindIII sites of the pET3c expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) as described previously (24Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). Positive ligations were transformed into BL21(DES) pLysS cells. The FGF7 DNA fragment was amplified from human fibroblast cDNA using the polymerase chain reaction technique (25Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar).NcoI and BamHI restriction site were introduced into the 5′ and 3′ of the DNA fragment using the following primers: (sense) 5′-CTA GTG GGT ACT ATA TCC ATG GCT TGC AAT GAC ATG ACT CC-3′ and (antisense) 5′-GGG TTC TTT ATA TAC CGG ATC CAA TTA AGT TAT TGC-3′, respectively. Samples were subjected to 35 cycles of amplification using a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermocycler. Each cycle included denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 58 °C for 40 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 40 s. The resulting fragment was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, excised from the gel, and electro-eluted as described previously (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). The FGF7 fragment was cloned using the pCR-Script SK(+) cloning kit (Stratagene). The FGF7 mutants were generated as described above for FGF1 using the following primers: FGF7-1, 5′-GCC TTA AAT AAA AAG GGG ATT CCT AAA AGA GG-3′; and FGF7-2, 5′-GCC TTA AAT CGA AAG GGG ATT CCT AAA AGA GG-3′. The FGF7s were subcloned into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) expression vector as described previously (24Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of E. coli strain BL21(DES) pLysS cells containing recombinant plasmids were diluted into 1-liter cultures of Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillan and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and allowed to grow to an absorbance of 0.3 at 600 nm. Isopropylthiol β-galactosidase was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until further use. Cell pellets from 1-liter cultures were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mmTris and 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, then sonicated at maximum intensity for 30 s using the large probe of a Heat System 380 sonicator. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were diluted to 100 mls with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (buffer A), and applied to a 5-ml Bio-Rad heparin cartridge using a Waters Associates HPLC system. Samples were eluted with a linear gradient of buffer A and buffer A containing 2.0m NaCl. Flow was 1.5 ml/min, and 1 min fractions were collected. Aliquots of fractions eluted from the heparin cartridge were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). A 15% acrylamide and 0.4% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide solution was polymerized in a Hoefer Mini-gel apparatus, and electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V. Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose in 25 mm Tris, 0.2 m glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.02% SDS for 30 min at 50 V, and an additional 60 min at 100 V. FGF1- and FGF7-containing fractions were identified by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal FGF1-specific antibody or FGF7 C-terminal-specific antibody, respectively, and125I-protein A as described previously (27Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). FGF2 and FGF2 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Dan Rifkin (Department of Cell Biology, New York University Medical Center). FGF7 and FGF7 antibody were kindly provided by Drs. Don Bottaro and Jeff Rubin (Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute). Balb MK cells were grown in 96-well plates at 37 °C to ∼80% confluency in low calcium Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. The cells were serum-starved in a 1:1 mix of Ham's F-12 and Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 5 μg/ml transferrin and 30 nm selenium for 72 h. Selenium and transferrin are trace elements found in serum whose presence is required for cells to respond to the addition of growth factors after being starved (28Kimball E.S. Fisher M.C. Persico F.J. Cell Immunol. 1988; 113: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Starve media was changed before the addition of growth factors. After 18 h, the cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml). The cells were harvested 4 h later using a Filter Mate Cell Harvester (Packard Instrument Co., Inc.) onto a glass fiber filter (Packard Instrument Co., Inc.), and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was measured using a Matrix 9600 Direct beta counter for 3 min. Specific residues in FGF1 have been identified previously to have a substantial impact on its apparent heparin affinity (20Wong P. Hampton B. Szylobryt E. Gallagher A.M. Jaye M. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25805-25811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Harper J.W. Lobb R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, the co-crystallization between FGF2 and heparin-derived tetra- and hexasaccharides identified residues involved in high and low affinity binding to heparin (21Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). These high and low affinity residues, when compared with additional FGF members in a protein sequence alignment as shown in Table I, support other work identifying putative heparin binding residues in FGF1 (27Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Harper J.W. Lobb R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). FGF2 has higher apparent heparin affinity than FGF1, and from Table I, only one residue was significantly different between the two proteins. Using site-directed mutagenesis, FGF1 was mutated at residue number 31 from serine to lysine. FGF7, which has lower apparent heparin affinity than either FGF1 or FGF2, varied the most in the high affinity contact points between FGF1 and FGF2. Mutants of FGF7 were generated to mimic either FGF1 or FGF2 by altering the high affinity positions glutamine 127 to lysine or arginine, respectively, and valine 132 to lysine, which is common to both FGF1 and FGF2. These mutants were termed FGF7-1 and FGF7-2, respectively.Table IHigh and low affinity contact residues of FGF2 and corresponding residues of other FGF family membersFGF family memberResidue number3132109127132141142FGF-1SerAsnAsnLysLysGlnLysFGF-2LysAsnAsnArgLysGlnLysFGF-7ArgThrAsnGlnValGlnLysAffinityLowHighLowHighHighHighLowHigh affinity contact residues are defined by the co-crystallization of heparin-derived tetrasaccharide interactions with FGF2.

Low affinity sites are defined as the additional contact sites when using heparin-derived hexasaccharides. FGF1 is the reference sequence where 1 is the first residue after the initiator methionine. FGF family sequence alignment was done using the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis package. The FGF1 DNA coding sequence was originally cloned into the pUC9 vector with EcoRI (30Jaye M. Howk R. Burgess W.H. Ricca G.A. Chiu I.-M. Ravera M.W. O'Brien S.J. Modi W.S. Maciag T. Drohan W.N. Science. 1986; 233: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The insert was digested withEcoRI and HindIII, which removed a large portion of the 3′-untranslated region and was subcloned into pBluescript SK+. Single-stranded DNA was generated (22Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar), and an NdeI site was introduced as the initiator methionine for subcloning into the pET3c expression vector (Fig. 1). Mutant FGF1-31K was generated from the wild type FGF1 sequence containing theNdeI restriction site in pBluescript SK+ and subcloned into pET3c as shown in Fig. 2 (22Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). The FGF1 proteins were expressed in BL21(DES) pLysS cells. FGF7 is a secreted protein with a classical signal sequence (31Aaronson S.A. Bottaro D.P. Miki T. Ron D. Finch P.W. Fleming T.P. Ahn J. Taylor W.G. Rubin J.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 638: 62-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To obtain the mature form of the secreted protein, the 5′ primer was designed with anNcoI site as the initiator methionine as described previously in Ron et al. (32Ron D. Bottaro D.P. Finch P.W. Morris D. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2984-2988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FGF7 DNA sequence was obtained from human fibroblast cDNA using the polymerase chain reaction method (25Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the pCR-Script SK+ vector. The NcoI site and aBamHI site at the 3′-untranslated region were used to subclone FGF7 into pET15b (Fig. 1). FGF7-1 and FGF7-2 mutants were generated to have the putative heparin contact residues corresponding to FGF1 or FGF2, respectively (Fig. 2). These proteins were expressed in BL21(DES) pLysS cells.Figure 2FGF1 and FGF7 wild type and mutant sequences. The full-length amino acid sequence of human FGF1 and the amino acid sequence of the secreted form of FGF7 are shown. The amino acids that have been mutated by site-directed mutagenesis are indicated. The boxed residues are those previously mutated by site-directed mutagenesis (20Wong P. Hampton B. Szylobryt E. Gallagher A.M. Jaye M. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25805-25811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues are identified using the single letter code and numbered as referenced by wild type FGF1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All members of the FGF family are capable of binding to heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, but their relative affinities vary. From a protein sequence alignment, a comparison shows that none of the putative contact points are conserved throughout the family (21Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). This indicates that the differences in heparin affinities between family members may result from differences in the individual contributions of these amino acids to heparin binding. The heparin affinities of wild type and mutant FGF proteins were assayed by the concentration of NaCl required to elute the proteins from immobilized heparin. There is only one amino acid of these putative contact residues, amino acid Lys-31, that differs substantially between FGF1 and FGF2, yet FGF2 has significantly higher apparent affinity for heparin. Recombinant wild type FGF2 eluted from immobilized heparin at 1.23 mNaCl (Fig. 3). The FGF1 site-directed mutant was generated to contain a lysine at position 31, as in FGF2, rather than a serine residue. To avoid pre-selecting high or low affinity heparin binding FGFs, clarified E. coli lysates were applied to immobilized heparin. Western blot analysis performed on fractions of FGF1 collected from immobilized heparin showed that wild type FGF1 eluted in the range of 0.92 to 1.10 m NaCl. The FGF1-31K mutant showed an increase in apparent heparin affinity with an elution range between 0.98 to 1.22 m NaCl (Fig. 3). FGF7 exhibits two putative high affinity contact residues dramatically differing from the rest of the FGF family members. These were at positions 127 and 132. The FGF7 mutants were designed to mimic the putative heparin contact residues in FGF1 and FGF2. Western blot analysis of fractions collected from immobilized heparin showed that wild type FGF7 was eluted from the column in the range of 0.64–0.84m NaCl (Fig. 4). The FGF7-1 and FGF7-2 mutants exhibited increased apparent heparin affinity. FGF7-1 eluted in the range of 0.80–0.98 m NaCl and FGF7-2, between 0.92 and 1.10 m NaCl. Analogous to wild type FGF1 and FGF2 apparent heparin affinities, the FGF7-1 mutant had lower apparent heparin affinity than the FGF7-2 mutant (Fig. 4). It has been shown previously that diminishing heparin affinity can alter mitogenic activity. An FGF1 mutant, where a glutamic acid is substituted for a lysine at residue 132, has reduced heparin affinity but is still able to bind to receptor and stimulate the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun, similar to wild type. However [3H]thymidine incorporation is greatly reduced, suggesting that relatively high affinity heparin binding is required for completion of the mitogenic signal of FGF1 (6Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine whether these mutants also have altered capacity to stimulate mitogenesis, DNA synthesis assays were performed on Balb MK cells. The FGF1-31K mutant showed no altered capacity to stimulate DNA synthesis compared with wild type. For both, the half maximum was at 1 ng/ml, and maximum stimulation occurred at 10 ng/ml (Fig. 5). There is a decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation at high concentrations of both wild type and mutant FGF1 that may be due to high FGF receptor occupancy that does not allow for FGF receptor activation. It is also possible that FGF1 at this concentration is acting in another function that is not detected by [3H]thymidine incorporation. FGF7 activity is restricted to cells expressing a splice variant of FGFR-2 (33Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Finch P.W. Florio C. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12767-12770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L. Burgess W.H. Chan A.M.L. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be inhibited by the presence of heparin (32Ron D. Bottaro D.P. Finch P.W. Morris D. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2984-2988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Strain A.J. McGuinness G. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mitogenic assays were performed in the absence of heparin to allow for maximum activity. The results show that both FGF7-1 and FGF7-2 mutants are slightly less active than wild type. When compared with each other, FGF7-1 is slightly more active than FGF7-2. Previous work identifying regions involved in heparin binding of FGF1 demonstrated the importance of residue 132 (6Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Harper J.W. Lobb R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of this residue from a lysine to a glutamic acid showed this mutant to have reduced affinity toward immobilized heparin and to be a poor mitogen (6Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However it was able to bind its high affinity receptors and induce the immediate early genes c-fosand c-jun similar to wild type FGF1 (27Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This demonstrates a dissociation between activation of immediate early events and heparin binding of FGF1. The heparin binding domain on FGF1 has been suggested to be defined by a linear consensus sequence of basic and hydropathic amino acids by Cardin and Weintraub (19Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Google Scholar). We previously examined the role of these basic residues identified by the consensus sequences for their impact on heparin binding. There are three regions in FGF1 that fit well with the XBBXBX or XBBBXXBX motifs and they are residues 22–27, 113–120, and 124–131. Residue 132 lies immediately outside any of these consensus motifs. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the boxed basic residues in Fig. 2 were changed to glycine. Mutations in region 22–27 and 113–120 had little to no impact on affinity for immobilized heparin. Residue 127 within region 3 had a significant effect on apparent heparin affinity, although the adjacent residue, mutant 126 had a modest effect (20Wong P. Hampton B. Szylobryt E. Gallagher A.M. Jaye M. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25805-25811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Other site-directed mutants have been generated where basic residues replaced nonbasic residues between amino acids 124 and 131. None of these mutants had increased heparin affinity but retained affinities similar to wild type. 2P. Wong and W. H. Burgess, unpublished results. These results indicate that these residues are not involved in heparin binding and that an increase in the number of basic residues on the protein surface is not sufficient in affecting apparent heparin affinity. The co-crystal structure between FGF2 and heparin-derived tetra- and hexasaccharides identified residues that are involved in high and low affinity binding. These amino acids do not form linear sequences but are interspersed throughout the protein. When these basic amino acids are aligned with other FGF family members, the occupancy of these positions with basic residues seems to correlate with increased heparin affinity, although none had been tested (21Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Previous work identified positions 127 and 132 as having significant impact on FGF1 heparin affinity (20Wong P. Hampton B. Szylobryt E. Gallagher A.M. Jaye M. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25805-25811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Harper J.W. Lobb R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and, interestingly, the protein sequence alignment of high and low affinity contact sites identified these two positions as two high affinity positions. FGF7 varied the most at these two positions. To determine whether these contact points are involved in heparin affinity in other FGF family members and whether heparin affinity can be altered in a predictable way based solely on the occupancy of these contact residues, we chose three FGF family members to study, each with a distinct heparin affinity. The putative contact residues for FGF1, FGF2, and FGF7, shown in Table I, suggest that basic residues at specific positions are involved in high affinity binding to heparin. FGF2 has higher apparent heparin affinity than FGF1. The only substantial difference between FGF1 and FGF2 is amino acid 31. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we modified this putative low affinity site on FGF1 to mimic FGF2, serine 31 to lysine. The results show the FGF1-31K mutant has an increased apparent heparin affinity compared with wild type. The other mutants showed similar results. FGF7 has the lowest apparent heparin affinity between FGF1 and FGF2. Two high affinity mutations, amino acids 127 and 132, were constructed to correspond to the FGF1 and FGF2 contact points. Both FGF7-1 and FGF7-2 mutants exhibited increased apparent affinity for immobilized heparin, and the relative affinities were analogous to wild type FGF1 and FGF2 affinities. The results indicate that amino acids 127 and 132 in FGF2 and FGF7 are involved in heparin binding. The difference in increased apparent heparin affinity between FGF7-1 and FGF7-2 may be due to the type of basic residue substitution. Fromm et al. (37Fromm J.R. Hileman R.E. Caldwell E.E. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a seven-residue arginine peptide had higher affinity than a seven-residue lysine peptide for immobilized heparin. These results indicate that the properties of the amino acid involved in heparin binding also is important in defining heparin affinity. FGF1 and FGF2 consists of 12 antiparallel β-sheets (36Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar); however, the crystal structure of other FGF family members have not been solved. These results indicate that there may be a generality to the co-crystal structure of FGF2 and heparin-derived saccharides that extends to other members of the family. The biological activities of these mutants, as measured by stimulation of DNA synthesis, show that they can be altered through their heparin binding properties. As previously shown, a FGF1–132E mutant that had decreased heparin affinity was able to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation and activate immediate early genes. However, this mutant was unable to complete the mitogenic signal, indicating a role for heparin in FGF1 activity. Exogenously added heparin inhibits the mitogenic response of FGF7 (32Ron D. Bottaro D.P. Finch P.W. Morris D. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2984-2988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the diminished mitogenic activity of these FGF7 mutants may be a result of increased affinity for cell surface HSPGs. These two contrasting effects of heparin in the mitogenic activity of FGF may be another mechanism by which FGF activity is regulated. These results also demonstrate that it is possible that FGF mutants can be generated and targeted to specific areas as agonists or antagonists by modifying their heparin binding properties. Together, these results and the results of previous studies indicate that for the FGF family, a heparin binding domain does not consist of a linear sequence of amino acids and cannot be defined by a consensus sequence. The co-crystal structures of FGF2 and tetra- and hexasaccharides identified key residues that generate high and low affinity contact points. In the linear protein sequence, these residues are interspersed, and once folded to form a tertiary structure, generate a high affinity heparin-binding protein. Previously, we and others identified a short peptide from FGF1 with relatively high heparin affinity, but its heparin affinity was less than the full-length protein (20Wong P. Hampton B. Szylobryt E. Gallagher A.M. Jaye M. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25805-25811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Fromm J.R. Hileman R.E. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results further support that heparin affinity of a full-length protein is derived by the amino acids on the surface of a folded protein. The results support the co-crystal structure of heparin derived tetra- and hexasaccharides with FGF2 as a structure consistent with solution studies. The data also demonstrate that the co-crystal structure of the FGF2-heparin complexes can be used to design a rational approach to generate mutants of other FGF family members with defined heparin and HSPGs affinities.

https://openalex.org/W2002262931,"The plasma membrane H+-ATPase of yeast assumes distinct conformational states during its catalytic cycle. To better understand structural changes in the LOOP1 domain, a catalytically important cytoplasmic loop segment linking transmembrane segments 2 and 3, surface epitopes were examined at different stages of catalysis. A polyclonal rabbit antibody was prepared to a fusion protein consisting of LOOP1 and the maltose binding protein. This antibody was affinity-purified to produce a LOOP1-specific fraction that could be used in competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to assess surface exposure of the LOOP1 epitopes. It was found that in an E1 conformation stabilized with either adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) or ADP, less than 10% of the LOOP1 epitopes were accessible on native enzyme. However, when the enzyme was stabilized in an E2-state with ATP plus vanadate, approximately 40% of the surface epitopes on LOOP1 became accessible to antibody. The remaining 60% of the LOOP1 epitopes were fully occluded in the native enzyme and never showed surface exposure. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays utilizing fusion proteins consisting of LOOP1 subdomains demonstrated that all of the available epitopes were contained in the β-strand region (Glu-195—Val-267) of LOOP1. The epitopes that were differentially exposed during catalysis were included in regions upstream and downstream of the highly conserved TGES sequence. Our results suggest that during catalysis either the β-strand region of LOOP1 or an interacting domain undergoes substantial structural rearrangement that facilitates epitope exposure."
