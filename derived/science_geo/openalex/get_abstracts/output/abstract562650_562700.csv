Here, we report that maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) induces a shift in microbial ecology that negatively impacts offspring social behavior. Social deficits and gut microbiota dysbiosis in MHFD offspring are prevented by co-housing with offspring of mothers on a regular diet (MRD) and transferable to germ-free mice. In addition, social interaction induces synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of MRD, but not MHFD offspring. Moreover, MHFD offspring had fewer oxytocin immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus. Using metagenomics and precision microbiota reconstitution, we identified a single commensal strain that corrects oxytocin levels, LTP, and social deficits in MHFD offspring. Our findings causally link maternal diet, gut microbial imbalance, VTA plasticity, and behavior and suggest that probiotic treatment may relieve specific behavioral abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJlYjgwYmY1NGMxZDUyNWE2YTFmMjQ5NDJmZjhhYmJmNiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NzMwNDI2fQ.ozlZ7LZ2i1Hg-hcCl0zPc5KKCjO-qK0ZdEanCWkRM-XefAG8I3G52UW9_A36UaqpQYgi36qpXn4QB2DpnZBZgTu8B-uYQ-HhuTk-Ul1eDog-q2IMc3YpmXLiZt3s8JvKytW3pdE0lrSt8xMiuLdKKq61BMDbGhWjL8AOIf-7awiuOyDWRdycUw8qO9h1P3GEYLSGXxxt3lYYN0xxSHk3WfaSyN-3-XGmP94bprxfWNAUzN8ihU16o6hkNbQGILmtP9KURQJYo_Vdk5S0HTNuKZj8o4YEYDWRqmc6yMB3L7V6s4lv3i41UfdOcWpWhpubcAp6vykd66dgRcN8FREqdw(mp4, (17.27 MB) Download video Maternal obesity during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in offspring.

Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to maternal obesity in utero increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children (Connolly et al., 2016Connolly N. Anixt J. Manning P. Ping-I Lin D. Marsolo K.A. Bowers K.

Given the increase in the prevalence of obesity (Skinner and Skelton, 2014Skinner A.C. Skelton J.A. Prevalence and trends in obesity and severe obesity among children in the United States, 1999-2012.JAMA pediatrics. 2014; 168: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the neurobiological mechanism by which maternal obesity affects offspring behavior and brain function. The amount and type of dietary macronutrients strongly influence the intestinal microbiota (Tremaroli and Bäckhed, 2012Tremaroli V. Bäckhed F. Functional interactions between the gut microbiota and host metabolism.Nature. 2012; 489: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar), which consists of a vast bacterial community that resides in the lower gut and lives in a symbiotic relationship with the host. Maternal obesity has been associated with alterations in the gut microbiome in offspring in both human and non-human primates (Galley et al., 2014Galley J.D. Bailey M. Kamp Dush C.

Maternal obesity is associated with alterations in the gut microbiome in toddlers.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e113026Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, Ma et al., 2014Ma J. Prince A.L. Bader D.

In addition, some individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD, co-present with gastrointestinal problems and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota (Bresnahan et al., 2015Bresnahan M. Hornig M. Schultz A.F. Gunnes N. Hirtz D. Lie K.K. Magnus P. Reichborn-Kjennerud T. Roth C.

Given the large body of preclinical literature supporting the notion that a bidirectional communication system between the gut and the brain—known as the gut-brain axis—links gut and brain activities (Cryan and Dinan, 2012Cryan J.F.

Invest. 2015; 125: 926-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), it has been speculated that changes in the gut microbiome may be relevant to the development of behavioral symptoms associated with ASD (Hsiao et al., 2013Hsiao E.Y. McBride S.W. Hsien S. Sharon G. Hyde E.R. McCue T. Codelli J.A. Chow J. Reisman S.E.

Padua D. Tillisch K. Altered brain-gut axis in autism: comorbidity or causative mechanisms?.BioEssays. 2014; 36: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, how changes in bacteria that inhabit the intestine could influence brain development and function remains unknown. Here we report that maternal high-fat diet (MHFD)-induced obesity in mice is associated with social behavioral deficits, which are mediated by alterations in the offspring gut microbiome. Notably, we also found that MHFD-induced changes in the offspring gut microbiota block long-lasting neural adaptation in the mesolimbic dopamine reward system (ventral tegmental area [VTA]). Moreover, oral treatment with a single commensal bacterial species corrects oxytocin levels and synaptic dysfunction in the VTA and selectively reverses social deficits in MHFD offspring. To investigate how maternal diet-induced obesity affects offspring neurodevelopment, female mice were fed either regular diet (RD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, a standard period required to reach a state of diet-induced obesity in mice (Aye et al., 2015Aye I.L. Rosario F.J. Powell T.L. Jansson T. Adiponectin supplementation in pregnant mice prevents the adverse effects of maternal obesity on placental function and fetal growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 12858-12863Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Females were then paired with males to produce offspring that were given regular diet after weaning (Figure 1A). As expected, MHFD significantly increased maternal weight (Figures S1A–S1C). Consistent with reports of more frequent spontaneous abortion in obese mothers (King, 2006King J.C. Maternal obesity, metabolism, and pregnancy outcomes.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2006; 26: 271-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), the litter size was reduced (Figure S1D) and latency to first litter increased in female mice fed HFD (Figure S1E). It is noteworthy that there was no significant difference in offspring weight between maternal diet cohorts at 7–12 weeks of age (Figures S1F and S1G), the time at which behavioral and electrophysiological experiments were performed.Figure S1High-Fat Diet Increases Weight of Mothers and Impairs Offspring Social Behavior, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–B) Female mice fed a HFD showed a > 25% increase in weight compared to regular diet (RD)-fed females after 8 weeks on diet (A, p < 0.05, t = 2.42; B, p < 0.01, t = 3.90).(C) HFD-fed females showed increased fat mass relative to RD dams (C, p < 0.0001, t = 5.80).(D and E) Compared to RD-, HFD-fed female litter size was decreased (D, p < 0.01, t = 3.18) and time to first litter increased (E, p < 0.05, t = 2.26).(F and G) Offspring weight did not differ between maternal diet cohorts at either 7–8 (F, p = 0.12, t = 1.63) or 11–12 weeks of age (G, p = 0.10, t = 1.80), the age range during which all behavioral tests were performed.(H and I) MHFD offspring showed reduced contact number (H, p < 0.001, t = 5.10) and frequency (I, p < 0.01, t = 4.73) in the reciprocal social interaction test.(J and K) In the three-chamber test, MHFD mice show impaired sociability (J, MRD p < 0.01, t = 3.67, MHFD p = 0.15, t = 1.81; Maternal diet effect F1,52 = 15.00, p < 0.001) and preference for social novelty (K, MRD p < 0.001, t = 4.28, MHFD p = 0.053, t = 2.29; Maternal diet effect F1,52 = 21.53, p < 0.0001).

Hoffman E.P. Genomics, intellectual disability, and autism.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we studied social behavior in maternal regular diet (MRD) and MHFD offspring. First, we assessed reciprocal social interactions by recording the amount of time a pair of mice, unfamiliar with each other, spent interacting in a neutral arena (Figure 1B). When compared to MRD offspring, MHFD offspring had fewer reciprocal interactions (Figures 1C and 1D, S1H, and S1I). Next, we used the three-chamber test (Silverman et al., 2010Silverman J.L. Yang M. Lord C. Crawley J.N. Behavioural phenotyping assays for mouse models of autism.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) to assess (1) sociability by comparing the time mice spent interacting with an empty wire cage versus one containing a mouse and (2) preference for social novelty by measuring the time mice spent interacting with a familiar versus a stranger mouse (Figure 1E). Consistent with the results from reciprocal social interactions, MHFD offspring had impaired sociability and showed no preference for social novelty (Figures 1F–1I, S1J, and S1K). Taken together these data indicate that MHFD offspring display social deficits. A variety of factors could contribute to the etiology of MHFD-induced social behavioral abnormalities. However, maternal obesity has been shown to alter the gut microbiome of offspring (Galley et al., 2014Galley J.D. Bailey M. Kamp Dush C. Schoppe-Sullivan S. Christian L.M. Maternal obesity is associated with alterations in the gut microbiome in toddlers.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e113026Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, Ma et al., 2014Ma J. Prince A.L. Bader D.

Commun. 2014; 5: 3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and individuals diagnosed with ASD can co-present dysbiosis of the gut microbiota (Bresnahan et al., 2015Bresnahan M. Hornig M. Schultz A.F. Gunnes N. Hirtz D. Lie K.K. Magnus P. Reichborn-Kjennerud T. Roth C.

Microbiol. 2005; 54: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). To examine whether MHFD induces alterations in offspring gut microbiota, we analyzed the bacterial composition and community structure in the feces of MRD and MHFD offspring by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. The microbial communities in both MRD and MHFD offspring were comprised of a typical mouse gut microbiota, dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (Figures S2A–S2D). While bacterial diversity computed based on weighted UniFrac distances (the assessment of community structure by considering abundance of operational taxonomic units [OTUs]) did not differ significantly between the offspring from either diet group (Figure S2E), unweighted analyses of UniFrac distances (assessment of community structure by considering only OTU presence/absence) revealed a marked difference between the structures of the bacterial communities (Figure 1J). Moreover, the diversity of microbiota in MHFD offspring was reduced compared to MRD microbiota (Figure S2F). Consistent with previous reports (Turnbaugh et al., 2006Turnbaugh P.J. Ley R.E. Mahowald M.A. Magrini V. Mardis E.R. Gordon J.I. An obesity-associated gut microbiome with increased capacity for energy harvest.Nature. 2006; 444: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (8182) Google Scholar), an HFD regimen in mothers induced a remarkable change in the maternal microbiome composition and diversity (Figures S2G and S2H), which was similar to that observed in their offspring (Figures 1J and S2F). While microbial communities vary across individuals (Yatsunenko et al., 2012Yatsunenko T. Rey F.E. Manary M.J. Trehan I. Dominguez-Bello M.G. Contreras M. Magris M. Hidalgo G. Baldassano R.N. Anokhin A.P. et al.Human gut microbiome viewed across age and geography.Nature. 2012; 486: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (4787) Google Scholar), co-housed family members are known to share their microbiota (Song et al., 2013Song S.J. Lauber C. Costello E.K. Lozupone C.A. Humphrey G. Berg-Lyons D. Caporaso J.G. Knights D. Clemente J.C. Nakielny S. et al.Cohabiting family members share microbiota with one another and with their dogs.eLife. 2013; 2: e00458Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since mice are coprophagic and transfer gut microbiota between each other by the fecal-oral route (Ridaura et al., 2013Ridaura V.K. Faith J.J. Rey F.E. Cheng J. Duncan A.E. Kau A.L. Griffin N.W. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Bain J.R. et al.Gut microbiota from twins discordant for obesity modulate metabolism in mice.Science. 2013; 341: 1241214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar), we examined whether co-housing MHFD with MRD mice prevents the social deficits in MHFD offspring. To this end, at weaning (3 weeks) an MHFD mouse was co-housed with three MRD mice (Figures 2A and 2B ). Control groups consisted of individual cages containing either four MHFD mice or four MRD mice (Figure 2B). Fecal samples were collected and social behavior in MRD and MHFD offspring was assessed when mice were 7–8 weeks old. Strikingly, MHFD mice co-housed with MRD mice exhibited normal reciprocal social interactions (Figures 2C and 2D and S3A–S3C ), as well as normal sociability and preference for social novelty, as determined by the 3-chamber test (Figures 2E, 2F, S3D and S3E). Thus, co-housing with control mice corrects social deficits in MHFD offspring.Figure S3Co-housing MHFD with MRD Offspring Reversed MHFD Offspring Social Deficits, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) 3MRD:1MHFD offspring co-housing cage composition schematic.(B and C) Co-housing with MRD offspring improved MHFD offspring reciprocal social interaction contact number (B, MRD versus MHFD p < 0.01, t = 5.92; MRD versus Co-housed MHFD p = 0.32, t = 2.27; MHFD versus Co-housed MHFD p < 0.05, t = 3.65; F3,8 = 12.10, p < 0.01) and frequency of interaction (C, MRD versus MHFD p < 0.01, t = 5.89; MRD versus Co-housed MHFD p = 0.32, t = 2.26; MHFD versus Co-housed MHFD p < 0.05, t = 3.63; F3,8 = 11.99, p < 0.01).(D and E) Co-housing with MRD improved MHFD offspring sociability (C, MRD p < 0.01, t = 3.97; Co-housed MRD p < 0.01, t = 3.53; MHFD p = 0.79, t = 1.31; Co-housed MHFD p = 0.086, t = 2.42; Maternal diet/Housing effect F1,32 = 13.42, p < 0.001) and preference social novelty (D, MRD p < 0.01, t = 3.66; Co-housed MRD p < 0.05, t = 2.91; MHFD p = 0.67, t = 1.41; Co-housed MHFD p < 0.01, t = 3.83; Maternal diet/Housing effect F1,32 = 47.73, p < 0.0001).(F) Schematic of the co-housing experiment.(G) 1MRD:3MHFD offspring co-housing cage composition schematic.(H–K) Social interaction time (H, MRD versus MHFD p < 0.0001, t = 10.21; MRD versus co-housed MHFD p > 0.99, t = 1.41; MHFD versus co-housed MHFD p < 0.0001, t = 8.53; p < 0.0001, F3,8 = 38.88) and contact duration (I, MRD versus MHFD p < 0.0001, t = 7.18; MRD versus co-housed MHFD p > 0.99, t = 0.59; MHFD versus co-housed MHFD p < 0.001, t = 6.29; p = 0.0001, F3,8 = 19.14) in the reciprocal interaction test; sociability (J, MRD p < 0.0001, t = 7.37; MHFD p = 0.802, t = 1.31; Co-housed MRD p < 0.0001, t = 6.02; Co-housed MHFD p < 0.0001, t = 9.46; Maternal diet/ Housing/Interaction effect F3,32 = 18.62, p < 0.0001) and preference for social novelty (K, MRD p < 0.05, t = 2.82; MHFD p = 0.723, t = 1.37; Co-housed MRD p < 0.05, t = 2.72; Co-housed MHFD p < 0.01, t = 3.34; Maternal diet/Housing/Interaction effect F3,32 = 4.55, p < 0.01) as well as UniFrac phylogenetic clustering (L, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.681; n = 1,000 rarefactions; 12,600 reads/sample), are all restored in MHFD offspring co-housed with MRD mice in a 3 MHFD:1MRD configuration.

Indeed, co-housing caused a shift in the bacterial phylogenetic profile of MHFD mice to resemble that of MRD or MRD co-housed mice (Figure 2G), thus correcting the MHFD-induced alterations in the commensal microbiota. In agreement with the idea that the fecal microbiota of MHFD offspring lacks one or more beneficial bacterial species required for normal social behavior, co-housing one MRD with three MHFD offspring was sufficient to rescue both the social behaviors and microbiota phylogenetic profile of MHFD offspring (Figures S3F–S3L). Studies on germ-free (GF) mice have shown that the intestinal microbiota can influence brain development and function (Cryan and Dinan, 2012Cryan J.F. Dinan T.G. Mind-altering microorganisms: the impact of the gut microbiota on brain and behaviour.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 701-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that, if the lack of one or more bacterial species in the microbiota of MHFD offspring is responsible for their defective social behavior, GF mice should also be socially deficient. Confirming this hypothesis and in keeping with recent results (Desbonnet et al., 2014Desbonnet L. Clarke G. Shanahan F. Dinan T.G. Cryan J.F. Microbiota is essential for social development in the mouse.Mol. Psychiatry. 2014; 19: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), social behaviors were impaired in GF mice (Figures 3A–3D and S4A–S4D ).Figure S4Social Deficits of Germ Free (GF) Mice Are Rescued by Fecal Microbiota Transplant from MRD, but Not MHFD, Donors at 4 Weeks of Age, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A and B) During the reciprocal social interaction test, number of contacts (A, p < 0.001, t = 10.10) and frequency of interaction (B, p < 0.001, t = 10.19) were reduced in GF offspring.(C and D) In the three chamber test, GF mice showed impaired sociability (C, Control p < 0.01, t = 3.87; GF p = 0.95, t = 0.73; Group effect F1,24 = 10.58, p < 0.01) and preference for social novelty (D, Control p < 0.05, t = 2.54; GF p > 0.99, t = 0.30; Group effect F1,24 = 2.51, p = 0.13).(E–F) Results from the three-chamber test show fecal microbiota transplant from MRD, but not MHFD offspring at weaning (4 weeks), restored both GF sociability (E, MRD-colonized GF p < 0.01, t = 3.39; MHFD-colonized GF p > 0.99, t = 0.67; Donor/Interaction option effect F1,28 = 8.25, p < 0.01) and preference for social novelty (F, MRD-colonized GF p < 0.05, t = 2.89; MHFD-colonized GF p = 0.69, t = 0.96; Donor effect F1,28 = 7.42, p < 0.05).(G and H) At 8 weeks, neither MRD- nor MHFD- fecal microbiota transplant improved the social deficits in GF mice (G, MRD-colonized GF p = 0.55, t = 1.15; MHFD-colonized GF p = 0.41, t = 1.35; Donor effect F1,12 = 0.020, p = 0.89; H, MRD-colonized GF p = 0.18, t = 1.85; MHFD-colonized GF p > 0.99, t = 0.53; Donor effect F1,12 = 2.85, p = 0.12).

Cell-type-specific regulatory circuits control gene expression in complex, dynamic, and temporally regulated manners (Smale et al., 2013Smale S.T. Plevy S.E. Weinmann A.S. Zhou L. Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Pope S.D. Bhatt D.M. Tong A.J. Toward an understanding of the gene-specific and global logic of inducible gene transcription.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2013; 78: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Understanding these regulatory networks is critical for a better understanding of the biological processes that contribute to human health and disease. The innate immune system represents a first line of defense against microbial infection and relies on dynamic transcriptional changes, initiated when germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (e.g., Toll-like receptors [TLRs]) detect microbial products (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Innate immune recognition.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar, Medzhitov and Horng, 2009Medzhitov R. Horng T. Transcriptional control of the inflammatory response.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 692-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). These receptors trigger signaling cascades that converge on well-defined transcription factors including NF-κB and interferon regulatory factors (e.g., IRF3), which induce transcription of hundreds of immune response genes (IRGs). As sustained expression of IRGs can lead to tissue damage and immune pathology, their expression must be carefully regulated (Chen and Nuñez, 2010Chen G.Y. Nuñez G. Sterile inflammation: sensing and reacting to damage.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 826-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory checkpoints ensure that the magnitude and duration of these events are rigorously controlled and that these pathways are turned off in a timely manner. A large proportion of the human and mouse genome is transcribed as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) (Derrien et al., 2012Derrien T. Johnson R. Bussotti G. Tanzer A. Djebali S. Tilgner H. Guernec G. Martin D. Merkel A. Knowles D.G. et al.The GENCODE v7 catalog of human long noncoding RNAs: analysis of their gene structure, evolution, and expression.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1775-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (3644) Google Scholar, Djebali et al., 2012Djebali S. Davis C.A. Merkel A. Dobin A. Lassmann T. Mortazavi A. Tanzer A. Lagarde J. Lin W. Schlesinger F. et al.Landscape of transcription in human cells.Nature. 2012; 489: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3640) Google Scholar). Among these ncRNAs, microRNAs are well-known regulators of gene expression. In addition, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) also regulate gene expression in diverse biological contexts (Morris and Mattick, 2014Morris K.V. Mattick J.S. The rise of regulatory RNA.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 423-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). To distinguish them from small noncoding RNAs, lncRNAs are arbitrarily defined as having ≥200 nucleotides. These RNAs can be either intergenic (between protein coding genes; long intergenic noncoding RNA [lincRNA]), intronic, natural antisense transcripts (NATs), or transcribed from divergent enhancers and promoters (Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013Ulitsky I. Bartel D.P. lincRNAs: genomics, evolution, and mechanisms.Cell. 2013; 154: 26-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). By binding to chromatin-modifying factors, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), or transcription factors, lncRNAs control gene transcription. Also, lncRNAs act via post-transcriptional mechanisms targeting the splicing, stability, or translation of host mRNAs (Guttman and Rinn, 2012Guttman M. Rinn J.L. Modular regulatory principles of large non-coding RNAs.Nature. 2012; 482: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Although lncRNAs have been identified in virtually all immune cells, their functions in these cells are only beginning to emerge (Atianand and Fitzgerald, 2014Atianand M.K. Fitzgerald K.A.

For example, lincRNA-Cox2 was identified as a dynamically regulated gene induced by TLR ligands and that, in turn, acts to both promote and repress inflammatory gene expression (Carpenter et al., 2013Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B. Henry-Bezy M.

Several additional lncRNAs including THRIL (Li et al., 2014Li Z. Chao T.C. Chang K.Y. Lin N. Patil V.S. Shimizu C. Head S.R. Burns J.C. Rana T.M.

A long noncoding RNA associated with susceptibility to celiac disease.Science. 2016; 352: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and an antisense lncRNA, AS-IL-1α (Chan et al., 2015Chan J.

In T cells, NeST regulates IFN-γ gene transcription and persistent infection with Theiler’s virus (Gomez et al., 2013Gomez J.A. Wapinski O.L. Yang Y.W. Bureau J.F. Gopinath S. Monack D.M. Chang H.Y.

The NeST long ncRNA controls microbial susceptibility and epigenetic activation of the interferon-γ locus.Cell. 2013; 152: 743-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), while the lncRNA Rmrp regulates effector functions of T-helper 17 cells (Huang et al., 2015Huang W. Thomas B. Flynn R.A. Gavzy S.J. Wu L. Kim S.V. Hall J.A. Miraldi E.R. Ng C.P. Rigo F. et al.DDX5 and its associated lncRNA Rmrp modulate TH17 cell effector functions.Nature. 2015; 528: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this study, we define lincRNA-EPS (erythroid prosurvival; also known as Ttc39aos1) as an important transcriptional brake that curbs inflammatory gene expression in macrophages and in mice. Macrophages and dendritic cells express lincRNA-EPS, but it is downregulated in cells stimulated with microbial ligands, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which signals via TLR4/MD2. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of macrophages from wild-type (WT) and lincRNA-EPS−/− mice revealed that lincRNA-EPS specifically repressed the expression of IRGs in both resting and TLR4-activated cells. Consistently, gain-of-function and rescue studies further defined lincRNA-EPS as a potent repressor of IRG expression. We found that lincRNA-EPS associates with chromatin and interacts with hnRNPL, a member of a larger family of heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins, to alter nucleosome positioning and repress IRGs. Finally, lincRNA-EPS−/− mice had increased susceptibility to LPS challenge in vivo. Collectively, these results demonstrate that lincRNA-EPS is an inhibitor of IRG expression, acting as a regulatory checkpoint that is downregulated prior to the inducible expression of IRGs. Previous work from our lab utilized RNA sequencing to define the transcriptome of TLR2-activated bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and identified lincRNA-Cox2, a highly inducible lincRNA that, in turn, regulated IRG expression (Carpenter et al., 2013Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B. Henry-Bezy M. Lawrence J.B. et al.A long noncoding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.Science. 2013; 341: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). This approach also identified lncRNAs that were downregulated in macrophages stimulated through TLR2 (Figure 1A). Among these was an annotated lincRNA, lincRNA-EPS, originally identified as a regulator of erythrocyte differentiation (Hu et al., 2011Hu W. Yuan B. Flygare J. Lodish H.F. Long noncoding RNA-mediated anti-apoptotic activity in murine erythroid terminal differentiation.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 2573-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). As lincRNA-EPS was highly expressed in resting macrophages and downregulated following TLR ligation, we hypothesized that lincRNA-EPS might regulate IRG expression. We employed qRT-PCR to examine the kinetics of lincRNA-EPS expression in BMDMs exposed to TLR ligands including Pam3CSK4 (TLR2/1), LPS (TLR4), and polyinosinic-polycytydilic acid (polyI:C; TLR3). The expression of lincRNA-EPS was downregulated in response to all three TLR ligands in a time-dependent manner (Figure 1B). TLR4-mediated suppression of lincRNA-EPS was also observed in bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) (Figure 1C). Notably, lincRNA-EPS suppression in LPS-stimulated BMDMs was dose- and time-dependent and inversely correlated with levels of the proinflammatory gene IL6 (Figures S1A and S1B). TLR-dependent suppression of lincRNA-EPS was dependent on MyD88 and Trif since MyD88−/−/Trif −/− BMDMs had a reduced ability to downregulate lincRNA-EPS (Figure 1D). To evaluate the role of NF-κB, a well characterized regulator of IRGs, in controlling the suppression of lincRNA-EPS, BMDMs were pretreated with DMSO (control) or BAY11-7082, an irreversible inhibitor of the IKK kinases, followed by LPS stimulation for 6 hr. The LPS (TLR4)-mediated suppression of lincRNA-EPS was impaired in BAY11-7082-treated BMDMs relative to the control cells (Figure 1E). Induction of IL-1α mRNA, a known target of the NF-κB pathway, was impaired in these cells (Figure 1E). Consistent with these findings, LPS-induced suppression of lincRNA-EPS was also impaired in IKKβ-deficient BMDMs (Figure 1F). We also observed a similar suppression of lincRNA-EPS expression in BMDMs infected with Sendai virus or Listeria monocytogenes (Figure 1G) and in cells exposed to TNFα or type I interferon (IFN) (Figure 1H). However, stimulation of BMDMs with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, did not alter lincRNA-EPS expression or interfere with TLR4-mediated suppression of lincRNA-EPS (Figure S1C). We also found that macrophages express ∼11 lincRNA-EPS molecules per cell (Figure S1D). Collectively, these results indicate that lincRNA-EPS levels in macrophages are dynamically regulated in response to microbial and inflammatory triggers. To test our hypothesis that lincRNA-EPS regulates IRGs, we generated mice lacking lincRNA-EPS (Figures S2A–S2C) by deleting the entire 4 kb genomic locus harboring lincRNA-EPS and replacing it with a neomycin resistance cassette. The lincRNA-EPS−/− animals were healthy and reproduced at expected Mendelian frequencies with no gender bias and did not manifest any gross developmental defects (data not shown). Although this lincRNA had been implicated in erythroid differentiation (Hu et al., 2011Hu W. Yuan B. Flygare J. Lodish H.F. Long noncoding RNA-mediated anti-apoptotic activity in murine erythroid terminal differentiation.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 2573-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), features of erythropoiesis including hematocrit and hemoglobin levels and red blood cell (RBC) numbers were all normal in lincRNA-EPS−/− mice (Figure S2D). In addition the numbers of macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells were comparable in spleens of lincRNA-EPS−/− and WT animals (Figure S2E). To assess the impact of lincRNA-EPS deficiency on IRG expression in macrophages, we performed unbiased transcriptome profiling using RNA-seq in WT and lincRNA-EPS−/− BMDMs stimulated with LPS for 2 and 6 hr. The absence of lincRNA-EPS altered the expression of 113, 197, and 290 genes at 0, 2, and 6 hr post-LPS stimulation, respectively (≥2-fold change, Q-value < 0.05) (Figure 2A; Table S1). The majority of these genes were upregulated in lincRNA-EPS−/− BMDMs relative to WT BMDMs. Furthermore, mRNA levels of these genes were increased in both resting and LPS-treated conditions. A gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis demonstrated that IRGs were significantly overrepresented in these differentially expressed genes (Figure 2B). The time course indicated that lincRNA-EPS regulated the expression of many IRGs in a temporal manner, since their RNA levels were often altered at specific times following LPS treatment (Figure 2C). Among the genes that were most significantly increased were cytokines and chemokines (Cxcl10, Cxcl9, Tnfsf10, Tnfsf8, and IL-27), as well as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) including Ifit2, Rsad2 (Viperin), Oasl1, and multiple members of the guanylate-binding protein (GBP) family (Figures 2D and S2G). Genes that were differentially expressed between WT and lincRNA-EPS−/− BMDMs were often IRGs that were clustered within specific chromosomal locations (Figure 2E). In particular, a large cluster of IRGs on chromosome 5 that included Cxcl10, Cxcl9, Plac8, and several GBP-family members was upregulated in lincRNA-EPS−/− BMDMs. We further confirmed the upregulation of the chromosome-5 gene cluster (Figure 2F) and others (Figure S2H) using qRT-PCR in both untreated and LPS-stimulated (2 and 6 hr) WT and lincRNA-EPS−/− BMDMs. Moreover, we found increased levels of Cxcl10, Ccl5, and IL6 responses in lincRNA-EPS−/− BMDMs at both the mRNA (Figure 2G) and protein levels (Figure 2H). Notably, lincRNA-EPS−/− BMDMs did not display any changes in the expression of lincRNA-EPS neighboring genes Eps15 and Ttc39a relative to WT cells (Figure S2I). Furthermore, these cells also proliferated normally (Figure S2J). Together, these results indicate that lincRNA-EPS contributes in a specific manner to the temporal regulation of IRGs. We next conducted “gain-of-function” studies by generating macrophages that ectopically expressed lincRNA-EPS or vector control (EV Ctl) (Figure 3A). We stimulated these cells with LPS and measured the mRNA levels of IRGs by NanoString technology. These studies revealed that LPS-induced expression of a number of IRGs including cytokines (IL6, IL15, IL1α), chemokines (Cxcl10, Cxcl2, Ccl5, Ccl4), and antiviral ISGs (Ifit1, Oas2, Ifi204, and Rsad2/viperin) were severely impaired in lincRNA-EPS-expressing BMDMs compared to control cells (Figure 3B). We also confirmed these effects for some of these genes using qRT-PCR (Figure S3A). Also, lincRNA-EPS-mediated suppression of IRGs was observed in cells stimulated with double-stranded DNA (Figure S3B). Ectopic expression of lincRNA-EPS also impaired LPS-induced expression of IRGs in J774.1 macrophages (Figures S3C and S3D). These results collectively indicate that ectopic expression of lincRNA-EPS blocks IRG expression in macrophages.Figure S3Gain-of-Function and Rescue Studies Indicate lincRNA-EPS as a Repressor of IRG Expression in Macrophages, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Ectopic expression of lincRNA-EPS suppresses TLR4-induced expression of IRGs in macrophages. iBMDMs expressing lincRNA-EPS or the empty vector control (EV Ctl) were stimulated with LPS for 6 hr, and mRNA levels were quantified by qRT-PCR. ∗∗p < 0.01.(B) lincRNA-EPS regulates the expression of cytosolic DNA induced IRGs in macrophages.

However, ectopic expression of lincRNA-EPS in these knockout (KO) cells reduced the mRNA levels of these genes back to that observed in WT cells (Figure 3D). Similar results were obtained for additional IRGs (Figure S3E). In fetal erythroblasts, lincRNA-EPS was shown to regulate the expression of pro-apoptotic genes (Hu et al., 2011Hu W. Yuan B.

One of the proposed target genes, Pycard, encodes ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD), a critical adaptor protein required for the assembly of the inflammasome, a caspase-1-activating complex that controls the maturation of interleukin-1β (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2012Lamkanfi M. Dixit V.M. Inflammasomes and their roles in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 28: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The best-studied NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in response to microbial infections, environmental toxins, and endogenous danger signals (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2012Lamkanfi M. Dixit V.M. Inflammasomes and their roles in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 28: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). We therefore tested if activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was altered in cells expressing lincRNA-EPS. Control iBMDMs and those ectopically expressing lincRNA-EPS were exposed to LPS alone or LPS together with nigericin, a pore-forming toxin, or E. coli, which both activate Nlrp3 (Figure 3E). In both cases, production of IL-1β was severely impaired in lincRNA-EPS-overexpressing macrophages compared to control cells (Figure 3E). We subsequently compared the levels of inflammasome components and substrates by immunoblotting in WT and lincRNA-EPS-overexpressing cells (Figure 3F). While the levels of pro-IL-1β, pro-caspase-1, and Nlrp3 were all equivalent in both cell types, the levels of ASC were greatly diminished (Figure 3F). Notably, genetic rescue of ASC in these cells fully restored IL-1β responses to levels comparable to that of control cells (Figures 3G and 3H). To understand how lincRNA-EPS regulates IRGs, we examined its localization by performing sub-cellular fractionation and analyzed levels of lincRNA-EPS by qRT-PCR. This analysis revealed that lincRNA-EPS was predominantly nuclear in resting BMDMs (Figure 4A). As expected, the mature β-actin and IL-1β transcripts were localized to the cytosol, while NEAT1 (a nuclear lincRNA) was confined to the nucleus. The nuclear localization of lincRNA-EPS was also confirmed using single molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in resting primary BMDMs (Figure 4B). In these cells, the majority of detectable lincRNA-EPS foci (>80%) were nuclear (Figure 4C). Furthermore, the lincRNA-EPS FISH signal was reduced in cells exposed to LPS (Figure 4D). We next determined whether lincRNA-EPS was present in free nucleoplasmic or chromatin-associated fractions. BMDMs were chemically cross-linked to preserve endogenous chromatin-RNA complexes, and the nuclear lysates subjected to sucrose-gradient fractionation following sonication/DNase I treatment (Figure 4E). We immunoblotted histone H3 and identified chromatin-rich fractions 4–15 (Figure 4F, top). We purified RNA from three randomly selected chromatin rich-fractions (F4, F13, and F15) and performed reverse-transcription using oligo-dT primers to specifically detect mature full-length transcripts and avoid detection of nascent (pre-mRNA) transcripts. Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that lincRNA-EPS was detected across all three of these chromatin-rich fractions (Figure 4F, bottom). Importantly, β-actin and IL-1β were undetectable in these samples, while known chromatin associated lncRNAs (NEAT1 and JPX) and snRNAs (U1 and 7SK) were present. Further, histone H3 RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed by qRT-PCR analysis of co-purified RNA confirmed that the majority of mature lincRNA-EPS was associated with chromatin (Figure 4G). We next explored the possibility that lincRNA-EPS controls the expression of IRGs by regulating their transcription. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by qPCR to monitor the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to regulatory regions of IRGs that were upregulated in the absence of lincRNA-EPS. Pol II was recruited near the transcription start site (TSS) of Cxcl10, Ccl5, and Rsad2/Viperin in TLR4-activated cells (Figure 5A). However, these responses were impaired in BMDMs ectopically expressing lincRNA-EPS. We also observed similar effects at the TSS of IL6, Irf7, and ASC genes (Figure S4A). Consistent with these observations, the inducible recruitment of Pol II at Cxcl10, Ccl5, and Rsad2/Viperin genes in LPS-treated cells was enhanced in lincRNA-EPS−/− BMDMs compared to WT cells (Figure 5B). These results indicate that lincRNA-EPS regulates the expression of these IRGs at the level of transcription.Figure S4lincRNA-EPS Suppresses the Transcription of IRGs by Controlling Their Chromatin States, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Ectopic expression of lincRNA-EPS in macrophages leads to reduced RNA pol II occupancy at TLR4-activated IRGs. iBMDMs expressing ectopic lincRNA-EPS or EV Ctl were treated with LPS for 5 hr, and subjected to RNA pol II ChIP-qPCR analysis targeting the genomic regions around the TSS of indicated IRGs.(B) lincRNA-EPS deficiency leads to the deposition of active H3K4me3 marks at IRGs in the absence of activating signals.

Many epithelia are maintained by the regenerative capacity of adult stem cells. In stratified epithelia, basement membrane-resident p63+ basal cells can self-renew and often act as stem cells that give rise to differentiated progeny (Van Keymeulen and Blanpain, 2012Van Keymeulen A.

The use of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibition has further improved epithelial culture systems (Liu et al., 2012Liu X. Ory V. Chapman S. Yuan H. Albanese C. Kallakury B. Timofeeva O.A.

Despite these remarkable achievements, the prolonged expansion of adult epithelial stem cells remains challenging, and for many stratified and pseudostratified tissues there are no adequate culture systems and, importantly, no methodology to clone cells. Furthermore, feeders, as a contaminating cell population, may interfere with the mechanistic interpretation of the effects of genetic and pharmacologic manipulation. Organoid culture models offer an alternative to fibroblast co-culture systems allowing stem cells from many organs to be propagated (Barcellos-Hoff et al., 1989Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Aggeler J. Ram T.G.

However, after decades of epithelial stem cell culture research, the ability to expand and manipulate pure adult stratified and pseudostratified epithelial stem cells remains limited.

BMP signaling and cellular dynamics during regeneration of airway epithelium from basal progenitors.Development. 2016; 143: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Given their roles in diverse stem cell systems, we assessed the role of BMP and TGFβ signaling in epithelia at large. We demonstrate that BMP and TGFβ signaling activity is relatively suppressed in p63+ basal cells, but is highly active in luminal and suprabasal cells, which can represent either differentiated epithelial cells or unipotent non-basal progenitor cells (Choi et al., 2012Choi N. Zhang B. Zhang L. Ittmann M. Xin L.

Distinct stem cells contribute to mammary gland development and maintenance.Nature. 2011; 479: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). We have exploited the use of dual SMAD signaling inhibition to overcome the growth arrest and differentiation encountered in the culture of primary adult basal cells. As a result, expanded murine and human cells maintain their ability to differentiate into functional tissues. Thus, we describe a culture system that may allow for the generation of non-invasive clinically relevant disease models across many organ systems. Additionally, the methodology allows for cloning human stem cells. This, in turn, provides the key to reproducibly developing clonally derived, genetically modified human epithelia. Airway epithelia derived in this manner do lose some of their physiologic properties over time, despite preserved cell differentiation. Future work will be needed to resolve this limitation. We used the mouse trachea as a model system to understand how TGFβ/BMP/SMAD signaling regulates basal stem cell behavior. The mouse trachea contains p63+/KRT5+ basal stem cells, which can self-renew and give rise to luminal (KRT8+) secretory club cells and ciliated cells (Rock et al., 2009Rock J.R. Onaitis M.W. Rawlins E.L. Lu Y. Clark C.P. Xue Y. Randell S.H. Hogan B.L.M. Basal cells as stem cells of the mouse trachea and human airway epithelium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 12771-12775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Staining for both p-SMAD1/5/8 and p-SMAD2/3 (indicators of BMP and TGFβ signaling activity, respectively) was strongly positive in KRT8+ luminal cells (Figures 1A and 1B ). In contrast, p63+ basal stem cells displayed weak or negative p-SMAD protein expression (Figures 1A and 1B). Furthermore, co-staining of p-SMAD with lineage-specific makers revealed that 92% ± 8% of FOXJ1+ ciliated cells and 88% ± 7% of SSEA1+ secretory cells were positive for p-SMAD1/5/8, while 94% ± 10% of ciliated cells and 93% ± 9% of secretory cells were positive for p-SMAD2/3 (Figure 1F), reflecting the dual activation of BMP and TGFβ signaling in luminal epithelia. In p63+ basal stem cells, while the vast majority of cells were negative for p-SMAD, a small fraction of p63+ cells were clearly positive for p-SMAD1/5/8 (9% ± 4%) and p-SMAD2/3 (10% ± 4%) (Figure 1F). We speculated that this population represents differentiating basal cells. In fact, these p63+p-SMADlow cells also expressed a low level of KRT8, consistent with the onset of differentiation. Nearly all Ki67+ replicating cells were negative or only weakly positive for p-SMAD1/5/8 and p-SMAD2/3 (Figures 1F and 1G), suggesting an inverse relationship between proliferation and SMAD signaling activity. The p-SMAD1/5/8 and p-SMAD2/3 staining pattern in the human bronchus mimicked the pattern seen in the mouse trachea (Figures 1C–1E and 1G). Next, we examined p-SMAD status in diverse mouse epithelia developmentally derived from each of the three germ layers (Figure 2A), including ectoderm-derived (skin and mammary gland), endoderm-derived (vocal fold, esophagus, and prostate), and mesoderm-derived (epididymis) tissues. The epithelial tissues were either stratified squamous (skin, vocal fold, and esophagus) or pseudostratified (trachea, prostate, mammary gland, and epididymis). All of these epithelial tissues possess p63+ basal cells and p63− luminal and suprabasal cells that are the progeny of basal cells (such as in skin, vocal fold, esophagus, airway, and epididymis) or that self-sustain (such as in mammary gland and prostate). We found that in all of these tissues, p-SMAD1/5/8 and p-SMAD2/3 proteins were largely absent or weakly positive in p63+ basal cells and Ki67+ replicative cells, but were strongly positive in the p63− luminal and suprabasal cells (Figures 2B–2G). This consistent staining pattern suggests that the TGFβ/BMP/SMAD signaling pathways play a common role in diverse epithelia. Since p-SMAD expression was primarily present in the differentiated luminal cells of airway, we assessed whether the phosphorylation of SMAD is associated with the progression of luminal differentiation during the early course of regeneration after sulfur dioxide (SO2) injury (Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015Pardo-Saganta A. Law B.M. Tata P.R. Villoria J. Saez B. Mou H. Zhao R. Rajagopal J.

Sahay A. et al.Dedifferentiation of committed epithelial cells into stem cells in vivo.Nature. 2013; 503: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). We found that at 8 hours post-injury (8 hpi), the majority of CK8+p-SMAD+ luminal cells in the proximal airway were sloughed off or loosely attached to the trachea, leaving behind a single layer of p63+SMAD− basal stem cells (Figures 3A, 3B, and S1A). At 24 hpi, we observed massive proliferation and expansion of basal cells (Figures S1B and S1C). These replicating cells, which were p63+ but KRT8−, were negative for p-SMAD (Figures 3A, 3B, and S1A–S1C). Recently, we have demonstrated that c-MYB-expressing basal cells and N2ICD-expressing basal cells start to segregate as early as 6 hr after SO2 injury, are fully segregated by 24 hr post-injury, and differentiate into ciliated and secretory cells, respectively (Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015Pardo-Saganta A. Law B.M. Tata P.R. Villoria J. Saez B. Mou H. Zhao R. Rajagopal J. Injury induces direct lineage segregation of functionally distinct airway basal stem/progenitor cell subpopulations.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 184-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This suggests that the phosphorylation of SMAD is not involved in the cell-fate segregation of basal stem cells during regeneration, but rather is associated with the actual process of luminal cell formation, as marked by KRT8 expression. Indeed, luminal cells at 48 hpi began to express KRT8, coincident with increasing SMAD phosphorylation (Figures 3A, 3B, and S1A–S1C). By 72 hpi, the luminal cells further differentiated and began to express mature lineage-specific markers (Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015Pardo-Saganta A. Law B.M. Tata P.R. Villoria J. Saez B. Mou H.

Consistently, these luminal cells were now strongly positive for p-SMAD, while basal stem cells remained p-SMAD weak or negative (Figures 3A, 3B, and S1A–S1C). We also examined SMAD phosphorylation during human airway stem cell mucociliary differentiation in air-liquid interface (ALI) culture (Figure S1D). 12 hr after ALI initiation (day 0.5), stem cells remained p63+KRT8− and also negative for both p-SMAD1/5/8 and p-SMAD2/3 (Figure S1E). The following day (day 1.5), the cells began to stratify to form a differentiated second layer of KRT8+p-SMAD+ cells (Figure S1E). Some p63+ cells were also positive for p-SMAD, perhaps suggesting that they are actively differentiating (Figure S1E). At days 2.5 and 3.5, more KRT8+p-SMAD+ differentiated cells appeared, while the p63+ basal cells were entirely p-SMAD negative or weak (Figure S1E). At day 13.5, when the luminal cells have already matured into ciliated cells and secretory cells, the phosphorylation of SMAD remained strongly positive in KRT8+ luminal cells, but was largely absent or weak in KRT5+ basal cells (Figure S1E). Thus, activation of SMAD signaling correlates with the appearance of KRT8+ luminal cells in both mouse and human airway epithelial differentiation (Figure 3B). Furthermore, phosphorylation of SMAD is persistent in mature airway luminal cells. Next, we tested whether SMAD signaling blockade inhibits mucociliary differentiation. We isolated GSIβ4+EpCAM+ murine airway basal stem cells (Zhao et al., 2014Zhao R. Fallon T.R. Saladi S.V. Pardo-Saganta A. Villoria J. Mou H. Vinarsky V. Gonzalez-Celeiro M. Nunna N.

Mucociliary differentiation from the airway stem cells was performed using standard ALI culture. 2 weeks after initiation of ALI, a mature airway epithelium generated from WT-infected cells consisted of ciliated cells and secretory cells. Deletion of BMPRIA, TGFβRII, and SMAD4 resulted in significantly fewer differentiated cells (Figure 3C). Consistent with this finding, loss of BMPRIA, TGFβRII, and SMAD4 all resulted in airway epithelia with increased stratification and basal cells co-labeled with KRT8 (Figure 3D), suggesting that many basal stem cells have been trapped in a transitional state while differentiating into KRT8+ luminal cells. Such differentiating cells are rarely found in the normal airway epithelium. We also used BMP and TGFβ antagonists to examine mucociliary differentiation when BMP signaling or/and TGFβ signaling was blocked (Figure 3E). In controls, airway basal cells differentiated into airway epithelium with high efficiency after 2 weeks. In the presence of BMP antagonist (DMH-1) or TGFβ antagonist (A-83-01), fewer ciliated cells and club cells were generated. When both antagonists were used, the effect was more pronounced, with a >95% decrease in the production of differentiated cells (Figure 3E). Similarly, treatment with BMP and TGFβ antagonists induced basal cell hyperplasia with hyper-proliferative KRT5+/p63+ cells and transitional KRT5+/KRT8+ cells lining the luminal compartment (Figure 3F). Of note, ciliated cells and club cells did appear after prolonged ALI culture, even in the presence of the dual BMP/TGFβ inhibitors (Figure S1G). However, those ciliated and club cells that escaped inactivation were positive for p-SMAD staining (data not shown), supporting the tight association of differentiation with p-SMAD status. In summary, both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition abrogated efficient generation of secretory and ciliated cells, suggesting that SMAD activation promotes continued differentiation of early committed cells to terminal maturation. Blockade of SMAD signaling also compromised mucociliary differentiation in human cells. Differentiation was significantly suppressed when SMAD4 expression was reduced (Figures S1H and S1I). Only a small number of ciliated cells with truncated cilia were detected and club cells were nearly absent after 2 weeks of ALI culture (Figure S1I). Again, prolonged differentiation was associated with some mucociliary differentiation (Figure 1J). Consistently, the epithelia derived from SMAD4 shRNA-treated cells have numerous KRT5+KRT8+ and p63+KRT8+ cells trapped in transitional state. We also observed more Ki67+ cells in the SMAD4 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) epithelia compared to controls, suggesting that SMAD loss leads to increased proliferation (Figure S1J). These data indicate cross-species conservation in the requirement for SMAD signaling to execute epithelial differentiation. Based on our observations that SMAD signaling is highly activated in non-cycling and differentiated luminal cells, we hypothesized that SMAD pathway inhibition would promote airway stem cell growth in vitro. Thus, we cultured human airway stem cells in various conditions (Figure 4A). Both BMP4 (50 ng/ml) and TGFβ (10 ng/ml) strongly suppressed cell growth. ROCK inhibitor (10 μM) alone modestly promoted cell expansion. However, both DMH-1 (1 μM) and A-83-01 (1 μM) greatly stimulated cell expansion. The three inhibitors together had the most profound effect (Figure 4A). The resultant cells were homogenous, small, and tightly packed, as is expected for stem cells. All cells were positive for KRT5 and p63, and >85% of cells were positive for Ki67 (Figure 4A). We also examined commonly used SMAD signaling inhibitors and found that they all similarly promoted cell growth (Figures S2A and S2B). Furthermore, we tested multiple previously reported culture media, including BEGM (Fulcher et al., 2005Fulcher M.L. Gabriel S. Burns K.A. Yankaskas J.R. Randell S.H. Well-differentiated human airway epithelial cell cultures.Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 107: 183-206PubMed Google Scholar) and HTEK (You and Brody, 2013You Y. Brody S.L. Culture and differentiation of mouse tracheal epithelial cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 945: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Figure S2C). Again, dual TGFβ/BMP inhibitors greatly enhanced cell proliferation in each of these media formulations. BMP and TGFβ are known to act through pathways other than the canonical SMAD pathway, including the MEK/MAPK, PI3K, and PKC-related cascades. Therefore, we tested the growth of human airway stem cells in the presence of their corresponding inhibitors. These compounds either had no effect or a detrimental effect on cell growth, suggesting that BMP and TGFβ inhibitors are indeed acting through SMAD (Figure S2D). Next, we examined whether TGFβ/BMP inhibitors allow long-term expansion of human airway stem cells without fibroblast feeders. In the control medium, cells can be passaged only to P6 (∼20 doublings at a 1:10 splitting ratio; Figure 4B). Cells grown in the presence of TGFβ or BMP4 did not expand beyond P1. With dual TGFβ/BMP inhibition, however, cells were able to expand to P18–P25 without a loss of replicative potential (∼60–80 doublings, n = 9; Figure 4B). They divided faster and were more homogenous in size in contrast to controls (Figure 4B). Nearly all cells expressed the stem cell markers, as well as the transcription factors that define airway epithelial cell identity (Figures S2E and S2F). We did not detect KRT8 expression in the replicative p63+ cells (data not shown), suggesting that dual TGFβ/BMP inhibitors completely blocked differentiation in 2D culture. Furthermore, TGFβ/BMP inhibition enabled single-cell cloning. Human airway stem cells from two healthy subjects were sorted as singles and individually expanded to test their proliferation potential and mucociliary differentiation capacity following cloning. All clones examined had full capacity for significant expansion and multipotent differentiation into ciliated cells and secretory cells (Figure S2G). We also assessed our ability to expand bronchial stem cells from two patients harboring the ΔF508/ΔF508-CFTR mutation (Figure S2H). With control medium, the cells reached an expected expansion barrier at P4 and P5, whereas in the presence of TGFβ/BMP inhibitors, these cell lines expanded to P12 and P17 and remained proliferative (Figure S2H). A similar effect was seen in mouse tracheal stem cell culture. Dual TGFβ/BMP inhibition strongly enhanced cell proliferation (Figure 4C). As a result, mouse tracheal stem cells can be expanded in a feeder-free culture system for a considerably larger number of passages than previously possible, while maintaining normal cell morphology and preserved stem cell identity (Figure 4D). Loss of TGFβ signaling has been previously noted to lead to tumor formation in stratified epithelia (Guasch et al., 2007Guasch G. Schober M. Pasolli H.A. Conn E.B. Polak L. Fuchs E. Loss of TGFbeta signaling destabilizes homeostasis and promotes squamous cell carcinomas in stratified epithelia.Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 313-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To assess whether serial passaging is associated with tumorigenesis, we transplanted expanded human and mouse airway stem cells and human lung cancer A549 cells subcutaneously into NSG mice (Figure S2I). A549 cells robustly generated tumors in all cases after 2–8 weeks, with a latency determined by the number of injected cells (Figure S2I). We did not retrieve a single tissue outgrowth 8 months after injection of expanded human airway stem cells. Transplanted expanded mouse tracheal stem cells formed cystic structures, and immunofluorescence demonstrated that the"

It has been reported that let-7 repression by an antisense inhibitor can promote reprogramming (Melton et al., 2010Melton C. Judson R.L. Blelloch R. Opposing microRNA families regulate self-renewal in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2010; 463: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), but whether LIN28A and LIN28B regulate pluripotency entirely through let-7-dependent mechanisms, and whether the two paralogs play different roles, have not been explored. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have unique metabolic properties (Zhang et al., 2012Zhang J. Nuebel E. Daley G.Q. Koehler C.M. Teitell M.A. Metabolic regulation in pluripotent stem cells during reprogramming and self-renewal.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Somatic cell reprogramming resets cellular metabolism to a state of relatively high glycolysis and low oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) (Folmes et al., 2011Folmes C.D. Nelson T.J.

PSCs also rely on one-carbon metabolism for histone methylation and maintenance of pluripotency (Shiraki et al., 2014Shiraki N. Shiraki Y. Tsuyama T. Obata F. Miura M. Nagae G. Aburatani H. Kume K.

It is unknown what role LIN28 plays in conferring naive versus primed pluripotent cell fates and their associated metabolic status. While we previously reported that LIN28 regulates glucose metabolism through let-7-dependent mTOR signaling in the context of whole-animal physiology (Zhu et al., 2011Zhu H. Shyh-Chang N. Segrè A.V. Shinoda G. Shah S.P. Einhorn W.S. Takeuchi A. Engreitz J.M. Hagan J.P. Kharas M.G. et al.DIAGRAM ConsortiumMAGIC InvestigatorsThe Lin28/let-7 axis regulates glucose metabolism.Cell. 2011; 147: 81-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), here, we reveal let-7- independent roles of LIN28 in regulating oxidative metabolism in mouse PSCs, including in Dgcr8−/− embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which lack microRNA (Wang et al., 2007Wang Y. Medvid R. Melton C. Jaenisch R. Blelloch R. DGCR8 is essential for microRNA biogenesis and silencing of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), and roles of LIN28 in regulating one-carbon metabolism and PSC fate. Through functional analyses of metabolism, quantitative metabolomics and proteomics, and in vitro biochemistry, we demonstrate that LIN28A and LIN28B alter expression of metabolism genes that contribute to the unique metabotypes and cell states of pluripotency. We first asked whether overexpression of LIN28B could function equivalently to LIN28A to promote efficient reprogramming of human somatic cells, and we found that both human LIN28A and LIN28B conferred ∼4- to 6-fold increases in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) colony formation when added to the OSN cocktail (Figure 1A). OSNB-derived iPSCs stained for SSEA-4 and TRA-1-60 expressed pluripotency genes and formed teratomas consisting of all three germ layers, indicating that they were bona fide fully reprogrammed PSCs (Figures S1A–S1C). To assess whether depletion of LIN28A or LIN28B similarly affected generation of OSKM-derived iPSCs, we infected dH1f human fibroblasts with small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against LIN28A or LIN28B prior to OSKM transduction and observed a significant reduction (>80%) of reprogramming efficiency for both paralogs (Figures 1B and S1D). To assess the LIN28 paralogs in murine reprogramming, we derived mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Lin28a−/−, Lin28b−/−, and Lin28a−/−b−/− double-knockout embryos (Shinoda et al., 2013Shinoda G. Shyh-Chang N. Soysa T.Y. Zhu H. Seligson M.T. Shah S.P. Abo-Sido N. Yabuuchi A. Hagan J.P.

Taken together, these data suggest that LIN28B can promote reprogramming, comparably to LIN28A, when ectopically expressed but that both endogeneous genes are required for optimal reprogramming efficiency, implying complementary and incompletely redundant functions. While mouse Lin28a−/− OSKM-derived iPSCs appeared morphologically similar to wild-type iPSCs, Lin28b−/− and Lin28a−/−b−/− iPSC colonies appeared flatter (Figure 1E, top) but continued to stain for SSEA-1 and OCT4 by immunohistochemistry (Figure S1E). Lin28a−/−b−/− iPSCs cultured in leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/serum media expressed most pluripotency marker genes at levels comparable to wild-type iPSCs, such as Oct4-Pou5f1, Sall4, and Nr5a2, but were lower for other marker genes, such as Zfp42, Sox2, Tbx3, Nanog, and Gdf3 (Figure S1F). Interestingly, addition of the Mek/Erk pathway inhibitor PD0325901 and the GSK3β pathway inhibitor CHIR99021 (2i; Marks et al., 2012Marks H. Kalkan T. Menafra R. Denissov S. Jones K. Hofemeister H. Nichols J. Kranz A. Stewart A.F. Smith A. Stunnenberg H.G. The transcriptional and epigenomic foundations of ground state pluripotency.Cell. 2012; 149: 590-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) to the LIF/serum media completely restored knockout iPSC morphology (Figure 1E, bottom) and expression of the pluripotent marker genes except for Zfp42 (Figure S1G). Indeed, knockout cells cultured with 2i showed a modest increase of naive pluripotent markers Klf4, Tbx3, Esrrb, Nr5a2, and Nanog compared to wild-type cells (Figures S1G and S1H). Strikingly, they also resisted conversion to a primed state and maintained a dome-shape morphology and pluripotent gene expression after 5 days in primed media with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)/activin (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1I), suggesting Lin28 promotes exit from the naive state of mouse PSCs. Overexpressing let-7 also delayed priming, indicating let-7-dependency (Figure S1J). Lin28a and Lin28b also responded to FGF2 signaling, as they were upregulated upon switching from LIF/2i media to LIF/serum or FGF2/activin media, similar to other primed state marker genes Otx2 and Fgf5 (Marks et al., 2012Marks H. Kalkan T. Menafra R. Denissov S. Jones K. Hofemeister H. Nichols J. Kranz A. Stewart A.F. Smith A. Stunnenberg H.G. The transcriptional and epigenomic foundations of ground state pluripotency.Cell. 2012; 149: 590-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) (Figure 1H). Despite defects in priming, Lin28 knockout mouse iPSCs contributed to chimeras and formed teratomas with tissues from all three germ layers, demonstrating they are dispensable for maintaining pluripotency (Figures S1K and S1L). Lin28 has been shown to confer a proliferative advantage during reprogramming (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Saha K. Pando B. van Zon J. Lengner C.J. Creyghton M.P. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R. Direct cell reprogramming is a stochastic process amenable to acceleration.Nature. 2009; 462: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). While the difference in the proliferation rate in Lin28a−/− or Lin28b−/− iPSCs was not significant, Lin28a−/−b−/− iPSCs proliferated more slowly than wild-type iPSCs (Figure 1I). To define the kinetics of endogenous LIN28A and LIN28B gene reactivation during OSKM-induced reprogramming, we examined mRNA levels of the hTERT-immortalized human fibroblast cell line hiF-T fibroblasts (Cacchiarelli et al., 2015Cacchiarelli D. Trapnell C. Ziller M.J. Soumillon M. Cesana M. Karnik R. Donaghey J. Smith Z.D. Ratanasirintrawoot S. Zhang X. et al.Integrative analyses of human reprogramming reveal dynamic nature of induced pluripotency.Cell. 2015; 162: 412-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) at different time points during reprogramming (Figure 2A). Interestingly, mRNA for endogenous LIN28B was detected as early as day 2 and was more than half maximal by day 4, while mRNA for endogenous LIN28A was not detected until days 8–10 and did not achieve maximal expression until late in reprogramming, implying differential gene reactivation. Isolation of the TRA-1-60+ population of cells late in reprogramming showed enriched expression of LIN28A, but not LIN28B (Figure S2A), implicating LIN28A as a stringent marker that is only upregulated upon acquisition of pluripotency, in contrast to LIN28B, which is a more promiscuous marker. We also examined the expression of the two paralogs in partially and fully OSKM-derived reprogrammed human cells (Chan et al., 2009Chan E.M. Ratanasirintrawoot S. Park I.H. Manos P.D. Loh Y.H. Huo H. Miller J.D. Hartung O. Rho J. Ince T.A. et al.Live cell imaging distinguishes bona fide human iPS cells from partially reprogrammed cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and found that LIN28A and a few other markers, such as TDGF1, REX1, DAZL, DNMT3B, DPPA2/3, and ABCG2, were exclusively expressed in fully reprogrammed iPSCs, whereas LIN28B, NANOG, SALL4, GDF3, DPPA4, and DNMT3A were expressed in both partially and fully reprogrammed cells (Figures 2B, S2B, and S2C). Interestingly, microarray analysis between partially and fully reprogrammed cells positioned LIN28A as the most differentially expressed gene (Figure S2D), together suggesting that late LIN28A expression marks bona fide iPSCs. We next analyzed histone modifications associated with the LIN28A and LIN28B promoters at different time points during reprogramming in hiF-T fibroblasts (Figure 2C). At baseline, we detected H3K27me3 on the LIN28A promoter, consistent with its lack of expression in fibroblasts, while we detected both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 on the LIN28B promoter, a bivalent mark associated with loci poised for expression. On day 5, H3K27me3 was still associated with the LIN28A locus, while the LIN28B locus was marked by H3K27ac, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3, all consistent with active LIN28B transcription. At day 24, LIN28A was expressed ten times higher than LIN28B (Figure 2A), and its gene body showed enhanced H3K36me3 that marks actively transcribed genes (Figure 2C). Consistent with the active chromatin state and expression of LIN28A in hiF-T-iPSCs (Figure 2C), analyses of existing genome-wide ChIP-sequencing data (Gifford et al., 2013Gifford C.A. Ziller M.J. Gu H. Trapnell C. Donaghey J. Tsankov A. Shalek A.K. Kelley D.R. Shishkin A.A. Issner R. et al.Transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics during specification of human embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2013; 153: 1149-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) as well as ChIP-PCR showed that OCT4 has stronger binding at LIN28A promoter in PSCs (Figures 2D, 2E, and S2E). Together, these data suggest that for the human fibroblast cells we examined, the LIN28B locus assumes an active chromatin structure and re-activates gene expression earlier in reprogramming, while only later does LIN28A gain an open chromatin structure and gene activation and mark the bona fide reprogrammed cells. To further understand the molecular mechanisms by which LIN28A and LIN28B promote reprogramming, we performed microarray analysis with mouse wild-type and Lin28-deficient PSCs (Figure S3). Analysis of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using the CellNet algorithm (Cahan et al., 2014Cahan P. Li H. Morris S.A. Lummertz da Rocha E. Daley G.Q. Collins J.J. CellNet: network biology applied to stem cell engineering.Cell. 2014; 158: 903-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) revealed that Lin28a−/−b−/− iPSCs have a slightly altered ESC GRN (Figure S3B). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the Lin28b−/− expression signature was enriched with metabolism-related GO terms such as “Mitochondrial inner membrane,” “NADH dehydrogenase activity,” and “Oxidative phosphorylation” and with amino acid-related metabolism terms such as “Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism,” while the Lin28a−/− signature was enriched in “regulation of glucose metabolic process” (Figure S3D), suggesting that both paralogs influence cellular metabolism. To dissect how LIN28A and LIN28B regulate metabolism, we measured cellular energetics of the mouse PSCs. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR)/extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) ratios for Lin28b−/− and Lin28a−/−b−/− were increased relative to wild-type cells, resembling the more oxidative metabolic profile of MEFs (Figure 3A). Further analysis indicated that both Lin28a−/− and Lin28b−/− PSCs have elevated OCR (Figure S4A), while Lin28a−/− cells also have increased secretion of lactate, ECAR and LDHB protein (Figures S4A and S4C). These data indicate that both LIN28A and LIN28B repress OxPhos, while LIN28A might also repress glycolysis, in the context of mouse PSCs. The combined endogenous expression of LIN28A and LIN28B in wild-type cells corresponds with a more glycolytic and less oxidative metabolism reminiscent of the Warburg effect of cancer cells (Figure 3B), as reflected by their additive role in enhancing proliferation (Figure 1I). Elevated OCR in knockout cells is also consistent with more densely packed mitochondrial inner membrane cristae (Figure S4D). Overexpressing Lin28b in Lin28a−/−b−/− iPSCs partially rescued the skewed metabolic phenotype (Figure 3C), consistent with the role of Lin28b in knockout cells. To confirm the effects of LIN28A and LIN28B on PSC OxPhos, we also analyzed doxycycline-inducible Lin28a/b-overexpressing mouse ESCs (Zhu et al., 2011Zhu H. Shyh-Chang N. Segrè A.V. Shinoda G. Shah S.P. Einhorn W.S. Takeuchi A. Engreitz J.M. Hagan J.P. Kharas M.G. et al.DIAGRAM ConsortiumMAGIC InvestigatorsThe Lin28/let-7 axis regulates glucose metabolism.Cell. 2011; 147: 81-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) and found that induction of Lin28a/b compromised basal and maximal OCR (Figures S4E and S4F), consistent with the loss-of-function lines (Figure S4B). Despite the hyper-induction of Lin28 in ESCs, the levels of let-7 did not change from their already suppressed levels (Figure S4G). In addition, either introducing a mature let-7 mimic or inhibiting let-7 with LNA (Figure 3D), or overexpressing let-7 (Figure S4H) in wild-type cells did not change OCR, and transfection of a let-7 mimic in Lin28-overexpressing cells did not reverse the reduced OCR (Figure S4I), suggesting that LIN28 reduced OCR through let-7-independent mechanisms. To further exclude microRNA-dependent functions of LIN28A/B, we also assessed Dgcr8−/− mouse ESCs that are defective for microRNA biogenesis (Melton et al., 2010Melton C. Judson R.L. Blelloch R. Opposing microRNA families regulate self-renewal in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2010; 463: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2007Wang Y. Medvid R. Melton C. Jaenisch R. Blelloch R. DGCR8 is essential for microRNA biogenesis and silencing of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Whereas knockdown of Lin28a resulted in upregulation of let-7 in wild-type ESCs, knockdown in Dgcr8−/− ESCs did not affect the already scant quantities of let-7 (Figures S4J and S4K). Importantly, knockdown of either LIN28A or LIN28B in Dgcr8−/− ESCs resulted in a more oxidative phenotype, with 1.5- to 2-fold increase of OCR compared to control Dgcr8−/− ESCs (Figure 3E). Given the lack of microRNA function in Dgcr8−/− cells, these data demonstrate that LIN28A and LIN28B alter metabolism at least in part via let-7-independent mechanisms. We previously reported that induction of LIN28A in transgenic mice promotes glucose tolerance and tissue repair (Shyh-Chang et al., 2013aShyh-Chang N. Locasale J.W. Lyssiotis C.A. Zheng Y. Teo R.Y. Ratanasirintrawoot S. Zhang J. Onder T. Unternaehrer J.J. Zhu H. et al.Influence of threonine metabolism on S-adenosylmethionine and histone methylation.Science. 2013; 339: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, Zhu et al., 2011Zhu H.

Kharas M.G. et al.DIAGRAM ConsortiumMAGIC InvestigatorsThe Lin28/let-7 axis regulates glucose metabolism.Cell. 2011; 147: 81-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Thus, we next asked whether LIN28A and LIN28B promote glucose metabolism in PSCs by tracing 13C-glucose incorporation into metabolic pathway intermediate metabolites. Loss of LIN28A and LIN28B in mouse PSCs reduced 13C labeling of glycolysis intermediates (Figure S5B). Acute Lin28a/b knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) also led to slightly reduced 13C labeling of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates in cells cultured in LIF/serum media (Figures S5C and S5D). Interestingly, switching culture conditions to LIF/2i naive media greatly increased glucose incorporation into the TCA cycle intermediates (Figure S5E), as recently reported (Carey et al., 2015Carey B.W. Finley L.W.S. Cross J.R. Allis C.D. Thompson C.B. Intracellular α-ketoglutarate maintains the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2015; 518: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), rescued the defects in glucose incorporation (Figure S5F), and enhanced the maintenance of knockout cells over multiple passages (Figure S5G). We also analyzed glutamine incorporation as well as steady-state metabolomics of cells cultured in LIF/2i media and found increased glutamine incorporation into the TCA cycle metabolites through oxidative metabolism (Figure S5H) and markedly increased absolute levels of TCA cycle metabolites in knockout cells, such as α-ketoglutarate, succinate, isocitrate, and oxaloacetate/aspartate (Figures 3F–3H), consistent with increased mitochondrial oxidative function. Interestingly, high α-ketoglutarate in ESCs is associated with naive pluripotency (Carey et al., 2015Carey B.W. Finley L.W.S. Cross J.R. Allis C.D. Thompson C.B. Intracellular α-ketoglutarate maintains the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2015; 518: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). We also found that supplemental α-ketoglutarate delayed naive to primed transition (Figure S5I), while reducing α-ketoglutarate by glutamine withdrawal accelerated the conversion (Figure S5J), presumably by increasing H3K9me3 (Carey et al., 2015Carey B.W. Finley L.W.S. Cross J.R. Allis C.D. Thompson C.B. Intracellular α-ketoglutarate maintains the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2015; 518: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) (Figure S5K). Altogether, the above functional and metabolomics data indicate that LIN28 represses mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in PSCs and plays a role in regulating the unique metabolic states of mouse"

However, the plasticity of HIV-1 demands additional improvements to these mAbs to better ensure their clinical utility. Here, we report engineered bispecific antibodies that are the most potent and broad HIV-neutralizing antibodies to date. One bispecific antibody, 10E8V2.0/iMab, neutralized 118 HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses tested with a mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.002 μg/mL. 10E8V2.0/iMab also potently neutralized 99% of viruses in a second panel of 200 HIV-1 isolates belonging to clade C, the dominant subtype accounting for ∼50% of new infections worldwide. Importantly, 10E8V2.0/iMab reduced virus load substantially in HIV-1-infected humanized mice and also provided complete protection when administered prior to virus challenge. These bispecific antibodies hold promise as novel prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents in the fight against HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2419951851,"Ligand-directed signal bias offers opportunities for sculpting molecular events, with the promise of better, safer therapeutics. Critical to the exploitation of signal bias is an understanding of the molecular events coupling ligand binding to intracellular signaling. Activation of class B G protein-coupled receptors is driven by interaction of the peptide N terminus with the receptor core. To understand how this drives signaling, we have used advanced analytical methods that enable separation of effects on pathway-specific signaling from those that modify agonist affinity and mapped the functional consequence of receptor modification onto three-dimensional models of a receptor-ligand complex. This yields molecular insights into the initiation of receptor activation and the mechanistic basis for biased agonism. Our data reveal that peptide agonists can engage different elements of the receptor extracellular face to achieve effector coupling and biased signaling providing a foundation for rational design of biased agonists."

Despite the profound benefits of anti-Env bNAb therapy for the control of HIV-1 infection, two main limitations exist: (1) no single bNAb has the capacity to efficiently neutralize all virus strains, and (2) bNAb administration is often associated with the emergence of virus escape mutants in the respective bNAb-targeting epitope (Diskin et al., 2013Diskin R.

Co-administration of two or more bNAbs with non-overlapping epitope specificities is, therefore, necessary to overcome these limitations and confer robust control of HIV-1 replication (Klein et al., 2012bKlein F. Halper-Stromberg A. Horwitz J.A. Gruell H. Scheid J.F. Bournazos S. Mouquet H. Spatz L.A. Diskin R.

Indeed, previous studies in murine models of HIV-1 infection indicated that the use of single bNAbs is inadequate for effective control of virus replication, as the administered bNAb often exerts significant selection pressure on the virus, leading to the rapid generation of escape mutants (Diskin et al., 2013Diskin R.

These limitations suggest the development of a new class of antibody-based molecules that would combine the breadth, potency, and antigenic specificity of two bNAbs required for the effective control of HIV-1 infection. Indeed, bispecific anti-Env bNAbs (biNAbs) represent an attractive strategy for the prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection, as they offer unique advantages over conventional, monospecific antibodies, providing a compelling platform for the development of single therapeutic molecules with improved in vivo protective activity. Recent attempts to generate anti-HIV-1 bispecific antibody-based molecules mainly focused on targeting HIV-1-infected cells through the use of anti-Env specificities combined with anti-CD3 (Pegu et al., 2015Pegu A. Asokan M. Wu L. Wang K. Hataye J. Casazza J.P. Guo X. Shi W. Georgiev I. Zhou T. et al.Activation and lysis of human CD4 cells latently infected with HIV-1.Nat.

Invest. 2015; 125: 4077-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a concept originally developed for anti-tumor bispecific molecules (Chames and Baty, 2009Chames P. Baty D. Bispecific antibodies for cancer therapy: the light at the end of the tunnel?.MAbs. 2009; 1: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This approach induces clearance of HIV-1-infected cells by increasing the recruitment of cytotoxic T cells to Env-expressing infected cells, promoting their lysis. Since these molecules specifically target infected cells without any direct effects on virus neutralization, their use in prophylactic regiments to block HIV-1 infection is rather limited. Additionally, despite the reported low toxicity of these molecules, targeting host receptors like CD3 still poses concerns over the long-term safety of this approach, especially in HIV-1-infected, immunocompromised individuals. In addition, such molecules exhibit a relatively short half-life, as their interaction with host cells enhances their clearance from circulation. Likewise, limitations associated with targeting host receptors (e.g., toxicity, enhanced clearance) are also expected for anti-CD4/anti-Env bispecific antibodies (Pace et al., 2013Pace C.S. Song R. Ochsenbauer C. Andrews C.D. Franco D. Yu J. Oren D.A. Seaman M.S. Ho D.D. Bispecific antibodies directed to CD4 domain 2 and HIV envelope exhibit exceptional breadth and picomolar potency against HIV-1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 13540-13545Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we aimed to develop and characterize biNAbs targeting exclusively the HIV-1 Env trimer, focusing particularly on the optimization of these biNAbs to exhibit significantly improved, neutralization activity, compared to unmodified, monospecific bNAbs. Although several strategies have been previously described for the generation of antibodies or antibody-based molecules with dual specificities (Spiess et al., 2015Spiess C. Zhai Q. Carter P.J. Alternative molecular formats and therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies.Mol. Immunol. 2015; 67: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), in the present study, a major prerequisite for the development of anti-HIV-1 Env biNAbs was to maintain the physiological immunoglobulin G (IgG) architecture, thereby preserving the favorable pharmacokinetic properties of IgG (half-life of 3 weeks for human IgG1) and its Fc effector function, which has been previously shown to contribute to the in vivo protective activity of anti-HIV-1 bNAbs (Bournazos et al., 2014Bournazos S. Klein F. Pietzsch J. Seaman M.S. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V.

Previous attempts to generate anti-HIV-1 Env biNAbs based on the IgG1 structure yielded biNAbs with high breadth and potency, as well as sufficient in vivo stability and half-life (Asokan et al., 2015Asokan M. Rudicell R.S. Louder M. McKee K. O’Dell S. Stewart-Jones G. Wang K. Xu L. Chen X. Choe M. et al.Bispecific antibodies targeting different epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope exhibit broad and potent neutralization.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 12501-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, none of these anti-Env biNAbs exhibited improved neutralization potency compared to their respective parental bNAbs, suggesting that IgG1 biNAbs offer no advantages over conventional, monospecific bNAbs (Asokan et al., 2015Asokan M. Rudicell R.S. Louder M. McKee K. O’Dell S. Stewart-Jones G. Wang K. Xu L. Chen X. Choe M. et al.Bispecific antibodies targeting different epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope exhibit broad and potent neutralization.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 12501-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We therefore aimed to generate anti-Env biNAbs with improved neutralization potency by exploiting the unusual structure of the IgG3 hinge domain engineered to increase Fab domain flexibility, thereby favoring hetero-bivalent interactions with the Env trimer. Using this strategy and a panel of bNAbs targeting distinct epitopes on the HIV-1 Env, we have generated and characterized the in vitro neutralization activity of several biNAb combinations, identifying particular biNAbs with evidence for synergistic activity i.e., exhibiting increased neutralization potency compared to their respective parental, monospecific bNAbs. These hinge-domain-engineered biNAbs exhibited improved neutralization potency and enhanced in vivo protective activity in HIV-1-infected humanized mice, suggesting their potential clinical use for the control of HIV-1 infection in humans. To study the activity of anti-Env biNAbs, we initially selected two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with broad and potent in vitro and in vivo activity: 3BNC117 (Scheid et al., 2011Scheid J.F. Mouquet H. Ueberheide B. Diskin R. Klein F. Oliveira T.Y. Pietzsch J. Fenyo D. Abadir A. Velinzon K. et al.Sequence and structural convergence of broad and potent HIV antibodies that mimic CD4 binding.Science. 2011; 333: 1633-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and 10-1074 (Mouquet et al., 2012Mouquet H. Scharf L. Euler Z. Liu Y. Eden C. Scheid J.F. Halper-Stromberg A. Gnanapragasam P.N. Spencer D.I.

USA. 2012; 109: E3268-E3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), which target the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) and the V3 sites of Env, respectively. For the generation of 3BNC117/10-1074 biNAbs, we used a combination of previously described strategies (Merchant et al., 1998Merchant A.M. Zhu Z. Yuan J.Q. Goddard A. Adams C.W. Presta L.G. Carter P. An efficient route to human bispecific IgG.Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, Ridgway et al., 1996Ridgway J.B. Presta L.G.

USA. 2011; 108: 11187-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) to ensure the proper pairing of the heavy and light chains of the two parental mAbs and generation of heavy-chain heterodimers (Figure 1A). Pairing of the correct heavy chain with the respective light chain was achieved by swapping the CH1 domain with the constant domain of the light chain (CL) for one mAb (10-1074) while preserving the wild-type domain organization for the other mAb (3BNC117) (Schaefer et al., 2011Schaefer W.

Georges G. Kettenberger H. Imhof-Jung S. et al.Immunoglobulin domain crossover as a generic approach for the production of bispecific IgG antibodies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 11187-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) had no measurable effect on the antigenic specificity and neutralization activity of the 10-1074 mAb, as determined by antigen (gp140)-specific ELISA and TZMbl-based in vitro neutralization assay (Montefiori, 2005Montefiori D.C. Evaluating neutralizing antibodies against HIV, SIV, and SHIV in luciferase reporter gene assays.Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2005; 12 (Unit 12.11)PubMed Google Scholar) against an extended multiclade virus panel, respectively (Figures 1B and 1C). Heterodimerization of the heavy chain was achieved by introducing mutations into the CH3 domain that alter the physical and chemical properties of the two mAb heavy chains, favoring heterodimer formation (Merchant et al., 1998Merchant A.M. Zhu Z. Yuan J.Q. Goddard A. Adams C.W. Presta L.G. Carter P. An efficient route to human bispecific IgG.Nat.

Carter P. ‘Knobs-into-holes’ engineering of antibody CH3 domains for heavy chain heterodimerization.Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (Asokan et al., 2015Asokan M. Rudicell R.S. Louder M. McKee K. O’Dell S. Stewart-Jones G. Wang K. Xu L. Chen X.

An efficient route to human bispecific IgG.Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), this approach resulted in efficient expression of biNAbs, typically yielding >90% heterodimers. By taking advantage of the differences in the light-chain isotype (κ for 3BNC117 and λ for 10-1074) and the Env epitope specificity (CD4bs and V3 for 3BNC117 and 10-1074, respectively), competition and epitope-specific ELISA assays confirmed the dual specificity of the resulting 3BCN117/10-1074 biNAb (Figures 1D–1F). Using a standardized TZMbl assay (Montefiori, 2005Montefiori D.C. Evaluating neutralizing antibodies against HIV, SIV, and SHIV in luciferase reporter gene assays.Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2005; 12 (Unit 12.11)PubMed Google Scholar), evaluation of the in vitro neutralization activity of the 3BNC117/10-1074 biNAb against an extended multiclade virus panel revealed a marginal increase in the neutralization breadth over 3BNC117 and 10-1074 bNAbs (Figure 1G; Table S1). However, neutralization potency was markedly reduced when compared to the activity of the parental bNAbs (either alone or as a mix, calculated based on the lowest IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) titer of the two bNAbs for a given virus). For the majority of the viruses tested, the observed IC50 titers of the biNAb were the average from the two parental bNAbs (Table S1). To determine whether the observed reduction in the neutralization potency was related to the epitope specificity of the selected bNAbs, we extended our study by focusing on different regions of Env, including the V1/2 epitope (targeted by the PG16 bNAb; Walker et al., 2009Walker L.M.

Druz A. et al.Broad and potent HIV-1 neutralization by a human antibody that binds the gp41-gp120 interface.Nature. 2014; 515: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Similar to the 3BNC117/10-1074 combination, V1/2-V3 biNAbs (PG16/10-1074, PG16/PGT121, and PG16/PGT128), as well as the gp120/41 interface biNAb, PGT151/35O22, exhibited compromised neutralization potency and none of the combinations achieved the activity of their respective parental bNAbs (Figures 2A–2D; Tables S2, S3, S4, and S5). These findings clearly suggest that biNAbs, regardless of their epitope specificities, fail to recapitulate the neutralization activity of their respective parental bNAbs, offering no advantages over conventional, monospecific bNAbs. A key immune evasion mechanism of HIV-1 against host antibody responses is the remarkably low density of Env molecules on the viral surface (Zhu et al., 2006Zhu P. Liu J. Bess Jr., J. Chertova E. Lifson J.D. Grisé H. Ofek G.A. Taylor K.A. Roux K.H. Distribution and three-dimensional structure of AIDS virus envelope spikes.Nature. 2006; 441: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), as well as the unique Env trimeric architecture, which precludes high-avidity bivalent interactions of IgG (Klein and Bjorkman, 2010Klein J.S. Bjorkman P.J. Few and far between: how HIV may be evading antibody avidity.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000908Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, likely that the tested biNAbs would exhibit predominantly monovalent binding to their respective epitopes, possibly accounting for the lack of synergistic activity. Indeed, given the relative rigidity and the short length of the hinge domain of IgG1, concurrent binding of the two Fab arms within the same Env trimer is largely restricted. Overcoming this limitation and favoring intra-trimeric, bivalent interactions of biNAbs should augment their neutralization activity through enhanced avidity (Galimidi et al., 2015Galimidi R.P.

https://openalex.org/W2441886327,"Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria derive their energy for growth from the oxidation of ammonium with nitrite as the electron acceptor. N2, the end product of this metabolism, is produced from the oxidation of the intermediate, hydrazine (N2H4). Previously, we identified N2-producing hydrazine dehydrogenase (KsHDH) from the anammox organism Kuenenia stuttgartiensis as the gene product of kustc0694 and determined some of its catalytic properties. In the genome of K. stuttgartiensis, kustc0694 is one of 10 paralogs related to octaheme hydroxylamine (NH2OH) oxidoreductase (HAO). Here, we characterized KsHDH as a covalently cross-linked homotrimeric octaheme protein as found for HAO and HAO-related hydroxylamine-oxidizing enzyme kustc1061 from K. stuttgartiensis. Interestingly, the HDH trimers formed octamers in solution, each octamer harboring an amazing 192 c-type heme moieties. Whereas HAO and kustc1061 are capable of hydrazine oxidation as well, KsHDH was highly specific for this activity. To understand this specificity, we performed detailed amino acid sequence analyses and investigated the catalytic and spectroscopic (electronic absorbance, EPR) properties of KsHDH in comparison with the well defined HAO and kustc1061. We conclude that HDH specificity is most likely derived from structural changes around the catalytic heme 4 (P460) and of the electron-wiring circuit comprising seven His/His-ligated c-type hemes in each subunit. These nuances make HDH a globally prominent N2-producing enzyme, next to nitrous oxide (N2O) reductase from denitrifying microorganisms."

Robust functional coupling of hPSC-derived neurons with target tissues in vitro is essential for modeling intercellular physiology in a dish and to further translational studies, but it has proven difficult to achieve. Here, we derive sympathetic neurons from hPSCs and show that they can form physical and functional connections with cardiac muscle cells. Using multiple hPSC reporter lines, we recapitulated human autonomic neuron development in vitro and successfully isolated PHOX2B::eGFP+ neurons that exhibit sympathetic marker expression and electrophysiological properties and norepinephrine secretion. Upon pharmacologic and optogenetic manipulation, PHOX2B::eGFP+ neurons controlled beating rates of cardiomyocytes, and the physical interactions between these cells increased neuronal maturation. This study provides a foundation for human sympathetic neuron specification and for hPSC-based neuronal control of organs in a dish."

In Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), high-level visual information is represented in the form of low-level features. The semantic gap between the low-level features and the high-level image concepts is an open research problem. In this paper, we present a novel visual words integration of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF). The two local features representations are selected for image retrieval because SIFT is more robust to the change in scale and rotation, while SURF is robust to changes in illumination. The visual words integration of SIFT and SURF adds the robustness of both features to image retrieval. The qualitative and quantitative comparisons conducted on Corel-1000, Corel-1500, Corel-2000, Oliva and Torralba and Ground Truth image benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed visual words integration."

The placenta seems to play an essential role in this disease, probably due to factors involved in its formation and development. The present study aimed to investigate the association between placental lesions, cytokines and angiogenic factors in pregnant women with preeclampsia (PE). We evaluated 20 normotensive pregnant women, 40 with early-onset PE and 80 with late-onset PE. Placental samples were analyzed for histopathology, immunohistochemistry and determination of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), placental growth factor (PlGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fms-like tyrosine-kinase-1 (Flt-1) and endoglin (Eng) levels. Higher percentages of increased syncytial knots and increased perivillous fibrin deposits, and greater levels of TNF-α, TGF-β1and Flt-1 were detected in placentas from early-onset PE. Levels of IL-10, VEGF and PlGF were decreased in PE versus normotensive placentas. Both the TNF-α/IL-10 and sFlt-1/PlGF ratios were higher in placental homogenate of early-onset PE than late-onset PE and control groups. The more severe lesions and the imbalance between TNF-α/IL-10 and PlGF/sFlt-1 in placentas from early-onset PE allows differentiation of early and late-onset PE and suggests higher placental impairment in early-onset PE."
https://openalex.org/W2433699362,"Neurons are well suited for computations on millisecond timescales, but some neuronal circuits set behavioral states over long time periods, such as those involved in energy homeostasis. We found that multiple types of hypothalamic neurons, including those that oppositely regulate body weight, are specialized as near-perfect synaptic integrators that summate inputs over extended timescales. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are greatly prolonged, outlasting the neuronal membrane time-constant up to 10-fold. This is due to the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 (Scn9a), previously associated with pain-sensation but not synaptic integration. Scn9a deletion in AGRP, POMC, or paraventricular hypothalamic neurons reduced EPSP duration, synaptic integration, and altered body weight in mice. In vivo whole-cell recordings in the hypothalamus confirmed near-perfect synaptic integration. These experiments show that integration of synaptic inputs over time by Nav1.7 is critical for body weight regulation and reveal a mechanism for synaptic control of circuits regulating long term homeostatic functions."

https://openalex.org/W2434085078,"Accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) seems to be a common metabolic strategy adopted by many bacteria to cope with cold environments. This work aimed at evaluating and understanding the cryoprotective effect of PHB. At first a monomer of PHB, 3-hydroxybutyrate, was identified as a potent cryoprotectant capable of protecting model enzyme (lipase), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacterial cells (Cupriavidus necator) against the adverse effects of freezing-thawing cycles. Further, the viability of the frozen-thawed PHB accumulating strain of C. necator was compared to that of the PHB non-accumulating mutant. The presence of PHB granules in cells was revealed to be a significant advantage during freezing. This might be attributed to the higher intracellular level of 3-hydroxybutyrate in PHB accumulating cells (due to the action of parallel PHB synthesis and degradation, the so-called PHB cycle), but the cryoprotective effect of PHB granules seems to be more complex. Since intracellular PHB granules retain highly flexible properties even at extremely low temperatures (observed by cryo-SEM), it can be expected that PHB granules protect cells against injury from extracellular ice. Finally, thermal analysis indicates that PHB-containing cells exhibit a higher rate of transmembrane water transport, which protects cells against the formation of intracellular ice which usually has fatal consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2434862009,"Fungal infections, especially those caused by antibiotic resistant pathogens, have become a serious public health problem due to the growing number of immunocompromised patients, including those subjected to anticancer treatment or suffering from HIV infection. In this study we assessed fungicidal activity of the ceragenins CSA-13, CSA-131 and CSA-192 against four fluconazole–resistant Candida strains. We found that ceragenins activity against planktonic Candida cells was higher than activity of human LL-37 peptide and synthetic cationic peptide omiganan. Compared to LL-37 peptide, ceragenins in the presence of DNase I demonstrated an increased ability to kill DNA-induced Candida biofilm. Microscopy studies show that treatment with LL-37 or ceragenins causes Candida cells to undergo extensive surface changes indicating surface membrane damage. This conclusion was substantiated by observation of rapid incorporation of FITC-labeled CSA-13, CSA-131 or LL-37 peptide into the more lipophilic environment of the Candida membrane. In addition to activity against Candida spp., ceragenins CSA-131 and CSA-192 display strong fungicidal activity against sixteen clinical isolates including Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. These results indicate the potential of ceragenins for future development as new fungicidal agents."
https://openalex.org/W2437321033,"Few effective therapeutic options are available for treating severe infections caused by extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDR-AB). Using a murine thigh-infection model, we examined the in vivo efficacy of colistin in combination with meropenem, tigecycline, fosfomycin, fusidic acid, rifampin, or sulbactam against 12 XDR-AB strains. Colistin, tigecycline, rifampin, and sulbactam monotherapy significantly decreased bacterial counts in murine thigh infections compared with those observed in control mice receiving no treatment. Colistin was the most effective agent tested, displaying bactericidal activity against 91.7% of strains at 48 h post-treatment. With strains showing a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for meropenem (MIC ≤ 32 mg/L), combination therapy with colistin plus meropenem caused synergistic inhibition at both 24 h and 48 h post-treatment. However, when the meropenem MIC was ≥64 mg/L, meropenem did not significantly alter the efficacy of colistin. The addition of rifampin and fusidic acid significantly improved the efficacy of colistin, showing a synergistic effect in 100% and 58.3% of strains after 24 h of treatment, respectively, while the addition of tigecycline, fosfomycin, or sulbactam did not show obvious synergistic activity. No clear differences in activities were observed between colistin-rifampin and colistin-fusidic acid combination therapy with most strains. Overall, our in vivo study showed that administering colistin in combination with rifampin or fusidic acid is more efficacious in treating XDR-AB infections than other combinations. The colistin-meropenem combination may be another appropriate option if the MIC is ≤32 mg/L. Further clinical studies are urgently needed to confirm the relevance of these findings."

Deleterious mutations have been reported to occur throughout the CDKL5 coding region. Several studies point to a complex CDKL5 gene structure in terms of exon usage and transcript expression. Improvements in molecular diagnosis and more extensive research into the neurobiology of CDKL5 and pathophysiology of CDKL5 disorders necessitate an updated analysis of the gene. In this study, we have analysed human and mouse CDKL5 transcript patterns both bioinformatically and experimentally. We have characterised the predominant brain isoform of CDKL5, a 9.7 kb transcript comprised of 18 exons with a large 6.6 kb 3'-untranslated region (UTR), which we name hCDKL5_1. In addition we describe new exonic regions and a range of novel splice and UTR isoforms. This has enabled the description of an updated gene model in both species and a standardised nomenclature system for CDKL5 transcripts. Profiling revealed tissue- and brain development stage-specific differences in expression between transcript isoforms. These findings provide an essential backdrop for the diagnosis of CDKL5-related disorders, for investigations into the basic biology of this gene and its protein products, and for the rational design of gene-based and molecular therapies for these disorders."

In particular, all definitions of segregation are implicitely tied to a single indicator, usually rely on an ambiguous definition of income classes, without any consensus on how to define neighbourhoods and to deal with the polycentric organization of large cities. In this paper, we address all these questions within a unique conceptual framework. We avoid the challenge of providing a direct definition of segregation and instead start from a definition of what segregation is not. This naturally leads to the measure of representation that is able to identify locations where categories are over- or underrepresented. From there, we provide a new measure of exposure that discriminates between situations where categories co-locate or repel one another. We then use this feature to provide an unambiguous, parameter-free method to find meaningful breaks in the income distribution, thus defining classes. Applied to the 2014 American Community Survey, we find 3 emerging classes -- low, middle and higher income -- out of the original 16 income categories. The higher-income households are proportionally more present in larger cities, while lower-income households are not, invalidating the idea of an increased social polarisation. Finally, using the density -- and not the distance to a center which is meaningless in polycentric cities -- we find that the richer class is overrepresented in high density zones, especially for larger cities. This suggests that density is a relevant factor for understanding the income structure of cities and might explain some of the differences observed between US and European cities."

To address this, we carried out a descriptive and retrospective pilot study, with a focus on the epidemiology of RSV in Senegal after 4 years of surveillance.From January 2012 to October 2015 swabs were collected from consenting ILI outpatients. Viral detection was performed using RV16 kit enabling direct subtyping of RSV-A and B. For the molecular characterization of HRSV, the second hypervariable region of the Glycoprotein (G) gene was targeted for sequencing. We enrolled 5338 patients with 2803 children younger than five years of age (52.5%). 610 (11.4%) were positive for RSV infection: 276 (45.2%) were group A infections, 334 (54.8%) were group B infections and 21 (3.4%) were A/B co-infections. RSV detection rate is significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in children below 5 years. We noted that the annual distribution of RSV varied substantially by season and for the predominant subtype. Globally, results show a clear circulation pattern in the second half of each year; between June and September and possibly extended into November. The majority of RSV-A strains from Senegal clustered with strains that were previously assigned NA1 and novel ON1 genotype sequences. RSV-B sequences from Senegal clustered with the BA9 genotype. At the amino acid level, RSV-A strains from Senegal show proximity with the genotype ON1 characterized by a 72 nt insertion in G, resulting in 24 extra amino acids of which 23 are duplications of aa 261-283.Globally our results show a clear circulation pattern of RSV in the second half of each year, between June and September and possibly extending into November, with children under 5 being more susceptible. Molecular studies identified the novel strains ON1 and BA9 as the major genotypes circulating in Senegal between 2012 and 2015."
https://openalex.org/W2463255141,"The cancer cells can acquire migration and invasion capacities during the metastasis process through the developmental regulatory program epithelial–mesenchymal-transition (EMT), and through its reverse process mesenchymal–epithelial transition cancer cells can recolonize at distant metastatic sites. Among the multifaceted effects exerted by this program, reorganization of actin cytoskeleton is the key mechanical drive for the invasive properties gained by cancer cells. Collapsin response mediator protein-1 (CRMP1) is a cytosolic phosphoprotein and originally characterized as the mediator of semaphorin 3A signaling involved in axon differentiation during neural development. Here we report that CRMP1 can act as a suppressor of tumorigenicity and metastasis in prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated that CRMP1 exhibited a decreased expression pattern in high-grade prostate cancer tissues and many prostate cancer cell lines, and its downregulation in cancer cells was attributed to histone deacetylation and direct repression of its gene by the EMT regulator Snail. Functional analyses revealed that CRMP1 suppressed EMT in prostate cancer cells, as its knockdown could trigger EMT and enhance in vitro invasion capacity, whereas its overexpression could inhibit EMT and suppress both in vitro invasion and in vivo metastasis capacities of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, CRMP1 overexpression could significantly confer resistance to EMT induced by Snail or transforming growth factor-β1 in prostatic epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that CRMP1 could associate with actin and WAVE1, an activator of actin nucleation complex Arp2/3, and also its knockdown could stabilize F-actin and trigger the formation of stress fibers in prostate cancer cells. Together, our study shows that CRMP1 acts an EMT and metastasis suppressor in prostate cancer cells via its regulation of actin polymerization and also suggests that targeting the CRMP1-actin signaling in actin organization could be a potential strategy for management of prostate cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2434412871,"Cartilage injury and degenerative tissue progression remain poorly understood by the medical community. Therefore, various tissue engineering strategies aim to recover areas of damaged cartilage by using non-traditional approaches. To this end, the use of biomimetic scaffolds for recreating the complex in vivo cartilage microenvironment has become of increasing interest in the field. In the present study, we report the development of two novel biomaterials for cartilage tissue engineering (CTE) with bioactive motifs, aiming to emulate the native cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). We employed a simple mixture of the self-assembling peptide RAD16-I with either Chondroitin Sulfate (CS) or Decorin molecules, taking advantage of the versatility of RAD16-I. After evaluating the structural stability of the bi-component scaffolds at a physiological pH, we characterized these materials using two different in vitro assessments: re-differentiation of human articular chondrocytes (AC) and induction of human adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) to a chondrogenic commitment. Interestingly, differences in cellular morphology and viability were observed between cell types and culture conditions (control and chondrogenic). In addition, both cell types underwent a chondrogenic commitment under inductive media conditions, and this did not occur under control conditions. Remarkably, the synthesis of important ECM constituents of mature cartilage, such as type II collagen and proteoglycans, was confirmed by gene and protein expression analyses and toluidine blue staining. Furthermore, the viscoelastic behavior of ADSC constructs after 4 weeks of culture was more similar to that of native articular cartilage than to that of AC constructs. Altogether, this comparative study between two cell types demonstrates the versatility of our novel biomaterials and suggests a potential 3D culture system suitable for promoting chondrogenic differentiation."

Cx50D47A does not traffic properly, and homozygous mutant lenses show increased levels of the stress-responsive αB-crystallins. Therefore, we assessed whether expression of Cx50D47A led to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the lens in vivo. Although pharmacologic induction of ER stress can be transduced by three different pathways, we found no evidence for activation of the IRE1α or ATF6 pathways in Cx50D47A-expressing lenses. In contrast, heterozygous and homozygous Cx50D47A lenses showed an increase in phosphorylated PERK immunoreactivity and in the ratio of phosphorylated to total EIF2α (2.4- and 3.3-fold, respectively) compared with wild type.

These observations suggest that expression of a Cx50D47 mutant may cause ER stress in the lens and contribute to pathology in this organ. The current understanding of cellular responses to ER stress is based on many studies in cultured cells and fewer studies in vivo. Although massive induction of ER stress by pharmacological agents may activate all three transducing pathways, the UPR is a regulated pathway that may differentially use the transducing pathways, depending on the stimulus causing the ER stress. To elucidate the effects of in vivo expression of a connexin with impaired trafficking, we studied the Cx50D47A mouse and examined the activation of each of the ER stress-transducing signaling pathways in the lens. We found evidence for activation of the PERK-dependent pathway, but not of the IRE1α- or ATF6-dependent pathways, in Cx50D47A-expressing lenses. Activation of the IRE1α pathway leads to splicing of its downstream target, Xbp-1 (X-box-binding protein 1) RNA. To test whether this ER stress-transducing pathway was activated in Cx50D47A-expressing lenses, we determined the relative levels of spliced Xbp-1 transcripts on the lens by RT-qPCR. Although variations in the levels of spliced Xbp-1 transcripts were detected among individuals (even within each genotype), they correlated with proportional changes in mRNA levels for total Xbp-1. Indeed, the spliced/total ratios of Xbp-1 transcripts in samples from heterozygous and homozygous animals were similar to those in wild type mice (Fig. 1), suggesting that this pathway is not activated by expression of Cx50D47A. As a positive control, a wild type lens was treated with thapsigargin, a non-competitive inhibitor of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase (SERCA), which induces the UPR pharmacologically. The spliced/total ratio of Xbp-1 transcripts in this sample was 3.8 (Fig. 1). ER stress-induced activation of the ATF6 pathway leads to translocation of ATF6α from the ER to the Golgi compartment, where it is cleaved by SP1 and SP2 (8Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Davé U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. ER stress induces cleavage of membrane-bound ATF6 by the same proteases that process SREBPs.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar), resulting in a change in apparent molecular mass from 90 to 50 kDa (9Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mammalian transcription factor ATF6 is synthesized as a transmembrane protein and activated by proteolysis in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). To test whether expression of Cx50D47A led to activation of the ATF6-dependent transducing pathway, whole lens homogenates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-ATF6α antibodies. Although the antibody recognizes both the full-length and cleaved forms of ATF6α, only the cleaved form was detected in lens samples (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, levels of cleaved ATF6α were significantly decreased in both heterozygous and homozygous Cx50D47A mice, respectively, representing on average 37.6 and 6.8% of the values detected in wild type littermates (Fig. 2), suggesting deactivation of this pathway in the mutant mice. Activation of the PERK-dependent signaling pathway involves PERK autophosphorylation. To test whether Cx50D47A led to activation of this pathway, we performed immunofluorescence on lens sections using an antibody that specifically detects the active (phosphorylated) form of PERK (P-PERK). Most of the P-PERK immunoreactivity appeared as small puncta located in epithelial and fiber cells near the bow region (Fig. 3, A–F). A significant increase in immunoreactive P-PERK was detected in sections from heterozygous and homozygous Cx50D47A mice as compared with wild type animals (Fig. 3G), but the increase did not reach statistical significance between heterozygous and homozygous lenses. Because activation of PERK leads to phosphorylation of EIF2α, we performed immunoblots to determine whether it occurred in Cx50D47A-expressing lenses. Heterozygous lenses showed a significant 1.4-fold increase in the relative ratio of phosphorylated to total EIF2α (P-EIF2α/EIF2α) above the ratio in wild type lenses, and homozygous lenses showed a significant 2.3-fold increase over the wild type ratio (Fig. 3H). Because phosphorylation of EIF2α may lead to increased translation of ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4 (CREB2)), we determined its levels in the lens. Levels of ATF4 were significantly increased in lenses from homozygous Cx50D47A mice, representing on average 391% of the levels detected in wild type mice, whereas levels of ATF4 in heterozygous lenses were similar to those of wild type animals (Fig. 3I). To test whether expression of Cx50D47A altered transcription or levels of ER proteins, we performed RT-qPCR and immunoblotting. Protein levels of the calcium-binding chaperone, calreticulin, which is mainly localized in the ER, were significantly increased in Cx50D47A-expressing lenses; they represented on average 184% in heterozygous and 262% in homozygous lenses of the calreticulin levels in wild type littermates (Fig. 4A). Levels of GRP78 (also known as BIP) were significantly increased in heterozygous and homozygous lenses (146 and 164%, respectively) relative to the levels in wild type lenses (Fig. 4B). The mRNA levels for two other ER-resident proteins that are often increased in the UPR, p58IPK (a co-chaperone of heat shock 70-kDa protein 8) and Erp72 (a protein-disulfide isomerase), were similar among all genotypes (Fig. 4, C and D). In the canonical ER stress response, increased transcription of CHOP is downstream from ATF4. To test whether the increased levels of ATF4 resulted in alterations in CHOP, we determined its transcript and protein levels. We detected significant increases of Chop mRNA in heterozygous and homozygous lenses (1.9- and 12.4-fold on average, respectively) compared with the levels detected in wild type lenses (Fig. 5A). A CHOP-immunoreactive band was clearly visible in immunoblots of samples from Cx50D47A homozygous mice, but this band was only barely detectable in heterozygous and wild type samples, implying that overall levels of the CHOP protein are extremely low in the normal lens (Fig. 5B). Levels of CHOP in homozygotes represented on average 384% of wild type levels (p < 0.05), whereas CHOP levels in heterozygotes were on average 73% of wild type levels (p = 0.3). To determine the cellular compartment of CHOP localization, we performed immunofluorescence. Immunoreactive CHOP staining was localized to nuclei of cells in the epithelium and bow region of all genotypes and in wild type lenses treated with thapsigargin in vitro to induce UPR (Fig. 5, C–T). Lenses from wild type (Fig. 5, C, F, and I) or Cx50D47A homozygous (Fig. 5, E, H, and K) mice showed much weaker CHOP immunoreactivity than wild type lenses treated with thapsigargin (Fig. 5, D, G, and J), suggesting that the endogenous ER stress induced by expression of Cx50D47A is milder than an abrupt pharmacologically induced ER stress. Because increased CHOP can lead to apoptosis, we performed TUNEL staining on lens sections. In 1-month-old wild type lenses, fluorescent puncta were detected within a few cells at the border of the organelle-free zone (where they often co-localized with DAPI-stained material probably representing cells undergoing denucleation, which is part of the normal process of fiber cell differentiation), as expected from previous studies of normal lenses (10Bassnett S. Mataic D. Chromatin degradation in differentiating fiber cells of the eye lens.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Less frequently, fluorescent puncta (that did not co-localize with DAPI-stained material) were detected in cells within the organelle-free zone (Fig. 6, A–C, J, and K). In contrast, within homozygous Cx50D47A lens sections, many TUNEL-stained puncta were detected that co-localized with some nuclei and many nuclear remnants (i.e. DAPI-stained material of smaller size and different morphology than the intact nuclei in epithelia and early differentiating fiber cells), most of which localized toward the center of the lens (Fig. 6, G–I). Sections from Cx50D47A heterozygous lenses also showed an increase in TUNEL-stained puncta compared with wild type lenses but less than that seen in homozygotes (Fig. 6, D–F). Examination of these samples at higher magnification revealed low intensity TUNEL-fluorescent puncta in the epithelia and differentiating fiber cells from Cx50D47A heterozygous and homozygous lenses that were seldom detected in wild type lenses (Fig. 6, J–O). Quantitative analyses of integrated density revealed a significant increase in TUNEL staining in heterozygous and homozygous samples compared with wild type (Fig. 6Q). When considered as ratios, the integrated densities of TUNEL staining were 19.6 times (heterozygotes) and 371 times (homozygotes) that of the wild type. These results presented a conundrum. Activation of the PERK-dependent UPR pathway (with increase in ATF4 and CHOP levels) in Cx50D47A homozygotes should have resulted in severe apoptosis and cell death. However, not all lens cells showed signs of DNA fragmentation after TUNEL staining. This prompted us to look for factors that might increase cell survival. Transcripts for Trib3 (Tribbles pseudokinase 3) and Irs2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) have been identified as pro-survival genes in early stage erythroblasts (which lose their nuclei during differentiation like lens cells) (11Sathyanarayana P. Dev A. Fang J. Houde E. Bogacheva O. Bogachev O. Menon M. Browne S. Pradeep A. Emerson C. Wojchowski D.M. EPO receptor circuits for primary erythroblast survival.Blood. 2008; 111: 5390-5399Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To test whether expression of Cx50D47A increased levels of Trib3 and Irs2 transcripts, we performed RT-qPCR. Levels of both Trib3 and Irs2 were significantly increased in Cx50D47A homozygotes, whereas the values in heterozygotes were similar to those in wild type animals (Fig. 7, A and B). The increase was, on average, 1.3-fold in heterozygotes and 7.3-fold in homozygotes for Irs2 and 1.5- and 1000-fold for Trib3. Because Trib3 transcription is a direct target of CHOP, and TRIB3 inhibits the transcriptional activity of ATF4 and CHOP, we used immunoblotting to determine whether the levels of TRIB3 were increased. A TRIB3-immunoreactive band was detected in samples from Cx50D47A homozygous lenses, whereas TRIB3 was almost undetectable in samples from wild type and Cx50D47A heterozygous lenses (Fig. 7C). On average, levels of TRIB3 protein represented 83% (heterozygotes) and 881% (homozygotes) of the values in wild type lenses (Fig. 7C). Cx50D47A does not traffic properly and is retained intracellularly, mostly in the endoplasmic reticulum (1Arora A. Minogue P.J. Liu X. Addison P.K. Russel-Eggitt I. Webster A.R. Hunt D.M. Ebihara L. Beyer E.C. Berthoud V.M. Moore A.T. A novel connexin50 mutation associated with congenital nuclear pulverulent cataracts.J. Med. Genet. 2008; 45: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that expression of this mutant induced ER stress in the lenses of both heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice. The induced ER stress was transduced through the PERK-dependent pathway. The extent of activation of this pathway was more pronounced in homozygotes than in heterozygotes. We did not detect activation of the other two signal transduction pathways; the degree of activation of the Ire1α pathway was unchanged, whereas the ATF6 pathway was significantly decreased. A common characteristic of ER stress is the expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum. Such an expansion may be responsible for the 84 and 162% increases in calreticulin levels in heterozygous and homozygous Cx50D47A lenses. This may result from an increase in the capacity of the ER per cell or from an increase in the number of lens cells containing ER, because Cx50D47A lenses have organelle-containing cells reaching farther into the organ than do wild type lenses (3Berthoud V.M. Minogue P.J. Yu H. Schroeder R. Snabb J.I. Beyer E.C. Connexin50D47A decreases levels of fiber cell connexins and impairs lens fiber cell differentiation.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2013; 54: 7614-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The expansion did not increase all ER-resident proteins to the same extent. GRP78 levels increased by about 50% in both heterozygous and homozygous lenses. Protein-disulfide isomerase increased by about 13% in heterozygous and 21% in homozygous lenses (3Berthoud V.M. Minogue P.J. Yu H. Schroeder R. Snabb J.I. Beyer E.C. Connexin50D47A decreases levels of fiber cell connexins and impairs lens fiber cell differentiation.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2013; 54: 7614-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, the transcript levels for other ER-resident proteins (i.e. p58IPK and ERP72) were unchanged. These results imply that expression of Cx50D47A caused expansion of the ER with selective changes among ER-resident proteins, as has been observed after induction of ER stress in other cell types (12Klooster R.

Cell Res. 2010; 316: 2113-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The canonical ER stress-induced PERK signaling pathway is characterized by elevated phosphorylation of PERK, which increases phosphorylation of EIF2α. Phosphorylation of EIF2α results in inhibition of general protein translation (14Hershey J.W.B. Translational control in mammalian cells.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and selective translation of ER chaperones and the transcription factor ATF4. ATF4 in turn increases transcription of several proteins, including the transcription factor CHOP (Fig. 8). In Cx50D47A mice, P-PERK immunostaining in heterozygous and homozygous lenses was significantly higher than in wild type lenses, suggesting activation of this ER stress signaling pathway. Although the increase in P-PERK immunostaining did not reach statistical significance between Cx50D47A heterozygotes and homozygotes, downstream targets exhibited differences suggesting that their activation was greater in homozygotes. Heterozygous Cx50D47A lenses showed smaller increases of the P-EIF2α/EIF2α ratio and of Chop transcripts than homozygous Cx50D47A lenses and showed no increases of CHOP or ATF4 protein levels. Homozygous Cx50D47A lenses showed a significant increase in ATF4 levels associated with increases in Chop transcript and protein, suggesting activation of a UPR. These changes probably occurred in organelle-containing fiber cells that reach deeper into the lens in Cx50D47A mice (3Berthoud V.M. Minogue P.J. Yu H. Schroeder R. Snabb J.I. Beyer E.C. Connexin50D47A decreases levels of fiber cell connexins and impairs lens fiber cell differentiation.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2013; 54: 7614-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Persistent activation of PERK signaling (as occurs in Cx50D47A lenses) has been associated with impaired cell proliferation and a global decrease in protein synthesis (15Lin J.H. Li H. Zhang Y. Ron D. Walter P. Divergent effects of PERK and IRE1 signaling on cell viability.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Decreased cell proliferation and inhibition of general protein synthesis probably contribute to the decrease in lens size observed in heterozygous and homozygous Cx50D47A mice (3Berthoud V.M. Minogue P.J. Yu H. Schroeder R. Snabb J.I. Beyer E.C. Connexin50D47A decreases levels of fiber cell connexins and impairs lens fiber cell differentiation.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2013; 54: 7614-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The decrease in general protein translation may partially explain the severe reductions (>80%) in Cx50 levels in these mutant mice, but it cannot fully explain the decrease, because levels of other proteins (including Cx46) did not decrease to the same extent (3Berthoud V.M. Minogue P.J. Yu H. Schroeder R. Snabb J.I. Beyer E.C. Connexin50D47A decreases levels of fiber cell connexins and impairs lens fiber cell differentiation.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2013; 54: 7614-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Levels of selected proteins might be reduced by degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system or autophagy; ER stress or the UPR can interface with these pathways to preserve proteostasis (16Rashid H.-O. Yadav R.K. Kim H.-R. Chae H.-J. ER stress: autophagy induction, inhibition and selection.Autophagy. 2015; 11: 1956-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Thus, both inhibition of general protein synthesis and activation of selective protein degradation may contribute to the incomplete differentiation of fiber cells in Cx50D47A mice. Similarly, incomplete differentiation was observed in C2C12 myoblasts overexpressing the spliced form of Xbp1, since they did not generate mature myotubes when induced to differentiate (17Acosta-Alvear D. Zhou Y. Blais A. Tsikitis M. Lents N.H. Arias C. Lennon C.J. Kluger Y. Dynlacht B.D. XBP1 controls diverse cell type- and condition-specific transcriptional regulatory networks.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 53-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Elevated PERK signaling can increase either cell survival or apoptosis, depending on the differential activation of downstream targets (15Lin J.H. Li H. Zhang Y. Ron D. Walter P. Divergent effects of PERK and IRE1 signaling on cell viability.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 18Hamanaka R.B. Bobrovnikova-Marjon E. Ji X. Liebhaber S.A. Diehl J.A. PERK-dependent regulation of IAP translation during ER stress.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Homozygous Cx50D47A lenses showed aspects of both kinds of responses. They exhibited increases in Chop transcripts and CHOP protein, which are most commonly associated with apoptosis. TUNEL staining (which detects DNA strand breaks) was increased and was most evident toward the center of the lens. Some epithelial or differentiating fiber cells may have undergone apoptosis, contributing to the smaller lens size. However, homozygous Cx50D47A lenses also showed increased levels of Trib3 and Irs2 transcripts, both of which have been identified as pro-survival factors in early stage erythroblasts when erythropoietin is limiting (11Sathyanarayana P. Dev A. Fang J. Houde E. Bogacheva O. Bogachev O. Menon M. Browne S. Pradeep A. Emerson C. Wojchowski D.M. EPO receptor circuits for primary erythroblast survival.Blood. 2008; 111: 5390-5399Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Trib3 is a downstream target of CHOP and can inhibit the transcriptional activities of ATF4 and CHOP (19Jousse C. Deval C. Maurin A.-C. Parry L. Chérasse Y. Chaveroux C. Lefloch R. Lenormand P. Bruhat A. Fafournoux P. TRB3 inhibits the transcriptional activation of stress-regulated genes by a negative feedback on the ATF4 pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15851-15861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. TRB3, a novel ER stress-inducible gene, is induced via ATF4-CHOP pathway and is involved in cell death.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). TRIB3 has been ascribed pro-apoptotic effects in other systems. Thus, it may act as a switch between survival and apoptosis, with its pro- or anti-apoptotic function depending on cell type, context, and extent of activation. The ability of TRIB3 to regulate its own expression by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of ATF4 suggests that the fates of different cells may depend on the levels of TRIB3 protein attained in each cell. In the lens, TRIB3 (in combination with IRS2) may have acted as a pro-survival factor, because these lenses are already compromised due to the decrease in connexin levels, which would limit intercellular transfer of nutrients and signaling molecules to the center of the lens. Thus, the activities of IRS2 and TRIB3 acting as pro-survival factors may explain the lack of massive TUNEL staining in differentiating fibers (as would be expected from the increase in CHOP) and the absence of remarkable findings in hematoxylin- and eosin-stained Cx50D47A lens sections (2Steele Jr., E.C. Lyon M.F. Favor J. Guillot P.V. Boyd Y. Church R.L. A mutation in the connexin 50 (Cx50) gene is a candidate for the No2 mouse cataract.Curr. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ATF4 has previously been implicated in lens cell survival, because lenses from ATF4 knock-out mice undergo apoptotic cell death and ultimately degenerate (21Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Sugihara A. Maekawa A. Terada N. Yoshida N. Akira S. Targeted disruption of ATF4 discloses its essential role in the formation of eye lens fibres.Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, the consistent increase in ATF4 levels that we observed in 1-month-old homozygous Cx50D47A lenses may correspond to a compensatory change to avoid apoptotic cell death. Our results obtained from Cx50D47A mice suggest that other connexin mutants may also contribute to pathology through ER stress and the UPR. Lenses of 2-month-old mice heterozygous for Cx50G22R or Cx50S50P contain increased levels of spliced Xbp-1 transcripts (without corresponding changes in protein), suggesting that the IRE1α-dependent pathway may be activated (22Alapure B.V. Stull J.K. Firtina Z. Duncan M.K. The unfolded protein response is activated in connexin 50 mutant mouse lenses.Exp. Eye Res. 2012; 102: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, these results contrast with our observations that the IRE1α-dependent pathway was not activated in Cx50D47A lenses; rather, the PERK-dependent pathway was stimulated. This implies that the ER stress induced by diverse Cx50 mutants may be transduced through different signaling pathways. ER stress-induced cell death through activation of the UPR has been reported for mammalian cells transfected with skin disease-linked Cx31 mutants (23Tattersall D. Scott C.A. Gray C. Zicha D. Kelsell D.P. EKV mutant connexin 31 associated cell death is mediated by ER stress.Hum. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2440245111,"We investigated the transcriptomic response of a new strain of the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus, in glucose and xylose media using RNA-seq. The data were explored in a number of innovative ways using a variety of networks types, pathway maps, enrichment statistics, reporter metabolites and a flux simulation model, revealing different aspects of the genome-scale response in an integrative systems biology manner. The importance of the subcellular localisation in the transcriptomic response is emphasised here, revealing new insights. As was previously reported by others using a rich medium, we show that peroxisomal fatty acid catabolism was dramatically up-regulated in a defined xylose mineral medium without fatty acids, along with mechanisms to activate fatty acids and transfer products of β-oxidation to the mitochondria. Notably, we observed a strong up-regulation of the 2-methylcitrate pathway, supporting capacity for odd-chain fatty acid catabolism. Next we asked which pathways would respond to the additional requirement for NADPH for xylose utilisation, and rationalised the unexpected results using simulations with Flux Balance Analysis. On a fundamental level, we investigated the contribution of the hierarchical and metabolic regulation levels to the regulation of metabolic fluxes. Metabolic regulation analysis suggested that genetic level regulation plays a major role in regulating metabolic fluxes in adaptation to xylose, even for the high capacity reactions, which is unexpected. In addition, isozyme switching may play an important role in re-routing of metabolic fluxes in subcellular compartments in K. marxianus."
https://openalex.org/W2439650346,"Selective transport of pyruvate across the inner mitochondrial membrane by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is a fundamental step that couples cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism. The recent molecular identification of the MPC complex has revealed two interacting subunits, MPC1 and MPC2. Although in yeast, an additional subunit, MPC3, can functionally replace MPC2, no alternative MPC subunits have been described in higher eukaryotes. Here, we report for the first time the existence of a novel MPC subunit termed MPC1-like (MPC1L), which is present uniquely in placental mammals. MPC1L shares high sequence, structural, and topological homology with MPC1. In addition, we provide several lines of evidence to show that MPC1L is functionally equivalent to MPC1: 1) when co-expressed with MPC2, it rescues pyruvate import in a MPC-deleted yeast strain; 2) in mammalian cells, it can associate with MPC2 to form a functional carrier as assessed by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; 3) in MPC1 depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MPC1L rescues the loss of pyruvate-driven respiration and stabilizes MPC2 expression; and 4) MPC1- and MPC1L-mediated pyruvate imports show similar efficiency. However, we show that MPC1L has a highly specific expression pattern and is localized almost exclusively in testis and more specifically in postmeiotic spermatids and sperm cells. This is in marked contrast to MPC1/MPC2, which are ubiquitously expressed throughout the organism. To date, the biological importance of this alternative MPC complex during spermatogenesis in placental mammals remains unknown. Nevertheless, these findings open up new avenues for investigating the structure-function relationship within the MPC complex."

The ultimate goal was to obtain more insight into ranavirus disease emergence and ecological risk. In total 155 dead amphibians from 52 sites were submitted between 2011 and 2014, and examined using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, virus isolation and molecular genetic characterization. Ranavirus-associated amphibian mortality events occurred at 18 sites (35%), initially only in proximity of the 2010 index site. Specimens belonging to approximately half of the native amphibian species were infected, including the threatened Pelobates fuscus (spadefoot toad). Clustered massive outbreaks involving dead adult specimens and ranavirus genomic identity indicated that one common midwife toad virus (CMTV)-like ranavirus strain is emerging in provinces in the north of the Netherlands. Modelling based on the spatiotemporal pattern of spread showed a high probability that this emerging virus will continue to be detected at new sites (the discrete reproductive power of this outbreak is 0.35). Phylogenetically distinct CMTV-like ranaviruses were found in the south of the Netherlands more recently. In addition to showing that CMTV-like ranaviruses threaten wild amphibian populations not only in Spain but also in the Netherlands, the current spread and risk of establishment reiterate that understanding the underlying causes of CMTV-like ranavirus emergence requires international attention."

In-vivo therapeutic efficacy assessment of CQ (1500 mg over three days) plus PQ (210 mg over 14 days) regimen was carried out in accordance with the World Health Organization's protocol of 28 days follow-up among microscopically diagnosed monoinfection P. vivax cohort.In total, 161 participants were recruited in the study of which, 155 (96.3%) participants completed till day 28 follow-up, fully complied with the treatment regimen and showed adequate clinical and parasitological response. Loss to follow up was noted with 5 (3.1%) participants and non-compliance with treatment regimen occurred with one participant (0.6%). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd, <30% of normal mean activity) was noted among 5 (3.1%) participants and one of them did develop PQ induced dark-brown urination which subsided after PQ discontinuation. G6PDd patients were treated with PQ 45 mg/week for eight weeks while PQ was discontinued in one case with G6PD 1.4 U/g Hb due to complaint of reddish-brown coloured urine by 48 hours of PQ initiation. Nested polymerase chain reaction test revealed 45 (28%) cases as mixed (vivax and falciparum) malaria.The CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective to treat uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Udupi taluk and thus it should continue as first line regimen. For all P. vivax cases, G6PD screening before PQ administration must be mandatory and made available in all PHCs."
https://openalex.org/W2439494677,"Poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) is a copolymer of lactic and glycolic acid. Drug release from PLGA microspheres depends not only on polymer properties but also on drug type, particle size, morphology of microspheres, release conditions, etc. Selecting a subset of relevant properties for PLGA is a challenging machine learning task as there are over three hundred features to consider. In this work, we formulate the selection of critical attributes for PLGA as a multiobjective optimization problem with the aim of minimizing the error of predicting the dissolution profile while reducing the number of attributes selected. Four bio-inspired optimization algorithms: antlion optimization, binary version of antlion optimization, grey wolf optimization, and social spider optimization are used to select the optimal feature set for predicting the dissolution profile of PLGA. Besides these, LASSO algorithm is also used for comparisons. Selection of crucial variables is performed under the assumption that both predictability and model simplicity are of equal importance to the final result. During the feature selection process, a set of input variables is employed to find minimum generalization error across different predictive models and their settings/architectures. The methodology is evaluated using predictive modeling for which various tools are chosen, such as Cubist, random forests, artificial neural networks (monotonic MLP, deep learning MLP), multivariate adaptive regression splines, classification and regression tree, and hybrid systems of fuzzy logic and evolutionary computations (fugeR). The experimental results are compared with the results reported by Szlȩk.

https://openalex.org/W2426100093,"Bacteria live primarily in microbial communities (biofilms), where they exhibit considerably higher biocide tolerance than their planktonic counterparts. Current standardized efficacy testing protocols of disinfectants, however, employ predominantly planktonic bacteria. In order to test the efficacy of biocides on biofilms in a standardized manner, a new assay was developed and optimized for easy-handling, quickness, low running costs, and above all-repeatability. In this assay, 5 mm glass- or polytetrafluoroethylene beads in 24 well microtiter plates served as substrate for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. After optimizing result-relevant steps, the actual performance of the assay was explored by treating P. aeruginosa biofilms with glutaraldehyde, isopropanol, or peracetic acid in predefined concentrations. The aspired 5 log10 reduction in CFU counts was achieved by glutaraldehyde at 5% (30 min), and by peracetic acid at 0.3% (10 min). In contrast, 80% isopropanol (30 min) failed to meet the reduction goal. However, the main accomplishment of this study was to unveil the potential of the array itself; most noteworthy here, a reliable repeatability of the results. The new bead assay for biofilms is a robust, quick and cost-effective method for assessing the efficacy of biocides against biofilms."
https://openalex.org/W2425692864,"Prions or PrPSc are proteinaceous infectious agents that consist of misfolded, self-replicating states of the prion protein or PrPC. PrPC is posttranslationally modified with N-linked glycans and a sialylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Conformational conversion of PrPC gives rise to glycosylated and GPI-anchored PrPSc. The question of the sialylation status of GPIs within PrPSc has been controversial. Previous studies that examined scrapie brains reported that both sialo- and asialo-GPIs were present in PrPSc, with the majority being asialo-GPIs. In contrast, recent work that employed cultured cells claimed that only PrPC with sialylo-GPIs could be recruited into PrPSc, whereas PrPC with asialo-GPIs inhibited conversion. To resolve this controversy, we analyzed the sialylation status of GPIs within PrPSc generated in the brain, spleen, or cultured N2a or C2C12 myotube cells. We found that recruiting PrPC with both sialo- and asialo-GPIs is a common feature of PrPSc. The mixtures of sialo- and asialo-GPIs were observed in PrPSc universally regardless of prion strain as well as host, tissue, or type of cells that produced PrPSc. Remarkably, the proportion of sialo- versus asialo-GPIs was found to be controlled by host, tissue, and cell type but not prion strain. In summary, this study found no strain-specific preferences for selecting PrPC with sialo- versus asialo-GPIs. Instead, this work suggests that the sialylation status of GPIs within PrPSc is regulated in a cell-, tissue-, or host-specific manner and is likely to be determined by the specifics of GPI biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2435522877,"LRP1 (LDL receptor-related protein-1) is a ubiquitous receptor with both cell signaling and ligand endocytosis properties. In the liver, LRP1 serves as a chylomicron remnant receptor and also participates in the transport of extracellular cathepsin D to the lysosome for prosaposin activation. The current study showed that in comparison with wild type mice, hepatocyte-specific LRP1 knock-out (hLrp1−/−) mice were more susceptible to fasting-induced lipid accumulation in the liver. Primary hepatocytes isolated from hLrp1−/− mice also accumulated more intracellular lipids and experienced higher levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after palmitate treatment compared with similarly treated hLrp1+/+ hepatocytes. Palmitate-treated hLrp1−/− hepatocytes displayed similar LC3-II levels, but the levels of p62 were elevated in comparison with palmitate-treated hLrp1+/+ hepatocytes, suggesting that the elevated lipid accumulation in LRP1-defective hepatocytes was not due to defects in autophagosome formation but was due to impairment of lipophagic lipid hydrolysis in the lysosome. Additional studies showed increased palmitate-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial and lysosomal permeability, and cell death in hLrp1−/− hepatocytes. Importantly, the elevated cell death and ER stress observed in hLrp1−/− hepatocytes were abrogated by E64D treatment, whereas inhibiting ER stress diminished cell death but not lysosomal permeabilization. Taken together, these results documented that LRP1 deficiency in hepatocytes promotes lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity through lysosomal-mitochondrial permeabilization and ER stress that ultimately result in cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2462677535,"Elucidating the mechanisms involved in sensitizing radioresistant tumors to ionizing radiation (IR) treatments while minimizing injury to surrounding normal tissue is an important clinical goal. Due to their sequence-derived specificity and properties as gene regulators in IR-affected pathways, microRNAs (miRNAs) could serve as adjuvant therapeutic agents that alter cellular sensitivity to radiation treatment. To identify radiosensitizing miRNAs, we initially utilized the Caenorhabditis elegans vulval cell model, an in vivo system developed to study IR-dependent radiosensitivity as a measure of clonogenic cell death. We tested several candidate miRNA-deletion mutants post γ-irradiation and identified cel-mir-237 as a miRNA which when deleted caused animals to be more resistant to IR, whereas cel-mir-237 overexpressing strains were IR sensitive. In addition, wild-type animals downregulated cel-mir-237 levels post IR in a time-dependent manner. We identified jun-1 (JUN transcription factor homolog) as a novel target of cel-mir-237. Specifically, jun-1 transcript levels increased in wild-type animals post γ-irradiation, and loss of cel-mir-237 also resulted in higher jun-1 expression. As expected, loss of jun-1 resulted in IR sensitivity, similar to the phenotype of cel-mir-237 overexpressors. As miR-237 is the homolog of human miR-125, we validated our findings in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, which harbor lower hsa-miR-125b levels than normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). Forced expression of hsa-miR-125b in these cells resulted in radiosensitivity, as seen by reduced clonogenic survival, enhanced apoptotic activity and enhanced senescence post IR. Finally, re-expression of c-JUN in MDA-MB-231 cells promoted radioresistance and abrogated miR-125-mediated radiosensitization. Our findings suggest that overexpression of cel-mir-237 and its homolog, hsa-miR-125b, functions as sensitizers to γ-irradiation in both a nematode in vivo model and breast cancer cells, and could potentially be utilized as an adjuvant therapeutic to enhance radiation sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2433760646,"Testes of most male mammals present the particularity of being externalized from the body and are consequently slightly cooler than core body temperature (4–8°C below). Although, hypothermia of the testis is known to increase germ cells apoptosis, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms, including cold sensors, transduction pathways, and apoptosis triggers. In this study, using a functional knockout mouse model of the cold and menthol receptors, dubbed transient receptor potential melastatine 8 (TRPM8) channels, we found that TRPM8 initiated the cold-shock response by differentially modulating cold-and heat-shock proteins. Besides, apoptosis of germ cells increased in proportion to the cooling level in control mice but was independent of temperature in knockout mice. We also observed that the rate of germ cell death correlated positively with the reactive oxygen species level and negatively with the expression of the detoxifying enzymes. This result suggests that the TRPM8 sensor is a key determinant of germ cell fate under hypothermic stimulation.—Borowiec, A.-S., Sion, B., Chalmel, F., Rolland, A.D., Lemonnier, L., De Clerck, T., Bokhobza, A., Derouiche, S., Dewailly, E., Slomianny, C., Mauduit, C., Benahmed, M., Roudbaraki, M., Jégou, B., Prevarskaya, N., Bidaux, G.

Changes in immune cells were observed in the blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and spleen, as well as lymph nodes associated with the site of infection or distant from the respiratory system. Nevertheless clinical symptoms were mild, with circulating leukocytes exhibiting rapid, dynamic, and profound changes in response to infection.

Two days after infection, when infected ferrets showed peak fever, a marked, transient lymphopenia and granulocytosis were apparent in all infected animals. Both draining and distal lymph nodes demonstrated significant accumulation of T cells, B cells, and granulocytes at days 2 and 5 post-infection. CD8+ T cells significantly increased in spleen at days 2 and 5 post-infection; CD4+ T cells, B cells and granulocytes significantly increased at day 5. We interpret our findings as showing that lymphocytes exit the peripheral blood and differentially home to lymph nodes and tissues based on cell type and proximity to the site of infection.

Furthermore, the present study proved that YL104H could also co-utilize xylose and glucose for succinate production. However, anaerobic succinate accumulation using xylose as the sole carbon source failed, probably because of an insufficient supply of energy. By analyzing the ATP generation under anaerobic conditions in the presence of glucose or xylose, we indicated that succinate production was affected by the intracellular ATP level, which can be simply regulated by the substrate ratio of xylose to glucose. This finding was confirmed by succinate production using an artificial mixture containing different xylose to glucose ratios. Using xylose mother liquor, a waste containing both glucose and xylose derived from xylitol production, a final succinate titer of 61.66 g/L with an overall productivity of 0.95 g/L/h was achieved, indicating that the regulation of the intracellular ATP level may be a useful and efficient strategy for succinate production and can be extended to other anaerobic processes."

Sumoylation occurs in the nucleus and requires DNA binding by Ikaros. Sumoylated Ikaros is less effective than unsumoylated forms at inhibiting the expansion of murine leukemic cells, and Ikaros sumoylation is abundant in human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemic cells, but not in healthy peripheral blood leukocytes.

Patients with large cyst-plus-globe volume had higher MCR of orbital volume (p = 0.002), height (p = 0.014), width (p = 0.005) and depth (p = 0.002) and less displacement in inferior (p = 0.004) orbital rim, compared with patients with small cyst-plus-globe volume, but the differences between patients with small cyst-plus-globe volume and patients without cyst were not significant.Microphthalmic eyes with large cyst-plus-globe volume showed better similarity with the contralateral eyes, comparing with microphthalmic eyes without orbital cyst or with small cyst-plus-globe volume. It suggested that the existence of orbital cysts (especially large cysts) in microphthalmic eyes might play a positive role in the orbital development."
https://openalex.org/W2437562817,"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is highly immunogenic and able to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, its ability to induce adverse effects has held back the use of VSV as a potential vaccine vector. In this study we developed VSV-ΔP, a safe yet potent replication-defective recombinant VSV in which the phosphoprotein (P) gene was deleted. VSV-ΔP replicated only in supporting cells expressing P (BHK-P cells) and at levels more than 2 logs lower than VSV. In vivo studies indicated that the moderate replication of VSV-ΔP in vitro was associated with the attenuation of this virus in the mouse model, whereas mice intracranially injected with VSV succumbed to neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we constructed VSV and VSV-ΔP expressing a variety of antigens including hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) from Newcastle disease virus (NDV), hemagglutinin (HA) from either a 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pdm/09) or the avian H7N9. VSV and VSV-ΔP incorporated the foreign antigens on their surface resulting in induction of robust neutralizing antibody, serum IgG, and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers against their corresponding viruses. These results indicated that VSV with P gene deletion was attenuated in vitro and in vivo, and possibly expressed the foreign antigen on its surface. Therefore, the P gene-deletion strategy may offer a potentially useful and safer approach for attenuating negative-sense RNA viruses which use phosphoprotein as a cofactor for viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W2426091661,"Seven human-specific Alu markers were studied in 574 unrelated individuals from 10 endogamous groups and 2 hill tribes of Tamil Nadu and Kerala states. DNA was isolated, amplified by PCR-SSP, and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and genotypes were assigned for various Alu loci. Average heterozygosity among caste populations was in the range of 0.292-0.468. Among tribes, the average heterozygosity was higher for Paliyan (0.3759) than for Kani (0.2915). Frequency differences were prominent in all loci studied except Alu CD4. For Alu CD4, the frequency was 0.0363 in Yadavas, a traditional pastoral and herd maintaining population, and 0.2439 in Narikuravars, a nomadic gypsy population. The overall genetic difference (Gst) of 12 populations (castes and tribes) studied was 3.6%, which corresponds to the Gst values of 3.6% recorded earlier for Western Asian populations. Thus, our study confirms the genetic similarities between West Asian populations and South Indian castes and tribes and supported the large scale coastal migrations from Africa into India through West Asia. However, the average genetic difference (Gst) of Kani and Paliyan tribes with other South Indian tribes studied earlier was 8.3%. The average Gst of combined South and North Indian Tribes (CSNIT) was 9.5%. Neighbor joining tree constructed showed close proximity of Kani and Paliyan tribal groups to the other two South Indian tribes, Toda and Irula of Nilgiri hills studied earlier. Further, the analysis revealed the affinities among populations and confirmed the presence of North and South India specific lineages. Our findings have documented the highly diverse (micro differentiated) nature of South Indian tribes, predominantly due to isolation, than the endogamous population groups of South India. Thus, our study firmly established the genetic relationship of South Indian castes and tribes and supported the proposed large scale ancestral migrations from Africa, particularly into South India through West Asian corridor."
https://openalex.org/W2420017019,"For many graduate students, the academic path may not be the best fit, and with limited faculty positions available, many students are now looking to other career possibilities. University programs are helping students to explore and pursue alternative careers. For many graduate students, the academic path may not be the best fit, and with limited faculty positions available, many students are now looking to other career possibilities. University programs are helping students to explore and pursue alternative careers. About halfway through her PhD program at Johns Hopkins University, Diedre Ribbens started thinking that running a lab might not be what she envisioned for her future. Was this just the typical third-year-of-grad-school experience of feeling trapped in an endless tunnel? Or was it a signal that a non-academic path might be a better fit for her? Fortunately, Ribbens had the opportunity to attend a number of career panels at Hopkins, where she was able to explore other options. At one of these, a speaker introduced her to the idea of science writing, and she became intrigued. Her research advisor, Peter Espenshade, made it a point to conduct an annual review with his trainees to discuss their accomplishments, research trajectory, and future goals, so Ribbens used this time to open a discussion about her interest in science writing. With his approval, she started looking for opportunities to write press releases, newsletters, and blog posts during her final years in graduate school, including for the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB), and successfully launched a career in science writing when she graduated in 2013. “I think I was one of the first students who graduated from Peter’s lab and didn’t go on to a postdoc,” Ribbens reflects. “It was uncharted territory for him and me, so we were learning together.” For his part, Espenshade says, Ribbens was the first trainee he’d met who had that passion for a non-academic career. “I became a better listener and started thinking that those are just the people saying something—what about people who aren’t saying anything at all?” he says. “I took a real interest and wanted to do something about it.” At the same time, both nationally and at Hopkins, the conversation was bubbling around preparing students in the life sciences for careers outside of the academic pipeline, given the limited number of faculty positions relative to the number of students. With funding from the Provost’s Office at Hopkins, Espenshade helped develop and launch a program called the Biomedical Careers Initiative (BCI) on the campus in 2014. Under the university’s Professional Development and Career Office, BCI now helps to expose trainees to other professional career paths and skills training. The program holds networking events and facilitates internships with partner companies or societies in a variety of fields, including administration, policy, consulting, and science writing. “Some people still think it’s a distraction, but as faculty we’ve all had students who would benefit from something like this. When faculty are faced with a student sitting across the table from them who will benefit from these programs, they realize this is a good opportunity,” says Espenshade. Hopkins is far from the only institution to kick-start hands-on career exploration programs like this. The conversation around training science students and postdocs for a wider range of careers is growing, whether their interests lie in education, equity research, policy, industry, tech transfer, or any number of other options. Many of these training or exploration programs start at the grassroots level with students who form clubs or cohorts around a common career interest. At the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern, a student-run committee called Quest for Careers (QFC) brings in speakers once a month to represent different career paths for PhD scientists. Svetlana Pitts, the current president of QFC and a PhD candidate in neuroscience, oversees the seminars, many of which are presented by members of the alumni network. Generally, each member of QFC’s committee gets a chance to suggest and host a speaker. “I think this is the easiest way to explore your career options,” says Pitts. “You don’t have to make contact with people yourself, which can be very scary in the beginning. You go to a talk, get to hear about the career, and if you want to know more you can approach the speaker or email us to ask for more contact information. It’s providing people a chance to learn.” Similar programs at other institutions have been running for more than a decade. The Training Initiatives in Biomedical and Biological Sciences (TIBBS) program at the University of North Carolina, for instance, began in 2006 as a career development program for the life sciences students. In its early days, the TIBBS office organized career panels and workshops with scientists working in different fields. “They were basically trying to respond to the needs of the trainees at the time,” says Patrick Brandt, the university’s director of career development and training. With steady budget increases each year, TIBBS was able to increase its offerings in 2008, when Brandt joined the office as a postdoc. The team started a “career blitz,” an afternoon in which two dozen scientists who took different career paths meet with students for informational interviews, as well as a bootcamp to help students consider how a postdoctoral fellowship might advance their career goals. As TIBBS developed, more trainees volunteered their time to help organize and coordinate the program. “I think it was hugely ahead of the game,” says Pat Phelps, the first director of TIBBS and now director of the Professional Development and Career Office at Hopkins, where she works in tandem with Espenshade to create career programming. A major impetus for other institutions to develop career exploration programs has been the NIH Broadening Experience in Scientific Training (BEST) grants, which awarded 5 years of funding to 17 universities between 2013 and 2014 to help prepare trainees for careers outside of conventional academic research. The BEST grant program, funded out of the NIH Common Fund, is one of the most visible organized efforts to inform PhD scientists about varied career options. “The NIH is stating that these career paths are important to the nation, to the biomedical research community,” says Trish Labosky, program leader in the NIH’s Office of Strategic Communication. “It gives the programs a certain level of gravitas.” The BEST programs are themselves research oriented and are carrying out experiments with quantifiable results, with the aim of identifying what approaches are most effective for broadening career development. Grantee institutions survey students to measure their awareness of different careers and their perceived agency to approach a career path or decision, as well as the time it takes graduates to reach desired career outcomes. Program administrators also engage faculty to assess their needs and participation. “The goal is culture change amongst the trainees, faculty, and administration, such that the activities the grantees develop will be measured and the ones that work will be maintained and be valuable,” says Labosky. The BEST grants have allowed some universities to go beyond career seminars and networking events. At the University of North Carolina, the TIBBS program expanded with a BEST grant in 2014, and the most significant changes that took place as a result of receiving the award were hiring additional staff and partnering with local companies to create internship programs and short-term job shadow opportunities. The augmented program, called the Immersion Program to Advance Career Training (ImPACT), also helps students develop individual training plans, allows staff and trainees to attend six- to eight-session skills workshops, and supports student-run “career cohorts,” which provide career-specific support in a peer-to-peer format, invite speakers to campus to talk about career options in their chosen area, and participate in opportunities to enhance their career-related skill sets. With the explosion of career exploration programs spurred by the BEST grants, many universities do face the challenge of gaining support among faculty for new initiatives—especially when those programs might take students or postdocs out of the lab for months at a time on internships. In departmental meetings, some nascent initiatives have raised support by presenting survey data from alumni and current trainees that illustrate the reality of their wide career interests. “Say you’re at a university where only 10 percent of your PhD students go onto faculty positions—you can’t only be training students for that,” Espenshade emphasizes. “In academia, people are most easily convinced by data.” Similarly, other program directors have found that students return from internships with more focus and enthusiasm for their research, and sharing those stories with hesitant faculty can be quite persuasive. Paperwork requiring an advisor’s signature at multiple stages often helps keep the principal investigators involved in the discussion all along and encourages trainees to start these conversations early. Another challenge that many career exploration programs face is getting students through their doors in the first place. At Hopkins, the Professional Development and Career Office offers multiple in-depth programs—among them, a short-term externship with investment firms T. Rowe Price and Stifel to expose trainees to equity research and a newly launched program with AstraZeneca’s R&D branch MedImmune that allows graduate students to conduct thesis research in biopharma—in addition to the opportunities already offered through the BCI program. However, Phelps laments the occasional low event attendance rates among Hopkins trainees. “One of the hardest things we face in offices like my own is getting the word out to students. We have all of these amazing programs that they can take advantage of, but we might only get 5 percent of the population to attend,” Phelps says. “There’s so much going on at any institution, and unless it’s required, they might not hear about it, or they might not be comfortable leaving the lab to attend.” Cynthia Fuhrmann, director of the BEST-funded Center for Biomedical Career Development at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, came at this problem with her team by focusing the bulk of their efforts on a required career development curriculum tailored for graduate students and postdocs as part of a broader culture change. “We were thinking about what we could launch that would be sustainable and make a real difference for all students, not just those likely to take their own action,” says Fuhrmann. “There seemed to be a strong recurring theme: trainees wished they’d begun thinking about their careers earlier.” Fuhrmann echoes Phelps’s comment about student participation and points out that students are busy—there are dozens of reasons why trainees who could benefit still might not come to a voluntary workshop or seminar, which are also offered to supplement the UMass program. So all students in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at the UMass Medical School now create an individual development plan, starting in their third year, which requires them to think about where they want to head long-term and how to use their time and training to advance toward those goals. “We wanted to develop a culture on our campus of talking openly about career interests and taking career-oriented steps early in training,” says Fuhrmann. “We boiled it down to a required curriculum, built into our graduate training program, to support the professional development of all students—whether they want to pursue careers in academia or in any other sector.” Once trainees start thinking seriously about what career they may want to pursue, getting them into positions where they can learn and hone new skills is a resource-intensive process, as many universities developing internship programs can testify. At the University of Chicago’s BEST-funded initiative myCHOICE (Chicago Options in Career Empowerment), the program team has created on-campus internships to cut down on the price tag. These internal internships, in areas including clinical trial coordination, communications, grants development, and marketing, can be done part-time and are close to the lab to avoid removing students or postdocs from their research. The trainees are also encouraged to take an internship near the end of their time at the university, when the bulk of their research is completed. “The gratitude that we’ve gotten from students and postdocs has made it all worth it,” says Erin Adams, one of the principal investigators for the myCHOICE program. “We’ve had people stop us on the quad and say, ‘Thank you so much for developing this program. It’s really opened our eyes, and we feel like we’re being valued by the university and that people care about what we do.’ I didn’t expect to get that feedback.” For the University of Chicago and other institutions with BEST funding, all face the question of what happens after the NIH funding period concludes. This hurdle comes in multiple forms depending on how the institution has used the grant money—for some, the main challenge is securing internal support to keep staff directors on board. Others are working out financial partnerships with companies or societies that have hosted interns, and still more are reaching out to their alumni and donors to gather continued support philanthropically. Some program elements may simply be cut if they prove unsustainable in the end. These and myriad other institutions are finding new ways to train graduate students and postdocs for the full range of careers in the life sciences. Many programs start by raising career awareness, asking trainees to think seriously about what they want to do after completing their education, and then move to networking through panels, seminars, and workshops with professionals in those fields. Hands-on experience may come in the form of a 3-month internship with a company or society halfway across the country, a short-term job shadowing day, or a part-time program writing press releases for the campus communications office. However, the common thread is a desire to help trainees arrive in a career path that allows them to use their experience in a fulfilling manner. A few years ago, Ribbens returned to Hopkins for a thesis seminar and spoke with a woman who’d been interested in science writing and was a year behind her in school—right in time to reap the benefits of the newly launched BCI program. “She was telling me all about the internship she had at ASBMB, working for my editor,” Ribbens remembers. As a graduate who fought to forge her own career path and struggled with feelings of isolation, Ribbens says, “I thought, ‘That is so cool, that they have the resources to make that opportunity available.’ I would have loved to have something like that. It really allows you to go a lot further a lot faster in a non-academic setting.”"

https://openalex.org/W2433827586,"Existing tools for evaluating psychosocial interventions (un-validated self-reporting questionnaires) are not ideal for use in non-Western conflict settings. We implement a generic method of treatment evaluation, using client and counsellor feedback, in 18 projects in non-Western humanitarian settings. We discuss our findings from the perspective of validity and suggestions for future research. A retrospective analysis is executed using data gathered from psychosocial projects. Clients (n = 7,058) complete two (complaints and functioning) rating scales each session and counsellors rate the client’s status at exit. The client-completed pre- and post-intervention rating scales show substantial changes. Counsellor evaluation of the clients’ status shows a similar trend in improvement. All three multivariable models for each separate scale have similar associations between the scales and the investigated variables despite different cultural settings. The validity is good. Limitations are: ratings give only a general impression and clinical risk factors are not measured. Potential ceiling effects may influence change of scales. The intra and inter-rater reliability of the counsellors’ rating is not assessed. The focus on client and counsellor perspectives to evaluate treatment outcome seems a strong alternative for evaluation instruments frequently used in psychosocial programming. The session client rated scales helps client and counsellor to set mutual treatment objectives and reduce drop-out risk. Further research should test the scales against a cross-cultural valid gold standard to obtain insight into their clinical relevance."

Monochromatic images at 70keV were reconstructed with the following 4 ASIR percentages: 0%, 30%, 50%, and 70%. The image noise (IN) (standard deviation, SD) of portal vein (PV), the contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR), and the subjective score for the sharpness of PV boundaries, and the diagnostic acceptability (DA) were obtained. The IN, CNR, and the subjective scores were compared among the four ASIR groups.The IN (in HU) of PV (10.05±3.14, 9.23±3.05, 8.44±2.95 and 7.83±2.90) decreased and CNR values of PV (8.04±3.32, 8.95±3.63, 9.80±4.12 and 10.74±4.73) increased with the increase in ASIR percentage (0%, 30%, 50%, and 70%, respectively), and were statistically different for the 4 ASIR groups (p<0.05). The subjective scores showed that the sharpness of portal vein boundaries (3.13±0.59, 2.82±0.44, 2.73±0.54 and 2.07±0.54) decreased with higher ASIR percentages (p<0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2442375358,"Slow deactivation of Kv11.1 channels is critical for its function in the heart. The S4-S5 linker, which joins the voltage sensor and pore domains, plays a critical role in this slow deactivation gating. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to identify the membrane-bound surface of the S4S5 linker, and we show that two highly conserved tyrosine residues within the KCNH subfamily of channels are membrane-associated. Site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological analysis indicates that Tyr-542 interacts with both the pore domain and voltage sensor residues to stabilize activated conformations of the channel, whereas Tyr-545 contributes to the slow kinetics of deactivation by primarily stabilizing the transition state between the activated and closed states. Thus, the two tyrosine residues in the Kv11.1 S4S5 linker play critical but distinct roles in the slow deactivation phenotype, which is a hallmark of Kv11.1 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2431315565,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) control strategies are focused mainly on prevention, early diagnosis, compliance to treatment and contact tracing. The objectives of this study were to explore the frequency and risk factors of recent transmission of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in Cantabria in Northern Spain from 2012 through 2013 and to analyze their clonal complexity for better understanding of the transmission dynamics in a moderate TB incidence setting. Methods DNA from 85 out of 87 isolates from bacteriologically confirmed cases of MTBC infection were extracted directly from frozen stocks and genotyped using the mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) method. The MIRU-VNTRplus database tool was used to identify clusters and lineages and to build a neighbor joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree. In addition, data were compared to the SITVIT2 database at the Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe. Results The rate of recent transmission was calculated to 24%. Clustering was associated with being Spanish-born. A high prevalence of isolates of the Euro-American lineage was found. In addition, MIRU-VNTR profiles of the studied isolates corresponded to previously found MIRU-VNTR types in other countries, including Spain, Belgium, Great Britain, USA, Croatia, South Africa and The Netherlands. Six of the strains analyzed represented clonal variants. Conclusion Transmission of MTBC is well controlled in Cantabria. The majority of TB patients were born in Spain. The population structure of MTBC in Cantabria has a low diversity of major clonal lineages with the Euro-American lineage predominating."
https://openalex.org/W2432651451,"This paper examines the application of a bootstrap test error estimation of radial basis functions, specifically thin-plate spline fitting, in surface smoothing. The presence of noisy data is a common issue of the point set model that is generated from 3D scanning devices, and hence, point set denoising is one of the main concerns in point set modelling. Bootstrap test error estimation, which is applied when searching for the smoothing parameters of radial basis functions, is revisited. The main contribution of this paper is a smoothing algorithm that relies on a bootstrap-based radial basis function. The proposed method incorporates a k-nearest neighbour search and then projects the point set to the approximated thin-plate spline surface. Therefore, the denoising process is achieved, and the features are well preserved. A comparison of the proposed method with other smoothing methods is also carried out in this study."
