https://openalex.org/W2090459898,"Implanting materials in the body to program host immune cells is a promising alternative to transplantation of cells manipulated ex vivo to direct an immune response, but doing so requires a surgical procedure. Here we demonstrate that high-aspect-ratio, mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) injected with a needle spontaneously assemble in vivo to form macroporous structures that provide a 3D cellular microenvironment for host immune cells. In mice, substantial numbers of dendritic cells are recruited to the pores between the scaffold rods. The recruitment of dendritic cells and their subsequent homing to lymph nodes can be modulated by sustained release of inflammatory signals and adjuvants from the scaffold. Moreover, injection of an MSR-based vaccine formulation enhances systemic helper T cells TH1 and TH2 serum antibody and cytotoxic T-cell levels compared to bolus controls. These findings suggest that injectable MSRs may serve as a multifunctional vaccine platform to modulate host immune cell function and provoke adaptive immune responses."

The MinION nanopore sequencer can produce long sequencing reads on a device similar in size to a USB memory stick. Here we apply a MinION sequencer to resolve the structure and chromosomal insertion site of a composite antibiotic resistance island in Salmonella Typhi Haplotype 58. Nanopore sequencing data from a single 18-h run was used to create a scaffold for an assembly generated from short-read Illumina data. Our results demonstrate the potential of the MinION device in clinical laboratories to fully characterize the epidemic spread of bacterial pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2086425717,"The antibody gene mutator activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) promiscuously damages oncogenes, leading to chromosomal translocations and tumorigenesis. Why nonimmunoglobulin loci are susceptible to AID activity is unknown. Here, we study AID-mediated lesions in the context of nuclear architecture and the B cell regulome. We show that AID targets are not randomly distributed across the genome but are predominantly grouped within super-enhancers and regulatory clusters. Unexpectedly, in these domains, AID deaminates active promoters and eRNA(+) enhancers interconnected in some instances over megabases of linear chromatin. Using genome editing, we demonstrate that 3D-linked targets cooperate to recruit AID-mediated breaks. Furthermore, a comparison of hypermutation in mouse B cells, AID-induced kataegis in human lymphomas, and translocations in MEFs reveals that AID damages different genes in different cell types. Yet, in all cases, the targets are predominantly associated with topological complex, highly transcribed super-enhancers, demonstrating that these compartments are key mediators of AID recruitment."

Though largely specific for immunoglobulin genes, AID also acts on a limited set of off-targets, generating oncogenic translocations and mutations that contribute to B cell lymphoma. How AID is recruited to off-targets has been a long-standing mystery. Based on deep GRO-seq studies of mouse and human B lineage cells activated for CSR or SHM, we report that most robust AID off-target translocations occur within highly focal regions of target genes in which sense and antisense transcription converge. Moreover, we found that such AID-targeting “convergent” transcription arises from antisense transcription that emanates from super-enhancers within sense transcribed gene bodies.

Our findings provide an explanation for AID off-targeting to a small subset of mostly lineage-specific genes in activated B cells. The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is comprised of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (IgH) and light (IgL) chains. In response to antigen activation, B lymphocytes in peripheral lymphoid organs undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) and IgH class switch recombination (CSR) and ultimately secrete their BCR as an antibody. SHM diversifies antibody repertoires by introducing high-frequency mutations into IgH and IgL variable region exons (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007Di Noia J.M. Neuberger M.S. Molecular mechanisms of antibody somatic hypermutation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). SHM occurs in germinal centers (GCs) of peripheral lymphoid tissues, where B cells are selected for mutations that generate BCRs with increased antigen affinity (Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012Victora G.D. Nussenzweig M.C. Germinal centers.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). IgH CSR involves generation and joining of IgH locus DSBs in switch (S) regions that precede various sets of IgH CH exons (CHs) to replace the initially expressed CH with a downstream CH, thereby producing antibodies with different effector functions (Matthews et al., 2014Matthews A.J. Zheng S. DiMenna L.J. Chaudhuri J. Regulation of immunoglobulin class-switch recombination: choreography of noncoding transcription, targeted DNA deamination, and long-range DNA repair.Adv. Immunol. 2014; 122: 1-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both SHM and CSR are initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) (Muramatsu et al., 2000Muramatsu M. Kinoshita K. Fagarasan S. Yamada S. Shinkai Y. Honjo T. Class switch recombination and hypermutation require activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a potential RNA editing enzyme.Cell. 2000; 102: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar), which deaminates cytosine to uridine on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007Di Noia J.M. Neuberger M.S. Molecular mechanisms of antibody somatic hypermutation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Mismatches created by these deaminated cytidines are processed into mutations or DSBs during SHM and CSR, respectively, through a process that employs activities of normal base excision or mismatch repair pathways (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007Di Noia J.M. Neuberger M.S. Molecular mechanisms of antibody somatic hypermutation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Within target sequences, AID cytidine deamination focuses on 3–4 bp “SHM” motifs that are greatly enriched in S regions and in portions of variable region exons that encode antigen-binding sites (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007Di Noia J.M. Neuberger M.S. Molecular mechanisms of antibody somatic hypermutation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Transcription is required for AID targeting during SHM and CSR (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W. Zhang Y. Meng F.L. Guo C. Schwer B.

Why does somatic hypermutation by AID require transcription of its target genes?.Adv. Immunol. 2014; 122: 253-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this regard, SHM of V(D)J exons in GC B cells begins ∼150 bp downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and tapers off 1–2 kb downstream (Liu and Schatz, 2009Liu M. Schatz D.G. Balancing AID and DNA repair during somatic hypermutation.Trends Immunol. 2009; 30: 173-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Likewise, each CH has a promoter upstream of the S region that upon induction by external signals generates transcription through the S region and, thereby, targets AID (Matthews et al., 2014Matthews A.J. Zheng S. DiMenna L.J. Chaudhuri J. Regulation of immunoglobulin class-switch recombination: choreography of noncoding transcription, targeted DNA deamination, and long-range DNA repair.Adv. Immunol. 2014; 122: 1-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mouse and human S regions also have a highly G-rich nontemplate strand that upon transcription forms stable R-loops that provide ssDNA to augment AID targeting (Matthews et al., 2014Matthews A.J. Zheng S. DiMenna L.J. Chaudhuri J. Regulation of immunoglobulin class-switch recombination: choreography of noncoding transcription, targeted DNA deamination, and long-range DNA repair.Adv.

Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase II (Pol II) has been implicated in directing AID to Ig gene SHM and CSR targets through a transcription coupled mechanism (Storb, 2014Storb U. Why does somatic hypermutation by AID require transcription of its target genes?.Adv. Immunol. 2014; 122: 253-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that involves AID association with the Spt5 transcription cofactor in the context of Pol II stalling (Pavri et al., 2010Pavri R. Gazumyan A. Jankovic M. Di Virgilio M. Klein I. Ansarah-Sobrinho C. Resch W. Yamane A. Reina San-Martin B. Barreto V. et al.Activation-induced cytidine deaminase targets DNA at sites of RNA polymerase II stalling by interaction with Spt5.Cell. 2010; 143: 122-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). R loops or other aspects of repetitive S region structure may augment AID access by promoting Pol II stalling (Rajagopal et al., 2009Rajagopal D. Maul R.W. Ghosh A. Chakraborty T. Khamlichi A.A. Sen R. Gearhart P.J. Immunoglobulin switch mu sequence causes RNA polymerase II accumulation and reduces dA hypermutation.J. Exp.

Once AID is recruited to Ig targets, replication protein A (RPA) and the RNA exosome RNA degradation complex contribute to generating requisite ssDNA substrates (Basu et al., 2011Basu U. Meng F.L.

Noncoding RNA transcription targets AID to divergently transcribed loci in B cells.Nature. 2014; 514: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Beyond Ig gene targets, AID initiates recurrent mutations or DSBs in a small subset of non-Ig genes collectively termed AID “off-target” genes (Pasqualucci et al., 2001Pasqualucci L. Neumeister P.

Two levels of protection for the B cell genome during somatic hypermutation.Nature. 2008; 451: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Off-target AID activity promotes translocations between Ig loci and cellular oncogenes, as well as SHMs of oncogenes associated with B cell lymphomas (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W. Zhang Y. Meng F.L.

Dalla-Favera R. Mechanisms of chromosomal translocations in B cell lymphomas.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5580-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Identification of AID off-targets has been facilitated by genome-wide translocation cloning methods (Chiarle et al., 2011Chiarle R. Zhang Y. Frock R.L. Lewis S.M. Molinie B. Ho Y.J. Myers D.R.

Duke J.L. Richter D.J. Vinuesa C.G. Goodnow C.C. Kleinstein S.H. Schatz D.G. Two levels of protection for the B cell genome during somatic hypermutation.Nature. 2008; 451: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, Yamane et al., 2011Yamane A. Resch W. Kuo N.

In general, AID activity occurs at much lower levels on off-targets than on Ig genes (Liu and Schatz, 2009Liu M. Schatz D.G.

AID off-target sequences are not enriched in AID hotspot motifs relative to the genome in general (Duke et al., 2013Duke J.L. Liu M. Yaari G. Khalil A.M. Tomayko M.M. Shlomchik M.J. Schatz D.G. Kleinstein S.H. Multiple transcription factor binding sites predict AID targeting in non-Ig genes.J. Immunol. 2013; 190: 3878-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for transcription, AID off-target activity is most abundant on transcribed genes downstream of their TSSs (Pasqualucci et al., 2001Pasqualucci L. Neumeister P. Goossens T. Nanjangud G. Chaganti R.S. Küppers R. Dalla-Favera R.

Robbiani D.F. et al.Translocation-capture sequencing reveals the extent and nature of chromosomal rearrangements in B lymphocytes.Cell. 2011; 147: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, transcription per se is not sufficient to target AID, as most transcribed genes are not AID off-targets (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W. Zhang Y. Meng F.L. Guo C. Schwer B. Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, Liu and Schatz, 2009Liu M. Schatz D.G. Balancing AID and DNA repair during somatic hypermutation.Trends Immunol. 2009; 30: 173-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Next-generation sequencing studies revealed unexpected transcriptional features, including divergent sense and antisense transcription at TSSs (Wu and Sharp, 2013Wu X. Sharp P.A. Divergent transcription: a driving force for new gene origination?.Cell. 2013; 155: 990-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Adelman and Lis, 2012Adelman K. Lis J.T. Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II: emerging roles in metazoans.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) and frequent promoter proximal Pol II pausing (Adelman and Lis, 2012Adelman K. Lis J.T. Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II: emerging roles in metazoans.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). But, divergent transcription (DivT) from TSSs occurs in over half of all genes and generally does not map directly to sites of AID off-target activity (Chiarle et al., 2011Chiarle R. Zhang Y. Frock R.L. Lewis S.M. Molinie B. Ho Y.J. Myers D.R. Choi V.W. Compagno M. Malkin D.J. et al.Genome-wide translocation sequencing reveals mechanisms of chromosome breaks and rearrangements in B cells.Cell. 2011; 147: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar; see below). Likewise, transcriptional pausing alone cannot explain AID off-targeting, because more than 30% of transcribed genes have paused Pol II (Adelman and Lis, 2012Adelman K. Lis J.T. Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II: emerging roles in metazoans.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Thus, mechanisms that lead to recurrent AID targeting may arise from previously unrecognized transcriptional or epigenetic determinants (Alt et al., 2013Alt F.W. Zhang Y. Meng F.L. Guo C. Schwer B. Mechanisms of programmed DNA lesions and genomic instability in the immune system.Cell. 2013; 152: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) detects nascent transcripts generated by transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases (Core et al., 2008Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals widespread pausing and divergent initiation at human promoters.Science. 2008; 322: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). GRO-seq revealed that a large fraction of intergenic regions are transcribed, with a subset emanating from transcriptional enhancers (Wang et al., 2011Wang D. Garcia-Bassets I. Benner C. Li W. Su X. Zhou Y. Qiu J. Liu W. Kaikkonen M.U. Ohgi K.A. et al.Reprogramming transcription by distinct classes of enhancers functionally defined by eRNA.Nature. 2011; 474: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Enhancers are sequence-defined, cis-regulatory elements that influence target gene expression irrespective of orientation (Levine et al., 2014Levine M. Cattoglio C. Tjian R. Looping back to leap forward: transcription enters a new era.Cell. 2014; 157: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Both enhancers within genes (intragenic) and intergenic enhancers may regulate target promoters locally and over long distances (Levine et al., 2014Levine M. Cattoglio C. Tjian R. Looping back to leap forward: transcription enters a new era.Cell. 2014; 157: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Active enhancer sequences are commonly transcribed by RNA Pol II generating so-called “enhancer RNAs” (eRNAs), and transcription arising from enhancers is often divergent, with both sense and antisense transcription emanating from enhancer elements (Natoli and Andrau, 2012Natoli G. Andrau J.C. Noncoding transcription at enhancers: general principles and functional models.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2012; 46: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2011Wang D. Garcia-Bassets I. Benner C. Li W. Su X. Zhou Y. Qiu J. Liu W. Kaikkonen M.U. Ohgi K.A. et al.Reprogramming transcription by distinct classes of enhancers functionally defined by eRNA.Nature. 2011; 474: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Various regulatory functions have been ascribed to eRNAs and other noncoding RNAs (Lam et al., 2014Lam M.T. Li W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Enhancer RNAs and regulated transcriptional programs.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2014; 39: 170-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), however, much of noncoding RNA biology is not fully understood. Enhancers are comprised of discrete or clustered transcription factor binding sequences. A common feature of active enhancers is chromatin that is characteristically modified by acetylation (e.g., histone 3 lysine 27; H3K27Ac) and methylation (e.g., histone 3 lysine 4 mono-methylation; H3K4me1) (Creyghton et al., 2010Creyghton M.P. Cheng A.W. Welstead G.G. Kooistra T. Carey B.W. Steine E.J. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Frampton G.M. Sharp P.A. et al.Histone H3K27ac separates active from poised enhancers and predicts developmental state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 21931-21936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). An unexpected asymmetry in the regional allocation of enhancer factors and enrichment for enhancer marks within and unique to each mammalian cell type studied revealed a subset of so-called super-enhancers (SEs) that feature clusters of hyperacetylated and actively transcribed enhancers that, on average, are 10-fold longer than other “typical” enhancers (Whyte et al., 2013Whyte W.A.

Like locus control regions, SEs regulate genes involved in specialized cellular function (Parker et al., 2013Parker S.C. Stitzel M.L. Taylor D.L. Orozco J.M. Erdos M.R. Akiyama J.A. van Bueren K.L.

Here, we report that the majority of detectable AID off-target activity in a variety of mouse and human lymphoid or nonlymphoid cell types occurs within focal regions of overlapping sense/antisense transcription within intragenic SEs. To elucidate transcriptional features that influence AID targeting genome-wide, we applied GRO-seq to splenic naive, GC, and CSR-activated B cells at much greater depth than done previously. Naive splenic B cells were purified (Figure S1A available online) and then cultured in the presence of αCD40 plus interleukin-4 (IL4) for 60 hr to stimulate AID induction and CSR to IgG1 and IgE (Figure S1A). Splenic GC B cells were purified from sheep red blood cell immunized mice (Figure S1A) and confirmed to be >90% pure (Figures S1B–S1D). Three independent GRO-seq biological replicates were performed for each cell type and gave highly reproducible results (Figure S1E). Transcription profiles of over 20,000 genes revealed distinct (but overlapping) gene expression patterns for each cell type that were further classified by gene ontology terms (Figure S1G; Table S1). As expected (Core et al., 2008Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T.

In-depth examination of sense transcription profiles of several “signature” genes illustrates the specificity of purified cell populations. For example, Aicda sense transcription reflects AID protein expression in the three cell types, with high levels in GC B cells and activated B cells; but none detectable in naive B cells (Figure 1). In contrast, several GC B cell-specific genes, including SLIP-GC (Richter et al., 2009Richter K. Brar S. Ray M. Pisitkun P. Bolland S. Verkoczy L. Diaz M. Speckled-like pattern in the germinal center (SLIP-GC), a nuclear GTPase expressed in activation-induced deaminase-expressing lymphomas and germinal center B cells.J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2044882055,"A major challenge in neuroscience is to determine the nanoscale position and quantity of signaling molecules in a cell type- and subcellular compartment-specific manner. We developed a new approach to this problem by combining cell-specific physiological and anatomical characterization with super-resolution imaging and studied the molecular and structural parameters shaping the physiological properties of synaptic endocannabinoid signaling in the mouse hippocampus. We found that axon terminals of perisomatically projecting GABAergic interneurons possessed increased CB1 receptor number, active-zone complexity and receptor/effector ratio compared with dendritically projecting interneurons, consistent with higher efficiency of cannabinoid signaling at somatic versus dendritic synapses. Furthermore, chronic Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol administration, which reduces cannabinoid efficacy on GABA release, evoked marked CB1 downregulation in a dose-dependent manner. Full receptor recovery required several weeks after the cessation of Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol treatment. These findings indicate that cell type-specific nanoscale analysis of endogenous protein distribution is possible in brain circuits and identify previously unknown molecular properties controlling endocannabinoid signaling and cannabis-induced cognitive dysfunction."

These achievements relied on advances in the resolution, density, and fidelity of neural signal recordings, emphasizing the pivotal role of neurotechnology for brain research and medical treatments. Most current neural recording devices transmit data via constraining cabled electronics. The ability to record neural data and maintain subject safety under tethered connections has limited experimental and clinical studies to static environments, restricting the range of possible brain science research and applications. Such tethered studies have produced pioneering results (Collinger et al., 2013Collinger J.L. Wodlinger B. Downey J.E. Wang W. Tyler-Kabara E.C. Weber D.J. McMorland A.J.C. Velliste M. Boninger M.L.

Each technical approach reached compromises between system complexity, power dissipation, data transmission performance, signal quality, battery capacity, and device size. Typically, small-size devices record neural data from a limited number of channels (Greenwald et al., 2011Greenwald E. Mollazadeh M. Hu C. Wei Tang Culurciello E. Thakor V. A VLSI neural monitoring system with ultra-wideband telemetry for awake behaving subjects.IEEE Trans Biomed Circuits Syst. 2011; 5: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or concede signal fidelity to increase the channel count (Schwarz et al., 2014Schwarz D.A. Lebedev M.A. Hanson T.L. Dimitrov D.F. Lehew G. Meloy J. Rajangam S. Subramanian V. Ifft P.J. Li Z. et al.Chronic, wireless recordings of large-scale brain activity in freely moving rhesus monkeys.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We previously presented an implantable subcutaneous wireless neurosensor that met the technical requirements of a hermetically sealed device for chronic short-range use in animal models (Borton et al., 2013bBorton D.A. Yin M. Aceros J. Nurmikko A. An implantable wireless neural interface for recording cortical circuit dynamics in moving primates.J. Neural Eng. 2013; 10: 026010Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). While fully implantable devices are necessary for chronic medical treatments, the majority of brain research experiments and many clinical applications are not contingent on fully implantable electronics, which involve high manufacturing costs and complexity. On the other hand, the neuroscience and clinical community would benefit greatly from the availability of a versatile and cost-efficient reusable device capable of transmitting large quantities of high-fidelity neural signals over extended periods of time in mobile and unconstrained subjects. Here we introduce such a wireless neurosensor and an adaptive multiantenna receiver as an integrated neurotechnology platform that enables full broadband recordings of large neuronal populations from subjects freely moving and behaving in natural environments. We acquired broadband neural recordings from nonhuman primates in previously inaccessible experimental conditions. The wireless neurosensor was connected to a silicon-based intracortical microelectrode array (Blackrock Microsystems), which allowed us to monitor motor cortex activity during natural locomotion and sleep-wake transitions. This microelectrode array is used in numerous laboratories around the world and a 510(k)-cleared version is currently employed in clinical studies (Collinger et al., 2013Collinger J.L. Wodlinger B. Downey J.E. Wang W. Tyler-Kabara E.C. Weber D.J. McMorland A.J.C. Velliste M. Boninger M.L. Schwartz A.B.

Reach and grasp by people with tetraplegia using a neurally controlled robotic arm.Nature. 2012; 485: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar) (e.g., http://BrainGate2.org). Importantly, we designed the wireless neurosensor to be compatible with arbitrary neural probes, including multisite depth electrodes and electrocorticography grid arrays that are currently used for medical diagnostics, therapeutic treatments, and fundamental brain science. We have designed, built, and deployed a miniaturized wireless high data rate neurosensor platform where a key element is an ultralow-power miniaturized head-mounted device (Figure 1). This device leverages earlier advances (Yin et al., 2013bYin M. Li H. Bull C. Borton D.A. Aceros J. Larson L. Nurmikko A.V. An externally head-mounted wireless neural recording device for laboratory animal research and possible human clinical use.Conf. Proc. IEEE Eng. Med. Biol. Soc. 2013; 2013: 3109-3114PubMed Google Scholar) and (1) integrates custom amplification microelectronic circuitry that amplifies and multiplexes 100 channels of broadband neural signals; (2) transmits data digitally at high sampling rates (20 kSps/ch) up to a 5 m distance via a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) wireless link for extended spatial coverage; and (3) operates on a single one-half AA Li-ion battery continuously for more than 48 hr. The neurosensor device weighs only 46.1 g and incorporates three ultralow-power, custom-designed ASICs for signal amplification, packaging, and transmission (Figures 1C and 1E). The assembled components are protected from mechanical and electrical impact by a static-dissipative, carbon-fiber-reinforced PolyEtherEtherKetone (PEEK, 52×44×30mm) enclosure (Figure 1A). The device utilizes a “screw-on” quick interconnect to the pedestal (Figure 1B). An outer lock-ring secures the system to the connector, which reduces the possibility of water ingression during operation. Small cavities embedded in the housing support Ethylene Oxide (EtO) sterilization, a standard for clinical sterilization. A key challenge for recording wireless neural data from mobile subjects is the ability to maintain a reliable, uninterrupted, high-throughput data link. We designed and built an ultralow-power On-Off-Key (OOK) transmitter ASIC that is housed within the neurosensor (Figure 2A, also see Figure S1 available online). For full use of its power-efficient high-frequency performance, the ASIC resides on a low-loss dielectric substrate (Rogers 4003) and exploits a 3.1 GHz to 5 GHz ultrawide band (UWB) chip antenna. The transmission chip is configured to reach data rates up to 200 Mbit/s over a short distance (1–2 m) while operating at a DC/RF conversion efficiency of 40%. The 40% efficiency includes both the 4 mW and the boosted 15 mW and is the efficiency of the PA itself, not including the antenna efficiency. Other designs of advanced power amplifier (PA) have achieved >50% efficiency using envelope-tracking technologies but high efficiency was only achievable at the cost of high power. For our application, the challenge was to design an efficient ultralow-power system where the high PA output impedance had to be reconciled with matching to the 50 Ω antenna for high-RF output efficiency. To resolve this issue, we used a novel stacked PA design, reducing the output impedance by half and greatly simplifying matching to the antenna impedance. Altogether, and compared to other wireless systems that record spike times and, intermittently, waveforms (Schwarz et al., 2014Schwarz D.A. Lebedev M.A. Hanson T.L. Dimitrov D.F. Lehew G. Meloy J. Rajangam S. Subramanian V. Ifft P.J. Li Z. et al.Chronic, wireless recordings of large-scale brain activity in freely moving rhesus monkeys.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), our system provides real-time recording of high-fidelity broadband signals (<0.1 Hz to 7.8 kHz) across all channels, thereby enabling robust post hoc analysis of the data. The complete neural signal flow, from extracellular voltage at the microelectrode tip to raw trace on the recording computer, is shown in Figure 2D. Mobile telemetry systems often suffer from signal loss due to multipath fading and electromagnetic interference, which leads to severe impediments for long-term, high-fidelity neural recording in large-scale environments. We adapted the SIMO telecommunication scheme used for cellular data transmission to design a multiple receiver concept using four antennas (Figure 2B) that simultaneously received the broadband neural data (Figures 2B and 2C). The most reliable signal is identified and dynamically gated from the spatially distributed system and transferred to signal-processing electronics (Figures 2B and 2C, IX). This approach shifts the hardware burden to the RF receiver system where space and power are more abundant. In theory, the number of receiving antennas can be expanded ad infinitum in order to achieve full spatial coverage of neural signal acquisition within vast and geometrically complex environments. For example, a network of antennas could be envisioned within a patient’s home. To assess the performance of our wireless neurosensor, we recorded continuous, broadband activity from a 96-channel intracortical microelectrode array implanted in the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex in a rhesus monkey (monkey 1). Single units were extracted and sorted from all channels (80 channels of possible 96 contained one or more spiking units), which highlighted the high-quality, uninterrupted collection of broadband data (Figures 3A–3C). Up to three single units could be clearly separated from single electrodes (Figure 3E). We then examined the structure of local field potentials (LFPs), which is a primary carrier of information related to synchronous synaptic input within a local neuronal population (Figure 3C). Spectrogram analysis of LFPs across all the electrodes, as illustrated for one electrode (Figure 3F), revealed robust modulation in both low- (1–30 Hz) and high- (100–250 Hz) frequency bands of recorded neural signals. These combined results illustrate the richness and fidelity of the wirelessly acquired neural data. We then verified the quality of the neural signals recorded with our wireless neurosensor compared to data obtained using conventional cabled technologies. We conducted intracortical recordings from the same monkey (monkey 1) who was performing a center-out reaching task sitting in a standard electrophysiology experimental chair (Figure 4A). Neural data were recorded sequentially on the same day using both cabled electronics and our wireless neurosensor. To compare neural signal quality, we applied a series of well-established spike sorting and signal comparison techniques on all the raw signals from the 96 channels. Specifically, we extracted (1) the original raw time-series data, (2) high-frequency spiking activity (high-pass), (3) low-frequency LFPs (low-pass), and (4) metrics related to single-unit activity including interspike intervals (ISIs), spike overlay, and principal component analysis (PCA)-based classification of individual single units (Figure 4C). Statistical comparisons across all the channels exhibiting spiking activity demonstrated the perfect equivalence between neural data acquired with cabled electronics compared to our wireless neurosensor (Student’s t test, p > 0.9, n = 500). We next illustrate the capacity of our wireless neurosensor in challenging environments for research on nonhuman primates. For example, tethered connections have hindered study of neuronal population dynamics underlying leg movement during natural locomotion in monkeys. Few attempts have been made to access neuronal modulation from cortical regions during locomotion (Fitzsimmons et al., 2009Fitzsimmons N.A. Lebedev M.A. Peikon I.D. Nicolelis M.A.L. Extracting kinematic parameters for monkey bipedal walking from cortical neuronal ensemble activity.Front Integr Neurosci. 2009; 3: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), but recordings were performed under highly constrained conditions due to the need for cabled electronics. Recently, a limited data set of spiking activity was collected from premotor cortical areas of a rhesus monkey walking on a treadmill (Foster et al., 2014Foster J.D. Nuyujukian P. Freifeld O. Gao H. Walker R. Ryu S.I. Meng T.H. Murmann B. Black M.J. Shenoy K.V. A freely-moving monkey treadmill model.J. Neural Eng. 2014; 11: 046020Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our wireless technology enables acquisition of full-spectrum neuronal population dynamics in untethered freely moving monkeys (Figure 5A). We implanted a 96-electrode MEA in the leg area of the primary motor cortex in three rhesus monkeys (monkeys 2, 3, and 4). In addition, bipolar electrodes were implanted into a pair of agonist and antagonist muscles for each joint of the contralateral leg in order to record electromyography (EMG) activity. A total of eight muscles were acquired wirelessly using a commercial implanted transmitter (Courtine et al., 2005Courtine G. Roy R.R. Hodgson J. McKay H. Raven J. Zhong H. Yang H. Tuszynski M.H. Edgerton V.R. Kinematic and EMG determinants in quadrupedal locomotion of a non-human primate (Rhesus).J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 3127-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Figure 5B). EMG activity and neural data were collected in conjunction with whole-body kinematics while the monkeys were walking without any constraints on a treadmill across a broad range of velocities (1.6, 3.2, 4.8, and 6.4 kph; Figure 5C and Movie S1). All three monkeys displayed robust and reproducible modulation of motor cortex spiking activity that was distributed across the entire gait cycle (Figure 5C). The temporal structure of neuronal ensemble modulation coevolved with speed-dependent changes in joint angles and leg muscle activity patterns (Figure 5C). In contrast, we found no systematic modulation of motor cortex neurons during rest (Figure S4). To investigate whether neuronal modulations contained an underlying structure reflecting locomotion, we calculated latent dimensions using Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA) applied on all the sorted single units (Yu et al., 2009Yu B.M. Cunningham J.P. Santhanam G. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Sahani M. Gaussian-process factor analysis for low-dimensional single-trial analysis of neural population activity.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 102: 614-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). When plotted in a 3D space, the three first latent dimensions followed a highly reproducible path during both the stance (gray) and swing (blue) phases of gait, highlighting the cyclic ensemble modulation during gait in monkeys (Figure 5B). Adjustment of latent dimensions matched speed-dependent changes in kinematic variables (Figure 5C). Our connection-free, multimodal recording platform provides unprecedented opportunities for dissecting the role of specific neural populations in the production of natural locomotion and for the design of translational neuroprosthetic treatments. Fast data transmission (<50 ms) may be critical for such a recording interface to play a role in rehabilitative therapy where neural plasticity can be leveraged. We note that our system has a total delay, from initial voltage at the electrode-electrolyte interface to output to a computer, on the order of 100 ms. Electromagnetic data transfer consumes ∼1 ns during propagation (∼3 m), ∼20 μs in analog delay clock and data recovery circuitry, and ∼40 μs digital delay before entering the NSP or computer, which is sufficient for real-time neural sensing and applications. We next demonstrate the ability to safely and reliably record neural data for extended periods of time to investigate fully natural behavior such as sleep, which faces two major challenges in nonhuman primates. First, study of natural sleep-wake transition requires neural recordings of a completely unconstrained subject resting in a comfortable and safe environment. Second, the intrinsic dynamics of sleep behavior necessitates continuous recordings of population dynamics for extended periods of time (Figure 6A). We conducted overnight recordings of broadband neural signals from the primary motor cortex of two rhesus monkeys resting in their home cage under continuous video monitoring (monkeys 5 and 6). Technological limitations restricted previous studies on sleep-wake transitions to recordings of a few neurons (Zanos et al., 2011Zanos S. Richardson A.G. Shupe L. Miles F.P. Fetz E.E.

Analysis of neuronal ensemble modulation over 8 consecutive hours allowed us to identify the electrophysiological signatures of sleep-wake transitions that had been independently described from electroencephalogram (Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004Buzsáki G.

The polarity of these cells' responses is thought to be fixed, but Tikidji-Hamburyan and colleagues now demonstrate in mouse and pig retina that they can change depending on ambient illuminance. For instance, an OFF cell can gain or lose an ON response at different light levels. Such changes in response polarity propagate to higher visual centers in vivo. The collective activity pattern of retinal ganglion cells, the retinal code, underlies higher visual processing. How does the ambient illuminance of the visual scene influence this retinal output? We recorded from isolated mouse and pig retina and from mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vivo at up to seven ambient light levels covering the scotopic to photopic regimes. Across each luminance transition, most ganglion cells exhibited qualitative response changes, whereas they maintained stable responses within each luminance. We commonly observed the appearance and disappearance of ON responses in OFF cells and vice versa. Such qualitative response changes occurred for a variety of stimuli, including full-field and localized contrast steps and naturalistic movies. Our results suggest that the retinal code is not fixed but varies with every change of ambient luminance. This finding raises questions about signal processing within the retina and has implications for visual processing in higher brain areas."

Vast quantities of born-digital data are being produced in a wide variety of forms at a rapid rate in universities. This paper analyses the contribution of academic libraries to research data management (RDM) in the wider institutional context. In particular it: examines the roles and relationships involved in RDM, identifies the main components of an RDM programme, evaluates the major drivers for RDM activities, and analyses the key factors influencing the shape of RDM developments. The study is written from the perspective of library professionals, analysing data from 26 semi-structured interviews of library staff from different UK institutions. This is an early qualitative contribution to the topic complementing existing quantitative and case study approaches. Results show that although libraries are playing a significant role in RDM, there is uncertainty and variation in the relationship with other stakeholders such as IT services and research support offices. Current emphases in RDM programmes are on developments of policies and guidelines, with some early work on technology infrastructures and support services. Drivers for developments include storage, security, quality, compliance, preservation, and sharing with libraries associated most closely with the last three. The paper also highlights a ‘jurisdictional’ driver in which libraries are claiming a role in this space. A wide range of factors, including governance, resourcing and skills, are identified as influencing ongoing developments. From the analysis, a model is constructed designed to capture the main aspects of an institutional RDM programme. This model helps to clarify the different issues involved in RDM, identifying layers of activity, multiple stakeholders and drivers, and a large number of factors influencing the implementation of any initiative. Institutions may usefully benchmark their activities against the data and model in order to inform ongoing RDM activity."
https://openalex.org/W2009324406,"Hyperpolarizing and inhibitory GABA regulates critical periods for plasticity in sensory cortices. Here we examine the role of early, depolarizing GABA in the control of plasticity mechanisms. We report that brief interference with depolarizing GABA during early development prolonged critical-period plasticity in visual cortical circuits without affecting the overall development of the visual system. The effects on plasticity were accompanied by dampened inhibitory neurotransmission, downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and reduced density of extracellular matrix perineuronal nets. Early interference with depolarizing GABA decreased perinatal BDNF signaling, and a pharmacological increase of BDNF signaling during GABA interference rescued the effects on plasticity and its regulators later in life. We conclude that depolarizing GABA exerts a long-lasting, selective modulation of plasticity of cortical circuits by a strong crosstalk with BDNF."

We show, however, that spike locking to theta oscillations allows assigning unidentified extracellular recordings to pyramidal and stellate cells with ∼83% and ∼89% specificity, respectively. In pooled anatomically identified and theta-locking-assigned recordings, nonspatial discharges dominated, and weakly hexagonal spatial discharges and head-direction selectivity were observed in both cell types. Clear grid discharges were rare and mostly classified as pyramids (19%, 19/99 putative pyramids versus 3%, 3/94 putative stellates). Most border cells were classified as stellate (11%, 10/94 putative stellates versus 1%, 1/99 putative pyramids).

https://openalex.org/W2004573605,"Sensory stimuli fluctuate on many timescales. However, short-term plasticity causes synapses to act as temporal filters, limiting the range of frequencies that they can transmit. How synapses in vivo might transmit a range of frequencies in spite of short-term plasticity is poorly understood. The first synapse in the Drosophila olfactory system exhibits short-term depression, but can transmit broadband signals. Here we describe two mechanisms that broaden the frequency characteristics of this synapse. First, two distinct excitatory postsynaptic currents transmit signals on different timescales. Second, presynaptic inhibition dynamically updates synaptic properties to promote accurate transmission of signals across a wide range of frequencies. Inhibition is transient, but grows slowly, and simulations reveal that these two features of inhibition promote broadband synaptic transmission. Dynamic inhibition is often thought to restrict the temporal patterns that a neuron responds to, but our results illustrate a different idea: inhibition can expand the bandwidth of neural coding."

Prefrontal D1Rs modulate spatial working memory performance (Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic, 1991Sawaguchi T. Goldman-Rakic P.S.

In rhesus monkeys engaged in a spatial working memory task, PFC neurons active in the delay period of the task showed improved tuning to preferred remembered locations when stimulated with D1R agonists (Vijayraghavan et al., 2007Vijayraghavan S. Wang M. Birnbaum S.G. Williams G.V. Arnsten A.F.T. Inverted-U dopamine D1 receptor actions on prefrontal neurons engaged in working memory.Nat.

D2Rs, on the other hand, do not modulate spatial persistent mnemonic-related activity in the PFC (Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic, 1994Sawaguchi T. Goldman-Rakic P.S.

Selective D2 receptor actions on the functional circuitry of working memory.Science. 2004; 303: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Instead, D2Rs selectively modulate neuronal activities associated with memory-guided saccades in oculomotor delayed-response tasks (Wang et al., 2004Wang M. Vijayraghavan S. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Selective D2 receptor actions on the functional circuitry of working memory.Science. 2004; 303: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition, rodent studies suggest that D2Rs are involved in flexible behavior. Blockade of D2Rs impairs the ability of rats to switch between different response strategies (Floresco and Magyar, 2006Floresco S.B. Magyar O. Mesocortical dopamine modulation of executive functions: beyond working memory.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2006; 188: 567-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In humans, D2R stimulation increases blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity in the PFC when flexibly switching between rules (Stelzel et al., 2013Stelzel C. Fiebach C.J. Cools R. Tafazoli S.

Both prefrontal D1Rs and D2Rs are critical for learning new association rules. Blocking D1Rs or D2Rs impairs neural selectivity to learned saccade directions (Puig and Miller, 2012Puig M.V.

We hypothesized that both D1Rs and D2Rs play a crucial role in regulating rule-guided decision-making, a hallmark feature of executive control and central to flexible behavior. Executive control is required for processing numbers and quantity information according to abstract principles, or rules, of how to structure, process, and evaluate numerical information. PFC neurons represent these semantic aspects of numerical quantities (Nieder et al., 2002Nieder A. Freedman D.J. Miller E.K.

Here, we therefore studied the activity of individual PFC neurons in rhesus monkeys required to flexibly switch between “greater than”/“less than” rules. By selectively activating or blocking D1Rs or D2Rs in the PFC, we report that dopamine modulates the neuronal coding of abstract rules through both receptor families by distinct physiological mechanisms. To determine if and how the dopaminergic system modulates abstract rule coding in the PFC, we trained two macaque monkeys to apply numerical rules to numerosities and to flexibly switch between the rules based on cues shown during each trial (Bongard and Nieder, 2010Bongard S.

USA. 2010; 107: 2277-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, Eiselt and Nieder, 2013Eiselt A.-K. Nieder A. Representation of abstract quantitative rules applied to spatial and numerical magnitudes in primate prefrontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 7526-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (see Figure 1A for protocol and details). Rule-related activity was investigated in the delay 2 period, after the behavioral rule was indicated via the rule cues, but before the monkeys could prepare a motor plan. Simultaneous neuronal recordings and microiontophoretic drug application started after the monkeys had learned to proficiently apply the “greater than/“less than” rules, irrespective of the absolute values of the three sample numerosities (“2,” “8,” or “32”), the two rule-cue modalities (red/blue versus water/no-water), and the visual appearance of the multiple-item dot displays. Average correct performances were 98% for monkey E and 85% for monkey O (Figure 1B). We recorded 384 randomly selected single neurons from the lateral PFC of two macaque monkeys (246 from monkey E, 138 from monkey O) (Figure 1C) performing the rule-switching task. To directly assess the impact of dopamine receptor targeting agents, control conditions without drug application alternated with drug conditions in each recording session. In each session, we tested one of three different substances that selectively targeted the D1R or the D2R: the D1R agonist SKF81297, the D1R antagonist SCH23390, and the D2R agonist quinpirole. Physiological NaCl solution was used as control. Rule-selective neurons were identified based on a significant main effect of the behavioral rule on the discharge rate in the delay 2 period using a four-way ANOVA (with main factors iontophoresis condition [control/drug], sample numerosity [“2”/“8”/“32”], behavioral rule [“greater than”/“less than”], and rule-cue modality [red/blue versus water/no-water]; p < 0.05). To ensure that neuronal responses varied with the rule rather than with the rule cue, we excluded neurons that showed a significant interaction of the main factors rule and rule-cue modality. A total of 17% (64/384) of all tested neurons encoded abstract numerical rules (Table 1) and entered subsequent analyses. A similar number of neurons preferred the “greater than” rule (34 neurons with higher discharge for the “greater than” rule) and the “less than” rule (30 neurons exhibiting higher response rates for the “less than” rule).Table 1Numbers of Recorded Neurons with Each Drug and Respective Number of Rule-Selective Neurons, Selective for “Greater Than” or “Less Than” RulesDrugTotal NeuronsRule-Selective (Greater/Less)SKF81297 (D1R agonist)12320 (12/8)SCH23390 (D1R antagonist)11218 (8/10)Quinpirole (D2R agonist)7916 (7/9)NaCl7010 (7/3)Sum38464 Open table in a new tab The coding properties of rule-selective neurons were modulated by drugs targeting either D1Rs or D2Rs. Figure 2A shows a “less than”-rule-selective neuron that differentiated more between “greater than” and “less than” rules (irrespective of rule-cue modalities) after stimulation with D1R agonist SKF81297 (Figure 2A). In contrast, blocking the D1R with SCH23390 strongly reduced rule selectivity of a different neuron that preferred the “greater than” rule in control conditions (Figure 2C). When targeting the D2Rs, rule selectivity was also affected. Stimulation of the D2R with quinpirole increased selectivity in a “less than”-rule-selective neuron (Figure 2E). To analyze population responses, the responses of neurons classified as “greater than”- or “less than”-rule-selective neurons were normalized and averaged. Stimulating the D1R with SKF81297 increased the differentiation between the preferred rule (red trace) and the nonpreferred rule (blue trace) in the population of rule-selective neurons tested with SKF81297 (Figure 2B) by increasing the mean difference in normalized discharge rates (ΔR = +0.37 ± 0.12 [SEM], p = 0.01, n = 20, Wilcoxon test). Conversely, blocking the D1R with SCH23390 significantly reduced the rule selectivity of rule-selective neurons recorded with SCH23390 (Figure 2D; ΔR = –0.17 ± 0.05, p = 0.01, n = 18, Wilcoxon test). Stimulating the D2R with quinpirole also increased the differentiation between the preferred rule and the nonpreferred rule in the population of all rule-selective neurons recorded with quinpirole (Figure 2F; ΔR = +0.29 ± 0.078, p = 0.001, n = 16, Wilcoxon test). After terminating iontophoretic drug application, neuronal rule selectivity returned to the same levels as prior to the first drug application, i.e., the drug effects washed out (see Figures S1A, S1C, S1E, and S1G; see Supplemental Information available online). Iontophoretic application of NaCl did not change rule-selective responses (Figures S2A and S2B, p = 0.1, n = 10, Wilcoxon test), confirming drug-specific effects. We characterized the quality of rule coding for each rule-selective neuron (identified by the ANOVA) during control and drug conditions by determining the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) (see Experimental Procedures) using the discharge rates in the same analysis window as for the ANOVA. Stimulating the D1R increased the coding strength (AUROCs) in 75% (15/20) of all rule-selective neurons tested with SKF81297 (Figure 3A; mean ΔAUROC = +0.080 ± 0.023 [SEM], p = 0.004, n = 20, Wilcoxon test). In contrast, blocking the D1R with SCH23390 decreased the AUROCs in 83% (15/18) of the rule-selective neurons, thus impairing rule coding (Figure 3C; ΔAUROC = –0.044 ± 0.016, p = 0.01, n = 18, Wilcoxon test). Stimulation of the D2R with quinpirole also increased the AUROCs in almost all rule-selective neurons (88%, or 14/16) (Figure 3E, ΔAUROC = +0.050 ± 0.012, p = 0.002, n = 16, Wilcoxon test). After terminating iontophoretic drug application, AUROCs returned to the same levels as prior to the first drug application phase, i.e., the drug effects washed out (Figures S1B, S1D, S1F, S1H; Supplemental Information). Iontophoretic application of NaCl did not change AUROCs and thus left rule coding unaffected (Figure S2C; p = 0.8, n = 10, Wilcoxon test). In summary, both D1R and D2R activation facilitated rule coding in the PFC. We used a sliding ROC analysis to assess the time course of rule coding after rule-cue presentation and throughout the entire delay 2 period (Figures 3B, 3D, and 3F). In general, coding quality increased during the delay 2 period. D1R stimulation with SKF81297 caused a more prominent increase of AUROCs compared to control conditions, particularly in the second half of the delay 2 period (Figure 3B, left panel). The average latency of rule coding, defined as the time to the first significant rule coding from delay 2 onset (see Experimental Procedures), did not change after D1R stimulation (Figure 3B; right panel, mean Δlatency = 90 ms ± 103 ms [SEM], p = 0.6, Wilcoxon test testing Δlatency against zero). Blocking D1Rs with SCH23390 impaired AUROCs during the delay period (Figure 3D, left panel) but left the average latency unchanged (Figure 3D; right panel, Δlatency = –13 ms ± 75 ms, p = 0.8, Wilcoxon test). Stimulating D2Rs with quinpirole resulted in elevated AUROCs in particular in the second half of the delay phase (Figure 3F, left panel), while not changing average latency (Figure 3F, right panel, Δlatency = –93 ms ± 50 ms, p = 0.3, Wilcoxon test). Thus, the temporal profile during the delay 2 period was not modulated by dopamine receptor stimulation. To investigate whether the dopaminergic system differentially modulates neuronal responses to the preferred and the nonpreferred rule, we calculated a drug modulation index (MI). The MI indicated if discharges to the preferred and/or nonpreferred rule were modulated by the drug, in comparison to the baseline (see Experimental Procedures). Stimulating the D1R with SKF81297 specifically increased neuronal responses to the preferred rule (mean MI = +0.35 ± 0.13 [SEM], p = 0.01, Wilcoxon test against zero MI), but not to the nonpreferred rule (MI = +0.015 ± 0.090, p = 0.9) (Figure 4A; p = 0.01 Wilcoxon test between MIs for the preferred and nonpreferred rules). Consequently, blocking the D1R with SCH23390 reduced neuronal responses to the preferred rule (MI = –0.23 ± 0.083, p = 0.02), while leaving neuronal responses to the nonpreferred rule unaffected (MI = –0.057 ± 0.071, p = 0.9) (Figure 4B; p = 0.01). In contrast, stimulating the D2R with quinpirole reduced neuronal responses to the nonpreferred rule (MI = –0.13 ± 0.071, p = 0.02), but not to the preferred rule (MI = +0.015 ± 0.060, p = 0.3) (Figure 4C; p = 0.03), thus enlarging the differentiation between the preferred and nonpreferred rule as witnessed in previous analysis (Figure 2F). Differences in the modulation indices could be caused by changes of the discharge rates or by changes in the variability of neuronal discharges. We therefore computed the Fano factor as a measure of the trial-by-trial variability of neuronal discharges (Nawrot et al., 2008Nawrot M.P. Boucsein C. Rodriguez Molina V. Riehle A. Aertsen A. Rotter S. Measurement of variability dynamics in cortical spike trains.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2008; 169: 374-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). None of the tested drugs changed the Fano factors in the baseline period (Figures S3A–S3D; Supplemental Information) or the delay 2 period for either preferred or nonpreferred rules (Figures S3E–S3H; Supplemental Information). This confirms that changes in rule-related firing rates (relative to the overall firing rates) rather than changes in discharge variability drive the changes in modulation indices. Taken together, stimulation of both D1Rs and D2Rs improved rule selectivity, but in distinct ways: D1Rs specifically modulated the neuronal responses to the preferred rule (but not to the nonpreferred rule); D2Rs, on the other hand, modulated neuronal response to the nonpreferred rule (but not to the preferred rule). Because the monkeys were required to apply rules to numerosities, we also analyzed whether prefrontal dopamine receptors might modulate the encoding of numerical values. We quantified the coding strength of the numerical value in numerosity-selective neurons during the sample period by comparing responses to preferred and nonpreferred sample numerosities. D1R stimulation increased AUROCs of numerosity-selective neurons tested with SKF81297, significantly enhancing sample numerosity coding (Figure 5A; mean ΔAUROC = +0.04 ± 0.02 [SEM], n = 28, p = 0.02, Wilcoxon test). Blocking D1Rs with SCH23390 did not significantly modulate AUROCs (Figure 5C; ΔAUROC = +0.001 ± 0.02, n = 13, p = 0.7, Wilcoxon test). D2R stimulation with quinpirole did not systematically change AUROCs (Figure 5E; ΔAUROC = +0.02 ± 0.03, n = 22, p = 0.6, Wilcoxon test). Thus, D1R stimulation modulated sample numerosity coding, while D2R stimulation did not. To study these effects in more detail, we separately analyzed drug impact on the responses to the preferred and nonpreferred numerosity. Application of SKF81297 did not modulate neuronal responses to nonpreferred (mean MI = –0.8 ± 0.4 [SEM], p = 0.2, Wilcoxon test against zero MI) or preferred (MI = –0.8 ± 0.4, p = 0.2) sample numerosities alone (Figure 5B; p = 0.4, Wilcoxon test between MIs for nonpreferred and preferred sample numerosities). Application of SCH23390 increased neuronal responses to nonpreferred sample numerosities (MI = +1.6 ± 0.8, p = 0.02), but also tended to increase responses to preferred sample numerosites (MI = +1.3 ± 0.6, p = 0.07), thus resulting in no coding differences (Figure 5D; p = 0.7). Application of quinpirole did not modulate neuronal responses to nonpreferred (MI = +0.3 ± 0.3, p = 0.2) or preferred (MI = +0.7 ± 0.7, p = 0.3) sample numerosities (Figure 5F; p = 0.5). In sum, sample coding was not modulated by specific changes of neuronal responses to preferred or nonpreferred sample numerosities. D1Rs and D2Rs modulated baseline discharge rates (during the fixation period) of the population of all neurons. SKF81297 slightly decreased baseline discharge rates (Figure 6A; ΔFR = –0.27 Hz, p = 0.04, n = 123, Wilcoxon test), and SCH23390 mildly increased baseline activity (Figure 6B; ΔFR = +0.75 Hz, p = 0.05, n = 112, Wilcoxon test), whereas quinpirole enhanced baseline rates (Figure 6C; ΔFR = +1.1 Hz, p = 10−5, n = 79, Wilcoxon test). No baseline modulation was found after applying NaCl solution as a control (Figure 6D; ΔFR = +0.060 Hz, p = 0.5, n = 70, Wilcoxon test). Figure 6E displays the average time courses of drug-influenced baseline activity that differed significantly (Figure 6F; p = 10−7, Kruskal-Wallis test). Dopamine receptor manipulation did not change neuronal trial-by-trial variability measured by the Fano factor (Nawrot et al., 2008Nawrot M.P. Boucsein C. Rodriguez Molina V. Riehle A. Aertsen A. Rotter S. Measurement of variability dynamics in cortical spike trains.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2008; 169: 374-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) in the baseline period (Figures S3A–S3D; Supplemental Information). In sum, stimulating D1Rs inhibited neurons, while blocking D1Rs excited neurons. Strong excitation was observed after stimulating D2Rs. Next, we asked if modulation of prefrontal dopamine receptors influenced the monkeys’ behavior. Since monkeys did not show any switch costs (Figure S4; Supplemental Information) consistent with findings reported in task-switching paradigms (Stoet and Snyder, 2009Stoet G. Snyder L.H. Neural correlates of executive control functions in the monkey.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2009; 13: 228-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we focused our behavioral analysis on changes in performance and reaction times. Iontophoretic drug application is highly focal (Herz et al., 1969Herz A. Zieglgänsberger W. Färber G. Microelectrophoretic studies concerning the spread of glutamic acid and GABA in brain tissue.Exp. Brain Res. 1969; 9: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and most primate studies that iontophoretically applied drugs to the cortex did not report any behavioral changes (Williams and Goldman-Rakic, 1995Williams G.V.

Neurosci. 2007; 10: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). However, small modulations of reaction times were reported in some studies (Herrero et al., 2008Herrero J.L. Roberts M.J. Delicato L.S. Gieselmann M.A. Dayan P. Thiele A.

Due to extensive training, behavioral performance was at ceiling levels (see Figure 1) and did not change after drug application (Figure 7A; p > 0.1 for all drugs, Wilcoxon test over recording sessions). However, drug application slightly modulated behavioral reaction times (Figure 7B). Stimulating D1Rs with SKF81297 increased reactions times (ΔRT = +3.2 ms, p = 0.004, Mann-Whitney U test). Accordingly, blocking D1Rs with SCH23390 decreased reaction times (ΔRT = –2.8 ms, p = 0.03, Mann-Whitney U test). Stimulating D2Rs with quinpirole increased reaction times (ΔRT = +1.8 ms, p = 0.04, Mann-Whitney U test). As a control, application of NaCl did not produce changes in reaction times (ΔRT = –0.1 ms, p = 0.3, Mann-Whitney U test). Thus, manipulation of both prefrontal D1Rs and D2Rs produced changes in the"

Development of a more efficient and environmentally sound alternative flocculant agent is investigated in this paper. Bioflocculants are produced by microorganisms and may exhibit a high rate of flocculation activity. The bioflocculant ETH-2, with high flocculating activity (2849 mg Kaolin particle/mg ETH-2), produced by strain Enterobacter sp. isolated from activated sludge, was systematically investigated with regard to its production, characterization, and flocculation mechanism. Analyses of microscopic observation, zeta potential and ETH-2 structure demonstrates the bridging mechanism, as opposed to charge neutralization, was responsible for flocculation of the ETH-2. ETH-2 retains high molecular weight (603 to 1820 kDa) and multi-functional groups (hydroxyl, amide and carboxyl) that contributed to flocculation. Polysaccharides mainly composed of mannose, glucose, and galactose, with a molar ratio of 1∶2.9∶9.8 were identified as the active constituents in bioflocculant. The structure of the long backbone with active sites of polysaccharides was determined as a primary basis for the high flocculation activity. Bioflocculant ETH-2 is cation independent, pH tolerant, and thermally stable, suggesting a potential fit for industrial application."

Autophagy has emerged as critical in clearing dysfunctional organelles and thus in regulating protein turnover. Here we show that endolysosomal two-pore channel subtype 2 (TPC2) contributes to autophagy signaling and protein homeostasis in skeletal muscle. Muscles derived from Tpcn2−/− mice exhibit an atrophic phenotype with exacerbated autophagy under starvation. Compared with wild types, animals lacking TPC2 demonstrated an enhanced autophagy flux characterized by increased accumulation of autophagosomes upon combined stress induction by starvation and colchicine treatment. In addition, deletion of TPC2 in muscle caused aberrant lysosomal pH homeostasis and reduced lysosomal protease activity. Association between mammalian target of rapamycin and TPC2 was detected in skeletal muscle, allowing for appropriate adjustments to cellular metabolic states and subsequent execution of autophagy. TPC2 therefore impacts mammalian target of rapamycin reactivation during the process of autophagy and contributes to maintenance of muscle homeostasis. Background: The endolysosomal TPC2 ion channel interacts with mTOR to regulate cellular energy utilization. Results: Mice lacking TPC2 display muscle atrophy phenotype with reduced muscle endurance, altered autophagy, and lysosomal enzymatic activities. Conclusion: TPC2 regulates autophagic signaling in skeletal muscle. Significance: TPC2 impacts protein turnover via regulating autophagy signaling in the process of tissue homeostasis and aging."
https://openalex.org/W2034182536,"Inducible expression of chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase is a major cause of β-lactam antibiotic resistance in the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. AmpC expression is induced by the LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) AmpR, which activates ampC expression in response to changes in peptidoglycan (PG) metabolite levels that occur during exposure to β-lactams. Under normal conditions, AmpR represses ampC transcription by binding the PG precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc)-pentapeptide. When exposed to β-lactams, however, PG catabolites (1,6-anhydroMurNAc-peptides) accumulate in the cytosol, which have been proposed to competitively displace UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide from AmpR and convert it into an activator of ampC transcription. Here we describe the molecular interactions between AmpR (from Citrobacter freundii), its DNA operator, and repressor UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. Non-denaturing mass spectrometry revealed AmpR to be a homotetramer that is stabilized by DNA containing the T-N11-A LTTR binding motif and revealed that it can bind four repressor molecules in an apparently stepwise manner. A crystal structure of the AmpR effector-binding domain bound to UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide revealed that the terminal d-Ala-d-Ala motif of the repressor forms the primary contacts with the protein. This observation suggests that 1,6-anhydroMurNAc-pentapeptide may convert AmpR into an activator of ampC transcription more effectively than 1,6-anhydroMurNAc-tripeptide (which lacks the d-Ala-d-Ala motif). Finally, small angle x-ray scattering demonstrates that the AmpR·DNA complex adopts a flat conformation similar to the LTTR protein AphB and undergoes only a slight conformational change when binding UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. Modeling the AmpR·DNA tetramer bound to UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide predicts that the UDP-MurNAc moiety of the repressor participates in modulating AmpR function."

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released into circulation after cell damage can promote inflammation in patients and animal models. However, the role and mechanisms of circulatory mtDNA in chronic inflammation in MHD patients remain unknown. Sixty MHD patients and 20 health controls were enrolled in this study. The circulatory mtDNA was detected by quantitative real-time PCR assay. Plasma interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were quantitated by ELISA assay. Dialysis systems in MHD patients and in vitro were used to evaluate the effect of different dialysis patterns on circulatory mtDNA. Circulatory mtDNA was elevated in MHD patients comparing to that of health control. Regression analysis demonstrated that plasma mtDNA was positively associated with TNF-α and the product of serum calcium and phosphorus, while negatively associated with hemoglobin and serum albumin in MHD patients. MtDNA induced the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α in the THP-1 cells. Single high-flux hemodialysis (HF-HD) and on line hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) but not low-flux hemodialysis (LF-HD) could partially reduce plasma mtDNA in MHD patients. In vitro, both HD and hemofiltration (HF) could fractional remove mtDNA. Collectively, circulatory mtDNA is elevated and its level is closely correlated with chronic inflammation in MHD patients.

https://openalex.org/W2032447771,"Oligomer formation and accumulation of pathogenic proteins are key events in the pathomechanisms of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, ALS, and the polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases. The autophagy-lysosome degradation system may have therapeutic potential against these diseases because it can degrade even large oligomers. Although p62/sequestosome 1 plays a physiological role in selective autophagy of ubiquitinated proteins, whether p62 recognizes and degrades pathogenic proteins in neurodegenerative diseases has remained unclear. In this study, to elucidate the role of p62 in such pathogenic conditions in vivo, we used Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases. We found that p62 predominantly co-localizes with cytoplasmic polyQ protein aggregates in the MJDtr-Q78 polyQ disease model flies. Loss of p62 function resulted in significant exacerbation of eye degeneration in these flies. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed enhanced accumulation of cytoplasmic aggregates by p62 knockdown in the MJDtr-Q78 flies, similarly to knockdown of autophagy-related genes (Atgs). Knockdown of both p62 and Atgs did not show any additive effects in the MJDtr-Q78 flies, implying that p62 function is mediated by autophagy. Biochemical analyses showed that loss of p62 function delays the degradation of the MJDtr-Q78 protein, especially its oligomeric species. We also found that loss of p62 function exacerbates eye degeneration in another polyQ disease fly model as well as in ALS model flies. We therefore conclude that p62 plays a protective role against polyQ-induced neurodegeneration, by the autophagic degradation of polyQ protein oligomers in vivo, indicating its therapeutic potential for the polyQ diseases and possibly for other neurodegenerative diseases.Oligomers of pathogenic proteins are implicated in the pathomechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases.ResultsDepletion of p62 delays the degradation of polyglutamine protein oligomers via autophagy and exacerbates neurodegeneration in polyglutamine disease model flies.Conclusionp62 plays a protective role via autophagic degradation of polyglutamine protein oligomers.Significancep62 should be a therapeutic target for the polyglutamine diseases. Oligomer formation and accumulation of pathogenic proteins are key events in the pathomechanisms of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, ALS, and the polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases. The autophagy-lysosome degradation system may have therapeutic potential against these diseases because it can degrade even large oligomers. Although p62/sequestosome 1 plays a physiological role in selective autophagy of ubiquitinated proteins, whether p62 recognizes and degrades pathogenic proteins in neurodegenerative diseases has remained unclear. In this study, to elucidate the role of p62 in such pathogenic conditions in vivo, we used Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases. We found that p62 predominantly co-localizes with cytoplasmic polyQ protein aggregates in the MJDtr-Q78 polyQ disease model flies. Loss of p62 function resulted in significant exacerbation of eye degeneration in these flies. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed enhanced accumulation of cytoplasmic aggregates by p62 knockdown in the MJDtr-Q78 flies, similarly to knockdown of autophagy-related genes (Atgs). Knockdown of both p62 and Atgs did not show any additive effects in the MJDtr-Q78 flies, implying that p62 function is mediated by autophagy. Biochemical analyses showed that loss of p62 function delays the degradation of the MJDtr-Q78 protein, especially its oligomeric species. We also found that loss of p62 function exacerbates eye degeneration in another polyQ disease fly model as well as in ALS model flies. We therefore conclude that p62 plays a protective role against polyQ-induced neurodegeneration, by the autophagic degradation of polyQ protein oligomers in vivo, indicating its therapeutic potential for the polyQ diseases and possibly for other neurodegenerative diseases.Oligomers of pathogenic proteins are implicated in the pathomechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases.

NHE3 activity was measured with 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-S-(and 6)carboxyfluorescein acetoxy methylester/fluorometry. Surface NHE3 was determined by cell surface biotinylation. Identification of NHE3 phosphorylation sites was by iTRAQ/LC-MS/MS with TiO2 enrichment and immunoblotting with specific anti-phospho-NHE3 antibodies. cGMP/cGKII rapidly inhibited NHE3, which was associated with reduced surface NHE3. cGMP/cGKII increased NHE3 phosphorylation at three sites (rabbit Ser554, Ser607, and Ser663, equivalent to mouse Ser552, Ser605, and Ser659), all of which had to be present at the same time for cGMP to inhibit NHE3. NHE3-Ser663 phosphorylation was not necessary for cAMP inhibition of NHE3. Dexamethasone (4 h) stimulated wild type NHE3 activity and increased surface expression but failed to stimulate NHE3 activity or increase surface expression when NHE3 was mutated to either S663A or S663D.

https://openalex.org/W2087281324,"While significant progress has been made in understanding the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects of the natural diterpenoid component Oridonin on tumor cells, little is known about its effect on tumor angiogenesis or metastasis and on the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, Oridonin significantly suppressed human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation, migration, and apillary-like structure formation in vitro. Using aortic ring assay and mouse corneal angiogenesis model, we found that Oridonin inhibited angiogenesis ex vivo and in vivo. In our animal experiments, Oridonin impeded tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemistry analysis further revealed that the expression of CD31 and vWF protein in xenografts was remarkably decreased by the Oridonin. Furthermore, Oridonin reinforced endothelial cell-cell junction and impaired breast cancer cell transendothelial migration. Mechanistically, Oridonin not only down-regulated Jagged2 expression and Notch1 activity but also decreased the expression of their target genes. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an original role of Oridonin in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and propose a mechanism. This study also provides new evidence supporting the central role of Notch in tumor angiogenesis and suggests that Oridonin could be a potential drug candidate for angiogenesis related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2083206138,"The increasing clinical importance of infections caused by multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii warrants the development of novel approaches for prevention and treatment. In this context, vaccination of certain patient populations may contribute to reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by this pathogen. Vaccines against Gram-negative bacteria based on inactivated bacterial cells are highly immunogenic and have been shown to produce protective immunity against a number of bacterial species. However, the high endotoxin levels present in these vaccines due to the presence of lipopolysaccharide complicates their use in human vaccination. In the present study, we used a laboratory-derived strain of A. baumannii that completely lacks lipopolysaccharide due to a mutation in the lpxD gene (IB010), one of the genes involved in the first steps of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, for vaccination. We demonstrate that IB010 has greatly reduced endotoxin content (<1.0 endotoxin unit/106 cells) compared to wild type cells. Immunization with formalin inactivated IB010 produced a robust antibody response consisting of both IgG1 and IgG2c subtypes. Mice immunized with IB010 had significantly lower post-infection tissue bacterial loads and significantly lower serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 compared to control mice in a mouse model of disseminated A. baumannii infection. Importantly, immunized mice were protected from infection with the ATCC 19606 strain and an A. baumannii clinical isolate. These data suggest that immunization with inactivated A. baumannii whole cells deficient in lipopolysaccharide could serve as the basis for a vaccine for the prevention of infection caused by A. baumannii."

https://openalex.org/W2083401784,"Diet has been implicated as a major factor impacting clinical disease expression of swine dysentery and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae colonization. However, the impact of diet on novel pathogenic strongly beta-hemolytic Brachyspira spp. including “B. hampsonii” has yet to be investigated. In recent years, distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a source of insoluble dietary fiber, has been increasingly included in diets of swine. A randomized complete block experiment was used to examine the effect of increased dietary fiber through the feeding of DDGS on the incidence of Brachyspira-associated colitis in pigs. One hundred 4-week-old pigs were divided into five groups based upon inocula (negative control, Brachyspira intermedia, Brachyspira pilosicoli, B. hyodysenteriae or “B. hampsonii”) and fed one of two diets containing no (diet 1) or 30% (diet 2) DDGS. The average days to first positive culture and days post inoculation to the onset of clinical dysentery in the B. hyodysenteriae groups was significantly shorter for diet 2 when compared to diet 1 (P = 0.04 and P = 0.0009, respectively). A similar difference in the average days to first positive culture and days post inoculation to the onset of clinical dysentery was found when comparing the “B. hampsonii” groups. In this study, pigs receiving 30% DDGS shed on average one day prior to and developed swine dysentery nearly twice as fast as pigs receiving 0% DDGS. Accordingly, these data suggest a reduction in insoluble fiber through reducing or eliminating DDGS in swine rations should be considered an integral part of any effective disease elimination strategy for swine dysentery."
https://openalex.org/W1970525044,"Recycling is one of the most efficient methods for environmental friendly waste management. Among municipal wastes, plastics are the most common material that can be easily recycled and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of its major types. PET material is used in consumer goods packaging such as drinking bottles, toiletry containers, food packaging and many more. Usually, a recycling process is tailored to a specific material for optimal purification and decontamination to obtain high grade recyclable material. The quantity and quality of the sorting process are limited by the capacity of human workers that suffer from fatigue and boredom. Several automated sorting systems have been proposed in the literature that include using chemical, proximity and vision sensors. The main advantages of vision based sensors are its environmentally friendly approach, non-intrusive detection and capability of high throughput. However, the existing methods rely heavily on deterministic approaches that make them less accurate as the variations in PET plastic waste appearance are too high. We proposed a probabilistic approach of modeling the PET material by analyzing the reflection region and its surrounding. Three parameters are modeled by Gaussian and exponential distributions: color, size and distance of the reflection region. The final classification is made through a supervised training method of likelihood ratio test. The main novelty of the proposed method is the probabilistic approach in integrating various PET material signatures that are contaminated by stains under constant lighting changes. The system is evaluated by using four performance metrics: precision, recall, accuracy and error. Our system performed the best in all evaluation metrics compared to the benchmark methods. The system can be further improved by fusing all neighborhood information in decision making and by implementing the system in a graphics processing unit for faster processing speed."
https://openalex.org/W2100883317,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive strand RNA virus of the Flavivirus family that replicates in the cytoplasm of infected hepatocytes. Previously, several nuclear localization signals (NLS) and nuclear export signals (NES) have been identified in HCV proteins, however, there is little evidence that these proteins travel into the nucleus during infection. We have recently shown that nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins (termed nucleoporins or Nups) are present in the membranous web and are required during HCV infection. In this study, we identify a total of 11 NLS and NES sequences in various HCV proteins. We show direct interactions between HCV proteins and importin α5 (IPOA5/kapα1), importin β3 (IPO5/kap β3), and exportin 1 (XPO1/CRM1) both in-vitro and in cell culture. These interactions can be disrupted using peptides containing the specific NLS or NES sequences of HCV proteins. Moreover, using a synchronized infection system, we show that these peptides inhibit HCV infection during distinct phases of the HCV life cycle. The inhibitory effects of these peptides place them in two groups. The first group binds IPOA5 and inhibits infection during the replication stage of HCV life cycle. The second group binds IPO5 and is active during both early replication and early assembly. This work delineates the entire life cycle of HCV and the active involvement of NLS sequences during HCV replication and assembly. Given the abundance of NLS sequences within HCV proteins, our previous finding that Nups play a role in HCV infection, and the relocation of the NLS double-GFP reporter in HCV infected cells, this work supports our previous hypothesis that NPC-like structures and nuclear transport factors function in the membranous web to create an environment conducive to viral replication."

We have developed an in vivo approach involving the constant infusion of [13C]formate until isotopic steady state is attained to measure the rate of endogenous formate production in rats fed on either a folate-replete or folate-deficient diet. Formate was produced at a rate of 76 μmol·h−1·100 g of body weight−1 in the folate-replete rats, and this was decreased by 44% in folate-deficient rats. This decreased formate production was confirmed in isolated rat liver mitochondria where formate production from serine, the principal precursor of one-carbon groups, was decreased by 85%, although formate production from sarcosine and dimethylglycine (choline metabolites) was significantly increased. We attribute this unexpected result to the demonstrated production of formaldehyde by sarcosine dehydrogenase and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase from their respective substrates in the absence of tetrahydrofolate and subsequent formation of formate by formaldehyde dehydrogenase. Comparison of formate production with the ingestion of dietary formate precursors (serine, glycine, tryptophan, histidine, methionine, and choline) showed that ∼75% of these precursors were converted to formate, indicating that formate is a significant, although underappreciated end product of choline and amino acid oxidation.

Nationwide neonatal screening programs of lymphocyte production using T-cell recombination excision circles (TREC) have repeatedly identified patients with DGS. We tested what proportion of DGS patients could be identified at birth by combined TREC and kappa-deleting element recombination circle (KREC) screening. Furthermore, we followed TREC/KREC levels in peripheral blood (PB) to monitor postnatal changes in lymphocyte production. Methods TREC/KREC copies were assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and were related to the albumin control gene in dry blood spots (DBSs) from control (n = 56), severe immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID, n = 10) and DGS (n = 13) newborns. PB was evaluated in DGS children (n = 32), in diagnostic samples from SCID babies (n = 5) and in 91 controls. Results All but one DGS patient had TREC levels in the normal range at birth, albeit quantitative TREC values were significantly lower in the DGS cohort. One patient had slightly reduced KREC at birth. Postnatal DGS samples revealed reduced TREC numbers in 5 of 32 (16%) patients, whereas KREC copy numbers were similar to controls. Both TREC and KREC levels showed a more pronounced decrease with age in DGS patients than in controls (p<0.0001 for both in a linear model). DGS patients had higher percentages of NK cells at the expense of T cells (p<0.0001). The patients with reduced TREC levels had repeated infections in infancy and developed allergy and/or autoimmunity, but they were not strikingly different from other patients. In 12 DGS patients with paired DBS and blood samples, the TREC/KREC levels were mostly stable or increased and showed similar kinetics in respective patients. Conclusions The combined TREC/KREC approach with correction via control gene identified 1 of 13 (8%) of DiGeorge syndrome patients at birth in our cohort. The majority of patients had TREC/KREC levels in the normal range."
https://openalex.org/W2055668452,"Merkel cell carcinoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) infection and DNA integration into the host genome correlate with 80% of all Merkel cell carcinoma cases. Integration of the MCV genome frequently results in mutations in the large tumor antigen (LT), leading to expression of a truncated LT that retains pRB binding but with a deletion of the C-terminal domain. Studies from our laboratory and others have shown that the MCV LT C-terminal helicase domain contains growth-inhibiting properties. Additionally, we have shown that host DNA damage response factors are recruited to viral replication centers. In this study, we identified a novel MCV LT phosphorylation site at Ser-816 in the C-terminal domain. We demonstrate that activation of the ATM pathway stimulated MCV LT phosphorylation at Ser-816, whereas inhibition of ATM kinase activity prevented LT phosphorylation at this site. In vitro phosphorylation experiments confirmed that ATM kinase is responsible for phosphorylating MCV LT at Ser-816. Finally, we show that ATM kinase-mediated MCV LT Ser-816 phosphorylation may contribute to the anti-tumorigenic properties of the MCV LT C-terminal domain."

Objective The primary aim of this study was to determine predictors of death among hospitalized HIV-infected patients at a large urban hospital in Bangladesh. Methods A study was conducted in the HIV in-patient unit (Jagori Ward) of icddr,b's Dhaka Hospital. Characteristics of patients who died during hospitalization were compared to those of patients discharged from the ward. Bivariate analysis was performed to determine associations between potential risk factors and death. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with death. Results Of 293 patients admitted to the Jagori Ward, 57 died during hospitalization. Most hospitalized patients (67%) were male and the median age was 35 (interquartile range: 2–65) years. Overall, 153 (52%) patients were diagnosed with HIV within 6 months of hospitalization. The most common presumptive opportunistic infections (OIs) identified were tuberculosis (32%), oesophageal candidiasis (9%), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) (8%), and histoplasmosis (7%). On multivariable analysis, independent predictors of mortality were CD4 count ≤200 cells/mm3 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 16.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7–74.4), PJP (aOR: 18.5, 95% CI: 4.68–73.3), oesophageal candidiasis (aOR: 27.5, 95% CI: 5.5–136.9), malignancy (aOR:15.2, 95% CI: 2.3–99.4), and bacteriuria (aOR:7.9, 95% CI: 1.2–50.5). Being on antiretroviral therapy prior to hospitalization (aOR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.06–0.5) was associated with decreased mortality. Conclusion This study showed that most patients who died during hospitalization on the Jagori Ward had HIV-related illnesses which could have been averted with earlier diagnosis of HIV and proper management of OIs. It is prudent to develop a national HIV screening programme to facilitate early identification of HIV."

In the present study polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement functionalized with AgNP and/or gentamicin were tested regarding their biocompatibility with bone forming cells. Therefore, influences on viability, cell number and differentiation of primary human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSCs cultured in osteogenic differentiation media (MSC-OM) caused by the implant materials were studied. Furthermore, the growth behavior and the morphology of the cells on the testing material were observed. Finally, we examined the induction of cell stress, regarding antioxidative defense and endoplasmatic reticulum stress. We demonstrated similar cytocompatibility of PMMA loaded with AgNP compared to plain PMMA or PMMA loaded with gentamicin. There was no decrease in cell number, viability and osteogenic differentiation and no induction of cell stress for all three PMMA variants after 21 days. Addition of gentamicin to AgNP-loaded PMMA led to a slight decrease in osteogenic differentiation. Also an increase in cell stress was detectable for PMMA loaded with gentamicin and AgNP. In conclusion, supplementation of PMMA bone cement with gentamicin, AgNP, and both results in bone implants with an antibacterial potency and suitable cytocompatibility in MSCs and MSC-OM."

In this work we have characterized the soluble (defined as soluble in Tris-buffered saline after ultracentrifugation) Abeta, obtained from hippocampal samples of Braak II, Braak III–IV and Braak V–VI patients. Although the content of both Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides displayed significant increase with pathology progression, our results demonstrated the presence of low, pg/µg protein, amount of both peptides. This low content could explain the absence (or below detection limits) of soluble Abeta peptides detected by western blots or by immunoprecipitation-western blot analysis. These data were in clear contrast to those published recently by different groups. Aiming to explain the reasons that determine these substantial differences, we also investigated whether the initial homogenization could mobilize Abeta from plaques, using 12-month-old PS1xAPP cortical samples. Our data demonstrated that manual homogenization (using Dounce) preserved the integrity of Abeta plaques whereas strong homogenization procedures (such as sonication) produced a vast redistribution of the Abeta species in all soluble and insoluble fractions. This artifact could explain the dissimilar and somehow controversial data between different groups analyzing human AD samples."
https://openalex.org/W1976427643,"Background Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that invades and replicates within alveolar macrophages through injection of ∼300 effector proteins by its Dot/Icm type IV translocation apparatus. The bona fide F-box protein, AnkB, is a nutritional virulence effector that triggers macrophages to generate a surplus of amino acids, which is essential for intravacuolar proliferation. Therefore, the ankB mutant represents a novel genetic tool to determine the transcriptional response of human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) to actively replicating L. pneumophila. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we utilized total human gene microarrays to determine the global transcriptional response of hMDMs to infection by wild type or the ankB mutant of L. pneumophila. The transcriptomes of hMDMs infected with either actively proliferating wild type or non-replicative ankB mutant bacteria were remarkably similar. The transcriptome of infected hMDMs was predominated by up-regulation of inflammatory pathways (IL-10 anti-inflammatory, interferon signaling and amphoterin signaling), anti-apoptosis, and down-regulation of protein synthesis pathways. In addition, L. pneumophila modulated diverse metabolic pathways, particularly those associated with bio-active lipid metabolism, and SLC amino acid transporters expression. Conclusion/Significance Taken together, the hMDM transcriptional response to L. pneumophila is independent of intra-vacuolar replication of the bacteria and primarily involves modulation of the immune response and metabolic as well as nutritional pathways."

Patients with previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) were excluded from the study. Patients were classified as non-DM (HbA1c<5.7% and no previous evidence of 2 or more fasting blood glucose> = 126 mg/dL), prediabetes (HbA1c from 5.7% to 6.4%), and new suspected DM (HbA1c> = 6.5% independently of current blood glucose). Medical charts from hospital discharge to July 2014 of all suspected DM patients were reviewed to confirm the DM diagnosis.The initial cohort included 1283 patients, of which 393 were excluded because of previous DM diagnosis and 136 because HbA1c during acute stroke phase was not available. No demographic differences were observed between patients with and without HbA1c determinations. The final cohort was composed of 754 patients with first-ever IS and unknown DM history. HbA1c determination suggested new DM in 87 cases (11.5%) and detected 273 patients with prediabetes (36.2%). New DM cases were identified in all etiological stroke subtypes. After discharge, DM diagnosis was confirmed in 80.2% of patients with available follow-up.HbA1c determination detected both undiagnosed DM and prediabetes in IS patients without taking into account the blood glucose values during admission, and independently of etiological stroke subtype. HbA1c determination should be included in the systematic screening of all IS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2090186882,"In the present study, we explored the expression and correlation of survivin with HIF-1α, TGF-β1 and TFE3 in adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC). The expression of survivin, HIF-1α, TGF-β1 and TFE3 was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray containing tissue samples of normal salivary gland (NSG), pleomorphic adenoma (PA) and AdCC. Correlation analysis of these proteins revealed that increased survivin expression was associated with the overexpression of HIF-1α (P<0.001, r = 0.5599), TGF-β1 (P<0.001, r = 0.6616) and TFE3 (P<0.001, r = 0.7747). The expression of survivin, HIF-1α, TGF-β1 and TFE3 was not correlated with the pathological type of human AdCC (P>0.05). Selective inhibition of survivin by YM155 and siRNA significantly reduced human SACC-83 cell proliferation, with the corresponding decrease in expression of HIF-1α, TGF-β1 and TFE3. The data indicate that the overexpression of survivin in AdCC is related to HIF-1α, TGF-β1 and TFE3. We hypothesize from these findings that the inhibition of survivin may be a novel strategy for neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic and radiosensitive treatment of AdCC."
https://openalex.org/W2093931286,"It is well documented that people would remunerate fair behaviours and penalize unfair behaviours. It is argued that individuals' reactions following the receipt of a gift depend on the perceived intentions of the donors. Fair intentions should prompt positive affect, like gratitude, triggering cooperative behaviours; while intended unfairness should trigger negative affect, like anger, fostering anti-social actions. It is, however, contended that when people lack information to infer others' intention they may use 'normative' beliefs about fairness - what a typical fair individual 'should' do in these circumstances - to guide their behaviour. In this experiment we examined this assertion. We had 122 participants play a one-shot, double-anonymous game with half playing as potential helpers (P1s) and half as recipients (P2s). Whether a participant was a P1 or P2 was chance-determined and all participants knew this. P1s decided whether to help P2s and whether to make their help unconditional (no repayment needed) or conditional (full or 'taxed' repayment). P2s decided whether to accept the offer and whatever conditions attached but were blind to the list of helping options available to P1s. We anticipated that recipients would refer to the 'injunctive norm' that 'fair people should help ""for free"" when it is only by chance that they are in a position to help'. Therefore, without knowing P1s' different helping options, unconditional offers should be rated by recipients as fairer than conditional offers, and this should be linked to greater gratitude with greater gratitude linked to greater reciprocation. Path analyses confirmed this serial mediation. The results showed that recipients of unconditional offers, compared to conditional ones, interpreted the helpers' motives as more helpful, experienced greater gratitude and were more eager to reciprocate. The behavioural data further revealed that, when given a latter option to default, 38% of recipients of conditional offers did so."
https://openalex.org/W2040385727,"The inhibition of serum glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK-1) has been found to decrease growth of colon and prostate cancer cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of SGK-1 inhibition in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).Human head and neck tumors (HTB41/43) were established in athymic mice. Growth rates between mice treated with vehicle (PBS) injection (group 1, n = 5), SGK-1 Inhibitor GSK 650394 (group 2, n = 6), systemic cisplatin (group 3, n = 6), and a combination of SGK-1 Inhibitor and cisplatin (group 4, n = 6) were compared using repeated measures one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Tumor cells were subsequently submitted to further analyses.At the end of the experiment mean tumor sizes were 122.33+/-105.86, 76.73+/-36.09, 94.52+/-75.92, and 25.76+/-14.89 mm2 (mean +/- SD) for groups 1 to 4. Groups 2 and 3 showed decreased tumor growth compared to controls (p<0.001). Group 4 displayed even greater growth suppression (p<0.0001). Importantly, group 4 fared better than group 3 (p<0.001). CD44 expression was reduced in group 2 (p<0.05), and to an even greater extent in groups 3 and 4 (p<0.0025). A trend towards reduction of HER 2 expression was noted in group 4.SGK-1 inhibition suppresses tumor growth, and in combination with systemic cisplatin exceeds the effect of cisplatin alone. Decreased expression of CD44 and HER 2 implies depletion of tumor stem cells, and less tumorigenicity. SGK-1 inhibition represents a potential modality of local control for palliation in advanced cases."
https://openalex.org/W2013371747,"Classical signal detection theory attributes bias in perceptual decisions to a threshold criterion, against which sensory excitation is compared. The optimal criterion setting depends on the signal level, which may vary over time, and about which the subject is naïve. Consequently, the subject must optimise its threshold by responding appropriately to feedback. Here a series of experiments was conducted, and a computational model applied, to determine how the decision bias of the ferret in an auditory signal detection task tracks changes in the stimulus level. The time scales of criterion dynamics were investigated by means of a yes-no signal-in-noise detection task, in which trials were grouped into blocks that alternately contained easy- and hard-to-detect signals. The responses of the ferrets implied both long- and short-term criterion dynamics. The animals exhibited a bias in favour of responding ""yes"" during blocks of harder trials, and vice versa. Moreover, the outcome of each single trial had a strong influence on the decision at the next trial. We demonstrate that the single-trial and block-level changes in bias are a manifestation of the same criterion update policy by fitting a model, in which the criterion is shifted by fixed amounts according to the outcome of the previous trial and decays strongly towards a resting value. The apparent block-level stabilisation of bias arises as the probabilities of outcomes and shifts on single trials mutually interact to establish equilibrium. To gain an intuition into how stable criterion distributions arise from specific parameter sets we develop a Markov model which accounts for the dynamic effects of criterion shifts. Our approach provides a framework for investigating the dynamics of decisions at different timescales in other species (e.g., humans) and in other psychological domains (e.g., vision, memory)."
https://openalex.org/W2083366281,"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii fox1 gene encodes a ferroxidase that is involved in cellular Fe uptake and highly induced during Fe deficient conditions. In an effort to identify fox1 promoter regulatory elements, an insertional library was generated in a transgenic Chlamydomonas strain (2A38) harboring an arylsulfatase (ARS) reporter gene driven by the fox1 promoter. Mutants with a defective response to low iron conditions were selected for further study. Among these, a strain containing a disrupted femu2 gene was identified. Activation of the fox1 promoter by the femu2 gene product was confirmed by silencing the femu2 gene using RNA interference. In three femu2 RNAi transgenic lines (IR3, IR6, and IR7), ARS reporter gene activities declined by 84.3%, 86.4%, and 88.8%, respectively under Fe deficient conditions. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis of both the femu2 mutant and the RNAi transgenic lines showed significantly decreased transcript abundance of the endogenous fox1 gene under Fe deficient conditions. Amino acid sequence analysis of the femu2 gene product identified three potential C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) motifs and a nuclear localization study suggests that FEMU2 is localized to the nucleus. In addition, a potential FEMU2 binding site ((G/T)TTGG(G/T)(G/T)T) was identified using PCR-mediated random binding site selection. Taken together, this evidence suggests that FEMU2 is involved in up-regulation of the fox1 gene in Fe deficient cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967952526,"Plant growth regulators, such as hormones and their respective biosynthesis inhibitors, are effective tools to elucidate the physiological function of phytohormones in plants. A problem of chemical treatments, however, is the potential for interaction of the active compound with the growth media substrate. We studied the interaction and efficacy of propiconazole, a potent and specific inhibitor of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, with common soilless greenhouse growth media for rice, sorghum, and maize. Many of the tested growth media interacted with propiconazole reducing its efficacy up to a hundred fold. To determine the molecular interaction of inhibitors with media substrates, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and sorption isotherm analysis was applied. While mica clay substrates absorbed up to 1.3 mg of propiconazole per g substrate, calcined clays bound up to 12 mg of propiconazole per g substrate. The efficacy of the gibberellic acid biosynthesis inhibitor, uniconazole, and the most active brassinosteroid, brassinolide, was impacted similarly by the respective substrates. Conversely, gibberellic acid showed no distinct growth response in different media. Our results suggest that the reduction in efficacy of propiconazole, uniconazole, and brassinolide in bioassays when grown in calcined clay is caused by hydrophobic interactions between the plant growth regulators and the growth media. This was further confirmed by experiments using methanol-water solvent mixes with higher hydrophobicity values, which reduce the interaction of propiconazole and calcined clay."
https://openalex.org/W2110091332,"In this study we describe the molecular and cellular characterization of a zebrafish mutant that develops tumors in the optic pathway. Heterozygous Tg(flk1:RFP)is18 transgenic adults develop tumors of the retina, optic nerve and optic tract. Molecular and genetic mapping demonstrate the tumor phenotype is linked to a high copy number transgene array integrated in the lincRNA gene lincRNAis18/Zv9_00007276 on chromosome 3. TALENs were used to isolate a 147kb deletion allele that removes exons 2–5 of the lincRNAis18 gene. Deletion allele homozygotes are viable and do not develop tumors, indicating loss of function of the lincRNAis18 locus is not the trigger for tumor onset. Optic pathway tumors in the Tg(flk1:RFP)is18 mutant occur with a penetrance of 80–100% by 1 year of age. The retinal tumors are highly vascularized and composed of rosettes of various sizes embedded in a fibrous matrix. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased expression of the glial markers GFAP and BLBP throughout retinal tumors and in dysplastic optic nerve. We performed transcriptome analysis of pre-tumorous retina and retinal tumor tissue and found changes in gene expression signatures of radial glia and astrocytes (slc1a3), activated glia (atf3, blbp, apoeb), proliferating neural progenitors (foxd3, nestin, cdh2, her9/hes1), and glioma markers (S100β, vim). The transcriptome also revealed activation of cAMP, Stat3 and Wnt signal transduction pathways. qRT-PCR confirmed >10-fold overexpression of the Wnt pathway components hbegfa, ascl1a, and insm1a. Together the data indicate Müller glia and/or astrocyte-derived progenitors could contribute to the zebrafish Tg(flk1:RFP)is18 optic pathway tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1966753639,"Large scale patterns of ecologically relevant traits may help identify drivers of their variability and conditions beneficial or adverse to the expression of these traits. Antimicrofouling defenses in scleractinian corals regulate the establishment of the associated biofilm as well as the risks of infection. The Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast features a pronounced thermal and nutritional gradient including regions and seasons with potentially stressful conditions to corals. Assessing the patterns of antimicrofouling defenses across the Red Sea may hint at the susceptibility of corals to global change. We investigated microfouling pressure as well as the relative strength of 2 alternative antimicrofouling defenses (chemical antisettlement activity, mucus release) along the pronounced environmental gradient along the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast in 2 successive years. Microfouling pressure was exceptionally low along most of the coast but sharply increased at the southernmost sites. Mucus release correlated with temperature. Chemical defense tended to anti-correlate with mucus release. As a result, the combined action of mucus release and chemical antimicrofouling defense seemed to warrant sufficient defense against microbes along the entire coast. In the future, however, we expect enhanced energetic strain on corals when warming and/or eutrophication lead to higher bacterial fouling pressure and a shift towards putatively more costly defense by mucus release."
