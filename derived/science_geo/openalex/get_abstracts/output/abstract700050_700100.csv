https://openalex.org/W4294636902,"Cardiac symptoms are increasingly recognized as late complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in previously well individuals with mild initial illness, but the underlying pathophysiology leading to long-term cardiac symptoms remains unclear. In this study, we conducted serial cardiac assessments in a selected population of individuals with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with no previous cardiac disease or notable comorbidities by measuring blood biomarkers of heart injury or dysfunction and by performing magnetic resonance imaging. Baseline measurements from 346 individuals with COVID-19 (52% females) were obtained at a median of 109 days (interquartile range (IQR), 77-177 days) after infection, when 73% of participants reported cardiac symptoms, such as exertional dyspnea (62%), palpitations (28%), atypical chest pain (27%) and syncope (3%). Symptomatic individuals had higher heart rates and higher imaging values or contrast agent accumulation, denoting inflammatory cardiac involvement, compared to asymptomatic individuals. Structural heart disease or high levels of biomarkers of cardiac injury or dysfunction were rare in symptomatic individuals. At follow-up (329 days (IQR, 274-383 days) after infection), 57% of participants had persistent cardiac symptoms. Diffuse myocardial edema was more pronounced in participants who remained symptomatic at follow-up as compared to those who improved. Female gender and diffuse myocardial involvement on baseline imaging independently predicted the presence of cardiac symptoms at follow-up. Ongoing inflammatory cardiac involvement may, at least in part, explain the lingering cardiac symptoms in previously well individuals with mild initial COVID-19 illness."

Dysfunctional astrocytes may contribute to disease and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) can be protective. Here we show that human neural progenitor cells transduced with GDNF (CNS10-NPC-GDNF) differentiated to astrocytes protected spinal motor neurons and were safe in animal models. CNS10-NPC-GDNF were transplanted unilaterally into the lumbar spinal cord of 18 ALS participants in a phase 1/2a study (NCT02943850). The primary endpoint of safety at 1 year was met, with no negative effect of the transplant on motor function in the treated leg compared with the untreated leg. Tissue analysis of 13 participants who died of disease progression showed graft survival and GDNF production. Benign neuromas near delivery sites were common incidental findings at post-mortem. This study shows that one administration of engineered neural progenitors can provide new support cells and GDNF delivery to the ALS patient spinal cord for up to 42 months post-transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W4294277371,"The supercoiling of bacterial and archaeal flagellar filaments is required for motility. Archaeal flagellar filaments have no homology to their bacterial counterparts and are instead homologs of bacterial type IV pili. How these prokaryotic flagellar filaments, each composed of thousands of copies of identical subunits, can form stable supercoils under torsional stress is a fascinating puzzle for which structural insights have been elusive. Advances in cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) make it now possible to directly visualize the basis for supercoiling, and here, we show the atomic structures of supercoiled bacterial and archaeal flagellar filaments. For the bacterial flagellar filament, we identify 11 distinct protofilament conformations with three broad classes of inter-protomer interface. For the archaeal flagellar filament, 10 protofilaments form a supercoil geometry supported by 10 distinct conformations, with one inter-protomer discontinuity creating a seam inside of the curve. Our results suggest that convergent evolution has yielded stable superhelical geometries that enable microbial locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W4294636858,"Here we present an approach that combines a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system that simultaneously targets hundreds of epigenetically diverse endogenous genomic sites with high-throughput sequencing to measure Cas9 dynamics and cellular responses at scale. This massive multiplexing of CRISPR is enabled by means of multi-target guide RNAs (mgRNAs), degenerate guide RNAs that direct Cas9 to a pre-determined number of well-mapped sites. mgRNAs uncovered generalizable insights into Cas9 binding and cleavage, revealing rapid post-cleavage Cas9 departure and repair factor loading at protospacer adjacent motif-proximal genomic DNA. Moreover, by bypassing confounding effects from guide RNA sequence, mgRNAs unveiled that Cas9 binding is enhanced at chromatin-accessible regions, and cleavage by bound Cas9 is more efficient near transcribed regions. Combined with light-mediated activation and deactivation of Cas9 activity, mgRNAs further enabled high-throughput study of the cellular response to double-strand breaks with high temporal resolution, revealing the presence, extent (under 2 kb) and kinetics (~1 h) of reversible DNA damage-induced chromatin decompaction. Altogether, this work establishes mgRNAs as a generalizable platform for multiplexing CRISPR and advances our understanding of intracellular Cas9 activity and the DNA damage response at endogenous loci."
https://openalex.org/W4294843719,"The maturity and growth of social media have empowered online customers to generate electronic word of mouth (eWOM), on various online websites and platforms, which may influence an individual’s decision-making process. This paper explores eWOM information’s impact on social media users’ purchase intention by applying the information adoption model (IAM) and the technology acceptance model (TAM). PLS-SEM (SmartPLS V.3.3) has been utilized to test the hypotheses using data of 432 respondents. The research findings evinced that eWOM information quality, credibility, usefulness, and ease of use have been critical in determining online consumers’ intention to adopt eWOM and form purchase behavior on social media. The study’s outcomes offer the marketing managers a viewpoint to realize the significance of the effect of eWOM information on online purchase intention among social media users. Furthermore, the study findings will also enlighten marketing and business managers to utilize social media websites by gauging consumer behavior and focusing on characteristics of eWOM information on social media for better consumer insights."

https://openalex.org/W4294549719,"Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive bacillus, which is a frequent cause of gastrointestinal infections triggered by the depletion of the gut microbiome. Because of the frequent recurrence of these infections after antibiotic treatment, mechanisms of C. difficile persistence and recurrence, including biofilm formation, are of increasing interest. Previously, our group and others found that type IV pili, filamentous helical appendages polymerized from protein subunits, promoted microcolony and biofilm formation in C. difficile. In Gram-negative bacteria, the ability of type IV pili to mediate bacterial self-association has been explained through interactions between the pili of adjacent cells, but type IV pili from several Gram-negative species are also required for natural competence through DNA uptake. Here, we report the ability of two C. difficile pilin subunits, PilJ and PilW, to bind to DNA in vitro, as well as the defects in biofilm formation in the pilJ and pilW gene-interruption mutants. Additionally, we have resolved the X-ray crystal structure of PilW, which we use to model possible structural mechanisms for the formation of C. difficile biofilm through interactions between type IV pili and the DNA of the extracellular matrix. Taken together, our results provide further insight into the relationship between type IV pilus function and biofilm formation in C. difficile and, more broadly, suggest that DNA recognition by type IV pili and related structures may have functional importance beyond DNA uptake for natural competence.

Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacillus, which is a common cause of gastrointestinal infections, particularly after the use of oral antibiotics or other treatments which reduce the diversity of the gut microbiome (1Leffler D.A. Lamont J.T. Clostridium difficile infection.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372: 1539-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). These infections are treatable with one of several oral antibiotic treatments, but in 20 to 30% of cases, the infection reappears after the cessation of antibiotic treatment (2Zanella Terrier M.C.

Colon Rectal Surg. 2015; 28: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed for this recurrence, including the possibility of a reservoir of C. difficile biofilm which persists through the course of antibiotics (4Meza-Torres J. Auria E.

Notably, this same pattern of recurrence has been observed for other bacterial infections in which the pathogen is known to form biofilm, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections which form biofilms in the lung (6Reynolds D.

The formation of C. difficile biofilms in vitro is typically studied in monoculture, but in vivo, interactions with other bacterial species, either pathogens or commensal members of the gut microbiome, may play an important role (14Slater R.T.

Here, we have tested the hypothesis that interactions between C. difficile T4P and extracellular DNA contribute to biofilm formation by measuring the ability of recombinantly expressed C. difficile T4P subunits to bind DNA. We have found that two pilin subunits, PilJ and PilW, bind DNA in vitro. Based on these results, we have measured the ability of gene-interruption mutants of pilJ and pilW to form bacterial biofilms and resolved the x-ray crystal structure of PilW to probe the mechanisms by which these subunits adhere to DNA and how these structurally distinct proteins are incorporated into the pilus fiber. Although T4P are primarily composed of single subunit, all known T4P systems encode genes for multiple protein subunits (30Giltner C.L. Nguyen Y. Burrows L.L.

In the UK epidemic strain R20291, the primary C. difficile T4P operon includes all genes, which have been identified as necessary for pilus polymerization, including an extension ATPase (pilB1), as well as four pilin genes, including pilA1 (the major subunit). Two other pilin gene clusters contain a total of three pilin genes and a further two, pilJ and pilW can be identified outside of any such gene cluster (31Melville S. Craig L.

https://openalex.org/W4294795809,"Entomopathogenic fungi can adopt an endophytic lifestyle and provide protection against insect herbivores and plant pathogens. So far, most studies have focused on Beauveria bassiana to increase plant resistance against abiotic and biotic stresses, while only little is known for other entomopathogenic fungi. In this study, we investigated whether root inoculation of sweet pepper ( Capsicum annuum L.) by the entomopathogenic fungi Akanthomyces muscarius ARSEF 5128 and B . bassiana ARSEF 3097 can improve resistance against the tobacco peach aphid Myzus persicae var. nicotianae . First, dual-choice experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that the fungi deter aphids via modifying plant volatile profiles. Next, we tested the hypothesis that endophytic colonization negatively affects aphid life history traits, such as fecundity, development and mortality rate. Aphids were significantly attracted to the odor of plants inoculated with A . muscarius over non-inoculated plants. Plants inoculated with A . muscarius emitted significantly higher amounts of β-pinene than non-inoculated plants, and significantly higher amounts of indole than B . bassiana- inoculated and non-inoculated plants. Inoculation with the fungal strains also caused significantly higher emission of terpinolene. Further, both aphid longevity and fecundity were significantly reduced by 18% and 10%, respectively, when feeding on plants inoculated with A . muscarius , although intrinsic rate of population increase did not differ between inoculated and non-inoculated plants. Sweet pepper plants inoculated with B . bassiana ARSEF 3097 did not elicit a significant behavioral response nor affected the investigated life history traits. We conclude that endophytic colonization by entomopathogenic fungi has the potential to alter olfactory behavior and performance of M . persicae var. nicotianae , but effects are small and depend on the fungal strain used."
https://openalex.org/W4294579002,"Abstract Zinc finger protein 154 (ZNF154) is hypermethylated at the promoter in many epithelial-derived solid tumors. However, its methylation status and function in esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC) are poorly understood. We found that the ZNF154 promoter is hypermethylated in ESCC and portends poor prognosis. In addition, ZNF154 functions as a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in ESCC, and is downregulated by promoter hypermethylation. We established a targeted demethylation strategy based on CRISPR/dCas9 technology and found that the hypermethylation of ZNF154 promoter repressed ZNF154 induction, which in turn promoted the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally, high-throughput CUT&amp;Tag analysis, GEPIA software and qPCR were used to revealed the role of ZNF154 as a transcription factor to upregulate the expression of ESCC-associated tumor suppressor genes. Taken together, hypermethylation of the ZNF154 promoter plays an important role in the development of ESCC, and epigenetic editing is a promising tool for inhibiting ESCC cells with aberrant DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W4294549757,"Pore-forming proteins perforate lipid membranes and consequently affect their integrity and cell fitness. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of these proteins from bacteria, fungi, or certain animals act as toxins. While pore-forming proteins have also been found in plants, there is little information about their molecular structure and mode of action. Bryoporin is a protein from the moss Physcomitrium patens, and its corresponding gene was found to be upregulated by various abiotic stresses, especially dehydration, as well as upon fungal infection. Based on the amino acid sequence, it was suggested that bryoporin was related to the actinoporin family of pore-forming proteins, originally discovered in sea anemones. Here, we provide the first detailed structural and functional analysis of this plant cytolysin. The crystal structure of monomeric bryoporin is highly similar to those of actinoporins. Our cryo-EM analysis of its pores showed an actinoporin-like octameric structure, thereby revealing a close kinship of proteins from evolutionarily distant organisms. This was further confirmed by our observation of bryoporin's preferential binding to and formation of pores in membranes containing animal sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin and ceramide phosphoethanolamine; however, its binding affinity was weaker than that of actinoporin equinatoxin II. We determined bryoporin did not bind to major sphingolipids found in fungi or plants, and its membrane-binding and pore-forming activity was enhanced by various sterols. Our results suggest that bryoporin could represent a part of the moss defense arsenal, acting as a pore-forming toxin against membranes of potential animal pathogens, parasites, or predators."

Seq’ing the origins of cells in the developing spinal cordJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 298Issue 11PreviewIn the developing central nervous system, neurogenesis precedes gliogenesis; however, when and how progenitors are specified for a neuronal versus glial fate and the temporal regulation of this process is unclear. Progenitors within the motor neuron progenitor domain in the developing spinal cord give rise to cholinergic motor neurons and cells of the oligodendroglial lineage sequentially. In a recent study, Xing et al. used single cell RNA-seq to identify previously unknown heterogeneity of these progenitors in zebrafish and to delineate the trajectories that distinct pools of these progenitors take. Full-Text PDF Open Access A detailed analysis of the types of cells in the developing central nervous system (CNS), especially neural stem cells/progenitors, will reveal how these cells are generated, assist in elucidating the pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders, and suggest ways to direct them to target specific cell types for disease treatment. In development, neural progenitors have potential to generate neurons and glia, which is the basis of complexity in the CNS. In the spinal cord, both motor neurons and oligodendrocytes arise from the pMN domain; progenitors in this domain are defined by the gene marker olig2 and sequentially form motor neurons and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). This process is highly regulated by a series of transcription factors. Neurogenin1 and Neurogenin2 are upregulated preceding neurogenesis but downregulated in oligodendrogenesis (1Mizuguchi R. Sugimori M. Takebayashi H. Kosako H. Nagao M.

Olig2 and Nkx2.2 together promote generation of the OPC lineage (2Zhou Q. Choi G. Anderson D.J. The bHLH transcription factor Olig2 promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation in collaboration with Nkx2.2.Neuron. 2001; 31: 791-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Though multiple studies have revealed several key factors in the development of motor neurons and OPCs, the fates and transcriptional signatures of progenitors are not fully understood. In addition, the developmental lineages of motor neurons and OPCs are controversial (3Ravanelli A.M. Appel B. Motor neurons and oligodendrocytes arise from distinct cell lineages by progenitor recruitment.Genes Dev. 2015; 29: 2504-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For example, individual progenitors grown in culture or traced by recombinant retroviral infection or fluorescent dye can generate both neurons and glia in flies, mice, or zebrafish (4Schmid A.

Spatial and temporal regulation of ventral spinal cord precursor specification by Hedgehog signaling.Development. 2004; 131: 5959-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, clonal lineage testing and live imaging reveal that subsets of progenitors are fate-restricted, forming either motor neurons or glial cells in mice or zebrafish (3Ravanelli A.M. Appel B.

In addition, though not as commonly mentioned as motor neurons and oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and interneurons are also observed in the clones from the pMN progenitors (7Park H.C. Shin J. Appel B.

These findings from tissue transplantation, lineage tracing, or cell ablation have been heavily based on reporter genes, the non-specificity of which makes it difficult to generate a model that fits the data, resulting in incomplete characterization of molecular regulators. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach offers a high resolution method to decipher the molecular programs driving the transition of neural fates. Recent studies have used large-scale profiling of single cells in zebrafish (10Wagner D.E. Weinreb C. Collins Z.M. Briggs J.A. Megason S.G. Klein A.M.

Shekhar K. Regev A. Schier A.F. Single-cell reconstruction of developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis.Science. 2018; 360eaar3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), but these studies focus on early embryogenesis, before most glial cells are specified. Here, we applied the scRNA-seq technique to sequence 24,646 cells in zebrafish ventral spinal cords at 28 hpf (hour post fertilization), 42 hpf, and 60 hpf, identify temporal lineages, and decode the transcriptome landscapes for progenitor fate transitions. Our study reveals the heterogeneity of olig2+ progenitor cells, which not only include the known pMN progenitors for the motor neuron and OPC lineages but also two distinct neural progenitor populations for interneurons and a second lineage of motor neurons. We also deciphered critical molecules for neural progenitor fate transitions and demonstrate that myt1 (Myelin Transcription Factor 1) is necessary for motor neuron development and that lbr (lamin B receptor) is necessary for the maintenance of neural progenitor cell stemness. Interestingly, the myt1 mutant does not lead to a deficiency in the OPC lineage, indicating that signals from early formed motor neurons are not obligatory for the development of the OPC lineage. Lbr is important for the maintenance of neural stem/progenitor cell stemness. Our study unveils molecular signatures of pMN progenitors, deciphers their novel molecular programming, and suggests approaches for multiple applications, including stem cell transplantation as well as directed cell differentiation or reprogramming. Notably, we also have established open web-based datasets for researchers to access. Progenitors in the ventral spinal cords (pMN domains) of zebrafish initiate differentiation into motor neurons prior to 24 hpf, and motor neuron generation is largely accomplished by 48 to 51 hpf (12Reimer M.M. Norris A. Ohnmacht J. Patani R. Zhong Z. Dias T.B. et al.Dopamine from the brain promotes spinal motor neuron generation during development and adult regeneration.Dev. Cell. 2013; 25: 478-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). At 36 hpf, sox10 and nkx2.2 positive cells (OPC lineage cells) have been observed (13Mathews E.S. Appel B. Oligodendrocyte differentiation.Methods Cell Biol. 2016; 134: 69-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this transgenic Tg(olig2:dsRed), the olig2 regulatory element controls the expression of dsRed, which labels progenitors expressing olig2 and their progeny with transient preservation of fluorescent protein from their progenitors (14Shin J. Park H.-C. Topczewska J.M. Mawdsley D.J. Appel B. Neural cell fate analysis in zebrafish using olig2 BAC transgenics.Methods Cell Sci. 2003; 25: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To identify the transcriptome profiles in pMN progenitors and their offspring, we applied fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to specifically sort cells labeled by the transgenic line Tg(olig2:dsRed) at 28 hpf, 42 hpf, and 60 hpf, stages when active motor neuron development, OPC specification, and differentiation were occurring. To specifically identify progenitors and their offspring in the spinal cords, we only retained the fish trunks for single cell isolation (Fig. 1A). Approximately, 200 fish trunks at each time point were collected to minimize individual variation. Altogether, we transcriptionally profiled 24,646 high-quality cells with the high-throughput single-cell system 10× Genomics (15Zheng G.X. Terry J.M. Belgrader P. Ryvkin P. Bent Z.W. Wilson R. et al.Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). A median of 4912 UMI counts and 1646 genes were detected (Fig. S1, A–D). This depth is comparable to similar studies (15Zheng G.X. Terry J.M. Belgrader P. Ryvkin P. Bent Z.W. Wilson R. et al.Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Sorted cells were classified based on their gene expression pattern. RNA-seq expression patterns were projected into UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, for cell population annotation (16Becht E. McInnes L. Healy J. Dutertre C.A. Kwok I.W.H. Ng L.G. et al.Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 37: 38-44Crossref Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Altogether, 12 distinct cell clusters were identified (Fig. 1B). By combining known gene markers and transcriptionally unique signatures (Fig. 1C and Supplemental Data 1), we defined these cells: pMN progenitors, motor neurons, radial glia, OPC, and interneurons. pMN progenitors were defined by their expression of olig2 and nestin (7Park H.C. Shin J. Appel B. Spatial and temporal regulation of ventral spinal cord precursor specification by Hedgehog signaling.Development. 2004; 131: 5959-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Motor neurons were enriched for mnx2a, mnx2b, mnx1, lhx3, or isl1 (17Seredick S.D. Ryswyk L.V. Hutchinson S.A. Eisen J.S. Zebrafish Mnx proteins specify one motoneuron subtype and suppress acquisition of interneuron characteristics.Neural Dev. 2012; 7: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Radial glia were defined by fabp7 and gfap (18Lange C. Rost F. Machate A. Reinhardt S. Lesche M. Weber A. et al.Single cell sequencing of radial glia progeny reveals the diversity of newborn neurons in the adult zebrafish brain.Development. 2020; 147dev185595Google Scholar).

These results were in line with the cell types labeled by this transgenic line in previous work (22Takada N. Appel B. Identification of genes expressed by zebrafish oligodendrocytes using a differential microarray screen.Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 2041-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), confirming the reliability of our sequencing data. Cell clustering analysis at 28 hpf, 42 hpf, and 60 hpf revealed an overlap between most annotated cells (Fig. 1, D–F). For example, clusters pMN_1 and pMN_2 exist in all three time points. However, the percentages of cell components changed dramatically (Fig. 1G). The fractions of motor neuron_1 significantly increased from 28 hpf to 60 hpf. OPCs were barely observable at 28 hpf, but greatly expanded at 42 hpf, and accumulated even more by 60 hpf. In contrast, pMN_1 and pMN_2 gradually decreased with time. These data indicate a rapid transition to differentiation. To probe the potential relationships between the cells isolated by FACS, we performed partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) analysis (23Wolf F.A. Angerer P. Theis F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis.Genome Biol. 2018; 19: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar), which showed the topography and lineage of the cell clusters (Fig. 2A). The motor neurons and OPCs branched from the pMN progenitors. To better understand the transition, we characterized the cellular heterogeneity and features of the progenitors involved in these two lineages (including Clusters 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11). Markers including nes (nestin), hes6, and btg2 were used to identify progenitors, in which four populations (Clusters 1, 2, 6, 11) stood out (Fig. 2B). Proliferation markers, such as pcna, cdk1, and mki67, were all highly enriched in Cluster 6, indicating these were cycling progenitors (Fig. 2B). Cluster 2 was expressed with neuronal markers, such as isl1 and neurod4, as well as multiple progenitor markers, including nes and hes6, indicating these were primitive motor neurons (pri-MNs). A subpopulation in 11 was denoted as OPCs, as it was enriched for sox10 and nkx2.2a (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, progenitor markers, including hes6, btg2, ppp1r14bb, ascl1a, sox2, nes, sox6, ppp1r14ab, and sox13, were differentially expressed in the four populations (Clusters 1, 2, 6, and 11). btg2 was enriched in pMN_1 but was significantly decreased in the pri-MNs and OPCs; hes6 and nes had the highest expression in the pri-MNs; ppp1r14bb, sox2, and sox6 were mainly enriched in the OPCs, but ascl1a and nes were barely observable in this population (Fig. 2B). In the cell cluster OPC/OL, we observed some cells expressing mbpb, a mature oligodendrocyte marker, indicating that this cluster was a mixture of OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes (Fig. S2A). Trajectory inference analysis revealed the nature of the transition from OPCs to oligodendrocytes (Fig. S2, B–D). Consistently, genes in this subcluster with mbpb expression were enriched in myelination and cytoskeleton organization (Fig. S2E). Go term analysis of marker genes reveals the developmental features in each subpopulation: for example, Cluster_1 (pMN_1) was enriched in tissue development and nervous system development. Cluster_2 (pri-MN) was enriched in nervous system development and neuron fate specification; Cluster_6 (pMN_2) was enriched in the cell cycle. Consistently, they were in concert with cell structural and morphological alterations. For example, Cluster_1 (pMN_1) was enriched in the anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis, Cluster 2 (pri-MN) was enriched in the cell projection assembly, and Cluster_11 (OPC) was enriched in the actin cytoskeleton organization (Fig. S3, A–D). Notably, highly expressed genes in each population were also enriched in distinct metabolic pathways. For example, Cluster 1 (pMN_1) was enriched in the regulation of biosynthetic processes, Cluster 2 (pri-MN) was enriched in the regulation of nucleobase-containing compound metabolic processes, Cluster 6 (pMN_2) was enriched in the regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic processes and the hydrogen peroxide catabolic processes, and Cluster 11 (OPC) was enriched in cellular component biogenesis and also in the generation of precursor metabolites and energy (Fig. S3, A–D). This evidence supports the massive energy and biosynthetic demands required for the cell cycle and differentiation. These four clusters can also be clearly defined by the genes involved in metabolic pathways and morphological alterations (Supplemental Data 3 and Fig. S3, E and F). Therefore, pMN progenitors or precursors for the motor neuron and OPC lineages were featured with distinct progenitor markers, developmental pathways, and metabolic pathways. Interestingly, the UMAP plot reveals a small subpopulation in pMN_1 (Fig. 2C), which was enriched in progenitor markers, including lin28a and hmgn2, but with little expression of nkx2.2a and sox10 (Fig. 2, F–I). This indicates that these are likely pri-OPCs (primitive OPCs). Consistently, pseudotime analysis revealed the developmental trajectory from pri-OPCs to OPCs (Fig. 2E). This subpopulation was observable at 28 hpf and still retained at 60 hpf (Fig. 2D), suggesting a segregating model of OPC and motor neurons, in which glial fate was restricted prior to cessation of motor neuron generation (24Scott K. O'Rourke R. Winkler C.C. Kearns C.A. Appel B. Temporal single-cell transcriptomes of zebrafish spinal cord pMN progenitors reveal distinct neuronal and glial progenitor populations.Dev. Biol. 2021; 479: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For the motor neuron lineage, we found a dynamic transcriptome change along the trajectory. dlb, insm1b, and neurod4 were highly enriched in this cluster pri-MN but gradually decreased as cell fate was determined (from motor neuron_1 to motor neuron_2). Isl2b and islr2 were enriched in motor neuron_1 but were decreased in motor neuron_2. Tac1 and chga, however, were significantly upregulated in motor neuron_2 (Fig. 2J). In situ hybridization confirmed the expression of insm1a as well as this novel motor neuron marker Tac1 (Fig. 2, L–N). Consistently, the enriched pathways of highly expressed genes switched from neuronal specification to axongenesis and synaptogenesis from pri-MN to motor neuron_1 and motor neuron_2, respectively (Fig. 2K; GO term enrichment and their related genes in each cell cluster were available in Supplemental Data 2). Therefore, sc-RNAseq revealed that both oligodendrocytes and motor neurons underwent a complex molecular developmental transition from intermediate precursors into mature cells. In mammals, radial glia can function as neuroepithelial progenitors in the central nervous system and are the primary sources for neurons and glia (25Jurisch-Yaksi N. Yaksi E. Kizil C. Radial glia in the zebrafish brain: functional, structural, and physiological comparison with the mammalian glia.Glia. 2020; 68: 2451-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, though radial glia have been identified as a major source for neurogenesis after injury in the larval and adult zebrafish (26Briona L.K. Poulain F.E. Mosimann C. Dorsky R.I. Wnt/ß-catenin signaling is required for radial glial neurogenesis following spinal cord injury.Dev. Biol. 2015; 403: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Reimer M.M. Kuscha V. Wyatt C.

Sörensen I. Kuscha V. Frank R.E. Liu C. Becker C.G. et al.Motor neuron regeneration in adult zebrafish.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8510-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the characteristics of radial glia in early development are not well understood. Similar to mammals, radial glia in zebrafish were also enriched in neural progenitor markers, for example, sox2 and hes6, indicating their identity as progenitors in early zebrafish development (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast to pMN progenitors, radial glia were highly enriched with gfap, her4.1, and fabp7, as well as atp1b1a and atp1a1b (Supplemental Data 1 and Fig. 3C). The genes that were differentially expressed in radial glia versus those in pMN_1 or pMN_2 clusters were enriched in focal adhesion and ECM–receptor interactions, providing evidence for marked morphological and functional differences in radial glia (Fig. 3D). Radial glia were further classified into three subclusters (Fig. 3, E and F). Marker genes retrieved in each subcluster revealed that subpopulation 1 was highly enriched with elavl3 and nhlh2, while subpopulation 2, with the highest G2M proliferation score (G2M pathway scores based on G2/M phase markers), was enriched for mki67, nusap1, and aurkb and enriched in the pathways of mitotic cell cycles (Fig. 3, G–I and Supplemental Data 4). The transcriptional profiles and pseudotemporal ordering of subpopulation 0 were in between those of subpopulation 1 and 2 (Fig. 3, G and J). These markers indicate that subpopulation 1 is comprised of neurons, while subpopulation 2 is composed of proliferating radial glia, another source of olig2+ progenitors. The transgenic line Tg(gfap:EGFP) was used to label the nuclei and extended process of radial glia (15Zheng G.X. Terry J.M. Belgrader P. Ryvkin P. Bent Z.W. Wilson R. et al.Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). In this transgenic line Tg(gfap:EGFP; olig2:dsRed), we observed a few dsRed+ cells surrounded by GFP (Fig. 3, P–R), evidence that olig2 is enriched in subpopulations of radial glia (Fig. 3F). Monocle analysis suggests a developmental trajectory from proliferating radial glia to neurons, with subpopulation 2 at the start and subpopulation 1 at the end. Interestingly, subpopulation 1 in the radial glia was enriched for multiple motor neuronal markers, for example, isl1, isl2a, and mnx1 (Fig. 3, K–M and Supplemental Data 4). The SingleR transcriptome profiling analyses (29Aran D. Looney A.P. Liu L. Wu E. Fong V. Hsu A. et al.Reference-based analysis of lung single-cell sequencing reveals a transitional profibrotic macrophage.Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar) revealed significant similarities between subpopulation 1, MN_1, and MN_2, confirming the motor neuronal features of subpopulation 1 (Fig. 3N). Gene expression patterns between subpopulation 1 and motor neurons were highly comparable as shown by heatmaps (Fig. 3O). In the transgenic line Tg(gfap:EGFP), motor neuronal projections from the spinal cord to the periphery were observed (Fig. 3S). Therefore, single cell analysis suggests a distinct lineage of neurons enriched for motor neuronal markers, derived from olig2+ progenitors (radial glia), which is distinct from the previously known OPC/motor neuron lineages. In zebrafish, interneurons have been observed among the progeny of pMN progenitors (7Park H.C. Shin J. Appel B. Spatial and temporal regulation of ventral spinal cord precursor specification by Hedgehog signaling.Development. 2004; 131: 5959-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the lineage relationship between motor neurons, OPCs, and interneurons was unclear. Interestingly, we observed that a rare subpopulation in interneuron_7 was enriched with nes and olig2 instead of sv2 (Fig. 4, A–C), indicating that it is a distinct progenitor population. Lineage trajectory analysis reveals that this subpopulation can develop into mature neurons, a distinguishing feature of which is the expression of sv2 (Fig. 4, D–G). When we analyzed all these progenitors together, we found they share common progenitor genes, including ppp1414bb, hes6, and btg2, confirming the progenitor properties of subpopulation 1 in interneuron_7 (Fig. 4, I–K). However, unlike the pMN_2 and radial glia, subpopulation 1 in interneuron_7 and pMN_1 are not enriched for cycling markers, including pcna, nusap1, and mki67, consistent with their function in neuronal differentiation (Fig. 4, H and L–N). In summary, our single cell analysis revealed the heterogeneity of olig2+ progenitors and their distinct lineages (Fig. S4). pMN progenitors are known as sources for motor neurons and OPCs. In line with this, the trajectory inference analysis software Monocle (30Trapnell C. Cacchiarelli D. Grimsby J. Pokharel P. Li S. Morse M. et al.The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2868) Google Scholar) revealed that the pri-MN and OPC lineages branched from the pMN_1 and pMN_2 clusters (Fig. 5, A–C). Therefore, understanding the molecular programs that underlie the transition from pMN progenitors to the OPC or pri-MN will elucidate more precise cell fate decisions are important for lineage determination. Temporal changes in gene expression for MN and OPC fate determination were identified (top 500 genes were available in Supplemental Data 5). We selected transcription factors among the top genes that biased the fates of pMN progenitors for further analysis (Fig. 5, D and E), based on the critical roles of transcription factors in cell fate determination. For the transcription factors, we observed four distinct gene expression patterns along the MN and OPC trajectories: (1) a pattern of a decrease in the MN but not in the OPC trajectory (Cluster 1); (2) a pattern of a decrease in either the MN or the OPC trajectory (Cluster 2); (3) a pattern of an increase in the OPC trajectory (Cluster 3); (4) a pattern of an increase in the MN trajectory (Cluster 4). Cluster 2 included hmgb2a, her6, and her2, which are known for counteracting cell differentiation programming and maintaining the stemness of neural stem cells or progenitors. Interestingly, genes previously identified as “regeneration-associated genes”, such as junba, atf3, and junbb, were also included in this cluster. This indicates that a complex dedifferentiation and neuron reprogramming process occurs in regeneration. In Cluster 3, transcription factors such as olig1, sox10, and nkx2.2a were included, consistent with their role in OPC lineage determination (Fig. 5, D and E). In Cluster 4, multiple transcription factors known for motor neuron specification, including mnx1, lhx4, isl1, insml1a, insm1b, and neurod1, were identified and defined as “MN transcription factors” (Fig. 5, D and E). These results were largely consistent with the differentially expressed gene (DEG) anal"
https://openalex.org/W4294631614,"Glutamate acts at eight metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor subtypes expressed in a partially overlapping fashion in distinct brain circuits. Recent evidence indicates that specific mGlu receptor protomers can heterodimerize and that these heterodimers can exhibit different pharmacology when compared to their homodimeric counterparts. Group III mGlu agonist-induced suppression of evoked excitatory potentials and induction of long-term potentiation at Schaffer collateral-CA1 (SC-CA1) synapses in the rodent hippocampus can be blocked by the selective mGlu7 negative allosteric modulator (NAM), ADX71743. Curiously, a different mGlu7 NAM, 6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-methyl-3-pyridin-4-ylisoxazonolo[4,5-c]pyridin-4(5H)-one, failed to block these responses in brain slices despite its robust activity at mGlu7 homodimers in vitro. We hypothesized that this might result from heterodimerization of mGlu7 with another mGlu receptor protomer and focused on mGlu8 as a candidate given the reported effects of mGlu8-targeted compounds in the hippocampus. Here, we used complemented donor acceptor-resonance energy transfer to study mGlu7/8 heterodimer activation in vitro and observed that ADX71743 blocked responses of both mGlu7/7 homodimers and mGlu7/8 heterodimers, whereas 6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-methyl-3-pyridin-4-ylisoxazonolo[4,5-c]pyridin-4(5H)-one only antagonized responses of mGlu7/7 homodimers. Taken together with our electrophysiology observations, these results suggest that a receptor with pharmacology consistent with an mGlu7/8 heterodimer modulates the activity of SC-CA1 synapses. Building on this hypothesis, we identified two additional structurally related mGlu7 NAMs that also differ in their activity at mGlu7/8 heterodimers, in a manner consistent with their ability to inhibit synaptic transmission and plasticity at SC-CA1. Thus, we propose that mGlu7/8 heterodimers are a key molecular target for modulating the activity of hippocampal SC-CA1 synapses."

Assembled under tight regulation, βγ-CAT (a complex of non-lens βγ-crystallin and trefoil factor) is a pore-forming protein and trefoil factor complex identified in toad Bombina maxima. Here, we determined that this protein complex is a constitutive component in toad blood, that actively responds to the animal fasting. The protein complex was able to promote cellular albumin and albumin-bound fatty acid (FA) uptake in a variety of epithelial and endothelial cells, and the effects were attenuated by a macropinocytosis inhibitor. Endothelial cell-derived exosomes containing largely enriched albumin and FAs, called nutrisomes, were released in the presence of βγ-CAT. These specific nutrient vesicles were readily taken up by starved myoblast cells to support their survival. The results uncovered that pore-forming protein βγ-CAT is a fasting responsive element able to drive cell vesicular import and export of macromolecular nutrients."

https://openalex.org/W4294797980,"Cells adapt their metabolism to physiological stimuli, and metabolic heterogeneity exists between cell types, within tissues, and subcellular compartments. The liver plays an essential role in maintaining whole-body metabolic homeostasis and is structurally defined by metabolic zones. These zones are well-understood on the transcriptomic level, but have not been comprehensively characterized on the metabolomic level. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can be used to map hundreds of metabolites directly from a tissue section, offering an important advance to investigate metabolic heterogeneity in tissues compared to extraction-based metabolomics methods that analyze tissue metabolite profiles in bulk. We established a workflow for the preparation of tissue specimens for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI that can be implemented to achieve broad coverage of central carbon, nucleotide, and lipid metabolism pathways. Herein, we used this approach to visualize the effect of nutrient stress and excess on liver metabolism. Our data revealed a highly organized metabolic tissue compartmentalization in livers, which becomes disrupted under high fat diet. Fasting caused changes in the abundance of several metabolites, including increased levels of fatty acids and TCA intermediates while fatty livers had higher levels of purine and pentose phosphate-related metabolites, which generate reducing equivalents to counteract oxidative stress. This spatially conserved approach allowed the visualization of liver metabolic compartmentalization at 30 μm pixel resolution and can be applied more broadly to yield new insights into metabolic heterogeneity in vivo ."
https://openalex.org/W4294549679,"The heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) is a heme-sensing kinase that regulates mRNA translation in erythroid cells. In heme deficiency, HRI is activated to phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor 2α and halt production of globins, thus avoiding accumulation of heme-free globin chains. HRI is inhibited by heme via binding to one or two heme-binding domains within the HRI N-terminal and kinase domains. HRI has recently been found to inhibit fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production in adult erythroid cells. Depletion of HRI increases HbF production, presenting a therapeutically exploitable target for the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease or thalassemia, which benefit from elevated HbF levels. HRI is known to be an oligomeric enzyme that is activated through autophosphorylation, although the exact nature of the HRI oligomer, its relation to autophosphorylation, and its mode of heme regulation remain unclear. Here, we employ biochemical and biophysical studies to demonstrate that HRI forms a dimeric species that is not dependent on autophosphorylation, the C-terminal coiled-coil domain in HRI is essential for dimer formation, and dimer formation facilitates efficient autophosphorylation and activation of HRI. We also employ kinetic studies to demonstrate that the primary avenue by which heme inhibits HRI is through the heme-binding site within the kinase domain, and that this inhibition is relatively independent of binding of ATP and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α substrates. Together, these studies highlight the mode of heme inhibition and the importance of dimerization in human HRI heme-sensing activity."

Our high-resolution structure of Cy2 adopts a conformation that enables exploration of interactions with the extended thiazoline-containing cyclodehydration intermediate and the acceptor carrier protein (CP) to which it is tethered. We also report complementary electrostatic interfaces between Cy2 and its donor CP that mediate donor binding. Finally, we explored domain flexibility through normal mode analysis and identified small-molecule fragment-binding sites that may inform future antibiotic design targeting Cy function.

https://openalex.org/W4294668994,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and its receptors (IL-4R) promote the proliferation and polarization of macrophages. However, it is unknown if IL-4R also influences monocyte homeostasis and if steady state IL-4 levels are sufficient to affect monocytes. Employing full IL-4 receptor alpha knockout mice (IL-4Rα-/- ) and mice with a myeloid-specific deletion of IL-4Rα (IL-4Rαf/f LysMcre ), we show that IL-4 acts as a homeostatic factor regulating circulating monocyte numbers. In the absence of IL-4Rα, murine monocytes in blood were reduced by 50% without altering monocytopoiesis in the bone marrow. This reduction was accompanied by a decrease in monocyte-derived inflammatory cytokines in the plasma. RNA sequencing analysis and immunohistochemical staining of splenic monocytes revealed changes in mRNA and protein levels of anti-apoptotic factors including BIRC6 in IL-4Rα-/- knockout animals. Furthermore, assessment of monocyte lifespan in vivo measuring BrdU+ cells revealed that the lifespan of circulating monocytes was reduced by 55% in IL-4Rα-/- mice, whereas subcutaneously applied IL-4 prolonged it by 75%. Treatment of human monocytes with IL-4 reduced the amount of dying monocytes in vitro. Furthermore, IL-4 stimulation reduced the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the apoptosis pathway, including the phosphorylation of the NFκBp65 protein. In a cohort of human patients, serum IL-4 levels were significantly associated with monocyte counts. In a sterile peritonitis model, reduced monocyte counts resulted in an attenuated recruitment of monocytes upon inflammatory stimulation in IL-4Rαf/f LysMcre mice without changes in overall migratory function. Thus, we identified a homeostatic role of IL-4Rα in regulating the lifespan of monocytes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4294671711,"Despite the best treatment, approximately 10% of fractures still face undesirable repair and result in delayed unions or non-unions. Dynamic mechanical stimulation promotes bone formation, when applied at the correct time frame, with optimal loading magnitude, frequency, and repetition. Controlled mechanical loading significantly increases osteogenic cells during the matrix deposition phase of bone repair. In the bone defect, the blood vessel network guides the initial bone formation activities. A unique blood vessel subtype (Type H) exists in bone, which expresses high levels of CD31 and endomucin, and functions to couple angiogenesis and osteogenesis. However, how this form of controlled mechanical loading regulates the Type H vessels and promotes bone formation is still not clear. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) participates in the bone anabolic process and is a key regulator of the blood vessel. Its receptor, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1Pr1), is a mechanosensitive protein that regulates vascular integrity. Therefore, we hypothesis that controlled anabolic mechanical loading promotes bone repair by acting on Type H vessels. To study the effect of S1Pr1 on loading induced-bone repair, we utilized a stabilized tibial defect model, which allows for the application of anabolic mechanical loading. Mechanical loading upregulated S1Pr1 within the entire defect, with up to 80% expressed in blood vessels, as observed by deep tissue imaging. Additionally, S1Pr1 antagonism by W146 inhibited the anabolic effects of mechanical loading. We showed that mechanical loading or activating S1Pr1 could induce YAP nuclear translocation, a key regulator in the cell's mechanical response, in endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro. Inhibition of S1Pr1 in endothelial cells by siRNA reduced loading-induced YAP nuclear translocation and expressions of angiogenic genes. In vivo, YAP nuclear translocation in Type H vessels was up-regulated after mechanical loading but was inhibited by antagonizing S1Pr1. S1Pr1 agonist, FTY720, increased bone volume and Type H vessel volume, similar to that of mechanical stimulation. In conclusion, controlled anabolic mechanical loading enhanced bone formation mainly through Type H vessels in a S1Pr1-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W4294631248,"The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is a leading cause of meningoencephalitis in the immunocompromised. As current antifungal treatments are toxic to the host, costly, limited in their efficacy, and associated with drug resistance, there is an urgent need to identify vulnerabilities in fungal physiology to accelerate antifungal discovery efforts. Rational drug design was pioneered in de novo purine biosynthesis as the end products of the pathway, ATP and GTP, are essential for replication, transcription, and energy metabolism, and the same rationale applies when considering the pathway as an antifungal target. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of C. neoformans 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase/5'-inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC), a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the final two enzymatic steps in the formation of the first purine base inosine monophosphate. We demonstrate that mutants lacking the ATIC-encoding ADE16 gene are adenine and histidine auxotrophs that are unable to establish an infection in a murine model of virulence. In addition, our assays employing recombinantly expressed and purified C. neoformans ATIC enzyme revealed Km values for its substrates AICAR and 5-formyl-AICAR are 8-fold and 20-fold higher, respectively, than in the human ortholog. Subsequently, we performed crystallographic studies that enabled the determination of the first fungal ATIC protein structure, revealing a key serine-to-tyrosine substitution in the active site, which has the potential to assist the design of fungus-specific inhibitors. Overall, our results validate ATIC as a promising antifungal drug target."

We aim to explore the effects and mechanisms of wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) in the progression of DR. To establish DR in vitro and in vivo, human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell line ARPE-19 was treated with high-glucose (HG) and diabetic mice models were induced by streptozotocin (STZ), respectively. Different dose of recombinant WIF1 protein was used to treat DR. qRT-PCR and western blotting results demonstrated that WIF1 was downregulated, while VEGFA was upregulated in HG-induced ARPE-19 cells. WIF1 overexpression promoted cell migration. The ARPE-19 cells culture medium treated with WIF1 inhibited retinal endothelial cell tube formation and downregulated VEGFA expression. Moreover, WIF1 decreased the levels of ROS and MDA, while increasing the activity of SOD and GPX. WIF1 increased the ΔΨm in the mitochondria and downregulated the expression of mitochondrial autophagy-related proteins including Parkin, Pink1, LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, cleaved caspase 3, and cyt-c, which ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction. The in vivo studies further demonstrated the consistent effects of WIF1 in STZ-induced mice. Taken together, WIF1 ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction in DR by downregulating the AMPK/mTOR pathway."

The study was conducted on 15 residents (with less than two years post-graduation) and ran from November 2020 to March 2021. Faculty members played the role of simulated patients in 20 cases, and the residents conducted the medical interviews. In 10 of the 20 cases, a medical interview support application was used. After the interview, the residents were asked to list up to 10 differential diseases; the interview was considered appropriate if it included the disease portrayed by the simulated patient. Furthermore, the duration of the medical interview, the number of questions asked, and changes in stress parameters were evaluated. The use of a medical interview support application increased the percentage of appropriate medical interviews. Considering the frequency, the use of a medical interview support application increased the rate of appropriate medical interviews in the rare disease group, as well as the number of questions and duration of the interviews. No stress reduction was observed. The medical interview support application may be a useful tool in identifying appropriate differential diseases during medical interviews by residents."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is accompanied by meningeal injury. We hypothesized that the TBI-induced meningeal injury would damage lymphatic vessels and affect brain function. We observed altered gene expression in meningeal lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in a mouse model of TBI. Through flow cytometry–based cell sorting, meningeal LECs were obtained from a mouse model of controlled cortical impact 3 days after TBI. Microarray analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to determine mRNA and protein expression levels in meningeal LECs. The number of meningeal LECs was significantly lower in the injury group than in the sham group 3 days after TBI. Additionally, the mRNA expression of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (a specific marker of lymphatic vessels) in meningeal LECs was significantly lower in the injury group than in the sham group. The mRNA and protein expression of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 4 and neuropilin 2 (markers of lymphangiogenesis) in meningeal LECs was significantly higher in the injury group than in the sham group.

Methods Body weight and body mass index, resting blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin and lipids were assessed in 68 healthy untrained adults (26±6 years) who underwent three-months of exercise training targeted at improving cardiopulmonary fitness (endurance) and skeletal muscle function (resistance), separated by three-months washout. Results There were significant increases in weight and body mass index following resistance (+0.8 kg, P&lt;0.01; and +0.26 kg/m 2 , P&lt;0.01, respectively), but not endurance (+0.1 kg, P = 0.75; and +0.03 kg/m 2 , P = 0.70, respectively). Although no significant group changes resulted from training in other cardiovascular risk factors, the positive response rate for all variables ranged from 27–49% for resistance and 42–58% for endurance. Between 39–59% of individuals who did not respond to resistance nonetheless responded to endurance, and 28–54% who did not respond to endurance responded to resistance. Conclusion Whilst, on average, 12 weeks of resistance or endurance did not change most cardiovascular risk factors, many subjects showed robust positive responses. Exercise modality had an impact on the proportion of subjects who responded to training, and non-response to one mode of training did not imply non-response to the alternate mode. Although the effect of exercise on a single risk factor may be modest, the effect on overall cardiovascular risk profile can be dramatic. Study registration The study was registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, which was published prior to recruitment and randomization ( ACTRN12616001095459 )."

However, the mechanism behind that is not investigated.Ovalbumin (OVA)- sensitized BALB/c female mice were treated intranasally (IN) or intraperitoneally (IP) with abatacept 4 hrs before the OVA challenge. The effects of abatacept IN or IP on the lungs and blood levels of Tregs and Bregs and their production of immunosuppressive cytokines, were determined using FACS analysis and ELISA assay.Treating OVA- sensitized asthmatic mice model with abatacept, IN or IP, reduced lung inflammation. IN treatment with abatacept increased the frequency of IL-35 and IL-10 producing Bregs in the lung tissues to a higher level compared to IP treatment. Moreover, the frequency of lungs LAG3+ Tregs was significantly increased following treatment. This was also associated with a reduction in lung tissue and serum IL-17 levels of treated mice.These results suggest that abatacept by enhancing IL-35+IL-10+ Bregs and LAG3+ Tregs might reverse IL-17 induced lung inflammation during asthma."
https://openalex.org/W4294798047,"Introduction General practitioners (GP) increasingly face the challenge of meeting the complex care needs of multi-morbid patients. Previous studies show that GP practices would like support from other institutions in advising on social aspects of care for multi-morbid patients. Already existing counselling services, like community care points, are not sufficiently known by both GPs and patients. The aim of COMPASS II is to investigate the feasibility of cooperation between GP practices and community care points. Methods and analysis During the intervention, GPs send eligible multi-morbid patients with social care needs to a community care point. The community care points report the consultation results back to the GPs. In preparation for the intervention, in a moderated process, GP practices meet with the community care points to agree on information exchange. The primary outcome is the feasibility of the cooperation: Questionnaires will be sent to GPs, medical practice assistances and community care point personnel (focus: practicality, acceptability). Data will be collected on frequency and reasons for GP-initiated consultations at community care points (focus: demand). Qualitative interviews will be conducted with all participating groups (focus: acceptability, satisfaction). The secondary outcome is the assessment of changes in health-related quality of life, social support and satisfaction with care: participating patients complete a questionnaire before and three to six months after their counselling. The results of the study will be incorporated into a manual in which the experiences of the cooperation will be made available to other GP practices and community care points. Discussion In COMPASS II, GP practices establish cooperation with community care points. The latter are already existing institutions that provide independent and free advice on social matters. By using an existing institution, the established cooperation and experiences from the study can be used beyond the end of the study. Trial registration The trial is registered with DRKS-ID: DRKS00023798 , Coordination of Medical Professions Aiming at Sustainable Support II."

Identifying the factors that govern the spatial-temporal distribution and interaction of membrane proteins is critical for addressing key questions in cell biology. These include determining the structural underpinnings of intercellular engagement and the mechanisms of effector signaling upon receptor activation. Identifying the key structure-function relationships relies upon quantifying protein dynamics and association state (1Kellner R.R. Baier C.J. Willig K.I. Hell S.W. Barrantes F.J.

Biol. 2014; 20: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) are often employed to quantify and spatially map protein–protein interactions, clustering, self-association, and dynamics. One commonly used approach for characterizing self-association is homoFRET, which occurs due to energy transfer between identical fluorophores that can act as either donors or acceptors. In homoFRET, nonradiative energy transfer between identical fluorophores located within the requisite Förster distance results in depolarized emission upon excitation with linearly polarized light. As such, this method reports on interactions that occur over distances less than 10 nm and with transfer efficiencies dependent on the fluorophore, local structure, and extent of conformational flexibility (5Piston D.W.

The result of homoFRET imaging is a diffraction-limited pixel-wise anisotropy map that reports the spatial distribution of self-association. Although FRET-based approaches provide insights into the proximity of two interacting fluorophores, the diffraction limit classically limits the extent of spatial localization. Developments in super-resolution fluorescence microscopy or single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) are allowing researchers to resolve objects with a localization precision of 20 to 100 nm, often revealing subdiffraction limit structural features (11Hell S.W.

Bonifacino J.S. et al.Imaging intracellular fluorescent proteins at nanometer resolution.Science. 2006; 313: 1642-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (6554) Google Scholar). A key limitation for SMLM lies in determining whether the localized structures are in fact interacting or are simply clustered in a noninteracting fashion. This is further complicated by the very nature of the SMLM acquisition and image processing algorithms, which typically rely on stochastic excitation of, and emission from, individual fluorophores. This challenge prompted us to develop an integrated approach that would marry the high spatial resolution of SMLM with self-association data provided by homoFRET. Since homoFRET images are diffraction-limited, the pixel-wise r-values can only report on the average association state within the pixel, and not the true spatial distribution. In principle, correlating super-resolution and homoFRET images would provide new insights into the relationships between oligomeric state and spatial distribution (24Oreopoulos J. Gray-Owen S.D. Yip C.M. High density or urban sprawl: what works best in biology?.ACS Nano. 2017; 11: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Here we describe the methodology behind a correlative STORM/homoFRET technique (Figs. 1 and S1). When applied to membrane or membrane-associated proteins, this correlated approach can reveal their nanoscale distribution and oligomerization or self-association state. For the purposes of the present work, we focused on the prototype member of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family, which are cell surface glycoproteins involved in homophilic and heterophilic intercellular interactions involved in cellular growth, differentiation, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and infection (25Gray-Owen S.D. Blumberg R.S. CEACAM1: contact-dependent control of immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Despite CEACAMs’ importance in health and disease, the nature of CEACAM interactions and their mechanisms of signaling remain poorly understood. The full-length splice variant of CEACAM1 has an extracellular domain consisting of an amino-terminal IgV-like domain and three IgC2-like domains, with all these domains being heavily glycosylated (26Nagaishi T. Pao L. Lin S.H. Iijima H. Kaser A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 5749-5760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This protein is anchored into the membrane via a transmembrane sequence and a 76-amino acid cytoplasmic domain that contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, although some variants lack these sequences (25Gray-Owen S.D. Blumberg R.S. CEACAM1: contact-dependent control of immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). While it has been known that CEACAM1 can exist as a monomer, a dimer, or higher-order oligomer (Fig. 2) and that different oligomeric forms engage different downstream signaling cascades, how these complexes are distributed remains unknown (28Patel P.C. Lee H.S. Ming A.Y. Rath A. Deber C.M. Yip C.M. et al.Inside-out signaling promotes dynamic changes in the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) oligomeric state to control its cell adhesion properties.J.

Furthermore, the dynamics and interchange between these oligomeric states remain poorly characterized. These questions prompted us to develop a correlative STORM/homoFRET-based approach for characterizing the nanoscale distribution of CEACAM1-4L monomers and oligomers on the cell surface. In this study, homoFRET measurements were performed using YFP-labeled CEACAM1-4L, while STORM imaging was accomplished through a YFP-specific camelid single domain antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647). The human endocervically derived HeLa cells are one of the few epithelial cell lines that lacks endogenous CEACAMs, allowing ectopic expression of individual CEACAM1-4L family members to ascribe function. Past work has shown that ectopically expressed CEACAM1-4L (CEACAM1) can transition between the monomeric and cis-dimeric forms seen in cell lines that naturally express this protein (28Patel P.C. Lee H.S. Ming A.Y. Rath A. Deber C.M. Yip C.M. et al.Inside-out signaling promotes dynamic changes in the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) oligomeric state to control its cell adhesion properties.J.

Evidence for regulated dimerization of cell-cell adhesion molecule (C-CAM) in epithelial cells.Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, for these studies, we have used HeLa cells transiently transfected with a chimeric allele encoding CEACAM1 with a carboxyl terminus fused eYFP (CEACAM1-eYFP). To establish the range of values attainable, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)-based homoFRET measurements were determined using HeLa cells expressing soluble monomeric Venus (m-Venus) and the tandemly expressed dimeric Venus (td-Venus) (Fig. S4). Note that, due to the soluble nature of both m-Venus and td-Venus, we expected anisotropy values noticeably lower to what would be expected for a more restricted membrane-bound target. Before this and all subsequent experiments, the G-factor correction factor was measured to correct for potentially varying light sensitivities of the detectors that capture parallel and perpendicular polarizations. In addition, we have shown that the resulting pixel-wise anisotropy map is independent of the given intensity values and is, therefore, expressed as a ratio between the two captured emission channels (Fig. S5). Live-cell TIRF-homoFRET imaging of CEACAM1-eYFP in HeLa cells revealed the presence of both diffuse and irregularly bright regions. Counterintuitively, the low intensity/diffuse regions were comprised of predominantly dimeric or oligomeric CEACAM1 with anisotropy values ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, while the high intensity/clustered regions appeared more monomeric, with anisotropy values ranging from 0.3 to 0.45 (Fig. 3). Saturated pixels are not taken into consideration in the homoFRET calculation as the anisotropy calculation requires two intensity values from the collected images, while pixels with low gray-scale values (close to background levels) are removed using a threshold value kept constant for all analyzed cells (Fig. 3E). The presence of cell-to-cell variability suggests that the observed equilibrium is regulated by the cell, stages of the cell cycle, interactions with neighboring cells, and overall CEACAM1-specific biology (Fig. S2). In addition, we performed homoFRET experiments on a well-characterized CEACAM1 mutant known to be unable to form cis-dimers. These experiments revealed a dramatic shift to higher anisotropy values for this monomeric mutant (Fig. S6). We subsequently performed homoFRET experiments on a CEACAM1 mutant (R43S/Q44L) incapable of forming trans-homophilic interactions (28Patel P.C. Lee H.S. Ming A.Y. Rath A. Deber C.M. Yip C.M. et al.Inside-out signaling promotes dynamic changes in the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) oligomeric state to control its cell adhesion properties.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 29654-29669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this case, the histogram distribution is shifted toward lower pixel values, indicative of enrichment in cis-dimers and oligomers (Fig. S6). Although not the focus of this paper, these insights highlight the fact that most oligomeric CEACAM1 exists likely in the cis (nonmonomeric) conformation. Overall, these experiments highlight the utility of this approach for studying self-association states. There is clearly a nonuniform spatial distribution of anisotropies across the surface of each cell, with an unexpected inverse correlation between CEACAM1 density (reflected by eYFP intensity) and the proportion of CEACAM1 that is in an oligomeric state (reflected by lower anisotropy values). However, the diffraction-limited spatial resolution of homo-FRET prevents clear characterization of CEACAM1 organization within these regions. To overcome this limitation, we applied STORM imaging to the same samples that had been characterized by TIRF-homoFRET imaging. For STORM imaging, CEACAM1-eYFP is labeled with an AF647-labeled eYFP-specific camelid single domain antibody (Fig. 4) (32Platonova E. Winterflood C.M. Junemann A. Albrecht D. Faix J. Ewers H. Single-molecule microscopy of molecules tagged with GFP or RFP derivatives in mammalian cells using nanobody binders.Methods. 2015; 88: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Dempsey G.T.

Met. 2011; 8: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). A key challenge in the use of antibodies for STORM imaging lies in the size and flexibility of the antibodies themselves, which are typically ∼13 nm long; this can result in significant variability in the localization. To address this, we elected to use a nanobody comprised solely of the 12 to 15 kDa variable domain of a camelid antibody heavy chain. This nanobody is ∼1.5 to 2.5 nm in size and has been specifically engineered to bind to the β-barrel of GFP and its derivatives (including eYFP) with high specificity and affinity (34Wachter R.M. Elsliger M.A. Kallio K. Hanson G.T. Remington S.J. Structural basis of spectral shifts in the yellow-emission variants of green fluorescent protein.Struct. Folding Des. 1998; 6: 1267-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Moreover, nanobodies only bear 1 to 2 fluorophores, which both reduces the likelihood of overlocalizing the individual antibody (or nanobody) during STORM imaging and minimizes the generation of self-clustering artifacts. Overlapping point spread functions (PSFs) can lead to mislocalization and underestimation or overestimation of single emitters. This can lead to the artifactual creation of clusters or nanodomains, even in the case of a homogeneous distribution. As described by Sauer et al. (35Koley D. Bard A.J. Triton X-100 concentration effects on membrane permeability of a single HeLa (Koley and Bard 2010) cell by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 16783-16787Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), in order to minimize false multiple-fluorophore localizations, the lifetime of the off-state has to be significantly longer than that of the on-state. In this way, the distances between individual blinks are large enough to minimize PSF overlaps. Here, we aim to measure the average distances between individual PSFs for both the antibody and nanobody labeling strategies to confirm that we have achieved sufficient separation. We randomly selected 10 frames from the 1000 frames dataset acquired for a given cell and super-resolved the individual frames prior to conducting a nearest-neighbor analysis on the resulting coordinates (Fig. S8). To compare and contrast the antibody and nanobody labeling approaches, three replicate experiments were conducted to account for sample preparation variability. The average nearest neighbor distances for PSFs for each of the antibody (n = 4307 PSFs) and nanobody (n = 5231 PSFs) labeling strategies were 1725 nm (±19) and 2040 nm (±26), respectively (p < 0.005 using a two-sample t test). These results strongly indicate that both strategies generate raw datasets with comparable localization densities that should maximize the signal to noise ratio (and hence the localization precision), while minimizing instances of mislocalization and self-clustering artifacts. These results highlight the appropriateness of our labeling strategy for STORM imaging of protein nanoclusters. For STORM imaging, the CEACAM1-eYFP HeLa cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and then labeled with 1 nM of AF647-conjugated anti-YFP nanobody for 30 min (Fig. S7). Analysis of conventional wide-field fluorescence images (Fig. 4, B–D) revealed that the eYFP- and AF647-labeled regions were highly colocalized (Pearson coefficient = 0.861 ± 0.05 measured from six cells for each of three replicate experiments (Fig. S3). In addition, since the AF647-labeled nanobody is bound to an eYFP which itself is bound to a flexible linker attached to the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1, we characterized the small but non-negligible fluctuation of the fluorophore’s position over a 1 min acquisition period (Fig. S9). We found this fluctuation to be well below the localization precision of STORM imaging. These data suggest that this approach provides for highly specific high-affinity labeling and thus enables correlative STORM/homoFRET experiments. While homoFRET of CEACAM1-eYFP can be performed on live cells, staining with the anti-eYFP nanobody requires fixation and permeabilization of the cells. To assess how these steps may affect correlation of the anisotropy and STORM datasets, anisotropy measurements were performed after each fixation and permeabilization step (Fig. 5). While close inspection of the corresponding images indicates that the cluster distributions and morphologies remained largely unaffected by these steps (Fig. S10), permeabilization did produce an apparent shift toward lower anisotropies or oligomeric CEACAM1. The cumulative anisotropy plots revealed no significant shift in anisotropy upon fixation, whereas permeabilization caused a small shift to the right (Fig. 5, G and H). However, after detergent removal during nanobody labeling, the cumulative anisotropy curve appeared to revert to values comparable to those originally obtained in the fixed but nonpermeabilized samples. This suggests that detergent-induced distortion occurring during permeabilization may be transient in nature due to the low concentration of Triton X-100 used. This is consistent with prior work showing that only at concentrations above 0.20 mM does Triton X-100 exerts an irreversible effect on membrane permeability (35Koley D. Bard A.J. Triton X-100 concentration effects on membrane permeability of a single HeLa (Koley and Bard 2010) cell by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 16783-16787Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Overall, fixation, permeabilization, and labeling as performed in our experiments appear to minimally alter self-association states, clustering, and overall cell morphology (see Experimental procedures). Our diffraction-limited TIRF microscopy revealed that CEACAM1 is distributed either in a diffuse manner or as clusters exhibiting various sizes and shapes. To understand the nature of the CEACAM1 species within the clusters, Voronoi tessellation–based cluster analysis was performed on super-resolved CEACAM1 datasets using the SR-Tesseler package (Fig. 6). Voronoi tessellation subdivides a set of coordinates into polygonal regions by tracing the bisector to each of two nearest neighbors. For each coordinate, the mean distance to the adjacent nearest neighbors can be calculated, generating a mean distance distribution per cell or region of interest. Regions of interest can be thresholded out and clusters identified by setting the number of localizations and cluster area minima and maxima (Fig. S11). Remarkably, this clustering analysis revealed the presence of a consistent trimodal distribution of the mean distance histogram, suggestive of the presence of diffuse regions, microclusters, and nanoclusters (Fig. S12). Since the work is conducted in fixed cells, the apparent differences in nanoclustering frequency across analyzed cells likely reflects the short-lived nature of nanoclusters. However, we have captured live-cell confocal datasets that have clearly shown the persistence and presence of microclusters in both the basolateral and apical membrane of transiently transfected HeLa cells (Fig. S17). Here, microclusters and nanoclusters are defined as a function of cluster density that appears to correlate well with cluster area and diameter. Similar higher density regions have been reported for other membrane proteins and are thought to exist in order to restrict their activity to intercellular contact points or to co-localize with subcellular structures (36Gasparrini F.

While not core to this methods paper, Fig. S15 presents results highlighting a preferential enrichment in monomers within intercellular contact sites. Once the different cluster groups were identified, we measured area, density, circularity, and diameter for each of the nanocluster and microclustered regions from four cells. While circularities are similar (0.55–0.60), the average cluster diameter for microclusters and nanoclusters were 215 nm ± 27 and 49 nm ± 28, respectively (Fig. S18, B and C). Finally, nanoclusters appear almost 3 times denser than microclusters (Fig. S17D). These differences may reflect functional differences between the microclusters and nanoclusters and differences in their association to the lipid membrane and cytoskeletal components. After cluster analysis via Voronoi tessellation, the diffraction-limited homoFRET image was scaled up without interpolation to a 6502 × 6502 pixel 16 bit image and then overlaid on the corresponding STORM image. CEACAM1 clusters of different shapes, sizes, and density can be correlated to their respective per-pixel r values and, conversely, pixels with a given anisotropy can be assigned with a subdiffraction pixel nanodistribution (Fig. S13). While we cannot completely discount the possibility of processing artifacts in the registration of the super-resolution STORM with the homoFRET datasets, the fact that the individual point-spread functions do span several adjacent pixels suggests that this effect is li"

Among them, TWIK1-related alkalinization-activated K+ channel 1 (TALK1), TWIK1-related alkalinization-activated K+ channel 2 (TALK2), and TWIK1-related acid-sensitive K+ channel 2 (TASK2) form a subfamily of structurally related K2P channels stimulated by extracellular alkalosis. The human genes encoding these proteins are clustered at chromosomal region 6p21 and coexpressed in multiple tissues, including the pancreas. The question whether these channels form functional heteromers remained open. By analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data, we show that these channels are coexpressed in insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells. Using in situ proximity ligation assay and electrophysiology, we show that they form functional heterodimers both upon heterologous expression and under native conditions in human pancreatic β-cells. We demonstrate that heteromerization of TALK2 with TALK1 or with TASK2 endows TALK2 with sensitivity to extracellular alkalosis in the physiological range. We further show that the association of TASK2 with TALK1 and TALK2 increases their unitary conductance. These results provide a new example of heteromerization in the K2P channel family expanding the range of the potential physiological and pathophysiological roles of TALK1/TALK2/TASK2 channels, not only in insulin-secreting cells but also in the many other tissues in which they are coexpressed.

Signal. 2017; 10eaan2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The role of TALK1 in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is further supported by the fact that islet β-cells from TALK1 KO mice exhibit increased Vm depolarization, augmented Ca2+ influx, and elevated second phase GSIS (7Vierra N.C. Dadi P.K. Jeong I. Dickerson M. Powell D.R. Jacobson D.A. Type 2 diabetes-associated K+ channel TALK-1 modulates beta-cell electrical excitability, second-phase insulin secretion, and glucose homeostasis.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 3818-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In human, the TALK1 polymorphism rs1535500, which results in a gain of function (A277E), has been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (9Cho Y.S. Lee J.Y. Park K.S. Nho C.W.

Prevention and management of type 2 diabetes: potential role of genomics.Int. J. Appl. Basic Med. Res. 2014; 4: S1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, another gain-of-function mutation in TALK1 (L114P) was identified in a family with maturity-onset diabetes of the young. Both mutations resulted in reduced GSIS because of impaired intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (7Vierra N.C. Dadi P.K. Jeong I. Dickerson M. Powell D.R. Jacobson D.A.

Nakhe A.Y. et al.A KCNK16 mutation causing TALK-1 gain of function is associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young.JCI Insight. 2021; 6e138057Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the physiological function of TALK2, as this channel is absent in mice. A gain-of-function mutation in TALK2 (G88R) was described in a human patient with another mutation in a sodium channel gene (SCNA5) with a cardiac phenotype suggesting that TALK2 may act as a modifier of cardiac arrhythmia (12Friedrich C. Rinne S. Zumhagen S. Kiper A.K. Silbernagel N. Netter M.F. et al.Gain-of-function mutation in TASK-4 channels and severe cardiac conduction disorder.EMBO Mol. Med. 2014; 6: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast to TALK2, TASK2 channel has been implicated in several functions mostly in brain and kidneys. TASK2 is involved in central oxygen chemoreception (13Gestreau C. Heitzmann D. Thomas J. Dubreuil V. Bandulik S. Reichold M. et al.Task2 potassium channels set central respiratory CO2 and O2 sensitivity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A loss-of-function mutation (T180P) with dominant-negative (DN)effect on wildtype TASK2 has been reported with higher frequency among patients predisposed to Balkan endemic nephropathy, a chronic kidney disease (16Reed A.P. Bucci G. Abd-Wahab F. Tucker S.J.

Int. 2014; 2014920723Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization between pore-forming subunits occurs within the K2P channel family (see Ref. (18Khoubza L. Chatelain F.C. Feliciangeli S. Lesage F. Bichet D. Physiological roles of heteromerization: focus on the two-pore domain potassium channels.J. Physiol. 2021; 599: 1041-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) for recent review). Heterodimeric channels often exhibit unique electrophysiological and pharmacological properties compared with the corresponding homodimers. By mixing and matching subunits, heteromerization increases functional diversity and contributes to pharmacological heterogeneity in the K2P channel family. The first demonstration of heteromerization was between TASK1 and TASK3 (19Czirjak G. Enyedi P.

Although some of these intergroup heterodimers have been confirmed by independent studies, others remain unclear as they were not detected by other studies (18Khoubza L. Chatelain F.C.

The genes encoding TALK1 (KCNK16), TALK2 (KCNK17), and TASK2 (KCNK5) are located in the same chromosomal region (6p21), KCNK16 being separated from KCNK17 by less than 1 kb (4Girard C. Duprat F.

Commun. 2001; 282: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This genetic clustering suggests that their transcription may be coordinated (at least partially), and that these channel subunits may associate to form heterodimeric channels. TALK1 is expressed in pancreatic cells and gastric somatostatin cells (6Duprat F. Girard C. Jarretou G. Lazdunski M.

TALK1, TALK2, and TASK2 are all expressed in the pancreas. Unlike TALK1, TALK2 and TASK2 are expressed in other tissues. TALK2 is present in placenta, lung, liver, small intestine, heart, and aorta and, to a lesser extent in the brain (31Decher N. Maier M. Dittrich W. Gassenhuber J. Bruggemann A.

Here, we reexamine the coexpression of TALK1, TALK2, and TASK2 at the single-cell level and provide evidence of a physical and functional interaction between these subunits.

These results cannot be used for comparing their relative expression levels in the tissues in which they are expressed, as the experimental conditions (blots and probes for Northern blot analysis, and complementary DNA [cDNA] templates and number of cycles for PCR) were not the same. We reexamined the distribution of these channels by taking advantage of data collected using transcriptomics that allow such a comparison, in not only tissues but also in cells. We first analyzed the expression of TALK1, TALK2, and TASK2 in the EMBL expression atlas database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/). The analysis of an RNA-Seq dataset of 53 human tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project shows that TASK2 and TALK2 are present in most tissues, whereas TALK1 has a more restricted distribution in pancreas, stomach, testis, and thyroid gland (Fig. 1B). Some tissues preferentially express one channel, such as TALK2 in aorta and coronary artery or TASK2 in the liver, ovary, colon, and bladder. In the lung, TALK2 and TASK2 are expressed at the same level. Only the pancreas expresses significant levels of the three channels (Fig. 1B). Because tissues are composed of different cell types that have the potential to express these channels at different levels, we next analyzed their expression in the major cell types of the pancreas. Data were extracted from a previous RNA-Seq study that profiled human pancreatic cells using single-cell transcriptomics (37Segerstolpe A. Palasantza A. Eliasson P. Andersson E.M. Andreasson A.C. Sun X. et al.Single-cell transcriptome profiling of human pancreatic islets in health and type 2 diabetes.Cell Metab. 2016; 24: 593-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). We analyzed channel expression in endocrine (α, β, γ, δ, and ε) and exocrine (acinar and ductal) cells (Fig. 1C). All cell types express TALK1, TALK2, and TASK2. However, TASK2 was found to be less expressed, relative to TALK1 and TALK2 expression, than expected from the EMBL expression atlas database (Fig. 1B). This may be due to the expression of TASK2 in another pancreatic cell type or to interindividual variations between the samples analyzed in these two studies (variations related to age, gender, or ethnicity). Because RNA-Seq was performed at the single-cell level (37Segerstolpe A. Palasantza A. Eliasson P. Andersson E.M. Andreasson A.C. Sun X. et al.Single-cell transcriptome profiling of human pancreatic islets in health and type 2 diabetes.Cell Metab. 2016; 24: 593-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), we were then able to analyze channel expression in individual cells of a given cell type. Figure 1D shows the analysis carried out for insulin-secreting β-cells. TALK1 was detected in 80 of the 99 cells studied (Fig. 1D). TALK2 was detected in 48 cells and TASK2 in 16 cells. Interestingly, both TALK1 and TALK2 were detected in 40 cells and TALK1 and TASK2 in three cells. TALK1, TALK2, and TASK2 were codetected in one cell of 99 analyzed. Taken together, these results show that TALK1, TALK2, and TASK2 have overlapping tissue distribution, and that they can be coexpressed at the cell level in the pancreatic β-cells. This suggested, by inference with what we have previously shown for the TREK and THIK subfamilies, that TALK1, TALK2, and TASK2 could associate to form heterodimers. A physical interaction between TALK1, TALK2, and TASK2 was first tested using in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) in cultured mammalian cells (Fig. 2A). This technique uses primary antibodies that bind to tags present on channel subunits. Primary antibodies are labeled with secondary antibodies containing cDNA strands. When antibodies are in close proximity (30–40 nm apart), the two strands hybridize, enabling subsequent DNA amplification by PCR. This amplification product is detected as a red fluorescent signal. Each pair of primary antibodies was tested for specificity (Fig. 2B). TALK1-FLAG subunit, cloned into the pIRES-enhanced GFP (EGFP) vector for green fluorescence coexpression, was expressed with TALK1-hemagglutinin (HA) or TALK1-V5 for positive controls (formation of homodimers). The percentage of positive cells was calculated by determining the ratio of cells with a positive signal (red) among the hundreds of transfected cells (green), from three to seven independent experiments (Fig. 2C). Most cells showed a positive PLA signal when the TALK1 homodimer is formed, that is between TALK1-FLAG and TALK1-HA (88%). Similar values were obtained when TALK1-FLAG was expressed with TALK2-HA (83%) or TASK2-V5 (75%), whereas only 3, 7, and 8% of positive cells were obtained with THIK1-HA, TASK1-V5, and TWIK2-V5, respectively (Fig. 2C). A slot blot was performed on cell lysates under the same conditions as in the PLA experiments. Some differences in the expression level of the different K2P subunits are observed (Fig. 2D) but with no correlation with the results obtained in PLA. For example, TALK1-HA is less expressed than TALK2-HA and THIK1-HA, but the PLA signal is significantly higher with TALK1 and TALK2 than with THIK1 (Fig. 2D). These results show that TALK1 can form heterodimers with TALK2 and TASK2 but not with THIK1, a member of another K2P channel subfamily. To confirm the interaction between TALK1, TALK2, and TASK2, we used a functional method based on channel poisoning with a nonfunctional subunit in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 3A). The same DN strategy was used to demonstrate heteromerization in TREK and THIK K2P channel subfamilies (20Blin S. Ben Soussia I. Kim E.J. Brau F. Kang D. Lesage F. et al.Mixing and matching TREK/TRAAK subunits generate heterodimeric K2P channels with unique properties.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 4200-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Blin S. Chatelain F.C. Feliciangeli S. Kang D. Lesage F. Bichet D.

Chem. 2014; 289: 28202-28212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In TALK1, we replaced the glycine residue at position 110 with a glutamate residue (G110E). This mutation in the pore domain of the channel leads to a loss of function. As expected, TALK1-G110E produced no measurable current (0.4 μA ± 0.1 versus 2.2 μA ± 0.3 for TALK1, at +60 mV, n = 9). To test its effect on TALK1, TALK1-G110E and TALK1 circular RNAs (cRNAs) were injected in equal amount. Representative current traces (Fig. 3C) and normalized mean current amplitudes (Fig. 3B) show that TALK1 is largely inhibited by TALK1-G110E (0.4 μA ± 0.1, n = 14) confirming the DN action of TALK1-G110E, renamed TALK1DN. We next coexpressed TALK1DN with other K2P subunits. In oocytes, expression of TALK2, TASK2, and THIK1 produced currents as expected (Fig. 3C). At +60 mV, the mean current amplitudes were 3.6 μA ± 0.7 (n = 12), 3.6 μA ± 1.7 (n = 16), and 4.6 μA ± 1.6 (n = 17), respectively. Coexpression of TALK1DN with TALK2 and TASK2 caused a dramatic decrease in current amplitude (Fig. 3C). The decrease reached 95% for TALK2 and 70% for TASK2, values that are comparable to the effect on TALK1 (60%). The decreases in TALK2 and TASK2 currents are consistent with the 75% decrease expected for a 1:1 ratio between DN and functional subunits (Fig. 3A). The smaller effect of TALK1DN on TALK1 (60%) is likely because of the fact that the baseline current of TALK1 is lower than that of TASK2 or TALK2 (∼1 μA for TALK1 versus ∼4 μA for TALK2 and TASK2) and that the current decrease cannot occur above endogenous oocyte current levels (∼100–300 nA). The inhibition of THIK1 by TALK1DN is much more limited (15%), suggesting a competitive effect on protein expression rather than heteromerization (Fig. 3, B and C). To ensure that the DN inhibition was by assembly and not due by a decrease in protein synthesis, the expression levels of the channels were determined by slot blot using the tags present on the different subunits (Fig. 3B). Thus, we found no major difference in channel or tubulin expression in the presence of TALK1DN under the different conditions. Taken together, the results of this electrophysiological approach confirm the formation of heteromers between TALK1 and TALK2 or TASK2. We then asked whether heteromerization between TALK1 and TALK2 or TASK2 produces heteromeric channels with distinct properties. An important characteristic of these channels is their sensibility to the extracellular pH. They are stimulated by alkalinization in the range of pH 7.5 to 10 (4Girard C. Duprat F. Terrenoire C.

However, the impact of PRR inhibition on liver inflammation and fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains unclear. Herein, C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal chow diet or fast food diet (FFD) for 24 weeks. Lentivirus-mediated PRR short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or handle region peptide (HRP), a PRR blocker, was administered for PRR inhibition. Mouse primary hepatocytes were cultured with palmitic acid, prorenin, siRNA-targeted PRR, and HRP. In FFD-fed mice, PRR inhibition via lentivirus-mediated PRR knockdown or HRP significantly attenuated liver steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Mechanistically, PRR knockdown or HRP decreased hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) abundance and upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα). HRP treatment also decreased hepatic PRR expression. In addition, intrahepatic oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammatory cell recruitment were ameliorated by PRR knockdown or HRP treatment, along with suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. PRR inhibition downregulated the hepatic expression of profibrotic factors, as well as TGF-β1/SMAD3 pathway. In primary mouse hepatocytes, PRR knockdown with siRNA or HRP downregulated cellular ACC and increased PPARα expression. In conclusion, our findings revealed that PRR inhibition attenuated hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with NASH. Accordingly, targeting PRR signaling may serve as a potential treatment for NASH."

https://openalex.org/W4294712110,"Antipsychotic agents are clinically utilized to treat schizophrenia and other mental disorders. These drugs induce neurological and metabolic side effects, but their influence on blood vessels remains largely unknown. Here, we show that haloperidol, one of the most frequently prescribed antipsychotic agents, induces vascular defects in bone marrow. Acute haloperidol treatment results in vascular dilation that is specific to hematopoietic organs. This vessel dilation is associated with disruption of hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), both of which are reversible after haloperidol withdrawal. Mechanistically, haloperidol treatment blocked the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) from HSPCs. Genetic blockade of VEGF-A secretion from hematopoietic cells or inhibition of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells result in similar vessel dilation in bone marrow during regeneration after irradiation and transplantation. Conversely, VEGF-A gain of function rescues the bone marrow vascular defects induced by haloperidol treatment and irradiation. Our work reveals an unknown effect of antipsychotic agents on the vasculature and hematopoiesis with potential implications for drug application in clinic."
https://openalex.org/W4294795797,"Purpose Advanced age-related macular degeneration (AAMD) risk is associated with rare complement Factor I (FI) genetic variants associated with low FI protein levels (termed ‘Type 1’), but it is unclear how variant prevalences differ between AMD patients from different ethnicities. Methods Collective prevalence of Type 1 CFI rare variant genotypes were examined in four European AAMD datasets. Collective minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were sourced from the natural history study SCOPE, the UK Biobank, the International AMD Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC), and the Finnish Biobank Cooperative (FINBB), and compared to paired control MAFs or background population prevalence rates from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Due to a lack of available genetic data in non-European AAMD, power calculations were undertaken to estimate the AAMD population sizes required to identify statistically significant association between Type 1 CFI rare variants and disease risk in different ethnicities, using gnomAD populations as controls. Results Type 1 CFI rare variants were enriched in all European AAMD cohorts, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging between 3.1 and 7.8, and a greater enrichment was observed in dry AMD from FINBB (OR 8.9, 95% CI 1.49–53.31). The lack of available non-European AAMD datasets prevented us exploring this relationship more globally, however a statistical association may be detectable by future sequencing studies that sample approximately 2,000 AAMD individuals from Ashkenazi Jewish and Latino/Admixed American ethnicities. Conclusions The relationship between Type 1 CFI rare variants increasing odds of AAMD are well established in Europeans, however the lack of broader genetic data in AAMD has adverse implications for clinical development and future commercialisation strategies of targeted FI therapies in AAMD. These findings emphasise the importance of generating more diverse genetic data in AAMD to improve equity of access to new treatments and address the bias in health care."
https://openalex.org/W4294797284,"The fork cell and von Economo neuron, which are found in the insular cortex and/or the anterior cingulate cortex, are defined by their unique morphologies. Their shapes are not pyramidal; the fork cell has two primary apical dendrites and the von Economo neurons are spindle-shaped (bipolar). Presence of such neurons are reported only in the higher animals, especially in human and great ape, indicating that they are specific for most evolved species. Although it is likely that these neurons are involved in higher brain function, lack of results with experimental animals makes further investigation difficult. We here ask whether equivalent neurons exist in the mouse insular cortex. In human, Fezf2 has been reported to be highly expressed in these morphologically distinctive neurons and thus, we examined the detailed morphology of Fezf2-positive neurons in the mouse brain. Although von Economo-like neurons were not identified, Fezf2-positive fork cell-like neurons with two characteristic apical dendrites, were discovered. Examination with electron microscope indicated that these neurons did not embrace capillaries, rather they held another cell. We here term such neurons as holding neurons. We further observed several molecules, including neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) that are known to be localized in the fork cells and/or von Economo cells in human, were localized in the mouse insular cortex. Based on these observations, it is likely that an equivalent of the fork cell is present in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W4294798002,"Non-essential toxic heavy metal like cadmium (Cd 2+ ) interferes with the plant growth and development in many ways. Cd 2+ travels via plant transportation system, specifically through xylem and may integrate into the food chain causing unfavorable condition in human health. Therefore, strategies to develop Cd 2+ tolerance and less accumulation in the plant system require urgent attention. Peroxidase gene family is known for metal ions transportation including Cd 2+ and thus plays an important role in ion homeostasis. Previously, we have reported the presence of a Cd 2+ dependent functional peroxiredoxin from Pennisetum glaucum (PgGPx). The present study elucidates the role of this PgGPx against Cd 2+ stress in rice. The transcript levels of PgGPx were found to be highly upregulated in response to exogenous Cd 2+ . Moreover, recombinant PgGPx protein showed significant glutathione S-transferase activity in vitro . Ectopically expressed PgGPx in transgenic rice plants showed tolerance towards Cd 2+ stress as demonstrated by several physiological indices including shoot and root length, biomass, chlorophyll, and hydrogen peroxide content. Moreover, these transgenic plants also showed enhanced capability to cope up with oxidative stress by enhancing the activity of different antioxidant enzymes including Superoxide dismutase, Catalase, Ascorbate peroxidase, Glutathione peroxidase, Glutathione reductase) in response to Cd 2+ . Hence, maintenance of cellular ion homeostasis and modulation of reactive oxygen species-scavenging pathway are found to be improved by overexpression of PgGPx under Cd 2+ stress. These results will pave the way to develop strategies for engineering Cd 2+ stress tolerance in economically important crop plants."
https://openalex.org/W4294843576,"Age-related changes in brain structure include atrophy of the brain parenchyma and white matter changes of presumed vascular origin. Enlargement of the ventricles may occur due to atrophy or impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation. The co-occurrence of these changes in neurodegenerative diseases and in aging brains often requires investigators to take both into account when studying the brain, however, automated segmentation of enlarged ventricles and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) can be a challenging task. Here, we present a hybrid multi-atlas segmentation and convolutional autoencoder approach for joint ventricle parcellation and WMH segmentation from magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Our fully automated approach uses a convolutional autoencoder to generate a standardized image of grey matter, white matter, CSF, and WMHs, which, in conjunction with labels generated by a multi-atlas segmentation approach, is then fed into a convolutional neural network to parcellate the ventricular system. Hence, our approach does not depend on manually delineated training data for new data sets. The segmentation pipeline was validated on both healthy elderly subjects and subjects with normal pressure hydrocephalus using ground truth manual labels and compared with state-of-the-art segmentation methods. We then applied the method to a cohort of 2401 elderly brains to investigate associations of ventricle volume and WMH load with various demographics and clinical biomarkers, using a multiple regression model. Our results indicate that the ventricle volume and WMH load are both highly variable in a cohort of elderly subjects and there is an independent association between the two, which highlights the importance of taking both the possibility of enlarged ventricles and WMHs into account when studying the aging brain."
https://openalex.org/W4294843853,"Retention of logging residue as dead wood could be a method to simultaneously increase biodiversity and predation rates of pest insects, in managed forests. Managed forests are generally low in diversity, and dead wood has been demonstrated to increase species diversity. Moreover, managed forests are predicted to suffer from higher frequency of insect outbreaks in the future, particularly in the northern hemisphere. In this study, we explore the effect of dead wood removal and addition in managed pine forest stands in Sweden on arthropod diversity and abundance and predation rates. We performed a controlled field experiment, focusing on logging residue type of dead wood. We used pitfall traps and sticky traps to measure arthropod diversity and abundance and plasticine larvae to assess predation rates. We specifically targeted generalist arthropods (i.e. non-wood living species), and predation rate on tree-dwelling larvae (corresponding to defoliating outbreak pests). We found no effect of dead wood addition on arthropod abundance or diversity, neither did we find an effect on predation rate. Despite the lack of effects in our study, we argue that dead wood can be an important component for both biodiversity of generalist arthropod and for pest control, but the effect may depend on both the specific arthropod group targeted and the specific life stage of the pest insect as well as on inherent components of the dead wood, such as age."
https://openalex.org/W4294549671,"Many eukaryotic protein kinases are activated by the intramolecular autophosphorylation of activation loop residues. Smk1 is a meiosis-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in yeast that autophosphorylates its activation loop tyrosine and thereby upregulates catalytic output. This reaction is controlled by an inhibitor, Isc10, that binds the MAPK during meiosis I and an activator, Ssp2, that binds Smk1/Isc10 during meiosis II. Upon completion of the meiotic divisions, Isc10 is degraded, and Smk1 undergoes autophosphorylation to generate the high activity form of the MAPK that controls spore formation. How Isc10 inhibits Smk1 is not clear. Here, we use a bacterial coexpression/reconstitution system to define a domain in the carboxy-terminal half of Isc10 that specifically inhibits Smk1 autophosphorylation. Nevertheless, Smk1 bound by this domain is able to phosphorylate other substrates, and it phosphorylates the amino-terminal half of Isc10 on serine 97. In turn, the phosphorylated motif in Isc10 inhibits the Smk1 active site. These data show that Isc10 inhibits autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of substrates by separate mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate Isc10 can inhibit the autophosphorylation of the mammalian intestinal cell kinase ICK1 (also known as CILK1), suggesting a conserved mechanism of action. These findings define a novel class of developmentally regulated molecules that prevent the self-activation of MAPKs and MAPK-like enzymes.

These findings define a novel class of developmentally regulated molecules that prevent the self-activation of MAPKs and MAPK-like enzymes. Autophosphorylation of the activation loop is a common mechanism that upregulates eukaryotic protein kinases (1Beenstock J. Mooshayef N. Engelberg D. How do protein kinases take a selfie (autophosphorylate)?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 938-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In some cases, activation loops are phosphorylated by upstream kinases, while in other cases, they are autophosphorylated. This latter mechanism of kinase activation is widespread, influencing the activity of at least a third of the human kinome. Activation loop autophosphorylation plays an especially prominent role in regulating CMGC group kinases (cyclin dependent kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, glycogen synthase kinases, and CDK-like kinases). In most cases, these reactions occur by an intramolecular (in-cis) mechanism. Although mature CMGC group kinases typically phosphorylate downstream substrates on serine/threonine (S/T) residues, the most commonly autophosphorylated activation loop residue is tyrosine (Y). It has been proposed that these reactions involve a transitional “Prone-to-Autophosphorylate” (PA) conformation (1Beenstock J. Mooshayef N. Engelberg D. How do protein kinases take a selfie (autophosphorylate)?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 938-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In several cases, autophosphorylation of activation loop Y-residues has been shown to take place cotranslationally or shortly after translation has taken place when the kinase is associated with the Hsp90/Cdc37 chaperone complex (2Han J.

More recently, it has been shown that activation loop autophosphorylation of CMGC kinases requires hydroxylation of a proline located in the CMGC/MAPK-insert, a distinct segment located in the C-lobe of most CMGC kinases (6Lee S.B. Ko A. Oh Y.T. Shi P. D'Angelo F. Frangaj B. et al.Proline hydroxylation primes protein kinases for autophosphorylation and activation.Mol. Cell. 2020; 79: 376-389.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that mutations that weaken the catalytic spine of the Erk2 MAPK can increase the cis-autophosphorylation of its activation loop Y (7Emrick M.A. Hoofnagle A.N. Miller A.S.

Taken together, these findings suggest that the cis-autophosphorylation of activation loop Y-residues is an evolutionarily ancient reaction that is repressed in some CMGC kinases yet not in others and that this mechanism enhances the regulatory repertoire of this critical group of signaling enzymes. The sporulation-specific MAPK, Smk1, is a meiosis-specific kinase in yeast that autophosphorylates its activation loop tyrosine (Y209) upon completion of the meiotic divisions (9Whinston E. Omerza G.

Cell Biol. 2013; 33: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). During MII, the monophosphorylated I complexes are bound by the activator, Ssp2, to form “poised” (P) complexes. As cells complete MII, the APC/CAma1 is activated. This leads to the ubiquitylation and degradation of the Isc10 protein, releasing “active” (A) complexes (Smk1/Ssp2) that undergo autophosphorylation. The doubly phosphorylated Smk1 bound to Ssp2 then triggers key steps in spore morphogenesis. The “inhibited/poised/active (IPA)” model for Smk1 activation thereby provides an explanation for how key steps in spore differentiation take place only after MII has been completed (16Rimal A. Kamdar Z.P. Tio C.W. Winter E. Isc10, a meiosis-specific MAPK binding protein links the APC/C to Smk1 activation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 40 (e00097–20)PubMed Google Scholar). This study was designed to investigate how Isc10 inhibits Smk1. We used a heterologous bacterial expression system, in vitro biochemical reactions, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoing meiotic development to show that Isc10 inhibits Smk1 through two mechanisms. First, a C-terminal segment in Isc10 specifically inhibits autophosphorylation of Smk1’s activation loop on Y209. This segment is referred to as the Y Autophosphorylation Inhibitor motif, or YAI hereafter. Although the YAI reduces the catalytic activity of Smk1 by preventing activation loop autophosphorylation, Smk1 that has not undergone autophosphorylation has a modest level of catalytic activity and Smk1 bound to the YAI can phosphorylate substrates. We find that Smk1 bound to Isc10 and Ssp2 phosphorylates the Isc10 protein on serine 97. The phosphorylated S97 motif in turn prevents Smk1 from phosphorylating Isc10 on other residues. We also find that an Smk1-Y209F mutant is not inhibited by the pS97 motif, suggesting that the Y209 hydroxyl plays an essential role in pS97-mediated inhibition. These findings suggest that once Smk1 undergoes autophosphorylation, it can no longer be inhibited by Isc10, implying a switch-like role for Isc10 in triggering activation of the MAPK. Our findings indicate that this switch operates during yeast meiotic development since expression of the YAI during meiosis in yeast downregulates Smk1 autophosphorylation. Interestingly, we find that Isc10 also inhibits the autophosphorylation of the activation loop Y of the mammalian intestinal cell kinase (ICK1). Smk1 autophosphorylation can be studied using a heterologous bacterial system in which Smk1, Ssp2, and Cak1 are coexpressed in various combinations (14Tio C.W. Omerza G. Phillips T. Lou H.J. Turk B.E. Winter E. Ssp2 binding activates the Smk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase.Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 37 (e00607–16)Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this system, Ssp2 is required for Smk1 catalytic activity and autophosphorylation of Smk1’s activation loop tyrosine (Y209). We showed that the kinase-activating domain (KAD) of Ssp2 is contained in the C-terminal half (residues 137–371) of Ssp2. In the experiments described here, we used Ssp2137-371 fused to glutathione-S-transferase (Ssp2KAD-GST). Cak1, which phosphorylates Smk1’s activation loop threonine (T207), modestly increases the Ssp2-dependent autophosphorylation of Smk1 on Y209. The expression of Isc10 eliminates almost all Y209 autophosphorylation in the presence or absence of Cak1 (16Rimal A. Kamdar Z.P. Tio C.W. Winter E. Isc10, a meiosis-specific MAPK binding protein links the APC/C to Smk1 activation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 40 (e00097–20)PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of Y209p autophosphorylation by Isc10 can be observed in Fig. 1A (compare the first two lanes in the top image). These findings reflect the roles of Ssp2, Cak1, and Isc10 in controlling the activation of Smk1 in meiotic yeast cells (16Rimal A. Kamdar Z.P. Tio C.W. Winter E. Isc10, a meiosis-specific MAPK binding protein links the APC/C to Smk1 activation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 40 (e00097–20)PubMed Google Scholar). To define the region of Isc10 that inhibits Smk1 autophosphorylation, we assayed deletions in the MBP-Isc10 construct. Removal of residues 1 to 110 from the N terminus of Isc10 (Isc10111-267) had little effect on Isc10’s ability to inhibit Smk1 autophosphorylation (Fig. 1A, N-end deletions). Removal of an additional 35 residues (Isc10146-267) reduced the ability of Isc10 to inhibit Smk1 autophosphorylation (pY209 becomes detectable). Deletion of 21 residues from the C terminus of Isc10 (Isc101-246) did not affect Isc10’s ability to inhibit Smk1 autophosphorylation, while deletion of an additional 44 residues (Isc101-203) reduced Isc10’s inhibitory activity (Fig. 1A, C-end deletions). These data show that the Y209 Autophosphorylation Inhibitory (YAI) segment resides between amino acids 110 and 246 of Isc10. Notably, this segment of Isc10 contains a region with a relatively high degree of evolutionary conservation across the Saccharomycetes family while the rest of Isc10 is poorly conserved (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the AlphaFold program predicts that the conserved region of Isc10 contains a high confidence secondary structure while it does not predict significant secondary structural features in the rest of the protein (22Varadi M. Anyango S. Deshpande M. Nair S. Natassia C. Yordanova G. et al.AlphaFold protein structure database: Massively expanding the structural coverage of protein-sequence space with high-accuracy models.Nucleic Acids Res. 2022; 50: D439-D444Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 23Jumper J. Evans R. Pritzel A. Green T. Figurnov M. Ronneberger O. et al.Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.Nature. 2021; 596: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (4111) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The major secondary structural features within this segment are four predicted α-helices (labeled pαhs 1–4 in Fig. 1C). While pαh’s 1 to 3 are highly conserved across Saccharomycetes species, pαh4 is not as conserved. We wondered whether pαh4 is important for YAI activity only in the full-length Isc10 protein but not in an Isc10 protein lacking the nonconserved amino-terminal segment. To test this, we generated a deleted Isc10 protein lacking both pαh4 and the first 110 nonconserved residues. This segment of Isc10 (Isc10111-203) was almost as effective as the full-length Isc10 protein in inhibiting the autophosphorylation of Smk1 on Y209 (Fig. 1A, right, N-end + C-end deletants). Moreover, further deletion of residues 111 to 145 to generate a fragment of Isc10 that contains only pαh’s 1 to 3 (Isc10146-203) retained partial YAI activity. pαh4’s importance for YAI activity when the first 110 residues of Isc10 are present but not when they are absent might suggest that this segment of Isc10 can modify the activity of the YAI through pαh4. Irrespective, these findings show that pαh’s 1 to 3 in the Isc10146-203 are sufficient for core YAI functionality. To assay the collection of MBP-Isc10 truncated mutants for binding to Ssp2 and Smk1, we purified the MBP-Isc10 proteins using amylose beads. Smk1 and Ssp2 that copurified with MBP-Isc10 in these samples were measured by immunoblotting (bound samples in Fig. 1A). All Isc10 fragments that inhibited Smk1 autophosphorylation formed complexes with Smk1 and Ssp2 that were stable to purification. However, some of the Isc10 mutants that did not fully inhibit Smk1 autophosphorylation also formed complexes with Smk1/Ssp2. Specifically, while the N-terminal truncated Isc10181-267 protein did not prevent autophosphorylation, it still formed complexes with Smk1/Ssp2. This suggests that while the most N-terminal helix predicted by AlphaFold (pαh1 [residues 155–168]) is required to inhibit Smk1 autophosphorylation, it is not essential for binding to Smk1/Ssp2 since pαh1 is not present in the binding competent but functionally defective deletant. Similarly, while Isc10’s inhibitory activity was significantly reduced when 64 amino acids were removed from the C terminus (the Isc101-203 protein in Fig. 1A), this mutant and even a mutant lacking 97 C-terminal residues (Isc101-170) still bound Smk1/Ssp2. These findings suggest that pαhs 2, 3, and 4, are not required for Isc10 to bind Smk1/Ssp2 since they are not present in the binding competent but functionally defective Isc101-170 protein. Indeed, binding was not eliminated from the C-terminally deleted proteins until an additional 30 residues, which contains the entirety of pαh1, were deleted from the Isc101-170 protein (generating Isc101-140). Collectively, these findings suggest that Isc10 binds Smk1/Ssp2 through two separate binding domains (BDs 1 and 2 as shown in the bottom of Fig. 1B) and that both BDs are required to inhibit Smk1 autophosphorylation. The data indicate that BD1 is within pαh1 and that BD2 is within the pαh2/3/4 segment (Fig. 1, B and C). Because pαh4 is not required for YAI functionality, we speculate that BD2 is within pαh2/3. To determine whether BD1 and BD2 can individually bind Smk1 and Ssp2, MBP fused to Isc10 residues 1 to 170 that contains BD1 or to Isc10 residues 181 to 267 that contains BD2, were produced in bacteria that coexpressed Smk1 or Ssp2. The MBP-Isc10 deletants were purified from bacterial extracts, and the presence of Smk1 or Ssp2 were tested (Fig. 1D). These assays show that BD1 and BD2 can each form complexes with Smk1 or Ssp2 in the absence of the other protein. Whether these interactions reflect mutually exclusive (potentially competitive) or simultaneous interactions in the poised Isc10/Smk1/Ssp2 complex remain to be determined. We next deleted the first 110 codons from the ISC10 gene in yeast. Smk1 autophosphorylation was decreased by more than 80% in post-meiotic isc10-Δ110 cells compared to wild-type (WT) cells (Fig.2A). These results indicate that the YAI is sufficient to inhibit Smk1 autophosphorylation not only in the reconstituted bacterial system but also in yeast cells that are undergoing meiotic development. In addition, these results show that YAI activity in the isc10-Δ110 mutant is persistent, even past meiosis II when full-length Isc10 is degraded in WT cells (16Rimal A. Kamdar Z.P. Tio C.W. Winter E. Isc10, a meiosis-specific MAPK binding protein links the APC/C to Smk1 activation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 40 (e00097–20)PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the persistent inhibition of Smk1 autophosphorylation, the isc10-Δ110 mutant formed 50% fewer spores than an ISC10 control strain when two copies of an epitope-tagged form of SMK1 (SMK1-HH) were present and 80% fewer spores when one copy of SMK1-HH was present (Fig. 2B). These findings genetically connect the meiotic function of isc10-Δ110 to SMK1. The APC/CAma1 E3 ubiquitin ligase targets full-length Isc10 for destruction as cells exit MII. One explanation for the persistent YAI activity in the isc10-Δ110 strain is that the 1 to 110 interval of Isc10 is required for its regulated degradation. To address this possibility, the WT and Δ110 forms of Isc10 were compared at different times during meiotic development (Fig. 2, C and D). Both the full-length and deleted forms of Isc10 start to accumulate at 5 h postinduction, when cells are entering MI. As previously reported, the level of full-length Isc10 declines starting around 8 h postinduction, as cells are completing MII, and is undetectable at 24 h. In contrast, the Isc10-Δ110 protein persists after MII has been completed, and it accumulates to higher levels. It has previously been reported that the levels of full-length Isc10 are similarly increased in postmeiotic cells lacking AMA1 or the core APC/C subunit gene, SWM1 (16Rimal A. Kamdar Z.P. Tio C.W. Winter E. Isc10, a meiosis-specific MAPK binding protein links the APC/C to Smk1 activation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 40 (e00097–20)PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the amino-terminal half of Isc10 is required for the APC/CAma1-dependent destruction of Isc10 as cells complete MII. We next examined the effect of full-length Isc10 on Smk1 catalytic output in the bacterial system using phosphospecific antibodies. These experiments revealed that full-length Isc10 prevents Smk1 from phosphorylating numerous proteins on Y and T residues (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3A). There is an exception however—a protein that comigrates with MBP-Isc10 (indicated by the arrow) that is immunoreactive with the pT antibody. We also analyzed these samples by tandem mass spectrometry (MS). Full-length Isc10 decreased the phosphorylation of bacterial proteins by 75%. Isc10 was phosphorylated by Smk1 on numerous S and T residues with S97 being the major site of phosphorylation (Fig. 3B and Supporting Fig. S1). These results show that although Isc10 prevents Smk1/Ssp2 from phosphorylating bacterial proteins, it does not prevent Smk1/Ssp2 from phosphorylating itself. The mAb used in these experiments binds pT residues with high affinity, but it has also been reported to bind pS residues in some peptides with low affinity. Whether the immunoreactivity of Isc10 shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3A is a consequence of T residues throughout the protein that the MS/MS analysis indicates are phosphorylated at a low level, crossreactivity with pS97, or a combination of both the pT residues and pS97 has not been determined. We next tested the phosphorylation of bacterial proteins by Smk1/Ssp2 in cells that coexpressed the Isc10111-203 or the Isc10146-203 proteins. Although these “minimal YAI” proteins are effective inhibitors of Smk1 autophosphorylation (Fig. 1A), bacterial substrate proteins are still phosphorylated on T and Y residues (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). The low Smk1 activity toward trans-substrates when full-length Isc10 is expressed and high Smk1 activity toward trans-substrates when only the YAI is expressed, suggest that a separate motif in Isc10 plays a role in inhibiting Smk1. The finding that the YAI inhibits autophosphorylation of Y209, but not the phosphorylation of Isc10 or bacterial substrates, suggests that the YAI does not prevent Smk1 from adopting an active kinase conformation. Instead, the YAI specifically inhibits the autophosphorylation of Smk1 (see Discussion). To study the phosphorylation of Isc10 by Smk1 in a more defined system, we used a mutant form of Smk1 in which the “gatekeeper” residue (Q121), that is predicted to limit access to the ATP-binding pocket of the enzyme, was changed to alanine (referred to as smk1-as1 hereafter). In control experiments, the smk1-as1 yeast strain formed spores that appeared indistinguishable from those formed by the WT strain. In the presence of bulky purine (ATP) analogs, the smk1-as1 strain showed a smk1Δ-like phenotype (see Experimental procedures). We coexpressed Smk1-as1 with Ssp2KAD-GST and Cak1 in bacteria, purified the Smk1-as1/Ssp2KAD-GST complex by GSH affinity chromatography, and incubated the purified Smk1-as1/Ssp2KAD-GST with and without MBP-Isc10 in a kinase assay buffer containing the as-specific ATP analog N6-benzyl-ATPγS (6-Bn-ATPγS) (24Allen J.J. Li M. Brinkworth C.S. Paulson J.L. Wang D. Hubner A. et al.A semisynthetic epitope for kinase substrates.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thiophosphates transferred by Smk1-as1 to substrate were next alkylated with p-nitrobenzyl mesylate, and the reactions were analyzed by immunoblot analyses using an antibody that recognizes alkylated thiophosphate. These experiments demonstrate that Smk1-as1/Ssp2 can thiophosphorylate MBP-Isc10 in vitro (compare lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 3C). We previously showed that Smk1/Ssp2 specifically phosphorylates S or T residues in an extended phosphoconsensus motif, Y-X-P-X-S/T-P (14Tio C.W. Omerza G. Phillips T. Lou H.J. Turk B.E. Winter E. Ssp2 binding activates the Smk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase.Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 37 (e00607–16)Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). S97 in Isc10 is contained in a motif that conforms to this phosphoconsensus sequence (Y-I-P-D-S97-P). Moreover, the MS/MS analysis of Isc10 coexpressed with Smk1, Ssp2, and Cak1 in bacteria showed that the major site of phosphorylation is S97 (Fig. 3B and supporting information). Mutation of S97 to alanine eliminated Isc10 thiophosphorylation (compare lanes 4 and 5 in Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that Smk1-as1/Ssp2KAD-GST phosphorylates Isc10 exclusively on S97 in the assay conditions tested. While these data indicate that Smk1/Ssp2 can specifically phosphorylate Isc10 on S97, these experiments do not address whether the thiophosphorylation that was observed in these experiments occurred when Isc10 was part of a ternary complex or when Isc10 was unbound (see later). During these studies, we noticed that Ssp2-GST was also thiophosphorylated. Ssp2 has a motif that conforms to the Smk1 phosphoconsensus except at the -2 position (Y-R-Y-D-T199-P). To test whether T199 in Ssp2 is phosphorylated, Smk1-as1/Ssp2KAD-T199A-GST was purified from bacteria that also expressed Cak1, then analyzed with thiophosphorylation assays. The T199A substitution eliminated detectable thiophosphorylation of Ssp2 without affecting the phosphorylation of MBP-Isc10 (compare lanes 4 and 6 in Fig. 3C). Ssp2KAD-GST is present at higher concentrations than Smk1 in the enzymatic preparations used in these experiments. Therefore, similar to the situation with Isc10, we do not know if the Ssp2 that is phosphorylated is free or stably complexed with Smk1 in the holoenzyme. We also do not know whether Ssp2KAD-GST that has been phosphorylated in bacteria (and is therefore resistant to the addition of thiophosphate in the in vitro reactions) is enriched in the Smk1/Ssp2 complex. Nevertheless, these experiments demonstrate that phosphorylated T199 is not required for Smk1 activity since Smk1/Ssp2-T199A thiophosphorylates MBP-Isc10 similar to Smk1/Ssp2. We next tested whether deletion of the YAI motif influenced the ability of Smk1-as1/Ssp2 to thiophosphorylate Isc10 on S97 using the phosphorylation of Ssp2 on T199 as a control. For these experiments, identical concentrations of MBP fused to residues 1 to 110 or full-length Isc10 were incubated with Smk1-as1/Ssp2KAD-GST and 6-Bn-ATPγS. The products were then alkylated and measured as aforementioned. Although the Isc10 construct lacking the YAI is thiophosphorylated, the reaction takes place at a substantially reduced rate compared to the full-length Isc10 construct (compare lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that the YAI increases the rate of S97 phosphorylation, likely by tethering Isc10 to the Smk1/Ssp2 complex via BD1 and/or 2 and thereby increasing the local concentration of the S97 phosphoconsensus motif. In summary, the data presented in this section demonstrate that Smk1 not only phosphorylates itself (on Y209) but also its activator, Ssp2 (on T199), and its inhibitor, Isc10 (on S97). To gain insight into the role of S97 phosphorylation in regulating Smk1, MBP-Isc10 carrying nonphosphorylatable (A) or phosphomimetic (D) substitutions of S97 were produced with Smk1, Ssp2KAD"

Although previous studies make it increasingly clear that several transcription factors and enzymes are essential to induce browning, it is unclear what dynamic and metabolic changes occur in induction of browning. Here, we analyzed the effect of a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist (CL316243, accelerator of browning) on metabolic change in mice adipose tissue and plasma using metabolome analysis and speculated that browning is regulated partly by inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP) metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether Ucp-1, a functional marker of browning, mRNA expression is influenced by IMP metabolism using immortalized adipocytes. Our study showed that mycophenolic acid, an IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor, increases the mRNA expression of Ucp-1 in immortalized adipocytes. Furthermore, we performed a single administration of mycophenolate mofetil, a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, to mice and demonstrated that mycophenolate mofetil induces adipocyte browning and miniaturization of adipocyte size, leading to adipose tissue weight loss. These findings showed that IMP metabolism has a significant effect on adipocyte browning, suggesting that the regulator of IMP metabolism has the potential to prevent obesity.

These findings showed that IMP metabolism has a significant effect on adipocyte browning, suggesting that the regulator of IMP metabolism has the potential to prevent obesity. Brown adipocyte and beige adipocyte contribute to an enhancement of thermogenesis and prevention of obesity. Recent studies have elucidated the functional and morphological characterization of these adipocytes partially. It is well known that there are three types of adipocytes (white adipocyte, brown adipocyte, and beige adipocyte). Although white adipocyte is unilocular cell and has an ability to store energy as triglyceride, brown adipocyte is multilocular cell and capable of thermogenesis to maintain body temperature under the condition of cold exposure (1Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Brown adipose tissue: function and physiological significance.Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4758) Google Scholar, 2Nedergaard J. Bengtsson T. Cannon B. Unexpected evidence for active brown adipose tissue in adult humans.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E444-E452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). The morphological feature of beige adipocyte is similar to that of brown adipocyte (3Sidossis L. Kajimura S. Brown and beige fat in humans: thermogenic adipocytes that control energy and glucose homeostasis.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The differentiation of beige adipocyte is induced by stimulation of cold exposure or adrenergic agonist treatment (known as ‘browning’) (4Nagase I. Yoshida T. Kumamoto K. Umekawa T. Sakane N.

Kang Q. et al.Beige adipocyte maintenance is regulated by autophagy-induced mitochondrial clearance.Cell Metab. 2016; 24: 402-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This reversible phenomenon is characteristic of beige adipocytes. Previous studies have shown that brown adipose tissue (BAT) is protective against body fat accumulation in humans (8Yoneshiro T. Saito M. Activation and recruitment of brown adipose tissue as anti-obesity regimens in humans.Ann. Med. 2015; 47: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Yoneshiro T. Aita S.

Therefore, the ability of brown adipocyte and beige adipocyte to induce thermogenesis paves the way for effective therapy of obesity-related diseases. Uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) plays a critical role in thermogenesis of brown adipocyte and beige adipocyte and induces miniaturization of adipocytes. It is well known that UCP-1 is activated by the stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptor with its agonists (e.g., CL316243) and/or the activation of sympathetic nerve (e.g., cold exposure) and induces thermogenesis via uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria of these adipocytes (5Kajimura S.

Physiol. 2014; 76: 225-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 6Harms M. Seale P. Brown and beige fat: development, function and therapeutic potential.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1252-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). CL316243 is an adrenergic-β3 receptor agonist, which plays a critical role in the regulation of UCP-1 expression in vivo. The stimulation of beta3-adrenergic receptor in adipocyte induces lipolysis and UCP-1 upregulation via activation of adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A, and hormone-sensitive lipase (6Harms M. Seale P. Brown and beige fat: development, function and therapeutic potential.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1252-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that administration of acetic acid to mice increases mRNA expression level of Ucp-1 and induced miniaturization of adipocyte (10Hanatani S. Motoshima H. Takaki Y. Kawasaki S. Igata M. Matsumura T. et al.Acetate alters expression of genes involved in beige adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and obese KK-Ay mice.J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr. 2016; 59: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although previous studies revealed the presence of several transcription factors and enzymes contributing to differentiation of brown adipocyte and beige adipocyte, it is largely unclear what metabolic pathway plays a key role in induction of brown adipocyte and beige adipocyte via UCP-1 upregulation. In the previous studies, it has been reported that PR domain containing protein 16, one of the transcription factors, is essential to differentiate into brown adipocyte (11Kajimura S. Seale P. Kubota K. Lunsford E. Frangioni J.V. Gygi S.P. et al.Initiation of myoblast to brown fat switch by a PRDM16-C/EBP-beta transcriptional complex.Nature. 2009; 460: 1154-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and that differentiation into beige adipocyte is inhibited by knockdown or KO of PR domain containing protein 16 (12Ohno H.

PPARγ agonists induce a white-to-brown fat conversion through stabilization of PRDM16 protein.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Furthermore, proteome analysis revealed that UCP-1 upregulation and browning of white fat is induced by knockdown of casein kinase 2 α1 (13Shinoda K. Ohyama K. Hasegawa Y. Chang H.-Y. Ogura M. Sato A. et al.Phosphoproteomics identifies CK2 as a negative regulator of beige adipocyte thermogenesis and energy expenditure.Cell Metab. 2015; 22: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that branched chain amino acid catabolism in brown adipocyte contributes to thermogenesis (14Yoneshiro T. Wang Q. Tajima K. Matsushita M. Maki H. Igarashi K. et al.BCAA catabolism in brown fat controls energy homeostasis through SLC25A44.Nature. 2019; 572: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that cinnamon extract has a browning activity in adipocytes via UCP-1 upregulation (15Kwan H.Y. Wu J. Su T. Chao X.J. Liu B. Fu X. et al.Cinnamon induces browning in subcutaneous adipocytes.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that several primary metabolites and phytochemical contribute to activation of brown adipocyte and beige adipocyte. On the other hand, the relationship between browning and metabolic changes in adipocyte remains poorly understood. Metabolome analysis is essential for overview analysis of metabolic variance. Over the past decade, metabolome analysis based on liquid chromatography coupled with ultra-accurate mass spectrometer is applied to investigation of animals (16Soga T. Baran R. Suematsu M. Ueno Y.

Metabolome analysis makes it possible to determine molecular formula provided by exact mass data and speculate on compound structure by metabolite database. Therefore, metabolome analysis is effective approach for comprehensive analysis and monitoring of phytochemical or animal metabolites. In the recently, mass spectrometry (MS)–based lipidomes of adipocytes showed that white adipocytes differed from beige and brown adipocytes in their lipid class and species profile, and this study identified that beta-adrenergic stimulation induces lysophosphatidylcholine in brown adipocytes leading to alteration of mitochondrial bioenergetics (24Schweizer S. Liebisch G. Oeckl J. Hoering M. Seeliger C. Schiebel C. et al.The lipidome of primary murine white, brite, and brown adipocytes-impact of beta-adrenergic stimulation.PLoS Biol. 2019; 17e3000412Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several previous studies using metabolome analysis revealed that the exposure to cold or treatment with CL316243 induces the change of metabolomic profiling in brown and beige adipose tissue (25Mills E.L. Pierce K.A. Jedrychowski M.P. Garrity R. Winther S.

Biochem. 2019; 120: 821-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These findings showed that metabolome analysis is needed to better understand how metabolic change is reflected in adipocyte browning. Our study aimed to find out metabolic pathway contributing induction of brown adipocyte and beige adipocyte. We performed metabolome analysis of mice adipose tissue and plasma metabolites treated with or without beta-adrenergic stimulation. In this analysis, we estimate that adipocyte browning is regulated by inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP) metabolism. We showed that an administration of IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor to mice contributes to the upregulation of Ucp-1 mRNA expression and miniaturization adipocyte size, leading to adipose tissue weight loss. Our findings showed that IMP metabolic pathway contributes to regulation of adipocyte browning. We hypothesized that endogenous metabolite that regulates browning is identified by the analysis of mice treated with or without adrenergic agonist. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of CL316243, a selective β3-adrenoceptor agonist, on browning and metabolism. We analyzed the effect of CL316243 on body and adipose tissues weight, cell size, and browning of murine adipocyte. There were no significant differences in body weight among control and CL316243, an adrenergic receptor agonist, treatment group animals (Table 1). In the individual adipose tissues weight, although BAT was increased, epididymal adipose tissue (EWAT) was decreased by CL316243 treatment (Table 1). CL316243 had a tendency to decrease inguinal adipose tissue (IWAT) weight (Table 1). CL316243 had an ability to decrease adipocyte size (Fig. 1, A–D) and increase the mRNA expression of Ucp-1 in the individual adipose tissues (Fig. 1E). IWAT treated with CL316243 was the maximum change ratio of Ucp-1 mRNA expression among IWAT, EWAT, and BAT (Fig. 1E). Histological analysis suggested that CL316243 leads to a substantial increase in UCP-1 expression in the individual adipose tissues (Fig. 1F).Table 1Effect of CL316243 on body and adipose tissue weightWeightControlCL316243Body (g)24.1 ± 0.823.7 ± 0.9BAT (mg)39.2 ± 6.046.9 ± 4.5∗IWAT (mg)280.3 ± 45.4232.6 ± 25.5EWAT (mg)292.3 ± 47.3172.0 ± 38.9∗Data is expressed as means ± SD (n = 6–7/group). ∗p < 0.05 versus control group. Open table in a new tab Data is expressed as means ± SD (n = 6–7/group). ∗p < 0.05 versus control group. We performed metabolomic analysis of mice adipose tissue and plasma treated with CL316243 in order to search for metabolites associated with browning. At first, we analyzed the influence of CL316243 treatment on detected peaks in adipose tissue and plasma (Dataset S1). Among them, the change ratio of detected peaks was highest in IWAT (Fig. 2A). Approximately 3.4%, 7.3%, 8.3%, and 0.6% of detected peaks were changed in BAT, EWAT, IWAT, and plasma, respectively (Fig. 2A). In principal component analysis of metabolic profiling, it is difficult to be distinguished between control and CL316243 treatment group in each adipose tissue (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the number of IWAT-specific changed peaks was maximum in significant different peak between control and CL316243 treatment group (Fig. 2, C and D). Next, compound name of detected peaks was estimated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database based on exact mass data. About 1624 compounds were estimated (Dataset S2) and classified as ‘Amino acids group’, ‘Carbohydrates groups’, ‘Hormones and transmitters group’, ‘Lipids group’, ‘Nucleic acids group’, ‘Vitamins and cofactors group’, and ‘Others group’ (Fig. 3A). Among metabolite groups except for others group, metabolites of amino acids group including branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) were especially increased by CL316243 treatment in the individual adipose tissue (Fig. 3B and Dataset S3). Remarkably, metabolites of nucleic acids group in IWAT and EWAT were increased by CL316243 treatment (INC-5, INC-6, and INC-7 group, Fig. 3, C and D). On the other hand, lipid changes took significant proportion in the decreased metabolites (Fig. 3, B and D). In order to better understand the information of compound structure, MS2 spectrums were analyzed by mzCloud database. The 36, 3, 53, and 9 peaks’ name of amino acids group, lipids group, nucleic acids group, and vitamins and cofactors group, respectively, were estimated by MS2 spectrums data (Dataset S2, Figs. S1, and 4A). We analyzed the effect of CL316243 treatment on purine metabolism (Dataset S4 and Fig. 4B). KEGG and mzCloud database analysis suggested that IMP metabolism in IWAT and EWAT is strongly influenced by CL316243 (Dataset S4 and Fig. 4B). We tested the hypothesis that adrenergic agonist activates IMP metabolism in vitro. Isoproterenol (Iso), an artificial catecholamine and an adrenergic receptor agonist used as a positive regulator of Ucp-1 in cultured cells in general, induced not only cAMP (Fig. 5A) but also IMP (Fig. 5B) in immortalized adipocytes. We confirmed that the mRNA expression of Ucp-1 is increased by Iso treatment (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, we demonstrated that mycophenolic acid (MPA), an IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor, not only induces IMP (Fig. 5E) but also increases cAMP (Fig. 5D) and the mRNA expression of Ucp-1 (Fig. 5F) in immortalized adipocytes. To test whether IMP metabolism regulates browning, we performed an administration of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a prodrug of MPA, to mice. There were no significant differences in body and BAT weight among control and MMF treatment group animals (Table 2). MMF had no effect on food intake (control group: 4.40 ± 0.52 g/day; MMF group: 4.03 ± 0.91 g/day; p = 0.66). On the other hand, IWAT and EWAT weight were decreased by MMF treatment (Table 2). We investigated the effect of MMF on plasma glucose, triglyceride (TG), and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) level and showed that plasma glucose level tends to be decreased by MMF treatment (Table S1). MMF had no effect on plasma TG and NEFA level (Table S1). In addition, we also showed that MMF has no effect on plasma glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) level (Table S1). We showed that the mRNA expression of Ucp-1 in the individual adipose tissues is increased by MMF treatment (Fig. 6A). We investigated the effect of MMF on other markers of thermogenesis (Pgc1a), brown/beige adipocyte identity (Cidea and Prdm16), and general adipogenesis (Pparγ, aP2, and Adiponectin). Although Cidea expression level tended to be increased by MMF treatment, the mRNA expressions of these markers were not influenced by MMF treatment statistically (Fig. S2). Histological analysis suggested that MMF leads to a substantial increase in UCP-1 expression especially in BAT and IWAT (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, we demonstrated that MMF has an ability to decrease adipocyte size in the individual adipose tissues (Fig. 6, C–F). MMF had no effect on adenosine, the known browning activator, level in adipose tissue (Table S2).Table 2Effect of MMF on body and adipose tissue weightWeightControlMMFBody (g)24.9 ± 0.224.2 ± 1.1BAT (mg)59.3 ± 33.557.0 ± 3.4IWAT (mg)300.7 ± 41.4243.0 ± 16.9∗EWAT (mg)373.3 ± 35.9266.0 ± 53.9∗Data is expressed as means ± SD (n = 3–4/group). ∗p < 0.05 versus Control group. Open table in a new tab Data is expressed as means ± SD (n = 3–4/group). ∗p < 0.05 versus Control group. We investigated the direct effect of Impdh-1 and Impdh-2 gene on Ucp-1 mRNA expression levels using HB2 adipocytes, which are brown adipocyte originated from p53 KO mice. The mRNA expression of Ucp-1 in HB2 adipocytes was also decreased by Impdh-1 and Impdh-2 double-knockdown using siRNA (Fig. S3). We also investigated the effect of cold exposure on Impdh mRNA expression level in mice IWAT. We confirmed that Ucp-1 expression level is increased by cold exposure (Fig. 7A). In addition, we also demonstrated that Impdh-1 expression level is decreased by cold exposure condition (Fig. 7B). The cold exposure had no effect on the mRNA expression level of Impdh-2 (Fig. 7C). In the principal component analysis of control group, PC1 axis distinguished between BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT) (IWAT and EWAT). PC2 axis distinguished between IWAT and EWAT. On the other hand, the adipose tissues treated with CL316243 were not distinguished by PC1 and PC2 axes, suggesting that metabolic profile of WAT is changed by browning. IWAT in mice treated with CL316243 was not only the maximum change ratio of Ucp-1 mRNA expression but also maximum change of metabolites among IWAT, EWAT, and BAT. In the previous study, it has been reported that an administration of CL316243 on mice reduces WAT weight and adipocyte size, and these phenomena were partly abolished by UCP-1 KO (27Inokuma K. Okamatsu-Ogura Y. Omachi A. Matsushita Y. Kimura K. Yamashita H. et al.Indispensable role of mitochondrial UCP1 for antiobesity effect of beta3-adrenergic stimulation.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E1014-E1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), supporting our findings. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of CL316243 on metabolism in adipose tissue and revealed that the maximum number of significant different peak between control and CL316243 treatment group is IWAT in each adipose tissue and plasma. Our data suggested that the effect of CL316243 on nucleic acids metabolism of IWAT and EWAT is larger than that of BAT. Further investigations are needed in order to reveal the difference of the effect of CL316243 on these adipose tissues. We showed that BCAAs are increased by CL316243 treatment. It has been reported that BCAAs contributes to thermogenesis via UCP-1 (14Yoneshiro T. Wang Q. Tajima K. Matsushita M. Maki H. Igarashi K. et al.BCAA catabolism in brown fat controls energy homeostasis through SLC25A44.Nature. 2019; 572: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), supporting our data. CL316243 is an adrenergic-β3 receptor agonist and contributes to enhancement of lipid metabolism. Our metabolome data showed that lipid changes take significant proportion in the decreased metabolites, suggesting the effect of CL316243 on lipid metabolism. It was demonstrated that adrenergic agonist induces not only upregulation of Ucp-1 mRNA but also that of IMP in adipocyte. Previous study has been reported that adrenergic agonist increases Ucp-1 mRNA expression via upregulation of cAMP concentration in adipocyte (6Harms M. Seale P.

Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2012; 2: 102PubMed Google Scholar), supporting our data. Our study showed that IMP in adipocytes is also increased by adrenergic agonist, suggesting the participation of IMP in regulation of UCP-1 expression. To test this hypothesis, MPA was used to evaluate the effect of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) on Ucp-1 mRNA expression in adipocyte. IMPDH catalyzes the oxidation of IMP to xanthosine monophosphate, which is the pivotal step in the biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides (30Crabtree G.W. Henderson J.F.

Biochemical strategy of cancer cells and the design of chemotherapy: G. H. A. Clowes Memorial Lecture.Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3466-3492PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that MPA is a potent and specific inhibitor of IMPDH (34Farazi T. Leichman J. Harris T. Cahoon M. Hedstrom L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 961-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Hedstrom L. IMP dehydrogenase: structure, mechanism, and inhibition.Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 2903-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Our study revealed that MPA contributes to upregulation of cAMP and Ucp-1 mRNA expression in murine adipocytes. These data supported our hypothesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mRNA expression level of Impdh-1 in IWAT is decreased by cold exposure, supporting the hypothesis that the inhibition of IMPDH activity increases UCP-1 expression. This finding suggests the existence of a regulation mechanism of UCP-1 expression in adipose tissue via IMPDH under physiological condition. On the other hand, it remains unknown whether IMP has a direct and/or indirect action of Ucp-1 mRNA upregulation. At first, we tried to decrease the mRNA expression level of Impdh using the immortalized adipocytes and siRNA knockdown approach. However, the knockdown efficiency was very low using the immortalized adipocytes. Next, we investigated the direct effect of Impdh-1 and Impdh-2 gene on adipocyte browning using HB2 cells and siRNA knockdown approach. HB2 cells are pre–brown adipocyte originated from p53 KO mice and useful for in vitro studies of BAT and UCP functions (36Irie Y. Asano A. Cañas X. Nikami H. Aizawa S. Saito M. Immortal brown adipocytes from p53-knockout mice: differentiation and expression of uncoupling proteins.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HB2 cells differentiate into brown adipocytes after induction of differentiation. Although this alternative method solved the problem of knockdown efficiency, the mRNA expression of Ucp-1 in HB2 adipocytes was decreased by Impdh-1 and Impdh-2 double knockdown, suggesting that Ucp-1 expression level is influenced by IMPDH activity. However, these data does not support our data including the immortalized adipocytes and administration of MMF to mice. The results using the immortalized adipocytes provide support for the results of in vivo experiments. The immortalized adipocytes obtained from WAT differentiate into beige/brite cells (37Aune U.L. Ruiz L. Kajimura S. Isolation and differentiation of stromal vascular cells to beige/brite cells.J. Vis. Exp. 2013; https://doi.org/10.3791/50191Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HB2 cells were obtained from BAT (36Irie Y. Asano A. Cañas X. Nikami H. Aizawa S. Saito M. Immortal brown adipocytes from p53-knockout mice: differentiation and expression of uncoupling proteins.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, the difference between HB2 adipocyte’s data and the immortalized adipocyte’s data might be attributed to differences in the cell type. In the previous study, it has been reported that adenosine activates BAT and beige adipocytes via adenosine receptor (38Gnad T. Scheibler S. von Kügelgen I. Scheele C. Kilić A. Glöde A. et al.Adenosine activates brown adipose tissue and recruits beige adipocytes via A2A receptors.Nature. 2014; 516: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Adenosine is one of metabolites of IMP. Therefore, we investigated the effect of MMF administration on adenosine level in adipose tissue in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying IMPDH-regulated adipocyte browning. MMF had no effect on adenosine level in adipose tissue, suggesting that MMF induces the expression of Ucp-1 via adenosine-independent pathway. T1R families and adenylosuccinate synthetic pathway may be the possible involvement in the molec"
https://openalex.org/W4294631118,"AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) proteases unfold substrate proteins by pulling the substrate polypeptide through a narrow pore. To overcome the barrier to unfolding, substrates may require extended association with the ATPase. Failed unfolding attempts can lead to a slip of grip, which may result in substrate dissociation, but how substrate sequence affects slippage is unresolved. Here, we measured single molecule dwell time using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, scoring time-dependent dissociation of engaged substrates from bacterial AAA+ ATPase unfoldase/translocase ClpX. Substrates comprising a stable domain resistant to unfolding and a C-terminal unstructured tail, tagged with a degron for initiating translocase insertion, were used to determine dwell time in relation to tail length and composition. We found greater tail length promoted substrate retention during futile unfolding. Additionally, we tested two tail compositions known to frustrate unfolding. A poly-glycine tract (polyG) promoted release, but only when adjacent to the folded domain, whereas glycine-alanine repeats (GAr) did not promote release. A high complexity motif containing polar and charged residues also promoted release. We further investigated the impact of these and related motifs on substrate degradation rates and ATP consumption, using the unfoldase-protease complex ClpXP. Here, substrate domain stability modulates the effects of substrate tail sequences. polyG and GAr are both inhibitory for unfolding, but act in different ways. GAr motifs only negatively affected degradation of highly stable substrates, which is accompanied by reduced ClpXP ATPase activity. Together, our results specify substrate characteristics that affect unfolding and degradation by ClpXP."
https://openalex.org/W4294795719,"Circular single stranded DNA viruses (CRESS DNA) encoding a homologous replication-associated protein (REP) have been identified in most of eukaryotic groups. It is not clear yet the role in human diseases or details of the life cycle of these viruses. Recently, much interest has been raised in the evolutionary history of CRESS DNA owing to the increasing number of new sequences obtained by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) in distinct host species. In this study we describe two full-length CRESS DNA genomes obtained of two newly diagnosed HIV patients from São Paulo State, Brazil. The initial BLASTx search indicated that both sequences (named SP-FFB/2020 and SP-MJMS/2020) are highly similar (98%) to a previous CRESS DNA sequence detected in human fecal sample from Peru in 2016 and designated as pecovirus (Peruvian stool-associated circo-like virus). This study reported for the first time the Human feces pecovirus in the feces of two newly diagnosed HIV patients in Brazil. Our comparative analysis showed that although pecoviruses in South America share an identical genome structure they diverge and form distinct clades. Thus, we suggest the circulation of different species of pecoviruses in Latin America. Nevertheless, further studies must be done to examine the pathogenicity of this virus."
https://openalex.org/W4294797996,"Background Delayed puberty is a possible complication of Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), though the actual incidence is still unknown. In chronic illnesses delayed puberty should be correctly managed since, if untreated, can have detrimental effects on adult height attainment, peak bone mass achievement and psychological health. Aims and methods This is a single-centre study on pubertal development, growth and bone status in EB. Auxological, densitometric (areal Bone Mineral Density-aBMD Z-score, Bone Mineral Apparent Density-BMAD Z-score, Trabecular Bone Score-TBS and Bone Strain Index-BSI at Lumbar spine) and body composition data (Total Body DXA scans) were collected. Disease severity was defined according to Birmingham Epidermolysis Bullosa Severity (BEBS) score. Results Twenty-one patients (12 Recessive Dystrophic EB-RDEB, 3 Dominant Dystrophic EB, 3 Junctional EB-JEB, 2 EB Simplex and one Kindler EB) aged 13 years (females) or 14 years (males) and above were enrolled (age 16.2±2.5 years, M/F 11/10). Short stature was highly prevalent (57%, mean height -2.12±2.05 SDS) with 55% patients with height &lt;-2SD their mid-parental height. 7/21 patients (33%, 6 RDEB and 1 JEB) had delayed puberty with a median BEBS of 50 (range 29 to 63), a height SDS of -2.59 SDS (range -5.95 to -2.22) and a median lumbar BMAD Z-score of -4.0 SDS (range -5.42 to -0.63 SDS). Pubertal status was negatively associated with BEBS, skin involvement, inflammatory state and positively with height SDS and BMI SDS. Conclusions Pubertal delay is highly prevalent in EB, especially in patients with RDEB and JEB, high severity score and inflammatory state. Moreover, pubertal delay worsens growth impairment and bone health. A study on pubertal induction is ongoing to enlighten possible beneficial effects on adult height attainment and peak bone mass accrual."

Cross-sectional study carried out between 2019 and 2020 with 450 farmers in Rio Grande do Norte. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was evaluated using the Beck Suicidal Ideation Inventory, and sociodemographic, health, income, work and alcohol abuse variables were analyzed. The Chi-square test was used to compare the proportions of the outcome between the categories of each variable. Poisson regression with robust variance was used to analyze associated factors and estimate prevalence ratios [PR]. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 12.4% [95%CI 9.69-15.84] and, in the bivariate analysis, it was associated with sociodemographic, health, income and work variables. In the final multivariate model, the variables that remained significant and were associated with a higher prevalence of SI were: female gender [PR = 3.28], diagnosis of mental disorder in the family [PR = 2.37], presence of common mental disorder [PR = 2.50], alcohol abuse [PR = 2.22] and employment relationship-salaried or temporary [R = 1.91]. Thus, suicidal ideation among farmers is mainly associated with health aspects, especially mental health, work and the female sex, and signals the need to strengthen public policies for suicide prevention with the targeting of effective strategies for the farmers."
