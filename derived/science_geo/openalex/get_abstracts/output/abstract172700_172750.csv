To clarify the mechanism of the depigmenting property of hydroxystilbene compounds, inhibitory actions of oxyresveratrol and its analogs on tyrosinases from mushroom and murine melanoma B-16 have been elucidated in this study. Oxyresveratrol showed potent inhibitory effect with an IC50 value of 1.2 μm on mushroom tyrosinase activity, which was 32-fold stronger inhibition than kojic acid, a depigmenting agent used as the cosmetic material with skin-whitening effect and the medical agent for hyperpigmentation disorders. Hydroxystilbene compounds of resveratrol, 3,5-dihydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene, and rhapontigenin also showed more than 50% inhibition at 100 μm on mushroom tyrosinase activity, but other methylated or glycosylated hydroxystilbenes of 3,4′-dimethoxy-5-hydroxystilbene, trimethylresveratrol, piceid, and rhaponticin did not inhibit significantly. None of the hydroxystilbene compounds except oxyresveratrol exhibited more than 50% inhibition at 100 μm on l-tyrosine oxidation by murine tyrosinase activity; oxyresveratrol showed an IC50 value of 52.7 μm on the enzyme activity. The kinetics and mechanism for inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase exhibited the reversibility of oxyresveratrol as a noncompetitive inhibitor withl-tyrosine as the substrate. The interaction between oxyresveratrol and tyrosinase exhibited a high affinity reflected in aKi value of 3.2–4.2 × 10−7m. Oxyresveratrol did not affect the promoter activity of the tyrosinase gene in murine melanoma B-16 at 10 and 100 μm. Therefore, the depigmenting effect of oxyresveratrol works through reversible inhibition of tyrosinase activity rather than suppression of the expression and synthesis of the enzyme. The number and position of hydroxy substituents seem to play an important role in the inhibitory effects of hydroxystilbene compounds on tyrosinase activity.

The enzyme oxidizes phenols and diphenols using a catalytic mechanism that depends on the presence of copper atoms at the active site (3Olivaries C. Garcia-Borron J.C. Solano F.

Dopaquinone produced by tyrosinase is nonenzymatically converted to dopachrome, which is acted upon by an isomerase producing dihydroxyindoles (5Kuriyama T. Fujinaga M. Koda T. Nishihara J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 6April C.S. Jackson I.J. Kidson S.H. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 219: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Melanin pigments are eventually produced by further oxidation and polymerization of the indoles (7Riley P.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1235-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Tyrosinase, an enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step for the biosynthetic pathway of melanin pigments, is widely distributed in nature. It exists in many organisms with slightly different forms. The enzyme participates in several important reactions of host defense, wound healing, and sclerotization in insects and other arthropods (8Gillespie J.P. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 43: 611-643Crossref Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 9Marmaras V.J. Charalambidis N.D. Zervas C.G. Arch. Insect Biochem.

Encapsulation and melanization of invading foreign organisms in insects are associated with an enzyme cascade in which the terminal component is tyrosinase (11Pye A.E.

Loss of blood in insects during wounding is prevented by melanin deposition at the damaged site (14Parkinson N. Smith I. Weaver R. Edwards J.P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Tyrosinase in association with other enzymes generates reactive intermediates leading to cross-linking of structural proteins and chitin to form hardened cuticle, which is a vital process for the survival of insects and anthropods (15Sugumaran M. Giglio L. Kundzicz H. Saul S. Semensi V. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 19: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol.

Thereby tyrosinase is one of the most important enzymes in the insect molting process, and thus its inhibitors may be used as alternative insect control agents. Tyrosinase is also responsible for the undesired enzymatic browning of food products originating from plant and crustacean that takes place during postharvest handling, which causes a decrease in market value (19Galeazzi M.A. Arch. Latinoam. Nutr. 1984; 34: 269-289PubMed Google Scholar, 20Perez-Gilabert M. Garcia-Carmona F. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000; 48: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Kubo I. Kinst-Hori I. Chaudhuri S.K. Kubo Y. Sanchez Y. Ogura T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000; 8: 1749-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Therefore, novel tyrosinase inhibitors are of great concern to food technologists and processors (22Seo B. Yun J. Lee S. Kim M. Hwang K. Kim J. Min K.R. Kim Y. Moon D. Planta Med. 1999; 65: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Kubo I. Yokokawa Y. Kinst-Hori I. J. Nat.

In animals, melanin pigments are produced by melanocytes and deposited throughout the epidermis, which is the determinant of skin color (25Mills A.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26PerezBernal A. Munoz-Perez M.A. Camacho F. Am. J. Clin.

Pigm. Cell Res. 2000; 13: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). However, disturbances in the amount and distribution of melanin pigments might ultimately provide clues to several diseases. Albinism is a genetic abnormality caused by deficiency in melanin biosynthesis, which manifests as hypopigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes (29Oetting W.S. King R.A. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Hypopigmentation in the skin is associated with sensitivity to UV radiation and predisposition to skin cancer. However, abnormal accumulation of melanin pigments is responsible for hyperpigmentations including melasma, freckles, and senile lentigines, which show satisfactory subjective improvement by treatment with depigmenting agents such as hydroquinone, ascorbic acid derivatives, azelaic acid, retinoids, arbutin, kojic acid, and others (30Guevara I.L. Pandya A.G. Int. J. Dermatol. 2001; 40: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Nguyen Q.H. Bui T.P. Int. J.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 765-769PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, kojic acid (5-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-4H-pyran-4-one) is an antibiotic produced by many species of Aspergillus andPenicillium in the aerobic process (34Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto K. Tsuru D. J. Biochem. 1985; 97: 1747-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Kojic acid, a good chelator of transition metal ions such as Fe3+ and Cu2+, is a safe and mild agent for treating hyperpigmentation disorders and has been extensively used as a cosmetic agent with skin-whitening effect (35Battaini G. Monzani E. Casella L. Santagostini L. Pagliarin R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 36Canabas J. Chazarra S. Garcia-Carmona F. J. Pharm.

Morus alba Linne, a crude drug in Korea, has shown potent depigmenting activity, and oxyresveratrol (2′,3,4′,5-tetrahydroxystilbene) was identified as the principle ingredient in our previous study (38Shin N.-H. Lee K.S. Kang S.-H. Min K.R. Lee S.-H. Kim Y. Nat. Prod. Sci. 1997; 3: 111-121Google Scholar, 39Shin N.-H. Ryu S.Y. Choi E.J. Kang S.-H. Chang I.-M. Min K.R. Kim Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanism of the depigmenting property of the hydroxystilbene compound, inhibitory actions of oxyresveratrol and its analogs on tyrosinase activity and its gene expression have been elucidated in this study. Hydroxystilbene compounds in Fig.1 were isolated from various herbal extracts or obtained by chemical modification in a previous work (40Ryu S.Y. Han Y.N. Han B.H. Arch. Pharm. Res. 1988; 11: 230-239Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Oxyresveratrol was isolated from M. alba Linne, and resveratrol was isolated from Veratrum album var.grandiflorum Maxim. 3,5-Dihydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene, rhapontigenin, and rhaponticin were purified from Rheum undulatum Linne, and piceid was purified from Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. 3,4′-Dimethoxy-5-hydroxystilbene was obtained by methylation of piceid followed by acid hydrolysis, and trimethylresveratrol was obtained by methylation of resveratrol with diazomethane. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from HyClone, and a luciferase assay kit was obtained from Promega. All other reagents and materials were purchased from Sigma or from sources reported previously (38Shin N.-H. Lee K.S. Kang S.-H. Min K.R. Lee S.-H. Kim Y. Nat. Prod. Sci. 1997; 3: 111-121Google Scholar, 39Shin N.-H. Ryu S.Y. Choi E.J. Kang S.-H. Chang I.-M. Min K.R. Kim Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in DMEM (13.4 mg/ml Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 24 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 143 units/ml penicillin G potassium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, pH 7.1) containing 10% FBS with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. When the cells were confluent, PBS buffer (0.2 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm K2HPO4) containing 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA was added to detach the melanoma cells from a culture dish. The detached cell suspension was 10-fold diluted with DMEM containing 10% FBS and then centrifuged at 250 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After washing with DMEM twice, melanoma cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS, and their numbers were counted by using a microscope. Viability of the melanoma cells was more than 95% in all preparations. The cells were diluted to 2 × 105 cells/culture dish (100 mm in diameter) for passage and then incubated with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 3 days. Mushroom tyrosinase was purchased from Sigma. Murine tyrosinase was prepared from melanoma B-16 cells as described previously with minor modifications (41Iozumi K. Hoganson G.E. Pennella R. Everett M.A. Fuller B.B. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Melanoma cells (2 × 106) were removed from culture dishes and washed once with PBS buffer. The cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5% Triton X-100. The cell suspension was sonicated six times for 30 s each with 1-min intervals and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h to solubilize the tyrosinase. After centrifugation at 50,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and then used as a source of murine tyrosinase. l-Tyrosine oxidation by tyrosinase was spectrophotometrically determined as described previously with minor modifications (38Shin N.-H. Lee K.S. Kang S.-H. Min K.R. Lee S.-H. Kim Y. Nat. Prod. Sci. 1997; 3: 111-121Google Scholar, 39Shin N.-H. Ryu S.Y. Choi E.J. Kang S.-H. Chang I.-M. Min K.R. Kim Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Forty microliters of 25 mml-tyrosine, 80 μl of 67 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), and 40 μl of the same buffer with or without test sample were added to a 96-well plate, and then 40 μl of tyrosinase were mixed. The initial rate of dopachrome formation from the reaction mixture was determined as the increase of absorbance at wavelength 492 nm per min (ΔA492/min) by using a Molecular Devices microplate reader. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximal velocity (Vmax) of tyrosinase were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plot with various concentrations ofl-tyrosine as a substrate. Murine melanoma B-16 cells (6 × 104) transfected with luciferase expression vector pGL2 containing the full-length promoter of murine tyrosinase were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h. After washing with PBS buffer, the cells were incubated with or without test sample for 6 h before harvesting. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined using a luciferase assay system (Promega) following the supplier’s instructions. The light intensity was measured with a Moonlight 2000 luminometer. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Effects on tyrosinase by test samples were represented as inhibition % of {1 − ((sample ΔA492/min)/(control ΔA492/min))} × 100 or control % of ((sample ΔA492/min)/(control ΔA492/min)) × 100. Data were collected as means ± S.E. of three independent tests, and significant differences from the control were analyzed by the Student’st test. Inhibitory effects of hydroxystilbene compounds on mushroom tyrosinase activity have been evaluated (TableI); most of the hydroxystilbene compounds are natural ingredients of oriental herbal medicines of M. alba Linne, V. album var. grandiflorumMaxim, R. undulatum Linne, and P. cuspidatumSieb. et Zucc. All of natural hydroxystilbene compounds except piceid and rhaponticin showed inhibitory effects onl-tyrosine oxidation by mushroom tyrosinase, but synthetic hydroxystilbene compounds did not inhibit the enzyme. Effects on the mushroom tyrosinase activity were 97.3% inhibition at 100 μm and an IC50 value of 1.2 μmby oxyresveratrol, 63.8% at 100 μm and an IC50 value of 54.6 μm by resveratrol, 57.9% at 100 μm and an IC50 value of 78.4 μm by 3,5-dihydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene, 58.7% at 100 μm and an IC50 value of 76.2 μmby rhapontigenin, and 76.7% at 100 μm and an IC50 value of 40.1 μm by kojic acid as a positive control. However, 3,4′-dimethoxy-5-hydroxystilbene, trimethylresveratrol, piceid, and rhaponticin did not show significant inhibitory effects at 100 μm on thel-tyrosine oxidation by mushroom tyrosinase.Table IInhibitory effects on mushroom and murine tyrosinases by hydroxystilbene compoundsCompoundMushroomMurine melanoma B-16Inhibition %IC50Inhibition %IC50μmμmOxyresveratrol97.3 ± 1.61-aSignificant difference from the control is p < 0.001.1.263.3 ± 2.31-aSignificant difference from the control is p < 0.001.52.7Resveratrol63.8 ± 3.81-aSignificant difference from the control is p < 0.001.54.632.7 ± 5.11-aSignificant difference from the control is p < 0.001.>1003,5-Dihydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene57.9 ± 8.51-aSignificant difference from the control is p < 0.001.78.43.7 ± 4.5>1003,4′-Dimethoxy-5-hydroxystilbene<0 ± 0.3>1002.3 ± 2.1>100Trimethylresveratrol<0 ± 1.3>1002.0 ± 4.6>100Piceid10.2 ± 2.1>10024.0 ± 9.8>100Rhapontigenin58.7 ± 0.81-aSignificant difference from the control is p < 0.001.76.22.3 ± 4.5>100Rhaponticin<0 ± 1.3>1007.7 ± 8.4>100Kojic acid76.7 ± 1.11-aSignificant difference from the control is p < 0.001.40.143.0 ± 2.51-aSignificant difference from the control is p < 0.001.>100Effects on each tyrosinase activity are represented as inhibition %, mean ± S.E. of three independent tests at 100 μm.1-a Significant difference from the control is p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab Effects on each tyrosinase activity are represented as inhibition %, mean ± S.E. of three independent tests at 100 μm. Oxyresveratrol, resveratrol, and kojic acid showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the mushroom tyrosinase activity (Fig. 2). Oxyresveratrol exhibited significant inhibitory effects at 1 μm and higher concentrations with 31.1% inhibition at 1 μm, 72.9% at 3 μm, 87.9% at 10 μm, 92.4% at 30 μm, and 97.3% at 100 μm on the l-tyrosine oxidation by mushroom tyrosinase. Resveratrol and kojic acid showed similar levels of inhibitory effects on the enzyme activity with 12.6 and 14.9% inhibitions at 10 μm, 36.8 and 41.4% at 30 μm, and 63.8 and 76.7% at 100 μm, respectively. A kinetic study of l-tyrosine oxidation catalyzed by mushroom tyrosinase was accomplished in the presence of oxyresveratrol or kojic acid (Fig. 3). Oxyresveratrol decreased the Vmax value of mushroom tyrosinase activity but did not change theKm value (Fig. 3A). Kojic acid as a positive control increased the Km value of mushroom tyrosinase activity but did not change the Vmaxvalue (Fig. 3B). As summarized in TableII, the Vmax value (ΔA492/min) of mushroom tyrosinase activity was 4.1 × 10−2, and the Km value was 2.2 mml-tyrosine. Mushroom tyrosinase activity in the presence of oxyresveratrol at 0.5 and 1 μm exhibited the same Km value of 2.2 mm and Vmax values of 1.9 × 10−2 and 1.0 × 10−2, respectively. Therefore, oxyresveratrol was a noncompetitive inhibitor of the mushroom enzyme with the same KEI andKEIS values of 0.32–0.43 μm. Kojic acid at 20 and 40 μm exhibited the sameVmax value of 4.1 × 10−2 andKm values of 4.7 and 6.1 mm, respectively. Therefore, kojic acid was a competitive inhibitor of mushroom tyrosinase with a KEI value of 18–23 μm.Figure 3Lineweaver-Burk plot of mushroom tyrosinase in the presence of oxyresveratrol or kojic acid. Data were obtained as mean values of 1/V, inverse of the increase of absorbance at a wavelength 492 nm per min (ΔA492/min), of three independent tests with different concentrations of l-tyrosine as a substrate. Inhibitors of the enzyme were oxyresveratrol (A) with 1 μm (triangle), 0.5 μm(rectangle), or no oxyresveratrol (circle) and kojic acid (B) with 40 μm(triangle), 20 μm (rectangle), or no kojic acid (circle).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIKinetic parameters of mushroom tyrosinase in the presence of oxyresveratrol or kojic acidInhibitorDoseKmVmaxKiμmmΔA492/minmNone2.2 × 10−34.1 × 10−2Oxyresveratrol0.52.2 × 10−31.9 × 10−24.3 × 10−70.12.2 × 10−31.0 × 10−23.2 × 10−7Kojic acid204.7 × 10−34.1 × 10−21.8 × 10−5406.1 × 10−34.1 × 10−22.3 × 10−5The kinetic parameters were obtained with l-tyrosine as a substrate by using the Lineweaver-Burk plot shown in Fig. 3.Km and Ki values are represented as the molar concentration and Vmax values as the increase of absorbance at wavelength 492 nm per min (ΔA492/min).

The inhibitory effects of hydroxystilbene compounds on tyrosinase activity from murine melanoma B-16 have been investigated (Table I). Oxyresveratrol exhibited 63.3% inhibition at 100 μm and an IC50 value of 52.7 μm on the murine tyrosinase activity. Resveratrol and kojic acid at 100 μmexhibited 32.7 and 43.0% inhibitions, respectively. However, the other hydroxystilbene compounds did not show significant inhibitory effects at 100 μm. Oxyresveratrol exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on l-tyrosine oxidation by the murine tyrosinase but did not inhibit the promoter activity of the enzyme gene (Fig. 4). Oxyresveratrol exhibited significant inhibitory effects at 10 μm and higher concentrations on murine tyrosinase activity (Fig. 4A). Effects of oxyresveratrol on the enzyme activity were 86.0% of the control (100%) at 10 μm, 59.9% at 30 μm, and 36.7% at 100 μm. To identify the effect of oxyresveratrol on the expression of murine tyrosinase gene, a luciferase reporter system was carried out in the murine melanoma B-16 (Fig. 4B). Luciferase activities in the cell lysates treated with oxyresveratrol at 10 and 100 μm were not significantly different from that of the control. Oxyresveratrol showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on l-tyrosine oxidation by tyrosinases from mushroom and murine melanoma B-16 (Figs. 2 and 4). However, the promoter activity for expression and synthesis of tyrosinase was unaffected by the hydroxystilbene compound (Fig. 4). Therefore, oxyresveratrol was an inhibitor of tyrosinase activity but did not suppress the synthesis of tyrosinase. Oxyresveratrol showed a potent inhibitory effect with an IC50 value of 1.2 μm on mushroom tyrosinase activity (Table I). Kojic acid, a well known depigmenting agent, exhibited a 32-fold weaker inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity than did oxyresveratrol in view of the IC50 value. Hydroxystilbene compounds of resveratrol, 3,5-dihydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene, and rhapontigenin also showed more than 50% inhibition at 100 μm on mushroom tyrosinase activity for which their inhibitory potencies were in order of oxyresveratrol >> kojic acid ≅ resveratrol > rhapontigenin ≅ 3,5-dihydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene in view of the IC50 values. Oxyresveratrol (2′,3,4′,5-tetrahydroxystilbene) showed a 45-fold stronger inhibitory effect on mushroom tyrosinase activity than resveratrol (3,4′,5-trihydroxystilbene). Resveratrol showed a stronger inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity than methylated hydroxystilbene compounds of 3,5-dihydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene, 3,4′-dimethyoxy-5-hydroxystilbene, and trimethylresveratrol. Piceid is a glycoside of resveratrol at position 3, and rhaponticin is a glycoside of rhapontigenin at position 3′ (Fig. 1). None of the glycosylated hydroxystilbene compounds showed significant inhibitory effects at 100 μm on mushroom tyrosinase activity (Table I). Therefore, the number and position of hydroxy substituents seem to play an important role in the inhibitory effect of hydroxystilbene compounds on mushroom tyrosinase activity. Oxyresveratrol exhibited a 44-fold weaker inhibitory effect on murine tyrosinase activity than mushroom tyrosinase activity in view of the IC50 value (Table I). None of the hydroxystilbene compounds except oxyresveratrol showed more than 50% inhibition at 100 μm on murine tyrosinase activity. A study of the kinetics and mechanism for inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase exhibited the reversibility of oxyresveratrol as a noncompetitive inhibitor and kojic acid as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme with l-tyrosine as the substrate (Fig. 3). The interaction between oxyresveratrol and tyrosinase exhibited a high affinity reflected in a Ki value of 3.2–4.2 × 10−7m (Table II). However, kojic acid showed 100-fold lower affinity to tyrosinase than did oxyresveratrol. Kojic acid is a good chelator of copper and has been shown to inhibit tyrosinase from various sources including fungi, plants, and animal tissues. Kojic acid has been extensively used as a cosmetic material with excellent skin-whitening effect and as a medical agent treating hyperpigmentation disorders (35Battaini G. Monzani E. Casella L. Santagostini L. Pagliarin R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 36Canabas J. Chazarra S. Garcia-Carmona F. J. Pharm.

The depigmenting action of kojic acid is attributed to an ability to chelate copper at the active site of tyrosinase (35Battaini G. Monzani E. Casella L. Santagostini L. Pagliarin R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Resveratrol, an analog of oxyresveratrol, inhibited the l-tyrosine oxidation by mushroom tyrosinase (42Kang B.-S. Shin N.-H. Lee S.-H. Min K.R. Kim Y. Med. Sci. Res. 1998; 26: 235-237Google Scholar). Resveratrol is known to show an antioxidant activity by chelating copper in several biological systems (43Zou J.G. Huang Y.Z. Chen Q. Wei E.H. Hsieh T.C. Wu J.M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 1089-1096PubMed Google Scholar); a similar property would also be expected in oxyresveratrol. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring phytoalexin produced by some spermatophytes in response to injury and fungal infection (44Fremont L. Life Sci. 2000; 66: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar), is an analog of oxyresveratrol that contains an additional hydroxy group at position 2′ of the stilbene moiety. Resveratrol is well known as an ingredient of red wine and has been extensively studied to show several biological activities of free radical scavenging, alteration of eicosanoid metabolism, inhibition of platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory activity, anticancer activity, and estrogenic activity (45Burkitt M.J. Duncan J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 46Yang C.S. Landau J.M. Huang M.T. Newmark H.L. Annu. Rev.

We have shown here that some hydroxystilbene compounds including oxyresveratrol and resveratrol showed potent inhibitory effect on tyrosinase activity. Our results indicate that the depigmenting effect of oxyresveratrol, the strongest inhibitor of l-tyrosine oxidation by tyrosinases from mushroom and murine melanoma B-16 among hydroxystilbene samples in this study, works through noncompetitive inhibition of tyrosinase activity rather than suppression of the expression and synthesis of tyrosinase.

The cell killing was preceded by the release of cytochromec from the mitochondria. Simultaneous treatment of the cells with wortmannin, cycloheximide, furosemide, cyclosporin A, or decylubiquinone prevented the release of cytochrome c and significantly reduced the loss of viability. Etoposide caused the phosphorylation of p53 within 6 h, an effect prevented by wortmannin, an inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). The activation of p53 by etoposide resulted in the up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, a result that was prevented by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The increase in the content of Bax was followed by the translocation of this protein from the cytosol to the mitochondria, an event that was inhibited by furosemide, a chloride channel inhibitor. Stably transfected L929 fibroblasts that overexpress Akt were resistant to etoposide and did not translocate Bax to the mitochondria or release cytochrome c. Bax levels in these transfected cells were comparable with the wild-type cells. The release of cytochromec upon translocation of Bax has been attributed to induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Cyclosporin A and decylubiquinone, inhibitors of MPT, prevented the release of cytochrome c without affecting Bax translocation. These data define a sequence of biochemical events that mediates the apoptosis induced by etoposide. This cascade proceeds by coupling DNA damage to p53 phosphorylation through the action of DNA-PK. The activation of p53 increases Bax synthesis. The translocation of Bax to the mitochondria induces the MPT, the event that releases cytochrome c and culminates in the death of the cells.

The activation of p53 increases Bax synthesis. The translocation of Bax to the mitochondria induces the MPT, the event that releases cytochrome c and culminates in the death of the cells. Apoptosis is a process that removes unwanted or damaged cells. The biochemical events that mediate apoptotic cell death are generally initiated in one of two ways. In the first instance, death signals are generated at the cell surface. Activation of such cell surface proteins as the tumor necrosis factor-α or Fas receptors initiate an apoptotic cascade. Alternatively, the deprivation of many trophic growth factors that act through an interaction with a plasma membrane receptor can similarly result in apoptotic cell death. Our current understanding of the events that follow activation of either the tumor necrosis factor-α or Fas receptor envisions an initial premitochondrial phase that involves the Bcl-2 family of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and that may or may not require the participation of caspases (1.Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial phase that follows eventuates in the release of cytochrome c and the consequent activation of caspases, enzymes in which action leads to the variety of phenotypic alterations characteristic of apoptotic cell death. The apoptosis consequent to growth factor deprivation is also held to involve an initial phase mediated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins that again results in cytochrome c release from the mitochondria followed by a caspase-mediated effector phase (2.Deshmukh M. Johnson Jr., E.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 3.Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 159-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Signals that result in apoptotic cell death are also generated from within the cell. Staurosporine and taxol are two well known examples of chemicals that induce apoptosis as a result of an interaction with an intracellular target. In most cases, however, the specific target and the earliest events that ensue upon the interaction with the inducing chemical are poorly understood.The best known intracellular target for the induction of apoptosis is, of course, DNA. Physical and chemical agents can damage DNA in a variety of ways and with distinct functional consequences, both immediate and delayed. A number of effects on the integrity of the DNA result in the induction of apoptosis, a response that removes cells that can no longer replicate or that have potentially mutagenic damage. The details as to the mechanism whereby the cell recognizes lesions in the DNA that are not readily repairable and then sets in motion events that result in apoptotic cell death are the subject of considerable research efforts. The most dominant current paradigm places p53 at the center of a process that couples DNA damage to the transcriptional regulation of much of the same pro- and anti-apoptotic machinery that is activated by signals originating from the cell surface.The topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide is an antineoplastic drug that has been widely used to couple DNA damage to apoptosis (4.Mizumoto K. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 890-895PubMed Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II is a nuclear enzyme that functions during both DNA replication and transcription (5.Hande K.R. Eur. J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 1514-1521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II prevents “knots” from forming in DNA by allowing the passage of an intact segment of the helical DNA through a transient double strand break (6.Burden A.D. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II inhibitors such as etoposide stabilize the complex formed by topoisomerase II and the 5′-cleaved ends of the DNA, thus forming stable (nonrepairable) protein-linked DNA double strand breaks (6.Burden A.D. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Cells are apparently able to recognize such DNA damage and, in turn, to eliminate the injured cells by apoptosis.A substantial literature details many specific biochemical events that occur upon induction by etoposide in a variety of cell types of the apoptotic cascade. Importantly, many of the same steps that are proposed to be central to the mediation of apoptotic cell death in other models have also been reported to occur upon treatment with etoposide. In most cases, these reports deal with a relatively limited portion of a clearly multistep process. Accordingly, how these individual events are coupled to more proximal and distal ones is not fully understood. In the present study, we document a number of distinct manipulations that prevent the apoptotic death of L929 fibroblasts in response to treatment with etoposide. In turn, we use the mechanism of action of these manipulations to detail a sequence that proceeds from the damage to DNA, through p53 to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and that eventuates in the apoptotic death of the cell.DISCUSSIONWe have identified five distinct chemicals and one genetic manipulation that significantly reduce cell killing by etoposide. In addition, each of these manipulations prevented a characteristic phenomenon in the evolution of the apoptotic phenotype, namely the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Five distinct biochemical events were identified as the likely respective targets of the action of each of these manipulations. In turn, these events constitute a sequence that proceeds from DNA damage through p53 phosphorylation to Bax up-regulation, its subsequent translocation to the mitochondria with the resultant release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and ultimately, cell death.The topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide causes an accumulation of double strand breaks within the nuclei of cells. These breaks are recognized by the multiprotein complex DNA-dependent protein kinase, or more specifically, the heterodimer of Ku subunits that bind to the double-stranded DNA ends (26.Smith G.C.M. Divecha N. Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). By binding to DNA, Ku recruits and activates the catalytic subunit (26.Smith G.C.M. Divecha N. Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of DNA-PK is a member of the PI3-kinase family (9.McConnell K. Dynan W.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,28.Jackson S.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin significantly reduced the extent of cell killing (Table I). By preventing the DNA-PK catalytic subunit from recognizing the double strand breaks induced by ETO, all downstream manifestations of apoptotic cell death including phosphorylation of p53 are inhibited, thus maintaining the viability of the cells. In the apoptotic cascade, the activation of DNA-PK is pivotal because it provides the necessary link between recognition of DNA damage and the subsequent downstream signaling events.The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a regulator of cell cycle progression and mediator of apoptosis in many cell lines. Activation of p53 occurs through phosphorylation (29.Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In particular, the Ser-15 in p53 of humans (which corresponds to Ser-18 of mouse) is a substrate for phosphorylation by DNA-PK (30.Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 31.Wang Y. Eckhart W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4231-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32.Chao C. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11936-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 occurred after treatment of L929 fibroblasts with 10 μm ETO (Fig. 2 A). By inhibiting DNA-PK (26.Smith G.C.M. Divecha N. Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar), wortmannin prevented the phosphorylation of p53, an effect that, in turn, inhibited the subsequent downstream events that culminate in cell death.It is conceivable that the protection afforded by wortmannin reflects an inhibition of a member of the PI3-kinase family other than DNA-PK. In this regard, it is noteworthy, at least, that the best known member of this family, the PI3-kinase that phosphorylates Akt in the cytosol, is anti-apoptotic (24.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4914) Google Scholar). That is, this PI3-kinase functions in a pathway that prevents apoptosis. Accordingly, inhibition of this kinase by wortmannin potentiates apoptotic cell death (33.Pastorino J.G. Tafani M. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19411-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, the protective effect of wortmannin against cell killing by etoposide in the present study must reflect inhibition of a pro-apoptotic PI3-kinase rather than inhibition of an anti-apoptotic PI3-kinase. In turn, the demonstration here that wortmannin prevents the phosphorylation of p53 is clearly consistent with inhibition of a pro-apoptotic event, namely inhibition of DNA-PK.Phosphorylation of p53 results in the up-regulation of proteins implicated in cell cycle control and apoptosis (34.Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In particular, Bax is a pro-apoptotic protein that is transcriptionally regulated by p53 (11.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 35.Thornborrow E.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15598-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Treatment of L929 fibroblasts with etoposide increased the content of Bax (Fig. 3 A). By inhibiting protein synthesis and thus the increase in the content of Bax, cycloheximide protected against cell killing by ETO (Table I).The pro-apoptotic action of Bax is believed to be mediated by its interaction with the mitochondria, in particular, its insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane (36.Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Whereas overexpression of Bax leads to mitochondrial permeabilization and cell death (37.Pastorino J.G. Chen S-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), evidence suggests that mechanisms in addition to an increase in the content of the protein are necessary for Bax to translocate from the cytosol to the mitochondria (13.Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.-G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). It is suspected that a conformational change in Bax results in the exposure of its N-terminal domain, an event that may free the hydrophobic C-terminal membrane-anchoring domain (14.Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15.Pawlowski J. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16.Belaud-Rotureau M.A. Leducq N. Macouillard Poulletier de Gannes F. Diolez P. Lacoste L. Lacombe F. Bernard P. Belloc F. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for such a Bax conformational change, including an alteration in intracellular pH (an alkalinization of the cytosol) and/or an interaction with the pro-apoptotic protein Bid (38.Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). In this regard, the data presented above suggest that the increase in content of Bax produced by ETO is not sufficient to induce cell killing.Pretreatment of L929 fibroblasts with the chloride channel inhibitor furosemide reduced the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria (Fig. 4 A). Consequently, furosemide prevented the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (Fig. 1) and reduced the extent of cell killing (Table I). Importantly, furosemide did not prevent the increase in the content of Bax. We would argue that, by inhibiting a plasma membrane chloride channel, furosemide alters the ionic strength within the cytosol, an effect that prevents a conformational change in Bax that would otherwise render it susceptible to mitochondrial translocation.The translocation of Bax to the mitochondria in response to treatment with ETO was also prevented by overexpression of Akt (Fig. 6 B), a result that was again reflected in the absence of cytochrome c release (Fig. 6 A) and resistance to cell killing (Table II). Importantly, the cellular content of Bax was not affected by the overexpression of Akt (data not shown). Akt is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates the pro-apoptotic protein Bad (24.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4914) Google Scholar). Upon its phosphorylation, Bad no longer binds to the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X, thereby freeing the latter to bind to Bax and to prevent Bax translocation to the mitochondria.Upon its translocation to the mitochondrion, Bax can cause the release of cytochrome c (12.Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Crittenden T. Lutz R.J. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14681-14686Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 36.Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Bax releases cytochrome c is a matter of some current debate (39.Martinou J.C. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E41-E43Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 40.Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 41.Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We have shown that the release of cytochrome c by Bax from both isolated mitochondria in vitro (18.Pastorino J.G. Tafani M. Rothman R.J. Marcineviciute A. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31734-31739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and from these organelles in the intact cell (37.Pastorino J.G. Chen S-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) is a consequence of the opening of the permeability transition pore. In turn, opening of the permeability transition pore can lead to induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Cyclosporin A and decylubiquinone, inhibitors of the MPT, prevented the release of cytochrome cin L929 fibroblasts treated with ETO (Fig. 1) and reduced the loss of viability (Table I). However, CyA did not prevent cell killing past 24 h (data not shown), because the protective effects of CyA are transient (20.Loeffler M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 21.Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16449Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Whereas CyA is believed to exert its anti-apoptotic effects through binding to cyclophilin D, DUBQ is a potent MPT inhibitor by binding to a ubiquinone binding site that appears to be involved directly in permeability transition pore regulation (19.Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Unlike CyA, DUBQ was able to prevent cell killing by ETO over a 3-day time course (Table I).The various manipulations discussed above that modify the response of L929 fibroblasts to etoposide can be summarized by the sequence presented in Fig. 7. ETO induces the accumulation of DNA double strand breaks that are subsequently recognized by DNA-PK. This multiprotein complex then activates p53 through phosphorylation. Upon activation, p53 causes an increase in the transcription of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Bax undergoes a conformational change and is able to translocate to the mitochondria. This movement of Bax to the mitochondria induces the MPT, an event that results in the release of cytochrome c and culminates with loss of viability of the cells. Apoptosis is a process that removes unwanted or damaged cells. The biochemical events that mediate apoptotic cell death are generally initiated in one of two ways. In the first instance, death signals are generated at the cell surface. Activation of such cell surface proteins as the tumor necrosis factor-α or Fas receptors initiate an apoptotic cascade. Alternatively, the deprivation of many trophic growth factors that act through an interaction with a plasma membrane receptor can similarly result in apoptotic cell death. Our current understanding of the events that follow activation of either the tumor necrosis factor-α or Fas receptor envisions an initial premitochondrial phase that involves the Bcl-2 family of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and that may or may not require the participation of caspases (1.Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial phase that follows eventuates in the release of cytochrome c and the consequent activation of caspases, enzymes in which action leads to the variety of phenotypic alterations characteristic of apoptotic cell death. The apoptosis consequent to growth factor deprivation is also held to involve an initial phase mediated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins that again results in cytochrome c release from the mitochondria followed by a caspase-mediated effector phase (2.Deshmukh M. Johnson Jr., E.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 3.Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 159-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Signals that result in apoptotic cell death are also generated from within the cell. Staurosporine and taxol are two well known examples of chemicals that induce apoptosis as a result of an interaction with an intracellular target. In most cases, however, the specific target and the earliest events that ensue upon the interaction with the inducing chemical are poorly understood. The best known intracellular target for the induction of apoptosis is, of course, DNA. Physical and chemical agents can damage DNA in a variety of ways and with distinct functional consequences, both immediate and delayed.

Topoisomerase II prevents “knots” from forming in DNA by allowing the passage of an intact segment of the helical DNA through a transient double strand break (6.Burden A.D. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II inhibitors such as etoposide stabilize the complex formed by topoisomerase II and the 5′-cleaved ends of the DNA, thus forming stable (nonrepairable) protein-linked DNA double strand breaks (6.Burden A.D. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Cells are apparently able to recognize such DNA damage and, in turn, to eliminate the injured cells by apoptosis. A substantial literature details many specific biochemical events that occur upon induction by etoposide in a variety of cell types of the apoptotic cascade. Importantly, many of the same steps that are proposed to be central to the mediation of apoptotic cell death in other models have also been reported to occur upon treatment with etoposide. In most cases, these reports deal with a relatively limited portion of a clearly multistep process. Accordingly, how these individual events are coupled to more proximal and distal ones is not fully understood. In the present study, we document a number of distinct manipulations that prevent the apoptotic death of L929 fibroblasts in response to treatment with etoposide. In turn, we use the mechanism of action of these manipulations to detail a sequence that proceeds from the damage to DNA, through p53 to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and that eventuates in the apoptotic death of the cell. DISCUSSIONWe have identified five distinct chemicals and one genetic manipulation that significantly reduce cell killing by etoposide. In addition, each of these manipulations prevented a characteristic phenomenon in the evolution of the apoptotic phenotype, namely the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Five distinct biochemical events were identified as the likely respective targets of the action of each of these manipulations. In turn, these events constitute a sequence that proceeds from DNA damage through p53 phosphorylation to Bax up-regulation, its subsequent translocation to the mitochondria with the resultant release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and ultimately, cell death.The topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide causes an accumulation of double strand breaks within the nuclei of cells. These breaks are recognized by the multiprotein complex DNA-dependent protein kinase, or more specifically, the heterodimer of Ku subunits that bind to the double-stranded DNA ends (26.Smith G.C.M. Divecha N. Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). By binding to DNA, Ku recruits and activates the catalytic subunit (26.Smith G.C.M. Divecha N. Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of DNA-PK is a member of the PI3-kinase family (9.McConnell K. Dynan W.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,28.Jackson S.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin significantly reduced the extent of cell killing (Table I). By preventing the DNA-PK catalytic subunit from recognizing the double strand breaks induced by ETO, all downstream manifestations of apoptotic cell death including phosphorylation of p53 are inhibited, thus maintaining the viability of the cells. In the apoptotic cascade, the activation of DNA-PK is pivotal because it provides the necessary link between recognition of DNA damage and the subsequent downstream signaling events.The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a regulator of cell cycle progression and mediator of apoptosis in many cell lines. Activation of p53 occurs through phosphorylation (29.Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In particular, the Ser-15 in p53 of humans (which corresponds to Ser-18 of mouse) is a substrate for phosphorylation by DNA-PK (30.Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 31.Wang Y. Eckhart W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4231-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32.Chao C. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11936-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 occurred after treatment of L929 fibroblasts with 10 μm ETO (Fig. 2 A). By inhibiting DNA-PK (26.Smith G.C.M. Divecha N. Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar), wortmannin prevented the phosphorylation of p53, an effect that, in turn, inhibited the subsequent downstream events that culminate in cell death.It is conceivable that the protection afforded by wortmannin reflects an inhibition of a member of the PI3-kinase family other than DNA-PK. In this regard, it is noteworthy, at least, that the best known member of this family, the PI3-kinase that phosphorylates Akt in the cytosol, is anti-apoptotic (24.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4914) Google Scholar). That is, this PI3-kinase functions in a pathway that prevents apoptosis. Accordingly, inhibition of this kinase by wortmannin potentiates apoptotic cell death (33.Pastorino J.G. Tafani M. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19411-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, the protective effect of wortmannin against cell killing by etoposide in the present study must reflect inhibition of a pro-apoptotic PI3-kinase rather than inhibition of an anti-apoptotic PI3-kinase. In turn, the demonstration here that wortmannin prevents the phosphorylation of p53 is clearly consistent with inhibition of a pro-apoptotic event, namely inhibition of DNA-PK.Phosphorylation of p53 results in the up-regulation of proteins implicated in cell cycle control and apoptosis (34.Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In particular, Bax is a pro-apoptotic protein that is transcriptionally regulated by p53 (11.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 35.Thornborrow E.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15598-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Treatment of L929 fibroblasts with etoposide increased the content of Bax (Fig. 3 A). By inhibiting protein synthesis and thus the increase in the content of Bax, cycloheximide protected against cell killing by ETO (Table I).The pro-apoptotic action of Bax is believed to be mediated by its interaction with the mitochondria, in particular, its insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane (36.Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Whereas overexpression of Bax leads to mitochondrial permeabilization and cell death (37.Pastorino J.G. Chen S-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), evidence suggests that mechanisms in addition to an increase in the content of the protein are necessary for Bax to translocate from the cytosol to the mitochondria (13.Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.-G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). It is suspected that a conformational change in Bax results in the exposure of its N-terminal domain, an event that may free the hydrophobic C-terminal membrane-anchoring domain (14.Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15.Pawlowski J. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for such a Bax conformational change, including an alteration in intracellular pH (an alkalinization of the cytosol) and/or an interaction with the pro-apoptotic protein Bid (38.Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). In this regard, the data presented above suggest that the increase in content of Bax produced by ETO is not sufficient to induce cell killing.Pretreatment of L929 fibroblasts with the chloride channel inhibitor furosemide reduced the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria (Fig. 4 A). Consequently, furosemide prevented the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (Fig. 1) and reduced the extent of cell killing (Table I). Importantly, furosemide did not prevent the increase in the content of Bax. We would argue that, by inhibiting a plasma membrane chloride channel, furosemide alters the ionic strength within the cytosol, an effect that prevents a conformational change in Bax that would otherwise render it susceptible to mitochondrial translocation.The translocation of Bax to the mitochondria in response to treatment with ETO was also prevented by overexpression of Akt (Fig. 6 B), a result that was again reflected in the absence of cytochrome c release (Fig. 6 A) and resistance to cell killing (Table II). Importantly, the cellular content of Bax was not affected by the overexpression of Akt (data not shown). Akt is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates the pro-apoptotic protein Bad (24.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4914) Google Scholar). Upon its phosphorylation, Bad no longer binds to the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X, thereby freeing the latter to bind to Bax and to prevent Bax translocation to the mitochondria.Upon its translocation to the mitochondrion, Bax can cause the release of cytochrome c (12.Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Crittenden T. Lutz R.J. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14681-14686Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 36.Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N.

The mechanism by which Bax releases cytochrome c is a matter of some current debate (39.Martinou J.C. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Nat.

Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) is a consequence of the opening of the permeability transition pore. In turn, opening of the permeability transition pore can lead to induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Cyclosporin A and decylubiquinone, inhibitors of the MPT, prevented the release of cytochrome cin L929 fibroblasts treated with ETO (Fig. 1) and reduced the loss of viability (Table I). However, CyA did not prevent cell killing past 24 h (data not shown), because the protective effects of CyA are transient (20.Loeffler M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 21.Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16449Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Whereas CyA is believed to exert its anti-apoptotic effects through binding to cyclophilin D, DUBQ is a potent MPT inhibitor by binding to a ubiquinone binding site that appears to be involved directly in permeability transition pore regulation (19.Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Unlike CyA, DUBQ was able to prevent cell killing by ETO over a 3-day time course (Table I).The various manipulations discussed above that modify the response of L929 fibroblasts to etoposide can be summarized by the sequence presented in Fig. 7. ETO induces the accumulation of DNA double strand breaks that are subsequently recognized by DNA-PK. This multiprotein complex then activates p53 through phosphorylation. Upon activation, p53 causes an increase in the transcription of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Bax undergoes a conformational change and is able to translocate to the mitochondria. This movement of Bax to the mitochondria induces the MPT, an event that results in the release of cytochrome c and culminates with loss of viability of the cells.

https://openalex.org/W2016906651,"Transfer RNA molecules translate the genetic code by recognizing cognate mRNA codons during protein synthesis. The anticodon wobble at position 34 and the nucleotide immediately 3′ to the anticodon triplet at position 37 display a large diversity of modified nucleosides in the tRNAs of all organisms. We show that tRNA species translating 2-fold degenerate codons require a modified U34 to enable recognition of their cognate codons ending in A or G but restrict reading of noncognate or near-cognate codons ending in U and C that specify a different amino acid. In particular, the nucleoside modifications 2-thiouridine at position 34 (s2U34), 5-methylaminomethyluridine at position 34 (mnm5U34), and 6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 (t6A37) were essential for Watson-Crick (AAA) and wobble (AAG) cognate codon recognition by tRNAUUULys at the ribosomal aminoacyl and peptidyl sites but did not enable the recognition of the asparagine codons (AAU and AAC). We conclude that modified nucleosides evolved to modulate an anticodon domain structure necessary for many tRNA species to accurately translate the genetic code. Transfer RNA molecules translate the genetic code by recognizing cognate mRNA codons during protein synthesis. The anticodon wobble at position 34 and the nucleotide immediately 3′ to the anticodon triplet at position 37 display a large diversity of modified nucleosides in the tRNAs of all organisms. We show that tRNA species translating 2-fold degenerate codons require a modified U34 to enable recognition of their cognate codons ending in A or G but restrict reading of noncognate or near-cognate codons ending in U and C that specify a different amino acid. In particular, the nucleoside modifications 2-thiouridine at position 34 (s2U34), 5-methylaminomethyluridine at position 34 (mnm5U34), and 6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 (t6A37) were essential for Watson-Crick (AAA) and wobble (AAG) cognate codon recognition by tRNAUUULys at the ribosomal aminoacyl and peptidyl sites but did not enable the recognition of the asparagine codons (AAU and AAC). We conclude that modified nucleosides evolved to modulate an anticodon domain structure necessary for many tRNA species to accurately translate the genetic code. tRNA molecules play a significant role in the translation of the genetic code into protein sequences. The ribosome-mediated interaction of the mRNA codons with the anticodon of the tRNA results in the discrimination of cognate versus near-cognate and noncognate codons (1.Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) with the largest diversity of these modifications located in the anticodon wobble at position 34 or immediately 3′ adjacent to the anticodon triplet at position 37.

We had previously reported that modified nucleosides in the anticodon loop of tRNAUUULys were essential for recognition of the lysine codons AAA and AAG. Specifically, 5-methylaminomethyluridine at position 34 (mnm5U34), 1The abbreviations used are: mnm5U345-methylaminomethyluridine at position 34s2U342-thiouridine at position 34t6A376-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37mo5U345-methoxyuridinecmo5U345-carboxymethoxyuridinePpeptidylASLanticodon stem and loop 2-thiouridine at position 34 (s2U34), and 6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 (t6A37) enabled codon recognition at the ribosomal peptidyl (P) site (7.Ashraf S.S.

However, we had not previously compared the P site ribosomal contributions of these modified nucleosides in tRNAUUULys with contributions at the ribosomal A site, the ribosomal entry site for aminoacylated tRNAs during peptide elongation. In addition, it has not been shown whether the same tRNA modifications necessary for cognate codon recognition also restrict wobble recognition of near-cognate codons. 5-methylaminomethyluridine at position 34 2-thiouridine at position 34 6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 5-methoxyuridine 5-carboxymethoxyuridine peptidyl anticodon stem and loop Crick's wobble hypothesis for codon recognition (10.Crick F.H.

The wobble rules proposed by Crick are that U recognizes A and G, C recognizes G, A recognizes U, and G recognizes U and C. Lim and colleagues (11.Lim V.I. J. Mol.

A. 1985; 82: 4905-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) proposed that unmodified U34 could recognize U and C in addition to A and G. The modifications of U34 would restrict wobble recognition to A and G, but 5-oxyuridine modifications at position 34 such as 5-methoxyuridine (mo5U34) and 5-carboxymethoxyuridine (cmo5U34) would allow recognition of U as well as A and G (12.Lim V.I. Curran J.F. RNA. 2001; 7: 942-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, we had previously shown that the unmodified U34 in completely unmodified tRNAUUULys, tRNAUUCGlu, and tRNAUUGGln could not recognize A and G (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, the need for a modified U34 must be to restore and restrict wobble position recognition to A and G. To identify tRNA species that require a modified U34 for codon recognition and restrict wobble specificity of the first anticodon position, we assayed the ability of specific tRNAs to recognize cognate and wobble codons in the absence of their naturally occurring modifications at U34. The 17 nucleotides of the anticodon stem and loop domain (ASL; Fig. 1) were used as a mimic of the entire tRNA molecule to assess codon recognition at the ribosomal A and P sites (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8.Yarian C. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R. Miskiewicz A.

The 30 S ribosomal P site has the highest affinity of all ribosomal sites for entire tRNA molecules and for ASLs. Thus, the P site is first occupied in vitro(18.Lill R. Robertson J.M. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3245-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19.Parfenov D.V. Saminskii E.M. Mol. Biol. (Engl. Transl. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.)). 1993; 27: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar), and binding to the A and P sites does not depend on the presence of initiation or elongation factors (16.Harrington K.M. Nazarenko I.A. Dix D.B. Thompson R.C. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7617-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17.Joseph S. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3478-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here we provide experimental evidence that the need for a modified wobble position, U34, directly correlates to the need for some tRNAs to discriminate at the third position of the codon. We also show that modified nucleosides in tRNA anticodon domain modulate codon recognition in the ribosomal A site similarly to the ribosomal P site. Unmodified and variously modified ASLs and 30-mer mRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and Xeragon (Huntsville, AL) or synthesized using ribonucleoside phosphoramidite chemistries and methods as described previously (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,8.Yarian C. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R. Miskiewicz A. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13390-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). ASLs were 3′-32P end-labeled as described previously (20.Gumport R.I. Uhlenbeck O.C. Gene Amplif. Anal. 1981; 2: 313-345PubMed Google Scholar). Small ribosomal subunits (30 S) were prepared from Escherichia coli MRE600 cells (21.Ericson G. Minchew P. Wollenzien P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and activated by incubating at 37 °C for 30 min in CMN buffer (80 mm potassium cacodylate acid, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 mmNH4Cl). Ribosomal subunits were 70–95% active in all assays. ASLs were bound to the 30 S ribosomal P site as reported previously (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8.Yarian C. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R. Miskiewicz A. Agris P.F.

RNA. 1997; 3: 49-56PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that mixtures of ASL, 30 S subunit, and mRNA were incubated on ice for 1 h before being passed through nitrocellulose membranes. Binding curves were analyzed by one site nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism) with yeast tRNAPhe (Sigma) binding to poly(U) as the positive control. ASLs were bound to 30 S ribosomal subunits with a procedure modified from that previously reported for determining only programmed P site binding (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8.Yarian C. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R. Miskiewicz A. Agris P.F.

Small 30 S ribosomal subunits (10 pmol) and a 30-mer message consisting of 10 consecutive copies of the appropriate triplet codon either in the absence of tetracycline or in the presence of 250 μmtetracycline (Sigma) were incubated with 200 pmol 3′-32P end-labeled ASL in 40 μl of CMN buffer plus 3 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 1 h before being passed through nitrocellulose filters as described previously (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8.Yarian C. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R. Miskiewicz A. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13390-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The total number of ASLs bound to 30 S ribosomal subunits was determined in the experiments without tetracycline. The number of ASLs sensitive to tetracycline was determined by subtracting the number of ASLs bound in the presence of tetracycline from the total number bound in the absence of tetracycline. The standard deviations for A site binding were determined by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the standard deviations for the values in the absence of tetracycline and the presence of tetracycline. All values are averages and standard deviations of at least duplicate experiments. E. coli 30 S ribosomal subunits (10 pmol) were programmed with an appropriate message in CMN buffer either in the absence of tetracycline or in the presence of 250 μm tetracycline in the absence of tRNA or in the presence of 200 pmol of ASL. The mixtures (40 μl) were incubated on ice for 1 h before chemical probing. Chemical modification of 16 S rRNA nucleosides was conducted by adding 2 μl of one-third dimethyl sulfate (Sigma) solution in 100% ethanol as described previously (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8.Yarian C. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R. Miskiewicz A. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13390-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The dimethyl sulfate-modified 16 S rRNA was reverse-transcribed with a 5′-32P end-labeled DNA primer complimentary to bases 1509–1530 to probe A1492 and A1493 and bases 824–845 to probe A794 and C795 in 16 S rRNA as described previously (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8.Yarian C. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R. Miskiewicz A. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13390-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The reverse transcription products were electrophoresed by 6% PAGE/7 m urea. Unmodified ASLs corresponding to the sequences of LysUUU, GluUUC, GlnUUG, ArgUCU, AlaUGC, SerUGA, ValUAC, and ProUGG tRNAs were chemically synthesized and assayed for their ability to bind to 30 S ribosomal subunits programmed with the respective cognate codons. The naturally occurring modifications in the anticodon domains of each of these tRNA species are listed in Table I. The unmodified LysUUU, GluUUC, GlnUUG, ArgUCU, and AlaUGC ASLs did not recognize their cognate codons in the ribosomal P site (Table I). However, the unmodified SerUGA, ValUAC, and ProUGG ASLs recognized their cognate codons (K d = 600 ± 270 nm, 300 ± 100 nm, and 180 ± 60 nm, respectively) (Table I). The inability of an ASL to recognize its cognate codon on the ribosome was not a result of using only the isolated anticodon domain as a tRNA mimic. The completely unmodified transcripts of human tRNAUUULys3, E. colitRNAUUCGlu, and E. colitRNAUUGGln did not recognize their cognate codons on the ribosome (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), although completely modified nativeE. coli tRNAUUULys and tRNAUUCGlu recognized their respective codons (K d = 70 ± 7 and 700 ± 300 nm, respectively) (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). With the incorporation of s2U34 into the otherwise unmodified ASLUUULys, the ASL exhibited a relative binding constant of 105 ± 7 nm for the AAA codon and 200 ± 20 nm for the AAG codon and did not recognize the AAC or AAU codons (Table I).Table ISequences, naturally occurring modified nucleosides, and relative ribosomal P site binding constants for ASL constructsASLNucleotide sequence2-aThe underlined bases in the unmodified sequences correspond to bases in the anticodon stem.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether modified nucleosides have a contribution in the ribosomal A site, we assessed the ability of modifications previously shown to restore programmed ribosomal P site binding (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8.Yarian C. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R. Miskiewicz A. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13390-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to restore programmed A site binding. The binding affinity of the ribosomal A site is ∼100 times lower than that for the P site (18.Lill R. Robertson J.M. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3245-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, to achieve A site binding to the 30 S subunit in vitro as described here, it is necessary to saturate the P site. An additional tRNA exit site on the ribosome, the E site, has also been identified for deacylated tRNAs (22.Parfenov D.V. Saminskii E.M. Mol. Biol. (Engl. Transl. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.)). 1985; 19: 1378-1385PubMed Google Scholar), but the majority of the binding energy for this site appears to be in the 3′-terminal adenosine base of the entire tRNA molecule and the 50 S ribosomal subunit (23.Grajevskaja R.A. Ivanov Y.V. Saminsky E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The binding of various modified ASLUUULys constructs to the programmed A site was inferred by determining the number of ASL constructs sensitive to the presence of tetracycline. In the presence of 250 μm tetracycline, the binding of tRNAs to the ribosomal A site is inhibited (24.Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Carter A.P. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V.

In the presence of tetracycline, ASLUUULys constructs modified with s2U34, mnm5U34, or t6A37 individually and with mnm5U34 and t6A37combined (Table II) bound AAA-programmed 30 S ribosomal subunits effectively (Table II) but measurably lower than the binding observed in the absence of tetracycline. The difference in binding was attributed to binding at the tetracycline-sensitive ribosomal A site (Table II). In addition, ASLUUULys-s2U34and ASLUUULys-mnm5U34t6A37 recognized the AAG codons in the ribosomal A site (Fig. 1). Therefore, modifications that restored P site ribosomal codon recognition also restore codon recognition to the ribosomal A site.Table IIRibosomal A and P-site relative binding efficiencies of unmodified and variously modified ASLUUULys constructsASLUUULysconstructCodon3-a30 S ribosomal subunits were programmed with either poly(A) or a 30-mer message (AAG)10.Relative binding/30 S subunit3-bP site binding was inferred to be ASL binding to 30 S subunits that was not sensitive to tetracycline.

Open table in a new tab To confirm that we were observing A site binding in the absence of tetracycline but not in the presence of tetracycline, we monitored the altered chemical reactivity of 16 S rRNA bases A1492, A1493, A794, and C795 in the presence of the variously modified ASLUUULys. When tRNA is bound in the ribosomal A site, A1492 and A1493 are protected from chemical modification (28.Moazed D. Noller H.F. J. Mol.

ASLUUULys-mnm5U34t6A37and ASLUUULys-mnm5U34protected 16 S rRNA bases A1492 and A1493 from chemical modification in the absence of tetracycline but not in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 2, lanes 3–6). The protection of A site bases was not evident when unmodified ASLUUULys was present (Fig. 2,lanes 7 and 8). The codon binding of the completely unmodified ASLUUULys both in the presence and absence of tetracycline was almost below detection, confirming only minimal codon recognition at either ribosomal binding site (Table II and Fig. 2). To ensure that the presence of tetracycline did not affect P site binding, we monitored the protection of A794 and C795. In the absence of tRNA or in the presence of the unmodified ASLUUULys, the ribosomal bases A794 and C795 were not protected. In the presence of ASLUUULys-mnm5U34t6A37and ASLUUULys-mnm5U34, the P site rRNA bases were protected both in the absence and in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 2). These results confirmed that tetracycline was inhibiting A site binding and not influencing P site binding. Therefore, the ability of modified nucleosides to restore codon recognition at the ribosomal P site is similar to the ability at the ribosomal A site. The work reported here provides experimental evidence for the role of tRNA modified nucleosides in maintaining accurate recognition of the genetic code. Many tRNAs can recognize more than one codon because of the ability of the anticodon wobble at position 34 to wobble to recognize the third position of the codon. These data indicate that modification of U34 is the biochemical mechanism by which tRNA molecules accurately differentiate codons from multiple amino acid codon boxes. Multiple amino acid or mixed codon boxes refer to 2- and 3-fold degenerate codons that specify more than one amino acid by only a difference in the third base (Table III). We have found that the tRNAs that have a U34 and translate codons from mixed codon boxes rely on the U34 modification to enable recognition of A or G in the third position of the codon. tRNAUCUArg, tRNAUUCGlu, tRNAUUGGln, and tRNAUUULys translate codons from multiple amino acid codon boxes, and the corresponding unmodified ASLs did not recognize their cognate codons (Table I). tRNAUGCAla, tRNAUGASer, tRNAUACVal, and tRNAUGGPro all translate codons from single amino acid codon boxes, and all of the corresponding unmodified ASLs with the exception of ASLUGCAlarecognized their cognate codons, although with different affinities (Table I).Table IIIThe genetic codeThe single acid or unmixed codon boxes (not shaded) contain the 4-fold degenerate codons and are translated by tRNAs that do not need to discriminate the third nucleotide of the codon. The other eight boxes (shaded) contain either 2- or 3-fold degenerate codons (also termed multiple amino acid or mixed codon boxes) and are translated by tRNAs that need to discriminate the third nucleotide of the codon.

If a modified U34 is necessary for tRNAs that translate codons from mixed codon boxes to recognize A and G, the modification may also restrict the recognition to A and G. Previously, we reported that the incorporation of the s2U34modification into the otherwise completely unmodified ASLUUULys restored recognition of the lysine codons AAA and AAG (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Whereas this modification restored recognition of the two lysine codons AAA and AAG, it is necessary that the s2U34 modification does not wobble to read AAU and AAC asparagine codons. We assayed the ability of the U34 modification, s2U34, in tRNAUUULys to restrict wobble recognition to A and G. With the incorporation of s2U34 into the otherwise unmodified ASLUUULys, the ASL exhibited a relative binding constant of 105 ± 7 nm for the AAA codon and 200 ± 20 nm for the AAG codon and did not recognize the AAC or AAU codons (Table I). These experimental data support the work of Yokoyama et al. (14.Yokoyama S. Watanabe T. Murao K. Ishikura H. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4905-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and the model proposed by Lim and Curran (12.Lim V.I. Curran J.F. RNA. 2001; 7: 942-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that modifications of U34 are used in tRNAs that translate codons from multiple amino acid codon boxes to not only recognize A and G in the third position of the codon but also to negate the recognition of U and C. The 2-thiopyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides are predominantly found in the C3′-endo conformation to recognize adenosine and to a lesser extent guanosine as the third nucleotide of the codon (14.Yokoyama S. Watanabe T. Murao K. Ishikura H. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4905-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It is absolutely essential that tRNAs reading from multiple amino acid codon boxes be able to discriminate the third position of the codon to ensure translational fidelity. The cmo5U34 modification is present only in tRNAs that read 4-fold degenerate codons. There is no requirement for these tRNAs to discriminate at the third position of the codon, and we have found that these tRNAs do not require a modified U34for cognate codon recognition. For example, unmodified ASLUACVal recognized the valine codons GUA and GUU with high affinity (K d = 300 ± 100 and 260 ± 20 nm, respectively) and displayed low but measurable recognition of the valine codons GUC and GUG (Table I). Therefore, the unmodified U34 in ASLUACVal efficiently recognized an A as the third nucleotide in the codon and surprisingly displayed high affinity to the codon with a U at the third position, a wobble recognition not originally proposed by Crick. It is reasonable that the incorporation of the naturally occurring position 37 modification, m6A37, into ASLUACVal would enhance the recognition of the GUG codon. We had previously reported that the incorporation of both the position 34 and 37 modifications in tRNAUUULys enhanced the recognition of the AAG codon, whereas the singly modified ASLUUULys either at positions 34 or 37 did not recognize the AAG codon (8.Yarian C. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R. Miskiewicz A. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13390-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although the unmodified U34 in some tRNAs with a naturally occurring cmo5U34 modification may be able to recognize A, G, U, and C, the modification of cmo5U34 may restrict the reading of C. Proton NMR analyses indicate that the cmo5U modification takes the C2′-endo form as well as the C3′-endo form to recognize uridine in addition to adenosine and guanosine as the third base of the codon (14.Yokoyama S. Watanabe T. Murao K. Ishikura H. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4905-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). tRNAUGCAla was the only unmodified ASL, which we assayed, that has a naturally occurring cmo5U34 modification and did not recognize its codon (Table I). Interestingly, it is also the only anticodon sequence we have assayed that has the cmo5U34modification without a naturally occurring position 37 modification (Table I). Therefore, the cmo5U34 modification may be necessary to restore codon recognition to ASLUGCAla, whereas the other ASLs with cmo5U34(ASLUGASer, ASLUACVal, and ASLUGGPro) recognized their Watson-Crick base pairing codons but probably require modifications of either position 34 or both positions 34 and 37 to wobble. Although contributions of anticodon tRNA-modified nucleosides have been established (6.Urbonavicius J. Qian Q. Durand J.M. Hagervall T.G. Bjork G.R.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 207-223Google Scholar), we had not previously compared the ability of the anticodon stem and loop constructs to recognize their cognate codons at the ribosomal P and A sites. The ribosomal position that first discriminates cognate from near-cognate and noncognate tRNAs during protein elongation is the ribosomal A site. Previous work has reported contributions of modified nucleosides in the ribosomal A site but not with the site-specific modified ASL constructs. It has been proposed that a hypomodified tRNA may decrease the rate by which the tRNA is recruited to the A site (6.Urbonavicius J. Qian Q. Durand J.M. Hagervall T.G. Bjork G.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4863-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), that a position 37 modification enhances proofreading in the ribosomal A site (29.Diaz I. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and that position 37 modifications influence the in vivoaminacylated tRNA selection in a tRNA-dependent manner (9.Li J. Esberg B. Curran J.F. Bjork G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We determined that modified nucleosides have a contribution in the ribosomal A site similar to our previous observations of codon binding in the ribosomal P site. The modifications previously shown to restore programmed ribosomal P site binding (7.Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8.Yarian C. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R. Miskiewicz A. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13390-13395Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) restored the programmed A site binding. The x-ray crystallographic structures of the 30 S ribosomal subunit (1.Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Tarry M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) demonstrate that in forming the codon/anticodon duplex in the ribosomal A site, ribosomal nucleotides A1492 and A1493 flip out of the internal loop of ribosomal helix 44. In addition, the ribosomal nucleotide G530 switches from the syn-conformation toanti-conformation. In these new conformations, A1492 and A1493 interact with the first and second base pair in the minor groove of the codon/anticodon helix, and G530 interacts with the second position of the anticodon and the third position of the codon (1.Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Tarry M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Thus, the ribosome discriminates cognate from near-cognate and noncognate tRNA at two positions of the anticodon/codon duplex corresponding to the first and second positions of the codon base pairing with the third and second positions of the anticodon. The wobble position of tRNA (position 34) appears to be more suited to accommodate other geometries (1.Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Tarry M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Because the unmodified base sequences of some tRNA molecules do not bind their cognate codons in the ribosomal A site, we postulate that A1492 and A1493 are unable to interact with the minor groove of the codon/anticodon helix, and therefore, these tRNAs do not remain on the ribosome. Studies on the human tRNAUUULys3 (30.Benas P. Bec G. Keith G. Marquet R. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Dumas P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), human ASLUUULys3 (31.Stuart J.W. Gdaniec Z. Guenther R. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13396-13404Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and E. coli ASLUUULys (32.Sundaram M. Durant P.C. Davis D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12575-12584Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have shown that the modified nucleosides in the anticodon domain of tRNALysspecies with the UUU anticodon are necessary for the biochemical and structural characteristics of this molecule. The single incorporation of t6A37, 3′ adjacent to the anticodon triplet, inhibited base pairing across the anticodon loop (31.Stuart J.W. Gdaniec Z. Guenther R. Marszalek M. Sochacka E. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13396-13404Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the combination of t6A37 with mnm5s2U34 restored the characteristic U-turn in the anticodon, resulting in the canonical stacked anticodon triplet (30.Benas P. Bec G. Keith G. Marquet R. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Dumas P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32.Sundaram M. Durant P.C. Davis D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12575-12584Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Lim and Curran (12.Lim V.I. Curran J.F. RNA. 2001; 7: 942-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have proposed that the correct codon/anticodon duplexes are those whose formation and interaction with the ribosomal decoding center are not accompanied by uncompensated losses of hydrogen and ionic bonds. Therefore, to distinguish cognate from errant anticodon/codon duplexes, the ribosome must sterically restrict duplexes such that only cognate complexes form fully compensating bonds in the decoding center (12.Lim V.I. Curran J.F. RNA. 2001; 7: 942-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Modified nucleosides appear to be necessary for the sequences of some tRNAs to create an anticodon loop that enables A1492 and A1493 to interact with the minor groove of the codon/anticodon helix without uncompensated losses of hydrogen and ionic bonds. The modified nucleosides in the anticodon loop of some tRNAs modulate codon recognition in the ribosomal A and P sites. We have shown that the need for a modified U34 directly correlates to the need for the tRNA to discriminate at the third position of the codon. Lim and Curran (12.Lim V.I. Curran J.F. RNA. 2001; 7: 942-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have suggested that the requirement for modifications at position 34 may have arisen from evolutionary pressure to prevent errors in codon recognition (12.Lim V.I. Curran J.F. RNA. 2001; 7: 942-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Primitive codes may have specified fewer amino acids, and the mixed codon boxes may have originally specified single amino acids. Restricting wobble at tRNA position 34 would have functionally split some of the codon boxes, allowing the incorporation of more amino acids into protein sequences (12.Lim V.I. Curran J.F. RNA. 2001; 7: 942-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have also found some ASL sequences that have an unmodified G or C at position 34, and a modification at position 37 also appear to require modified nucleosides (data not shown). Position 37 modifications may be involved in preventing frame-shifting (13.Yokoyama S. Nishimura S. Soll D. RajBhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 207-223Google Scholar) and probably have arisen from an evolutionary pressure to maintain correct translation of the genetic code. Modified nucleosides in the anticodon domain of tRNAs appear to be a means of expanding the complexity of mRNA molecules that interact with this region of the tRNA. The diversity of modified nucleosides at positions 34 and 37 may create an anticodon triplet unique enough to be specifically identified by the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase while maintaining an anticodon loop structure that allows a ribosome-mediated anticodon/codon discrimination during protein synthesis.

A typical histological hallmark of AD is the extracellular deposition of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), which is produced by the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Most of the gene mutations that segregate with the inherited forms of AD result in increasing the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 production. Aβ42 also accumulates in neurons of AD patients. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the neuronal production of Aβ42 is a critical event in AD, but the intraneuronal Aβ42 toxicity has never been demonstrated. Here, we report that the long term expression of human APP in rat cortical neurons induces apoptosis. Although APP processing leads to production of extracellular Aβ1–40 and soluble APP, these extracellular derivatives do not induce neuronal death. On the contrary, neurons undergo apoptosis as soon as they accumulate intracellular Aβ1–42 following the expression of full-length APP or a C-terminal deleted APP isoform. The inhibition of intraneuronal Aβ1–42 production by a functional γ-secretase inhibitor increases neuronal survival.

AD is characterized by a massive neuronal loss in vulnerable brain regions (1Gomez-Isla T. Hollister R. West H. Mui S. Growdon J.H. Petersen R.C. Parisi J.E. Hyman B.T. Ann.

Two typical hallmarks of AD are neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques (3Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11423) Google Scholar). The major constituent of the amyloid core of senile plaques is the β-amyloid or Aβ peptide. The Aβ peptide is a 39–43-amino acid peptide produced from a larger precursor, the amyloid precursor protein or APP (4Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3930) Google Scholar). Among the ten identified isoforms of human APP (5Octave J.N. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 287-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), eight contain the Aβ sequence. The isoform that is mainly expressed in the human brain is a 695-amino acid protein known as APP695 (4Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G.

On the other hand, recent reports have demonstrated an intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ42 in AD-vulnerable brain regions (12Gouras G.K. Tsai J. Naslund J. Vincent B. Edgar M. Checler F.

Intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation has also been reported in transgenic mice expressing FAD proteins (14Wirths O. Multhaup G. Czech C. Blanchard V. Moussaoui S. Tremp G. Pradier L. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. Neurosci.

Altogether, these data support the idea that Aβ42 accumulation and neuronal loss are closely correlated. Nevertheless, the direct link between Aβ production by neurons and neuronal death has not been clearly established until now. Here, we report that the long term expression of human APP in rat-cultured neurons induces apoptosis. To understand how APP expression and processing modify neuronal survival, we characterized the extracellular and intracellular Aβ isoforms produced by the processing of different APP constructs. We further demonstrated that APP-induced neuronal apoptosis depends on intraneuronal Aβ1–42 accumulation.

The pAdRSVAPP695 vector was generated by subcloning the EcoRV-SalI fragment of pHMGAPP695 (22Czech C. Delaere P. Macq A.F. Reibaud M. Dreisler S. Touchet N. Schombert B. Mazadier M. Mercken L.

Makeh I. Perricaudet M. Briand P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The deletion of the APP 695 intracellular domain was generated by PCR amplification of the APP 695 sequence using a 5′ primer (5′-AACGAAGTTGAGCCTGTTGATG-3′) encoding residues 560–567 of APP 695 and containing a BglII restriction site and a 3′ primer (5′-GTCGACCTAGTACTGTTTCTTCTTCAGC-3′) complementary to the sequence encoding residues 648–653 followed by a stop codon and a SalI restriction site. pAdRSVAPPΔC was generated by insertion of the BglII-SalI-digested PCR product in the BglII-SalI sites of pAdRSVAPP695. Production, propagation, and purification of adenoviruses (AdRSVAPP, AdRSVAPPΔC, and AdRSVβ-gal) were performed as described previously (20Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Makeh I. Perricaudet M. Briand P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). After 6 days in vitro, neuronal cultures were infected at the multiplicity of infection of 100 for 4 h in a minimal volume of culture medium. Infection medium was then replaced by fresh culture medium for 3–5 days. Under these conditions, at least 75% of neurons express the proteins encoded by recombinant adenoviruses (16Macq A.F. Czech C.

Neuronal survival was measured by the colorimetric MTT assay as described previously (23Kienlen-Campard P. Crochemore C. Rene F. Monnier D. Koch B. Loeffler J.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Neurons grown in 96-well culture dishes were incubated after infection for 2 h at 37 °C in fresh culture medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT. Medium was removed, and dark blue crystals formed were dissolved by adding 100 μl/well of lysis solution (isopropyl alcohol/0.04 n HCl). Outer diameter was measured on a microplate reader (492 nm). For nuclear staining, cells were fixed (0.37% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated for 30 min in the Hoechst 33342 dye (1 μg/ml). Nuclear morphology was analyzed under fluorescence microscopy at excitation/emission wavelengths of 350/450 nm. Cell culture medium and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot as described previously (16Macq A.F. Czech C. Essalmani R. Brion J.P. Maron A. Mercken L. Pradier L. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28931-28936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (20 μg of protein) and culture medium (15 μl) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, incubated overnight at 4 °C with human APP-specific primary WO2 antibody at 1 μg/ml (24Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol.

Aβ production was monitored by immunoprecipitation of cell culture medium. The quantification of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 isoforms was performed by ELISA. Culture medium was collected, treated with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and cleared by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). One hundred μl of the supernatant was used for Aβ quantification by fluorescent sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Previous experiments showed that there is no cross-reaction between Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 recognition. Fluorescence emission was measured at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485 nm/535 nm. Immunoprecipitation was performed on 1.5 ml of the remaining culture medium with 15 μl/ml anti-Aβ whole rabbit serum (16Macq A.F. Czech C. Essalmani R. Brion J.P. Maron A. Mercken L. Pradier L. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28931-28936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blot on a 4–12% Nupage™ gel using the WO2 antibody. Aβ was extracted from cell lysates by a modification of the protocol described previously (25Skovronsky D.M. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Neurons (∼107 cells) were scraped and pelleted in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were solubilized in 300 μl of formic acid (70%). Formic acid-solubilized cell pellets were cleared (16,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) to remove cell debris, and supernatants were centrifuged at 21,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatants were vacuum-dried, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of alkaline carbonate buffer (2% Na2CO3, 0.1 n NaOH) and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C). Protein concentration was measured on 50 μl of the resulting supernatant by using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, 800 μl of the supernatant was neutralized with 800 μl of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and diluted 1:3 in H2O. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. For ELISA, 100 μl of the remaining supernatant was neutralized with 100 μl of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and diluted 1:3 in H2O containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (final concentrations). Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 concentrations were measured by ELISA on 100 μl of neutralized extract. The number of samples (n) in each experimental condition is indicated in the figure legends. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-test. When rat cortical neurons are infected by AdRSVAPP or AdRSVβ-gal, a maximal and stable production of APP and β-gal is observed at day 3 postinfection (16Macq A.F. Czech C. Essalmani R. Brion J.P. Maron A. Mercken L. Pradier L. Octave J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28931-28936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). APP expression and processing have been analyzed by using the human-specific WO2 antibody (24Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Five days after infection by AdRSVAPP, high levels of soluble human APP (sαAPP) and Aβ are detected in the culture medium (Fig.1A). This indicates that human APP is efficiently processed through both non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways in rat neurons. The extracellular Aβ was quantified in the culture medium of neurons expressing human APP (Fig.1B). These neurons secrete about 100 pg/ml of Aβ 1–40, but there is no detectable extracellular Aβ1–42 (not shown). In the same experimental conditions, the MTT survival assay shows that human APP expression induces neuronal death, whereas β-gal expression has no effect (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that a 5-day expression and processing of human APP in rat cortical neurons exert strong neurotoxic effects. To further study the mechanism of the neuronal death triggered by human APP expression, neurons were stained with the Hoechst 3342 nuclear dye. This morphological analysis of the nuclei allows us to discriminate between the surviving and the apoptotic cells that display high nuclear condensation or fragmentation (26Edwards S.N. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Nuclear morphology of neurons was analyzed 5 days after infection by AdRSVβ-gal or AdRSVAPP (Fig. 1D), and the results were quantified to compare the proportion of apoptotic neurons in each condition (Fig. 1E). There is a 2-fold increase of apoptotic nuclei in neurons expressing APP as compared with the non-infected or β-gal-expressing neurons. This establishes that a 5-day expression of human APP induces apoptosis in rat-cultured neurons. We next analyzed whether the extracellular secretion of APP and Aβ could be responsible for the neurotoxic effects observed. To that end, neurons were incubated in the culture medium of a transfected CHO cell line or neuronal cultures expressing human APP695. The analysis of these two conditioned media indicates that they contain similar amounts of sαAPP but different amounts of Aβ (Fig.2A). The quantification of Aβ shows that the CHO-conditioned medium contains almost 100-fold more Aβ1–40 than the neuronal-conditioned medium. In addition, Aβ1–42 is present in the CHO culture medium, whereas it is undetectable in the neuronal culture medium (Fig. 2B). The treatment of neurons with these conditioned media does not significantly modify neuronal survival (Fig. 2C). Altogether, these results demonstrate that, in our model, the neuronal apoptosis induced by human APP is not triggered by any APP derivative, including Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, secreted in the culture medium. This raises the hypothesis that intracellular APP derivatives could be responsible for its neurotoxic effects. A possible origin of APP-induced neuronal death could be related to the intracellular C-terminal domain of the protein, which has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in other cellular models (27Lu D.C. Rabizadeh S. Chandra S. Shayya R.F. Ye L.M. Ellerby X. Salvesen G.S. Koo E.H. Bredesen D.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 28Yamatsuji T. Matsui T. Okamoto T. Komatsuzaki K. Takeda S. Fukumoto H. Iwatsubo T. Suzuki N. Asami-Odaka A. Ireland S. Kinane T.B. Giambarella U. Nishimoto I. Science. 1996; 272: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, neurons were infected with a recombinant adenovirus (AdRSVAPPΔC) encoding a human APP isoform deleted in the intracellular C terminus of the protein. Five days after infection by AdRSVAPPΔC, sαAPP and Aβ were detected in the neuronal culture medium (Fig.3A). Neurons expressing human APPΔC secrete about 50 pg/ml of Aβ 1–40 (Fig. 3B). This corresponds to half of the concentration of extracellular Aβ produced following the expression of full-length APP (Fig. 1B). In the same experimental conditions, the MTT survival assay shows that human APPΔC expression induces neuronal death (Fig. 3C). Hoechst staining indicates that APPΔC, like APP, triggers neuronal apoptosis (not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the intracellular C-terminal domain of human APP is not involved in the neuronal death observed. Since the neurotoxic effect of APP does not involve the intracellular domain of the protein, we investigated whether the accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ could trigger apoptosis. An important fraction of intracellular Aβ has been shown to be insoluble (29Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30Yang A.J. Chandswangbhuvana D. Shu T. Henschen A. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20650-20656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, cells were solubilized in 70% formic acid as described previously (25Skovronsky D.M. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) to recover all the intraneuronal Aβ peptide. The analysis of formic acid-solubilized cell pellets after 3 days of infection by AdRSVAPP or AdRSVAPPΔC reveals a similar expression pattern of the intraneuronal human proteins, although APPΔC is detected in lower amounts as compared with APP (Fig.4A). In the same experimental conditions, immunoprecipitation of cellular extracts show that intraneuronal Aβ is undetectable (Fig. 4A). The survival assay shows that, after 3 days of infection, neither APP nor APPΔC expression causes neurotoxic effects (Fig. 4C), indicating that the overexpression of different levels of APP or APPΔC per se does not induce any neurotoxicity. After 5 days of infection, neurons still express different amounts of APP or APPΔC, but they accumulate similar amounts of intraneuronal Aβ 1–42. (Fig.4B) In all these experiments, intraneuronal Aβ1–40 was not detectable (not shown). After 5 days, both APP and APPΔC induce a massive neuronal death, as compared with non-infected or β-gal-expressing neurons (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results clearly establish that, in our model, APP-induced neuronal death takes place only when intraneuronal Aβ1–42 is detected. To further demonstrate that intraneuronal Aβ1–42 accumulation leads to neuronal apoptosis, neurons expressing human APP were treated with DAPT, a functional γ-secretase inhibitor (19Dovey H.F. John V. Anderson J.P. Chen L.Z. de Saint A.P. Fang L.Y. Freedman S.B. Folmer B. Goldbach E. Hu E.J. Holsztynska K.L. Johnson-Wood K.L. Kennedy S.L. Kholodenko D. Knops J.E. Latimer L.H. Lee M.

In our experimental conditions, DAPT does not display significant neurotoxicity by itself (not shown). Although DAPT treatment does not modify the secretion of sαAPP in the culture medium, it reduces the extracellular Aβ1−40 concentration to a non-detectable level (Fig.5A). DAPT also strongly reduces (57%) the production of intraneuronal Aβ1–42 without affecting the levels of APP expression (Fig. 5B). This reduction of intraneuronal Aβ1–42 production is concomitant with a significant recovery (52%) of cell survival (Fig. 5C). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the neuronal apoptosis induced by human APP in our model is triggered by the production and accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ1–42. It is currently well admitted that APP plays a central role in AD, but less is known about the link existing between APP processing and the massive neuronal death that takes place in the disease. In the present study, we report that long term expression of human APP triggers apoptosis in rat neurons. This neuronal apoptosis is not related to the adenoviral-mediated overexpression of an exogenous protein since the adenoviral-mediated expression of β-galactosidase is without effect on neuronal survival. Our results are in line with previous studies showing that the adenoviral expression of human APP695 induces apoptosis in both rat hippocampal neurons (31Uetsuki T. Takemoto K. Nishimura I. Okamoto M. Niinobe M. Momoi T. Miura M. Yoshikawa K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6955-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rat brain (32Nishimura I. Uetsuki T. Dani S.U. Ohsawa Y. Saito I. Okamura H. Uchiyama Y. Yoshikawa K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2387-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus very important to understand how human APP could induce neuronal death. We first investigated the role of secreted Aβ in APP-induced neurotoxicity. We utilized the culture medium of a CHO cell line or neurons expressing different levels of human APP as a source of extracellular Aβ. The concentrations of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 in the CHO culture medium are comparable with those measured in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients (24Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). These concentrations of extracellular Aβ do not induce any neurotoxicity, indicating that extracellular soluble Aβ peptides are not directly responsible for neurodegeneration. It has been demonstrated previously that extracellular Aβ must aggregate into fibrils to acquire neurotoxic properties (11Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At micromolar concentrations, fibrillar Aβ provokes oxidative injuries followed by cell death in neuronal and glial cells (33Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 34Xu J. Chen S. Ahmed S.H. Ku H. Chen G. Goldberg M.P. Hsu C.Y. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This extracellular Aβ toxicity could be mediated by the interaction of fibrillar Aβ with APP present at the neuronal membrane (35Lorenzo A. Yuan M. Zhang Z. Paganetti P.A. Sturchler-Pierrat C. Staufenbiel M. Mautino J. Vigo F.S. Sommer B. Yankner B.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In the present study, even when neurons express human APP at their cell surface, the extracellular Aβ produced fails to induce neuronal death. The fact that APP-induced apoptosis occurs independently of secreted APP derivatives led us to investigate the role of the C-terminal domain of the protein in neuronal death. The APP C terminus is essential for the cell surface APP signaling function (36Neve R.L. McPhie D.L. Chen Y. Brain Res. 2000; 886: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and for the APP-dependent axonal anterograde transport (37Gunawardena S. Goldstein L.S. Neuron. 2001; 32: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 38Kamal A. Almenar-Queralt A. LeBlanc J.F. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Here we show that the neuronal expression of either C-terminal deleted APP (APPΔC) or full-length APP (APP695) induces apoptosis. In other cellular models, the C-terminal domain of APP has been shown to mediate cytotoxic effects. The cleavage of the intracellular domain of APP by caspases generates a C31 cytotoxic fragment in mouse N2a neuroblastoma cell lines (27Lu D.C. Rabizadeh S. Chandra S. Shayya R.F. Ye L.M. Ellerby X. Salvesen G.S. Koo E.H. Bredesen D.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The interaction of the intracellular domain of the V642I APP mutant with G proteins leads to nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in F11 neuronal cell lines (28Yamatsuji T. Matsui T. Okamoto T. Komatsuzaki K. Takeda S. Fukumoto H. Iwatsubo T. Suzuki N. Asami-Odaka A. Ireland S. Kinane T.B. Giambarella U. Nishimoto I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4205-4208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Since the neuronal apoptosis observed in this study is not mediated by the C-terminal domain of APP, we conclude that important differences in the metabolism and function of APP may exist between neuronal primary cultures and cell lines. Another possible origin of APP-induced apoptosis is the intracellular accumulation of Aβ. Neurons have been shown previously to produce intracellular Aβ42 (25Skovronsky D.M. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 40Hartmann T. Bieger S.C. Bruhl B. Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Unsicker K. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Here we report that neurons expressing human APP or APPΔC accumulate very similar amounts of intraneuronal Aβ1–42, whereas they produce different amounts of extracellular Aβ1–40. The extracellular Aβ production by neurons expressing APP or APPΔC is in agreement with previous observations in transfected cells (18Essalmani R. Macq A.F. Mercken L. Octave J.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 41Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 3 days of infection, the expression of membrane human APP or APPΔC at different levels does not induce any neurotoxicity, indicating that the overexpression of APP per se is not toxic. In addition, the amount of intraneuronal Aβ1–42 is probably too low to be detected, and there is no neuronal damage observed. After 5 days of infection, the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ1–42 in neurons expressing APP or APPΔC provokes a massive neuronal apoptosis. To further demonstrate that intraneuronal Aβ1–42 accumulation induces neuronal apoptosis, the intraneuronal production of Aβ1–42 was inhibited by a functional γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT (19Dovey H.F. John V. Anderson J.P. Chen L.Z. de Saint A.P. Fang L.Y. Freedman S.B. Folmer B. Goldbach E. Hu E.J. Holsztynska K.L. Johnson-Wood K.L. Kennedy S.L. Kholodenko D. Knops J.E. Latimer L.H. Lee M. Liao Z. Lieberburg I.M. Motter R.N. Mutter L.C. Nietz J. Quinn K.P. Sacchi K.L. Seubert P.A. Shopp G.M. Thorsett E.D. Wu J.S. Tung J. Yang S. Yin C.T. Schenk D.B. May P.C. Altstiel L.D. Bender M.H. Boggs L.N. Britton T.C. Clemens J.C. Czilli D.L. Dieckman-McGinty D.K. Droste J.J. Fuson K.S. Gitter B.D. Hyslop P.A. Li E.M. Johnstone W.Y. Little S.P. Mabry T.E. Ni F.D. Miller B. Nissen J.S.

DAPT was chosen among other functional γ-secretase inhibitors described (40Hartmann T. Bieger S.C. Bruhl B. Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Unsicker K. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) because it was the only one that was not neurotoxic by itself in our experimental conditions. Moreover, DAPT specifically inhibits Aβ production without affecting APP expression and processing through the non-amyloidogenic pathway. DAPT was able to reduce extracellular Aβ1–40 production to a non-detectable level and inhibited intraneuronal Aβ1–42 production by 57%. The differential inhibition observed at Aβ40 and Aβ42 sites could be viewed as evidence that different γ-secretases generate Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 or could result from the production of these two peptides in different cellular organelles to which γ-secretase inhibitors have access with different efficiency (42Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11914-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The production of intraneuronal APP and Aβ was studied in three different experimental conditions: (i) production of APP without detectable Aβ1–42, (ii) production of APP and Aβ1–42, (iii) production of APP and partial inhibition of the production of Aβ1–42. Our results show that the DAPT-mediated inhibition of intraneuronal Aβ1–42 accumulation (57%) is similar to the DAPT-mediated recovery of neuronal survival (52%). This clearly indicates that the neuronal apoptosis that we observed results from the accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ1–42. The mechanisms by which intraneuronal Aβ accumulation triggers apoptosis are currently unknown. The highly amyloidogenic Aβ1–42 is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum/intermediate compartment of neuronal cells (43Cook D.G. Forman M.S. Sung J.C. Leight S. Kolson D.L. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1021-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The intracellular accumulation of Aβ1–42 may cause an overload of the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to neuronal cell injury (44Paschen W. Frandsen A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Intraneuronal Aβ accumulation has been described in transgenic mice expressing FAD mutations. In double transgenic mice expressing human PS1 and APP mutants, intraneuronal Aβ accumulation precedes amyloid deposition (14Wirths O. Multhaup G. Czech C. Blanchard V. Moussaoui S. Tremp G. Pradier L. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 306: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation together with extensive neuronal loss occurs without amyloid deposition in transgenic mice expressing a human PS1 mutation (15Chui D.H. Tanahashi H. Ozawa K. Ikeda S.

Neuronal loss has also been documented in transgenic mice expressing the Swedish APP mutation that leads to plaque formation (45Calhoun M.E. Wiederhold K.H. Abramowski D. Phinney A.L. Probst A.

Intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ42 in AD brains has been recently reported (12Gouras G.K. Tsai J. Naslund J. Vincent B. Edgar M. Checler F. Greenfield J.P. Haroutunian V. Xu J.D. Buxbaum H.

Although AD patients show a severe neuronal loss in specific brain regions, the involvement of apoptosis in AD neurodegeneration remains a matter of debate (46Cotman C.W. Su J.H. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Apoptotic features have been observed in brains of AD patients (47Su J.H. Anderson A.J. Cummings B.J. Cotman C.W. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 2529-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), but it may be very difficult to observe the transient apoptotic state of neurons when looking at the lesions several years after the onset of the disease. In conclusion, our data, in agreement with other recent reports, strongly support the idea that the intraneuronal production and accumulation of Aβ1–42 are key events in AD. Elucidating how intraneuronal Aβ triggers apoptosis should in turn allow a better understanding of the neurodegeneration occurring in the disease. We thank K. Beyreuther and L. Mercken for the generous gift of the WO2 antibody and DAPT, respectively. Also, we acknowledge A. S. Caumont for the critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2029577022,"Genetic studies in Drosophila melanogaster underscore the importance of the insulin-signalling pathway in controlling cell, organ and animal size. Effectors of this pathway include Chico (the insulin receptor substrate homologue), dPI(3)K, dPKB, dPTEN, and dS6K. Mutations in any of these components have a striking effect on cell size and number, with the exception of dS6K. Mutants in dS6K affect cell size but not cell number, seemingly consistent with arguments that dS6K is a distal effector in the signalling pathway, directly controlled by dTOR, a downstream effector of dPI(3)K and dPKB. Unexpectedly, recent studies showed that dS6K activity is unimpaired in chico-deficient larvae, suggesting that dS6K activation may be mediated through the dPI(3)K docking sites of the Drosophila insulin receptor. Here, we show genetically, pharmacologically and biochemically that dS6K resides on an insulin signalling pathway distinct from that of dPKB, and surprisingly also from that of dPI(3)K. More striking, despite dPKB-dPI(3)K-independence, dS6K activity is dependent on the Drosophila homologue of the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, dPDK1, demonstrating that both dPDK1, as well as dTOR, mediated dS6K activation is phosphatidylinositide-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-independent."
https://openalex.org/W2096264533,"Ca(v)2.1 channels, which mediate P/Q-type Ca2+ currents, undergo Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent inactivation and facilitation that can significantly alter synaptic efficacy. Here we report that the neuronal Ca2+-binding protein 1 (CaBP1) modulates Ca(v)2.1 channels in a manner that is markedly different from modulation by CaM. CaBP1 enhances inactivation, causes a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation, and does not support Ca2+-dependent facilitation of Ca(v)2.1 channels. These inhibitory effects of CaBP1 do not require Ca2+, but depend on the CaM-binding domain in the alpha1 subunit of Ca(v)2.1 channels (alpha12.1). CaBP1 binds to the CaM-binding domain, co-immunoprecipitates with alpha12.1 from transfected cells and brain extracts, and colocalizes with alpha12.1 in discrete microdomains of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Our results identify an interaction between Ca2+ channels and CaBP1 that may regulate Ca2+-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity by inhibiting Ca2+ influx into neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2115504260,"Oligosaccharide moieties of glycoproteins are structurally altered during development, carcinogenesis, and malignant transformations. It is well known that β1–6 GlcNAc branching, a product of UDP-GlcNAc α-mannoside β1–6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-V), is associated with malignant transformation as the results of such alterations. However, the mechanism by which β1–6 GlcNAc branching is linked to metastasis remains unclear, because the identification of specific glycoprotein(s) that are glycosylated by GnT-V and its biological function have not been examined. We herein report that matriptase, which activates both urokinase-type plasminogen activator and hepatocyte growth factor, is a target protein for GnT-V. The overexpression of GnT-V in gastric cancer cells leads to severe peritoneal dissemination in athymic mice, which can be attributed to the increased expression of matriptase. This increase was due to the acquired resistance of matriptase to degradation, since it is glycosylated by GnT-V and a corresponding increase in the active form. These results indicate that this process is a key element in malignant transformation, as the direct result of oligosaccharide modification.

Oncogene. 1998; 22: 2087-2093Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of GnT-V revealed the functional binding sites of the Ets family. In addition, certain transcription factors belonging to the Ets family are activated by the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, which leads to cell proliferation and transformation (17.Galang C.K.

The Ras proto-oncogene sustains activating mutations in ∼20% of all human tumors. Ras signaling is induced by other common mutations, such as the amplification of Neu/ErbB-2 in breast cancer (18.Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L.

Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The author reported that GnT-V stimulated membrane ruffling and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B activation. However, functional changes in specific glycoproteins that contain β1–6 GlcNAc branching have not been described in terms of tumor metastasis, and the biological significance of GnT-V appears to be different for each type of cancer. A high level of expression of GnT-V in human colorectal and breast cancer is correlated with distant or lymph node metastasis with a poor prognosis (9.Fernandes B. Sagman U. Augar M. Demetriou M. Dennis J.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 718-723PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Seelentag W.K. Li W.P. Schmitz S.F. Metzger U. Aeberhard P. Heitz P.U. Roth J.

In contrast, the expression of GnT-V is an early event in hepatocarcinogenesis, and the level of GnT-V expression in hepatoma does not correlate with the prognosis of the patient after an operation (10.Miyoshi E.

In fact, hepatoma cells, which express high levels of GnT-V, such as Huh7 and HepG2 cells, showed no metastasis in studies using athymic mice. This discrepancy between colon cancer and hepatoma might be due to the target glycoproteins of GnT-V. Although structural analyses ofN-glycans on glycoprotein(s) that are glycosylated by GnT-V, such as integrins and LAMP-2 (lysosomalassociated membrane protein 2), have been carried out, our biological knowledge of these proteins' function by β1–6 GlcNAc branching is insufficient (6.Demetriou M.

In addition, we describe detailed biochemical analyses of this protease with reference to the significance of the extent of β1–6 GlcNAc branching. Human gastric cancer cell line MKN45 was obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resource (Tokyo, Japan). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nikken Kagaku, Kyoto, Japan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. A human GnT-V cDNA (8.Saito H. Nishikawa A. Gu J. Ihara Y.

Ito K. Ishida M. Takagi H. Nakamori S. Sano K. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 39: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and 5 μg of the GnT-V expression vector was transfected into MKN45 cells by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Selection was performed via the addition of 500 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Positive and negative clones (vector alone) were randomly selected. Two positive clones (GnT-V-1 and GnT-V-2) and one negative clone (mock) were used for the experiments that are described herein, but the results using other clones were very similar. Matriptase transfectants were established in a manner similar to that for GnT-V transfectants, using a pcDNA3.1/Neo vector (Invitrogen) containing the matriptase cDNA sequence. GnT-V activity was assayed as previously reported (26.Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, pyridylaminated biantennary sugar chain and 10–20 μg of sonicated cell lysates in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) incubated with 125 mm MES buffer (pH 6.25), 40 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 200 mmGlcNAc, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA in buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. Enzymatic products were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Protein concentrations were determined by a bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Total RNAs were prepared from MKN45 cells according to the method previously reported (27.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of RNAs were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde and transferred onto a Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane filter was prehybridized in a prehybridization buffer for 3 h at 42 °C and then hybridized with a [α−32P]CTP-labeled GnT-V cDNA fragment for 12 h at 42 °C in a hybridization buffer (10.Miyoshi E. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Gu J. Sugiyama T. Hayashi N. Fusamoto H. Kamada T. Taniguchi N. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3899-3902PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane filter was washed with 2× standard saline citrate, pH 7.4, and 0.1% SDS twice for 10 min each at 55 °C and then washed with 2× standard saline citrate, pH 7.4, and 0.1% SDS twice for 30 min. The filter was then exposed to an x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensified screen at −80 °C for 1 day. Lectin blot analysis was performed as described previously (28.Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cultures of mock and GnT-V transfectants were washed three times with PBS and incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 for 72 h. The resultant conditioned medium was concentrated 10-fold by Centricon-30. Twenty μl of concentrated conditioned medium from mock- and GnT-V-transfected MKN45 cells (GnT-V transfectants) were electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C, the filter was incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin, L4-PHA (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan), which preferentially recognizes β1–6 branches of tri- or tetra-antennary sugar chain (29.Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11230-11234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature. The washing and developing procedures have been described previously (28.Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To verify that the total proteins were equally loaded, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Animals were kept in the Institute of Experimental Animal Sciences Osaka University Medical School (IEXAS), and all experiments were performed according to the Osaka University Medical School Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. To evaluate the metastatic potential of GnT-V transfectants, we injected 1 × 106 mock and GnT-V transfectants into the peritoneum of the athymic nude mice (6-week-old female BALB/c mice; SLC, Shizuoka, Japan). Briefly, 1 day prior to the experiments, 5 × 106 cells were plated on a 10-cm dish in the standard medium. Cells were harvested by incubating 1 mm EDTA in the presence of PBS plus 0.25% trypsin (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at 37 °C for 3 min. After inactivation of trypsin by the addition of serum, the cells were washed with PBS and suspended to a single cell level with Hanks' buffer. 1 × 106 cells were injected into the peritoneum of the athymic nude mice. At 1 month after the injection, the mice were sacrificed under anesthesia. Tumor formation and metastasis in the lymph node and liver were macroscopically evaluated. These mice were maintained in the controlled room temperature at the Institute of Experimental Animal Science, Osaka University Medical School. Gelatin zymography was carried out as described previously with a slight modification (30.Shi Y.E. Torri J. Yieh L. Wellstein A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1409-1415PubMed Google Scholar). Gelatin (1 mg/ml) as the substrate was copolymerized with regular SDS-PAGE. Twenty μl of concentrated serum-free conditioned medium (the sample of lectin blot) was subjected to electrophoresis at a constant current of 15 mA. The gelatin gels were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C overnight. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To evaluate proteases that were secreted from MKN45 cells, various protease inhibitors were added to the gelatin substrate zymography. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was incubated with each protease inhibitor, such as BE16627B (kindly provided from Dr. Okuyama, Banyu Tsukuba Research Institute), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (31.Naito K. Nakajima S. Kanbayashi N. Okuyama A. Goto M. Agents Actions. 1993; 39: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), aprotinin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a serine protease inhibitor, and EDTA, a metal-dependent protease inhibitor. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, inhibitory activities of gelatin degradation were evaluated by the loss of the zone of degradation seen on zymography compared with that of the untreated samples. Twenty μl of a 10-fold concentrated condition medium from mock and GnT-V transfectants was electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with PBS containing 5% skim milk for 2 h at room temperature, the membrane filter was incubated with 1:2000 diluted anti-human matriptase, mAb 21-9 (32.Lin C.Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), for 2 h at room temperature. The filter was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 10 min each and then incubated with 1:2500 diluted peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) for 1 h. After the membrane had been washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, it was developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fifty μl of mAb 21-9 was incubated with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotating, followed by sedimentation of the agarose beads by low speed centrifugation. The beads were washed five times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. For immunodepletion of matriptase from GnT-V-transfected MKN45 cells, the conditioned medium was incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose CL-4B bound with mAb 21-9. The beads were pelleted by low speed centrifugation, and the supernatant was then concentrated 10-fold using a Centricon 30 concentrator (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The concentrated supernatants were used for gelatin zymography and immunoblot analysis of matriptase. Approximately 500 μg of total cellular proteins in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, and various protease inhibitors) and 30 μl of L4-PHA agarose (Seikagaku Corp.) were rotated for 3 h at 4 °C at low speed. After washing three times, the pellets were resuspended in loading buffer and were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE, with or without boiling for analysis by Western blot of matriptase. Cells in subconfluent and confluent conditions were removed from 10-cm culture dishes using PBS plus 0.2% EDTA. They were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min and were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. Cell suspensions (5–10 × 106 cells) were incubated with a primary antibody (mAb 21-9 diluted 1:100) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed three times with 1 ml of PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat immunoglobulins (Toyobo) diluted 1:50, and incubated for 30 min on ice. After washing three times, flow cytometry analyses were performed using a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) operating with CELLQuest software. Cells were suspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1% Triton X-100. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatants were used as cell lysates. Protein concentration was assayed by means of a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The cell lysates were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by Western blot using mAb 21-9. Mock and GnT-V transfectants of MKN45 cells in six-well tissue culture plates were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C with methionine- and cysteine-free medium containing 10% fetal calf serum dialyzed overnight. For pulse-chase studies, 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine were added at a concentration of 100 μCi/ml to the culture media, followed by incubation for 30 min for protein labeling. Cells were incubated for 0, 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 h in RPMI 1640 with 10% nondialyzed fetal calf serum. At the various incubation times, both conditioned media and cell lysates were collected. Immunoprecipitation and autoradiography procedures were performed as previously described (32.Lin C.Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular mechanisms of GnT-V in cancer metastasis through oligosaccharide modification, we used a gastric cancer MKN45 cell, because this cell line does not express detectable levels of GnT-V. We established two positive clones of MKN45 cells lines that express high levels of GnT-V (GnT-V transfectants) and one negative clone (mock transfectant). Levels of other glycosyltransferases, such asN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III and α1–6 fucosyltransferase were not affected by GnT-V gene transfection (Table I). Northern blot analysis showed a high expression of GnT-V mRNA in the GnT-V transfectants, which is consistent with the observed protein expression (Fig. 1, a and b), indicating that the high levels of GnT-V activity in MKN45-GnT-V-1 and - GnT-V-2 were due to the high transcriptional level.Table IEnzymatic activities of GnT-V, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT III), and α1–6 fucosyltransferase (α1–6 Fuc-T) in GnT-V gene-transfected MKN45 cellsCellsGnT-VGnT-IIIα1–6Fuc-Tpmol/h/mgParentNDND384 ± 8MockNDND398 ± 12MKN45-GnT-V-1592 ± 12ND409 ± 14MKN45-GnT-V-2891 ± 29ND374 ± 11Data represent mean ± S.D. of three experiments; ND, not detected.

To better understand the change in oligosaccharide structure in GnT-V transfectants, lectin blotting was performed using L4-PHA, which binds preferentially to GlcNAc residues on β1–6 branches of tri- or tetra-antennary sugar chains (29.Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11230-11234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secretory proteins from mock and GnT-V transfectants of MKN45 cells were highly reactive to L4-PHA in reducing conditions. Under reducing condition, numerous bands of 40–220 kDa in molecular mass were strongly stained with L4-PHA (Fig. 1 c, left panel). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed no changes in total secretary proteins from mock and GnT-V transfectants (Fig. 1 c, right panel). These results suggest that the overexpression of GnT-V in MKN45 cells leads to an increase in the frequency of β1–6 branches onN-glycans of their glycoproteins. To evaluate the metastatic potential of GnT-V transfectants, we investigated tumor formation in the various organs after injection into the peritoneum of athymic nude mice. A marked dissemination of metastatic cancer cells was observed in the GnT-V transfectants compared with parental cells or negative transfectants (mock). The incidence of tumor metastasis in liver and lymph nodes was significantly higher in the GnT-V transfectants than that in parent or mock cells. The expression of GnT-V mRNA in these metastatic lesions was dramatically increased (Fig. 2 b). All data relating to experimental metastasis are summarized in Table II. These results suggest that glycoprotein(s) containing β1–6 GlcNAc branching might be involved in cancer metastasis to visceral organs and lymph nodes.Table IITumor formation of GnT-V-transfected MKN45 cells in the liver and lymph node after injection into the peritoneum of athymic miceCellsLiverLymph nodeParent0/41/4Mock0/124/12 Clones 1 and 20/7, 0/52/7, 2/5MKN45-GnT-V8/132-ap < 0.005, compared with mock (clones 1 and 2) by x2 test.,2-bp < 0.05, compared with MKN45 matriptase (clones 1 and 2) by x2 test.13/132-ap < 0.005, compared with mock (clones 1 and 2) by x2 test.

Open table in a new tab To understand the mechanisms underlying the increases in the metastatic potential of GnT-V transfectants, the gelatinolytic activity in the conditioned medium of mock and GnT-V transfectants was assayed by gelatin zymography (Fig. 3). Gelatin zymography revealed an increase in the gelatinase activity of an ∼80-kDa protease in the GnT-V transfectants, which was not observed in the mock transfectants (Fig. 3 a). The intensity of this band of GnT-V transfectants was significantly higher than that of Mock-transfected MKN45 cells. To characterize this protease of 80 kDa, the gelatin gel was incubated with various types of protease inhibitors. The gelatinolytic activities of all proteases were eliminated by the addition of EDTA, an inhibitor of metal-dependent proteases (Fig. 3 b), suggesting that these proteases require metal ions in their activity. Matrix metalloproteinase-specific inhibitor BE16627B (31.Naito K. Nakajima S. Kanbayashi N. Okuyama A. Goto M. Agents Actions. 1993; 39: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) failed to inhibit the activity of the 80-kDa protease. However, the gelatinolytic activities of the ∼92- and 72-kDa proteins in the conditioned medium were completely inhibited by BE16627B (Fig. 3 c). These results strongly suggest that the 92- and 72-kDa proteases correspond to matrix metalloproteinase 9 and 2, respectively. Treatment with pepstatin, an inhibitor of aspartate protease, had no detectable effects on the gelatinolytic activities of the 80-kDa protease (data not shown). The proteolytic activity of the 80-kDa protease in the conditioned medium was completely blocked by aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor (Fig. 3 d). These results indicate that the 80-kDa protease is a metal-dependent serine protease. The results of gelatin zymography suggest that an 80-kDa protease from the GnT-V transfectants of MKN45 cells was a divalent cation-dependent serine protease. A search of the literature for such a protease indicated that it is very similar to a protease secreted from a human breast cancer cell, T47D (30.Shi Y.E. Torri J. Yieh L. Wellstein A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1409-1415PubMed Google Scholar). This protease was purified and identified as matriptase (21.Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol.

Matriptase is a type II, integral membrane, trypsin-like serine protease, which may be involved in tissue remodeling, cell growth, and cancer metastasis (23.Lee S.L. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. J. Biol.

Western blot analysis using the anti-matriptase antibody mAb 21-9 showed dramatic increases in both the cleaved 80-kDa (noncomplexed) and 95- and 110-kDa (complexed) forms of matriptase with fragments of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (32.Lin C.Y.

Potential insight into the coupling mechanism was provided by our previous finding that mutation to Lys of a single residue (Asp540) located in the S4-S5 linker endowed HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) K+ channels with the unusual ability to open in response to membrane depolarization and hyperpolarization in a voltage-dependent manner. We hypothesized that the unusual hyperpolarization-induced gating occurred through an interaction between Lys540 and the C-terminal end of the S6 domain, the region proposed to form the activation gate. Therefore, we mutated six residues located in this region of S6 (Ile662–Tyr667) to Ala in D540K HERG channels. Mutation of Arg665, but not the other five residues, prevented hyperpolarization-dependent reopening of D540K HERG channels. Mutation of Arg665 to Gln or Asp also prevented reopening. In addition, D540R and D540K/R665K HERG reopened in response to hyperpolarization. Together these findings suggest that a single residue (Arg665) in the S6 domain interacts with Lys540 by electrostatic repulsion to couple voltage sensing to hyperpolarization-dependent opening of D540K HERG K+ channels.

Similar to other voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels, HERG channels are closed at negative transmembrane potentials and open or inactivate in response to membrane depolarization.

Although the structural basis of the activation gate is not clear, substantial evidence implicates a critical role for the S6 α-helices (7Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M.

The equivalent domains of the KcsA channel (inner helices) line the channel pore and crisscross near the cytoplasmic side of the membrane to create a narrow aperture (7Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5745) Google Scholar). Narrowing or widening of the aperture is hypothesized to mediate channel closure or opening, respectively. Activation of KcsA channels by protons involves counterclockwise rotation of the inner helices, which presumably widens the diameter of the aperture to allow ion permeation (10Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis experiments have identified specific residues in the S6 domain of Shaker channels that are located on either side of the putative activation gate (8Liu Y.

Displacement of S4 could be transmitted to the activation gate via the concerted movement of domains S4-S6 or via specific interactions between more limited regions of the channel. For example, the intracellular S4-S5 linker may provide a direct link between the S4 domain and the activation gate (9Yellen G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 11Durell S.R. Hao Y. Guy H.R. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 263-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Voltage-dependent modification of the S4-S5 linker by thiol-reactive reagents suggests that conformational changes in the linker are coupled to movement of the S4 domain (12Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mutations in the S4-S5 linker influence the activation gating properties of Kv2.1 and Kv3.1 channels (13Shieh C.-C. Klemic K.G. Kirsch G.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Finally, a point mutation located in the S4-S5 linker (D540K) fundamentally alters the gating properties of HERG channels (14Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). D540K HERG channels have the unique ability to open in response to membrane hyperpolarization while retaining the ability to activate and inactivate in response to membrane depolarization. Although these studies suggest an important role for the S4-S5 linker in channel gating, specific interactions between the linker and the activation gate have not been demonstrated. The unique gating properties of D540K HERG provide the opportunity to characterize specific interactions that mediate coupling between voltage sensing and channel activation. We hypothesized that the closed state of D540K HERG channels is destabilized by the interaction of Lys540 with a specific amino acid(s) of the S6 domain. In this study we focused our attention on the C-terminal region of S6 because of the proposed role of the homologous region in KcsA channel activation. Six adjacent residues in S6 of D540K HERG were individually mutated to Ala, and the ability of the channels to open in response to membrane hyperpolarization was assessed. This approach identified a single residue (Arg665) that interacted with Lys540 to permit hyperpolarization-induced channel opening. Further mutagenesis suggested that the mechanism of this unique gating was electrostatic repulsion between basic residues at positions 540 and 665. Mutations were introduced into wild-type (WT) HERG using site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (15Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Before use in expression experiments, the constructs were characterized by restriction mapping and DNA sequence analyses. cRNA for injection into oocytes was prepared with SP6 Capscribe (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following linearization with EcoRI. Xenopus laevis frogs were anesthetized by immersion in 0.2% tricaine for 15 min. Ovarian lobes were digested with 2 mg/ml Type 1A collagenase (Sigma) in Ca2+-free ND96 solution for 1.5 h to remove follicle cells. Stage IV and V oocytes were injected with WT or mutant HERG cRNA (5–15 ng) and then cultured in Barth's solution supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin and 1 mm pyruvate at 18 °C. Barth's solution contained (in mm): 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 0.4 CaCl2, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 1 MgSO4, 2.4 NaHCO3, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). The two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique (16Stuhmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) was used to record membrane currents in oocytes 1–3 days after cRNA injection. To attenuate endogenous chloride currents, Cl− was replaced with MES in the external solution containing (in mm) 96 NaMES, 2 KMES, 2 CaMES2, 5 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.6 with methanesulfonic acid. Currents were recorded at room temperature (21–23 °C). Glass microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl, and their tips were broken to obtain tip resistances of 0.8–1.5 megaohms. Oocytes were voltage-clamped with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Voltage commands were generated using pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments), a personal computer, and a DigiData 1200 series interface (Axon Instruments). The oocyte membrane potential was held at −80 mV between test pulses, unless noted otherwise. The isochronal voltage dependence of activation of the hyperpolarization-induced open state (Oh) and the normal depolarization-induced open state (O) of D540K HERG channels were determined from tail currents measured at −70 mV following 2-s hyperpolarizing or depolarizing voltage steps, respectively. Tail current amplitude (It) was determined by fitting the decaying portion of tail currents to a bi-exponential function and extrapolating to the beginning of the repolarizing step. It was plotted versus test potential (Vt) and fitted to the sum of two Boltzmann distributions using ORIGIN software (Northampton, MA). I=ImaxOh/(1+exp[(Vt−V1/2Oh)/kOh])+Equation 1 ImaxO/(1+exp[(V1/2O−Vt)/kO]) V1/2 Oh and V1/2 O are the voltages at which the Oh and O state currents are half-activated. kOh and kO are the slope factors for the biphasic activation curve.Imax Oh and Imax O are the maximum Oh and O state tail current values. For this analysis we assume that the relative probability for the Oh and O state approaches zero at extreme voltages. For WT HERG (no Oh state) the first half of Equation 1 was set to zero. The time course of deactivation was obtained by fitting decaying tail currents to a bi-exponential function. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. (n = number of oocytes). The properties of WT and D540K HERG have been described previously (1Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Briefly, WT HERG current activated very slowly in response to weak depolarizations (e.g. −20 mV), whereas the activation rate was relatively fast at stronger depolarizations (e.g. +20 mV) (Fig. 1 A, left panel). Fast inactivation predominated at depolarized potentials, resulting in a decrease in steady state current magnitude at potentials positive to −10 mV (Fig. 1 B). Membrane hyperpolarization to potentials negative to −90 mV failed to induce inward current (Fig. 1, A and B). Repolarization to −70 mV after a depolarizing test pulse induced a tail current with a rapid rising phase followed by a slow decay, as channels that were inactivated during the test pulse rapidly recovered from inactivation and then slowly deactivated (Fig. 1 A, left panel). As reported previously (14Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), D540K HERG current activated nearly instantaneously upon depolarization from a holding potential of −80 mV. Hyperpolarization to potentials negative to −90 mV induced a slowly activating current that attained a steady state amplitude in 2 s (Fig. 1 A, right panel). The resulting current-voltage (I-V) relationship showed that inward current magnitude was much greater than outward current for equivalent electrochemical driving forces (Fig. 1 B). Repolarization to −70 mV after a hyperpolarizing test pulse (e.g. −160 mV) induced a tail current whose magnitude was larger and decay slower than tail currents induced after depolarizing test pulses (Fig. 1 A, inset). Tail currents after depolarizing test pulses (e.g. +40 mV) initially increased as channels recovered from inactivation and then decayed as channels deactivated into the closed state (Fig. 1 A, inset). The voltage dependence for activation of the Oh and O states for D540K HERG was determined by plotting peak tail current at −70 mV versus test potential and fitting the relationship to the sum of two Boltzmann functions. The normalized voltage dependence of the D540K channel opening had an inverted bell-shaped relationship (Fig. 1 C). The V1/2 values for O and Oh state activation were −15.5 ± 2.5 and −109.8 ± 1.8 mV, respectively. Therefore, the voltage dependence of depolarization- and hyperpolarization-induced channel opening was sufficiently separated to result in a voltage range near −60 mV where most channels were in a closed state. We tested the hypothesis that the Oh state is dependent upon interactions between Lys540 and a specific residue(s) in the C-terminal region of S6. Amino acids 662–667 (Fig. 2) of D540K HERG were individually mutated to Ala, and the resulting double mutant channel function was assayed using the voltage pulse protocol illustrated in Fig. 1 A. An amino acid mutation that prevented hyperpolarization-induced channel activation was considered a candidate residue for direct interaction with Lys540. The double mutant channels could be classified into three distinct groups based upon the relative magnitudes of inward and outward currents and the rate of deactivation from the Oh state. Group 1, comprising D540K/I663A, D540K/Q664A, and D540K/Y667A HERG channels, were most similar to D540K HERG. These mutant channels were characterized by large inward currents activated by hyperpolarization and extremely fast activation of outward current (Fig. 3, A–C). Unlike D540K HERG channels, Group 1 mutant channels exhibited a relatively large instantaneous current relative to the time-dependent component of inward current in response to hyperpolarization. In addition, deactivation of channels from the Oh state was slower than D540K HERG (Fig. 4). Group 2, consisting of D540K/I662A and D540K/L666A HERG channels, had relatively small hyperpolarization-activated inward currents compared with depolarization-activated outward currents (Fig. 3, D and E). Furthermore, deactivation of current after hyperpolarizing pulses was fast compared with deactivation after depolarizing pulses, and this rate was faster than D540K HERG channels (Fig. 4). In contrast to Groups 1 and 2, D540K/R665A HERG channels did not open in response to hyperpolarizing pulses as negative as −160 mV (Fig. 3 F). The gating kinetics of D540K/R665A HERG channels were also different from the other double mutant channels. The rates of current activation and deactivation were much slower (Fig. 3 F).Figure 4Time constants for Oh state current deactivation at −70 mV following a pulse to −140 mV (n = 4–10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The voltage dependence of channel activation was determined by plotting the relative amplitude of tail currents at −70 mV as a function of test potential. The currents were normalized to the largest tail current amplitude. For Group 1 channels, currents were normalized to the tail current measured after a pulse to −160 mV (Fig. 5 A). For Group 2 and D540K/R665A HERG, currents were normalized to the tail current measured after a depolarizing pulse (Fig. 5 B). The voltage dependence of channel activation was fit with the sum of two Boltzmann functions, one describing the hyperpolarization-dependent channel opening and another describing the depolarization-dependent channel opening. The V1/2 for Oh state activation varied between −65 and −112 mV, and the slope factor varied between 9 and 31 mV for the different double mutant channels, compared with a V1/2 of −110 mV and a slope factor of 9 mV for D540K (Table I). The V1/2 for O state activation varied between −11 and −37 mV with a slope factor between 12 and 22 mV for the different double mutant channels, compared with −16 mV and 12 mV for D540K (Table I). The O state activation parameters of D540K/I663A HERG channels could not be accurately determined because the relative amplitude of tail currents was too small. D540K/R665A HERG channels did not reopen with hyperpolarization. Unlike the other mutants, the voltage dependence of O state activation for D540K/R665A HERG was best described by the sum of two Boltzmann functions (Table I).Table IVoltage dependence of Oh and O current activationChannelOh activationO activationnV1/2kV1/2kmVmVWT HERGN/AN/A−11.4 ± 0.79.0 ± 0.48 D540K−109.8 ± 1.811.7 ± 0.9−15.5 ± 2.512.4 ± 0.47 D540R−96.0 ± 1.012.7 ± 1.2−7.6 ± 2.715.0 ± 1.38D540K/I663A−95 ± 213.1 ± 1.3N.D.N.D.7D540K/Q664A−104.6 ± 2.514.9 ± 1.9−30.7 ± 3.114.6 ± 0.74D540K/Y667A−86.9 ± 3.925.5 ± 1.4−26.5 ± 2.012.4 ± 1.38D540K/I662A−65.0 ± 4.731.0 ± 2.5−36.7 ± 3.022.3 ± 1.14D540K/L666A−108 ± 1.29.6 ± 0.3−10.6 ± 1.516.2 ± 0.510D540K/R665AN/AN/A−57.4 ± 0.67.4 ± 0.54−15.5 ± 4.49.7 ± 1.0The voltage dependence of Oh and O current activation was determined by plotting peak tail current amplitude at −70 mV versus test potential and fitting the data to the sum of two Boltzmann functions.

In summary, mutation of Arg665 to Ala, but not the other five residues in the scanned region of the S6 domain, rescued WT channel function by preventing the hyperpolarization-dependent reopening of D540K HERG channels. Although D540K-I662A and D540K-L666A HERG channels reopened with membrane hyperpolarization, the relative magnitude of inward current was small and deactivation from the Oh state was rapid compared with D540K HERG, consistent with destabilization of the Oh state. These findings demonstrate that specific residues in S6 can influence the stability of the D540K HERG channel Oh state and identify a critical role for Arg665 in hyperpolarization-dependent channel gating. To further investigate the role of the amino acid at position 665 in mediating hyperpolarization-induced reopening of D540K HERG channels, we mutated Arg665 to an acidic residue (Asp), a polar residue (Gln), and a basic residue (Lys). Neither D540K-R665D nor D540K-R665Q channels reopened with hyperpolarizing pulses (Fig. 6, A, B, and E). In contrast, substitution of Arg665 with another basic residue, Lys, induced channels to reopen in response to hyperpolarization (Fig. 6 C). The biophysical properties of D540K-R665K HERG channels were similar to D540K HERG channels, with the exceptions that depolarization-induced activation was shifted by −18 mV and the slope of the Oh activation curve was less steep (Table I). To confirm the importance of a basic residue at position 540, we substituted another basic residue, Arg, at this position in WT HERG. Like D540K HERG, D540R HERG channels also reopened in a time- and voltage-dependent manner with membrane hyperpolarization (Fig. 6 D). The V1/2 for the Oh and O state activation curves for D540R were shifted by about +10 mV compared with D540K HERG (Table I). These findings underscore the requirement for basic residues at position 665 in S6 and position 540 in the S4-S5 linker to permit hyperpolarization-induced channel opening and suggest that electrostatic repulsion might mediate this unusual gating. If an electrostatic interaction between residues 540 and 665 was the sole mechanism of hyperpolarization-induced channel opening, then substitution of Arg665 with an acidic residue in WT HERG (D540) might also produce a channel with properties similar to D540K HERG. We therefore substituted Glu or Asp for Arg at position 665 in WT HERG. R665E HERG channels did not functionally express. R665D HERG channels expressed but did not reopen with membrane hyperpolarization, even when cells were pulsed to −200 mV (data not shown). The R665D mutation did, however, affect the gating properties in that the transition from the depolarized O state to the closed state was markedly slow compared with WT HERG (Fig. 7). To further characterize the role of Arg665 in WT HERG channel gating, we studied the effects of substitution of Arg665with the hydrophobic residue Ala or the polar residue Gln. R665A, and to a lesser extent R665Q, HERG channels deactivated more slowly than WT HERG (Fig. 7). Mutations at position 665 also shifted the voltage dependence of O state activation to more hyperpolarized potentials compared with WT or D540K HERG (R665D,V1/2 = −35.6 ± 1.4 mV, k = 10.6 ± 0.6 mV; R665A, V1/2 = −30.9 ± 0.6 mV, k = 6.5 ± 0.1 mV; and R665Q HERG,V1/2 = −19.4 ± 1.2 mV, k = 7.1 ± 0.3 mV). Taken together, these data indicate that mutation of Arg665 slows deactivation, providing further evidence for the critical role of this residue in HERG channel gating. Despite recent advances in the understanding of the structural basis of the voltage sensor and the activation gate, little is known about how voltage sensing is coupled to channel opening. Potassium channel activation likely involves rotation of the S4 (17Cha A. Snyder G.E. Selvin P.R. Bezanilla F. Nature. 1999; 402: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 18Glauner K.S. Mannuzzu L.M. Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Nature. 1999; 402: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and S6 (10Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) domains. S6 rotation presumably opens the channel by increasing the diameter of the aperture formed by crisscrossing of the S6 domains (10Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 19Liu Y.S. Sompornpisut P. Perozo E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The coupling between voltage sensing and channel opening could be mediated via a concerted movement of the S4-S6 domains or transduced by a discrete region of the protein (e.g. the S4-S5 linker) (9Yellen G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The coupling mechanism is usually vectorial; membrane depolarization induces opening of the Kv channels, whereas hyperpolarization induces opening of the HCN channels. In contrast, opening of D540K HERG channels is coupled to both depolarization and hyperpolarization. The single channel conductance of the O and Oh states is identical (20Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), implying that D540K affects the activation gate but not the selectivity filter. A simplified gating scheme for D540K HERG channels is shown (Scheme FSI). In the same manner that depolarization-induced outward movement of the S4 domain is coupled to normal channel opening (3Stuhmer W. Conti F. Suzuki H. Wang X.D. Noda M. Yahagi N. Kubo H. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 4Perozo E. Papazian D.M. Stefani E. Bezanilla F. Biophys.

J. 1994; 66: 1011-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we propose that the voltage dependence of the Oh state derives from hyperpolarization-induced inward movement of S4. We hypothesized that the Lys540 point mutation in HERG causes channels to reopen in response to membrane hyperpolarization because of a direct interaction with the activation gate. Therefore, we sequentially mutated to Ala residues 662–667 located in the C-terminal region of S6. Of the six Ala-substituted double mutants examined, only D540K-R665A HERG channels failed to reopen upon hyperpolarization, suggesting a direct interaction between these two residues was necessary to mediate channel reopening. Mutation of the other five S6 residues to Ala had a variable effect on the ability of the D540K HERG channel to reopen at negative potentials. Mutation of Ile663, Gln664, or Tyr667 (Group 1) had the least effect on channel properties compared with D540K HERG. Mutation of Ile662 or Tyr666 (Group 2) reduced the relative magnitude of inward current activated by hyperpolarization and accelerated the rate of deactivation from the Oh state. Thus, mutation of Ile662 or Tyr666 to Ala reduced the functional consequence of the presumed interaction between D540K and Arg665. A possible explanation for these findings is the location of the Group 2 versus the Group 1 residues relative to Arg665. Using the crystal structure of KcsA, a homology model of HERG was constructed (21Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. . 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). According to this model, Arg665 faces away from the central cavity of the channel. The side groups of Arg665, Ile662, and Tyr666 are clustered together (Fig. 8). In contrast, the Group 1 residues Ile663, Gln664, and Tyr667 project away from Arg665. Mutation of Ile662 or Tyr666 to the smaller Ala may alter the orientation of Arg665 in a manner that results in a diminished interaction with Lys540, whereas mutation of any one of the Group 1 amino acids has no significant effect on the Lys540-Arg665 interaction.Figure 8Putative location of Arg665 and nearby residues in the S6 domain of a HERG channel subunit. The homology model of HERG pore helix-S6 domain was based on the crystal structure of the KcsA potassium channel (7Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5745) Google Scholar). The subunit was rotated by 90o (middle panel) and 180o (right panel). The S5 and S6 domains are colored yellow, and the pore helix is colored green. The six amino acids in S6 that were mutated to Ala are shown in colored space-filling mode: Ile662(blue); Ile663 (orange); Gln664 (cyan); Arg665(red); Leu666 (green); Tyr667 (white). Note that the side chains of Ile662 and Leu666 face toward position Arg665, whereas the side chains Ile663, Gln664, and Tyr667 face away (see text for details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Substitution of Arg665 with a basic residue (Lys), but not an acidic (Asp) or polar residue (Gln), restored the ability of D540K HERG channels to enter the Oh state. Likewise, substitution of Asp540 with a basic amino acid, Arg (Fig. 6 D), but not Ala (14Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar) resulted in channels that were capable of hyperpolarization-induced opening. Thus, basic residues are required at position 540 in the S4-S5 linker and position 665 in the C-terminal region of S6 to enable hyperpolarization-induced channel opening. This finding suggests that electrostatic repulsion repulsion mediates this channel reopening and implies that the C-terminal ends of the S4 and S6 domains are situated in close proximity at negative transmembrane potentials. However, our data do not provide evidence for or against the possibility that charge pairing between Asp540 and Arg665 stabilizes the closed state of WT HERG channels. To further explore the potential importance of electrostatic repulsion between specific residues in the S4-S5 linker and S6 we tested whether introduction of an acidic residue at position 665 would repel Asp540 and allow channels to reopen with hyperpolarization. We were unable to reproduce the property of hyperpolarization-induced channel gating by engineering acidic residues at positions 540 and 665. A possible explanation for this negative result relates to the relative length of the side chains of the residues at these positions. The side chains of Arg and Lys are substantially longer than Asp. Perhaps the side chains of Asp540 and Asp665 are not close enough or favorably oriented for electrostatic repulsion to occur and cause channel reopening. Although R665D HERG channels did not reopen with hyperpolarization, we did observe a dramatic effect on channel gating. Deactivation was markedly slower for R665D HERG compared with WT HERG channels, far in excess than what could be explained by the shift in voltage dependence of activation. Thus, once the open conformation is achieved by depolarization, the transitions to the closed conformation are inhibited by Asp665. Other amino acid substitutions at position 665 (R665A, R665Q) resulted in qualitatively similar but less dramatic effects. In a previous study, we individually mutated residues 646–667 to Ala in the S6 domain of HERG (21Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. . 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Channel deactivation was not significantly affected with the exception of V659A and R665A. V659C channels were also reported to deactivate slowly (22Gillian A.L. Wang J. Tanty T. McCarthy E. Robertson G.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 840AGoogle Scholar). It is possible that amino acid substitutions at specific residues in the S6 domain of HERG slow channel deactivation by impeding rotation of the helical bundle back into its resting conformation. It is conceivable that mutations at positions 540 and 665 may exert independent effects on channel gating. For example, mutation of Asp540 to Lys or Arg could enable inward movement of the S4 domain and cause channel reopening without interacting specifically with Arg665. An additional mutation of Arg665to a nonbasic residue might independently stabilize the closed configuration and prevent the D540K-induced channel reopening. Another possible explanation for our results is that Lys540 and Arg665 may interact by an allosteric mechanism. How is membrane hyperpolarization coupled to channel opening for D540K HERG but not WT HERG? One possibility is that the S4 domain in WT HERG moves inward with hyperpolarization but does not couple to channel opening at negative potentials unless Asp540 is mutated to Lys. This seems unlikely because inward gating currents are not measurable below −120 mV in other Kv channels, including ether-a-go-go channels that share high homology with HERG (5Stefani E. Toro L. Perozo E. Bezanilla F. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 996-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 6Bezanilla F. Perozo E. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1011-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 23Tang C.Y. Bezanilla F. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). More likely, inward movement of the S4 domain is enabled by the D540K mutation. The time and voltage dependence of hyperpolarization-induced activation of D540K HERG is qualitatively similar to activation of HCN pacemaker channels. This suggested to us that an interaction between the S4-S5 linker and the S6 domain could mediate activation of HCN channels. Indeed, several mutations in the S4-S5 linker of HCN channels disrupted normal channel closure as though the link between voltage-sensing and channel opening was uncoupled (24Chen J. Mitcheson J., S. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, the S4-S5 linker may physically couple S4 movement with the opening of both HERG and HCN channels. Further support for the importance of interactions between the S4-S5 linker and the C-terminal portion of S6 in channel gating comes from studies of chimeric Shaker and KcsA channels. Chimeric channels containing the pore module of KcsA (inner helix, pore domain, outer helix, and C terminus) inserted into the background of the voltage-sensing module of Shaker (S1-S4 and S4-S5 linker) traffic normally but do not gate in response to membrane depolarization (25Caprini M. Ferroni S. Planells-Cases R. Rueda J. Rapisarda C. Ferrer-Montiel A. Montal M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21070-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, if the C terminus of Shaker is included in the chimera, the resulting channel opens in a voltage-dependent fashion (26Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. Nature. 2001; 413: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The specific residues of the C terminus that perform a critical role in transduction of voltage sensing to chimeric channel activation remain to be determined but may be analogous to the interactions described here for D540K HERG. In summary, the hyperpolarization-dependent reopening of D540K HERG channels is mediated by charge repulsion between Lys540 located in the S4-S5 linker and Arg665 located in the C-terminal end of the S6 domain. The bell-shaped voltage dependence of activation suggests that the S4 domain of D540K HERG can move inward in response to membrane hyperpolarization. We speculate that inward movement of the S4 domain with hyperpolarization is normally restricted by a stabilizing interaction between the S4-S5 linker and the C-terminal region of S6. Finally, our findings that Lys540 interacts with Arg665 puts constraints on the possible conformation of the HERG channel with respect to the location of the C-terminal ends of the S4 and S6 domains.

Indeed, LFAH actually retains both hydroxylase and desaturase activity, indicating that these two oxidation reactions can be catalyzed by the same enzyme. Amino acid sequence alignments (Table I) of these two oleate hydroxylases with several oleate desaturases indicated that there are only a few conserved desaturase residues that are not conserved in the hydroxylases (3Broun P.

The oleate desaturase and oleate hydroxylase enzymes are members of a large class of membrane-bound enzymes that contain a tripartite histidine sequence motif and two putative membrane-spanning domains (4Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The enzymes are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (5Dyer J.M. Mullen R.T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26935-26940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a reaction that also requires molecular oxygen and reducing equivalents, provided by cytochrome b5. Members of a family of soluble enzymes that includes fatty acid desaturases (e.g.stearoyl-acyl carrier protein Δ9 desaturase) and hydrocarbon monooxygenases (e.g. methane monooxygenase) catalyze a similar array of oxidative chemistry (7Wallar B.J.

These enzymes utilize a di-iron center to catalyze desaturation or hydroxylation reactions. Despite intense study, there is no definitive evidence to explain the divergent activities of these enzymes that share similar di-iron centers and protein folds. The membrane-bound class of enzymes also contain two catalytically relevant iron atoms per subunit that are proposed to be ligated by the His residues that comprise the characteristic sequence motif (4Shanklin J.

The occurrence of highly homologous desaturases and hydroxylases that use the same substrate presents an excellent opportunity to study the molecular determinants of catalytic specificity (desaturation versushydroxylation). In this study, we report that incorporating a small set of the castor hydroxylase residues into the Arabidopsis FAD2 produces an enzyme that performs as well as wild-type hydroxylase enzymes when expressed in A. thaliana. Furthermore, the contributions of the individual residues in determining product outcome have been assessed by analyzing a series of single, double, and triple mutants of FAD2 through expression in both A. thaliana andSaccharomyces cerevisiae.

The vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 pMP90 by electroporation and used to transform A. thaliana FAD2-deficient plants (12Okuley J. Lightner J. Feldmann K. Yadav N.

Genes were cloned into pYes-II for expression in S. cerevisiae YPH499 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) or INVSCI (Invitrogen) with HindIII/EcoRI sites for the Lesquerella mutants orAcc65I/EcoRI sites for the fad2mutants. Upon transformation of the yeast with a lithium acetate method (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright D.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar), cultures (1 ml) were initially grown on SC−URA medium (yeast synthetic complete medium devoid of uracil, Sigma) supplemented with 1% casamino acids and 2% glucose. Once cells reached an optical density (600 nm) of ∼2, the cells were washed with glucose-free medium, resuspended in SC−URA containing 1% casamino acids and 2% galactose, and grown at 30 °C for 48 h. For stereochemistry studies, [12-2H1](R)-stearoyl methyl ester, [12-2H1](S)-stearoyl methyl ester, or [12-2H1](S)-oleoyl methyl ester (the generous gift of Chris Savile and Dr. Peter Buist, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada) was added as an ethanolic solution to a sterile glass tube. When using the labeled methyl stearate, cerulenin (10 μg/ml, Sigma) and myristic acid (20 μg/ml) were added to the tubes and the ethanolic solvent was removed by evaporation; we found that the presence of ethanol (0.5–1%) substantially decreased hydroxy fatty acid accumulation. SC−URA medium (1 ml) containing 1% casamino acids, 2% glucose (or galactose for induction) and 0.5% Tergitol NP-40 was added to the dry tubes prior to inoculation. Seeds were methylated (1 ml of 1n HCl-methanol (Supelco), 80 °C for 1 h), extracted with hexane, and trimethylsilylated (100 μl of BSTFA-TMCS ([N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide-trimethylchlorosilane], Supelco), 90 °C for 45 min). The BSTFA-TMCS was removed by evaporation and the sample resuspended in hexane. Yeast pellets were dried by a nitrogen stream prior to methylation, and, when fatty acids were added during growth, cell pellets were washed with 1% Tergitol and then water before drying. Samples were analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 5973 mass selective detector (GC/MS) and a J&W DB-23 capillary column (60 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The injector was held at 225 °C, the oven temperature was varied (100–160 °C at 25 °C/min, then 10 °C/min to 240 °C), and a helium flow of 1.1 ml/min was maintained. As illustrated in TableI, residues 63, 104, 148, 217, 295, 322, and 324 of FAD2 differ from the corresponding residues found in the closely related LFAH and CFAH. The replacement of all seven (L7M) or a subset of four (104, 148, 322, and 324, L4M) residues of FAD2 with those from LFAH gives rise to variant FAD2 enzymes that catalyze both desaturation and hydroxylation. Because residues 63, 148, and 324 of the Lesquerella and castor oleate hydroxylases (A. thaliana FAD2 numbering) are different, we also constructed variant fad2 genes incorporating either seven or four of these substitutions using the corresponding residues of the castor oleate hydroxylase. In an effort to dissect the contribution of individual amino acids in determining product distribution, we constructed a set of variant fad2 genes containing one, two, or three amino acid substitutions. The variant fad2 genes were introduced into A. thaliana FAD2-deficient plants byAgrobacterium-mediated transformation. Trimethysilylated fatty acid methyl esters from seeds harvested from T2 plants (heterozygous) were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to determine the overall fatty acid composition. The results are shown in Fig. 1. All FAD2 variants expressed inArabidopsis gave detectable amounts of hydroxy fatty acids, ranging from 0.03 to 22%. Furthermore, similar distribution patterns of the hydroxy fatty acids (18:1-OH > 18:2-OH > 20:1-OH >> 20:2-OH) were observed in all plants. Interestingly, the wild-type FAD2 enzyme also produced detectable levels of ricinoleic acid (average of 0.03% of total fatty acids). Because ricinoleic acid was detected in seeds of both wild-type and FAD2-deficient plants transformed with fad2 but not in untransformed A. thaliana FAD2-deficient plants, the hydroxylation activity must be associated with FAD2. Analysis of the transgenic plants expressing FAD2 variants that incorporated substitutions corresponding to their equivalents from the castor hydroxylase gene residues revealed different phenotypes than were observed with the corresponding Lesquerellasubstitutions. The introduction of four amino acid substitutions (A104G/T148I/S322A/M324V, or C4M) generated an enzyme that produced levels of hydroxy fatty acids (up to 22%) similar to those obtained upon expression of the wild-type CFAH in ArabidopsisFAD2-deficient plants (also under control of the napin promoter) (15Broun P. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A large range of hydroxy fatty acid product was observed among independent lines, presumably because of differences in the context of the insertion site or the gene copy number. In addition to demonstrating substantial hydroxylase activity, C4M and C7M produced roughly equivalent amounts of linoleic acid and ricinoleic acid in transgenic plants (Fig. 2). When compared with the results obtained upon expression of L4M or L7M, where desaturation dominates hydroxylation, it is clear that the high levels of hydroxy fatty acids observed in several lines of A. thaliana FAD2-deficient/C4M plants result from an improved enzyme specificity toward hydroxylation and not simply from optimal transgene context. Most of the FAD2 variants, with the exception of some of the plants expressing C4M or C7M, retained sufficient desaturase activity to complement the FAD2-deficient background (25–30% linoleic acid). Among the FAD2 variants with single amino acid changes, T148I and M324I caused the most dramatic change in phenotype, producing up to 4.2 and 5.4% hydroxy fatty acids, respectively (Fig. 1). FAD2 variants A104G, S322A, and T148N (a Lesquerella substitution) produced less than 1% hydroxy fatty acids. Among the double mutants analyzed, C2M.1 (T148I/M324V) and C2M.5 (T148I/S322A) produced higher levels (4.5 and 3.1%) of hydroxy fatty acids than C2M.2 (A104G/S322A), C2M.3 (A104G/M324V), and C2M.6 (S322A/M324V), which gave less than 0.2%. The triple mutants C3M.1 (A104G/T148I/M324V), C3M.2 (A104G/T148I/S322A), and C3M.4 (T148I/S322A/M324V) generated far more hydroxylated fatty acids (9–16%) than did C3M.3 (A104G/S322A/M324V) (0.7%). Taken together, these data reveal a dominant role of Ile at position 148 in specifying hydroxylation, and indicate that a single amino acid change (M324I) can impart a substantial shift in catalytic specificity. Given the variability observed between independent transgenic plant lines (Fig. 1), the amount of time required to generate transgenic plants, and our desire to compare the specificity of numerous FAD2 variant enzymes, we have explored the use of S. cerevisiaeas a complementary host system. The various enzymes were cloned into the pYes-II expression vector behind a GAL-1 promoter as previously described (3Broun P. Shanklin J. Whittle E. Somerville C. Science. 1998; 282: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Expression of FAD2 and LFAH was then tested in the yeast strains INVSCI and YPH499 (a strain that Hills and collaborators had reported accumulation of high levels of 18:2 upon expression of a FAD2 enzyme (Ref. 16Brown A.P. Dann R. Bowra S. Hills M.J. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1998; 75: 77-82Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) and at multiple temperatures (15, 22, and 30 °C). The highest product accumulation was obtained with the YPH499 strain induced at 30 °C (16Brown A.P. Dann R. Bowra S. Hills M.J. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1998; 75: 77-82Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We also found that induction at high starting cell densities led to higher product accumulation; inducing at anA600 of 2.5 resulted in the accumulation of 30% diene (from FAD2 expression) or 27% hydroxylated fatty acids (from LFAH expression), as compared with 17 and 18%, respectively, when the cultures were induced at an A600 of 0.2. Expression of the castor oleate hydroxylase under all conditions resulted in cessation of yeast growth, and cultures failed to accumulate detectable product. Because of ricinoleic acid accumulation of up to ∼25% upon expression of LFAH, this toxicity cannot be attributed to the accumulation of ricinoleic acid. TableII contains the results of the expression of parental enzymes, quadruple mutants L4M and C4M, all possible triple (C3M) and double (C2M) mutant combinations with the C4M residues, and all single mutants that contain Lesquerella or castor substitutions. Although all the enzymes acted upon palmitoleate in addition to oleate, only the data from oleate oxidation is shown because the higher specificity toward oleate permitted more precise measurements of the products obtained from oleate oxidation at lower concentrations. As observed by their transgenic expression in plants, LFAH and FAD2 produce both desaturation and hydroxylation products. A recent publication by Smith et al. (17Smith M. Moon H. Kunst L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) reported that CFAH also produces linoleic acid when expressed in yeast, albeit to a lesser extent than LFAH. The collection of variant FAD2 enzymes included in Table II contains enzymes exhibiting product ratios intermediate between those of the parental enzymes. There is a strong correlation (r = 0.88) between the hydroxylation specificity observed in yeast and the accumulation of hydroxy fatty acids in plants, suggesting that the information obtained from yeast expression has predictive value regarding relative activity upon expression inA. thaliana. Because both ricinoleic acid and linoleic acid are end products in yeast, whereas they are further metabolized inA. thaliana, a precise product ratio is obtained more readily from expression in yeast than expression in A. thaliana. Although we would expect protein expression levels to have an effect on the amounts of enzymic product observed, the catalytic specificity of the enzymes should not be affected by such variations.Table IICatalytic specificity of A. thaliana FAD2 and L. fendleri oleate hydroxylase variants as determined by product analysis of S. cerevisiae culturesEnzyme/variantFAD2 amino acid substitution(s)12-OH-18:1Δ918:2Δ9,12Hydroxylation/desaturation ± S.E.Increase2-a-Fold increase of hydroxylation over desaturation with respect to FAD2.%%-foldFAD20.1626.10.006 ± 0.0011.0A104GA104G0.215.50.013 ± 0.0042.1T148NT148N0.2211.00.02 ± 0.0023.3T148IT148I0.364.00.09 ± 0.01114.8S322AS322A0.1517.80.008 ± 0.0011.3M324IM324I1.64.90.33 ± 0.0754.1M324VM324V1.23.90.30 ± 0.0449.2C2M.1T148I/M324V0.95.60.16 ± 0.01826.2C2M.2A104G/S322A0.0633.40.019 ± 0.0023.1C2M.3A104G/M324V0.063.70.016 ± 0.0022.6C2M.4A104G/T148I1.26.60.18 ± 0.01229.5C2M.5T148I/S322A0.764.90.16 ± 0.00126.2C2M.6S322A/M324V0.2519.70.013 ± 0.0012.1C3M.1A104G/T148I/M324V1.88.10.22 ± 0.02436.1C3M.2A104G/T148I/S322A1.55.50.27 ± 0.01644.3C3M.3A104G/S322A/M324V0.3814.60.026 ± 0.0024.3C3M.4T148I/S322A/M324V0.824.00.21 ± 0.02134.4L4MA104G/T148N/S322A/M324I0.96.40.15 ± 0.05024.6C4MA104G/T148I/S322A/M324V1.22.20.55 ± 0.05790.2LFAH18.26.72.72 ± 0.2442.6LFAH-N149I12.22.45.1 ± 1.0836.1The percentage values, indicating the composition in the fatty acid sample, are mean values based on at least three measurements.2-a -Fold increase of hydroxylation over desaturation with respect to FAD2. Open table in a new tab The percentage values, indicating the composition in the fatty acid sample, are mean values based on at least three measurements. Based on transgenic expression in S. cerevisiae, C4M exhibited the highest hydroxylation/desaturation product ratio among all FAD2 variants at 0.55 (the average was 0.91 in planta, data from Fig. 2). C4M is a more specific hydroxylase than L4M, and the castor hydroxylase is a more specific hydroxylase than theLesquerella hydroxylase. This implies that at least some of the specificity determinants of the castor hydroxylase are contained within the C4M residues. Only two of these residues (148 and 324) are different between L4M (Asn-148 and Ile-324) and C4M (Ile-148 and Val-324). Inspection of the product ratios of these four single mutants (Table II) demonstrates that there is little difference between M324V and M324I, whereas there is a 4.5-fold difference between the product ratios of T148N and T148I, suggesting that the T148I mutation is key to determining the product distribution of C4M and the castor hydroxylase. The results from the single mutants clearly demonstrate that each of the single mutations is sufficient to increase the hydroxylation activity of the FAD2 desaturase. Whereas T148N, A104G, and S322A give modest changes in the product distribution (<3.3-fold increase in hydroxylation specificity), T148I, M324I, and M324V dramatically alter the product distribution (15–54-fold). The T148I, M324I, and M324V mutations affect the accumulation of both desaturated and hydroxylated product. For example, by simply substituting Val for Met at residue 324, the amount of desaturation product decreased 6.7-fold while the amount of hydroxylation product increased ∼7.5-fold. Analysis of the double mutants clearly supports the significance of T148I in determining product distribution. All three double mutants that contain T148I exhibit increased hydroxylation and decreased desaturation (26–30-fold increase in hydroxylation specificity over that of FAD2), whereas those that do not contain T148I display reduced desaturation but very little change in hydroxylation (<3.1-fold increase in hydroxylation specificity). Interestingly, the effects of M324V appear to be largely masked when combined with all other mutations; only the T148I/M324V double mutant retains high hydroxylation activity, and this may be attributed to the contribution of T148I. The triple mutants further confirm the importance of T148I, as only those triple mutants that include T148I have markedly increased hydroxylation specificity (25–44-fold increase over FAD2). Given the product distribution variability observed when position 148 of FAD2 was changed to the corresponding residue of CFAH or LFAH, we sought to determine whether we could alter the specificity of LFAH by replacing the equivalent residue (Asn-149) with either the FAD2 (Thr) or CFAH (Ile) residue. We found that the reaction specificity of LFAH was modified from a value of 2.7 (hydroxylation:desaturation ratio) to 1.08 when Asn-149 was replaced with Thr (Table III). Replacement of Asn-149 with the CFAH equivalent (Ile) created an enzyme with an increased hydroxylation specificity of 5.1.Table IIICatalytic specificity of LFAH, LFAH-N149T, and LFAH-N149I as a function of the substrateSubstrateEnzymeLFAHLFAH-N149TLFAH-N149I18:1Δ92.71 ± 0.201.08 ± 0.145.1 ± 1.016:1Δ90.29 ± 0.0190.21 ± 0.0450.59 ± 0.12Values represent the ratio of hydroxylation product to desaturation product for the given substrate.

Standard error is derived from three experiments. As previously reported, the oleate desaturase and hydroxylase enzymes oxidize palmitoleic acid in addition to oleic acid (3Broun P. Shanklin J. Whittle E. Somerville C. Science. 1998; 282: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 29Covello P.S. Reed D.W. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In yeast cells that contain approximately equal quantities of the two monounsaturated fatty acids, FAD2 produces roughly 7.5 times as much 18:2 as 16:2 and LFAH roughly 24 times as much 12-OH 18:1Δ9 as 12-OH 16:1Δ9. What is interesting is that the hydroxylation to desaturation ratio for LFAH is quite different for the two substrates, as illustrated in Table III; it is 2.7 for 18:1Δ9 and 0.29 for 16:1Δ9, approximately a 10-fold difference. Although this bias could be attributed to differential metabolism of the hydroxy fatty acids, the fact that both of these ratios follow the same trend within the series of Lesquerella variants (more hydroxylation for LFAH-N149I, less hydroxylation for LFAH-N149T; data in Table III) suggests that the bias is associated with the mechanism of the partitioning between desaturation and hydroxylation. The catalytic mechanism of the variant FAD2 enzymes was investigated through analysis of the oxidation products of stereospecifically lab"
https://openalex.org/W2011178652,"Fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36 is a glycoprotein involved in multiple membrane functions including uptake of long-chain fatty acids and oxidized low density lipoprotein. In mice, expression of the gene is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α in the liver and by PPARγ in the adipose tissues (Motojima, K., Passilly, P. P., Peters, J. M., Gonzalez, F. J., and Latruffe, N. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 16710–16714). However, the time course of PPARα ligand-induced expression of FAT/CD36 in the liver, and also in the cultured hepatoma cells, is significantly slower than those of other PPARα target genes. To study the molecular mechanism of the slow transcriptional activation of the gene by a PPAR ligand, we first cloned the 5′ ends of the mRNA and then the mouse gene promoter region from a genomic bacterial artificial chromosome library. Sequencing analyses showed that transcription of the gene starts at two initiation sites 16 kb apart and splicing occurs alternatively, producing at least three mRNA species with different 5′-noncoding regions. The PPARα ligand-responsive promoter in the liver was identified as the new upstream promoter where we found several possible binding sites for lipid metabolism-related transcriptional factors but not for PPAR. Neither promoter responded to a PPARα ligand in thein vitro or in vivo reporter assays using cultured hepatoma cells and the liver of living mice. We also have cloned the human FAT/CD36 gene from a bacterial artificial chromosome library and identified a new independent promoter that is located 13 kb upstream of the previously reported promoter. Only the upstream promoter responded to PPARα and PPARγ ligands in a cell type-specific manner. The absence of PPRE in the responding upstream promoter region, the delayed activation by the ligand, and the results of the reporter assays all suggested that transcriptional activation of the FAT/CD36 gene by PPAR ligands is indirectly dependent on PPAR.

Studies using the FAT/CD36-deficient rodents suggested that this molecule is involved in the action of insulin, long-chain fatty acid, and lipid metabolism (14Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Wallace C.A.

A case control study on people with FAT/CD36 deficiency also supported the results obtained in rodents (17Miyaoka K. Kuwasako T. Hirano K.-I. Nosaki S. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Lancet. 2001; 357: 686-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, not all the results of rodents and human studies are consistent. The reported phenotypes of FAT/CD36-deficient rodents and of human patients are considerably variable between studies except the increased nonesterified fatty acid concentrations and the reciprocally decreased glucose concentrations in serum (18Iizuka Y. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. Lancet. 2001; 358: 243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that other genetic and/or environmental factors, in addition to FAT/CD36 deficiency, are also strongly associated with the overall phenotypes and the onset of several diseases, but they also suggest that FAT/CD36 is actually a fatty acid transporter in adipocytes and muscle cells. This was further supported by the demonstration that a defect in human myocardial long-chain fatty acid uptake is caused by FAT/CD36 mutations (19Tanaka T. Nakata T. Oka T. Ogawa T. Okamoto F. Kusaka Y. Sohmiya K. Shimamoto K. Itakura K. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 751-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the FAT/CD36 gene should be properly regulated to ensure its unique functions in various cell types. FAT/CD36 expression has been studied most extensively on macrophages and is known to be regulated by cytokines (20Wu K.S. Moulton H. Barnett J. Parthasarathy S. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8102-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Yesner L.M. Huh H.Y. Pearce S.F. Silverstein R.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). We studied the effects of PPARα and PPARγ ligands on the expression levels of FAT/CD36 mRNA in mouse tissues and showed that the mRNA is induced by PPARα in the liver and by PPARγ ligands in adipose tissues (22Motojima K. Passilly P.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The time course of mRNA induction by a PPARα ligand in the liver is significantly slower than those of other typical PPARα target genes, although the essential role of PPARα in transcriptional activation was evident because of its disappearance in PPARα-null mice (22Motojima K. Passilly P.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). These differences suggested that the same mechanism of transcriptional activation is not operating on the FAT/CD36 gene as on other PPARα target genes. However, extensive studies on the PPARγ ligand-induced expression of the human FAT/CD36 gene in monocyte-macrophages showed that the human gene promoter binds PPARγ and is activated by its ligands in a normal fashion (6Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvalez J.G.A. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The PPRE identified by its DR1 sequence (7Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G.A. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) is not typical, although Tontonoz et al. (7Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G.A. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) showed its capability to bind PPARγ, and the transactivation by the receptor and its ligand conducted in cultured CV-1 cells using the minimal length of the promoter sequence was not as large as that of the endogenous gene in monocyte-macrophages (7Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G.A. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). They did not fully describe the physiological responses of the human FAT/CD36 gene because the structural analysis of the gene was not sufficient. Therefore, we decided to characterize the detailed structures of the FAT/CD36 genes of mouse and then of human. The results obtained here by analysis of the mouse and human FAT/CD36 genes demonstrated that the promoter described previously is the proximal promoter that does not respond to PPAR ligands. Both genes have another independent promoter located far upstream, which indirectly responds to the ligands. (4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinyl-thio)acetic acid (Wy14,643) was purchased from Tokyo-Kasei (Tokyo, Japan), and bezafibrate was from Sigma. All the thiazolidindiones were synthesized at Nippon Chemiphar (Misato, Japan). Troglitazone, pioglitazone-HCl (pioglitazone), and BRL-49653 were synthesized as described (23Fukui Y. Masui S. Osada S. Umesono K. Motojima K. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Dual Luciferase reporter assay system and pGL reporter plasmids were purchased from Promega. KOD™ polymerase and restriction enzymes were obtained from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and a random primer labeling kit were purchased from Muromachi Kagaku (Tokyo, Japan) and Takara (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-human FAT/CD36 was purchased from Ylem (Rome, Italy). Normal male NZB mice (5–6 weeks old) were kept under a 12-h light-dark cycle and provided with food and water ad libitum. Mice were fed either a control diet (CE7, Clea Japan) or that containing 0.05% Wy14,643 for 1–7 days. In vivo electroporation of plasmid DNA into the liver of mice was performed as described. 2Fujishiro, K., Fukui, Y., Sato, O., Kawabe, K., Seto, K., and Motojima, K. (2002) Mol. Cell. Biochem. (in press).Briefly, plasmid DNA in 15 μl of phosphate-buffered saline was injected and square electric pulses were applied 10 times at 99-ms intervals at 25 V using an ElectroSquarePorator T820 (BTX, a division of Genetronics Inc., San Diego, CA). After injection, mice were fed control diet (CE7) or a diet containing Wy14,643 (0.05%) for 7 days. The extract of the liver was prepared, and the luciferase activities were measured. Fao cells, a subclone of rat hepatoma HIIE cells, were cultured in Ham’s F-12 medium under the conditions reported previously (22Motojima K. Passilly P.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells and human monocyte-macrophages HL-60 and THP-1 (kind gifts from Prof. Y. Kobayashi, Toho University, Chiba, Japan) were cultured in standard medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 25 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% bovine serum). 3T3L1 pre-adipocytes were cultured in standard medium. Adipocyte differentiation was induced as described previously (23Fukui Y. Masui S. Osada S. Umesono K. Motojima K. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A PPAR ligand was added to the medium as a concentrated solution in Me2SO dissolved completely by sonication. The final concentrations of the ligands were: Wy14,643, 50 μm; bezafibrate, 200 μm; troglitazone, 1 μm; pioglitazone, 1 μm; BRL-49653, 1 μm. The same concentrations were used in the cell culture studies and reporter assays. Transfection was performed in 24-well plates with SuperFect™ (Qiagen) for Fao cells and TransFast™ (Promega) for 3T3L1 cells according to the manufacturers’ protocols. For transactivation studies, we used 0.02 μg/well pRL-TK DNA as an internal control (Promega) and 0.98 μg/well reporter DNA. The transfected cells were cultured in growth media in the presence or absence of PPAR ligands. The luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA was prepared from the mouse liver and cultured cells by the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Northern blotting analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (22Motojima K. Passilly P.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), except that hybridization was performed in Express Hyb™ hybridization solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 3 h. After hybridization, the membranes were washed and autoradiographed with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. For quantitative analysis, a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan) was used. The cDNAs to detect individual isoforms of the mouse FAT/CD36 mRNA were prepared by amplification of total cDNA using following the exon 1A- or 1B-specific primers: 1A-left, 5′-CTTGTGGCCTTGCACTCTCTCATCG; 1A-right, 5′-TCAGAAGGCAGTACACAGAAG; 1B-left, 5′-TGAGGACTTTTCTTCTTCACAGCTGCC; 1B-right, 5′-TCAGAAGGCAGCTGTGAAGAAG. After PCR, the fragments were cloned and their identities were confirmed by sequencing. The cDNA probes were prepared by PCR of the plasmid DNAs. Isolation and identification of other cDNAs used as probes have been described previously (22Motojima K. Passilly P.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). For the mouse mRNA analysis, total RNA was prepared from the liver, intestine, muscle, and fat of mice fed either a control diet or that containing Wy14,643 for 7 days as described above. The cDNAs were synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcriptase (CLONTECH). The FAT/CD36 isoform cDNAs were amplified by 35 cycles of PCR using the primer combinations of exon 1A- or exon 1B-specific left primer and exon 2-specific common right primer. For the human mRNA analysis, total RNA was prepared from HepG2 cells and THP-1 cells treated with PPAR ligands and the cDNAs were synthesized from 5 μg of total RNAs using oligo(dT) primer or random primers and reverse transcriptase (CLONTECH). The FAT/CD36 isoform cDNAs were amplified by 35 cycles of PCR using the combinations of an exon 1A-specific left primer (5′-ACACAACCAGAGTCTTCGGTGTTAA) or exon 1B-specific left primer (5′-GCATTTGATTGAAAAATCCTTCTTAGCC) and an exon 2-specific common right primer (5′-GGTCTCCAACTGGCATTAGAATACC). Reaction products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. All the major DNA fragments were cloned into theHincII site of pUC18 after treatment with KOD polymerase to make their ends blunt and sequenced for their identification. The cDNAs containing the 5′ end sequences of mouse and human FAT/CD36 mRNAs were obtained by a 5′-RACE method (22Motojima K. Passilly P.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of poly(A) RNA isolated from the livers of mice fed Wy14,643 for 5 days or from 10 μg of total RNA isolated from HepG2 cells. The cDNA was divided into three tubes and tailed with 10 units of terminal transferase (Takara) and 0.2 mm dCTP at 37 °C for 3, 10, or 30 min. The mixture of the tailed cDNAs was amplified by PCR using oligo(dG) and a mouse FAT/CD36-specific primer, 5′-TCCAGTAATGAGCCCACAGTTCCGAT, corresponding to nucleotides 84–119 of the published rat sequence (4Abumrad N.A. Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession no. NM031561), or a human FAT/CD36-specific primer, 5′-GGTCTCCAACTGGCATTAGAATACC, corresponding to the sequence in the exon 2a (25Taylor K.T. Tang Y. Sobieski D.A. Lipsky R.H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Tang Y. Taylor K.T. Sobieski D.A. Medved E.S. Lipsky R.H. J. Biol.

After PCR, KOD polymerase was added to the PCR mixture to make the ends of the amplified DNA fragments blunt. The DNA fragments were purified using a column (Qiagen) and cloned into theHincII site of pUC18. The transformants on Escherichia coli JM109 were randomly selected and sequenced to identify FAT/CD36 cDNA clones. A possible new promoter sequence of the mouse FAT/CD36 gene was isolated by degenerate PCR using a mouse GenomeWalker™ kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The primer of the following sequence was designed from the new cDNA sequence obtained above: 5′-ATAACGGCTTCCAGTAATGATCCCACAGT. After a second PCR using the same primers as described above and the adapter primer 2 supplied with the kit, the blunt-ended PCR products were purified on agarose gels and cloned into the HincII site of pUC18. Similarly, the previously reported promoter region was cloned by PCR using the following primers (4Abumrad N.A. Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): R1, 5′-ATAACGGCTCCAGTAATGAGCCCACAGT; R2, 5′-TCCAGTAATGAGCCCACAGTTCCGAT. For a possible new and the previously reported promoter sequences of the human FAT/CD36 gene, the same method as above was employed. Primers of the following sequences were designed from the new cDNA sequence obtained as described above and the published sequence (27Armesilla A.L. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18985-18991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): MR1, 5′-AGAAGTCCGATGAAAGAGCACAAGGC; MR2, 5′-GGATGCTAGTTGGGAAGACCAGGGAA; VR1, 5′-GAAGGATTTTTCAATCAAATGCTCCAACA; VR2, 5′-CAATTCTTAATAGGATCAAATCTTCCTGT. After nested PCR, the blunt-ended PCR products were purified on agarose gels and cloned into the HincII site of pUC18. High density filters of BAC Mouse ES (Rel. II) genomic library (IncyteGenomics, Inc.) were screened using the mouse cDNA for the coding region of FAT/CD36 (4Abumrad N.A. Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Motojima K. Passilly P.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Six positive BAC clones were purchased and analyzed by Southern blotting to choose a clone containing a long promoter region. For the human genomic clones, high density filters of BAC Human (Rel. II) genomic library (IncyteGenomics, Inc.) were screened using the cDNA fragment obtained by RT-PCR as described above under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Four positive BAC clones were purchased and analyzed by Southern blotting to choose a clone containing a long promoter region. For sequencing of the plasmids containing long inserts, a series of plasmids containing a transposon at a random site were constructed using GPS™-1 genome priming system (BioLabs). A SequiTherm EXCEL II Long-Read™ DNA sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies) was used for the reaction, and the fragments were analyzed by a DNA sequencer (LI-COR model 4000). We have shown previously that the PPARα ligand Wy14,643 induces expression of FAT/CD36 mRNA in the mouse liver. We also noticed a longer lag time before induction of the mRNA than other PPARα target gene mRNAs (22Motojima K. Passilly P.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). To verify the delayed induction of FAT/CD36 mRNA by the ligand, we carried out a detailed time-course study to quantify the changes in the levels of FAT/CD36 and typical PPARα ligand-inducible mRNAs such as peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme (HD), liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), and mitochondrial long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (LACS) (28Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,A and B). Upon intraperitoneal injection of Wy14,643, all except FAT/CD36 mRNA were markedly induced in the mouse liver after a time lag of a few hours, as evidenced by Northern blotting. Feeding a diet containing Wy14,643 also largely elevated the levels of the mRNAs in a day, and the induced levels were maintained for several days. In contrast, the FAT/CD36 mRNA remained at a low level for 1 day and gradually increased, reaching the maximum level at day 3–4. Thus, it is clear that the PPARα ligand-induced expression of FAT/CD36 mRNA was significantly delayed as compared with other typical PPARα-regulated mRNAs. To examine whether the delayed induction of FAT/CD36 mRNA by the PPARα ligand in the liver was caused by secondary effects of the ligand-induced changes in other tissues, we next measured changes in the levels of the mRNAs in the PPARα-responsive hepatoma Fao cells (Fig. 1C). The mRNAs for the established PPARα-target genes such as AOx, HD, L-FABP, and LACS were induced by the addition of Wy14,643 after a lag of 4–6 h, whereas FAT/CD36 mRNA was induced after a much longer lag of 10–12 h. Thus, the mechanism of the PPARα-dependent transcriptional activation of the FAT/CD36 gene is not exactly the same as that of other typical PPARα target genes. Replication of the in vivo delayed response in the cultured cells indicated that metabolism or signaling events in extrahepatic tissues do not play an essential role in the induction mechanism. To study the molecular mechanism of the delayed induction of mouse FAT/CD36 gene expression by a PPARα ligand, we analyzed the promoter structure of the gene. cDNA cloning of the 5′ end of the mRNA from the liver of Wy14,643-fed mice by the 5′-RACE method yielded a clone containing a 5′ end sequence different from the published sequence. BLAST search of the unique 72-bp 5′ end sequence showed good homology with a rat FAT/CD36 cDNA clone (29Fukuwatari T. Kawada T. Tsuruta M. Hiraoka T. Iwanaga T. Sugimoto E. Fushiki T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig.2A), suggesting that the sequence was not a cloning artifact but was transcribed from the first alternative exon and that it has some physiological significance. To determine the organization of the mouse FAT/CD36 gene, we first cloned the previously reported promoter and the possible adjacent upstream sequences of the new 72-bp sequence using a GenomeWalker™ kit. After confirming the cloned genomic fragments by sequencing, a BAC mouse genomic library was screened using the cDNA fragment for the coding region (4Abumrad N.A. Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNAs from six positive BAC clones were analyzed by Southern blotting for the presence of both the new 72-bp sequence and the published FAT/CD36 cDNA sequence, again confirming that both sequences were included on each BAC insert. All the BAC inserts also included the two possible promoter sequences. These results excluded the possibility that the new 72-bp sequence was derived from a different place from the FAT/CD36 gene by a cloning artifact. One BAC clone was chosen and further analyzed by subcloning and sequencing, as summarized in Fig. 2B. The sequences of the BAC subclones from a single clone completely overlapped with those of the GenomeWalker™ fragments, and the distance between the two exons was estimated by Southern blotting analysis as 16 kb. To further confirm that our new cDNA and the published one arose from the same gene, we next analyzed RT-PCR cDNA clones by sequencing all the major bands shown in Fig.3B. As summarized in Fig.3A, the cDNA fragments containing exon 3 and exon 4 sequence contained either exon 1A or exon 1B sequence and no clones contained both of the exons. Thus, at least three mRNA species with different 5′-noncoding regions were identified by cloning and sequencing. These results indicated that the mouse FAT/CD36 gene has two alternative and independent first exons, and the new first exon is located 16 kb upstream from that published previously (5Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During preparation of this report, we performed BLAST search again in GenBank™ data base and found a rat genomic sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AF317787) corresponding to the upstream promoter of the mouse FAT/CD36 gene. Comparison of the sequences revealed that several dispersed regions in the promoters from position −1 to −1,800 relative to the transcriptional start site are conserved well. In particular, more than 90% of the nucleotides in the regions from position −1 to −160 are identical between the two genes, further confirming the unique structures of the FAT/CD36 genes. To examine whether the dual promoter structure of the FAT/CD36 gene found in the mouse is conserved in the human gene, we first analyzed the 5′ end structure of the FAT/CD36 mRNA by the 5′-RACE method.

However, the relationship between these different functions and the enzyme's mechanism of secretion is not fully understood. We have investigated the role of tTGase in cell migration using two stably transfected fibroblast cell lines in which expression of tTGase in its active and inactive (C277S mutant) states is inducible through the tetracycline-regulated system. Cells overexpressing both forms of tTGase showed increased cell attachment and decreased cell migration on fibronectin. Both forms of the enzyme could be detected on the cell surface, but only the clone overexpressing catalytically active tTGase deposited the enzyme into the ECM and cell growth medium. Cells overexpressing the inactive form of tTGase did not deposit the enzyme into the ECM or secrete it into the cell culture medium. Similar results were obtained when cells were transfected with tTGase mutated at Tyr274 (Y274A), the proposed site for the cis,trans peptide bond, suggesting that tTGase activity and/or its tertiary conformation dependent on this bond may be essential for its externalization mechanism. These results indicate that tTGase regulates cell motility as a novel cell-surface adhesion protein rather than as a matrix-cross-linking enzyme. They also provide further important insights into the mechanism of externalization of the enzyme into the extracellular matrix.

Transglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13) are a group of Ca2+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the post-translational modification of proteins through the incorporation of primary amines into the γ-carboxamide group of glutamine residues or by the cross-linking of proteins via ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine bridges (1.Folk J.E. Finlayson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1977; 31: 1-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Proteins cross-linked as a result of transglutaminase-catalyzed reactions are generally more resistant to mechanical, chemical, and proteolytic breakdown.

Binding of GTP/GDP to the enzyme is thought to increase the tTGase tertiary structure stability and in a viable cell keeps the enzyme inactive as a transglutaminase (4.Smethurst P.A. Griffin M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Ca2+ and GTP induce opposite conformational changes in the protein tertiary structure, therefore suggesting that the mechanism by which tTGase activity is inhibited by GTP/GDP is essentially due to a protein conformational change that obscures access to the transglutaminase active site (5.Di Venere A. Rossi A. De Matteis F. Rosato N. Agro A.F. Mei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3915-3921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). More recent work has also suggested that a non-proline cis peptide bond close to the active-site cysteine (Cys277) may play a role in the conformational changes linked to the binding of Ca2+ and/or substrate during activation of the enzyme (6.Weiss M.S. Metzner H.J. Hilgenfeld R.

Physiol. 1991; 149: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although tTGase was originally thought to be an intracellular enzyme, accumulating evidence indicates that the enzyme is externalized and capable of cross-linking a wide range of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which is thought to be important in ECM deposition/stabilization and the cell attachment and spreading of a number of different cell types (12.Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 13.Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). However, the link between ECM cross-linking and the role of the enzyme in cell attachment and spreading is still not fully understood. Also unknown is the mechanism of secretion of the enzyme from cells because tTGase does not possess a leader sequence, and there is no evidence of its glycosylation (1.Folk J.E. Finlayson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1977; 31: 1-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). It is therefore unlikely that the enzyme follows the classical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi secretion route. Despite this observation, evidence for the presence of tTGase in the ECM and on the surface of different cell types is now increasing (12.Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 13.Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M. J.

Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been recently described that tTGase mediates cell adhesion and spreading by a mechanism that is independent of its catalytic activity (20.Isobe T. Takahashi H. Ueki S. Takagi J. Saito Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 876-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mechanism proposed suggests that tTGase mediates the interaction of integrins with fibronectin, thereby acting as an integrin-associated co-receptor (15.Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The results from the latter study suggested that complexes of tTGase with integrins are formed inside the cell during biosynthesis, leading to its accumulation on the surface at sites of focal adhesion points (15.Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that in cells undergoing attachment and spreading, the enzyme is co-distributed with adhesion site markers, suggesting that these processes may coincide with the externalization of the enzyme (21.Gaudry C.A. Verderio E. Jones R.A. Smith C. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). tTGase has a high affinity binding site for fibronectin that is localized to the first seven N-terminal amino acids (22.Jeong J.M. Murthy S.N. Radek J.T. Lorand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5654-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); and this binding is independent of its cross-linking activity. The deletion of this N-terminal sequence from the tTGase gene abolishes binding of the enzyme to fibronectin and prevents its cell-surface localization, suggesting that secretion of tTGase from the cells could be associated with the assembly of fibronectin fibrils (23.Gaudry C.A. Verderio E. Aeschlimann D. Cox A. Smith C. Griffin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30707-30714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Other proteins lacking the classical signal sequence but efficiently secreted from the cells have been described to cross the membrane by a novel secretion pathway (24.Jackson A. Tarantini F.

Because tTGase is involved in both cell attachment and spreading and, through its cross-linking activity, in wound healing and tissue fibrosis (7.Bowness J.M. Henteleff H. Dolynchuk K.N. Connect. Tissue Res. 1987; 16: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8.Bowness J.M. Tarr A.H. Wong T. Biochim. Biophys.

Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2146-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not unreasonable to assume that it might also be involved in cell migration, a process that is important to a number of cellular events, including embryogenesis, tissue repair, and tumor invasion. To explore this, we have used 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with a number of different tTGase constructs expressing the catalytically active or inactive forms of tTGase. We show that tTGase can regulate migration and that this novel function is independent of its cross-linking activity. We also demonstrate that mutation of the active-site cysteine prevents the enzyme from being deposited into the ECM and that mutation of Tyr274 to Ala, thought to providecis rather than the preferred trans peptide bond conformation, also leads to loss of tTGase activity and of enzyme secretion. We therefore conclude that tTGase controls cell motility by a process that does not require its deposition into and cross-linking of the ECM, but by acting as a novel cell-surface binding protein. All general chemicals and tissue culture reagents were obtained from Sigma (Dorset, UK) unless otherwise stated. The C277S mutation was introduced into tTGase cDNA (29.Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 478-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as previously described (30.Mian S. El-Alaoui S. Lawry J. Gentile V. Davies P.J. Griffin M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The resulting mutant tTGase cDNA was inserted into the vector pUHD10.3 (14.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) to generate the expression plasmid pUHD10.3-TG277. The Y274A mutation was introduced into tTGase cDNA using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega, Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Starting with the expression vector pSG5-TG containing the full-length tTGase cDNA (donated by P. J. A. Davies, University of Texas Health Center, Houston, TX), the TAT codon of Tyr274 was mutated to GCT for Ala utilizing the oligonucleotide primer 5′-AAGACCCAGCACTGGCCAGCCTTGACGCGCTGGCA-3′ (antisense orientation), which is complementary to nucleotides 940–974 of tTGase cDNA (29.Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 478-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is mutated at positions 955 and 956 (underlined). The resulting recombinant plasmid encoding mutant tTGase was named pSG5-TG274. The presence of the base changes was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The establishment, by cell transfection, of Swiss 3T3 cell lines expressing catalytically active tTGase under the control of the tetracycline-regulated system (31.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar) has been previously described (14.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Swiss 3T3 cell lines expressing inactive C277S mutant tTGase were generated following the same protocol. Briefly, clone tTA2, stably expressing the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (14.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), was cotransfected with pUHD10.3-TG277and the xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase expression plasmid pUS1000 (donated by P. Sanders, University of Surrey) in the presence of tetracycline in the medium. Clones resistant to selection medium for the salvage enzyme xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase were analyzed for their capacity to overexpress tTGase antigen by standard Western blotting of cell homogenates using anti-tTGase monoclonal antibody Cub7402 (Neomarkers). Transfection of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with wild-type and inactive Y274A mutant tTGases was achieved by cotransfecting 0.5 × 106 cells with 4.5 μg of plasmid vector pSG5-TG274 and 0.5 μg of selection vector pSV2neo using the liposome-based transfection reagent ESCORT™ (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol. Clones resistant to 800 μg/ml active G418 (Geneticin, Calbiochem) were screened for overexpression of tTGase by Western blotting as described below. Cell lines of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts expressing catalytically active tTGase (clone TG3) (14.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or inactive C277S mutant tTGase (clone TGI19) in a tetracycline-regulated manner were cultured as described (14.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cell lines were continuously cultured in the presence of tetracycline (2 μg/ml) in the medium. Under this condition, they expressed only low levels of endogenous tTGase. To induce maximum expression of transfected tTGase cDNA, cells were cultured in the absence of tetracycline for 72 h. Cell lines of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (clones TG1, TG16, TGY274A1, TGY274A2, neo1, and neo3) expressing active or inactive Y274A mutant tTGase or the selection marker for G418 resistance, under the control of a non-inducible promoter, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml G418. The cell migration assay used was a modification of the technique described by Akiyama et al.(32.Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Low-melting-point agarose (0.2% (w/v) final concentration), maintained just above 38 °C, was added to a suspension of cells (3.3 × 107 cells/ml) in bicarbonate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (buffered with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Droplets (0.5 μl) of the cell/agarose mixture were seeded in the center of the fibronectin (15 μg/ml)-coated wells of a 96-well plate. After the agarose was allowed to set for 7 min at +4 °C, 100 μl of the growth medium was added to each well. In some cases, the growth medium was supplemented with anti-tTGase antibody or tTGase inhibitors. Cells were left to migrate for 48 h and then fixed and stained with 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet in 70% (w/v) ethanol as described below. The area of outwardly migrating cells was measured using an Optimas 5.2 image analysis system (DataCell Ltd., Yately, UK). Cell attachment was evaluated as previously described (13.Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of a cell suspension (5 × 105 cells/ml) was seeded in a 96-well plate coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin, incubated in serum-free medium, and allowed to attach for 30 min. After this, the cells were gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and attached cells were fixed and stained by addition of 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet in 70% (v/v) ethanol at 100 μl/well. Following three washes with PBS to remove nonspecific staining, cells were solubilized by adding 30% (v/v) acetic acid at 100 μl/well. The absorbance of the solubilized cell mixture was read at 540 nm in a SpectraFluor plate reader (Tecan). The activity of tTGase in cell homogenates was measured by the incorporation of14C-labeled putrescine (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) into N,N′-dimethylcasein as previously described by Lorand et al. (33.Lorand L. Campbell-Wilkes L.K. Cooperstein L. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 50: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). One unit of tTGase activity equals 1 nmol of putrescine incorporated per h. The activity of tTGase associated with the extracellular surface of live cells in culture was measured by the incorporation of biotinylated cadaverine into deoxycholate-insoluble fibronectin using an assay described in detail by Jones et al. (13.Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of tTGase in cell homogenates, after cell lysis in ice-cold buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonication, cell homogenates were mixed with 2× Laemmli loading buffer (34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and boiled for 5 min at 100 °C, and then proteins were resolved as described below. For separation of membrane and cytosolic fractions, cell homogenates were first fractionated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at +4 °C. The precipitated pellets were washed once with the cell lysis buffer and centrifuged as described above. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions according to Laemmli (34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), and tTGase was detected by Western blotting using anti-tTGase monoclonal antibody Cub7402 and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) after incubation with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate. For direct comparison of cell homogenates or subcellular fractions, equal amounts of protein were loaded onto the gels prior to fractionation. To detect tTGase secreted into the growth medium, confluent cells were grown in serum-free AIMV culture medium (Gibco) for 8 h. The medium was then collected and centrifuged to remove any floating cells. Proteins from the cell growth medium were precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% (w/v), followed by centrifugation. The protein pellet was washed once with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid followed by ethanol/acetone (1:1) and acetone, dried, and resuspended in Laemmli buffer (34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The presence of tTGase in the protein pellet was detected by Western blotting as outlined above. Alternatively, the cell growth medium was lyophilized, reconstituted in one-tenth of the initial volume, and analyzed for tTGase antigen by a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method according to Achyuthan et al. (35.Achyuthan K.E. Goodell R.J. Kennedye J.R. Lee K.N. Henley A. Stiefer J.R. Birckbichler P.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as described below. The protein concentration was determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (36.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of extracellular tTGase was performed using the modified ELISA technique described previously (19.Verderio E. Gaudry C. Gross S. Smith C. Downes S. Griffin M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 104cells/well were seeded in a 96-well plate 1 day prior to the assay. Anti-tTGase antibody Cub7402 was diluted 1:1000 in the cell growth medium and added directly to cells in live culture. After a 3-h incubation, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in methanol. The antigen-antibody complex was revealed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Bound horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by addition of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate. Color development was stopped with 2.5 n H2SO4, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm in a plate reader. For protein quantification, identical cell numbers were grown in parallel and solubilized in 0.1% (w/v) deoxycholate. Proteins were precipitated in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method (37.Brown R.E. Jarvis K.L. Hyland K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The measured tTGase protein was then expressed asA 450 nm/1.0 mg of deoxycholate-soluble protein. For detection of total tTGase, a modification of the method of Achyuthan et al. (35.Achyuthan K.E. Goodell R.J. Kennedye J.R. Lee K.N. Henley A. Stiefer J.R. Birckbichler P.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was used. Cell homogenates were added to the fibronectin-coated wells of a 96-well plate, and the binding of tTGase to fibronectin was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were then blocked with blocking buffer (5% (w/v) dried skimmed milk in PBS, pH 7.4) and incubated with Cub7402 (diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer) was carried out for 2 h at room temperature. Bound horseradish peroxidase activity was measured as described above. The amount of tTGase protein was expressed as A 450 nm/1.0 mg of total protein. Detection of extracellular tTGase was done as previously described (14.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) by staining cells in culture. Immunolabeling of tTGase was carried out using anti-tTGase primary monoclonal antibody Cub7402 and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Staining was visualized by confocal fluorescent microscopy using a Leica TCSNT confocal laser microscope system (Leica Laserechnik, Heidelberg, Germany). For flow cytometry, transfected Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were detached from tissue culture dishes with 2 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4. Live non-permeabilized cells in suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml) were stained for cell-surface tTGase with anti-tTGase antibody Cub7402 (3 μg/ml) in serum-free medium for 3 h at +4 °C. After washing cells with serum-free medium and incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, cells were washed once more, fixed in 0.5% (v/v) formaldehyde, and analyzed with a Dako Galaxy flow cytometer. Values represent the mean fluorescence intensity. Student's t test was used to compare data. When p was <0.05, the difference between sets of data was considered to be statistically different. The amount of tTGase antigen expressed in cell homogenates of induced transfected cells was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The Western blot shown in Fig. 1 A shows clear induction of both forms of the enzyme in TG3− and TGI19−. Densitometric analysis indicated that expression of clone TG3 increased between 7- and 10-fold, as previously documented (14.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For the inactive C277S mutant, quantitation of induction by densitometry was not possible because of the low endogenous background. Measurement of antigen by a modified ELISA that first involves attachment of the enzyme to a fibronectin-coated plate indicated a 2–3-fold induction for clone TG3 and a 4–5-fold increase for clone TG19. Overexpression of the active form of the enzyme in clone TG3 led to an increase in total tTGase activity in cell homogenates (∼12-fold) as measured by the [14C]putrescine incorporation assay (Fig. 1 C) and an increase in cell surface-related extracellular activity (∼3–4-fold) as measured by the cell-mediated incorporation of biotinylated cadaverine into fibronectin (Fig. 1 D) (14.Verderio E. Nicholas B. Gross S. Griffin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As expected, no tTGase activity was observed in clone TGI19 when induced to overexpress the inactive form of the enzyme (Fig. 1,C and D). By the agarose droplet method (Fig. 2 A), the transfected clone TG3 overexpressing tTGase showed a decreased rate of cell migration on fibronectin compared with the non-induced control (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that increased expression of tTGase affects cell motility. A reduced rate of migration was also observed in clone TGI19 induced to overexpress inactive tTGase compared with the non-induced cells (Fig. 2 B), indicating that cell motility is not dependent on the cross-linking a"
https://openalex.org/W1983210070,"We have previously identified the opium alkaloid noscapine as a microtubule interacting agent that binds stoichiometrically to tubulin and alters its conformation. Here we show that, unlike many other microtubule inhibitors, noscapine does not significantly promote or inhibit microtubule polymerization. Instead, it alters the steady-state dynamics of microtubule assembly, primarily by increasing the amount of time that the microtubules spend in an attenuated (pause) state. Further studies reveal that even at high concentrations, noscapine does not alter the tubulin polymer/monomer ratio in HeLa cells. Cells treated with noscapine arrest at mitosis with nearly normal bipolar spindles. Strikingly, although most of the chromosomes in these cells are aligned at the metaphase plate, the rest remain near the spindle poles, both of which exhibit loss of tension across kinetochore pairs. Furthermore, levels of the spindle checkpoint proteins Mad2, Bub1, and BubR1 decrease by 138-, 3.7-, and 3.9-fold, respectively, at the kinetochore region upon chromosome alignment. Our results thus suggest that an exquisite control of microtubule dynamics is required for kinetochore tension generation and chromosome alignment during mitosis. Our data also support the idea that Mad2 and Bub1/BubR1 respond to kinetochore-microtubule attachment and/or tension to different degrees. We have previously identified the opium alkaloid noscapine as a microtubule interacting agent that binds stoichiometrically to tubulin and alters its conformation. Here we show that, unlike many other microtubule inhibitors, noscapine does not significantly promote or inhibit microtubule polymerization. Instead, it alters the steady-state dynamics of microtubule assembly, primarily by increasing the amount of time that the microtubules spend in an attenuated (pause) state. Further studies reveal that even at high concentrations, noscapine does not alter the tubulin polymer/monomer ratio in HeLa cells.

Our data also support the idea that Mad2 and Bub1/BubR1 respond to kinetochore-microtubule attachment and/or tension to different degrees. Microtubules are cytoskeletal structures assembled from α/β-tubulin heterodimers that play an essential role in many cellular processes, such as cell motility, organelle transport, maintenance of cell polarity, and cell division (1.Nogales E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 277-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Microtubules are intrinsically dynamic, in that they alternate abruptly and stochastically between periods of growth and shortening, a phenomenon termed “dynamic instability” (2.Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar, 3.Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). A second dynamic behavior of microtubules, termed “treadmilling,” results from the net growth of microtubules at one end and net shortening at the other end (4.Margolis R.L. Wilson L. Cell. 1978; 13: 1-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Several parameters have been used to characterize the dynamics of microtubule assembly: growth rate, shortening rate, frequency of transition from growth to shortening (catastrophe frequency (5.Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar)), frequency of transition from shortening to growth or an attenuated (pause) state (rescue frequency (5.Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar)), and the duration of the attenuated state when neither microtubule growth nor shortening can be detected (6.Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 267-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Overall microtubule dynamics due to dynamic instability is best described as “dynamicity,” which measures the sum of visually detectable tubulin dimer exchange per unit time at the ends of microtubules.These dynamic properties are crucial for microtubules to carry out many of their cellular functions such as reorientation of the microtubule network when cells undergo migration or morphological changes and the dramatic microtubule rearrangement at the onset of mitosis (7.Joshi H.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mitotic microtubules are 10–100 times more dynamic than interphase microtubules; they exchange their tubulin with the soluble tubulin pool with half-times of ∼15 s during mitosis as compared with 3 min to several hours in interphase (8.Saxton W.M. Stemple D.L. Leslie R.J. Salmon E.D. Zavortink M. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2175-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 9.Schulze E. Kirschner M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1020-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 10.Pepperkok R. Bre M.H. Davoust J. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3003-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11.Belmont L.D. Hyman A.A. Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1990; 62: 579-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The rapid microtubule dynamics in mitosis is thought to be critical for both the morphogenesis and activities of the bipolar spindle, which directs the alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate and their final segregation into two daughter cells.Many microtubule interacting agents have been very useful in the study of mitosis because they bind to microtubules and disrupt their normal activities. One group of agents, such as paclitaxel, promotes microtubule polymerization at high concentrations and bundles the resulting stable microtubules. Another group, including colchicine, nocodazole, and vinblastine, inhibits microtubule polymerization at high concentrations and suppresses microtubule dynamics at low concentrations (6.Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 267-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although these different classes of microtubule inhibitors act differently, they all block cell cycle progression at prometaphase, thus preventing onset of the metaphase-anaphase transition. It is generally believed that these agents cause spindle damage or suppress spindle dynamics, consequently activating the spindle checkpoint to block cells at mitosis (6.Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 267-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12.Amon A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In its role as a molecular safeguard, the spindle checkpoint might be able to sense even minor errors in spindle function. Consequently, drugs that alter spindle dynamics without changing microtubule polymer mass would be powerful tools for studying the roles of microtubule dynamics in mitosis and for refining the mechanisms for spindle checkpoint activation.We have previously found that the opium alkaloid noscapine binds stoichiometrically to tubulin, alters the conformation of tubulin, and arrests mammalian cells at mitosis without causing gross deformations of cellular microtubules (13.Ye K. Ke Y. Keshava N. Shanks J. Kapp J.A. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that noscapine suppresses the steady-state dynamics of microtubule assembly without significantly affecting microtubule polymerization in vitro or in tissue culture cells even at high concentrations. Our data also show clearly that minor alteration of microtubule dynamics by noscapine causes failure of chromosome congression and loss of tension across sister kinetochores and activates the spindle checkpoint. These findings not only provide important insight into the mechanism by which noscapine blocks mitotic progression but also shed light on the molecular basis of how the kinetochore tension is generated and how the spindle checkpoint proteins respond to microtubule attachment and/or tension.DISCUSSIONNoscapine is a novel microtubule interacting agent that arrests mitosis in dividing mammalian cells (13.Ye K. Ke Y. Keshava N. Shanks J. Kapp J.A. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that noscapine did not significantly affect the in vitroassembly of tubulin into microtubules even at concentrations as high as 100 μm. At such a high concentration, many other known microtubule inhibitors (e.g. paclitaxel, nocodazole, colchicine, vinblastine, etc.) strongly promote or inhibit microtubule assembly (6.Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 267-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 42.Dustin P. Microtubules. Springer-Verlag, New York1984Crossref Google Scholar). Our data further demonstrated that noscapine, as predicted from the in vitro microtubule behavior, did not significantly change the tubulin polymer/monomer ratios in HeLa cells. The minor effect of noscapine on microtubule assembly was also predicted by the nature of its alteration of microtubule dynamics at steady state in vitro. Microtubule growing and shortening rates and their extents were both slightly inhibited by noscapine, and the catastrophe frequency was reduced, resulting in an increased attenuated phase. However, at the concentrations used for the above studies, noscapine efficiently blocked cells in mitosis. Thus, these findings clearly show that noscapine interacts with microtubules in a manner distinct from many other microtubule drugs. These results also support the hypothesis that the mechanisms by which anti-microtubule drugs inhibit cell division and proliferation might lie in the suppression of spindle microtubule dynamics (43.Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 569-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Chemical compounds that suppress spindle dynamics without increasing or decreasing microtubule polymer mass have been very powerful agents in the direct testing of the roles of microtubule dynamics in mitosis (6.Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 267-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because these drugs affect microtubule assembly and dynamics through diverse mechanisms, their use and action in the study of mitosis collectively might provide invaluable information about the role that microtubules play in the progression of mitosis. In this study we have explored the use of noscapine in analyzing mitosis. The finding that noscapine causes chromosome congression failure is very intriguing. It is possible that suppression of microtubule dynamics by noscapine might affect the chromosome-capturing ability of microtubules, which is essential for chromosome congression and subsequent alignment at the metaphase equator. Alternatively, the interaction of noscapine with microtubules might influence the interaction of microtubules with motor molecules that is required for chromosome movement to the equatorial center (44.Funabiki H. Murray A.W. Cell. 2000; 102: 411-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 45.Antonio C. Ferby I. Wilhelm H. Jones M. Karsenti E. Nebreda A.R. Vernos I. Cell. 2000; 102: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that chromosome congression is not a smooth, continuous movement of chromosomes from the poles to the equatorial plate, but rather it is a nonlinear journey involving frequent oscillations both toward and away from the poles (32.Cassimeris L. Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Rieder C.L. Davison E.A. Jensen L.C. Cassimeris L. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 47.Wise D. Cassimeris L. Rieder C.L. Wadsworth P. Salmon E.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 18: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 48.Ault J.G. DeMarco A.J. Salmon E.D. Rieder C.L. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 701-710PubMed Google Scholar). Such movements would necessarily require frequent transitions between microtubule growth and shortening. Thus, the most likely explanation is that the inhibition of the microtubule catastrophe frequency by noscapine and the increase in the fraction of time that the microtubules remain in the attenuated state delay or prevent chromosome congression.Physical tension across kinetochore pairs, another property closely related to the dynamic instability of microtubules, is also thought to be critical for chromosome movement during mitosis. Our results demonstrate that alteration of microtubule dynamics by noscapine does not cause major changes in spindle morphology, and yet the altered dynamics results in the loss of kinetochore tension, as revealed by the reduction of sister kinetochore distance. In addition, our preliminary electron microscopic analysis shows that noscapine treatment also leads to reduction in the number of kinetochore microtubules of the aligned chromosomes.2 Thus, the loss of tension by noscapine treatment can be attributed not only to the suppression of microtubule dynamics but also to fewer microtubules attached per kinetochore. In this study, we found that tension on the kinetochores of chromosomes that failed to align at the equatorial mid-plate but rather remained near the spindle poles was even less than that of chromosomes aligned at the metaphase equator. This is understandable because most of the unaligned chromosomes might be mono-oriented without attaching to the opposite spindle pole, whereas those that are aligned might associate with microtubules from the two poles. These results are also consistent with results obtained with substoichiometric nanomolar concentration of vinblastine, which also dampens spindle microtubule dynamics without perturbing bipolar spindle association with kinetochores (35.Shelby R.D. Hahn K.M. Sullivan K.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 36.Skoufias D.A. Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Wilson L. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4492-4497Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).The goal of the cell division cycle is to produce two genetically identical cells from one. To ensure fidelity in the transmission of genetic information, the cell must be able to detect errors before chromosome segregation at anaphase. This is achieved by the spindle checkpoint, which prevents the onset of anaphase until all of the chromosomes are correctly attached by spindle microtubules and proper tension is applied to the chromosomes (33.Nicklas R.B. Science. 1997; 275: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 34.Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 310-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Our data show that the spindle checkpoint proteins Mad2, Bub1, and BubR1 all respond, yet to different degrees, to kinetochore-microtubule attachment and/or tension. It will be of great importance to investigate further how the attachment and/or tension signal the spindle checkpoint machinery as well as how various checkpoint proteins participate in these processes. Microtubules are cytoskeletal structures assembled from α/β-tubulin heterodimers that play an essential role in many cellular processes, such as cell motility, organelle transport, maintenance of cell polarity, and cell division (1.Nogales E.

In this study we have explored the use of noscapine in analyzing mitosis. The finding that noscapine causes chromosome congression failure is very intriguing. It is possible that suppression of microtubule dynamics by noscapine might affect the chromosome-capturing ability of microtubules, which is essential for chromosome congression and subsequent alignment at the metaphase equator. Alternatively, the interaction of noscapine with microtubules might influence the interaction of microtubules with motor molecules that is required for chromosome movement to the equatorial center (44.Funabiki H. Murray A.W. Cell. 2000; 102: 411-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 45.Antonio C. Ferby I. Wilhelm H. Jones M. Karsenti E. Nebreda A.R. Vernos I. Cell. 2000; 102: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that chromosome congression is not a smooth, continuous movement of chromosomes from the poles to the equatorial plate, but rather it is a nonlinear journey involving frequent oscillations both toward and away from the poles (32.Cassimeris L. Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Rieder C.L. Davison E.A. Jensen L.C. Cassimeris L. Salmon E.D. J.

Such movements would necessarily require frequent transitions between microtubule growth and shortening. Thus, the most likely explanation is that the inhibition of the microtubule catastrophe frequency by noscapine and the increase in the fraction of time that the microtubules remain in the attenuated state delay or prevent chromosome congression. Physical tension across kinetochore pairs, another property closely related to the dynamic instability of microtubules, is also thought to be critical for chromosome movement during mitosis. Our results demonstrate that alteration of microtubule dynamics by noscapine does not cause major changes in spindle morphology, and yet the altered dynamics results in the loss of kinetochore tension, as revealed by the reduction of sister kinetochore distance. In addition, our preliminary electron microscopic analysis shows that noscapine treatment also leads to reduction in the number of kinetochore microtubules of the aligned chromosomes.2 Thus, the loss of tension by noscapine treatment can be attributed not only to the suppression of microtubule dynamics but also to fewer microtubules attached per kinetochore. In this study, we found that tension on the kinetochores of chromosomes that failed to align at the equatorial mid-plate but rather remained near the spindle poles was even less than that of chromosomes aligned at the metaphase equator. This is understandable because most of the unaligned chromosomes might be mono-oriented without attaching to the opposite spindle pole, whereas those that are aligned might associate with microtubules from the two poles. These results are also consistent with results obtained with substoichiometric nanomolar concentration of vinblastine, which also dampens spindle microtubule dynamics without perturbing bipolar spindle association with kinetochores (35.Shelby R.D.

To ensure fidelity in the transmission of genetic information, the cell must be able to detect errors before chromosome segregation at anaphase. This is achieved by the spindle checkpoint, which prevents the onset of anaphase until all of the chromosomes are correctly attached by spindle microtubules and proper tension is applied to the chromosomes (33.Nicklas R.B. Science. 1997; 275: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 34.Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D.

Our data show that the spindle checkpoint proteins Mad2, Bub1, and BubR1 all respond, yet to different degrees, to kinetochore-microtubule attachment and/or tension. It will be of great importance to investigate further how the attachment and/or tension signal the spindle checkpoint machinery as well as how various checkpoint proteins participate in these processes.

Moreover, these two forms of TESP5 were selectively included into Triton X-100-insoluble microdomains, lipid rafts, of the sperm membranes.

Of these events, the acrosome reaction is a fusion between the outer acrosomal and plasma membranes at the anterior region of sperm head. Consequently, the acrosomal components are released and interact with the ZP. The sperm penetration of the ZP is believed to require both sperm motility and enzymatic hydrolysis by acrosomal protease(s) (1.Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction.

The role of acrosin in fertilization has long been considered to participate in the limited proteolysis of ZP, which enables sperm to penetrate the ZP. However, our previous work (8.Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using acrosin-deficient mutant mice conclusively showed that acrosin is not essential both for the sperm penetration of the egg ZP and for fertilization. The deficiency of acrosin causes a delay in the dispersal of acrosomal proteins during the acrosome reaction (9.Yamagata K. Murayama K. Okabe M. Toshimori K. Nakanishi T. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. J.

It has been reported that various trypsin inhibitors prevent sperm from penetrating the ZP (10.Stambaugh R. Brackett B.G. Mastroianni L. Biol.

Since p-aminobenzamidine (pAB), a competitive inhibitor for trypsin-like serine proteases, effectively blocks the penetration of acrosin-deficient mouse sperm through the ZP (14.Yamagata K.

Genet. 1999; 25: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that two gelatin-hydrolyzing proteins with sizes of 42 and 41 kDa are present in the extracts of wild-type mouse sperm, whereas acrosin-deficient mouse sperm contain the 42-kDa protein and apparently lack the 41-kDa protein. The inhibition profiles toward serine protease inhibitors indicate that these two gelatin-hydrolyzing proteins belong to the superfamily of trypsin-like serine proteases (14.Yamagata K. Murayama K. Kohno N. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Zygote. 1998; 6: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the 42-kDa protease is a candidate enzyme involved in the sperm penetration of egg ZP at least in mouse. As described above, only a 42-kDa serine protease exhibiting gelatin-hydrolyzing activity is found in sperm extracts from wild-type and acrosin-deficient mice (8.Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Yamagata K. Murayama K. Kohno N. Kashiwabara S. Baba T.

Production of the active 42- and 41-kDa proteases is accelerated by incubation of the sperm extracts at pH 8.5, and by addition of exogenous pancreatic trypsin to the extracts. The gelatin-hydrolyzing activity of the 42-kDa protease in the acrosin-deficient mouse remains constant during the pH 8.5 incubation (8.Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Yamagata K. Murayama K. Kohno N. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Zygote. 1998; 6: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the active 41-kDa protease is not found in the sperm extracts without addition of exogenous trypsin (15.Yamagata K. Honda A. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These data imply that the 42-kDa protease as well as acrosin may be present in acrosome-intact sperm as an enzymatically inactive pro-protein (zymogen), a part of which is already converted into the active enzyme by a processing enzyme(s) with a trypsin-like cleavage specificity, including acrosin, and/or by autoactivation (14.Yamagata K. Murayama K. Kohno N. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Zygote. 1998; 6: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15.Yamagata K. Honda A. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the zymogens of the 42- and 41-kDa proteases are essentially different molecules, or that the 41-kDa protease is produced from the 42-kDa protease by proteolytic processing. To prove these possibilities, the molecular basis of the pro- and mature forms of the 42-kDa serine protease needs to be clarified. cDNA clones encoding four different serine proteases, TESP1 (testicular serine protease 1), TESP2, TESP3, and TESP4, have been identified as candidates for 42-kDa gelatin-hydrolyzing enzyme in mouse sperm (16.Kohno N. Yamagata K. Yamada S. Kashiwabara S. Sakai Y. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17.Ohmura K. Kohno N. Kobayashi Y. Yamagata K. Sato S. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29426-29432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although TESP1, TESP2, and TESP4 are all present in the acrosome of mouse sperm, Western blot analysis of sperm protein extracts indicates that the three proteases differ from the 42-kDa gelatin-hydrolyzing enzyme in molecular size. In addition, TESP3 is localized solely in spermatogenic cells of the testis when antibody raised against the N-terminal 6-residue peptide of TESP3 is used. 2S. Sato and T. Baba, unpublished data.2S. Sato and T. Baba, unpublished data. These data imply that none of the four TESPs is identical to the 42-kDa gelatin-hydrolyzing protease. Thus, further experiments are required to elucidate the mechanism of sperm penetration through the ZP in mouse. In this study, we have isolated genomic clones encoding a testicular serine protease, termed TESP5, from a mouse genomic DNA library. The nucleotide sequence of the TESP5 gene demonstrates the identity of this gene with the testisin (18.Scarman A.L. Hooper J.D. Boucaut K.J. Sit M.L. Webb G.C. Normyle J.F. Antalis T.M. Eur. J.

Commun. 1999; 266: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) genes previously reported. TESP5/testisin/esp-1 is localized on the sperm membrane probably as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, and corresponds to the 42- and 41-kDa gelatin-hydrolyzing enzymes. On the basis of biochemical data regarding TESP5, a possible role of TESP5 in the sperm/egg interaction is discussed.

Experimental animals, ICR mice, Wistar rats, and New Zealand White rabbits, were obtained from Japan SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). RT-PCR was carried out using a 3′-Full RACE kit (Takara Shuzo, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total cellular RNAs of various tissues and male germ cells by AMV RT XL using an oligo (dT)-3sites adaptor primer. PCR was carried out in a mixture (25 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1 μmeach of the primers, the template DNA, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Wako, Osaka, Japan). The PCR products were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and then introduced into a pUC19 vector. An expressed sequence tag (EST) clone, AA144961, was amplified from a mouse testis cDNA library by PCR using T6-1, 5′-CCTGCGGTCACAGGACCATCC-3′, and T6-2, 5′-ACAGCTTCAGCAGGGCTATGTCA-3′, as primers. The DNA fragment amplified was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences), and used as a probe to screen ∼9.0 × 105 plaques from a mouse 129/SvJ genomic DNA library in λFIXII (Stratagene), as described previously (23.Baba T.

The blots were probed by32P-labeled DNA fragments, and analyzed by a BAS-1800II Bio-Image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo). To remove poly(A) tails of mRNAs, RNase H digestion of total RNAs, which had been annealed with oligo(dT)15, was carried out as described (24.Kashiwabara S. Zhuang T. Yamagata K. Noguchi J. Fukamizu A. Baba T. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The RNase H-digested RNA samples were subjected to Northern blot analysis, as mentioned above. Mouse testes were homogenized in 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine/HCl, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (1 μg/ml) using a Teflon-glass homogenizer at 900 rpm (5 strokes/min). The homogenate was centrifuged in a Tomy SRX-201 centrifuge using a TA-24BH rotor (Tokyo, Japan) at 19,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant solution was further centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was used as “soluble protein extracts.” The precipitate obtained by first centrifugation was extracted in PBS containing 1% SDS at room temperature for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used as “insoluble protein extracts.” Fresh cauda epididymal sperm in a modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (TYH medium, see Ref. 8.Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S.

The dispersed sperm suspension was centrifuged in an Eppendorf 5415D centrifuge at 800 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed, extracted in 1 mm HCl containing 1% SDS or 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h, and centrifuged in the above Tomy centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Subcellular components of cauda epididymal sperm were prepared as described previously (15.Yamagata K. Honda A. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,25.Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Sperm were suspended in the TYH medium containing calcium ionophore A23187 (10 μg/ml), incubated for 60 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air, and centrifuged twice in an Eppendorf 5415D centrifuge at 800 × g for 10 min to remove sperm. The supernatant was further separated into the precipitate and supernatant fractions by centrifugation in a Beckman L8-70M ultracentrifuge using an SW41 rotor at 100,000 ×g for 90 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed with PBS, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and resuspended in PBS (Fraction A). The supernatant solution after first ultracentrifugation was dialyzed against PBS, and centrifuged in the above Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 × g for 10 min (Fraction B). Fractions A and B were used as samples enriched by plasma and outer-acrosomal membranes, and soluble proteins released by theA23187-induced acrosome reaction, including acrosomal components, respectively. Acrosome-reacted sperm were washed three times with PBS, and sonicated as described (25.Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To the 2.5-ml suspension an equal volume of 1.8 m sucrose was added, and the mixture was put onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient solution containing 2.5 ml each of 2.20 and 2.05 m sucrose, and centrifuged in the above Beckman L8-70M ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. Fractions C, D, and E corresponding to acrosome-reacted sperm heads, tails, and cytoplasmic droplets formed a pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube, a band at the middle of the 2.05 m sucrose layer, and a band at the interface between the 0.9 and 2.05 m sucrose layers, respectively. Each of Fractions D and E was precipitated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The purities of these fractions were microscopically more than 95%. The samples were suspended in PBS, mixed with an SDS sample buffer, and then subjected to Western blot analysis. Low density membrane fractions insoluble in Triton X-100 were prepared from cauda epididymal sperm by the established method (26.Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Sperm (3.0 × 108 sperm/ml) were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA (TNE) containing 75 units/ml aprotinin and 1% Triton X-100, and put on ice for 20 min. The suspension was homogenized by a Dounce homogenizer (5 strokes), and centrifuged in an Eppendorf 5415D centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant solution was brought to 40% sucrose using 80% sucrose in TNE, placed at the bottom of a Beckman Ultra Clear centrifuge tube, and overlaid with 30% sucrose (6 ml) and 5% sucrose (3.5 ml) in TNE. After centrifugation in a Beckman L8-70M ultracentrifuge using an SW41 rotor at 200,000 × g for 18 h, fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE in the presence of 0.1% gelatin. An 871-bp DNA fragment encoding the pro- and catalytic domains of TESP5 was PCR-amplified from a mouse testis cDNA library, using MTP4, 5′-TGCGGCCATGGCCTTACA-3′, and MTP5, 5′-AACTCGAGTTAGTCAGGCCTGAGCAGCC-3′, as primers. The PCR product was introduced into a pET-23d vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) at the NcoI and XhoI sites for expression inEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3). A single colony of the transformants was cultured at 37 °C overnight in Luria broth containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin (5 ml, LA) with constant shaking. A portion (3 ml) of the bacterial culture was added to fresh LA (120 ml), and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with shaking. Production of the recombinant proteins was induced by addition of 0.3 ml of 0.1misopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cell growth was continued at 20 °C overnight. E. coli cells were collected by centrifugation in a Tomy RL-131 centrifuge using a TS-7 rotor at 1,500 × g for 10 min, and suspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.25% Tween 20. The suspension was frozen at −80 °C, sonicated, and then centrifuged in a Tomy SRX-201 centrifuge using a TA-24BH rotor at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Recombinant TESP5 was found as an enzymatically inactive protein solely in the precipitate. For production of recombinant TESP5 in a mammalian cell line, HEK293, an expression plasmid carrying the entire protein-coding region in the TESP5 cDNA sequence was constructed by PCR-directed mutagenesis using a set of oligonucleotide primers, MTP2, 5′-TGAATTCACAGGTGTGACGTACAC-3′, and MTP3, 5′-TTGAATTCGAGAGGTGGCCATGGGC-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was introduced into a pCXN2 (27.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar) vector at the EcoRI site. HEK293 cells (4 × 106 cells), which were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air, were electroporated at 500 μF with the expression plasmid (10 μg) in PBS, and viable cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes. After 24 h, cells were treated with trypsin and grown in the above medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 to obtain stable transformants. Recombinant mouse TESP5 (0.5 mg) produced in E. coli was emulsified by sonication in an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco Laboratories), and injected intradermally into female rabbits. Rabbit anti-TESP5 antibody was purified by fractionation with ammonium sulfate (0–40% saturation) followed by immunoaffinity chromatography on a column of Sepharose 4B that had been substituted with the recombinant protein by the cyanogen bromide procedure (28.Fuller S.A.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 2% skim milk, the blots were incubated with affinity-purified anti-TESP5 antibody at room temperature for 2 h, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) for 1 h. The immunoreactive proteins were detected by an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). To detect proteins exhibiting gelatin-hydrolyzing activities, SDS-PAGE in the presence of 0.1% gelatin was carried out as described previously (15.Yamagata K. Honda A. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Proteins (0.2 mg) were pre-incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at room temperature for 3 h, lyophilized, dissolved in 8 m urea (120 μl) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% Ampholine (pH 3.5–10), and placed onto polyacrylamide gel strips with an immobilized pH gradient (Immobiline DryStrips) at 20 °C for 10 h. Isoelectric focusing was carried out at 20 °C using an IPGphor instrument (Amersham Biosciences) according to the following program: a linear gradient run at 0 to 500 V for 60 min, 500 to 1,000 V for 60 min, and 1,000 to 8,000 V for 60 min, and a constant run at 8,000 V for 3 h. After electrophoresis, the gel strips were soaked in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, and 1% SDS, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Affinity-purified anti-TESP5 antibody (30 μl) was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 6 μl of protein A immobilized on agarose beads (Pierce). The agarose beads were washed with PBS by centrifugation to remove the unbound antibodies, mixed with sperm proteins (0.2 mg) in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, incubated at 4 °C overnight, and centrifuged. The pellet was washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, dissolved in 8m urea, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Testicular tissues from adult mice were fixed in a solution containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 m lysine hydrochloride, and 2% paraformaldehyde (PLP) at 4 °C for 3 h, snap-frozen, and embedded in a Tissue-Tek™ O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Tokyo). Sections (7 μm) were prepared in a Leica CM3000 cryostat, mounted on silanized glass slides, air-dried at room temperature, and washed with PBS. Each slide for the testicular sections was blocked with 2% normal goat serum in PBS, and incubated with affinity-purified anti-TESP5 antibody in PBS containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, the slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to remove endogenous peroxidase activity, washed with PBS, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The samples on the slides were stained with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen, counterstained with 2.5% methyl green, and viewed under an Olympus BX50 microscope.

We investigated the signaling pathway linking the activation of CYP 2C9 to enhanced endothelial cell proliferation. Overexpression of CYP 2C9 in cultured human endothelial cells markedly increased proliferation. This effect was paralleled by an up-regulation of the G1 phase regulatory protein, cyclin D1. The specific CYP 2C9 inhibitor, sulfaphenazole, prevented both the enhanced cell proliferation and up-regulation of cyclin D1. CYP 2C9 overexpression also decreased the activity of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Coexpression of wild type JNK with CYP 2C9 attenuated the CYP 2C9-induced increase in cyclin D1 expression and abolished the CYP 2C9-induced proliferation response. In contrast, cotransfecting dominant negative JNK with CYP 2C9 restored the CYP 2C9-mediated up-regulation of cyclin D1 and proliferation. The inactivation of JNK is linked to its dephosphorylation by dual specificity mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatases (MKPs). Overexpression of CYP 2C9 significantly increased the expression of MKP-1, as did incubation with 11,12-EET. These data demonstrate that the mitogenic effect of CYP 2C9 is due to the generation of EETs, which promote the MKP-1-mediated dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK, effects ultimately culminating in the expression of cyclin D1 and endothelial cell proliferation.

Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Initially, CYP-derived EETs were described to hyperpolarize and relax vascular smooth muscle cells as a consequence of the activation of large conductance Ca2+-dependent K+channels (BKCa+) (2Campbell W.B. Gebremedhin D. Pratt P.F. Harder D.R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 3Li P.L. Zou A.P. Campbell W.B.

However, several more recently reported cellular actions of EETs cannot be attributed to the activation of BKCa+, suggesting that EETs are more than just vasodilators. Indeed, EETs are reported to stimulate the ADP-ribosylation of G-proteins (5Li P.L. Campbell W.B. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) as well as activate intracellular protein kinases including tyrosine kinases, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and protein kinase B (protein kinase B/Akt) (6Hoebel B.G.

Hypertension. 2000; 36: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); however, whereas expression of CYP 2J appears to be constitutive, stimuli such as pulsatile stretch or Ca2+ antagonists markedly enhance the expression of CYP 2C (11Fisslthaler B.

The resulting CYP 2C-induced changes in vascular function/homeostasis cannot only be attributed to the synthesis of EETs because this enzyme also generates biologically relevant amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (14Fleming I. Michaelis U.R. Bredenkotter D. Fisslthaler B. Dehghani F. Brandes R.P. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that EETs activate MAP kinases and enhance endothelial cell growth (7Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Michaelis U.R. Kiss L. Popp R. Busse R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to determine the cellular events linking CYP 2C with endothelial cell proliferation. We report here that the mitogenic effect of CYP 2C9 can be attributed to the generation of EETs, induction of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), and inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, effects ultimately culminating in the increased expression of cyclin D1 and endothelial cell proliferation. 11,12-EET was purchased fromBiomol (Hamburg, Germany) or Cayman Chemical (Massy, France). The cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, protein A-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences, and protein G-Sepharose was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (Berlin, Germany). Sulfaphenazole and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Cell Systems/Clonetics (Solingen, Germany) and cultured in endothelial basal medium (Cell Systems/Clonetics) supplemented with hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), bovine brain extract (3 μg/ml), penicillin (50 μg/ml), gentamycin (50 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 μg/ml), and 8% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Second passage endothelial cells were used exclusively in this study. HUVEC (50–60% confluent) were serum-starved for 24 h prior to transfection with 2–2.5 μg of plasmids. Plasmids included CYP 2C9 (pcDNA3 CYP 2C9), wild type JNK1 (pcDNA3Flag-JNK1), dominant negative JNK1 (pcDNA3.1Flag-JNK1 APF), wild type p38β (pcDNA3.1Flag-p38β), dominant negative p38β (pcDNA3.1Flag p38β AF), and the control plasmid (pcDNA3.1). Transfection was performed using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Cells were incubated with the DNA-Superfect complexes at 37 °C for 4 h followed by recovery in the presence of 4% fetal calf serum. Transfection efficiency was about 40% as determined using green fluorescent protein, and maximal levels of protein expression were observed between 24 and 48 h. The wild type JNK1 and dominant negative JNK1 expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Roger J. Davis (Worcester, MA), and the wild type and dominant negative p38 constructs were a gift from Dr. Gang Pei (Shanghai, China). To assay proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, quiescent HUVEC were transfected with pcDNA3.1 CYP 2C9, wild type JNK1, a dominant negative JNK1, or combinations thereof. At 24 and 36 h after transfection, the proliferative status of the endothelial cells was determined. Briefly, cells were incubated with BrdUrd (10 μm) for 2 h, and incorporated BrdUrd was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In separate series of experiments, endothelial cells were transfected as described and harvested after 3, 24, and 36 h. Cells were then counted using a cell counter (CASY1, Schärfe System), and protein was extracted for Western blot analysis. To assess JNK activity, endothelial cells were stimulated as described under “Results,” rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmNa2H2P2O7, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The protein extracts were incubated with 4 μl of rabbit anti-JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C and then with 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose. After 1 h at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with Triton lysis buffer and kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min using 2 μg of GST-c-Jun (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) as a substrate, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP (Hartmann Analytik, Braunschweig, Germany) in 30 μl of kinase buffer. The reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%). The incorporation of [32P]phosphate was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning densitometry. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer, left on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Proteins in the resulting supernatant or in the Triton-insoluble pellet were heated with Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE as described (15Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11009-11015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected with antibodies recognizing cyclin D1, JNK1, MKP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-p38, and p38 MAP kinase (Cell Signaling). The CYP 2C9 antibody used was purified by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) from the serum of rabbits immunized with a CYP 2C9 peptide (RRRKLPPGPTPLPIC). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a commercially available kit (Amersham Biosciences). Data are expressed as means ± S.E., and statistical evaluation was performed using Student’s t test for unpaired data, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Bonferroni t test, or ANOVA for repeated measures, where appropriate. Values of p< 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To characterize the role of CYP 2C9 as a putative modulator of endothelial proliferation, BrdUrd incorporation was determined in human umbilical vein endothelial cells 24 and 36 h after transfection with either pcDNA3.1 or CYP 2C9. At 24 h after transfection, CYP 2C9 protein expression was maximal (Fig.1A), and BrdUrd incorporation into endothelial cells was approximately twice that detected in control cells, i.e. cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 and cultured in the presence of 4% fetal calf serum (Fig. 1B). To ensure that the increase in BrdUrd incorporation was indeed mediated by CYP 2C9, endothelial cells were pretreated with the specific CYP 2C9 inhibitor sulfaphenazole (16Mancy A. Dijols S. Poli S. Guengerich P. Mansuy D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16205-16212Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The CYP inhibitor significantly reduced BrdUrd incorporation into CYP 2C9-overexpressing cells so that values no longer differed from the control (Fig.1B). Treatment of control cells with sulfaphenazole did not influence either BrdUrd incorporation or the expression of CYP 2C9 protein (data not shown). Under the same experimental conditions, basic fibroblast growth factor (100 ng/ml) and vascular endothelial growth factor (100 ng/ml) enhanced BrdUrd incorporation by 2.5 ± 0.1- and 2.8 ± 0.2-fold (n = 4), respectively. Overexpression of CYP 2C9 was also associated with a significant increase in the number of endothelial cells, an effect that was abolished by sulfaphenazole (Fig. 1C). Extracellular mitogens induce cell proliferation via receptor-mediated signaling targeting the cell cycle machinery. Cyclins, especially the D-type cyclins, function as critical sensors of these mitogenic signals, which accumulate and assemble with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) during G1 phase to promote cell cycle progression. To investigate whether or not CYP 2C9 influences cyclin expression to induce cell proliferation, we determined the expression of cyclin D1 in endothelial cells transfected with either a control vector or CYP 2C9. CYP 2C9 significantly increased the expression of cyclin D1 as compared with control vector-transfected cells (Fig.2). The increase in cyclin D1 expression was ∼2-fold above control levels after 24 h and ∼2.5-fold above control levels after 36 h. Incubation of endothelial cells with sulfaphenazole (30 μm) prevented the CYP 2C9-induced up-regulation of cyclin D1, whereas basal cyclin D1 expression in control vector-transfected cells was not affected by the CYP inhibitor (Fig. 3A). 11,12-EET, which is a product of the metabolism of arachidonic acid by CYP 2C9 (17Daikh B.E.

The activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases was determined by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies. Although no change in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation could be detected (data not shown), the p38 MAP kinase was phosphorylated and thus activated in CYP 2C9-overexpressing endothelial cells (Fig.4A). On the other hand, overexpression of endothelial cells with CYP 2C9 decreased the basal activity of JNK, assessed in an in vitro kinase assay using GST-Jun as a substrate (Fig. 4B). In these experiments, JNK activity was reduced by ∼60 and 20% at 24 and 36 h after transfection, respectively. To delineate the role of the differential activation of JNK and p38 in the CYP 2C9 signaling cascade leading to enhanced cyclin D1 expression, endothelial cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding for CYP 2C9 and either wild type or dominant negative forms of the p38 MAP kinase or JNK. Cotransfection of dominant negative as well as the wild type p38 MAP kinase with CYP 2C9 did not affect cyclin D1 expression (data not shown), excluding a role for p38 MAP kinase in the CYP 2C9-induced cyclin D1 up-regulation. The CYP 2C9-mediated up-regulation of cyclin D1 was, however, almost completely reversed by coexpression of wild type JNK1 with CYP 2C9. In contrast, cotransfecting dominant negative JNK1 with CYP 2C9 restored the CYP 2C9-induced increase in cyclin D1 expression (Fig.5A). These alterations in cyclin D1 expression were paralleled by changes in BrdUrd incorporation. When endothelial cells were transfected with wild type or dominant negative JNK1, no changes in cyclin D1 expression were detected (data not shown), and BrdUrd incorporation was similar to that detected in cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 (Fig. 5B). As shown above, overexpression of CYP 2C9 increased BrdUrd incorporation. This effect was unaffected by cotransfection of CYP 2C9 and a dominant negative JNK1 but was completely abolished in cells cotransfected with CYP 2C9 and wild type JNK1 (Fig. 5B). Inactivation or attenuation of JNK signaling is linked to the dephosphorylation of JNKs on their regulatory threonine and tyrosine residues by a family of dual specificity phosphatases. One phosphatase, which inhibits JNK in vivo and in vitro, is MKP-1 (18Hirsch D.D. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4568-4575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of CYP 2C9 on MKP-1 expression. Transfection of endothelial cells with CYP 2C9 increased the expression of MKP-1 protein by ∼5-fold (Fig.6). Moreover, the time course of MKP-1 induction paralleled the CYP 2C9-mediated decrease in JNK activity, suggesting a role for MKP-1 as a mediator of the inhibitory effect of CYP 2C9 on JNK. Since CYP 2C9 generates EETs as well as ROS, both of which can affect the activation of MAP kinases as well as cell proliferation (7Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Michaelis U.R. Kiss L. Popp R. Busse R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol.

Rodriguez-Puyol D. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 35: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we compared the effects of 11,12-EET and H2O2 on JNK activity and MKP-1 expression. Stimulation of endothelial cells with 11,12-EET (1 μm) elicited a marked and time-dependent decrease in basal JNK activity, which was pronounced 1 h after stimulation (Fig.7A). Although 11,12-EET was applied only once, JNK activity remained attenuated over 12 h. Incubation of endothelial cells with H2O2 (50 μm), on the other hand, increased the activity of JNK1 (Fig. 7B). In accordance with the effects of CYP 2C9 overexpression on JNK activity, MKP-1 protein levels were time dependently increased in response to stimulation with 11,12-EET (Fig.8). The increase in MKP-1 expression paralleled the time course of JNK inactivation, suggesting that the up-regulation of MKP-1 was responsible for the EET-induced inhibition of JNK activity. Incubation of endothelial cells with H2O2 had no effect on MKP-1 expression (data not shown). CYP 2C9-derived EETs rather than ROS are therefore the most likely mediators of the enhanced cyclin D1 expression and endothelial cell proliferation. We have demonstrated previously that the CYP 2C9 product, 11,12-EET, activates multiple signal transduction pathways in native and cultured endothelial cells and that overexpression of a CYP 2C epoxygenase enhances endothelial cell numbers (7Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Michaelis U.R. Kiss L. Popp R. Busse R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 442: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, we set out to elucidate the intracellular signal transduction cascade linking enhanced CYP expression and EET production with proliferation. The results of the present investigation demonstrate that the overexpression of CYP 2C9 in human endothelial cells stimulates cell proliferation by targeting the expression of the cell cycle regulatory protein, cyclin D1. The overexpression of CYP 2C9 increased the generation of EETs, which enhanced the expression of the immediate early gene product MKP-1. An MKP-1-mediated reduction in JNK activity resulted in an enhanced expression of cyclin D1, which mediated the proliferative effect of CYP 2C9 overexpression in endothelial cells. Progression through the mammalian cell cycle requires the activation of CDKs by their association with the cyclin proteins that are regulatory subunits. Different CDK-cyclin holoenzymes are activated at specific phases of the cell cycle, and active CDK-cyclin complexes phosphorylate the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) and the related pocket proteins p107 and p130 from mid-G1 to mitosis. As a consequence of Rb hyperphosphorylation, the association between Rb and the transcription factor E2F is disrupted, facilitating the transcription of a bank of genes essential for DNA synthesis and S phase progression (21Ekholm S.V. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). We concentrated on the CYP 2C9-induced alterations in cyclin D1 expression as this relatively labile cyclin provides a link between mitogenic cues and the cell cycle machinery. Numerous pathways have been reported to regulate the expression of cyclin D1, but the MAP kinase family is generally assumed to play a crucial role in this process (22Cook S.J. Balmanno K. Garner A. Millar T. Taverner C. Todd D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type investigated, proliferative stimuli have been linked to the activation as well as the inactivation of ERK1/2, JNK, and the p38 MAP kinase (23Wilkinson M.G. Millar J.B. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we observed that the phosphorylation and thus presumably the activation of the p38 MAP kinase was enhanced in CYP 2C9-overexpressing endothelial cells, whereas the activity of JNK was attenuated, and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was unaffected. Of the MAP kinases affected by CYP 2C9, a link between kinase activity and cyclin D1 expression could only be made for JNK, and a decrease in JNK activity was associated with an increase in cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, coexpression of CYP 2C9 and JNK prevented the CYP 2C9-induced induction of cyclin D1 expression as well as the CYP 2C9-induced increase in endothelial cell proliferation. Cyclin D1 expression and proliferation were, however, enhanced in endothelial cells, which overexpressed both CYP 2C9 and a dominant negative JNK mutant. Overexpressing CYP 2C9 together with either a wild type or dominant negative p38 MAP kinase did not affect cyclin D1 levels. The JNK/stress-activated protein kinase pathway is activated by numerous cellular stresses, and although it has been implicated in mediating apoptosis and growth factor signaling, its role in endothelial cell growth is unclear. The limited number of studies that specifically address the role of JNK in endothelial cell proliferation has, however, indicated that in vascular endothelial growth factor-treated and integrin-activated endothelial cells, the activation rather than the inactivation of JNK is associated with an increase in cyclin D1 expression, as well as endothelial cell proliferation and migration (24Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26722-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25Oktay M. Wary K.K. Dans M. Birge R.B. Giancotti F.G. J.

It is, however, more than likely that JNK activity is differentially regulated by different proliferative stimuli as, for example, insulin-stimulated cell proliferation and survival is reported to involve the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated inhibition of JNK activity (27Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Caron M. Atfi A. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the precise molecular steps between CYP-dependent JNK inactivation and cyclin D1 up-regulation remain to be identified, our findings indicate a novel role for JNK in the control of cyclin D1 expression in endothelial cells. To determine how CYP 2C9 attenuates the activity of JNK, we assessed the effects of CYP overexpression on the expression of MKP-1, a dual specificity protein phosphatase that is reported to exhibit a certain specificity/preference for JNK-1 (18Hirsch D.D. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4568-4575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Hofken T. Keller N. Fleischer F. Goke B. Wagner A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CYP 2C9 overexpression resulted in the induction of MKP-1 with a time course that paralleled the decrease in JNK activity and the increase in cyclin D1 expression. CYP 2C9 does not only generate EETs in endothelial cells, and this enzyme, like other CYP epoxygenases, generates ROS in amounts sufficient to affect intracellular signaling (14Fleming I. Michaelis U.R. Bredenkotter D. Fisslthaler B. Dehghani F. Brandes R.P. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Because ROS, such as superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), have also been reported to affect MKP expression, MAP kinase activity, and cell proliferation (20Ruiz-Gines J.A. Lopez-Ongil S. Gonzalez-Rubio M. Gonzalez-Santiago L. Rodriguez-Puyol M. Rodriguez-Puyol D. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 35: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Tournier C. Thomas G. Pierre J.

Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 31Irani K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), we determined whether or not the effects of CYP 2C9 overexpression could be mimicked by incubating endothelial cells with 11,12-EET or H2O2. We found that 11,12-EET and H2O2 exert contrasting effects on JNK activity in endothelial cells in that EET stimulation decreased the JNK-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun, whereas H2O2 increased kinase activity. Similarly, 11,12-EET, but not H2O2, induced the expression of MKP-1. Although our results suggest that EET-mediated alterations in the MKP-1 expression and JNK activity regulate the expression of cyclin D1, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional parallel signaling pathways are also involved. For example, recent reports have suggested that EETs are capable of activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (32Chen J.-K. Wang D.-W. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4764-4769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which results in the activation of the protein kinase B/Akt (8Chen J.K. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6322-6331Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The activation of protein kinase B/Akt could contribute to CYP 2C9-induced cell proliferation by inhibiting the glycogen synthase kinase-3β-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of cyclin D1 (33Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar) as well as the phosphorylation and degradation of p21Cip1 (34Rössig L. Badorff C. Holzmann Y. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Indeed, p21Cip1 expression is enhanced in endothelial cells overexpressing CYP 2C9, 2M. Potente, unpublished observations. and p21Cip1has been shown to be a positive regulator of cyclin D-dependent kinases and to promote cell cycle progression by acting as an essential assembly factor for cyclin D-CDK complexes (35LaBaer J.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). A further possibility is that EET signaling involves cross-talk with the epidermal growth factor receptor (32Chen J.-K. Wang D.-W. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4764-4769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and that this receptor may function directly as a transcription factor to enhance cyclin D1 expression (38Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Thus, it is certainly feasible that at least part of the proliferative effects of CYP 2C9 overexpression in endothelial cells can also be attributed to the parallel activation of signaling cascades not directly affecting JNK. Epoxygenase-derived EETs are now recognized as important modulators of intracellular signal transduction cascades, but it is not clear exactly how EETs can initiate their effects on cell signaling. Two modes of cell activation by EETs have been proposed. The first involves the activation of a putative extra- or intracellular EET receptor (39Wong P.Y. Lai P.S. Falck J.R. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2000; 62: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the second involves the incorporation of EETs into the plasma membrane where they may associate with effector molecules such as ADP-ribosyltransferases (40Li P.-L. Chen C.-L. Bortell R. Campbell W.B. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the small GTP-binding protein Ras (41Muthalif M.M. Uddin M.R. Fatima S. Parmentier J. Khandekar Z. Malik K.U. Prostaglandins. 2001; 65: 33-43Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or protein kinase A (42Imig J.D. Inscho E.W. Deichamnn P.C. Reddy K.M. Falck J.R. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 408-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the initial steps in the signal cascade remain to be elucidated, the results of the present study clearly demonstrate that CYP epoxygenase-derived EETs induce the expression of the immediate early gene product MKP-1, which dephosphorylates and inactivates JNK, thus enhancing cyclin D1 levels and promoting endothelial cell proliferation. We are indebted to Isabel Winter for expert technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2013288351,"We have previously shown that intraarticular treatment with a hyaluronan (HA) preparation (840 kDa), HA84, up-regulates heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) expression and suppresses degeneration of synovial cells in an arthritis model. In that study, the HA84 administered was degraded into HA oligosaccharides in the synovial tissue, suggesting that HA84 or degradation products of HA may up-regulate Hsp72 expression. Thus, in the present study, we examined the effects of HA of various molecular sizes on Hsp72 expression and cell death in stressed cells. Western blotting analysis showed that treatment of K562 cells with HA tetrasaccharides up-regulated Hsp72 expression after exposure to hyperthermia. On the other hand, treatment of the cells with HA of other sizes (di-, hexa-, deca-, dodecasaccharides), HA84, or tetrasaccharides of keratan sulfate did not elicit any change in expression of the Hsp72 protein. Treatment of the cells with tetrasaccharides of HA up-regulated not only expression of the Hsp72 protein but also Hsp72 mRNA expression and enhanced activation of HSF1, a transcription factor controlling Hsp72 expression, after exposure to hyperthermia. Because the level of Hsp72 protein was not affected by tetrasaccharides of HA when the K562 cells were kept at 37 °C without any stress, it is evident that tetrasaccharides of HA did not act as a stress factor. In addition, tetrasaccharides of HA suppressed cell death in the case of K562 cells exposed to hyperthermia and of PC12 cells under serum deprivation. These results suggest that a certain size of oligosaccharides,i.e. the tetrasaccharides of HA, up-regulates Hsp72 expression by enhancing the activation of HSF1 under stress conditions and suppresses cell death.

We have previously shown that intraarticular treatment with hyaluronan (HA) preparation (840 kDa), HA84, suppresses degeneration of synovial cells in a canine arthritis model and up-regulates Hsp72 expression (6.Asari A.

Uchiyama Y. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1998; 61: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In that study, we also injected fluorescent-labeled HA84 in synovial tissues and found that some labeled HA particles could not be detected by means of an HA-binding protein that binds specifically to HA molecules larger than decasaccharides (7.Asari A. Miyauchi S. Matsuzaka S. Itoh T. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1998; 61: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that HA oligosaccharides formed through degradation of HA84 in the tissue might suppress cell damage by up-regulating Hsp72 expression. In the present study, we prepared HA oligosaccharides of various molecular sizes and treated cultured cells with them under stress conditions in an effort to understand the appropriate size of HA oligosaccharides required to up-regulate Hsp72 expression or to suppress cell death. Effects of HA molecules on Hsp72 were investigated by examining both Hsp72 protein levels and Hsp72 mRNA levels, and the activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a transcription factor controlling Hsps expression, in K562 cells exposed to the stress of hyperthermia. HSF1 is known to be transferred to the nucleus from the cytoplasm, and it binds to a heat shock element (HSE) in the DNA (8.Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol.

Moreover, HSF1 is phosphorylated, and its molecular weight thereby increases when activated soon after heat shock treatment (9.Xia W. Voellmy R. J. Biol.

In addition to these activities, we show here a novel activity of HA oligosaccharides, the acceleration of Hsp72 expression through activation of HSF1 under stress conditions and its suppressive effect on cell death. HA, chondroitin sulfate C type, keratan sulfate, chondroitinase ACI, and chondroitinase ACII were obtained from Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). Other reagents and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. Glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharides were prepared by the modified method of Inoue and Nagasawa (12.Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 141: 99-110Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Saturated HA tetra-(HA4), hexa- (HA6), octa-(HA8), deca-(HA10), and dodeca- (HA12) saccharides were prepared from the degradation products generated by treatment of HA with testicular hyaluronidase (Biozyme Laboratory, Gwent, UK) in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.3, containing 150 mm NaCl at 37 °C. Saturated disaccharides of HA (HA2) were prepared from the degradation products generated by treatment of HA with dimethyl sulfoxide containing 10% of 0.1 m HCl for 16 h at 95 °C. Unsaturated HA di- (ΔHA2), tetra-(ΔHA4), and hexa-(ΔHA6) saccharides were generated by enzymatic digestion of HA with chondroitinase ACI in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 6.0, at 30 °C and separated by the same chromatography method as mentioned above. Chondroitin tetrasaccharides (Ch04) were generated by treatment of chondroitin sulfate C type with the dimethyl sulfoxide containing HCl. Chondroitin sulfate C type tetrasaccharides (ChS4) were prepared by testicular hyaluronidase (Biozyme) digestion of chondroitin sulfate C type. Keratan sulfate oligosaccharides, Gal(SO3)-GlcNAc(SO3) [L4] and Gal(SO3)-GlcNAc(SO3)-Gal(SO3)-GlcNAc(SO3) [L4L4], were prepared from a keratanase II (Seikagaku Corporation) digest of keratan sulfate (shark fin, Seikagaku Corporation) through sequential steps of gel filtration and anion exchange adsorption column chromatography. The degraded oligosaccharides were divided into fractions of each size by sequential steps of anion exchange chromatography. All oligosaccharides were checked by Limulus amebocyte lysate assays using Toxicolor LS Set (Seikagaku Corporation). HA4contains 0.03 pg/mg endotoxins, and similar results were obtained in other oligosaccharides. Sizes and purity of HA oligosaccharides were determined by HPLC, fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. 2A. Tawada, T. Masa, Y. Oonuki, A. Watanabe, Y. Matsuzaki, and A. Asari, submitted for publication. Assignments of1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and of element analysis were obtained for each HA oligosaccharide.2Oligosaccharides of chondroitin, chondroitin sulfate C type, and keratan sulfate were analyzed by HPLC and/or capillary electrophoresis (data not shown). In addition, keratan sulfate oligosaccharides have been analyzed by mass spectrometry (13.Kubota M. Yoshida K. Tawada A. Ohashi M. Eur. J. Mass. Spectrom. 2000; 6: 193-203Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Western blotting was done with K562 cells that were incubated in the presence of 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml HA2, ΔHA4, HA6, HA10, HA12, HA84, or L4L4 at 43 °C for 20 min followed by further incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. K562 cells incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and 20 min without any treatment were used as the “no heat shock” normal control. Moreover, K562 cells incubated in the presence of ΔHA4 at 37 °C for 2 h and 20 min were examined by Western blotting to investigate whether Hsp72 expression is induced by ΔHA4 under non-stress conditions. For the detection of Hsp72 protein expression by flow cytometry, K562 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml ΔHA4 at 43 °C for 20 min followed by further incubation at 37 °C for 2 or 4 h. To detect Hsp72 mRNA expression by Northern blotting, K562 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml ΔHA4at 43 °C for 20 min with or without further incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 1 h, or 2 h. To evaluate HSF1 activation by Western blotting, K562 cells were incubated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml ΔHA4, HA4, HA6, HA8, or HA84. The K562 cells were stressed at 42 or 43 °C for 20 min. K562 cells incubated at 37 °C for 20 min without any treatment were used as the no heat shock normal control. To analyze HSF1 retained in the nuclear fraction by flow cytometry and to observe the results of immunostaining specific for HSF1 by confocal laser scanning microscopy, K562 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml ΔHA4 at 43 °C for 20 min with or without further incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. Moreover, to investigate the effect of ΔHA4 on activation of HSF1 under non-stress conditions, K562 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml ΔHA4 for 2 h and 20 min at 37 °C. For the detection of Hsp72, monoclonal anti-Hsp72 antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the first antibody, and horseradish peroxidase- or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratory, West Grove, PA) was used as the second antibody. For the detection of HSF1, rabbit anti-HSF1 polyclonal antibody (Stressgene, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) was used as the first antibody, and horseradish peroxidase- or FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratory) was used as the second antibody. K562 cells were surveyed by antibodies against Hsp72 or HSF1 described above. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. To reduce nonspecific interactions, the membrane was blocked by incubation with 0.3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at 37 °C for 1 h. Following incubation with the first antibodies at 4 °C overnight, the membrane was washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS and incubated with the secondary antibodies described above at 37 °C for 1 h. Color development was performed with 0.05% diaminobenzidine solution in TBS containing 0.01% H2O2. Total RNA was prepared from control K562 cells and each culture of ΔHA4-treated cells. Each sample was fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. For hybridization, the membrane was incubated overnight at 42 °C in the presence of a denatured32P-labeled human hsp72 oligonucleotide probe (Oncogene Science, Inc., Cambridge, MA) added to the prehybridization solution. A labeled cDNA probe specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a hybridization control. The membrane was washed at room temperature in saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA and then subjected to autoradiography. K562 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and then permeabilized by incubation in 0.01% Tween 80 in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and then with 1:200 diluted rabbit anti-HSF1 polyclonal antibody (Stressgene) overnight at 4 °C followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100, Jackson Laboratory) for 1 h at room temperature. Then they were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). For detection of intracellular Hsp72 in K562 cells, we used the monoclonal anti-Hsp72 antibody as described above and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratory). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and then permeabilized by incubation in a solution of 0.01% Tween 80 in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C and then with anti-Hsp72 antibody (1:200) overnight at 4 °C followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. To detect nuclear HSF1 in K562 cells, we used rabbit anti-HSF1 polyclonal antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Lab.). Before immunostaining, the nuclear fraction was obtained by mincing the cells in a HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) using a Dounce homogenizer followed by centrifugation at 1300 rpm for 5 min. Because activated HSF1 binds HSE in the nucleus of heat shocked cells, HSF1 is retained in the nucleus even after fractionation (14.Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). HSF1 retained in the nuclear fraction was measured by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lake, NJ) after immunostaining for HSF1. Before immunostaining, the nuclear fraction was incubated in HEPES buffer for 30 min to remove any HSF1 not bound to HSE. The nuclear fraction was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C and washed with PBS, and then the nuclei were permeabilized by incubation in a solution of 0.01% Tween 80 in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C and then with anti-HSF1 antibody (1:200) overnight at 4 °C followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. After immunostaining for Hsp72, HSF1, or Annexin V staining, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton-Dickinson) using an instrument equipped with a 15-mA ion laser and with filter settings for FITC. Ten thousand cells from each sample were computed in list mode, and data analysis was done with a commercial software program (CELLQuest, Becton-Dickinson). Analysis gates were set on leukocyte, according to forward and side scatter properties. To evaluate the effect of ΔHA4 on cell death induced by hyperthermia, K562 cells were incubated with 1 ng/ml ΔHA4 for 20 min at 43 °C followed by incubation for 2 or 4 h at 37 °C. K562 cells incubated for 4 h at 37 °C without any treatment were used as a no heat shock normal control. Then these cells were incubated with Annexin V (Bender Medsystems, Vienna, Austria), which binds to phosphatidylserine exposed on the outer surface of the cell membrane of dead cells, just after cell culture as described above. Cell death was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton-Dickinson). It has been reported that serum deprivation induces apoptosis in PC12 cells (15.Ohsawa Y. Isahara K. Kanamori S. Shibata M. Kametaka S. Gotow T. Watanabe T. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1998; 61: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were cultured under conditions of serum deprivation in the presence of HA oligosaccharides, HA84, L4, L4L4, Ch04, and ChS4 at 100 ng/ml. The cell death assay was done by the trypan blue exclusion method, 24 h after the start of culture. The survival rate of cells cultured in the absence of serum but in the presence of 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor was taken to be 100%. One mg of HA4 was digested with 0.01 units of chondroitinase ACII in 0.1 msodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, at 37 °C for 20 h. The reaction was stopped by boiling 3 min. Boiled chondroitinase ACII was added to HA4 as a negative control. These samples were ultrafiltrated with Centricon Plus-20 10K (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) to remove endotoxins and separated by anion exchange chromatography. The separated oligosaccharides were identified by HPLC. These products of HA4 were applied in the cell death assay using PC12 cells described above. Normal phase HPLC was performed using YMC-pack NH2 (4.0 × 250 mm, YMC, Kyoto, Japan). Oligosaccharides were eluted with a linear gradient of 2–100% 0.8m NaH2PO4 at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C. Absorbance was monitored at 210 nm. Comparisons were analyzed by using the unpaired Student's t test or Dunnet multiple comparison test. Hsp72 protein expression was detected even in non-treated K562 cells not exposed to hyperthermia (Fig. 1,A and B). The results showed that treatment of the K562 cells with ΔHA4 up-regulated Hsp72 expression 2 h after exposure to hyperthermia (Fig. 1 A). The same result was obtained in the case of HA4-treated cells (data not shown). The Hsp72 protein level was not changed by treatment with HA2, HA6, HA84, L4L4 (Fig. 1 A), HA12 (data not shown), or HA10 (data not shown) in the case of K562 cells exposed to hyperthermia. Hsp72 expression was not affected by ΔHA4 treatment in the case of cells not exposed to hyperthermia (Fig. 1 B). Flow cytometry showed that treatment with 1 ng/ml ΔHA4 up-regulated and down-regulated Hsp72 expression 2 and 4 h after exposure to hyperthermia, respectively (Fig. 2). Northern blotting analysis showed that Hsp72 mRNA expression in K562 cells was up-regulated 30 min and 1 h after exposure to hyperthermia as a result of treatment with ΔHA4 (Fig. 3).Figure 2Flow cytometric analysis of Hsp72 expression.

In addition, HA4 or ΔHA4 increased the levels of both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated HSF1 when the cells were exposed to hyperthermia at 43 °C (Fig. 4 B). Activation of HSF1 was little influenced by HA84 (Fig. 4 B) or HA6(data not shown). Treatment with HA8 up-regulated the level of non-phosphorylated HSF1 but not of phosphorylated HSF1 (Fig. 4 B). The treatment with ΔHA4 did not alter the retention of HSF1 in the nucleus of cells cultured at 37 °C (Fig. 5). The level of HSF1 retained in the nucleus was found to be elevated immediately after and 2 h after exposure to hyperthermia (Fig. 5). The level of HSF1 retained in the nucleus was even more elevated in the presence of ΔHA4immediately after exposure to hyperthermia (Fig. 5). However, in cells treated with ΔHA4, the level of HSF1 retained in the nucleus was slightly diminished 2 h after exposure to hyperthermia (Fig. 5). Immunodeposits of HSF1 were detected in ΔHA4-treated (Fig. 6 B) as well as non-treated (Fig. 6 A) K562 cells not exposed to hyperthermia. After exposure to hyperthermia, immunodeposits of HSF1 were detected as aggregated granular structures in the K562 cells incubated in the absence of ΔHA4 (Fig. 6, Cand E). The HSF1-positive granules in the cells incubated at 37 °C for a further 2 h (Fig. 6 E) were slightly larger in size than those observed immediately after exposure to hyperthermia (Fig. 6 C). The immunodeposits of HSF1 in the K562 cells incubated in the presence of ΔHA4 (Fig. 6,D and F) were finer than those in the cells incubated in the absence of ΔHA4 (Fig. 6, Cand E) after exposure to hyperthermia. Treatment with ΔHA4 suppressed cell death in the case of K562 cells as determined 2 and 4 h after exposure to hyperthermia (Fig. 7). Apoptosis of PC12 cells under conditions of serum deprivation was prevented by treatment of the cells with tetrasaccharides of HA (Fig. 8). On the other hand, treatment with the other HA oligosaccharides, HA84, L4, L4L4, Ch04, or ChS4 faintly suppressed the cell death (Fig. 8).Figure 8Survival rates of PC12 cells under conditions of serum deprivation in the presence or absence (None) of several kinds of saccharides (100 ng/ml). The survival rate of PC12 cells treated with nerve growth factor (NGF) was taken to be 100%.

HPLC analysis showed that HA4 was depolymerized into disaccharides (ΔHA2 plus HA2) by the treatment with chondroitinase ACII (Fig. 9). HA4 was not depolymerized by the treatment with boiled chondroitinase ACII (Fig. 9). Apoptosis of PC12 cells under conditions of serum deprivation was not prevented by treatment of the cells with the digestion products of HA4,i.e. ΔHA2 plus HA2 (Fig. 10), whereas apoptosis of PC12 cells was suppressed by HA4 treated with boiled chondroitinase ACII (Fig. 10).Figure 10Effects of digestion product of HA4 on cell death on the survival rates of PC12 cells under conditions of serum deprivation.

High molecular weight HA, HA84, and other kinds of GAG oligosaccharides, i.e. L4, L4L4, Ch04, or ChS4, showed little effect on Hsp72 expression and/or cell death. HA6 oligomers have been used as a tool for probing the cell surface in a study of HA receptor function (16.Knudson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and was shown to be the minimum size required to effectively compete with native HA in binding to chondrocytes via CD44 surface receptors (17.Knudson C.B. Kundson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). K562 cells were used as CD44-negative cell lines (18.Dougherty G.J. Landorp P.M. Cooper D.L. Humphries R.K. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19.Schrager H.M. Alberti S. Cywes C. Dougherty G.J. Wessels M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1708-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that CD44 expression on the K562 cell surface is very weak by flow cytometry (data not shown). The treatment with HA4 as well as ΔHA4 up-regulated the Hsp72 expression in the present study, suggesting the possibility that there may be as yet unidentified receptors for HA tetrasaccharides in the cells that induce the signal transduction to up-regulate the Hsp72 expression. As shown by Western blotting, the treatment with ΔHA4 as well as HA4 activated HSF1, indicating that the carboxyl group of the non-reducing end of HA tetrasaccharides is not essential to up-regulate the activation of HSF1. Hsp72 expression was not affected by ΔHA4 treatment in the case of cells not exposed to hyperthermia, suggesting that ΔHA4 treatment does not induce Hsp72 expression under non-stress conditions but up-regulates it under stress conditions. Sistonen et al. have shown that HSF1 is transferred from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in K562 cells after exposure to hyperthermia as demonstrated by a biochemical method examining nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (20.Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2087-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It has been reported that there is a significant decrease in the level of HSF in the nuclear fraction prepared from unshocked cells, whereas nuclei from heat-shocked cells retain a high level of HSF (14.Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Because activated HSF1 binds to HSE in the nucleus of heat shocked cells, the activated HSF1 is retained in the nucleus even after fractionation (14.Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Activation of HSF1, which is reflected by nuclear HSF1 levels, was up-regulated immediately after exposure to hyperthermia and down-regulated 2 h after exposure to hyperthermia in the ΔHA4-treated cells as compared with non-treated cells. In the ΔHA4-treated cells, Hsp72 expression was up- and down-regulated 2 and 4 h after exposure to hyperthermia, respectively. Moreover, Hsp72 mRNA expression was up-regulated 30 min and 1 h but not 2 h after exposure to hyperthermia in the ΔHA4-treated cells. These results suggest that the treatment with ΔHA4 accelerates not only HSF1 activation followed by the acceleration of Hsp72 expression but also the feedback regulation that controls the disappearance of Hsp72 (Fig. 11). Activation of HSF1 involves the conversion of HSF1 from a latent cytoplasmic monomer to a trimeric nuclear protein complex that controls the transcription of heat shock genes (21.Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 22.Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization and DNA binding, which occur as the first step in activation of HSF1, are not sufficient for the full transcriptional competence of HSF1 (8.Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 9.Xia W. Voellmy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4094-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is required as the second step in HSF1 activation to stimulate transcription (9.Xia W. Voellmy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4094-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Localization and retention of HSF1 in the nucleus, which means DNA binding of HSF1, was found to be accelerated by the ΔHA4 treatment in the present study. In addition, we showed that phosphorylation of HSF1 were accelerated by the treatment with ΔHA4. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as salicylate are known to enhance thermotolerance in K562 cells by prolonging Hsp70 expression (23.Amici C. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4452-4457PubMed Google Scholar). Such drugs induce HSF binding to HSE even under non-stress conditions, but they are unable to induce Hsp70 transcription (24.Jurivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R.A. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In the present study, retention of HSF1 in the nucleus was not changed by ΔHA4 treatment under non-stress conditions. This suggests that the mechanism of the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on Hsp70 expression differs from that of ΔHA4. When cells were exposed to severe hyperthermia (43 °C), treatment of ΔHA4 or HA4 up-regulated both non-activated (non-phosphorylated) and activated (phosphorylated) HSF1 levels. These results indicate that the treatment of ΔHA4 or HA4 induces not only the activation but also the synthesis of HSF1. The treatment with ΔHA4 suppressed the formation of aggregated granules of HSF1 in cells exposed to hyperthermia. Sargeet al. have shown that the kinetics of appearance of HSF1 granules in the nuclei of HeLa cells during heat shock is very well correlated with the kinetics of HSF DNA binding and heat shock gene transcription (20.Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2087-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Alternatively, they noted the possibility that the granules observed may represent large aggregated particles of inactive HSF1. This coincides well with our present findings that the ΔHA4 treatment suppresses HSF1 formation of aggregated granules of HSF1 and up-regulates the HSF1 activation as well as Hsp72 expression after exposure to hyperthermia. It seems likely that the finer the HSF1 particles, the sooner the HSF1 can move between nucleus and cytoplasm. This coincides well with the result that disappearance as well as expression of Hsp72 protein were also accelerated by the treatment with ΔHA4 (Fig. 11). Further studies, however, are required to elucidate the precise mechanism involved in the activation of HSF1 by ΔHA4. Cell death was suppressed in the case of cells treated with HA4 as determined both 2 and 4 h after exposure to hyperthermia in the present study. The suppression of cell death observed 4 h after exposure to hyperthermia may be due to the prior up-regulation of Hsp72 expression in cells treated with ΔHA4 because the Hsp72 level was lower in the ΔHA4-treated cells than non-treated cells 4 h after exposure to hyperthermia (Fig. 11). PC12 cells undergo apoptosis when cultured under conditions of serum deprivation (15.Ohsawa Y. Isahara K. Kanamori S. Shibata M. Kametaka S. Gotow T. Watanabe T. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Arch. Histol.

To confirm the effect of HA oligosaccharides on cell death in a cell type except for K562 cells under stress conditions other than hyperthermia, we treated PC12 cells with HA oligosaccharides under conditions of serum deprivation in the present study. In this experiment, tetrasaccharides of HA were found to be more effective in suppressing cell death than the other HA oligosaccharides tested. Further experiments are required to elucidate the relationship between cell death and Hsp72 expression in PC12 cells under conditions of serum deprivation. After digestion of HA4 by chondroitinase ACII, the product did not suppress cell death of PC12 cells, confirming the specificity of the suppressive effect of HA4 on the cell death. Hyaluronidase activity is known to be elevated in tumors (26.Lokeshwar V.B. Rubinowicz D. Schroeder G.L. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Block N.L. Nadji M. Lokeshwar B.L. J. Biol.

Fraisse L. Pouliquen Y. Robert L. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been reported that hyaluronic acid with a molecular mass about 1.2 MDa inhibits the advanced glycation endproducts-induced activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the NF-κB-regulated cytokines interleukin-1α, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (29.Neumann A. Schinzel R. Palm D. Riederer P. Munch G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition to it, expression of interleukin-1β mRNA in synovium has been suppressed in the mild grades of osteoarthritis by the intraarticular treatment with high molecular mass HA (about 1.0 MDa) (30.Takahashi K. Goomer R.S. Harwood F. Kubo T. Hirasawa Y. Amiel D. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1999; 7: 182-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Moreover, high molecular mass HA is known to suppress the proliferation of endothelial cells (31.West D.C. Kumar S. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143 (281–285): 187-207PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, it is well known that low molecular weight HA induces angiogenesis (10.West D.C. Shaw D.M. Laurent T.C. The Chemistry, Biology, and Medical Applications of Hyaluronan and Its Derivatives. Portland Press Ltd., London1998: 227-233Google Scholar) and inflammation (11.Noble P.W. McKee C.M. Horton M.R. Laurent T.C. The Chemistry, Biology, and Medical Applications of Hyaluronan and Its Derivatives. Portland Press Ltd., London1998: 219-225Google Scholar). When HA is natively depolymerized by hyaluronidases or radicals in vivo, HA may acquire novel functions. One of them is the up-regulation of Hsp72 expression (Fig. 12). In conclusion, our results show that tetrasaccharides of HA up-regulate Hsp72 expression by enhancing the activation of HSF1 under stress conditions and suppress cell death (Fig. 12).

Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar). Inherited mutations in HERG have been identified and linked to congenital long QT syndrome (LQT2) (2.Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T.

Furthermore, drugs that suppress IKr have been linked to “acquired LQT” (3.Roden D.M. Balser J.R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 44: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These all point to the critical role played by IKr in maintaining cardiac electrical stability. Therefore, information about the structure of the IKr/HERG channel is important. Such information will help in rational drug design for agents that are useful for combating some forms of LQT syndrome (IKr/HERG agonists), or for agents with zero or low risk for inducing acquired LQT syndrome (no effects on IKr/HERG). rapid delayed rectifier humanether-a-go-go-related gene HERG-specific peptide toxin charybdotoxin long QT syndrome wild-type tetraethylammonium rapid delayed rectifier humanether-a-go-go-related gene HERG-specific peptide toxin charybdotoxin long QT syndrome wild-type tetraethylammonium One of the most critical factors in determining IKr/HERG function is its C-type inactivation process. This is the basis for the “inward rectification” property of IKr/HERG, which is important for shaping the action potentials in the heart. Inward rectification dictates that there is little or no outward IKr at positive plateau voltages (important for maintaining the plateau phase) but large outward IKr during phase 3 (ensuring efficient repolarization back to the resting membrane potential). Furthermore, the C-type inactivation process in the IKr/HERG channel appears to be intimately related to channel sensitivity to many different drugs (4.Ficker E. Jarolimek W. Kiehn J. Baumann A.

Res. 2000; 87: 1012-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). C-type inactivation results from conformational changes in the outer mouth region of the channel, which prevent current flow through the pore (7.Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Therefore, an important target for structural analysis is the outer mouth region of the IKr/HERG channel. There is a general consensus that the outer vestibules of various potassium channels share a common architecture (8.MacKinnon R. Reinhart P.H. White M.M. Neuron. 1988; 1: 997-1001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9.Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1201-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Indeed, homology modeling of outer vestibules of mammalian voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels based on the crystal structure of KcsA (9.Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar), a bacterial proton-gated potassium channel, has been successful in several cases (10.Rauer H. Lanigan M.D. Pennington M.W. Aiyar J. Ghanshani S. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1201-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, such a strategy may not be applicable to the HERG channel. First, the C-type inactivation in the IKr/HERG channel is unique among all potassium channels that have this gating process: C-type inactivation in IKr/HERG is extremely fast in onset and in reversal and is strongly voltage-dependent (11.Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These unique kinetic features suggest that conformational changes in the outer mouth region of HERG during membrane depolarization may be different from those of the other channels. Second, HERG has an unusually long S5-P linker (43 amino acids), much longer than the 14- to 18-amino acid S5-P linker seen in most other Kv channels, as well as the so-called “turret” of KcsA (see Fig. 1 A). We have shown that mutations in the middle of HERG's S5-P linker, far away from the P (pore) loop in the one-dimensional sequence, can have profound effects on the outer mouth properties of the channel (12.Dun W. Jiang M. Tseng G.-N. Pflugers Archiv. 1999; 439: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). There have been no reports on similar effects of mutations in the middle of S5-P linker for other Kv channels. Thus, the S5-P linker of HERG may play a unique structural and functional role. Understanding such a role may provide answers to questions such as why the C-type inactivation in the HERG channel has such unique kinetic properties and how C-type inactivation is related to the channel's sensitivity to various drugs. Peptide toxins have been very useful tools in structural analysis of potassium channels, well before the data of KscA crystal structure were available (13.Possani L.D. Selisko B. Gurrola G.B. Perspect. Drug Disc. Des. 1999; 15/16: 15-40Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14.Garcia M.L. Gao Y.-D. McManus O.B. Kaczorowski G.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Many short peptide scorpion toxins (α-KTx) are available that can block various potassium channels with differences in specificity and potency (13.Possani L.D. Selisko B. Gurrola G.B. Perspect. Drug Disc. Des. 1999; 15/16: 15-40Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14.Garcia M.L. Gao Y.-D. McManus O.B. Kaczorowski G.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15.Tytgat J. Chandy K.G. Garcia M.L. Gutman G.A. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. van der Walt J.J. Possani L.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Many α-KTx toxins have six cysteines, forming three disulfide bridges (15.Tytgat J. Chandy K.G. Garcia M.L. Gutman G.A. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. van der Walt J.J. Possani L.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). They have a well-conserved positive residue (Lys-27 in ChTx) that serves to plug the channel pore (Fig. 1 B) (16.Goldstein S.A.N. Miller C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1613-1619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). ErgTx is purified fromCentruroides noxius Hoffmann (GenBank™accession number CnErg1). It has 42 amino acids and 4 disulfide bonds (17.Scaloni A. Bottiglieri C. Ferrara L. Corona M. Gurrola G.B. Batista C. Wanke E. Possani L.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Its amino acid sequence and disulfide bond pattern are not homologous to those of representative α-KTx toxins shown in Fig. 1 B. Previous work has shown that ErgTx is a potent blocker of HERG expressed in mammalian cells and native IKr in guinea pig ventricular myocytes (IC50 in the low nanomolar range) (18.Gurrola G.B. Rosati B. Rocchetti M. Pimienta G. Zaza A. Arcangeli A. Olivotto M. Possani L.D. Wanke E. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It does not block IKs, IK, ATP, IRK1, or EAG at 1 μm (18.Gurrola G.B. Rosati B. Rocchetti M. Pimienta G. Zaza A. Arcangeli A. Olivotto M. Possani L.D. Wanke E. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that ErgTx sensitivity may be determined by the S5-P linker of the HERG channel (19.Pardo-Lopez L. Garcia-Valdes J. Gurrola G.B. Robertson G.A. Possani L.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Due to the four disulfide bonds, ErgTx should have a compact and rigid structure, amenable to NMR analysis of its solution structure. Our ultimate goal is to map the ErgTx binding site on HERG and to identify amino acid pairs that interact with each other across the toxin-channel interface (20.Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 21.Stocker M. Miller C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this way, we hope to obtain a “footprint” of the interaction surface of ErgTx on HERG and to derive the three-dimensional arrangement of relevant residues on the outer vestibule of this channel. This study is a first step toward that goal. We applied cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, replacing all residues in the outer vestibule region of HERG by cysteine one at a time, and studied how these mutations affect ErgTx binding to the channel. We chose cysteine, instead of alanine (22.Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) or lysine (23.Goldstein S.A.N. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), for two reasons. First, the cysteine side chain is small, hydrophobic, and usually well tolerated. Thus, it increases our chance of studying more mutant channels. Second, cysteine side chains can be specifically modified by methanethiosulfonate reagents. This will allow us to use different strategies to estimate the distances between channel residues of interests and the toxin binding site (21.Stocker M. Miller C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24.Gross A. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we propose that the central region of HERG's S5-P linker forms an amphipathic α-helix that interacts with the pore of the channel to form the ErgTx binding site. Venom was purified from scorpionsCentruroides noxius as described previously (17.Scaloni A. Bottiglieri C. Ferrara L. Corona M. Gurrola G.B. Batista C. Wanke E. Possani L.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18.Gurrola G.B. Rosati B. Rocchetti M. Pimienta G. Zaza A. Arcangeli A. Olivotto M. Possani L.D. Wanke E. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, crude venom was dissolved in water and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was lyophilized and kept at −20 °C until final purification. After Sephadex G-50 gel filtration, fraction II was directly applied to a semi-preparative C18 reverse-phase column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) and eluted with a linear gradient from 5% of solvent A (0.12% trifluoroacetic acid in water) to 60% solvent B (0.10% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over 90 min. The component eluted at ∼30 min was further chromatographed by high performance liquid chromatography using an analytical C18 reverse-phase column. This gave a major pure component (ErgTx), whose primary structure was obtained by direct amino acid sequencing and by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 B) (17.Scaloni A. Bottiglieri C. Ferrara L. Corona M. Gurrola G.B. Batista C. Wanke E. Possani L.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HERG in a vector pGH19 was a kind gift of Dr. Gail Robertson (University of Wisconsin-Madison). We subcloned the HERG cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number U04270) into the KpnI/XbaI site of a vector, pAlterMax, which was required for the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis procedure with a commercial kit (Altered Site II in vitromutagenesis system, Promega). Cysteine substitution mutations were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing around the mutation sites. In most cases, two separate colonies from each mutant were used for cRNA transcription and oocyte expression. No differences were seen in the phenotype of channels translated from the two cRNAs. For transcription, wild-type (WT) and mutant HERG sequences in the pAlterMax vector were linearized with NotI and transcribed using the T7 RNA polymerase and a commercial kit (mMESSAGE mMACHINE, Ambion, Austin, TX). All cRNA samples were quantified by denaturing RNA gels using densitometry (ChemiImager model 4400, α-Innotech Corp.). Oocyte isolation and cRNA injection were as described previously (25.Tseng-Crank J.C.L. Tseng G.-N. Schwartz A. Tanouye M.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, stage V oocytes were isolated from follicular cell layer after mild collagenase digestion and injected with cRNA solution using a Drummond digital microdispenser. The injection volume was ∼40 nl/oocyte, equivalent to cRNA of 12–18 ng/oocyte. Three to five days after cRNA injection, channel function was studied using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp method as previously described (26.Schreibmayer W. Lester H.A. Dascal N. Pflugers Archiv. 1994; 426: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). During recordings, oocytes were superfused with a low-Cl ND96 solution at room temperature. For experiments shown in Fig. 5, oocytes were not superfused but were placed in the bath solution of a fixed volume (1 ml). ErgTx was dissolved in sterile bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) solution at 2 μm and frozen in small aliquots. An aliquot was thawed and used for experiments in <2 days without refreezing. After control data were obtained, 5 μl of the ErgTx stock solution was added to the bath solution (1 ml) to reach a final concentration of 10 nm. Repetitive pipetting was needed to ensure complete equilibration of ErgTx in the bath solution. Toxin effects were evaluated when steady state was reached (4–10 min). Voltage clamp protocol generation and data acquisition were controlled by pClamp 5.5 (Axon Instruments). Data analysis was performed with pClamp 6 or 8, Excel (Microsoft) and PeakFit (Jandel Scientific). Specific protocols and methods of data analysis are described in the figure legends. Where appropriate, data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way analysis of variance, followed by Dunn's test (SigmaStat 2.0, SPSS). Fig. 2 A(panels a and c) shows the hallmark of wild-type (WT) HERG currents: strong inward rectification due to rapid onset and reversal of C-type inactivation in a voltage-dependent manner. A depolarization pulse to +60 mV elicited little outward current because of C-type inactivation. Subsequent repolarization to +40 to −60 mV induced outward tail currents with a distinct rising phase (recovery from C-type inactivation). This led to a prominent negative slope in the tail I–V relationship (+60 to −60 mV, Fig. 2 A, panel c). At more negative voltages, tail currents became less outward and reversed at −100 mV (reversal potential or E rev), close to the Nernst K+ equilibrium potential (E K ∼ −105 mV in 2 mm [K]o). Replacing histidine at position 587 to lysine (H587K, Fig. 2,top), disrupted both the C-type inactivation process and the K+ selectivity of the pore. Current traces from H587K were elicited by the same voltage clamp protocol as that used for WT HERG (Fig. 2 A, panel b). The step to +60 mV induced a prominent outward current. Subsequent repolarization steps elicited smaller outward currents that reversed between −10 and −20 mV. The I–V relationship of H587K was almost linear in the voltage range between −140 and 0 mV, with an upward turn at more positive voltages (Fig. 2 A, panel c). Therefore, the C-type inactivation process was disrupted in H587K. Furthermore, removing extracellular Na+ ions shifted theE rev of H587K in the negative direction to about −60 mV (Fig. 2 A, panel d), indicating that external Na+ ions contributed significantly to currents through the H587K channel pore. The calculated K+ to Na+ permeability ratio (P K:P Na) for H587K was 1.5 ± 0.1, much lower than that of the WT HERG (191 ± 91). These changes in H587K were not due to the added permanent positive charge, because increasing the protonation of H587 in WT HERG (by changing the extracellular pH from 8.5 to 6.5) did not affect the C-type inactivation process or the K:Na selectivity of the pore (27.Jiang M. Dun W. Tseng G.-N. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1283-H1292PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacing His-587 with proline creates the same phenotype as H587K (12.Dun W. Jiang M. Tseng G.-N. Pflugers Archiv. 1999; 439: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the extracellular S5-P linker of HERG, or at least the middle of this linker including position 587, participates in conformational changes that determine the channel's outer mouth properties. There has been no report on similar effects of mutations made in the S5-P linker of the Shaker channel on the channel's outer mouth properties. Fig. 2 B illustrates another example of differences between HERG and Shaker in their outer mouth properties. Position 449 in the Shaker channel is located at the external entrance to the pore, corresponding to position 631 of the HERG channel (Fig. 1 A). It is an important determinant of channel sensitivity to external TEA (28.Heginbotham L. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Replacing the threonine residue at this position with an aromatic residue (T449Y and T449F) greatly enhances TEA binding (due to a stabilizing interaction between positively charged TEA and π-electrons of the aromatic ring at 449), while replacing Thr-449 with a positively charged residue (T449K) has the opposite effect (due to electrostatic repulsion) (28.Heginbotham L. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We tested the effects of mutating the equivalent residue in the HERG channel (Ser-631) on TEA potency (29.Fan J.-S. Jiang M. Dun W. McDonald T.V. Tseng G.-N. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 3128-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). TEA blocked the outer mouth of the WT HERG channel with an IC50 of ∼50 mm. This is reflected by the decrease of outward tail current at −80 mV in Fig. 2 B (panel a). The appearance of a prominent outward peak and the higher level of outward current at +20 mV in the presence of TEA was due to an interference of C-type inactivation by TEA bound to the outer mouth of the channel (7.Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, replacing Ser-631 with an aromatic residue (S631Y) reduced the sensitivity to external TEA (Fig. 2 B, panel b). Furthermore, replacing Ser-631 with a negatively charged residue (S631E) or a positively charged residue (S631K) reduced the sensitivity to TEA. There is no difference in TEA sensitivity between these two mutants. These data suggest that the outer mouth configuration in the HERG channel differs significantly from that of the Shaker channel so that the side chain at position 631 is shielded from bound TEA. Fig. 3 shows that ErgTx potently suppressed the HERG current amplitude. The suppressing effect could be detected at 1 nm ErgTx. However, ErgTx did not affect Kv1.4, Kv4.3, Kv2.1, or KvLQT1 even at 50 nm. This apparent selectivity, by itself, is not conclusive evidence for a unique outer vestibule structure in the HERG channel among the potassium channels examined here. Therefore, we further investigated the mechanism by which ErgTx suppresses HERG current, and positions in HERG that are important for ErgTx binding. These features are compared with those of ChTx (or its analogs) blockade of the Shaker (or Shaker-like) channel. In the latter cases, the mechanism and site of action of the toxins have been well characterized (16.Goldstein S.A.N. Miller C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1613-1619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22.Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 23.Goldstein S.A.N. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 24.Gross A. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Such a comparison will help us deduce how and where ErgTx binds to the HERG channel and reduces the current. Fig. 4 A illustrates a representative time course of changes in HERG current amplitude when the oocyte was exposed to increasing concentrations of ErgTx (1–100 nm) and after wash out of the toxin. Currents were elicited by repetitive depolarization pulses from V h −80 to +20 mV for 1 s applied once every minute. The peak tail current amplitudes before ErgTx application (Ic) and that at the steady state of ErgTx effect (Itx) were used to measure the fraction of unblocked channels (Itx/Ic). ErgTx suppressed HERG current in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect was totally reversible. The data points can be well fit with Equation 1, Itx/Ic=Amax/(1+[ErgTx]/Kd)+(1−Amax)Equation 1 where A max is the fraction of current sensitive to ErgTx (93 ± 3%), andK d is the dissociation constant (6.45 ± 1.03 nm). It is important to note that there is a residual current (on average ∼10% of control) not suppressed by high concentrations of ErgTx. This is clearly shown in Fig. 4 A: increasing [ErgTx] from 50 to 100 nm induced little further suppression of the current. In the presence of 100 nm ErgTx, the current's waveform resembled that of the control current (showing C-type inactivation and a high K+ selectivity, trace dof Fig. 4 A). Therefore, this cannot be due to an ErgTx-insensitive background or “leak” conductance. Instead, it suggests that ErgTx did not totally occlude the HERG pore. This is different from ChTx blockade of the Shaker channel: Lys-27 of ChTx binds and plugs the channel pore completely (22.Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 23.Goldstein S.A.N. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The difference between ErgTx suppression of HERG and ChTx blockade of Shaker is consistent with the lack of a “Lys-27-equivalent” in the ErgTx sequence (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 4 B also shows that ErgTx potency was not affected by elevating [K]o from 2 to 98 mm. This is distinctly different from the situation of ChTx blockade of the Shaker channel. In this case, Lys-27 of ChTx is critical for Ko sensitivity (16.Goldstein S.A.N. Miller C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1613-1619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22.Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is suggested that Lys-27 of ChTx plugs the potassium channel pore by binding to a site close to K+ binding site within the pore (16.Goldstein S.A.N. Miller C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1613-1619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22.Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Elevating [K]o increases K+ occupancy inside the pore, and the resulting electrostatic repulsion between K+ ions and Lys-27 of ChTx destabilizes toxin binding. The lack of Kosensitivity in ErgTx suppression of HERG is again consistent with the lack of a Lys-27-equivalent residue in ErgTx and with the suggestion that ErgTx does not physically plug the HERG pore. Studies of toxin binding to potassium channels have implicated the S5-P linker (turret of KcsA, Fig. 1 A) and P-S6 linker as important components of toxin binding site (23.Goldstein S.A.N. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 24.Gross A. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis by replacing all residues in the S5-P linker (positions 571–613, 43 residues) and the P-S6 linker (positions 631 to 638, 8 residues) of HERG with cysteine one at a time and studied the resulting effects on current suppression by ErgTx. Out of 51 positions mutated, six mutants were poorly or not expressed (N573C, K595C, P605C, N633C, E637C, and K638C). Of the remaining 45 mutants, the ErgTx potency was evaluated in 98 mm[K]o using the same voltage clamp protocol as shown in Fig. 4 A. One ErgTx concentration (10 nm) was used in all measurements, and the K d values were calculated using the following modified Equation 2,Itx/Ic=0.9/(1+[ErgTx]/Kd)+0.1Equation 2 The assumption is that the maximal effects in all cases were a 90% suppression (Fig. 4). This is valid because WT HERG has an IC50 of 7.2 ± 1.1 nm when estimated using Equation 2 based on data obtained with 10 nm ErgTx, very close to the IC50 determined from the complete concentration-response relationship (6.5 ± 1.0 nm, Fig. 4). The data are summarized in Fig. 5. Most mutants (30 out of 45) showed little or no change in ErgTx binding (changes in binding free energy, ΔΔG, less than 0.5 kcal/mol). Of the remaining 15 mutants, three in the S5-P linker (W585C, G590C, and I593C), and one in the P-S6 linker (P632C) caused outstanding changes in the binding free energy (>2 kcal/mol). For the remaining 11 mutants, the changes in binding free energy were modest although statistically significant (0.5–1 kcal/mol). Fig. 5, top, shows a sequence alignment between Shaker and HERG in the outer vestibule region. We compare the positions known to be important for ChTx (or its analog) binding to Shaker or Shaker-like channels (20.Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R.

https://openalex.org/W2007044047,"Glucose-6-phosphatase confers on gluconeogenic tissues the capacity to release endogenous glucose in blood. The expression of its gene is modulated by nutritional mechanisms dependent on dietary fatty acids, with specific inhibitory effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The presence of consensus binding sites of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) in the −1640/+60 bp region of the rat glucose-6-phosphatase gene has led us to consider the hypothesis that HNF4α could be involved in the regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase gene transcription by long chain fatty acid (LCFA). Our results have shown that the glucose-6-phosphatase promoter activity is specifically inhibited in the presence of PUFA in HepG2 hepatoma cells, whereas saturated LCFA have no effect. In HeLa cells, the glucose-6-phosphatase promoter activity is induced by the co-expression of HNF4α or HNF1α. PUFA repress the promoter activity only in HNF4α-cotransfected HeLa cells, whereas they have no effects on the promoter activity in HNF1α-cotransfected HeLa cells. From gel shift mobility assays, deletion, and mutagenesis experiments, two specific binding sequences have been identified that appear able to account for both transactivation by HNF4α and regulation by LCFA in cells. The binding of HNF4α to its cognate sites is specifically inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acyl coenzyme A in vitro. These data strongly suggest that the mechanism by which PUFA suppress the glucose-6-phosphatase gene transcription involves an inhibition of the binding of HNF4α to its cognate sites in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA thioesters. Glucose-6-phosphatase confers on gluconeogenic tissues the capacity to release endogenous glucose in blood. The expression of its gene is modulated by nutritional mechanisms dependent on dietary fatty acids, with specific inhibitory effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The presence of consensus binding sites of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) in the −1640/+60 bp region of the rat glucose-6-phosphatase gene has led us to consider the hypothesis that HNF4α could be involved in the regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase gene transcription by long chain fatty acid (LCFA). Our results have shown that the glucose-6-phosphatase promoter activity is specifically inhibited in the presence of PUFA in HepG2 hepatoma cells, whereas saturated LCFA have no effect. In HeLa cells, the glucose-6-phosphatase promoter activity is induced by the co-expression of HNF4α or HNF1α. PUFA repress the promoter activity only in HNF4α-cotransfected HeLa cells, whereas they have no effects on the promoter activity in HNF1α-cotransfected HeLa cells. From gel shift mobility assays, deletion, and mutagenesis experiments, two specific binding sequences have been identified that appear able to account for both transactivation by HNF4α and regulation by LCFA in cells. The binding of HNF4α to its cognate sites is specifically inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acyl coenzyme A in vitro. These data strongly suggest that the mechanism by which PUFA suppress the glucose-6-phosphatase gene transcription involves an inhibition of the binding of HNF4α to its cognate sites in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA thioesters. Polyunsaturated fatty acyl coenzyme A suppress the glucose-6-phosphatase promoter activity by modulating the DNA binding of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 278Issue 7PreviewThere is one error repeated several times in the text and in Fig. 7 on pages 15740–15742. In Fig. 7 in columns A and B, 3a should be 3b, 3b should be 3a, 1a+3a should be 1a+3b, and 1a+3b should be 1a+3a. There is no error in the inset of Fig. 7. In the text on pages 15740–15742, 3b should be substituted for 3a, and 3a should be changed to 3b. Hence, it appears that it is site 3b, such as it has been defined in Fig. 6A, which is more crucial than site 3a for the binding of HNF4 and the sensitivity to PUFA (whereas the contrary is published).

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The expression of its gene is increased during diabetes and fasting and normalized upon insulin treatment and refeeding, respectively, in all three gluconeogenic tissues (3Mithieux G. Vidal H.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) has also been strongly suggested to account for increased glucose production and hepatic insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The Glc6Pase gene expression is also modulated by nutritional mechanisms dependent on dietary fatty acids. In the liver of rats, Glc6Pase mRNA and protein contents are increased upon high fat feeding (8Garg M.L. Sabine J.R. Snoswell A.M. Biochem. Int. 1985; 10: 585-595PubMed Google Scholar) and upon elevation in plasma fatty acid levels (9Massillon D. Barzilai N. Hawkins M. Prus-Wertheimer D. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 153-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these nutritional conditions, the suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin is impaired (10Mithieux G. Guignot L. Bordet J.C. Wiernsperger N. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This suggests that a high plasma fatty acid level may contribute increased production of glucose via increased expression of Glc6Pase, resulting in the development of liver insulin resistance (9Massillon D. Barzilai N. Hawkins M. Prus-Wertheimer D. Rossetti L. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 153-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kraegen E.W. Clark P.W. Jenkins A.B. Daley E.A. Chisholm D.J. Storlien L.H.

In vitro, the treatment of fetal hepatocytes with a high concentration (500 μm) of long chain fatty acids (LCFA), such as oleic and linoleic acids, increases the Glc6Pase mRNA content (13Chatelain F. Pegorier J.P. Minassian C. Bruni N. Tarpin S. Girard J. Mithieux G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have shown that the likely mechanism involves a stabilizing effect on Glc6Pase mRNA (13Chatelain F. Pegorier J.P. Minassian C. Bruni N. Tarpin S. Girard J. Mithieux G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in vivo, the presence in high fat diets of substantial amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as that in soybean oil (rich in ω:6 fatty acids) or fish oil (rich in ω:3 fatty acids), does not result in an increase in Glc6Pase activity in rats (8Garg M.L. Sabine J.R. Snoswell A.M. Biochem. Int. 1985; 10: 585-595PubMed Google Scholar, 14Venkatraman J.T. Pehowich D. Singh B. Rajotte R.V. Thomson A.B. Clandinin M.T. Lipids. 1991; 26: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This suggests that among LCFA, PUFA may have specific inhibitory effects on Glc6Pase gene expression. Noteworthy, it is also well known that diets rich in PUFA have only weak deleterious effects on insulin sensitivity, as compared with diets enriched in saturated fat (15Storlien L.H. Kraegen E.W. Chisholm D.J. Ford G.L. Bruce D.G. Pascoe W.S. Science. 1987; 237: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 16Storlien L.H. Jenkins A.B. Chisholm D.J. Pascoe W.S. Khouri S. Kraegen E.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that PUFA may also have opposing effects in regard to hepatic insulin resistance at the level of Glc6Pase activity. Indeed, we have previously shown that PUFA, either added to endoplasmic reticulum membranes or naturally associated to glycogen granules, specifically inhibit the Glc6Pase activity (17Mithieux G. Bordet J.C. Minassian C. Ajzannay A. Mercier I. Riou J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Daniele N. Bordet J.C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 2289-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To date, no molecular mechanism involved in the specific inhibitory effect of PUFA on the Glc6Pase gene expression has been described. In the liver, although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have emerged as an important factor in the fatty acid regulation at the transcription level, recent evidence indicates that the DNA binding activity and/or the abundance of other factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) or hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), may be affected by fatty acids or their metabolites (for reviews, see Refs. 19Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 20Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol.

Interestingly, Hertzet al. (22Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) have recently reported that the transcriptional activity of HNF4α (previously considered an orphan nuclear receptor) could be differentially modulated by LCFA, depending on their unsaturation level, through the binding of their acyl-CoA thioesters to the ligand domain of HNF4α. For example, saturated LCFA such as C16:0 (palmitic acid) might activate the transcriptional activity of HNF4α in cellular transfection assays, and its palmitoyl-CoA derivative might enhance the binding of HNF4α to its DNA-binding site in vitro in bandshift assays. On the contrary, PUFA, such as C18:3(n-3) or C20:5(n-3), might inhibit the transcriptional activity of HNF4α, and their respective acyl-CoA derivatives might decrease the binding of HNF4α to its site. The latter data were obtained using a synthetic promoter containing three copies of the HNF4-binding sequence of the human apoCIII gene regulatory region (22Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, as consensus sequences for the binding of HNF4α are present in the 5′-flanking region of the rat Glc6Pase gene (23Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this has given us, using a natural promoter, the opportunity to examine the original hypotheses: 1) that a differential regulation of Glc6Pase gene expression by saturated and polyunsaturated LCFA could occur at a transcriptional level and 2) that HNF4α might be involved in the mechanism. We studied the effects of LCFA on the Glc6Pase promoter activity in HepG2 hepatoma and HeLa cells. Our results strongly suggest that the Glc6Pase promoter activity is negatively regulated by PUFA through the modulating effect of their CoA-derivatives on HNF4α activity. The 5′-flanking region of the rat Glc6Pase gene up to nucleotide −1640, relative to the transcription start site, was cloned into the “pGL2 basic” vector (Promega) upstream of a luciferase reporter gene and into the “pGL2 enhancer” vector (Promega), which also contains the SV40 enhancer. The −1640/+109 region of the Glc6Pase gene was amplified by PCR from rat genomic DNA using the primers 5′-AAGCTTAAGGTAACTGAGTGAA-3′ sense and 5′-CCAAAGTCGTGGAGCACGTTC-3′ antisense (23Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into the pBluescript SK+ vector to generate the −1640/+109SK+ plasmid. The −1640/+66LUC plasmid was constructed by insertion into pGL2 vector of the SmaI/KpnI fragment obtained by digestion of the −1640/+109SK+ plasmid. A series of truncated Glc6Pase promoter-LUC constructs with progressive 5′-end deletions of the Glc6Pase promoter region was generated by either restriction enzyme or PCR using −1640/+109SK+ plasmid as a template (as denoted in Fig. 1). Site-directed mutagenesis of the HNF4α sequences was generated using the GeneEditorTMin vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) using the antibiotic resistance selection oligonucleotide provided in the kit and specific mutagenic oligonucleotides (denoted in Fig. 7 insets). All PCR-derived constructs and mutations were confirmed by sequencing using the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) to ensure the absence of polymerase errors. Plasmid constructs were purified by the Plasmid Maxi Kit (Jet Star, Genomed).Figure 7Mutations of the HNF4 binding sites 1 and 3 alter the induction by HNF4α and the PUFA inhibition of the Glc6Pase promoter activity. HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with various Glc6Pase promoter-luciferase constructs containing different site-directed mutations of the putative HNF4-binding sites and expression vectors encoding HNF4α and CAT. LUC constructs are drawn on the left, and boxes indicate putative HNF4α binding sites (sites 1–4). Oligonucleotides used for directed mutation are indicated in the insets and compared with the wild type sequence (WT seq.). Incolumn A, LUC activity was determined 48 h after transfection and was normalized relative to the level of CAT activity. The induction by HNF4α of each construct is expressed relative to the induction by HNF4α of the −694/+60E construct. In the column B, LUC activity was determined 6 h after treatment by arachidonic acid (200 μm) and referred to the activity in the cells incubated in the absence of fatty acids (condition with 0.1% EtOH). The results are expressed as percentage of inhibition induced by C20:4. In both columns, the results are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Column A, * and **, significantly different from −694/+60E activity; #, different from mut1a and mut1a + 3b.

The complete medium was refreshed 1 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate transfection method with 1 μg of the Glc6Pase-LUC plasmid, 0.2 μg of pRSV-CAT to correct for transfection efficiency, and 0.5 μg of a HNF4α expression vector pCR3-HNF4 (obtained from M. Raymondjean and B. Viollet (24Viollet B. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4208-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)) or 1 μg of a HNF1 expression vector pRSV-HNF1 (obtained from M. Yaniv (25Chouard T. Blumenfeld M. Bach I. Vandekerckhove J. Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5853-5863Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) as indicated. The total amount of DNA (2.2 μg) was kept constant by the addition of pBluescript SK+ plasmid. For transfection of HepG2 cells, calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitates were formed in Hepes buffer, and for HeLa cells, precipitates were formed in BES buffer (26Ausabel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). The precipitate was removed after 20 h by the addition of EDTA (3.5 mm final) for 1 min, and the cultures were further incubated for another 24 h in normal grown medium. Cells were treated for 6 h by 200 μm fatty acid (Sigma) diluted in ethanol (0.1% final) in the presence of 0.4% bovine serum albumin, in serum-free medium either alone or supplemented with indomethacin (10 μm, Sigma) or NDGA (10 μm, Sigma) or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin, 200 μm, Sigma). In some experiments, treatment was performed for 24 h in the presence of 5 × 10−4m Trolox (Sigma). Cells were treated with indomethacin or NDGA or acetylsalicylic acid for 1 h before adding fatty acid. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). After a 15-min incubation, cells were scraped and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to eliminate cell debris. Luciferase activity was determined with a BCLBook luminometer (Promega) using the Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega). For CAT activity, the cell extract was treated at 60 °C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous deacetylase activity, and CAT activity was determined as described by Newmann et al. (27Newmann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar). The levels of luciferase activities were normalized by means of the CAT activities. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test for unpaired data. Double-stranded oligonucleotides used were described in Fig. 3A. Recombinant HNF4α protein was expressed in Escherichia coli from pRSET-HNF4 (obtained from M. Raymondjean and B. Viollet) and purified as described by Viollet et al. (24Viollet B. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4208-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). End-labeled oligonucleotide probes (0.1 ng, 30,000–50,000 cpm) were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in the binding reaction buffer (10 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6) in the presence of 50 ng of bacterial recombinant HNF4α protein and 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) (24Viollet B. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4208-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 29:1) in 0.2× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. In competition experiments, the competitor DNA was incubated in the mixture prior to the addition of the probe. The antiserum anti-HNF4 used for gel supershifts (28Fourel G. Ringeisen F. Flajolet M. Tronche F. Pontoglio M. Tiollais P. Buendia M.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8571-8583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or purified acyl-CoA (Sigma) were preincubated with proteins at 4 °C for 15 min before the addition of free probe. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried, and the quantification of the DNA binding complexes was monitored using a PhosphorImager and performed using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). 50 μg of whole cell protein extracts from HeLa cells, HeLa cells transfected by pCR3-HNF4 for 48 h, HepG2 cells, or rat liver nuclear extract were separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon membrane. Immunoblotting was performed as described by B. Violletet al. (24Viollet B. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4208-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) using anti-HNF4 antibodies (28Fourel G. Ringeisen F. Flajolet M. Tronche F. Pontoglio M. Tiollais P. Buendia M.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8571-8583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a 1:500 dilution. All Glc6Pase promoter-LUC constructs conferred a significant promoter activity in HepG2 cells but were almost totally inactive in HeLa cells (Fig. 1). In HeLa cells, the addition of an SV40 enhancer was not sufficient to confer significant promoter activity. Indeed, only a weak LUC activity was observed with constructs of the Glc6Pase promoter containing the SV40 enhancer (−1640/+60E to −80/+60E constructs) (see Fig. 3). This strongly suggested that some hepatic specific factors were required for Glc6Pase promoter activity. A promoter fragment from −80 to +60 bp (minimal promoter construct) containing the TATA box was sufficient to confer significant transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1). A strong maximal LUC activity was obtained with a construct containing the −500/+60 bp region of the Glc6Pase promoter. In contrast, the −320/+60B and the −730/+60B constructs presented a lower activity, which was very similar to that of the minimal promoter construct (Fig.1). This suggested that the −320/−500 bp region might contain enhancer elements and that the −500/−730 bp might contain suppressive regulatory elements able to counterbalance the inductive action of the upstream region. Other enhancer regulatory elements might exist within the −1320 to −1480 bp region, since both the −1640/+60B and the −1480/+60B constructs exhibited a similar substantial promoter activity higher than that of the −1320/+60B construct (Fig. 1). HepG2 cells were then transfected with Glc6Pase promoter-LUC constructs, containing either a long (−1320/+60 bp) or a short (−160/+60 bp) promoter fragment, and treated with 200 μmLCFA for 6 h in the presence of 0.4% bovine serum albumin. Saturated (C16:0 and C18:0) and monounsaturated (C18:1(n-9)) had no effect on basal promoter activity (Fig.2A). In contrast, all PUFA studied (e.g. C18:2(n-6), C20:4(n-6), and C22:6(n-3)) suppressed the transcriptional activity of both constructs by 30–50% (Fig. 2A). Experiments carried out with other Glc6Pase promoter constructs of variable lengths yielded very similar results (data not shown). These data strongly suggested that the differential effects of saturated and polyunsaturated LCFA on the Glc6Pase gene expression might occur at a transcriptional level. The suppression of the Glc6Pase promoter activity by PUFA was not affected in the presence of indomethacin (10 μm), NDGA (10 μm), or aspirin (200 μm) (Fig.2B). In a similar manner, the PUFA inhibition effect at a longer time point (24 h) in the presence of the antioxidant agent Trolox (50 μm) was in the same order range as that occurring for a 6-h incubation (Fig. 2C). This allowed us to rule out the hypotheses that the PUFA-inhibitory effects could be dependent either on further metabolism through the cyclooxygenase or lipooxygenase pathways or on the deleterious accumulation of peroxidation products (29Foretz M. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The involvement of HNF1 in the Glc6Pase gene transcription has been previously documented (30Streeper R.S. Eaton E.M. Ebert D.H. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. O'Brien R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9208-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Chapman S. Greenbaum L.E. Taub R. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol.

DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, the involvement of HNF4α has not yet been described. To assess the putative role of the latter, HeLa cells were co-transfected with Glc6Pase promoter-LUC constructs and eucaryotic expression vectors of either HNF4α or HNF1α as a control (Fig.3). In HNF4α-expressing HeLa cells, the Glc6Pase promoter activity was markedly induced by about 10 times from the shortest construct (−80/+60 bp), suggesting the presence of at least one HNF4-binding site in this proximal region. This was in agreement with the presence of a potential HNF4-binding site in this region of the rat Glc6Pase promoter (23Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HNF1α-expressing HeLa cells, the Glc6Pase promoter activity was induced by 3–5 times for the constructs containing the −320/+60 up to the −1640/+60 bp regions (Fig. 3). In contrast, HNF1α did not significantly transactivate the Glc6Pase promoter sequence between −160 to +60 bp (Fig. 3). These results suggested the presence of a first HNF1-binding site localized just upstream the −160 bp of the Glc6Pase promoter. This was in agreement with the presence of HNF1-binding sequence identified between −220 and −210 bp on the mouse, human, and rat Glc6Pase promoters (30Streeper R.S. Eaton E.M. Ebert D.H. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. O'Brien R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9208-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,31Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Chapman S. Greenbaum L.E. Taub R. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11698-11701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The effects of LCFA on the Glc6Pase promoter (−1640/+60 bp) activity were further analyzed in HeLa cells transiently expressing either HNF1α or HNF4α. In HNF4α-expressing HeLa cells, all PUFA (e.g. C18:2(n-6), C18:3(n-3), C20:4(n-6), C20:5(n-3), and C22:6(n-3)) similarly suppressed the HNF4α-induced Glc6Pase promoter activity by about 50% (Fig.4A). In contrast, saturated LCFA (C16:0 and C18:0) had no significant inhibitory effect (Fig.4A). The C18:1(n-9) monounsaturated LCFA had a weak but significant inhibitory action on the Glc6Pase promoter activity (by about 25–30%) (Fig. 4A). In HNF1α-expressing HeLa cells, none among the saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated LCFA had any effect on the HNF1α-induced Glc6Pase promoter activity (Fig. 4A). Similar experiments were performed with Glc6Pase promoter constructs of variable lengths, which yielded comparable results (data not shown; see also Fig. 7B). As in HepG2 cells, the inhibition effect took place in a comparable manner in the presence of indomethacin or NDGA (Fig. 4B) and of Trolox (Fig. 4C). These results strongly suggested that PUFA might suppress the Glc6Pase promoter activity via a specific modulatory action on the HNF4α-induced transactivation. The amount of HNF4α expressed in the different cell models used above was quantitatively analyzed by Western blotting. Noteworthy, HNF4α was expressed in substantial amount in HepG2 cells (Fig.5). In contrast, HNF4α was not detected in HeLa cells, whereas the amount expressed in HeLa cells transfected with pCR3-HNF4α was about 2–2.5 times that in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5). It could be noted that the HNF4α level found in HNF4α-transfected HeLa cells was in the same order range as that present in a rat liver extract analyzed in parallel (Fig. 5). Taken together, the data presented in Figs. 2, 4, and 5 were in keeping with a key role of HNF4α in the PUFA-inhibitory effects on the Glc6Pase promoter activity in both HepG2 and pCR3-HNF4α-transfected HeLa cells. Four potential HNF4α−binding sites could be found in the rat Glc6Pase gene regulatory region using the SignalScan program, at positions +9, −511, −667, and −713 (sites 1–4, respectively) (Ref. 23Argaud D.

The four radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes matching these sites (Fig.6A) were able to bind purified bacterially expressed HNF4α in gel shift mobility assays, and a supershift was obtained in the presence of anti-HNF4 antiserum (Fig.6B). The binding of each probe was competed by the respective unlabeled oligonucleotide and by an oligonucleotide matching the specific HNF4α-binding site of the PEPCK promoter (Fig. 6B). In contrast, an oligonucleotide matching a specific HNF1α-binding site was not able to compete for the binding of each probe to HNF4α (Fig.6B). Among the four potential HNF4α-binding sites of the Glc6Pase promoter, three of them (sites 1, 3, and 4) were able to compete efficiently for the binding of the radiolabeled PEPCK-specific binding site probe to HNF4α (Fig. 6C). The affinity of the binding was lower, however, since at least 500 ng of unlabeled Glc6Pase oligonucleotides were required to obtain the same competition effect as that produced by 100 ng of unlabeled PEPCK oligonucleotide (Fig.6C). These data suggested that HNF4α could bind to at least three specific binding sites (sites 1, 3, and 4) on the Glc6Pase gene promoter. The functional activity of these HNF4 binding sites in the Glc6Pase gene transcription was further characterized via deletion or site-directed mutagenesis as indicated in Fig.7. The −694/+60E construct exhibited the same induction by HNF4α as that of the −730/+60E construct, indicating that the presence of the HNF4α site 4 was not essential for the HNF4α-induced transactivation of the Glc6Pase promoter. The mutation of the single half-site 1a on the −694/+60 fragment decreased the induction by HNF4α by 45%, and the same mutation on the minimal"

PKCα and PKCδ are two PKC isoforms that are expressed at high levels in keratinocytes. In the present study, we examine the effect of PKCδ and PKCα on calcium-dependent keratinocyte differentiation as measured by effects on involucrin (hINV) gene expression. Our studies indicate that calcium increaseshINV promoter activity and endogenous hINV gene expression. This response requires PKCδ, as evidenced by the observation that treatment with dominant-negative PKCδ inhibits calcium-dependent hINV promoter activity, whereas wild type PKCδ increases activity. PKCα, in contrast, inhibits calcium-dependent hINV promoter activation, a finding that is consistent with the ability of dominant-negative PKCα and the PKCα inhibitor, Go6976, to increasehINV gene expression. The calcium-dependent regulatory response is mediated by an AP1 transcription factor-binding site located within the hINV promoter distal regulatory region that is also required for PKCδ-dependent regulation; moreover, both calcium and PKCδ produce similar, but not identical, changes in AP1 factor expression. A key question is whether calcium directly influences PKC isoform function. Our studies show that calcium does not regulate PKCα or δ levels or cause a marked redistribution to membranes. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ is markedly increased following calcium treatment. These findings suggest that PKCα and PKCδ are required for, and modulate, calcium-dependent keratinocyte differentiation in opposing directions.

FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was mixed with KSFM at a final concentration of 3% for 5 min at 25 °C. This mixture (100 μl) was then added to 1 μg of plasmid DNA, incubated for an additional 15 min, and then added dropwise to the cells in dishes containing 2 ml of KSFM.

The supernatant was preabsorbed with 100 μl of Pansorbin for 1 h at 4 °C. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PKCδ or normal mouse IgG (1.5 μg of antibody with 400 μg of protein) was added, and the sample was incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation.

Cells were then incubated for various times in KSFM containing 0.3 mm calcium or 500 nm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The cells were then fixed at 4 °C for 12 h in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 100% methanol for 30 min, blocked in 10% goat serum for 30 min, and incubated for 30 min in primary PKC antibody at a 1:500 dilution in the presence or absence of isoform-specific blocking peptide (PKCδ peptide, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-937P). The sections were then incubated for 30 min with Oregon Green 514-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:500. The coverslips were mounted using Gel Mount Media (Biomedia), and fluorescent images were obtained at 100× using a digital Nikon Optiphot microscope. Keratinocytes were plated in 100-mm dishes at 30% confluence. After attachment the cells were treated with 0.09 or 0.3 mm calcium for 48 h. In a parallel experiment, cells were treated with 8 m.o.i. of empty adenovirus or PKCδ-encoding adenovirus for 48 h. After treatment, the cells were harvested for preparation of nuclear extracts.

We began our studies by confirming that the hINV gene expression is regulated by calcium in our culture system. Keratinocytes were cultured in medium containing 0.09 or 0.3 mm calcium for 48 h, and hINV levels were then monitored by immunoblot. The inset in Fig. 1 A shows that calcium treatment causes a 5-fold increase in endogenous hINV expression. We confirmed this response by examining the effects of calcium onhINV promoter activity.

The activity of the full-lengthhINV promoter construct, pINV-2473, is increased 5-fold by calcium treatment. In contrast, activity of the minimal promoter construct, pINV-41, which encodes only the hINV gene TATA box (32.Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we focused on the PKCδ and PKCα isoforms. We began by studying the role of PKCδ. Keratinocytes were co-transfected with pINV-2473 and PKCδ-encoding vector and then treated with 0.09 or 0.3 mm calcium for 48 h. Cell extracts were then prepared and assayed for hINV promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 2 A, both basal and calcium-stimulated hINV promoter activity is increased by PKCδ. This suggests that cotreatment with calcium and PKCδ can enhance promoter activity but does not indicate whether PKCδ activity is required for the calcium response. To determine whether PKCδ activity is required for calcium regulation, we used a dominant-negative form of PKCδ. In this experiment cells were treated with pINV-2473 and 24 h later with dnPKCδ-encoding virus and then incubated with 0.09 or 0.3 mm calcium for 48 h. Fig. 2 B shows that dnPKCδ nearly completely inhibits the calcium-dependent increase in hINV promoter activity. In contrast, dnPKCδ expression does not alter base-line promoter activity. To confirm that PKCδ and dnPKCδ isoforms are expressed, we treated cells with empty vector (EV) or expression vectors encoding PKCδ or dnPKCδ. Extracts were then prepared for immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 2 C, this analysis confirms that the PKCδ and dnPKCδ expression vectors produce each respective protein in keratinocytes and that these products co-migrate with the endogenous PKCδ. These results suggest that calcium-associated regulation of hINV promoter activity requires PKCδ activity. We next determined whether the endogenous gene displays a similar sensitivity. In Fig. 2 D, cells were incubated with 0.09 (−) or 0.3 mm (+) calcium in the presence of empty vector (EV) or PKCδ-encoding adenovirus. After 48 h, hINV protein levels were measured by immunoblot. Treatment with 0.3 mm calcium or PKCδ causes a 2.5-fold increase in hINV protein level. Stimulation with both 0.3 mm calcium and PKCδ results in a 5.5-fold increase. To determine whether PKCδ activity is required for calcium regulation of endogenous hINV level, we infected keratinocytes with empty vector (EV) or vector encoding dominant-negative PKCδ (dnPKCδ), and then treated with 0.3 mm calcium for 48 h. Fig. 2 E shows that dnPKCδ efficiently inhibited the calcium-dependent increase in endogenous hINV levels. PKCα is a classical PKC isoform that has an important regulatory role in mouse keratinocytes (18.Stanwell C. Denning M.F. Rutberg S.E. Cheng C. Yuspa S.H. Dlugosz A.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 482-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19.Lee Y.S. Dlugosz A.A. McKay R. Dean N.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 18: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKCα influences calcium-dependent regulation of differentiation, we transfected normal keratinocytes with pINV-2473 and increasing concentrations of PKCα expression plasmid and incubated for 48 h in the presence of 0.09 or 0.3 mm calcium. As shown in Fig. 3 A, PKCα causes a concentration-dependent reduction in calcium-dependent promoter activity. To provide additional evidence for this regulation, we used a plasmid encoding the dominant-negative form of PKCα (dnPKCα). Cells were transfected with pINV-2473 in the presence or absence of dnPKCα and then treated for 48 h with high or low calcium. Expression of dnPKCα results in an enhanced calcium-dependent increase in promoter activity (Fig. 3 B). The immunoblot in Fig. 3 B(inset) confirms that the expression vectors produce the appropriate proteins. To determine whether the endogenoushINV gene is regulated in a similar manner, keratinocytes were treated for 48 h in 0.09 or 0.3 mmcalcium-containing medium in the absence or presence of 1 μm Go6976. Go6976 is an inhibitor of classical PKC isoforms, including PKCα (50.Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2104389902,"We describe the isolation, cloning, and characterization of human Nek8, a new mammalian NIMA-related kinase, and its candidate substrate Bicd2. Nek8 was isolated as a β-casein kinase activity in rabbit lung and has an N-terminal catalytic domain homologous to the Nek family of protein kinases. Nek8 also contains a central domain with homology to RCC1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the GTPase Ran, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Like Nek2, Nek8 prefers β-casein over other exogenous substrates, has shared biochemical requirements for kinase activity, and is capable of autophosphorylation and oligomerization. Nek8 activity is not cell cycle regulated, but like Nek3, levels are consistently higher in G0-arrested cells. During the purification of Nek8 a second protein co-chromatographed with Nek8 activity. This protein, Bicd2, is a human homolog of the Drosophila protein Bicaudal D, a coiled-coil protein. Bicd2 is phosphorylated by Nek8in vitro, and the endogenous proteins associate in vivo. Bicd2 localizes to cytoskeletal structures, and its subcellular localization is dependent on microtubule morphology. Treatment of cells with nocodazole leads to dramatic reorganization of Bicd2, and correlates with Nek8 phosphorylation. This may be indicative of a role for Nek8 and Bicd2 associated with cell cycle independent microtubule dynamics."

Two seemingly opposed theories have been proposed: secretion-like coupling (Patterson, R. L., van Rossum, D. B., and Gill, D. L. (1999) Cell 98, 487–499) and the calcium influx factor (CIF) (Randriamampita, C., and Tsien, R. Y. (1993)Nature 364, 809–814). In the current study, a combinatorial approach was taken to investigate the mechanism of CCE in corneal endothelial cells.

Both BN-enhanced CCE and the 5,6-EET-induced Ca2+ entry were inhibited by the CCE blocker 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, indicating a role for cytochrome P-450s in CCE. Treatment with calyculin A (CalyA), which causes condensation of cortical cytoskeleton, inhibited CCE. The actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D partially reversed the inhibition of CCE by CalyA, suggesting a secretion-like coupling mechanism for CCE. However, CalyA could not inhibit CCE in BN-treated cells, and 5,6-EET caused a partial activation of CCE in CalyA-treated cells. These results further support the notion that cytochrome P-450 metabolites may be CIFs. The vesicular transport inhibitor brefeldin A inhibited CCE in both vehicle- and BN-treated cells. Surprisingly, Sr2+ entry in the absence of store depletion was enhanced in BN-treated cells, which was also inhibited by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate.

A wide variety of ligands initiate responses through the process of calcium signaling (1.Berridge M. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref Scopus (4419) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced generation of intracellular calcium signaling involves generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3inositol trisphosphate2-APBaminoethoxydiphenyl borateBFAbrefeldin ABNβ-naphthoflavoneCalyAcalyculin ACCEcapacitative calcium entryCIFcalcium influx factorCPAcyclopiazonic acidCytDcytochalasin DEETepoxyeicosatrienoic acidERendoplasmic reticulumIP3RIP3receptor(s)PMplasma membraneRyRryanodine receptorSERCAsarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPaseSOCstore-operated Ca2+ channelTRPtransient receptor potentialAAarachidonic acid(s)1The abbreviations used are: IP3inositol trisphosphate2-APBaminoethoxydiphenyl borateBFAbrefeldin ABNβ-naphthoflavoneCalyAcalyculin ACCEcapacitative calcium entryCIFcalcium influx factorCPAcyclopiazonic acidCytDcytochalasin DEETepoxyeicosatrienoic acidERendoplasmic reticulumIP3RIP3receptor(s)PMplasma membraneRyRryanodine receptorSERCAsarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPaseSOCstore-operated Ca2+ channelTRPtransient receptor potentialAAarachidonic acid(s) and diacylglycerol by phospholipase C. The binding of IP3 to IP3 receptors (IP3R), which are located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activates the intrinsic Ca2+ channel and releases Ca2+ from the ER (the Ca2+ stores) into the cytosol. The release of Ca2+ is closely followed by entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the cytoplasm across the plasma membrane (PM). This process is called “capacitative calcium entry” (CCE) or “store-operated calcium entry” (2.Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 3.Parekh A.B.

The signal for activation of PM Ca2+ channels, termed store-operated Ca2+channels (SOC), appears to be the depletion of the ER Ca2+stores. CCE can be alternatively induced by emptying the Ca2+ store with the use of inhibitors of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), which actively transports Ca2+ from the cytosol into the ER (3.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol.

Recently, homologues ofDrosophila transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been postulated to be SOCs (5.Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L.

The conformational coupling model, suggesting that IP3Rs activate SOCs/TRPs, was recently favored (7.Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S.

However, this model was challenged by the finding that cells lacking IP3R have normal SOC activity (13.Broad L.M. Braun F.-J. Lievremont J.-P. Bird G.S.J. Kurosaki T. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

Interventions. 2001; 1: 84-94PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, a secretion-like coupling model was put forward based on the fact that reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton modulates CCE (19.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Formation of a tight actin layer subjacent to the PM displaces the cortical ER and inhibits CCE, whereas CCE is not affected by whole cell actin disassembly. The secretion-like coupling model was further supported by a study in Xenopus oocytes, showing that SNAP-25, a component of the vesicle fusion machinery, is required for CCE (20.Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, the secretion-like coupling model was also challenged by a study on the rat basophilic cell line (21.Bakowski D. Glitsch M.D. Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 532: 55-71Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar), showing that none of the maneuvers that alter the actin cytoskeleton affectsI crac, the best characterized store-operated Ca2+ current. It seems that different cells may possess distinct mechanisms for CCE. A seemingly opposed model suggests that store depletion causes release of a soluble factor called calcium influx factor (CIF), which activates SOCs in the PM. Extraction of CIFs has been documented by several groups (22.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 23.Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A.

However, the chemical nature of CIFs has not been resolved. Cytochrome P-450 metabolites have been proposed to act as CIFs based on the finding that cytochrome P-450 inhibitors inhibit CCE (25.Alonso M.T. Alvarez J. Montero M. Sanchez A. Garcia-Sancho J.

Several recent studies provided more evidence for the role of cytochrome P-450s in CCE (29.Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Hoffman S.W. Falck J.R. Ellis E.F. J. Biol.

The corneal endothelium is a monolayer of cells located at the posterior surface of the cornea. This cell layer plays a critical role in regulating the hydration and transparency of the cornea. Ion and fluid transport by the corneal endothelium control the connective tissue (stroma) hydration (33.Maurice D.M. Giardini A.A. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1951; 35: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34.Sun X.C. Bonanno J.A. Jelamskii S. Xie Q. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1648-C1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In corneal endothelial cells, purinergic agonists and the SERCA inhibitor CPA induce CCE (35.Srinivas S.P. Yeh J.C. Ong A. Bonanno J.A. Curr.

Bonanno, unpublished observation.2Y. Zhang, Q. Xie, and J. A. Bonanno, unpublished observation. which is essential for the transparency of the cornea. In the current study, the secretion-like coupling and CIF models were examined using a combinatorial approach in corneal endothelial cells. The CCE blocker 2-APB inhibited both β-naphthoflavone (BN)-enhanced CCE and 5,6-EET-induced [Ca2+]i elevation, indicating that cytochrome P-450 metabolites of arachidonic acids (AA) may be CIFs. Treatment with calyculin A (CalyA) inhibited CCE, which was partially reversed by cytochalasin D, suggesting a secretion-like coupling mechanism for CCE. However, CalyA had no effect on BN-enhanced CCE. The vesicular transport inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) inhibited CCE in both vehicle- and BN-treated cells. Surprisingly, Sr2+entry without store depletion was enhanced in BN-treated cells, which was inhibitable by 2-APB. These results suggest that both the secretion-like coupling and CIF mechanisms play roles in CCE. An integrative model of CCE is discussed. Bovine corneal endothelial cells were cultured to confluence on glass coverslips. Briefly, primary cultures from fresh cow eyes were established in T-25 flasks in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% bovine calf serum with antibiotic antimycotic agents (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml fungizone); gassed with 5% CO2-95% air at 37 °C; and fed every 2–3 days. These cells were subcultured to coverslips. The cells were transferred to 0.5% serum with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for at least 12 h before experiments. The composition of Ca2+-rich Ringer solution was 157.7 mmNa+, 4 mm K+, 0.61 mmMg2+, 1.4 mm Ca2+, 151.02 mm Cl−, 1 mmHPO42−, 10 mm HEPES, 12.7 mm gluconate−, and 5 mm glucose. Ca2+-free solution was composed of 157.7 mmNa+, 4 mm K+, 0.61 mmMg2+, 148.22 mm Cl−, 1 mm HPO42−, 10 mm HEPES, 12.7 mm gluconate−, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm glucose. Sr2+solution was made by replacing Ca2+ with Sr2+in Ca2+-rich solution. For all solutions, the osmolarity was adjusted to 300 ± 5 mOsm with sucrose, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cell culture supplies were obtained from Invitrogen. Calyculin A was purchased from LC Labs (Woburn, MA). 5,6-EET was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). 5,6-EET was prepared in the same manner as the manufacturer's protocol and as described by Rzigalinskiet al. (29.Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Hoffman S.W. Falck J.R. Ellis E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 175-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 2-APB and brefeldin A were obtained fromCalbiochem (San Diego, CA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Stock solutions of the above chemicals were stored desiccated at −20 °C. Intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i) was measured with Fura-2, a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye. The cells on coverslips were loaded with Fura-2 by incubation in Ca2+-rich Ringer containing 5 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at room temperature. Then cells were washed for 45 min in Ca2+-rich Ringer without Fura-2. The coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber designed for an inverted microscope (Diaphot; Nikon). Ca2+ measurements were done at room temperature using a microscope fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). Fura-2 was excited at 340 and 380 nm, whereas fluorescence emission was monitored at 505 nm. Ca2+ measurements are shown as 340/380 nm ratios obtained from groups of 10–15 cells. CCE was studied by two protocols: 1) for Ca2+-rich protocol, CPA was applied in Ca2+-rich solution; the sustained [Ca2+]i elevations after 10-min applications of CPA were used as relative levels of CCE (see Fig. 2 A) (36.Singh B.B.

After allowing the [Ca2+]i to peak and then decrease to a steady-state level (normally 6–10 min for ATP and 12–15 min for CPA), 1.4 mm Sr2+ was introduced. Because Sr2+ acts similar to Ca2+ in interactions with Fura-2 (38.Schilling W. Rajan L. Strobl-Jager E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12838-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Kwan C.Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 678-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used Sr2+ entry as a quantitative measurement of CCE. Intracellular Ca2+ release,i.e. the Ca2+ store size, was assayed by the peak elevation of fluorescence ratios after application of ATP or CPA in Ca2+-free medium (a Ca2+-free protocol, as seen in Fig. 2 B) (36.Singh B.B.

SPSS (Chicago, IL) software was used for statistical analysis. Student's t test was used to analyze most of the data, except a two-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the difference between the increase of Sr2+entry after store depletion and the increase of basal Sr2+entry in BN-treated cells; p < 0.05 was considered significant. The means and standard errors are shown in all inset histographs in the figures. Although originally recognized as an IP3R inhibitor, 2-APB has recently been shown to block the CCE pathway independent of the IP3R (13.Broad L.M. Braun F.-J. Lievremont J.-P. Bird G.S.J. Kurosaki T.

To determine whether cytochrome P-450 metabolites are involved in the activation of SOCs in corneal endothelial cells, we first examined whether enhancement of CCE by the cytochrome P-450 inducer BN could be inhibited by the CCE blocker 2-APB. BN is a well known cytochrome P-450 inducer in vascular endothelium (30.Graier W. Simecek S. Sturek M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 259-274Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 48.Pinto A. Abraham N.G. Mullane K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 236: 445-451PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of cytochrome P-450s by BN potentiated agonist-induced Ca2+ and Mn2+ influx in cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical veins, whereas intracellular Ca2+ release remained unchanged (30.Graier W. Simecek S. Sturek M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 259-274Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Similarly, BN did not affect agonist-induced intracellular Ca2+ release or base-line fluorescence ratio in corneal endothelial cells (data not shown). Fig. 1 A shows that after store depletion by ATP in the absence of Ca2+, we observed robust Sr2+ entry in BN-treated cells, significantly greater than that in vehicle-treated cells using the Sr2+ add-back protocol. BN also enhanced Ca2+ entry after store depletion using the Ca2+ add-back protocol (data not shown). Fig. 1 A shows that 2-APB significantly inhibited Sr2+entry in vehicle-treated cells. Interestingly, 2-APB also inhibited Sr2+ entry in BN-treated cells to the same level as in vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1 A, inset, compareCon + 2-APB with BN + 2-APB; p > 0.33). Additionally, less selective CCE blockers La3+ (100 μm) and SKF 96365 (50 μm) completely blocked Sr2+ entry in both vehicle- and BN-treated cells (data not shown), further supporting the role of BN-induced cytochrome P-450 activity in CCE. 5,6-EET, one of the products of cytochrome P-450 metabolism of AA, has been proposed to be a CIF in vascular endothelial cells and astrocytes (29.Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Hoffman S.W. Falck J.R. Ellis E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 175-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30.Graier W. Simecek S. Sturek M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 259-274Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). 5,6-EET-activated Ca2+ channels were also permeable to Mn2+ and Ba2+ and sensitive to Ni2+ and La3+, characteristics of SOCs (30.Graier W. Simecek S. Sturek M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 259-274Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1 B, we tested whether 5,6-EET could induce Ca2+ entry in the absence of store depletion. Although the vehicle had no effect (not shown), 5,6-EET caused a small but significant [Ca2+]i elevation in Ca2+-rich medium. In Ca2+-free medium, 5,6-EET did not affect [Ca2+]i (not shown), indicating that 5,6-EET acts on Ca2+ entry but not Ca2+release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores (29.Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Hoffman S.W. Falck J.R. Ellis E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 175-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30.Graier W. Simecek S. Sturek M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 259-274Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To test whether 5,6-EET was activating SOCs, we examined the effects of the CCE blocker 2-APB on 5,6-EET-induced [Ca2+]ielevation. Because 2-APB alone could partially release the Ca2+ store and increase [Ca2+]i3 (43.Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 49.Gregory R.B. Rychkov G. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 50.Missiaen L. Callewaert G. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we pretreated cells with 2-APB until the traces became steady, usually for 5 min, before 5,6-EET was introduced. Consistent with the results on BN-enhanced Sr2+ entry, 2-APB significantly inhibited 5,6-EET-induced Ca2+ entry (Fig. 1 B). Thus, both BN-enhanced CCE and 5,6-EET-induced Ca2+ entry were inhibited by 2-APB, indicating that cytochrome P-450 metabolites may be the chemical messengers for CCE. The elevation of [Ca2+]i caused by 5,6-EET is smaller than that caused by CPA (Fig. 2 A). One possible reason is the labile nature of 5,6-EET. Another possibility is that 5,6-EET may be just one of the metabolites that activate SOC and that the full activation of CCE needs multiple cytochrome P-450 metabolites. In contrast to the CIF model for CCE, a seemingly opposed model suggests that a secretion-like coupling mechanism is required for the activation of SOCs (19.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The primary evidence for the secretion-like coupling model was the observation that manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton could modulate CCE. However, these two models may not be mutually exclusive if the key protein/enzyme producing CIFs needs to be “secreted” in the proximity of the PM to exert their effects, especially if the CIFs are ephemeral. To explore this possibility, we first attempted to test whether a secretion-like coupling mechanism exists in corneal endothelial cells. The effects of rearranging the actin cytoskeleton on CCE were examined using cytochalasin D (CytD), which inhibits actin polymerization (51.Fox J.E. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1981; 292: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and CalyA, which induces translocation of actin to the subplasmalemmal region (19.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L.

https://openalex.org/W1969041583,"Arrestin2 binding to the active but unphosphorylated luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LH/CG R) in ovarian follicles is triggered by activation of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and leads to uncoupling of this receptor from cAMP signaling. We sought to determine how arrestin2 binds to LH/CG R, if binding is of high affinity, and if the receptor also binds arrestin3. Desensitization of intact LH/CG R was equally sensitive to ectopic constructs of arrestin2 that bind other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) either in a phosphorylation-independent or -dependent manner. Intact LH/CG R was not desensitized by ectopic arrestin3 constructs. Surface plasmon resonance studies showed that arrestin2 bound a synthetic third intracellular (3i) LH/CG R loop peptide with picomolar affinity; arrestin3 bound with millimolar affinity. To determine whether Asp-564 in the 3i loop mimicked the phosphorylated residue of other GPCRs, human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) and D564G LH/CG R. An agonist-stimulated ARF6-dependent arrestin2 undocking pathway to drive desensitization of WT receptor was recapitulated in HEK cell membranes, and ectopic arrestin2 promoted desensitization of WT LH/CG R. However, D564G LH/CG R in HEK cells was not desensitized, and synthetic 3i D564G peptide did not bind arrestin2. Synthetic 3i loop peptides containing D564E, D564V, or D564N also did not bind arrestin2. We conclude that the ARF6-mediated mechanism to release a pool of membrane-delimited arrestin to bind GPCRs may be a widespread mechanism to deliver arrestin to GPCRs for receptor desensitization. Unlike other GPCRs that additionally require receptor phosphorylation, LH/CG R activation is sufficient to expose a conformation in which Asp-564 in the 3i loop confers high affinity binding selectively to arrestin2.

Signaling by the receptor regulates spermatogenesis and puberty in males and final follicular maturation, ovulation, and progesterone production by corpora lutea in females. Following activation of the LH/CG R by LH or hCG and resulting activation predominately of stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gs) and adenylyl cyclase (AC), like most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), signaling to G protein-regulated effectors declines or becomes desensitized (1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). Desensitization of prototypical β2-adrenergic receptor and rhodopsin occurs by a two-step mechanism. First the receptor becomes phosphorylated by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) (2Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). That receptor phosphorylation is obligatory for desensitization is evidenced by GRK1 (3Chen C.K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The second step in receptor desensitization is the binding of arrestin to the active phosphoreceptor (5Lohse M.J. Andexinger S. Pitcher J. Trukawinski S. Codina J. Faure J.-P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8558-8564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity binding of arrestin is achieved by engagement of two binding sites on arrestin, one that recognizes the active receptor conformation and a second site that interacts directly with the GRK-phosphorylated residue on the receptor (6Kovoor A.

GPCR phosphorylation is therefore believed to be obligatory for high affinity arrestin binding to active receptor. Arrestin functions in desensitization to sterically hinder the ability of the receptor to interact with its cognate G protein (9Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

The arrestins are a conserved family of proteins consisting of the visual arrestins (arrestin1 and arrestin4) localized to rod and cone cells, respectively, and the ubiquitous arrestin2 (β-arrestin1) and arrestin3 (β-arrestin 2) (10Palczewski K.

This membrane-delimited arrestin2 is released from a putative docking site by a GTP-dependent reaction requiring the activation of the small G protein ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) (12Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The liberated arrestin2 then binds to the third intracellular (3i) loop of active LH/CG R, resulting in the uncoupling of the receptor from Gs (13Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12984-12989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based in part on the ability of neutralizing arrestin antibodies to prevent agonist-dependent desensitization (11Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Banga J.P. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the ability of a synthetic 3i loop peptide to compete with receptor for endogenous arrestin and block desensitization (13Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12984-12989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, for the LH/CG R, like many other GPCRs, desensitization requires the obligatory binding of an arrestin. The LH/CG R, like many GPCRs, is phosphorylated in its cytoplasmic tail upon agonist activation (14Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar,15Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to most GPCRs, phosphorylation of the LH/CG R is not obligatory for desensitization. This conclusion is based (a) in a porcine follicular membrane model on the inability of protein kinase inhibitors to block LH/CG R desensitization (16Lamm M.L.G. Ekstrom R.C. Maizels E.T.

Therefore we sought to compare the extent of desensitization of both the porcine LH/CG R in follicular membranes (a homologous cell background) and the murine LH/CG R stably transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (a heterologous cell background) promoted by ectopic constructs of arrestins, which bind to the β2-adrenergic receptor and rhodopsin either in a constitutively active, phosphorylation-independent or a phosphorylation-dependent manner (6Kovoor A.

We found that desensitization of both LH/CG Rs in homologous versus heterologous cell backgrounds was equally sensitive to constructs of visual arrestin1 and arrestin2 that bound to other GPCRs in either a phosphorylation-dependent or constitutively active/phosphorylation-independent manner but insensitive to arrestin3. Mutation of Asp-564 to Gly in the 3i loop of the LH/CG R prevented arrestin2 binding and desensitization. Synthetic 3i loop peptides in which Asp-564 was changed to the similarly charged Glu, to Asn, which exhibits similar hydrogen bonding capability but is uncharged, or to nonpolar Val did not compete with the receptor to bind arrestin2. However, a peptide in which the other negatively charged residue in the 3i loop, Glu-557, was changed to Gly retained its ability to bind arrestin2 and blocked desensitization. The specific geometry of Asp-564 is therefore crucial for arrestin2 binding to the active LH/CG R to promote desensitization. Recombinant arrestins were overexpressed in BL-21 cells and purified (25Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol.

Synthetic peptides corresponding to the 3i loop of the LH/CG R (FAVQNPELMATNKDTKIAKK), 3i D564G(FAVQNPELMATNK-G TKIAKK), 3i D564V(FAVQNPELMATNKV TKIAKK), 3i D564N(FAVQNPELMATNKN TKIAKK), 3i D564E(FAVQNPELMATNKE TKIAKK), and 3i E557G(FAVQNPG LMATNKDTKIAKK) were synthesized and purified to ∼95% purity by high pressure liquid chromatography by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX).

Synthetic LH/CG R peptides were immobilized to carboxymethyl CM5 BIAcore™ chips (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Surface plasmon resonance was performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Amersham Biosciences). For binding to immobilized LH/CG R 3i peptides, recombinant arrestins were diluted in 10 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.05% surfactant p20 and injected at 10 μl/min. Kinetic parameters were studied in buffer flow for 6 min. Kd values were calculated with BIAevaluationTM software. Fitted curves showing statistically significant binding had a χ2 of <7.5.Figure 1Porcine follicular LH/CG R desensitization is stimulated by visual arrestin1 and arrestin2 but not by arrestin3. Porcine follicular membranes were preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min with the indicated final concentrations of recombinant arrestins or water. In panels A, B, and C and as depicted in the schematic diagram, membranes were then subjected to a two-stage desensitization reaction at 30 °C (50-μl total volume). The stage 1 reaction was conducted in the presence of 8% ethanol, 25 mm BTP, pH 7.2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 μm GTP, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm [3H]cAMP (∼20,000 cpm)) and in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml BSA or hCG as indicated.

Results are means ± S.E. of quadruplicate determinations for a single assay and are representative of three separate assays. The hatched region in panel A reflects the S.E. of maximal hCG-stimulated AC activity. The asterisk indicates that the difference between maximal hCG-stimulated AC activities (solid bar) and desensitized activities are significantly different (p< 0.05). The percent desensitization of LH/CG R was calculated as the percent reduction by receptor agonist or ectopic arrestin of maximal hCG-stimulated AC activity minus basal AC activity. For panels B and C, the open bar reflects basal AC activity when the preincubation contained no exogenous arrestins. The solid bar reflects maximal hCG-stimulated AC activity when the preincubation contained no exogenous arrestins, when BSA was present in stage 1, and when hCG was present in stage 2. The solid symbols reflect AC activity when the preincubation contained the indicated concentrations of ectopic arrestins, when BSA was present in stage 1, and when hCG was present in stage 2. Results are means ± S.E. of quadruplicate determinations for a single assay and are representative of three separate assays. Dotted lines indicate 50% inhibition of maximal hCG-stimulated AC activity above basal AC activity (i.e. ((hCG-stimulated AC activity) − (basal AC activity)/2 + (basal AC activity))). In panel D, 300 μg of follicular membrane protein were incubated in a stage 1 incubation, as described above, in the presence of BSA or hCG, membrane proteins were solubilized in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (73Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M.

When receptor agonist is present only during the 5-min AC assay (stage 2), maximal LH/CG R-stimulated AC activity is detected (Table I and Fig. 1 A, bar 2). LH/CG R desensitization occurs when receptor agonist is added to the stage 1 reaction and is detected as a reduction in maximal hCG-stimulated AC activity (Table I and Fig. 1 A, bar 3). Basal AC activity is measured when receptor agonist is omitted from stages 1 and 2. We previously showed that agonist-dependent LH/CG R desensitization results from the agonist-dependent undocking of membrane-delimited arrestin2 (11Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12984-12989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we initially evaluated the ability of ectopic WT arrestins to promote LH/CG R desensitization of the intact LH/CG R in porcine ovarian follicular membranes when agonist was now omitted from the stage 1 incubation. To this end, follicular membranes were preincubated (30 min at 4 °C, see Fig. 1 A, inset) without ectopic arrestins (Fig. 1 A, bars 1–3) or with 40 nm ectopic WT arrestins (bars 4–6). For membranes incubated without ectopic arrestins, basal and maximal LH/CG R-stimulated AC activities are represented by bars 1 and 2 in Fig. 1 A, and agonist-stimulated LH/CG R desensitization mediated by endogenous arrestin is represented by bar 3 of Fig. 1 A. For membranes preincubated with ectopic WT arrestins, membranes were subjected to the stage 1 reaction (30 min at 30 °C) conducted in the absence of hCG followed by a 5-min AC assay (stage 2) conducted in the presence of hCG. Ectopic WT visual arrestin1 and arrestin2 (Fig. 1 A, bars 4 and 5) evoked desensitization of hCG-stimulated AC activity, evidenced as a reduction in maximal hCG-stimulated AC activity, while arrestin3 was unable to promote LH/CG R desensitization, consistent with our earlier report (11Mukherjee S.

Thus, the addition of ectopic WT visual arrestin1 or arrestin2 to the preincubation reaction bypasses the requirement for agonist in stage 1 (which causes undocking of endogenous arrestin; Refs. 12Mukherjee S.

We further evaluated the efficacy of ectopic WT arrestins to promote desensitization of the intact LH/CG R in follicular membranes. Results in Fig. 1 B show that a 50% reduction in maximal LH/CG R-stimulated AC activities was achieved with ∼10 pm visual arrestin1 and arrestin2, consistent with high affinity binding of these arrestins to the intact LH/CG R in follicular membranes.

Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Increased levels of GD3 have also been associated with proliferative diseases like atherosclerosis (9.Mukhin D. Chao F.F. Kruth H.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10.Chatterjee S. Dey S. Shi W.Y. Thomas K. Hutchins G.M. Glycobiology. 1996; 7: 57-65Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the endogenous expression of GD3 synthase leads to proliferation of PC12 cells through the Ras-MAPK pathway (11.Fukumoto S. Mutoh T. Hasegawa T. Miyazaki H. Okada M. Goto G. Furukawa K. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5832-5837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the overexpression of GD3 synthase leads to an increased level of GD3 that in turn contributes to apoptosis in human leukemic cells (12.Maria R.D. Lenti L. Malisan d'Agostion F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In addition, studies suggest that GD3 mediates TNF-α- and Fas/Apo-1/CD-95-induced apoptosis in such cells. Collectively, these studies imply that GD3 might have a dual role in modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the signaling mechanisms involved in this phenomenon have not been evaluated. We rationalized that because cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells and normal human aorta contain a significant amount of GD3, it may well be implicated in proliferation. On the other hand a marked increase in the level of GD3 in human plaque from patients with atheroscleosis may contribute to plaque instability via inducing apoptosis. glycosphingolipid mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate N-acetylcysteine nitric oxide reactive oxygen species aortic smooth muscle cell N G-monomethyl-l-arginine reduced glutathione tumor necrosis factor 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate d-threo-l-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol glycosphingolipid mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate N-acetylcysteine nitric oxide reactive oxygen species aortic smooth muscle cell N G-monomethyl-l-arginine reduced glutathione tumor necrosis factor 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate d-threo-l-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are usually generated in response to diverse external stimuli, such as TNF-α, TGF-β, PDGF, EGF (13.Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 39-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and lipid second messengers, e.g. lysophosphadic acid (14.Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar) and lactosylceramide (15.Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At low concentrations ROS may play the role of an intracellular messenger of various molecular events (16.McCord J.M. Clin. Biochem. 1993; 26: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), including cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the generation of large amounts of ROS is considered cytotoxic and contributes to apoptosis. ROS represents multiple molecular species, including singlet oxygen, superoxides (O2⨪), H2O2, NO, peroxynitrite (ONOO−), the thiperoxyradical (RSOO⋅), and the hydroxyl radical (HO⋅). Superoxides are the early molecular species of ROS that are generated as a consequence of the interaction of cells with external stimuli that in turn generate H202, HO⋅, etc. The generation of ROS has been related to the activation of transcriptional factors, for example, AP-1, NFκB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (p44 MAPK) implicated in cell proliferation. On the other hand, NO as well as the generation of high levels of O2⨪ activate caspases that in turn lead to the dissolution of the cell membrane and nuclear components resulting in apoptosis. Collectively, these studies and our own (15.Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16.McCord J.M. Clin.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that GD3 may well recruit ROS to induce cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this paper, we report that exogenously supplied [3H]GD3 associates with the cell membrane mainly in a trypsin-sensitive state. Subsequently, it recruits ROS's such as O2⨪ and NO as biological sensors that serve a dual role in cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively, in aortic smooth muscle cells (A-SMC). Because GD3 is a major GSL in normal A-SMC, and its level is markedly increased in human aortic plaque intima (8.Nakano J. Mohan-Raj B.K. Asagami C. Lloyd K.O. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), our findings may be relevant to the pathological sequalae including the progression of atherosclerosis via A-SMC proliferation and the apoptosis of A-SMC that may contribute to plaque rupture. [3H]Thymidine and [γ-32P]ATP (222 TBq/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Bovine milk GD3 was purchased from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA) and labeled with 3H, employing palladium-catalyzed reduction of the sphingosine double bond (18.Schwarzmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). [3H]GD3 was purified further by chromatography in silica gel Lichro prep Si60 (E. Merck, AG Darmstadt, Germany) with choloroform/methanol/water (60:40:9, v/v). The specific activity of the [3H]GD3 was 147.9 MBq/μmol. A stock solution of GD3 was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and suitable aliquots added to the culture dishes. Anti-MAPK antibody (specific for p44 MAPK and p42 MAPK), and MAPK-specific substrate peptides (APRTPGGRR), were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-cytochromec antibody was obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). The DNA isolation kit was purchased form Qiagen Inc. GSL and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Human aortic smooth muscle cells were prepared and cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (50 μg/ml) according to the procedure of Ross (19.Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of gangliosides were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and added to cultured cells to achieve the final desired concentrations of gangliosides. The maximum concentration of Me2SO exposed to cells was <0.01%, and cells that were incubated with 0.01% Me2SO served as a control. The incorporation of [3H]GD3 into human aortic smooth muscle cells was carried out exactly as described by Sonderfeld et al. (20.Sonderfeld S. Conzelmann E. Schwarzmann G. Hinrichs U. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayer of aortic smooth muscle cells were incubated in minimum essential medium containing 0.3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 200 nmol of [3H]GD3. At 1-, 2.5-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-min time intervals medium was removed, and the monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Total radioactivity in the washed cell pellets was measured by scintillation spectrometry using Aquasol-II as the scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Next the cells were harvested following trypsinization (0.25% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C and centrifuged (1,000 × g for 5 min, 4 °C). The cell pellets were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and radioactivity associated with the cells was measured by scintillation spectrometry. Lucigenin, an acridylium compound (Sigma) that emits light on reduction and interaction with O2⨪, was used to measure the level of O2⨪ production (15.Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Cultured A-SMC was harvested, and the superoxide was measured in intact cell suspensions as described previously using dark-adapted lucigenin (500 μm) in a balanced salt solution (15.Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The viability of the suspended cells as determined by the trypan blue exclusion principle was >90%. The ganglioside solutions (dissolved in Me2SO) were added to the cells to achieve a final concentration of Me2SO that was equal to 0.01%. Moreover, the vehicle (0.01% Me2SO) served as a control in most experiments. Confluent human A-SMC was incubated with 5 μm GD3. At different time intervals cells were harvested and homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The membrane (both plasma membrane and mitochondrial) and cytosol were prepared by the centrifugation of the cell homogenate at 29,100 × g for 20 min at 4 °C (15.Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The membrane was resuspended in an original volume of lysis buffer. NADH and NADPH oxidase activity was measured in both cytosolic and membrane fraction as described previously by the lucigenin chemiluminescence method (15.Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) using 250 μm lucigenin as the electron acceptor and either 100 μm NADPH or 100 μm NADH as an electron donor. In some experiments, NADPH oxidase activity was measured in the membrane preparations in the presence of 1 mm rotenone (mitochondrial poison). The protein content was measured by the Lowry et al. (21.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) method with bovine serum albumin serving as the standard. A-SMC was lyzed in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, and Nonidet P-40. The lysate was centrifuged and immunoprecipitated with the anti-MAP kinase antibody conjugated with agarose as described earlier (22.Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10660-10666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Immunocomplex was directly used for MAP kinase activity assay (22.Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10660-10666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μl of total reaction mixture contained 1 mg/ml myelin basic protein peptide (APRTPGGRR), 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1,800 cpm/pmol), 0.5 mmadenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, and assay dilution buffer containing 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, and 2–3 μg of immunoprecipitated protein. The reaction was initiated upon the addition of [γ-32P] ATP for 15 min at 30 °C and terminated with the addition of 10 μl of ice-cold 40% trichloroacetic acid. One part of the reaction mixture was spotted onto p81 phosphocellulose paper. Free [γ-32P]ATP was removed by five washes (5 min each) with 1% phosphoric acid and counted in a scintillation counter. The remaining part of the reaction mixture was run into 15% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed. Cells were treated with various agonists and antagonists for 12 h, and the DNA was isolated and analyzed by DNA electrophoresis as described earlier (23.Selins K.S. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3199-3206PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation with agonists, cells were washed, harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 mm sucrose (24.Zhang P. Liu B. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Rhee S.G. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30615-30618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Cytosol was prepared, and the level of cytosolic cytochrome c was determined by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody. Nitrite production, a stable product of NO, was measured by the Griess reagent as described previously (25.Khan B.V. Harrison D.G. Olbrych M.T. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9114-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with the agonist and antagonists. At the end of incubation, 500 μl of culture medium was mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent (1 part of 1% sulfanilamide in 2.5% phosphoric acid and 1 part of 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride). The colorimetric absorbance at 550 nm was measured, and the nitrite concentration was determined using a standard curve generated using sodium nitrite. As shown in Fig. 1 (top panel), total incorporation of [3H]GD3 into human aortic smooth muscle cells occurred very rapidly during the 30-min duration of this study. However, very little radioactivity remained associated with the cells following trypsinization of cells (Fig. 1, bottom panel). GD3 (10 μm) stimulated the level of O2⨪ generation about 5-fold as compared with the control (Fig. 2). Other gangliosides like, GM1, GM2, and globotriosylceramide did not alter the O2⨪ level in these cells. LacCer also stimulated O2⨪ generation about 7-fold higher than the control and served as a positive control. On the other hand, GM3 decreased O2⨪ generation. GD3 stimulated the generation of O2⨪ in H-ASMC in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). The maximum stimulation of O2⨪ (∼5-fold) was observed using (10 μm) GD3 (Fig. 2 A), but at a relatively higher concentration of GD3 (50–200 μm) the level of O2⨪ was below the base-line value (Fig. 3 A). Time kinetics studies reveal a lag time of about 2.5 min in O2⨪production in cells stimulated by GD3. Subsequently, O2⨪production increased linearly with time and attained a peak level at about 10 min of incubation with GD3 (10 μm). Thereafter, O2⨪ production moderately decreased in these cells. The preincubation of cells with antioxidant PDTC completely abrogated GD3 induced O2⨪ generation (Fig. 3 C). However, superoxide dismutase partially inhibited GD3 induced O2⨪ levels (data not shown). These findings suggest that GD3-induced O2⨪levels were both endogenous and exogenous. Interestingly, as the concentration of GD3 in the incubation mixture increased, it was accompanied by a marked decrease in the level of GSH in these cells (Fig. 3 D). A 50% decrease in the GSH level occurred in cells incubated with 25 μm GD3, and this level was sustained up to 200 μm (Fig. 3 D). Cell membranes were prepared at varying time intervals after being incubated in A-SMC with/without GD3 (10 μm) and NADPH/NADH oxidase activity was measured. Following a lag time of about 2.5 min, NADPH/NADH oxidase activity increased linearly up to 10 min in cells incubated with GD3 (Fig. 4, A and B). The maximum increase in NADPH oxidase activity (4-fold compared with control) was observed after 10–15-min incubation of cells with GD3 (Fig. 4 A) and reached a plateau. Thereafter, there was no NADPH oxidase activity observed in the cytosolic fraction in cells incubated with and without GD3 (data not shown). GD3 maximally increased (1.8-fold) the activity of NADH oxidase in H-ASMC as compared with the control (Fig. 4 B) following incubation for 10 min. These time kinetics data were obtained using 10 μm GD3. However, at a relatively higher concentration (100 μm), GD3 decreased the activity of NADPH oxidase to approximately one-half-the control value (data not shown). And this may in part explain a decrease in O2⨪ production in A-SMC incubated with 100 μm GD3 (Fig. 3 A). Fig. 5 Arepresents the phosphorylation of the myelin basic protein peptide (APRTPGGRR) by immunoprecipitated cell lysate following stimulation with various concentrations of GD3. A concentration-dependent increase in MAPK activity was observed up to a concentration of about 10 μm GD3. However, we observed a progressive decline in the level of phosphorylated MBP in cells incubated with 50–200 μm of GD3 (Fig. 5 B). In fact, at a concentration of 100 μm GD3, MBP phosphorylation fell below the control value. As shown in Fig. 5 B, GD3 (10 μm) exerted a time-dependent stimulation in the activity of MAPK. Interestingly, preincubation of cells with cell-permeable antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and PDTC abrogated GD3 (10 μm) induced MAPK activity (Fig. 5 C). GD3 (10 μm) exerted about a 5-fold increase in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in A-SMC, an index of cell proliferation (Fig. 5 D). Preincubated cells with PDTC and NAC completely abrogated GD3 induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Following the incubation of A-SMC with 10 μmGD3 for 12 h, there was no production of NO (Fig. 6 A). However, at higher concentrations (50–200 μm) GD3 markedly stimulated NO production. A maximum of 5-fold stimulation in NO production was observed with 100–200 μm GD3 (relative to control); this was within the range of stimulation of NO by LPS (10 μg/ml) and interferon-γ (200 units/ml) for 24 h. GD3-induced NO production was completely inhibited by preincubation of cells with 200 μm N G-monomethyl-l-arginine (NMLA) (Fig. 6 B). The incubation of A-SMC with GD3 (0–10 μm) had no effects on apoptosis/DNA ladder formation (Fig. 6 C). However, at higher concentration (100–200 μm) GD3 markedly stimulated the intranucleosomal DNA degradation after 24 h, which was abrogated by preincubation of cells with NMLA (200 μm) (Fig. 6 C). At a concentration of 10 μm, GD3 did not induce the release of cytochrome c from the motochondria to cytosol. However, as we increased the concentration (50–200 μm) of GD3, a progressive increase in the level of cytochrome c release in cytosol was observed (Fig. 7). As a control we used C2-ceramide (1 μm), which also stimulated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in these cells. Although glycosphingolipids have been shown to be present in mammalian cells their functional role in cell proliferation, adhesion and programmed cell death (apoptosis) are only beginning to emerge (1.Hakomori S.I. Igarashi Y. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 147-162PubMed Google Scholar,2.Chatterjee S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 26.Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Hakomori S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18713-18716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GD3 is a disialoganglioside that is enriched in human aortic smooth muscle cells. However, in pathological conditions such as in human melanomas and in atherosclerotic plaques, the level of GD3 is markedly elevated (9.Mukhin D. Chao F.F. Kruth H.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27.Hakomori S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18713-18716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we explain signaling mechanisms by which GD3 can induce aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation as well as apoptosis. Previous studies employing subcellular fractionation, cell surface labeling, and electron microscope techniques have shown that gangliosides are predominately associated with the plasma membrane (27.Hakomori S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18713-18716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The employment of freeze-fracture techniques revealed that globotriosylceramide is localized as microaggregates on the surface of erythrocytes (28.Tillack T.W. Allietta M. Moren P.E. Young W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 793: 15-24Google Scholar). Employing [3H]GD3 in this study we have shown that during early time periods (10–30 min) of incubation, this ganglioside was associated mainly with a trypsin-sensitive cell surface component. Our studies confirm a previous report in human skin fibroblasts in which [3H]GM1 radioactivity was also found to associate with human skin fibroblast in a trypsin-sensitive state. However, upon long term (24 h or more) incubation [3H]GM1 radioactivity was found to reside in trypsin-resistant state in cell membranes. The validity of the trypsinization procedure employed was established by electron spin resonance studies (29.Schwarzmann G. Hoffman-Bleihauer P. Schubert J. Sandhoff K. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5041-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We have not identified the chemical nature of GD3 binding cell surface component, but speculate it to be a glycopeptide/glucan. This speculation is based on a previous observation that a novel carbohydrate-glycosphingolipid interaction occurs between a β-(1–3) glucan immunomodulator, PGG-glucan, and lactosylceramide in human leukocytes (30.Zimmerman J.W. Lindermuth J. Fish P.A. Palace G.P. Stevenson T.T. Demong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22014-22020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The relevance of the uptake of [3H]GD3 kinetics with free radicals and cell signaling became evident when we observed that within 5 to 10 min of incubation with GD3 a 2-and 3-fold increase in the generation of superoxide occurred (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that the association of exogenously supplied GD3 to A-SMC cell surface was critical for the production of superoxide. This was accompanied by the activation/phosphorylation of MAPK and other downstream events that collectively contributed to A-SMC proliferation. This phenotypic change could be abrogated by preincubation of cells with NADPH oxidase inhibitor; diphenylene iododium, scavenger of free radicals;N-acetylcysteine; and a membrane permeable antioxidant such as PDTC (15.Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It may also be possible that GD3 molecules inserted into the plasma membrane (and which may well be in the range of about 1 mol%) are responsible for the formation of ROS, in particular in view of its likely distribution in so called rafts, where its concentration would be even higher. On the other hand, a cross-linking of surface proteins by surface-adhering GD3 micelles may evoke these effects by mimicking transmemmbrane signaling. Why the exogenous supply of GD3 is required to bring about the generation of superoxide and cell proliferation when A-SMC have significant levels of endogenous GD3 is not clear to us at the present time. However, we have conducted preliminary studies employing wild type Chinese hamster ovary cells and mutant cells (SPB-1) that are devoid of LacCer and GD3 to address this issue. We observed that the basal level of superoxide generated (without exogenous supply of LacCer/GD3) in wild type and mutant cells was very low. However, upon the addition of exogenous LacCer/GD3 (10 μm) the mutant cells and wild type cells produced a 2–5-fold higher level of O2⨪ as compared with control. Thus our preliminary studies revealed that exogenously supplied LacCer/GD3 stimulates O2⨪generation and may contribute to phenotypic changes in mammalian cells. A detailed description of our studies on wild type and mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells will be published elsewhere. 2A. Bhunia, G. Sato, and S. Chatterjee, unpublished observations. Lipid second messenger such as LacCer and GD3 have been shown to be produced in cells upon the activation of glycosphingolipid glycosyltransferases by cytokines. For example, we showed that incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with TNF-α activated LacCer synthase and generated LacCer. In turn, LacCer activated NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide that was critical in the expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and the adhesion of neutrophils to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (31.Bhunia A.K. Arai T. Bulkley G. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34349-34357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This phenotypic change in cells treated with TNF-α was abrogated by preincubation withd-threo-l-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (d-PDMP), but was bypassed by LacCer presumably via the generation of O2⨪ by the latter compound. Our studies with d-PDMP and phenyl 2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholinopropanol (P-PMP) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and A-SMC have shown that these compounds do not abrogate O2⨪ generation in these cells. However, only d-PDMP abrogated TNF-α-induced O2⨪ generation and cell adhesion. P-PMP is a specific inhibitor of a glucosyltransferase, an enzyme recruited by mammalian cells to synthesize glucosylceramide, a precursor of LacCer. On the other hand, d-PDMP, in addition to inhibiting this glucosyltransferase activity, also inhibits the activity of LacCer synthase and other GSL glycosyltransferases. In a relevant study with rat hepatocytes TNF-α was shown to increase the synthesis of GD3 ∼2-fold within 2 h of incubation and rendered the cells apoptotic (32.Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Paris R. Fernandez-Checa J.C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Moreover, apoptosis was abrogated in rat hepatocytes by the use of P-PMP. Mechanistic studies pursued further employing rat hepatocyte mitochondria revealed that GD3 stimulated the generation of hydrogen peroxide within 15–30 min and enhanced the permeability of mitochondrial membrane to release cytochrome c (33.Garcia-Ruiz C.

We also found that incubation of A-SMC with large concentrations of GD3 stimulated the release of cytochrome c that in turn may have contributed to apoptosis (see below). Previously, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol has been implicated in the apoptotic process. Interestingly, a cell-permeable ceramide (C2-ceramide) also stimulated the release of cytochrome c in our studies but did not generate ROS or NO. This is most likely explained by the observation that ceramide may be converted to GD3, which in turn produces NO to induce apoptosis (11.Fukumoto S. Mutoh T. Hasegawa T. Miyazaki H. Okada M. Goto G. Furukawa K. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5832-5837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Collectively, these lines of evidence provide strong support for the hypothesis that GD3 recruits NO to induce apoptosis in cultured H-ASMC. Reduced GSH is a tripeptide antioxidant, which is present in all mammalian cells at a concentration between 1 and 10 mm(34.Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3277) Google Scholar). The predominant role of GSH is to provide a reduced environment inside the cell and to protect cells from redox stress. Our studies indicate that at higher concentration, GD3 exerts a concentration-dependent decrease in the level of GSH. This may also contribute to the process of apoptosis. Because apoptosis can be induced in a number of cell systems by hydrogen peroxide, we measured the effects of GD3 on hydrogen peroxide levels. We found that although at low concentrations (10 μm), GD3 stimulated hydrogen peroxide levels, at high concentrations (100–200 μm) it reduced the cellular level of hydrogen peroxides (data not shown). Thus, these studies suggested that GD3 might not employ hydrogen peroxide or superoxide to induce death. On the other hand, previous studies have shown that exposure of cells to a variety of agonists such as pyrogallol, a generator of ROS, increases the DNA binding activity of NFkB that is followed by an increase in an inducible nitric-oxide synthase mRNA (35.Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of nitric oxide, in turn, stimulated apoptosis. This tenet was substantiated further by determining the effects of GD3 on the levels of nitric oxide by directly measuring the levels of nitrate as well as inducible nitric-oxide synthase levels by Western immunoblot assays. Although GD3 did not induce inducible nitric-oxide synthase in A-SMC and nitrite production at low concentrations, at high concentrations, GD3 stimulated nitric oxide production. Previous studies have indicated that nitric oxide serves as a scavenger of O2⨪ and forms toxic peroxynitrite (ONOO−) radicals with endogeneous O2⨪, which induces apoptosis. Accordingly, we can speculate that at high concentrations, GD3 generates NO that reacts with the endogenous O2⨪. That markedly decreases the cellular level of O2⨪to produce toxic ONOO−. In turn, ONOO−induces apoptosis. This mechanism may also explain why the level of O2⨪ decreases as a function of GD3 concentration (Fig. 3 A) in addition to a decrease in NADPH oxidase activity. In summary, nonstimulated SMCs produce very low levels of O2⨪for the maintenance of normal growth and function but do not produce any NO. However, during the progressive phase in atherosclerosis, GD3 may stimulate cell proliferation via induction of O2⨪generation. In advanced atherosclerosis, when large amounts of GD3 have been found to be associated with plaque intima, it may lead to the generation of nitric oxide and subsequently peroxynitrite. Clearly, additional studies in vivo need to be pursued to assess the physiological relevance of GD3-mediated phenotypic changes in vitro in human aortic smooth muscle cells."

Although recent structural, biochemical, and mechanical measurements are beginning to converge into a common view of how kinesin converts the energy from ATP turnover into motion, it remains difficult to dissect experimentally the intermolecular domain cooperativity required for kinesin processivity. We report here our pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of a kinesin switch I mutant at Arg210 (NXXSSRSH, residues 205–212 in Drosophila kinesin). The results show that the R210A substitution results in a dimeric kinesin that is defective for ATP hydrolysis and a motor that cannot detach from the microtubule although ATP binding and microtubule association occur. We propose a mechanistic model in which ATP binding at head 1 leads to the plus-end-directed motion of the neck linker to position head 2 forward at the next microtubule binding site. However, ATP hydrolysis is required at head 1 to lock head 2 onto the microtubule in a tight binding state before head 1 dissociation from the microtubule. This mechanism optimizes forward movement and processivity by ensuring that one motor domain is tightly bound to the microtubule before the second can detach.

Kinesin is a highly processive, dimeric mechanoenzyme that travels along microtubules toward their plus-ends in discrete 8-nm steps, each step tightly coupled to a single ATP turnover (1.Howard J.

This model is based on a disorder-to-order transition in the neck linker region for monomeric kinesin constructs.

This ordered state was reversed by the addition of ADP or loss of nucleotide. In addition, the cryo-electron microscopy of this proposed ATP state revealed a single discrete orientation of the neck linker with the carboxyl terminus of the motor domain directed toward the plus-end of the microtubule (4.Rice S.

These three conformations revealed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer were consistent with the results reported by Rice et al. (4.Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O.

Furthermore, biochemical studies of dimeric kinesin have demonstrated that ATP binding (or nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP) to one of the two kinesin heads will trigger ADP release from the other (6.Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 7.Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These pre-steady-state kinetics were the basis of the alternating site ATP hydrolysis model for kinesin motility. Another important contribution to our understanding of kinesin stepping was advanced by a molecular force clamp study that revealed a load-dependent isomerization that followed ATP binding (9.Schnitzer M.J. Visscher K. Block S.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). These results eliminated models in which ATP hydrolysis triggered the major conformational change for the 8-nm step and most loose coupling models, which predict that the ATP coupling ratio will decline with load. Therefore, the results from a variety of experimental approaches are converging into a model for kinesin plus-end directed motility and processivity. However, these studies have provided information predominantly for ATP-induced structural transitions. The results presented here focus on the role of ATP hydrolysis for motor domain coordination and tight coupling of ATP turnover with kinesin stepping. We present the kinetics of a dimeric kinesin motor construct in which the target amino acid, switch I Arg210, has been mutated to an alanine. The mutant kinesin motor, R210A, can be expressed and purified; therefore, we can evaluate the importance of Arg210 for ATP-dependent interactions that are required for ATP turnover and coordination of the motor domains. The results presented here show that the steady-state ATPase kinetics are dramatically reduced, yet ATP binding is comparable with wild type. R210A is defective for ATP hydrolysis, and the dissociation kinetics suggest that this mutant cannot detach from the microtubule, a step essential for microtubule-based movement. We propose a model in which ATP hydrolysis at the rearward head is required for the leading head to bind tightly to the microtubule, and this tight binding state of the forward head is required for rearward head dissociation. This strategy ensures forward motion of kinesin stepping and tight coupling of ATP turnover to movement. Radiolabeled ATP ([α-32P]ATP, >3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Paclitaxel (taxol, Taxus brevifolia) from Sigma, polyethyleneimine-cellulose F TLC plates (20 × 20 cm, plastic-backed; EM Science of Merck) from VWR Scientific (West Chester, PA). ATP, GTP, DEAE-Sephacel, and S-Sepharose from Amersham Biosciences. MantATP and mantADP were synthesized and characterized as described previously (8.Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10.Foster K.A. Gilbert S.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11.Woodward S.K.A. Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The steady and pre-steady-state kinetic experiments were performed in ATPase buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.2, with KOH, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mmpotassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 22–25 °C. All concentrations reported are final concentrations after mixing. The R210A kinesin mutant plasmid was constructed by introducing a single amino acid change in the K401-wt plasmid (12.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using the Chameleon Mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The arginine to alanine substitution at residue 210 was verified by DNA sequencing. The K401-wt motor contains the first 401 amino acids of the kinesin protein and when expressed is dimeric (13.Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The R210A plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS for expression in Escherichia coli and purification as described previously (14.Brendza K.M. Rose D.J. Gilbert S.P. Saxton W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31506-31514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The R210A protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using Bio-Rad Protein Assay with IgG as a protein standard. It was also measured spectrophotometrically at A 280 (12.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) based on the calculated extinction coefficient of 29,240m−1 cm−1 (26,740 protein + 2,500 ADP) and M r = 44,994 for R210A. Microtubules were polymerized from tubulin and stabilized with 20 μm taxol as previously described (12.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Sedimentation assays followed by SDS-PAGE confirmed that the microtubules were stable as the microtubule polymer. The concentrations of tubulin reported reflect the tubulin assembled into microtubules and stabilized with 20 μm taxol. The active site experiments were based on the binding of [α-32P]ATP (15.Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). R210A (K·ADP) at 5 μm was reacted with trace amounts of [α-32P]ATP, and the reaction was quenched with 5m formic acid at various times ranging from 5 s to 100 min. The products [α-32P]ADP + Pi are separated from [α-32P]ATP by TLC and quantified. Because ADP product release is so slow, each active site under the conditions of the assay retains [α-32P]ADP. The data were fit to a single exponential function, [ADP]=A*exp(−kofft)+CEquation 1 where A is the amplitude and t is time. The rate constant, k off, represents the rate of ADP release from the active site in the absence of microtubules, and the constant term C provides the active site concentration. Steady-state ATPase measurements were determined by following the hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP to form [α-32P]ADP·Pi as previously described (12.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These experiments were conducted as described previously (16.Foster K.A. Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35307-35318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). R210A at 2 μm was incubated with 0–20 μm microtubules in the absence of added nucleotides for 30 min, followed by centrifugation. The microtubule pellet was resuspended in ATPase buffer to equal the volume of the supernatant. Gel samples of the supernatant and resuspended pellet were prepared in 5× Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide, 2 m urea). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, analyzed by a Microtek Scan Maker X6EL scanner (Microtek, Redondo Beach, CA), and quantified using NIH Image version 1.62 to determine the fraction of R210A in the supernatant and pellet at each microtubule concentration. In Fig. 3 fractional binding, defined as the ratio of R210A in the pellet to total R210A, is plotted as a function of microtubule concentration. The data were fit to quadratic Equation 2, [Mt·K]/[K]=0.5{([K]+[Mt0]+Kd)−[([K]+[Mt0]+Kd) 2Equation 2 −4([K][Mt0])] 1/2}where [Mt·K]/[K] is the fraction of R210A sedimenting with microtubules, [K] is total R210A, [Mt0] is the total tubulin concentration, and K d is the dissociation constant. These experiments were performed to determine the pre-steady-state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis for the switch I mutant in comparison with K401-wt (17.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The preformed Mt·R210A complex (syringe concentrations: 16 μm R210A, 30 μm microtubules, 40 μm taxol) was rapidly mixed in a chemical quench-flow instrument (Kintek Corp., Austin, TX) with [α-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated with 5 m formic acid (syringe concentration) and expelled from the instrument. Radiolabeled ADP + Pi were separated from radiolabeled ATP by TLC, and the data were quantified. The concentration of [α-32P]ADP was determined for each reaction and plotted as a function of time (KaleidaGraph; Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The data were then fit to the burst equation, Product=A*[1−exp(−kbt)]+ksstEquation 3 where A is the amplitude of the pre-steady-state burst phase which represents the formation of [α-32P]ADP·Pi at the active site during the first turnover; k b is the rate constant of the exponential burst phase; t is time in seconds; andk ss is the rate constant of the linear phase (μm ADP·s−1). The rate constantk ss, when divided by enzyme concentration, corresponds to the rate of steady-state turnover at the same ATP and microtubule concentrations. Concentrations reported in the figure legends are final concentrations after mixing. The pre-steady-state kinetics of mantATP binding, mantADP release, R210A binding to microtubules, and detachment of R210A were all conducted using the SF-2001 Kintek stopped-flow instrument in ATPase buffer at 25 °C. For the mantATP and mantADP experiments, excitation was set at 360 nm (Hg arc lamp) with emitted light measured through a 400-nm cut-off filter (mant λem = 450 nm). The mantATP binding data in Fig. 5 A (inset) were fit to the following equation, kobs=k1[mantATP]+koffEquation 4 where k obs is the rate of first exponential increase in fluorescence, k 1 is the second-order rate constant for mantATP binding, andk off obtained from the y intercept is the rate of mantATP dissociation from the Mt·R210A·ATP complex. The microtubule association kinetics (Fig. 4) and the R210A dissociation kinetics (Fig. 7) were monitored by the change in turbidity at 340 nm. The exponential rate constants for microtubule association were plotted as a function of microtubule concentration and fit to Equation 5,kobs=k5[tubulin]+k−5Equation 5 where k obs is the rate of exponential process, k 5 is the second-order rate constant for microtubule association, and k −5 obtained from the y intercept is the rate constant for motor dissociation from the Mt·R210A complex.Figure 7ATP-promoted dissociation kinetics of Mt·R210A in comparison with Mt· K401-wt. A, the Mt·R210A complex (6 μm R210A, 6 μmtubulin) or the Mt·K401 complex (4 μm K401, 3.75 μm tubulin) was rapidly mixed with 1 mm MgATP plus 100 mm KCl. The Mt·K401 wild type data were fit to a double exponential function that provided the observed rate of dissociation at 16.3 ± 0.7 s−1. The R210A transient did not show a significant change in turbidity. B, the Mt·R210A complex (6 μm R210A, 6 μmtubulin) or the Mt·K401 complex (4 μm K401, 3.75 μm tubulin) was rapidly mixed with 1 mm MgATP but in the absence of the additional 100 mm KCl. The dissociation kinetics of K401-wt at 1.14 s−1 indicate that the wild type motor was in association with the microtubule for 0.88 s (transit time = 1/k obs). In contrast, R210A showed only a small turbidity change during the 30-s period of observation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We began the analysis of R210A by evaluating the mutant motor in the absence of microtubules to determine whether the mutant retained the fundamental enzymatic features of a kinesin: the ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP and to retain ADP tightly bound at the active site (Fig. 1). R210A was incubated with a trace amount of [α-32P]ATP. During the incubation, ADP tightly bound at the active site should be released, followed by the binding and hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP to yield a stable R210A·[α-32P]ADP intermediate. The results presented in Fig. 1 show that R210A exhibits the ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP. The rate constant of [α-32P]ADP release from the active site was 0.05 s−1, and this rate is somewhat faster than data reported previously for conventional kinesin at 0.006–0.01 s−1 (12.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18.Hackney D.D. Malik A.-S. Wright K.W. J. Biol.

Cross R.A. McKillop D.F.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This assay permitted the determination of R210A active site concentration at 4.6 μm. Therefore, these results document the ability of mutant R210A to bind and hydrolyze ATP followed by slow ADP release. Thus, in the absence of microtubules, R210A exhibits the characteristics expected of wild-type kinesin. The steady-state kinetics of R210A were determined in comparison with the kinetics of K401-wt (Fig. 2). The steady-state ATPase kinetics for the Mt·R210A complex were significantly altered in comparison with K401-wt as follows: R210A (seven preparations),k cat = 0.12 ± 0.05 s−1(0.07–0.15 s−1), K m(ATP) = 118 ± 62.7 μm (75–211 μm)versus K401-wt, k cat = 20–25 s−1, K m(ATP) = 60–96 μm. There are several hypotheses that can account for the extremely lowk cat of R210A. The first is that there is a defect in ATP turnover. The second hypothesis is that there is a problem with microtubule binding that will affect release of ADP from the active site of the mutant. The third hypothesis is that the protein was inactive and the small amount of ATP hydrolysis seen was due to a few active motors still functioning. However, the third hypothesis appears unlikely based on the results of the active site assay (Fig. 1), which confirmed that R210A was active and exhibited the characteristics of wild type kinesin in the absence of microtubules. The experiments presented below evaluate ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis, microtubule association and detachment, and microtubule-activated product release. One possible explanation for the depressed ATPase activity may be that microtubule binding and therefore Mt·R210A complex formation is aberrant. We evaluated formation of Mt·R210A complex by equilibrium binding (Fig. 3) and the pre-steady-state kinetics of Mt·R210A association (Fig. 4). The relative affinity of R210A for microtubules was determined by equilibrium binding in which R210A was incubated with increasing concentrations of microtubules, followed by centrifugation and analysis by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3 shows that R210A partitioned with microtubules as a function of tubulin concentration, and the fit of the data provided an apparent K d(Mt) = 0.95 μmtubulin with maximal fractional binding at 92%. The fact that the fractional binding is almost 100% suggests that the mutant motor can bind microtubules. However, the K d at 0.95 μm for R210A is weaker than the K ddetermined for the Mt·K401-wt complex at 37 nm (21.Moyer M.L. Mechanism of the Microtubule Kinesin Motor ATPasePh.D. thesis. Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA1998Google Scholar). R210A was rapidly mixed with microtubules in the stopped-flow instrument, and the turbidity signal was monitored to quantify Mt·R210A complex formation. The results presented in Fig. 4 show that the rate of microtubule association increased linearly as a function of microtubule concentration with the second-order rate constant,k +5 = 0.8 μm−1s−1 and k −5 = 5.8 s−1(Scheme 1, Table I). The kinetics for K401-wt have been reported at 10–20 μm−1s−1 with no evidence of an off rate (Table I) (22.Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A.

Open table in a new tab The kinetics of ATP binding were evaluated by rapidly mixing in the stopped-flow instrument the Mt·motor complex (15 μm tubulin plus 2 μm R210A or K401-wt) with increasing concentrations of the fluorescent ATP analog, mantATP (Fig. 5). The kinetics reveal a biphasic fluorescence enhancement. Because there is an increase in fluorescence as mantATP enters the more hydrophobic environment of the active site, we assume the initial rapid phase of fluorescence enhancement is mantATP binding to the active site. At low mantATP concentrations (<50 μm), the observed rate of the first exponential phase increased linearly as a function of mantATP concentration and provided the second-order rate constant, k +1 = 0.82 μm−1 s−1 with a dissociation rate of 26.9 s−1 (Scheme 1, Table I). For the Mt·K401-wt complex, mantATP binding was reported at 1.1 μm−1 s−1 with a dissociation rate of 9.8 s−1 (23.Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). ATP binding for wild type kinesin is believed to involve two steps (Scheme 2) based on our pulse-chase rapid quench kinetics with K401-wt (17.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the mantATP binding kinetics reported by Ma and Taylor for human kinesin K379 (25.Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the first step, the collision complex is formed (Mt·K·ATP), followed by a rate-limiting conformational change at 200 s−1 to form the Mt·K*·ATP intermediate that proceeds toward ATP hydrolysis. The kinetics for R210A indicate that the required conformational change does occur; however, the rate constant observed is 81 s−1. These data suggest that the ATP-driven structural transition required for ATP hydrolysis is slowed significantly in the mutant. Although the mantATP binding results indicate that the mutant was able to bind ATP effectively, the chemistry step of ATP hydrolysis was clearly aberrant. For the ATP hydrolysis kinetics (Fig. 6), a preformed Mt·R210A complex was rapidly mixed with [α-32P]ATP in the rapid quench instrument, followed by an acid quench to terminate the reaction and release nucleotide at the active site. The kinetics for K401-wt showed the expected, dramatic exponential burst of ADP·Piproduct formation at the active site during the first turnover because ATP binding and hydrolysis are fast steps for kinesin relative to the rate-limiting step in the pathway (17.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25.Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).

At higher expression levels, C-terminal LAP2α fragment and full-length protein led to cell cycle arrest in interphase and apoptosis, as shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, time lapse microscopy, and BrdUrd incorporation assays.

Furthermore, lamins and lamin-binding proteins are implicated in the structural organization of chromatin by binding to DNA and to chromosomal proteins (3Gotzmann J. Foisner R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nuclear structure is completely disassembled in higher eukaryotes during cell division, and lamins and lamin-binding proteins dissociate from chromosomes during metaphase and assemble around decondensing chromosomes during the formation of daughter nuclei in late anaphase/telophase (11Moir R.D.

Therefore, the association of lamins and lamin-binding proteins with chromosomes has been implicated in targeting nuclear envelope components to newly forming nuclei and in the structural organization of chromatin following mitosis. Studies by several groups have revealed various domains in LAP2 isoforms, which exhibit different chromosome binding properties (see Fig. 1). All LAP2 proteins share a highly conserved LEM domain (amino acid 111–152) (33Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L. McBurney M.W. Paulin-Levasseur M. Worman H.J. J. Biol.

The LEM domain has been identified as a core binding region for the DNA cross-bridging protein, barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) by yeast two hybrid and biochemical analysis (34Furukawa K. J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4399-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Moreover, the N-terminal 85 residues of the LAP2 constant region, which contains a LEM-like motif that was shown by structural analysis to bind DNA (38Cai M. Huang Y. Ghirlando R. Wilson K.L. Craigie R. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4399-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), was found to associate with chromosomes in vitro(18Furukawa K. Fritze C.E. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4213-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition to the common chromosome binding domains in the LAP2 constant region, a DNA binding region was described in the LAP2β-specific region (39Furukawa K. Glass C. Kondo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and we have recently identified a domain in the unique C terminus of LAP2α that is essential and sufficient for chromosome association of LAP2α during nuclear reassembly (40Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have also shown that LAP2α associates with chromosomes very early during nuclear reassembly after sister chromatid separation, clearly before LAP2β-containing membranes and the bulk of lamins assemble around chromosomes (40Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the early association of LAP2α with chromosomes did not require the N-terminal BAF and DNA interaction domains but was mediated by an ∼350-amino acid-long region in the LAP2α unique C terminus (Fig. 1). Using LAP2α fragments containing either the N-terminal common or the C-terminal unique chromatin interaction domains in in vitro nuclear assembly assays, we show here that both regions are essential for nuclear assembly in a timely coordinated fashion, the C-terminal domain being important for initial association with chromosomes and the N-terminal LEM and LEM-like domains for further steps of nuclear reorganization. As a consequence, C-terminal LAP2α fragments, which are able to bind chromosomes but lack these LEM domains, inhibited assembly of membranes and lamins around chromosomes. Furthermore, we show that, unlike the N-terminal domain, the C-terminal LAP2α fragment was able to bind to chromosomes in vivo when expressed weakly but caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in interphase at higher expression levels without progression to mitosis. These data indicate an important additional function of LAP2α in cell cycle progression during interphase that is clearly distinct from its role in nuclear assembly. For generation of GFP-LAP2α expression constructs, plasmid pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was modified as follows. The NheI restriction site was deleted through insertion of an oligonucleotide (5′-CTAGGGCC-3′) into the NheI site; the internal XhoI site was deleted; and NheI, EcoRI, and XhoI restriction sites were introduced into the multiple cloning site by insertion of oligonucleotides (5′-TCGAATGGCTAGCGAATTCCTCGAGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCTCGAGGAATTCGCTAGCCAT-3′) via XhoI and BamHI, creating pTD24. cDNAs encoding LAP2α-(1–693), LAP2α-(188–693), and LAP2α-(270–615), respectively, were subcloned from pTD15, pSV2, and pSV14 (40Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) into pTD24 via NheI-XhoI creating pTD45, pTD36, and pTD44, respectively. To generate pTD49 encoding GFP-LAP2-(1–187), an ApaI-XhoI fragment was subcloned from pTD10 into pTD15 (40Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) creating pTD47, and subsequently a NheI-XhoI fragment encoding LAP2-(1–187) was introduced into pTD24 creating pTD49. All GFP expression plasmids were kindly provided by T. Dechat, University of Vienna. For construction of IRES-EGFP expression vectors pI-Egfp2, a derivative of pKW2T (41Czerny T. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) containing an IRES-EGFP cassette (kindly provided by A. Souabni and M. Busslinger) was modified as follows. A start codon and a NheI restriction site were introduced into the multiple cloning site by insertion of oligonucleotides (5′-GATGGCTAGCG-3′, 5′-GATCCGCTAGCCATCTGCA-3′) via PstI-BamHI creating pSV37. A fragment containing the XhoI restriction site and a myc tag was then subcloned from pTD6 (40Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) into pSV37 via NheI-BamHI creating pSV38. cDNAs encoding LAP2α-(1–693), LAP2α-(188–693), LAP2α-(270–615), and LAP2-(1–187), respectively, were subcloned from pTD15, pSV2, pSV14, and pTD47 into pSV38 via NheI-XhoI creating pSV39, pSV41, pSV49, and pSV47. Normal rat kidney (NRK), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), and HeLa cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 8.5% CO2. To obtain metaphase-arrested cells, subconfluent NRK cell cultures were incubated for 10–12 h in medium containing 2 mm thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich), released from the block in medium without thymidine for 4 h, and further incubated for 12–14 h in medium containing 0.2 μg/ml nocodazole (Calbiochem). All transfections were performed according to the procedures of the manufacturer, using LipofectAMINE reagent, Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and DNA prepared with EndoFree plasmid kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). HeLa cells were seeded on 6-cm culture dishes (Nunc Inc., Roskilde, Denmark), grown overnight to 70% confluence, and transfected with 7.1 μg of DNA. For immunofluorescence microscopy and FACS analyses, cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight after transfection, trypsinized, reseeded, and cultivated for 1–4 days. Cells were trypsinized, suspended in ice-cold PBS, 1% fetal calf serum, and analyzed by FACS (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For time lapse microscopy, cells were seeded on glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA), grown for 8–48 h after transfection, and incubated in phenol red-free complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria) containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst dye 33258 (Calbiochem) at 37 °C. Cells were viewed with an Axiovert S100TV (Zeiss) and a CCD camera (Princeton Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ). Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) using the inducible T7 RNA polymerase-dependent pET vector system (40Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h, and bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min (Heraeus Megafuge, 1.0R). Bacteria were frozen in one-tenth of the original culture volume of Tris buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3.3 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (all from Sigma-Aldrich), thawed, lysed by adding 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml DNase, and 20 μg/ml RNase, left at 30 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in one-tenth of the original culture volume of Tris buffer, 7m urea was added, and the samples were incubated for 40 min at room temperature and homogenized in a glass-glass homogenizer. Cell lysates were subsequently spun at 45,000 rpm (TY65 rotor, Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA) for 30 min, and supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. If fragments were soluble in Tris buffer, DNase and RNase digestion was left out, and urea was added directly to the cell extract prior to centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Renaturation of recombinant proteins was achieved by dialyzing twice against KHM buffer (see below) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Other protease inhibitors were added then, samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min, and supernatants were used for in vitro nuclear reassembly reactions. Metaphase chromosomes were isolated from nocodazole-arrested CHO cells as described previously (17Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 40Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For in vitro nuclear assembly assays, nocodazole-arrested NRK cells were incubated in complete medium containing 20 μm cytochalasin B (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2 μg/ml nocodazole for 30 min at 37 °C and were lysed in ∼5 volumes of ice-cold KHM buffer (78 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 8.4 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors and 20 μm cytochalasin B using a metal ball cell cracker (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany; 15 strokes with ball, r = 8.008 or 8.006 mm). Cell lysates were either used directly for nuclear assembly or centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min to remove chromosomes. For assembly, 200 μl of chromosome-free cell lysates were mixed with 100 μl of exogenous metaphase chromosome fraction (A260 = 3), and the mixture or total cell lysates containing endogenous chromosomes were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C without or after the addition of dialyzed recombinant protein. Phosphatase inhibitors (0.1 μm calyculin A, 0.1 μm okadaic acid (Invitrogen), 1 mmorthovanadate, and 0.5 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich)) were added then, and samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. For immunofluorescence microscopy, 3.7% formaldehyde was added to in vitro nuclear assembly extracts, and lysates were gently spun onto coverslips (500 rpm for 20 s) and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. HeLa cells were fixed on Petri dishes in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS. Samples were incubated in 50 mmNH4Cl/PBS and in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min each. For BrdUrd labeling, cells were pulsed with 10 μmol/liter BrdUrd (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h and fixed with 70% ethanol, 50 mm glycine, pH 2. All samples were incubated in 0.2% gelatin/PBS for 30 min and with primary and secondary antibodies in PBS/gelatin for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies used were antiserum to LAP2α (1:1000) generated against the recombinant LAP2α C terminus (amino acids 188–693) or undiluted hybridoma supernatants containing antibodies to LAP2α or LAP2β (21Dechat T. Gotzmann J. Stockinger A. Harris C.A. Talle M.A. Siekierka J.J. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4887-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), a monoclonal antibody to lamins A/C (diluted 1:50 (42Loewinger L. McKeon F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2301-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488-coupled goat anti-mouse (1:50, Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Membranes were stained with 20 μg/ml DHCC (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at room temperature, and DNA was stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst dye 33258 for 10 min. Samples were mounted in Mowiol and viewed in a Zeiss Axiovert 100 m microscope equipped with a Zeiss LSM confocal laser scanning microscope. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were done as described previously (21Dechat T. Gotzmann J. Stockinger A. Harris C.A. Talle M.A. Siekierka J.J. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4887-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were anti-LAP2 antibodies (hybridoma supernatants against LAP2α and LAP2β, undiluted) and monoclonal anti-lamin A/C antibody (1:1000). For immunological detection of the proteins, the Protoblot Immunoscreening System (Promega, Madison, WI) or the SuperSignal ECL system (Pierce) were used. Quantification of stained protein bands was done using NIH Image software. TUNEL assays were done using the apoptosis detection system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In addition to the LEM- and LEM-like domains in the N-terminal constant region of LAP2, which mediate the binding to chromosomal protein BAF and to DNA, respectively (34Furukawa K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Shumaker D.K. Lee K.K. Tanhehco Y.C. Craigie R. Wilson K.L.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4399-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we have recently identified a region in the LAP2α unique C-terminal part (amino acids 270–615, Fig. 1) that is essential and sufficient for binding of LAP2α to mitotic chromosomes in vitro (40Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because we found that LAP2α associates with chromosomes at early stages of nuclear assembly prior to the accumulation of lamins and LAP2β (20Dechat T. Korbei B. Vaughan O.A. Vlcek S. Hutchison C.J. Foisner R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3473-3484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dechat T. Gotzmann J. Stockinger A. Harris C.A. Talle M.A. Siekierka J.J. Foisner R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the protein might have important functions in nuclear reassembly. To investigate these functions in more detail and to identify the specific contributions of N- and C-terminal chromosome-binding domains to this process, we performed in vitro nuclear assembly studies in the presence or absence of bacterially expressed LAP2α fragments. Incubation of nocodazole-arrested mitotic NRK cell lysates containing endogenous chromosomes or of chromosome-depleted mitotic cell fractions with exogenous metaphase chromosomes at 37 °C caused the majority of LAP2α to shift from a soluble chromosome-free fraction to a sedimentable chromosome-containing fraction (Fig. 2A, Control panel) (21Dechat T. Gotzmann J. Stockinger A. Harris C.A. Talle M.A. Siekierka J.J. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4887-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), reflecting partial in vitro assembly of nuclear structures such as the nuclear membrane and nuclear lamina (43Burke B. Gerace L. Cell. 1986; 44: 639-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For a more quantitative statistical analysis of protein assembly, we calculated the efficiencies of assembly (ΔP) defined by the relative amount of cellular LAP2α, LAP2β, and lamins A/C in the pellet fractions at 60 min of incubation minus the relative amounts in the pellet fractions at 0 min (Fig. 2B). Immunofluorescence microscopy of samples using antibodies to the proteins and a lipid dye to detect membranes showed that condensed chromosomes at the 0 min time point did not contain any LAP2α, LAP2β, lamins A/C, or membranes. However, after a 60-min incubation the chromosomes had visibly started to decondense, and LAP2α and lamins A/C were detected at the chromosomes, with LAP2β and the membrane detected mostly at the rim of the DNA structures (Fig. 3A). This reflects the distribution of the proteins in postmitotic stages in vivo(17Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 21Dechat T.

The phosphorylated protein was purified and identified as moesin, a member of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family and a general cross-linker between cortical actin filaments and plasma membranes. The purified moesin from rat brain was phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues. Moesin was rapidly phosphorylated at the threonine 558 residue after ECS in the rat hippocampus, peaked at 1 min, and returned to the basal level by 2 min after ECS. To investigate the mechanism of moesin phosphorylation in neuronal cells, we stimulated a rat hippocampal progenitor cell, H19–7/IGF-IR, with glutamate, and observed the increased phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558. Glutamate transiently activated RhoA, and constitutively active RhoA increased the basal level phosphorylation of moesin. The inhibition of RhoA and its effector, Rho kinase, abolished increased Thr-558 phosphorylation by glutamate in H19–7/IGF-IR cells, suggesting that the phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558 in H19–7/IGF-IR cells by glutamate is mediated by RhoA and Rho kinase activation.

Although the mechanism of the treatment has not been elucidated, recent progress in the cellular and molecular biology of neuronal tissues has enabled neuronal functions to be linked to the regulation of gene expression and intracellular signal transduction (1.Fochtmann L.J. Psychopharmacol. Bull. 1994; 30: 321-444PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we reported (4.Lee Y.H. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Park J.B. Ahn Y.M. Kim Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) that ECS induces the expressions of various immediate early genes such as c-fos, junB, and TiS-8 and that it suppresses the expression of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate kinase and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor genes. We also observed (2.Kang U.G. Jeon S.H. Lee J.E. Joo Y.-H. Yi J.S. Park J.-B. Juhn Y.-S. Kim Y.S. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 3.Kang U.G. Hong K.S.

Several protein kinases have been suggested to be CREB kinases in neuronal tissues, and we looked for protein kinases potentially responsible for CREB phosphorylation. When we were studying the phosphorylation of one of the suggested CREB kinases, ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), we observed that a 75-kDa protein in the rat hippocampus was rapidly phosphorylated after ECS. This was detected by an antibody specific to phospho-p70 S6K. The protein was not detected by the anti-p70 S6K antibody, suggesting that this protein was detected nonspecifically by an anti-phospho-p70-S6K antibody. So we purified and identified this protein as moesin (membrane-organizing extension spike protein), a member of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family of proteins. ERM proteins consist of three domains: 1) a globular domain at the N-terminal half, which is conserved among the members of the band 4.1 superfamily and is referred to as the FERM (4.1 and ERM) domain, a membrane-binding domain; followed by 2) an extended α-helical domain; and 3) a charged C-terminal domain, which includes a consensus sequence motif for actin binding. Thus, ERM proteins have been suggested to function as cross-linkers between actin filaments and plasma membranes and to be involved in the formation of microvilli, cell adhesion sites, ruffling membranes, and cleavage furrows (8.Bretscher A.

In thrombin-activated platelets, moesin is phosphorylated at a specific C-terminal 558 threonine residue (Thr-558), causing filopodia formation (16.Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In vitro functional analysis suggested that C-terminal threonine phosphorylation maintains ERM proteins in the active state by suppressing intramolecular interaction (17.Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). RhoA is a member of the Ras-like GTPase superfamily and has been shown to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and mitogenic signaling in response to extracellular signals (18.Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, ERM proteins were phosphorylated and relocalized to apical membrane/actin protrusions in a RhoA-dependent manner (19.Shaw R.J. Hary M. Solomon F. Jacks T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and in Swiss 3T3 cells at least one of the ERM proteins was shown to be required for the RhoA-dependent formation of stress fibers and focal contacts (20.Mackay D.J. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). RhoA has been reported to activate several serine/threonine kinases such as ROK/ROCK-II/Rho kinase, ROK/ROCK-I, citron kinase, protein kinase N, and protein kinase C1 (20.Mackay D.J. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Rho kinase effectively phosphorylates moesin at Thr-558 in vivo, and this phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the formation of microvilli-like structures (21.Oshiro N. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34663-34666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). During development and regeneration, neurons grow over large distances in a process controlled by extrinsic factors and cytoskeletal interaction. The suppression of radixin and moesin altered growth cone morphology, motility, and process formation in primary cultured neurons (29.Paglini G. Kunda P. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Caceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, functional studies have established that in sympathetic neurons, growth cone collapse induced by nerve growth factor deprivation is concomitant with a significant decrease of the radixin staining of growth cones (22.Gonzalez-Agosti C. Solomon F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that localization of the ERM protein may be essential for the normal expression of growth cone morphology. However, the phosphorylation of ERM proteins in neuron tissues and cells has not been studied, and it is also unknown whether ERM proteins, including moesin, are involved in neuronal cell cytoskeletal changes. We identified moesin as a protein that showed increased phosphorylation after ECS in the rat brain and report that glutamate induces the phosphorylation of moesin through the activation of RhoA and Rho kinase in rat hippocampal neuronal cells. Male Sprague-Dawley rats ranging from 150 to 200 g were used in this study. Animals were treated in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. ECS was administered (130 V, 0.5 s) via an ear electrode. Control animals were treated in the same manner as the ECS-treated animals but without the electric current. The animals were decapitated at the prescribed times (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min after ECS), and hippocampi were removed onto ice and homogenized immediately with a glass Teflon homogenizer in 10 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, 4 °C. The protein samples were prepared by boiling the supernatant with 3× Laemmli's sampling buffer. Protein was quantitatively assayed using bicinchoninic acid (Sigma) or Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Thirty rat brains, dissected 1 min after ECS, were homogenized in buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) at a ratio of 5 ml/g of brain, wet weight. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 rpm in a Beckman rotor, and the resulted supernatant was loaded at the speed of 3 ml/min to 100 ml of packed DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A. The eluted and washed fractions were pooled and applied to a 40-ml SP-Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A at a speed of 2 ml/min. The column was washed with 250 ml of 50 mm NaCl/buffer A and then eluted with 100 ml of 500 mm NaCl/buffer A. Fractions of 4 ml were collected. The fractions containing enriched 75-kDa protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the pooled sample was applied to a 20-ml column of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–500 mm). The 75-kDa protein was eluted between 100 and 200 mm NaCl. The eluant was dialyzed against buffer A, filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane, and applied at 1 ml/min to a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A, and the 75-kDa protein was eluted as flow-through and washed out fractions. The eluant was concentrated with a Centricon 50 (Amicon) for glycerol gradients. Aliquots (200 μl) were loaded onto 5 ml of a glycerol gradient mixture (from 15 to 35% glycerol/buffer A and 500 mm NaCl) and centrifuged for 24 h at 47,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 55Ti rotor. Elution was carried out with a Beckman recovery system and 11 drops were collected per fraction. To obtain a single band of the 75-kDa protein, preparative gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad) was carried out at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, and 200 μl each were collected per fractions. The presence of 75-kDa protein was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-p70 S6 kinase antibody, and the protein amount was estimated by Bradford reagent and gel staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Samples containing 1 mg of the hippocampal lysates were precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) for 1 h. After preclearing, each lysate was incubated with 20 μl of anti-moesin monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h, and the resulting immune complexes were pelleted at 10,000 × g and washed three times in homogenization buffer. Sample buffer (3×) was added, and samples were incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. 80 mg of the hippocampal lysates and 20 μg of the cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were then electrophoresed in 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with anti-phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr-421/Ser-424) (New England Biolabs), anti-moesin polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphothreonine and anti-phosphoserine (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Myc (provided by Prof. M. Han of Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea) and anti-phospho-ERM (297S) antibodies (kindly provided by Dr. S. Tsukita of Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with Tris-buffered saline/Tween (0.05%), the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-rat, or anti-mouse IgGs, and the bands were visualized using the ECL system (Pierce). Molecular weights were determined by comparing the mobilities of the protein bands with prestained molecular weight markers (Invitrogen). One microgram of purified 75-kDa protein was electrophoresed in 8% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The two stained bands were separately excised from the gel and digested with trypsin. Sequence analysis was performed upon the trypsin-digested peptide by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. A plasmid (pSK moesin) encoding full-length mouse moesin protein was obtained from Dr. S. Tsukita (Kyoto University). To construct the GST fusion proteins, the moesin DNA sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α cells and purified on glutathione-agarose beads. A moesin polyclonal antibody was produced in rabbit against purified GST-fused full-length mouse moesin. The antibody reacted only with moesin, not with ezrin or radixin, and we have named the antibody TM2. A polyclonal antibody against Thr-558-phosphorylated ERM proteins was raised in rabbits against a KLH-conjugated synthesized phosphopeptide (KYKpTLRQCCCCC, where pT is phosphothreonine) (peptide from Genemed Synthesis; KLH from Pierce), which corresponded to the mouse moesin sequence from amino acids 555–561. The resulting antibody reacted with only phosphorylated ERM proteins but not unphosphorylated ERM proteins. H19–7/IGF-IR cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg/ml G418, and 1 μg/ml puromycin at 34 °C under 5% CO2. H19–7/IGF-IR cells were seeded at 2 × 105 in a 6-well plate coated with poly-l-lysine. For glutamate treatment, the cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 18 h and then stimulated with or without 100 μm glutamate for various periods (2, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min). The transfection of plasmids (3.2 μg of pcDNA C3, pCMV-Myc RhoAV14, or empty vectors) into H19–7/IGF-IR cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient overexpression of the pCMV-Myc RhoAV14 proteins was verified by immunoblotting cell lysates with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. The transient overexpression of C3 transferase was detected by the mobility shift of ADP-ribosylated endogenously expressed RhoA (26.Aktories K. Hall A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 415-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 20 h and then stimulated with or without 100 μm glutamate for 10 min. To examine the involvement of Rho kinase in glutamate-induced moesin phosphorylation, we used a Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 (Tocris Cookson). Before the glutamate treatments, 30 μm Y-27632 was incubated with serum-free DMEM for 1 h in H19–7/IGF-IR cells Rat1 and MDCK were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For lysophosphatidic acid (LPA, Avanti Polar Lipids) treatment, Rat1 cells were seeded at 4 × 105 cells in a 6-well plate. The next day, the cells were serum-starved for 18 h in serum-free DMEM. After adding LPA to a concentration of 1 μg/ml, the cells were incubated for various periods (0, 2, 5, 10, and 30 min). For phosphorylation analysis, H19–7/IGF-IR and Rat1 cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, and then solubilized with 100 μl of 1 × Laemmli's sample buffer. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 activities were measured according to the modified method of Renet al. (23.Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). The H19–7/IGF-IR cells (2 × 107 cells) were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and serum-starved in serum-free DMEM for 18 h before lysis. The cells were then treated with or without 100 μm glutamate. For a RhoA activity assay, the cells were lysed with ice-cold buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. The cell lysates were then passed 10 times through a 23-gauge needle and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with 30 μg of glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to the GST-RhoA-binding domain of mouse rhotekin for 60 min at 4 °C. For Rac1 or Cdc42 activity assays, the cells were resuspended in 200 μl of NS buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 10 min on ice and then passed 10 times through a 25gauge needle. After the addition of 200 μl of 2× no-salt lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), the cell lysate was passed through a 23G needle 10 times and placed on ice for 5 min, and then 400 μl of high salt-binding buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) were added, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with 30 μg of glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to the GST-Rac/Cdc42-binding domain of rat PAK3 (GST-PBD) for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm DTT). The bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli's sample buffer, separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA, anti-Rac1, and anti-Cdc42 antibodies. To obtain cytosolic and membranous fractions, Rat1 cells were rinsed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in detergent-free buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) by passing 10 times through a 25 gauge needle. The lysed cells were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants were used as cytosol, and the pellets as crude membrane. The samples were added with sample buffer (3×) and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. Previously we reported that ECS induces CREB phosphorylation in the rat hippocampus (6.Jeon S.H. Seong Y.S. Juhnn Y.S. Kang U.G. Ha K.S. Kim Y.S. Park J.B. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To identify the kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of CREB in the rat hippocampus after ECS, we studied the phosphorylation of Rsk, a cytosolic protein kinase for ribosomal S6, which was reported as a CREB kinase in glial cell progenitors (24.Pende M. Fisher T.L. Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. Blenis J. Gallo V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, we examined the mobility shifts of Rsks after ECS in the rat hippocampus and could observe the mobility shifts (data not shown). We then examined the phosphorylation status of S6K in the rat brain after ECS using an anti-phospho-p70 S6K antibody. S6K was highly phosphorylated in the rat hippocampus before stimulation, and we were unable to find any further S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 1, arrowhead). However, we found that this antibody cross-reacted with five more bands (Fig. 1), and three of these showed density changes after ECS (upper, middle, and lower arrows). The antibody against S6K itself did not detect any protein bands coincident with these three proteins, indicating that these proteins might not be directly related to S6K. Because the phospho-specific antibody was generated against the serine- and threonine-phosphorylated peptide of S6K, we presumed that the increase in band intensities suggested the increased phosphorylation of serine and/or threonine residues in these proteins. Of the three bands, we focused on the middle protein, which was a doublet of 75 and 80 kDa. The phosphorylation of the doublet was so rapid that it only lasted 1 min after ECS in the rat hippocampus (Fig. 1). To identify the protein, we purified it from the brain lysates of ECS-treated rats (1 min after ECS) using the six-step procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” During the purification steps, we lost the 80-kDa protein and, therefore, were only able to purify the 75-kDa protein to homogeneity (Fig. 2 A, left panel). Because we traced the 75-kDa protein during the purification procedures by immunoblotting, we were unable to estimate purification fold and yield. Coomassie staining of the final preparation revealed two protein bands, a major band with molecular size of 75 kDa and a minor smaller molecular size band. These two proteins both reacted with the anti-phospho-p70 S6K antibody, and their band intensities coincided with the protein amounts (Fig. 2 A, right panel), suggesting that the smaller protein might be a proteolytic product of the major protein. The major band was eluted from the gel and digested with trypsin. The masses of the tryptic peptides were measured by MALDI-TOF. The masses of 10 peptides were analyzed using a data base search program (NCBInr 02.15.00), and it was found that seven of these peptides matched those of rat moesin (data not shown). To confirm whether the purified 75-kDa protein was really a moesin, the purified protein was immunoblotted with a commercially available monoclonal antibody against human moesin (Figs. 2 and 4, α-ME). This antibody reacted with the lower band as well as the upper band, and the intensities corresponded well with the amount of purified protein (Fig. 2 B, left panel). Although we did not identify the lower band of purified proteins by peptide analysis, these results imply that the lower band may have been caused by a cleavage of moesin during the purification.Figure 4Production of moesin and Thr-558-phosphorylated moesin-specific antibodies. A, to examine the specificity of the moesin antibody, the total cell lysates of Rat1 cells (lane 1), MDCK cells (lane 2), and H19–7/IGF-IR cells (lane 3) were electrophoresed in parallel SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-moesin (α-TM2 or α-ME) antibodies; theupper arrow indicates ezrin and thelower arrow indicates moesin. B, to test the specificity of the phospho-ERM antibody (α-p-ThrERM) against the C-terminal threonine 558 of moesin, membrane and cytosolic fractions from serum-starved Rat1 cells were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p-ThrERM or TM2 antibodies. The anti-p-ThrERM antibody reacts with moesin in the membrane fraction, which is of the phosphorylated form.C, serum-starved Rat1 cells were unstimulated or stimulated with LPA, and after 0, 2, 5, 10, or 30 min of incubation whole cell lysates were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p-ThrERM or TM2 antibodies. C, unstimulated Rat1 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After the purified protein had been identified as moesin, we examined the phosphorylation of the purified moesin. Because the anti-phospho-p70 S6K antibody we used was produced against a synthetic peptide dually phosphorylated at the Thr-421 and Ser-424 residues of S6K, we examined the phosphorylation of the serine and threonine residues of the purified moesin with the anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. Both the anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies reacted with the purified moesin, indicating that the purified moesin was phosphorylated at both the serine and threonine residues (Fig. 2 B, middle and right panels). Because the brain lysate used for the purification of the 75-kDa protein was prepared from rats 1 min after ECS, the results suggested that ECS might increase the phosphorylation of moesin in the rat hippocampus. To determine whether this was the case, the moesin in the hippocampal lysates of sham and ECS-treated (1 min) rats were immunoprecipitated with anti-moesin monoclonal antibody and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. We confirmed that the phosphorylation of moesin at both the serine and threonine residues indeed increased in the rat hippocampus 1 min after ECS (Fig. 2 C). Having confirmed that the purified moesin from rat brain was phosphorylated at its serine and threonine residues, we examined the phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558 in the rat hippocampus after ECS. Thr-558 is a well known phosphorylation site of moesin and is shared by other ERM protein family members (Thr-567 in ezrin and Thr-564 in radixin). The rat hippocampal lysates after ECS were examined with the phospho-Thr-558-specific antibody 297S (kindly provided by Professor Tsukita), which can detect all three phosphorylated ERM proteins. The antibody 297S detected at least five proteins in the rat hippocampal lysate. Three protein bands had molecul"

Here, we have used large scale cultures of apoE-expressing cells to purify apoE and prepare apoE containing reconstituted discoidal 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-l-phosphatidylcholine (POPC)-apoE particles. These particles have been used to examine their binding to wild-type and mutant forms of SR-BI expressed in transfected ldlA-7 cells. Specific binding to SR-BI was determined by subtracting from the total binding, nonspecific values measured using either control untransfected ldlA-7 cells or by inhibiting SR-BI-mediated binding with a high titer antireceptor-blocking antibody. POPC-apoE particles generated using apoE2, apoE3, apoE4, or the carboxyl-terminally truncated forms apoE165, apoE202, apoE229, and apoE259 all bound tightly to wild-type SR-BI with similar affinities (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 35–45 μg/ml). Binding was nearly abolished in a cell line expressing the ldlA (Q402R/Q418R) double mutant form of SR-BI that is unable to bind native high density lipoprotein but binds low density lipoprotein normally. The findings establish that apoE is a ligand for SR-BI and that the receptor binding domain is located in the amino-terminal 1–165-region of the protein. SR-BI-apoE interactions may contribute to cholesterol homeostasis in tissues and cells expressing SR-BI that are accessible to apoE-containing lipoproteins."

The overexpression of SIK(N), the SIK's N-terminal kinase domain, repressed the expression of the side chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (CYP11A) gene. To elucidate the mechanism of the repression by SIK, several CYP11A promoter constructs were tested for the promoter activities in the presence of PKA and/or SIK(N). A cAMP-response element (CRE)-like sequence present in the promoter was shown to be responsible not only for the PKA-mediated promoter activation but also for the SIK(N)-mediated repression. When the Gal4 DNA binding domain-linked full-length CRE-binding protein (CREB) construct was cotransfected with Gal4 reporter gene, SIK(N) repressed the PKA-induced reporter gene expression. However, SIK(N) could not repress the PKA-induced reporter activity conferred by Gal4 DNA binding domain-linked basic leucine zipper (bZIP)-less CREB or bZIP-disrupted CREB. On the other hand, SIK(N) could repress the kinase-inducible domain-disrupted CREB-dependent reporter gene expression in the presence of PKA. The in vitro kinase reaction studies showed that SIK(N) could not phosphorylate CREB, and PKA failed to phosphorylate SIK(N). Taken together, these results suggest that SIK(N), cooperating with PKA, may act on the CREB's bZIP domain and repress the CREB-mediated transcriptional activation of the CYP11A gene.

The levels of SIK's mRNA, protein, and kinase activity in Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cells were elevated within 30 min after the ACTH stimulation and returned to the initial levels after a few hours. The initiation of transcription of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein gene and the CYP11A gene appeared to coincide with the decline of the SIK levels (19Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Besides, the transcription of the CYP11A gene failed to occur in ACTH-treated SIK-overexpressing Y1 cells. Moreover, the cAMP-dependent activation of a 2.3-kb-long human CYP11A gene promoter was abolished by the coexpression of SIK (19Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y.

These results suggested that SIK, induced during the early phase of the ACTH stimulation, acted as a negative regulator for the initiation of CYP11A gene transcription. A cAMP-responsive region of the human CYP11A promoter, located at −1.8 to −1.6 kb, contains a cAMP-response element (CRE)-like sequence and a functional Ad4 (SF-1) element, which synergistically confer a full cAMP response upon adrenocortical cells (20Inoue H.

A consensus CRE sequence, TGACGTCA, found in promoter regions of a variety of genes, is one of the major target sites of PKA action (24Andrisani O.M. Crit. Rev.

The CRE is bound by a homo- or heterodimer composed of basic leucine zipper (bZIP)-containing nuclear factors, such as CRE-binding protein (CREB) (28Hoeffler J.P. Meyer T.E. Yun Y. Jameson J.L.

CREB is then phosphorylated by PKA at Ser133 in its kinase-inducible domain (KID), and the phosphorylated CREB becomes capable of binding a coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and ultimately activating the gene transcription (32Brindle P.

The results of reporter assays using several promoter construct-linked reporter genes demonstrated that the site responsible for the repression by SIK was the CRE-like element, the same element acting in the PKA-mediated promoter activation. Further detailed examination suggested that SIK did not phosphorylate CREB during the ACTH stimulation of the cells or in the in vitro kinase assays but inhibited the PKA-dependently activated transcription by acting on the CREB's bZIP domain. Thus, the bZIP domain seemed to play a hitherto unreported role in the transcriptional regulation of the gene. CYP11A reporter plasmids, pS2.3H Luc and 3×[S-RR]SV-CAT (21Takayama K. Morohashi K. Honda S. Hara N. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), were generous gifts from K. Morohashi (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan). The following plasmids were obtained from commercial sources: pIRES1neo, pTAL, and pTAL-CRE from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA); pM and FR-Luc from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); pGL3 and pRL-SV40 from Promega (Madison, WI); and pGEX-6P1 from Amersham Biosciences. The reporters containing human CYP11A promoters were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a luciferase vector pS2.3H Luc as a template. To prepare the −1.8 and −1.5 kb promoter fragments, the −2.3 kb fragment was subjected to PCR by using the following sets of primers: for the −1.8 kb fragment, sense (KpnI −1.8 kb) 5′-AAAGGTACCTCCTTCTGAGGGAGGAATGT and antisense (HindIII) 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTGTGACTGTACCTGCTCCAC; and for the −1.5 kb fragment, sense (KpnI −1.5 kb) 5′-AAAGGTACCGGTTCAACAGTATTGGAGTCT and antisense (HindIII). The amplified products were digested with KpnI andHindIII and introduced into theKpnI/HindIII site of pGL3. A BglII fragment containing three copies of the cAMP-responsive region (−1.8 to −1.6 kb) of the human CYP11A promoter was prepared from 3×[S-RR]SV-CAT and introduced into theBglII site of pTAL. To construct pTAL-3× hCYP11A CRE, an oligonucleotide composed of three copies of CRE, −1653 to −1646, in the CYP11A promoter fragment, 5′-CGCGTTGGCTGATGTCATTCCATTGGCTGATGTCATTCCATTGGCTGATGTCATTCCA/5′GATCTGGAATGACATCAGCCAATGGAATGACATCAGCCAATGGAATGACATCAGCCAA, was annealed and introduced into the MluI/BglII site of pTAL. For pTAL-3× hCYP11A Ad4, an oligonucleotide composed of three copies of Ad4, −1635 to −1630, in the promoter, 5′-CGCGGGCTCAAGGTCATCATGGGCTCAAGGTCATCATGGGCTCAAGGTCATCATG/5′-GATCCATGATGACCTTGAGCCCATGATGACCTTGAGCCCATGATGACCTTGAGCC, was introduced into the MluI/BglII site. ABamHI/XbaI fragment containing five copies of Gal4 elements of FR-Luc was ligated into theBglII/NheI site of pTAL, and the resultant reporter was named pTAL-5× GAL-4. A five-nucleotide substitution at the CRE-like element of the human CYP11A promoter was created by site-directed mutagenesis using a mutagenic primer (5′-CACTGCCTTCCTTGGCTCTAGACATTCCAGGCTCAAGGTC), a pS2.3H Luc template, and a site-directed mutagenesis kit, GeneEditor (Promega). A cDNA fragment of human CREB was amplified by PCR using the primers F primer (5′-GGGAATTCATGGAATCTGGAGCCGAGAAC) and R primer (5′-CCGGATCCCCATTTTCCACCTTAACAGGTGA) from a brain-derived cDNA pool (Multiple ChoiceTM; OriGene Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD). The PCR product was digested by EcoRI/BamHI and ligated into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pM, and the resultant plasmid, that had the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DB) at the N terminus of CREB, was named pM-CREB(F). To prepare a C-terminal truncated CREB vector pM-CREB(S), an XhoI (amino acid residue 297)/SalI (in the 3′-cloning site of pM) fragment encoding the bZIP domain was removed. To prepare the CREB construct having the Gal4 DB at the C-terminal side, a Gal4 DB coding region containing EcoRI and SalI sites was amplified by PCR with aNheI-EcoRI-SalI-linked primer (5′-TAAGCTAGCGAATTCGTCGACATGAAGCTACTGTCTTCTATC) and aHindIII-linked primer (5′-TTTAAGCTTCGGCGATACAGTCAACTGTCT) using pM as a template. The amplified product was digested byNheI/HindIII, and the resultantNheI-EcoRI-SalI/HindIII fragment was replaced with a NheI/HindIII fragment derived from the original pM vector. Into the resultant pM vector a CREB cDNA fragment having no stop codon, prepared by PCR with F primer and R2 primer (5′- GGGTCGACATCTGATTTGTGGCAGTAAAG), was introduced. Mutagenic primers used for the construction of four mutant CREB (K303Q, L311A/L318A, S133A, and DIEDML) vectors were 5′-GAGTGTCGTAGACAGAAGAAAGAATATGTG, 5′-GAATATGTGAAATGTGCAGAAAACAGAGTGGCAGTGGCTGAAAATCAAAATCAAAAC, 5′-GGGAAATTCTTTCAAGGAGGCCTGCCTACAGGAAAATTTTGAATGAC, and 5′-CGAAGGGAAATTCTTTCAGATATCGAGGATATGCTGAAAATTTTGAATGAC, respectively. To express CREB protein in Escherichia coli, aEcoRI/HindIII fragment of pM-CREB(F) was ligated into the EcoRI/HindIII site of a GST fusion vector, pGEX-6P1, and the resultant plasmid was named pGEX-CREB. A bacterial strain BL21 (codon plus) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was transformed by pGEX-CREB, and the expressed CREB was purified as described before with some modifications (19Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The following reagents were obtained from commercial sources: forskolin, fetal calf serum, dithiothreitol (DTT), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride from Sigma; geneticin and trypsin-EDTA from Invitrogen; anti-phospho-Ser133 CREB IgG and anti-CREB IgG for Western blotting from New England Biolabs (Beverly, NJ); anti-CREB IgG for immunoprecipitation from Rockland Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA); and ACTH (Cortrosyn) from Daiichi Seiyaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Y1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air. The method for the reporter assay was described previously (19Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To introduce DNAs into Y1 cells, LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was used in this study. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (34Takemori H. Doi J. Katoh Y. Halder S.K. Lin X.Z. Horike N. Hatano O. Okamoto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used as probes: CRE-like element of the human CYP11A promoter, CYP11A CRE (5′-gTTGGCTGATGTCATTCCA/5′-gTGGAATGACATCAGCCAA) (21Takayama K. Morohashi K. Honda S. Hara N. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); a mutated CRE, CYP11A mCRE (5′-gTTGGCTCTAGACATTCCA/5′-gTGGAATGTCTAGAGCCAA); and a CRE of the human αCG promoter, αCG CRE (5′-gCAAATTGACGTCATGGTAA/5′-gTTACCATGACGTCAATTTG) (35Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The CYP11A CRE was 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment in the presence of cold dATP, dTTP, and dGTP. For each binding assay, the unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (50-fold excess), anti-CREB IgG (6 μl), or anti-SIK IgG (6 μl) was mixed with 10 μg of nuclear extracts in 20 μl of binding buffer composed of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 16 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mm EDTA, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC). The radiolabeled duplex oligonucleotide (50,000 cpm) was added to the mixture, and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The samples were immediately subjected to SDS-PAGE in 5% polyacrylamide gels, and autoradiography was performed by using an intensifying screen. These analytical methods were described previously (19Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 50 mm glycerol 3-phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 14 μg/ml aprotinin) and 3 × SDS sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) were used in this study. Y1 cells (5 × 105 in a 25-cm2 flask) were incubated with 0.1 mCi (3.7 MBq) of 32PO4 in a phosphate-free medium for 2 h, and then the cells were treated with or without 10−6m ACTH for 15 min, washed with 1 ml of PBS, and lysed in 900 μl of lysis buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. The cell lysates were preincubated with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h to eliminate the nonspecific binding. The soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and incubated with 10 μl of anti-CREB IgG and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. After washing the Sepharose beads with 1 ml of lysis buffer four times, proteins bound to IgG-protein A-Sepharose complex were solubilized with 30 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, separated in 15% polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by an autoradiography. Similar experiments were performed for the nonradiolabeled cells to examine total CREB protein level by Western blotting. The catalytic subunit of PKA from bovine heart was purchased from Sigma. GST-SIK(N), GST-SIK(N)K56M and GST-Syntide2 were described previously (19Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PKA (0.5 units) was mixed with 1.0 μCi (37 kBq) of [γ−32P]ATP and substrates (0.1 μg of CREB, GST-SIK(N)K56M, or GST-Syntide2) in 20 μl of PKA reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mmDTT, and 5 mm MgCl2). Reactions were performed at 25 °C for 20 min and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. The reaction mixture was boiled for 5 min, and proteins in 10-μl aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 15% gel. The gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film at room temperature for 1 h. To examine the kinase activity of HA-SIK, 30 μl of the samples were mixed with 10 μl of SIK reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm MnCl2) containing 20 μg of GST-Syntide2 and 1.0 μCi (37 kBq) of [γ−32P]ATP, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. After the addition of 15 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, the reaction mixture was heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and an aliquot (10 μl) was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography as described previously (19Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To identify an element(s) in the CYP11A promoter region that may serve as the target of the SIK’s repressive effect, the 2.3-kb promoter fragment and its truncated derivatives were linked to the luciferase reporter gene. The respective promoter-reporter constructs were introduced into Y1 cells together with PKA expression and/or SIK expression vectors. Because the N-terminal 343-amino acid peptide, the kinase portion, of SIK, SIK(N), produced more prominent repression than the full-length SIK in the cotransfection assays (19Lin X. Takemori H. Katoh Y. Doi J. Horike N. Makino A. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1264-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), SIK(N) was used for the coexpression experiments. When the 2.3- or 1.8-kb fragment-linked reporter gene was expressed in the cells, the coexpression of PKA elevated the reporter activity by about 3–4-fold. This PKA-dependent elevation was completely abrogated by coexpressing SIK(N) (Fig. 1). In contrast, the 1.5-kb fragment’s promoter activity was elevated by only 20% by the addition of PKA, and this PKA-dependently elevated activity was little affected by the coexpression of SIK(N). These results not only confirmed the previous report that the −1.8 to −1.5 kb region contained the cAMP-responsive enhancer composed of a CRE-like element and an Ad4 (SF-1) element (20Inoue H. Watanabe N. Higashi Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Takayama K. Morohashi K. Honda S. Hara N. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Hu M.C. Hsu N.C. Pai C.I. Wang C.K. Chung B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) but also suggested that the region might also contain the major target site of the SIK’s repressive effect. (It has been noted that the coexpression of SIK(N) alone seemed to produce about 20–30% inhibition in the basal promoter activity, but this issue will be further investigated elsewhere.) To determine precisely which element within the enhancer is important for the SIK-mediated repression of promoter activity, three chimeric luciferase reporter genes, each of which had three tandemly repeated promoter sequences of the enhancer, CRE-like element, or Ad4 (SF-1) element, respectively, were constructed (Fig.2A). The reporter gene containing the enhancers or CRE-like elements was clearly activated by PKA. And the PKA-dependently elevated reporter activity was completely abrogated by the coexpression of SIK(N). The reporter gene containing the Ad4 (SF-1) elements, however, was not influenced by the coexpression of PKA, SIK(N), or PKA and SIK(N) together. These results suggested that the CRE-like sequence in the enhancer might be the major target site upon which SIK exerted its repressive effect. To further confirm the above point, the CRE-like element in the 2.3-kb fragment was mutated, and the promoter activity of the mutated fragment was compared with that of the wild-type fragment (Fig. 2B). The addition of forskolin activated the wild-type promoter by about 2-fold, and this activation was completely abrogated by the coexpression of SIK(N). On the other hand, the extent of activation by forskolin of the mutated promoter was only 20%, and this slight activation was not significantly affected by the coexpression of SIK(N). These results supported the notion that SIK might repress the ACTH/cAMP/PKA-induced CYP11A promoter activity by acting on the CRE-like element, the same element that was responsible for the transcriptional activation. To gain further insight into the target site of PKA's, as well as SIK's, action, nuclear factors that possibly bound to the CRE-like element during the transcriptional activation of the CYP11A gene were characterized. To do that, a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the CRE-like sequence was mixed with nuclear extracts prepared from Y1 cells or SIK-overexpressing Y1 cells, and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses were performed. Several radioactive bands appeared in the lanes of both Y1 extracts and SIK-overexpressing Y1 extracts, indicating the complex formation between the nuclear proteins and the oligonucleotide (Fig.3A). The addition of a nonradiolabeled self-oligonucleotide or a human chorionic gonadotropin gene-derived CRE completely inhibited the complex formation, but the addition of a mutated CYP11A-CRE did not. It should be noted that the pattern of radioactive bands produced from the Y1 extracts was similar to that from the SIK-overexpressing Y1 extracts. Because we have evidence that SIK protein was present both in the nucleus and in the cytosol of Y1 cells, 2H. Takemori, Y. Katoh, J. Doi, N. Horike, X. Lin, and M. Okamoto, manuscript in preparation. these results suggest that the presence of SIK protein in the nuclear extracts could not influence the DNA-protein complex formation. Based on the above results and the previous reports (36Watanabe N. Inoue H. Fujii Kuriyama Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Chung B.C. Guo I.C.

White P.C. Rainey W.E. Endocr. Res. 2000; 26: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we surmised that the major nuclear factor involved in the DNA-protein complex formation might be CREB. To confirm this, an antibody against CREB was added to the incubation mixtures, and the mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3B, the presence of the antibody shifted the major band of DNA-protein complex to the upper position. Again, no difference was seen between the Y1 and the SIK-overexpressing Y1 extracts. On the other hand, the addition of an antibody against SIK protein little influenced the positions of DNA-protein complexes. Next, nuclear extracts were prepared from the cells that had been treated with, or without, ACTH. The electrophoretic mobility shift pattern of the extracts from ACTH-treated cells resembled that from the control cells, and no difference was seen between the Y1 and the SIK-overexpressing Y1 extracts (Fig.3C). Taken together, these results indicate that CREB may be the major nuclear factor in Y1 cells that binds to the CRE-like element in the CYP11A promoter, and SIK may not directly interact with the CRE·CREB complex. CREB-mediated transcription is regulated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ser133 in the KID domain of CREB (40Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). The question was asked whether or not SIK could phosphorylate CREB and influence its transcriptional activity. GST-SIK(N) was incubated with a recombinant CREB expressed in E. coli or GST-Syntide2, a SIK synthetic peptide substrate, in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 4A, the results of autoradiographic as well as immunoblot analyses of the incubation mixture indicated that GST-SIK(N) could not phosphorylate CREB, although the same dose of GST-SIK(N) could well phosphorylate GST-Syntide2. On the other hand, in the incubation mixture of PKA with CREB the Ser133-phosphorylated CREB was detected as expected. Although GST-Syntide2 does not have the consensus phosphorylation motif for PKA, the peptide appeared to be a good substrate of PKA. Next, CREB's phosphorylation levels in the normal, or ACTH-stimulated, Y1 cells and SIK-overexpressing Y1 cells were examined (Fig.4B). Y1 cells prelabeled with 32PO4were incubated with ACTH for 15 min, and then CREB in the cell lysates was analyzed after the immnoprecipitation. A radiolabeled 42-kDa protein (pCREB) was specifically precipitated by anti-CREB antibody, and its radioactivity was elevated by the ACTH treatment. The levels of phosphorylation of pCREB in the SIK-overexpressing Y1 cells were apparently the same as those in the normal Y1 cells. It should be mentioned here that during the immunoprecipitation experiments we could detect no evidence suggesting direct interaction between SIK and CREB. Last, by using anti-phospho-CREB antibody, the extents of Ser133 phosphorylation in the ACTH-treated Y1 cells and SIK-overexpressing Y1 cells were examined (Fig. 4C). The antibody used in this experiment could also detect the phosphorylated form of CREB-related transcriptional factor ATF-1. In the ACTH-treated Y1 cells, the levels of phospho-CREB and phospho-ATF-1 elevated within 7.5"

Three subunits (CcoN, CcoO, and CcoP) comprise the catalytic “core” complex required for the reduction of O2 and the oxidation of a c-type cytochrome. On the other hand, the functional role of subunit IV (CcoQ) of the cbb3 oxidase was not obvious, although we previously suggested that it is involved in the signal transduction pathway controlling photosynthesis gene expression (Oh, J. I., and Kaplan, S. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 2688–2696). Here we go on to demonstrate that subunit IV protects the core complex, in the presence of O2, from proteolytic degradation by a serine metalloprotease. In the absence of CcoQ, we suggest that the presence of O2 leads to the loss of heme from the core complex, which destabilizes the cbb3 oxidase into a “degradable” form, perhaps by altering its conformation. Under aerobic conditions the absence of CcoQ appears to affect the CcoP subunit most severely. It was further demonstrated, using a series of COOH-terminal deletion derivatives of CcoQ, that the minimum length of CcoQ required for stabilization of the core complex under aerobic conditions is the amino-terminal ∼48–50 amino acids.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5514-5517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Subunits I and II form the functional unit containing all of the redox centers. These consist of a low spin heme and a binuclear center composed of a high spin heme and CuB in subunit I, and CuA in subunit II, as well as amino acid residues required for enzyme activity and proton translocation. Subunit III appears not to be essential for catalytic function of the enzyme because a functional two-subunit enzyme consisting of subunits I and II has been demonstrated (8Ludwig B. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the removal of subunit III leads to “suicide inactivation” of the enzyme during turnover (9Bratton M.R. Pressler M.A. Hosler J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16236-16245Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The function of the smallest subunit IV is unknown. Deletion of the gene encoding subunit IV (CtaH in Paracoccus denitrificans) was shown to have no effect on either the integrity of the enzyme complex or its spectral and enzymatic properties (7Witt H. Ludwig B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5514-5517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).The cbb3 cytochrome c oxidase encoded by the ccoNOQP (fixNOQP) operon is also composed of four subunits (10Zufferey R. Arslan E. Thöny-Meyer L. Hennecke H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6452-6459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Toledo-Cuevas M. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Wikstrom M. Garcia-Horsman J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The ccoN (fixN) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the oxidase, which is homologous to subunit I of the aa3 oxidase. TheccoO (fixO) and ccoP (fixP) genes encode membrane-bound mono- and diheme cytochromes c. On the basis of determined redox potentials, it was suggested that electrons are transferred from cytochrome c to CcoN via CcoP and CcoO in that order (12Gray K.A. Grooms M. Myllykallio H. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3120-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). CcoN, CcoO, and CcoP subunits are all required for catalytic activity of the cbb3oxidase (13Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Oh J.I. Kaplan S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4237-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Elimination of any redox prosthetic center by site-directed mutagenesis was shown to lead to the loss of enzyme activity and a defect in enzyme assembly (14Oh J.I. Kaplan S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4237-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The CcoQ (FixQ) is the smallest subunit of the cbb3 oxidase, consisting of 48–73 amino acids depending upon its source. Its primary structure shows a basal level of homology to subunit IV (CtaH) of theaa3 oxidase in the membrane-spanning helix region. In-frame deletion of the ccoQ gene was demonstrated to affect neither the catalytic properties nor the assembly of the enzyme complex in R. sphaeroides when examined in cells grown anaerobically (5Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This is also true for Bradyrhizobium japonicum (13Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).We have shown the cbb3 oxidase to play an additional role as an redox sensor in a signal transduction pathway. Electron flow through the cbb3 oxidase is postulated to generate a signal under aerobic conditions, which is inhibitory to and mediated by the PrrBA two-component activation system and which leads to the repression of photosynthesis (PS)1 gene expression (14Oh J.I. Kaplan S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4237-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,15O'Gara J.P. Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4044-4050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a ccoQ in-frame deletion mutant of R. sphaeroides grown under anaerobic conditions retains a catalytically intact cbb3 oxidase, under highly aerobic conditions it produces spectral complexes accompanied by the aerobic derepression of PS genes, as observed for Cco null mutants (5Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Based upon these observations, we initially suggested that CcoQ was involved in the process of actually transducing the inhibitory signal from the cbb3 oxidase to the PrrBA two-component system (5Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, further study of the role of CcoQ reveals a more subtle mode of action, leading us to suggest that the CcoQ subunit stabilizes the cbb3 oxidase complex under aerobic conditions and, in its absence, the core complex is destabilized, thereby removing the inhibitory signal. We report these findings here.DISCUSSIONBacterial quinol and cytochrome c oxidases belonging to the heme-copper superfamily are generally composed of four different subunits. The smallest subunit IV differs in size and membrane topology depending on the type of oxidase. The aa3cytochrome c oxidase from P. denitrificanscontains subunit IV (CtaH) with a single membrane-spanning helix (6Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). This is also the case for the cbb3 cytochromec oxidase (11Toledo-Cuevas M. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Wikstrom M. Garcia-Horsman J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, subunit IV of the well studiedbo3 quinol oxidase of E. coli has three membrane-spanning helices and is larger than those corresponding to the aa3 and cbb3cytochrome c oxidases (22Chepuri V. Au L. Lemieux D.C. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11185-11192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chepuri V. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12978-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the three-dimensional crystal structures of the P. denitrificans aa3 cytochrome c oxidase (6Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar) and theE. coli bo3 quinol oxidase (24Abramson J. Riistama S. Larsson G. Jasaitis A. Svensson-Ek M. Laakkonen L. Puustinen A. Iwata S. Wikstrom M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), subunit IV is positioned in the cleft between subunits I and III. However, the crystal structure of the mitochondrial aa3cytochrome c oxidase consisting of 13 different subunits reveals no obvious counterpart to the bacterial subunit IV (25Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar).The removal of subunit IV from the bo3 quinol oxidase leads to inactivation of the enzyme and defects in the heme-copper binuclear center of subunit I (26Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Likewise, a deletion of the Bacillus subtilis qoxD encoding subunit IV of theaa3 menaquinol oxidase was shown to significantly reduce respiration and proton pumping (27Villani G. Tattoli M. Capitanio N. Glaser P. Papa S. Danchin A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of ctaH in P. denitrificans was reported to have no effect on the spectral and enzymatic properties of theaa3 cytochrome c oxidase (7Witt H. Ludwig B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5514-5517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).In this report, we first demonstrated that subunit IV (CcoQ) of thecbb3 cytochrome c oxidase plays a role in protecting the cbb3 oxidase under aerobic conditions. The rationale for this argument is as follows. (i) Subunit abundance and cbb3 oxidase activity in the CCOQΔ mutant were significantly reduced under aerobic growth conditions (2 and 30% O2), but not under anaerobic dark Me2SO or photosynthetic conditions (5Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) when compared with measurements of the wild-type strain grown under the same conditions. (ii) The activity of the cbb3 oxidase in cell-free crude extracts of the CCOQΔ mutant was unstable when exposed to air, whereas the cbb3 activity in cell-free crude extracts of the wild type was stable under the same experimental conditions. (iii) When the purified core enzyme and holoenzymes were compared regarding their stability in the presence of air, the absence of CcoQ was directly related to the stability of both the CcoP and CcoO subunits, as well as the heme content of these subunits. Reducing conditions resulting from the removal of air and the addition of ascorbate stabilized the hemes of the core enzyme.The absence of CcoQ appears to affect the CcoP subunit of thecbb3 oxidase most severely under oxidizing conditions, as judged by the following observations. (i) The most significant reduction in the heme content was observed for CcoP of the purified core enzyme (see Fig. 2, A and C). The stoichiometry of CcoP to CcoN and CcoO in the purified core enzyme is altered compared with that of the holoenzyme (see Fig. 2A). (ii) The level of CcoP in the membranes of the CCOQΔ mutant grown under aerobic conditions was most severely affected (see Fig.1A). (iii) In vitro stability tests showed that the loss of heme from CcoP of the purified core enzyme occurred to the greatest extent compared with the other subunits (see Fig.4A).In addition, our data suggest that a serine metalloprotease activity is related to the instability of the cbb3 core complex lacking the CcoQ subunit. The proteolytic degradation of the core enzyme occurred only in the presence of O2, indicating that the presence of O2 triggers the degradation process of the core enzyme lacking the CcoQ subunit. At this point we are faced with the question of why the core enzyme is degraded only under oxidizing conditions. A plausible answer can be drawn from the observation that, although the purified core oxidase consists of the same three subunits having the same molecular mass as those of the holoenzyme, it shows decreased levels of heme b as well as heme c when compared with the same amount of the holoenzyme (see Fig. 2, A and C). This finding leads us to hypothesize that, in the presence of O2, the loss of the heme moieties in the core oxidase occurred prior to degradation of the apoproteins, i.e. the loss of heme would be expected to convert the cbb3 oxidase into a conformationally altered, degradable protein, which presumably becomes susceptible to proteolysis.The complementation experiments using a series of COOH-terminal deletion derivatives of CcoQ demonstrated that the minimum length of CcoQ required for stabilizing the cbb3 oxidase under aerobic conditions is ∼48–50 amino acids. All CcoQ homologues that have been so far identified consist of 48–73 amino acids, implying that the minimum size of the functional CcoQ homologues may correspond to the 48-amino acid CcoQ homologues when these are multiply aligned (see Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5A, there are a number of conserved amino acid residues in the first 48 amino acids. It is possible that an analysis of these may shed light on the mechanism of CcoQ protection of the core complex, perhaps through an alteration of its binding to the core enzyme.The cbb3 cytochrome c oxidase ofR. sphaeroides has multiple functions, i.e. as a terminal oxidase in the presence of O2 (19Garcia-Horsman J.A. Berry E. Shapleigh J.P. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), as an O2/redox sensor (1Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Oh J.I. Kaplan S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4237-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and finally as a conduit for reducing power under anaerobic conditions (5Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions the cbb3 oxidase generates the signal that is transmitted to the PrrBA two-component system, most likely via PrrC, to repress PS gene expression (1Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15O'Gara J.P. Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4044-4050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the cbb3 oxidase does not sense O2 itself, but it is the extent of electron flow through the oxidase that serves to generate the inhibitory signal (14Oh J.I. Kaplan S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4237-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The greater the volume of electron flow through thecbb3 oxidase, the stronger the inhibitory signal generated by the oxidase to shift the equilibrium of PrrB activity toward the phosphatase mode and away from kinase mode, resulting in the absence of activation of PS genes. Therefore, under aerobic conditions where the substrate for the cbb3 oxidase (O2) is sufficient, PS genes are not induced. The complementation experiment using the truncated forms of CcoQ reconfirms that the functional state (activity) of the cbb3oxidase is inversely related to the extent of aerobic derepression of those PS genes that are under the control of the PrrBA two-component system.Although the CCOQΔ mutant has near-normal cbb3oxidase activity under anaerobic photosynthetic and dark Me2SO conditions, it produces significant levels of the spectral complexes under highly aerobic conditions like the various Cco null mutant strains (5Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This phenotype originally suggested to us that the CcoQ subunit was part of the signaling pathway from thecbb3 oxidase to the PrrBA two-component system. However, noting the stabilizing effect of CcoQ on thecbb3 oxidase in the presence of O2, as described here, provides an alternative explanation. Thecbb3 oxidase, as we have shown, is severely affected in both its cellular levels and activity in the CCOQΔ mutant grown under aerobic conditions. This destabilization of the alteredcbb3 oxidase attenuates the inhibitory signal to the PrrBA two-component system, resulting in the aerobic formation of the spectral complexes.The cbb3 cytochrome c oxidase is considered to be a primitive form of terminal oxidase. It is suggested that the cbb3 oxidase evolved from the anaerobic enzyme, NO reductase on the basis of the similarity in the catalytic subunit and heme composition (3Garcia-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Ma J. Rumbley J. Gennis R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5587-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The high affinity of thecbb3 oxidase for O2 leads us to hypothesize that this form of oxidase evolved during the transition period from an anoxygenic to an oxygenic atmosphere to enable the more efficient aerobic respiration. However, such an “anaerobic” enzyme system might have been sensitive to oxygen even at low levels. Therefore, subunit IV might have been “recruited” to protect the enzyme complex from oxidative damage. If the aa3cytochrome c oxidase evolved from acbb3-type oxidase, subunit IV of the bacterialaa3 oxidase may be an “evolutionary remnant.” The purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacterium,Rhodobacter sphaeroides, contains a branched respiratory electron transport chain that is terminated with at least two cytochrome c oxidases and at least one functional quinol oxidase (Qxt) (1Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aa3- andcbb3-type cytochrome c oxidases, both belonging to the heme-copper oxidase superfamily, catalyze the reduction of molecular oxygen to water using electrons derived from the oxidation of cytochromes c2 andcy (2Donohue T.J. McEwan A.G. Van Doren S. Crofts A.R. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1918-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Garcia-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Ma J. Rumbley J. Gennis R.B. J.

A. 1999; 96: 4348-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In R. sphaeroides theaa3 oxidase is the major cytochrome coxidase under highly aerobic conditions, whereas thecbb3 oxidase is the predominant and perhaps exclusive cytochrome c oxidase under oxygen-limiting and anaerobic conditions, respectively (5Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The bacterial aa3 cytochrome coxidase has been demonstrated both genetically and from x-ray crystallographic analyses to consist of four subunits (6Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar, 7Witt H. Ludwig B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5514-5517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Subunits I and II form the functional unit containing all of the redox centers. These consist of a low spin heme and a binuclear center composed of a high spin heme and CuB in subunit I, and CuA in subunit II, as well as amino acid residues required for enzyme activity and proton translocation. Subunit III appears not to be essential for catalytic function of the enzyme because a functional two-subunit enzyme consisting of subunits I and II has been demonstrated (8Ludwig B. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).

Slaughter C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3120-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). CcoN, CcoO, and CcoP subunits are all required for catalytic activity of the cbb3oxidase (13Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol.

In contrast, subunit IV of the well studiedbo3 quinol oxidase of E. coli has three membrane-spanning helices and is larger than those corresponding to the aa3 and cbb3cytochrome c oxidases (22Chepuri V.

Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Likewise, a deletion of the Bacillus subtilis qoxD encoding subunit IV of theaa3 menaquinol oxidase was shown to significantly reduce respiration and proton pumping (27Villani G. Tattoli M. Capitanio N. Glaser P. Papa S. Danchin A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of ctaH in P. denitrificans was reported to have no effect on the spectral and enzymatic properties of theaa3 cytochrome c oxidase (7Witt H. Ludwig B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5514-5517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).In this report, we first demonstrated that subunit IV (CcoQ) of thecbb3 cytochrome c oxidase plays a role in protecting the cbb3 oxidase under aerobic conditions. The rationale for this argument is as follows. (i) Subunit abundance and cbb3 oxidase activity in the CCOQΔ mutant were significantly reduced under aerobic growth conditions (2 and 30% O2), but not under anaerobic dark Me2SO or photosynthetic conditions (5Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) when compared with measurements of the wild-type strain grown under the same conditions. (ii) The activity of the cbb3 oxidase in cell-free crude extracts of the CCOQΔ mutant was unstable when exposed to air, whereas the cbb3 activity in cell-free crude extracts of the wild type was stable under the same experimental conditions. (iii) When the purified core enzyme and holoenzymes were compared regarding their stability in the presence of air, the absence of CcoQ was directly related to the stability of both the CcoP and CcoO subunits, as well as the heme content of these subunits. Reducing conditions resulting from the removal of air and the addition of ascorbate stabilized the hemes of the core enzyme.The absence of CcoQ appears to affect the CcoP subunit of thecbb3 oxidase most severely under oxidizing conditions, as judged by the following observations. (i) The most significant reduction in the heme content was observed for CcoP of the purified core enzyme (see Fig. 2, A and C). The stoichiometry of CcoP to CcoN and CcoO in the purified core enzyme is altered compared with that of the holoenzyme (see Fig. 2A). (ii) The level of CcoP in the membranes of the CCOQΔ mutant grown under aerobic conditions was most severely affected (see Fig.1A). (iii) In vitro stability tests showed that the loss of heme from CcoP of the purified core enzyme occurred to the greatest extent compared with the other subunits (see Fig.4A).In addition, our data suggest that a serine metalloprotease activity is related to the instability of the cbb3 core complex lacking the CcoQ subunit. The proteolytic degradation of the core enzyme occurred only in the presence of O2, indicating that the presence of O2 triggers the degradation process of the core enzyme lacking the CcoQ subunit. At this point we are faced with the question of why the core enzyme is degraded only under oxidizing conditions. A plausible answer can be drawn from the observation that, although the purified core oxidase consists of the same three subunits having the same molecular mass as those of the holoenzyme, it shows decreased levels of heme b as well as heme c when compared with the same amount of the holoenzyme (see Fig. 2, A and C). This finding leads us to hypothesize that, in the presence of O2, the loss of the heme moieties in the core oxidase occurred prior to degradation of the apoproteins, i.e. the loss of heme would be expected to convert the cbb3 oxidase into a conformationally altered, degradable protein, which presumably becomes susceptible to proteolysis.The complementation experiments using a series of COOH-terminal deletion derivatives of CcoQ demonstrated that the minimum length of CcoQ required for stabilizing the cbb3 oxidase under aerobic conditions is ∼48–50 amino acids. All CcoQ homologues that have been so far identified consist of 48–73 amino acids, implying that the minimum size of the functional CcoQ homologues may correspond to the 48-amino acid CcoQ homologues when these are multiply aligned (see Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5A, there are a number of conserved amino acid residues in the first 48 amino acids. It is possible that an analysis of these may shed light on the mechanism of CcoQ protection of the core complex, perhaps through an alteration of its binding to the core enzyme.The cbb3 cytochrome c oxidase ofR. sphaeroides has multiple functions, i.e. as a terminal oxidase in the presence of O2 (19Garcia-Horsman J.A. Berry E. Shapleigh J.P. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), as an O2/redox sensor (1Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Oh J.I. Kaplan S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4237-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and finally as a conduit for reducing power under anaerobic conditions (5Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions the cbb3 oxidase generates the signal that is transmitted to the PrrBA two-component system, most likely via PrrC, to repress PS gene expression (1Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15O'Gara J.P. Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4044-4050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the cbb3 oxidase does not sense O2 itself, but it is the extent of electron flow through the oxidase that serves to generate the inhibitory signal (14Oh J.I. Kaplan S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4237-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The greater the volume of electron flow through thecbb3 oxidase, the stronger the inhibitory signal generated by the oxidase to shift the equilibrium of PrrB activity toward the phosphatase mode and away from kinase mode, resulting in the absence of activation of PS genes. Therefore, under aerobic conditions where the substrate for the cbb3 oxidase (O2) is sufficient, PS genes are not induced. The complementation experiment using the truncated forms of CcoQ reconfirms that the functional state (activity) of the cbb3oxidase is inversely related to the extent of aerobic derepression of those PS genes that are under the control of the PrrBA two-component system.Although the CCOQΔ mutant has near-normal cbb3oxidase activity under anaerobic photosynthetic and dark Me2SO conditions, it produces significant levels of the spectral complexes under highly aerobic conditions like the various Cco null mutant strains (5Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This phenotype originally suggested to us that the CcoQ subunit was part of the signaling pathway from thecbb3 oxidase to the PrrBA two-component system. However, noting the stabilizing effect of CcoQ on thecbb3 oxidase in the presence of O2, as described here, provides an alternative explanation. Thecbb3 oxidase, as we have shown, is severely affected in both its cellular levels and activity in the CCOQΔ mutant grown under aerobic conditions. This destabilization of the alteredcbb3 oxidase attenuates the inhibitory signal to the PrrBA two-component system, resulting in the aerobic formation of the spectral complexes.The cbb3 cytochrome c oxidase is considered to be a primitive form of terminal oxidase. It is suggested that the cbb3 oxidase evolved from the anaerobic enzyme, NO reductase on the basis of the similarity in the catalytic subunit and heme composition (3Garcia-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Ma J. Rumbley J. Gennis R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5587-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The high affinity of thecbb3 oxidase for O2 leads us to hypothesize that this form of oxidase evolved during the transition period from an anoxygenic to an oxygenic atmosphere to enable the more efficient aerobic respiration. However, such an “anaerobic” enzyme system might have been sensitive to oxygen even at low levels. Therefore, subunit IV might have been “recruited” to protect the enzyme complex from oxidative damage. If the aa3cytochrome c oxidase evolved from acbb3-type oxidase, subunit IV of the bacterialaa3 oxidase may be an “evolutionary remnant.” Bacterial quinol and cytochrome c oxidases belonging to the heme-copper superfamily are generally composed of four different subunits. The smallest subunit IV differs in size and membrane topology depending on the type of oxidase. The aa3cytochrome c oxidase from P. denitrificanscontains subunit IV (CtaH) with a single membrane-spanning helix (6Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). This is also the case for the cbb3 cytochromec oxidase (11Toledo-Cuevas M. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Wikstrom M. Garcia-Horsman J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, subunit IV of the well studiedbo3 quinol oxidase of E. coli has three membrane-spanning helices and is larger than those corresponding to the aa3 and cbb3cytochrome c oxidases (22Chepuri V. Au L. Lemieux D.C. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11185-11192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chepuri V. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12978-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the three-dimensional crystal structures of the P. denitrificans aa3 cytochrome c oxidase (6Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar) and theE. coli bo3 quinol oxidase (24Abramson J. Riistama S. Larsson G. Jasaitis A. Svensson-Ek M. Laakkonen L. Puustinen A. Iwata S. Wikstrom M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), subunit IV is positioned in the cleft between subunits I and III. However, the crystal structure of the mitochondrial aa3cytochrome c oxidase consisting of 13 different subunits reveals no obvious counterpart to the bacterial subunit IV (25Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). The removal of subunit IV from the bo3 quinol oxidase leads to inactivation of the enzyme and defects in the heme-copper binuclear center of subunit I (26Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Likewise, a deletion of the Bacillus subtilis qoxD encoding subunit IV of theaa3 menaquinol oxidase was shown to significantly reduce respiration and proton pumping (27Villani G. Tattoli M. Capitanio N. Glaser P. Papa S. Danchin A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of ctaH in P. denitrificans was reported to have no effect on the spectral and enzymatic properties of theaa3 cytochrome c oxidase (7Witt H. Ludwig B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5514-5517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this report, we first demonstrated that subunit IV (CcoQ) of thecbb3 cytochrome c oxidase plays a role in protecting the cbb3 oxidase under aerobic conditions. The rationale for this argument is as follows. (i) Subunit abundance and cbb3 oxidase activity in the CCOQΔ mutant were significantly reduced under aerobic growth conditions (2 and 30% O2), but not under anaerobic dark Me2SO or photosynthetic conditions (5Oh J.I. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) when compared with measurements of the wild-type strain grown under the same conditions. (ii) The activity of the cbb3 oxidase in cell-free crude extracts of the CCOQΔ mutant was unstable when exposed to air, whereas the cbb3 activity in cell-free crude extracts of the wild type was stable under the same experimental conditions. (iii) When the purified core enzyme and holoenzymes were compared regarding their stability in the presence of air, the absence of CcoQ was directly related to the stability of both the CcoP and CcoO subunits, as well as the heme content of these subunits. Reducing conditions resulting from the removal of air and the addition of ascorbate stabilized the hemes of the core enzyme. The absence of CcoQ appears to affect the CcoP subunit of thecbb3 oxidase most severely under oxidizing conditions, as judged by the following observations. (i) The most significant reduction in the heme content was observed for CcoP of the purified core enzyme (see Fig. 2, A and C). The stoichiometry of CcoP to CcoN and CcoO in the purified core enzyme is altered compared with that of the holoenzyme (see Fig. 2A). (ii) The level of CcoP in the membranes of the CCOQΔ mutant grown under aerobic conditions was most severely affected (see Fig.1A). (iii) In vitro stability tests showed that the loss of heme from CcoP of the purified core enzyme occurred to the greatest extent compared with the other subunits (see Fig.4A). In addition, our data suggest that a serine metalloprotease activity is related to the instability of the cbb3 core complex lacking the CcoQ subunit. The proteolytic degradation of the core enzyme occurred only in the presence of O2, indicating that the presence of O2 triggers the degradation process of the core enzyme lacking the CcoQ subunit. At this point we are faced with the question of why the core enzyme is degraded only under oxidizing conditions.

In this study, we found that TNF induced G1 arrest of TF-1 and MV4–11 cells while simultaneously causing apoptosis. Treatment of the cells with TNF for 48 h caused cell cycle arrest, accompanied by dephosphorylation of pRb and reduction in D-type cyclin expression. The down-regulation of the D-type cyclins resulted in ∼50–80% decrease of the cyclin-dependent kinase activities. Cells treated with calpain-dependent inhibitor ALLN and apoptosis inhibitor zVAD-FMK suppressed degradation of IκBα and activation of caspase 3, respectively. However, treatment of cells with these two inhibitors was not able to prevent TNF-induced down-regulation of the D-type cyclins. In contrast, proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and lactacystin blocked both TNF-induced degradation of IκBα and down-regulation of D-type cyclins. These data suggest that down-regulation of D-type cyclins by TNF may be proteasome-proteolysis dependent. Additional support for this conclusion was obtained from experiments showing an increase of proteasome activity in TNF-treated cells and in vitro degradation of cyclin D3 by 26 S proteasome.

Moore P.B. Rose S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). During early apoptosis, a family of cysteine proteases, the caspases, is activated. The pathway from TNF receptor to initial caspase activation is reasonably well characterized. Unlike apoptosis, necrosis is not an energy-requiring process and is a less ordered event resulting in cell swelling or shrinkage and disruption of the plasma membrane (9.Leist M. Single B.

Cell. 1972; 74: 845-849Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1163) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic and nuclear events in response to TNF is not clear at all. There is no evidence suggesting that the growth inhibition of these hematopoietic cells is a result of TNF-induced apoptosis or necrosis. Cytoplasmic protease systems have recently been identified as important regulators of intracellular activities including programmed cell death, protein kinase activities, and cell-cycle progression (12.Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 13.Pahl H. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Opin.

A typical example is the degradation of IκBα during TNF-induced apoptosis. Degradation of IκBα leads to activation of transcription factor NF-κB, which is required for TNF-regulated gene expression and downstream activities (15.Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 16.Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These previous studies prompted us to investigate the mechanism by which TNF suppresses proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells. We used two myeloid leukemia cell lines, TF-1 and MV4–11, as model systems in our studies, since they are very sensitive to TNF treatment. TF-1 is a growth factor-dependent human erythroid cell line that originally was isolated from the bone marrow cells of a patient with erythroleukemia. Since the TF-1 cell line expressed various cytokines and cytokine receptors and is sensitive to TNF inhibitory effect, this cell line has been a well established model for studying apoptosis, differentiation, and cytokine-regulated gene expression. MV4–11 is a growth factor-independent myeloid leukemia cell line isolated from a child with acute myeloid leukemia. Our previous studies demonstrated that this cell line is very sensitive to TGFβ-induced G1arrest (18.Hu X. Cress D.W. Zhong Q. Zuckerman K.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have now found that this cell line is also sensitive to TNF-induced cell cycle arrest. Our data showed that TNF caused a significant reduction of D-type cyclins and induced G1arrest in both TF-1 and MV4–11 cells. The down-regulation of the D-type cyclins is a result of proteasome-dependent degradation. Antibodies used and their sources were as follows: antibodies to IκBα, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2), cdk4, cdk6, cyclin A, cyclin E, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, p27, and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); pRb, phosphorylated pRb, and luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI).

TNT Transcription/Translation kits were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). pRc/CMV/cyclin D3 was a generous gift of Dr. Armando Felsani (CNR, Istituto Tecnologie Biomediche, Roma, Italy). Human TF-1 and MV4–11 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). These cell lines were routinely maintained in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 (for TF-1) and Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (for MV4–11) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the absence (for MV4–11) or presence (for TF-1) of 5 ng/ml GM-CSF. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Before treatment with TNF, exponentially growing cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in RPMI 1640 with 1 ng/ml GM-CSF (For TF-1) or Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. In some experiments, exponentially growing cells were pretreated with inhibitors of caspase 3, proteasome, or calpain for 30 min at 37 °C, after which TNF was added and the incubation was continued for the times required. Cells in log-phase growth were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and re-cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for the times required in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Subsequently, 2 ml of methanol were added and the cells were incubated for 30 min on ice. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μl of propidium iodide (0.1 mg/ml) and 100 μl of RNase A (2 mg/ml) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature, after which DNA content was determined using a flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Whole lysates and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (19.Hu X. Janssen W.E. Moscinski L.C. Bryington M. Dangsup A. Rezai-Zadeh N. Babbin B.A. Zuckerman K.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6290-6296PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, lysates containing 500 μg of total proteins were incubated with an appropriate antibody (1–2 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight with agitation at 4 °C. About 30 μl of protein A- or protein G-agarose beads were added to the lysates and the incubation continued for another 2 h at the same conditions. Immune complexes were then collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer (18.Hu X. Cress D.W. Zhong Q. Zuckerman K.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and resuspended in 2 × SDS sample buffer (125 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% bromphenol blue). Lysates in sample buffer were analyzed for the expression of proteins by Western blotting (18.Hu X. Cress D.W. Zhong Q. Zuckerman K.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and detected by a chemiluminescence (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). For direct Western blotting, lysates containing 30–50 μg of total proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels followed by Western blotting procedure (18.Hu X. Cress D.W. Zhong Q. Zuckerman K.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Preclarified lysates (200 μg of total protein) extracted from cells treated with or without TNF were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with an antibody against cyclin or cdk followed by addition of protein G-agarose beads for 2 h. The lysates were collected by centrifugation and washed. After three washes in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and two washes in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol), the kinase reaction was carried out in a total volume of 10 μl, which included 5 μl of 2 × kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 2 μg of GST-Rb at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 2 × sample buffer and boiling for 4 min before separation by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then dried and exposed to film (Kodak XAR-5). Cells were treated with or without TNF for different times. One hour prior to harvesting, culture medium was replaced with methionine-free medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. Cells were then collected and cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer. An equal amount of protein from each sample were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against cyclins D2 or D3 followed by addition of protein G-agarose. Subsequently, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. For pulse-chase experiments, cells treated with or without TNF for 48 h were collected and resuspended in normal culture medium containing [35S]methionine for 1 h, at 37 °C, after which the labeling medium were removed and cells were incubated in the presence of an excess of nonradioactive methionine for 1–4 h. Cells were then collected, cell lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitated with an antibody against cyclins D2 or D3 following the procedure described above. In vitroprotease activity assays were performed as described previously (20.Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar), with slight modification. Preclarified lysates (200 μg of total protein) extracted from cells treated with or without TNF were incubated with peptide-AMC substrate (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)-containing reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2) in the presence or absence of the indicated protease inhibitor (30 min, 30 °C). Fluorescent product, AMC, released from the reaction, were quantitated by measuring fluorescence emission intensity at 440 nm. Transcription and translation of pRC/CMV/cyclin D3 using TNT reticulocyte lysate (Promega) were performed following the manufacturer's instruction without 35S labeling. Translation products were incubated in 1 × ubiquitin reaction buffer, which contained ATP, E1, E2, and E3, at 37 °C for 2 h, after which the reaction product were transfer to quenching buffer (10% trichloroacetic acid, 200 μl of 5% bovine serum albumin) followed by addition of 26 S proteasome fractions (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The degradation reaction was performed at 37 °C for 1–1.5 h following the manufacturer's instruction. After reaction, aliquots of reaction mixture were loaded to SDS-PAGE and the expression of cyclin D3 was analyzed by Western blot with a specific antibody against cyclin D3. Total RNA was isolated from cells treated with or without TNF using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentrations were determined using a spectrophotometer. RPA was then performed using the RPA kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a labeled RNA probe was synthesized by T1 RNA polymerase in the presence of RPA template and [α-32P]UTP. The RPA template contains the cDNAs encoding cylin B, cyclin C, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, L32, and GAPDH, respectively. The labeled probe was then mixed with the sample RNA at 56 °C for 14 h followed by at 37 °C for 15 min. After hybridization, RNase A was added and incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. After RNase digestion was completed, the samples (target RNAs) were separated on a polyacrylamide gel, and protected mRNAs were visualized by autoradiography. Quantities of proteins detected by invitro kinase assay, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation were quantitated by image reading, using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The numbers produced were proportional to the degree of protein expression. Percent decreases or increases in protein levels were then calculated. Cell cycle data were expressed as the mean from two to four separate experiments. The statistical significance of differences between group means or protein quantities was determined using the Student's t test. When studying the apoptotic effect of TNF-α on TF-1 human erythroid leukemia cells, we observed that the cells also showed cell cycle arrest features. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that TNF induced a G1 arrest. In normal culture conditions, 43% of TF-1 cells in G1 and 44% of the cells in S phases. TNF, at a concentration of 30 ng/ml for 24 h, increased the proportion of G1 cells to 67% and decreased the proportion of S cells to 14%. Longer incubation time (48 h) of cells with TNF slightly increased G1 population and decreased S population (Fig. 1A). TNF-induced G1arrest is not limited to this particular cell line, since the same concentration of TNF also brought about significant G1arrest in MV4–11 cells. Approximately, 55% of cells were distributed in G1 and 41% of cells in S in control MV4–11 cells. Treatment of cells with TNF caused a marked increase of G1cells to 76% and a decrease of S cells to 11% by 24 h. Since the phosphorylation status of pRb (the retinoblastoma gene product) and the expression of “cdk inhibitor” p27 have been linked to cell cycle status, we next investigated whether TNF-induced G1 arrest accompanied with an alteration in pRb phosphorylation or p27 expression. In exponentially growing phase, TF-1 and MV4–11 cells (0 time) expressed both underphosphorylated (bottom band) and phosphorylated pRb (top band) proteins at a molecular size of ∼110 kDa. By 24 and 48 h after addition of TNF to the cells, the phosphorylated pRb (slowest moving form, top band) was decreased by 70–80% in both TF-1 and MV4–11 cells (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether the decrease in pRb is related to phosphorylation of pRb, a specific antibody against phosphorylated pRb (Ser-795) was used for further blotting experiments. As shown in Fig. 1 B, phosphorylated pRb is expressed in exponentially growing TF-1 and MV4–11 cells (0 h) as a single band in SDS-PAGE and was dramatically decreased within 24–48 h after initiating TNF treatment. TNF-induced dephosphorylation of pRb is similar to the effect of TGFβ on pRb in these cells. TNF also caused a marked accumulation of p27. In the absence of TNF, both TF-1 and MV4–11 cells expressed relatively small amounts of p27, addition of TNF led to a marked increase of p27, with ∼20-fold (in MV4–11) and 35-fold (in TF-1) increase of p27 being observed by 48 h, as measured by image reading, using ImageQuant (Fig. 1 B). Since synthesis of D-type cyclins and phosphorylation of pRb are at approximately the same time in G1 and since D-type cyclins play a critical role in G1 progression and G1-S transition (21.Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 22.Xiong Y. Connolly T. Futcher B. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 65: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), we asked whether TNF affects the abundance of the D-type cyclins and their catalytic subunits. Thus, the expression of D-type cyclins, cdk2, cdk4, and cdk6 was examined by Western blotting before and after TNF treatment. Proliferating TF-1 cells not exposed to TNF expressed cyclin D2, cyclin D3, cdk2, cdk4, and cdk6 at ∼33–35 kDa, and addition of TNF caused a considerable decrease of cyclins D2 and D3, with 65 and 70% decrease being detected by 48 h, respectively. Compared with the expression of cyclins D2 and D3, TF-1 cells expressed relatively low levels of cyclin D1 and addition of TNF for 24 or 48 h suppressed cyclin D1 to a lesser extent (42%) than cyclins D2 and D3 (Fig. 2 A). Incubation with TNF for less than 12 h had no significant effect on the expression of these cyclins. We confirmed that there was equivalent loading of total proteins, because cells treated with or without TNF expressed the same levels of actin (negative control). In addition, there were no detectable alterations in the expression of cdk2, cdk4, or cdk6 at any time point up to 48 h after initiating TNF treatment. TNF similarly suppressed the expression of cyclins D2 and D3 in MV4–11 cells. However, cyclin D1 was barely detected in this cell line (data not shown). The effect of TNF on the expression of D-type cyclins is dose- and time-dependent with a maximal inhibition of cyclin D3 being detected by 48 h and at a concentration range of 20–40 ng/ml TNF (data not shown). Next, we investigated D-type cyclin-dependent kinase activities, using in vitro kinase assays. Since the expression of cyclin D1 was very low in these two cell lines, we focused on the cyclin D2 and cyclin D3. TF-1 cells grown in the absence or presence of TNF (30 ng/ml) for 48 h were collected and lysed. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies against cyclins D2, D3, or IgG. The immunoprecipitates were then incubated with GST-Rb fusion protein in the presence of [γ-32P] ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression of phosphorylated GST-Rb was detected by autoradiography. High levels of cyclins D2- and D3-dependent kinase activities were observed in TF-1 cells in the absence of TNF. In contrast, cells treated with TNF for 48 h showed very low cyclin D2- and D3-dependent kinase activities, based on the expression of phosphorylated GST-Rb, with decreases of 55 and 87% of being observed, respectively. As negative controls, IgG immunoprecipitates either from proliferating TF-1 cells or from the cells treated with TNF lacked kinase activity (Fig. 2 B). Since D-type cyclins are mainly associated with cdk4, and the cyclin-cdk complexes play a critical role in G1 progression, we also examined cdk4 kinase activity. As expected, exposure to TNF for 48 h caused a dramatic decrease of cdk4 kinase activity with ∼90% decrease being detected. Cyclin-cdk4 complexes are assumed to modify pRb, thereby promoting cell cycle progression toward DNA replication. By using a combination of immunoprecipitation and Western blot, we detected that association of D-type cyclins with pRb was significantly decreased in the cells treated with TNF for 48 h due to a decrease of total D-type cyclins (data not shown). Hypodiploid DNA (see sub-G1population) was observed in both TF-1 and MV4–11 cells treated with TNF (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that TNF caused apoptotic cell death in these cells, which is consistent with previous observations (23.Hu X. Tang M. Fisher A.B. Olashaw N. Zuckerman K.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3106-3115PubMed Google Scholar). One might expect that the G1 arrest could result from apoptosis. To study the association between G1 arrest and apoptosis, we measured caspase-3 activation and D-type cyclin expression before and after TNF treatment in the absence and presence of a caspase-3 inhibitor. It has been reported that caspase-3 is a key protease that becomes activated during TNF-induced apoptosis. Activated caspase-3 consists of multiple subunits, including 19 kDa, 17 kDa, and possible other smaller subunits, depending on the activity of caspase 3 and the cell type. TF-1 cells in the absence of TNF expressed 32-kDa proenzyme and barely activated caspase 3. However, a 24-h incubation with TNF caused a significant expression of activated caspase 3 (Fig. 3 A), evidenced by appearance of 19-, 17-, and 14-kDa proteins, detected by using both anti-caspase (top panel) and anti-specific activated caspase 3 (thesecond panel from top) antibodies. The specificity of caspase 3 activation was confirmed by using caspase inhibitor, zVAD-FMK, since the inhibitor at a concentration of 100 μm completely inhibited TNF-induced activation of caspase 3. In contrast, the inhibitor was not able to block TNF-induced down-regulation of the D-type cyclins and G1 arrest at any dose up to 200 μm. However, zVAD-FMK partially reduced the TNF-induced sub-G1 population (Fig. 3, A andB). To further ensure that the inhibition of D-type cyclins was not secondary to TNF-induced apoptosis, we analyzed patterns of cyclin D3 inhibition and cell death. The inhibition of cyclin D3 was dose-dependent with a maximal inhibition of 85% being detected at a concentration of 30 ng/ml TNF, above which the level of cyclin D3 was not further decreased. In contrast, the cell death caused by TNF increased lineally with increasing TNF concentration, with maximal cell death being observed at a concentration of 50 ng/ml TNF. In addition, TNF at a concentration of 10 ng/ml induced activation of caspase 3 but not inhibition of D-type cyclins (Fig. 3 C). These results demonstrated that TNFα-induced G1 arrest is caspase 3 pathway-independent. The TNF-induced down-regulation of D-type cyclins could be potentially regulated at mRNA or proteins levels. To test the first possibility, RPA were performed. As illustrated in Fig. 4 A, cells expressed cyclin D3, cyclin D2, and little cyclin D1 mRNAs. Addition of TNF (30 ng/ml) had no effect on the levels of mRNA encoding cyclins D1 and D2, but caused modest reduction in the levels of mRNA for cyclin D3 with a decrease of 22% being detected by 48 h measured using ImageQuant software. Control and TNF-treated cells showed the same levels of mRNAs for housekeeping genes, L32 and GAPDH, which were used as controls and references for normalizing samples. Unexpected, TNFα dramatically down-regulated the expression of mRNA for cyclin B, which is involved primarily in regulation of the G2-M transition of the cell cycles. Thus, the specific inhibitory effects of TNF on G1 regulatory molecules appear to be mainly at post-transcriptional levels. Two possibilities may account for the down-regulation of D-type cyclins at post-transcriptional levels: 1) TNF induces a decrease of biosynthesis rate of D-type cyclins; or 2) TNF causes a degradation of D-type cyclins. To clarify this question, MV4–11 cells were treated with or without TNF for 24 and 48 h, after which cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h and the expression of cyclins D2 and D3 were detected by autoradiography. As showed in Fig. 4 B, control cells (TNF−) expressed labeled cyclins D2 and D3, representing new synthesis of these cyclins. Addition of TNF for 24 h caused ∼50% decreases in the quantities of cyclins D2 and D3. However, further increase of incubation time (48 h) with TNF did not further down-regulate the levels of cyclins D2 and D3, suggesting that TNF induced down-regulation of D-type cyclins is most likely not related to biosynthesis rate. However, if cells were chased for different times with normal culture medium containing unlabeled methionine after they released from medium containing [35S]methionine, we observed a chase time-dependent reduction in the amounts of labeled cyclins D2 and D3 in the cells treated with TNF, with maximal reductions of 65 to 70% being detected by 4 h (Fig. 4,B and C). In contrast, the expression of cyclin E was not affected by TNF treatment. Thus, TNF-induced down-regulation of D-type cyclins appears to be a result of degradation. This was confirmed by the approach of using degradation inhibitors. Since degradation of IκBα by TNF has been well established, we wondered if degradation of IκBα was linked to D-type cyclin expression. To clarify this question, the expression of IκBα and D-type cyclins in the absence and presence of TNF and several protein degradation inhibitors was examined by Western blotting.

https://openalex.org/W2043485602,"Despite very similar tertiary structures based upon a common framework, legume lectins exhibit an amazing variety of sugar binding specificities. While most of these lectins recognize rather discrete sugar linkages, Phaseolus vulgariserythroagglutinating and leukoagglutinating lectins (E4- and L4-PHA) are unique in recognizing larger structures. E4- and L4-PHA are known to recognize complex type N-glycans containing bisecting GlcNAc or a β1,6-linked branch, respectively. However, the detailed mechanisms of molecular recognition are poorly understood. In order to dissect the contributions of different portions of each lectin, we carried out region-swapping mutagenesis between E4- and L4-PHA. We prepared six chimeric lectins by exchanging different combinations of loop B and the central portion of loop C, two of four loops thought to be important for the recognition of monosaccharides (Sharma, V., and Surolia, A. (1997) J. Mol. Biol. 267, 433–445). The chimeric lectins' sugar binding activities were evaluated quantitatively by surface plasmon resonance. These comparisons indicate that the high specificities of E4- and L4-PHA toward bisecting GlcNAc and β1,6-linked branch structures are almost solely attributable to loop B. The contribution of the central portion of loop C to the recognition of those structural motifs was found to be negligible. Instead, it modulates affinity toward LacNAc residues present at the nonreducing terminus. Moreover, some of the chimeric lectins prepared in this study showed even higher specificities/affinities than native E4- and L4-PHA toward complex sugar chains containing either a bisecting GlcNAc residue or a β1,6-linked branch.

The legume lectins are a family of sugar-binding proteins found mainly in the seeds of plants belonging to theLeguminosae family (1.Sharon N. Lis H. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 2.Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys.

Lectins from leguminous plants constitute a large family of homologous proteins displaying remarkable divergence in their carbohydrate specificity. Elucidation of the mechanism by which these lectins can possess such a broad range of binding specificities while maintaining a strikingly similar three-dimensional monomer structure will be key to understanding the essence of carbohydrate-protein interactions. At present, the crystal structures of ∼20 legume lectins have been solved. 1The 3D Lectin Data Bank is available on the World Wide Web at webenligne.cermav.cnrs.fr/databank/lectine/. These various lectin monomers share a common so-called “jellyroll” structure composed primary of a six- and a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. Each monomer binds a manganese and a calcium ion that are both essential for carbohydrate binding. Amino acid sequence comparisons, x-ray crystallographic analysis, and mutagenesis studies revealed that the differences in carbohydrate specificity appear to be due primarily to differences in amino acid residues residing in loops adjacent to the carbohydrate binding site. The primary carbohydrate-binding site of legume lectins is a shallow depression on loops associated with the concave face of the seven-stranded curved β-sheet (5.Young N.M. Oomen R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is constructed mainly by residues from four sequentially separate regions, which are described by Sharma and Surolia (6.Sharma V. Surolia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) as loops A, B, C, and D. Side chains of two highly conserved residues, Asp and Asn (contributed by loops A and C, respectively), together with the backbone chain NH of a Gly or Arg residue from loop B, play crucial roles in carbohydrate recognition, since they participate in four key hydrogen bonds with the monosaccharide. The carbohydrate is further stabilized by stacking interactions with hydrophobic residues present in loop C. Gross differences in the size of loop D were shown to be crucial for distinguishing between Man/Glc and Gal/GalNAc (6.Sharma V. Surolia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although legume lectins have been subdivided into categories based on their monosaccharide specificities (1.Sharon N. Lis H. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 7.Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins: Properties, Functions and Applications in Biology and Medicine. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 33-247Crossref Google Scholar), there are marked differences in the fine specificities of the lectins within a single category. Despite clear delineation of the primary binding site, the mechanism by which legume lectins expand fine specificities and improve binding affinity by subsite multivalence (8.Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) is largely unknown.

Despite differences in binding specificities and hemagglutinating properties, subunits from E4- and L4-PHA are similar in molecular weight as well as carbohydrate and amino acid compositions. E4- and L4-PHA exhibit greatest affinity toward complex typeN-glycans containing either bisecting GlcNAc or β1,6-linked LacNAc, respectively (10.Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

The rather narrow differences between these two lectins make them well suited for the elucidation of subsite multivalence. Mirkov and Chrispeels (15.Mirkov T.E. Chrispeels M.J. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported that mutation of Asn128 to Asp in loop C of L4-PHA eliminates carbohydrate binding and biological activity, suggesting that this residue plays a key role in primary recognition. However, the mechanism of L4-PHA specificity toward β1,6-linked branch structures is not known. Although the three-dimensional structure of L4-PHA has been recently solved (16.Dao-Thi M.H.

To be concrete, the primary sequences of E4- and L4-PHA were compared, and loop B and the central portion of loop C were chosen for swapping, since the biggest differences among the four loops (A–D) were concentrated in these two. Sugar binding specificities of six prepared chimeric lectins were extensively analyzed using a quantitative assay system based on immobilized oligosaccharides. This study clearly suggested that each loop functions to recognize different parts of an oligosaccharide, and the combination of these loops determines both the specificities and affinities of sugar binding. Fetuin (insolubilized on 4% beaded agarose) was purchased from Sigma. BIACORE®(BIACORE AB, Uppsala, Sweden), which are based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR), were used to measure the biomolecular interactions. E4- and L4-PHA were purchased from Honen Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). The abbreviations and structures of the oligosaccharides used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. All of the oligosaccharides, except for NA4-HD, shown in Fig. 1, were purchased from Oxford GlycoSystems (Abingdon, UK). The BIACORE SensorChip SA, Surfactant P20 was obtained from BIACORE AB. The HBS buffer comprised 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.05% Surfactant P20 in distilled water. Lectins were purified by Superdex® 200, PC3.2/30 (Amersham Biosciences) using the HBS buffer as a solvent. Quantitation of the lectin was carried out with ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm monitored by a SMART® (Amersham Biosciences) UV monitor. 4-(Biotinamido) phenylacetylhydrazide (BPH) was synthesized as previously reported (18.Shinohara Y. Sota H. Gotoh M. Hasebe M. Tosu M. Nakao J. Hasegawa Y. Shiga M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 2573-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from midmaturation cotyledons (0.7 g total weight, 7–10 mm in length) of P. vulgaris cv. Tendergreen, according to the procedure reported by Hoffman et al. (19.Hoffman L.M. Ma Y. Barker R.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7819-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), using the QuickPrep® Total RNA Extraction Kit (Amersham Biosciences). RNA quantitation was done by extinctional measurement of 260 nm. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA described previously, using the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham Biosciences). All PCRs used for cloning purposes were carried out with the proofreading enzyme KOD polymerase (Toyobo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. E4- and L4-PHA cDNAs were amplified from the first-strand cDNA via the PCR. For amplifying L4-PHA, we used the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CATGAATTCATCCATGGCTTCCTCCAAGTTCT-3′ and 5′-TGGAGTTTGGATCCTAGAGGATTTTGTTGAGGA-3′, and for E4-PHA, we used the primers 5′-CATGAATTCATCCATGGCTTCCTCCAACTTAC-3′ and 5′-GTGGAGATGGATCCTAGAGGATTTGGTTGAGGA-3′. After digestion withEcoRI, each PCR-generated fragment was inserted into theSmaI and EcoRI site of pBluescript II SK(+) (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). From these clones, gene sequences lacking the signal peptide regions (L4-PHA, amino acids 1–20; E4-PHA, amino acids 1–21) (20.Hoffman L.M. Donaldson D.D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers 5′- CTCACCCACGCAATCATGAGCAACGATATCTAC-3′ (L-forward), 5′-GGTCGACTCTAGAACTAGTGG-3′ (L-reverse, for L4-PHA), 5′-CTCACCCACGCAACCATGGCCAGCCAAACCTCC-3′ (E-forward), and 5′-GGTCGACTCTAGAACTAGTGG-3′ (E-reverse, for E4-PHA). The two PCR-generated fragments were each cloned separately into theSmaI site of pUC18 using the SureClone™Ligation Kit (Amersham Biosciences). E4-PHA and L4-PHA were compared along their length with respect to hydrophobicity using Grease software based on the algorithms of Kyte and Doolittle (21.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) and Pearson and Lipman (22.Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). The E4- and L4-PHA genes each contain two EcoO109I sites flanking the region encoding the divergent B loop along with most of the divergent C loop. To facilitate use of these sites for domain swapping, the genes lacking signal peptides were subcloned via SalI and EcoRI from their pUC18 constructs into a pBluescript II SK(+) derivative from which the unique EcoO109I site had been removed. Following restriction digestion, the EcoO109I fragments were exchanged to create E-bLcL and L-bEcE. In order to construct chimeric genes encoding independent variation in loop B and loop C, overlap extension PCR was used for site-directed mutagenesis of the short segment encoding the two variant amino acids (VH or KD) at the center of loop C. In detail, overlapping NH2- and COOH-terminal encoding halves of each construct were amplified using appropriate outer primers (L-forward and L-reverse or E-forward and E-reverse) together with mutagenic overlapping inner primers, and the two amplified halves were combined in the overlap extension step. The overlapping primers for converting PHAE residues to PHAL residues were 5′-TGGGGTCCCAGTCCTTGTTGTAGAGGGTGTC-3′ (L-BND-RV) and 5′-GACACCCTCTACAACAAGGACTGGGACCCCA-3′ (L-BND-FW), while the opposite conversion was accomplished with the overlapping primers 5′-TGGGGTCCCAGTGAACGTTGTAGAGGGTGTC-3′ (E-BND-RV) and 5′-GACACCCTCTACAACGTTCACTGGGACCCCA-3′ (E-BND-FW). In this way, E-cL and L-cE were derived from E4-PHA and L4-PHA, respectively, and E-bL and L-bE were similarly derived from E-bLcL and L-bEcE. Using the BamHI and NcoI sites present in the outer forward and reverse primers, all eight PHA gene sequence variants (including wild types) were introduced individually into pET-11d (Stratagene) for expression. The constructed plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) grown on an LB plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The BL21(DE3) cells containing the plasmids were grown to the midlog phase at 37 °C in LB medium with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and then induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside to 1 mm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × gfor 10 min. Extracts of expressed cells were obtained by sonicating cells in phosphate-buffered saline and collecting the supernatant after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The collected supernatant was applied to a fetuin-agarose (Sigma) column, which had been equilibrated with 7.5 volumes of HBS buffer at 4 °C. After washing the column with HBS buffer, protein was eluted with 50 mmH3PO4, followed by desalting using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was concentrated by lyophilization and purified by Superdex 200, PC3.2/30 (Amersham Biosciences) using HBS as the running buffer. BPH tagging of oligosaccharides was performed under the previously reported conditions (18.Shinohara Y. Sota H. Gotoh M. Hasebe M. Tosu M. Nakao J. Hasegawa Y. Shiga M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 2573-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, the oligosaccharide dissolved in water was incubated with a 4-fold molar excess of BPH in 30% acetonitrile at 90 °C for 1 h. After the reaction, 50 mm formate buffer (pH 3.5) was added and stored at 4 °C for 12 h to promote tautomerization from the acyclic Schiff base type hydrazone to stable β-glycosides. The reaction mixture was injected directly into reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography to purify the BPH adducts. Oligosaccharide binding activities of E4-PHA, L4-PHA, and PHA mutants were measured by SPR using a BIACORE instrument. In this system, a BPH-labeled oligosaccharide (10 pmol) was introduced onto a streptavidin sensor surface (SensorChip SA; BIACORE AB, Tokyo, Japan). Lectins (10 μg/ml in HBS) were introduced onto the surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The interaction between lectin and oligosaccharide was monitored as the change in SPR response at 25 °C. After 3 min, flow was switched from sample to HBS buffer in order to initiate dissociation. Sensor surfaces were regenerated with 50 mmH3PO4. The apparent k d was analyzed by fitting the dissociation phase directly to the following equation,Rt=R0 exp(−kdt)Equation 1 using nonlinear least squares analysis (23.O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 24.Karlsson R. Roos H. Fagerstam L. Persson B. Methods. 1994; 6: 99-110Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar).R 0 represents the amplitude of the dissociation process. The k a was then analyzed by fitting the association phase directly to the following equation,Rt=CkaRmax/(Cka+kd)[1−exp{−(Cka+kd)t}]Equation 2 where R max represents the maximum lectin-oligosaccharide complex concentration (in resonance units), and C is the constant concentration of injected lectin. The area under the curve (AUC) for both association and dissociation phases was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. AUCd was extrapolated over an infinite time interval using nonlinear regression.AUC=∫t=t1t=t2RtdtSubstituting Equation 1 into Equation 3, and integration fromt 0, when dissociation was initiated, to ∞ gives Equation 4,AUCd0→∞=R0/kdEquation 4 Substituting Equation 2 into Equation 3 and integration from 0 to t 0 gives the following.AUCa=(CkaRmaxt0−R0)/(Cka+kd).Equation 5 The program package SYBYL® version 6.7 (Tripos Inc.) was used for all modeling. All computations have been carried out in a Silicon Graphics OCTANE™ work station provided with two 195-MHz R10000 processors. The molecules to be docked were first built with the correct chirality using the builder module in SYBYL and then minimized (500 cycles) using the MMFF94s force field (25.Mastryukov V.S. Chen K. Yang L.R. Allinger N.L. Theochem. 1993; 99: 199-204Google Scholar). All docking simulations were carried out with the program FlexX™ (26.Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar), which is part of the SYBYL package. FlexX uses a fast docking method that allows flexibility in the ligands, keeping the receptor fixed. It places ligands into the active site starting with one fragment and consequently building the whole molecule into the binding site, fragment by fragment. FlexX uses formal charges, which were turned on during the docking simulations. All of the relevant receptor information necessary for the docking simulations is stored in the receptor definition file (rd file or rdf). The protein structure used was the 2.8-Å resolution structure of phytohemagglutinin-L (17.Hamelryck T.W. Dao-Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Chrispeels M.J. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20479-20485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with accession code 1FAT in the Protein Data Bank. The coordinates of chain B were used, since this chain was not broken. Defaults have been used when creating the rd file and no special customizations have been done. The residues belonging to the binding site file in the rd file are Gln-19, Arg-20, Gly-44, Leu-46, Arg-48, Gly-83, Pro-84, Ala-85, Asp-86, Pro-94, Gly-96, Ser-97, Gln-98, Pro-99, Lys-100, Asp-101, Lys-102, Gly-103, Gly-104, Phe-105, Leu-106, Gly-107, Phe-109, Asp-110, Gly-111, Ser-112, Asn-113, Ser-114, Asn-115, Phe-116, His-117, Leu-126, Tyr-127, Asn-128, Lys-129, Asp-130, Trp-131, Asp-132, Asn-143, Ser-144, Ile-145, Arg-146, Thr-210, Thr-211, Gly-212, Ile-213, Asn-214, Lys-215, Gly-216, Asn-217, and Val-218. These residues were chosen because they surround the binding site formed between and around loops B and C. Five oligosaccharides (NGA2, NA2, NA2B, NA3, and NA4) were chosen as model oligosaccharides based on the known sugar binding specificities of E4- and L4-PHA. These were biotinylated with BPH and then immobilized onto streptavidin-coated sensor surfaces. The molar amount of each immobilized oligosaccharide is presumed to be nearly constant, since the amount of streptavidin was constant, and an excess of purified BPH-oligosaccharide was introduced (18.Shinohara Y. Sota H. Gotoh M. Hasebe M. Tosu M. Nakao J. Hasegawa Y. Shiga M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 2573-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A solution containing the lectin was passed over the sensor surface, and binding was monitored as changes in the SPR signal. The sensorgrams obtained for native E4- and L4-PHA with these model oligosaccharides are shown in Fig. 2. E4-PHA exhibited the greatest increases in resonance signal with NA2, NA2B, and NA3, and the maximum response with each was nearly equal although the patterns for the association and dissociation phases differed quite markedly. E4-PHA also interacted with NGA2 and NA4, displaying smaller increases in resonance signals. The apparent rate constant values were calculated for NA2, NA2B, and NA3 by fitting their sensorgrams using a simple one-to-one interaction model, and these are summarized in Table I. The differences in apparent k a were rather small, whereas the apparentk d differed by up to an order of magnitude. The other sensorgrams were difficult to fit to this model. In order to obtain quantitative values for comparison among all the sensorgrams, the AUCs for both the association and dissociation phases were calculated (see details under “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 3 a, the calculated AUCd0→∞ was extremely high for NA2B, and the other values in descending order were NA3 > NA2 > NGA2 ≥ NA4. This is a reasonable order in view of the previously reported sugar binding specificity of immobilized E4-PHA during affinity chromatography (12.Green E.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol.

The peak resonance signals obtained in descending order were NA2 > NA4 > NGA2 > NA2B ≈ NA3. Patterns for association and dissociation phases again varied dramatically. As shown in Fig. 3 b, the calculated AUCd0→∞ was extremely high for NA4 and decreased for the remaining four oligosaccharides in the order NA2 > NA3 > NGA2 ≥ NA2B. This also agreed well with the order previously reported for elution from immobilized L4-PHA during analytical affinity chromatography (10.Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11230-11234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Green E.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol.

J. 1988; 5: 85-97Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated the validity of this method as a quantitative procedure for comparing sugar binding specificities of chimeric lectins. The calculated AUCa showed no correlation with the results from affinity chromatography. The other main observation from this study is that the AUCd0→∞ values calculated for E4-PHA with the various oligosaccharides were generally higher than those for L4-PHA. The calculated AUCd0→∞ value of NA2B was 1,400-fold higher for E4-PHA than for L4-PHA. The only exception, NA4, exhibited a value 1.7-fold higher for L4- than for E4-PHA. The calculated AUCd0→∞values for the remaining oligosaccharides were uniformly higher with E4- than L4-PHA (by 70–270-fold). The oligosaccharide binding profiles confirmed that both native lectins can recognize fairly long sequences and that the lectins' binding specificities can differ considerably from each other. Whereas these differences must reflect differences in their structures, the three-dimensional structure of E4-PHA has yet to be solved, so no direct three-dimensional comparison can be made. Therefore, primary structures of four loops thought to play important roles in sugar recognition were compared (Fig. 4). The greatest differences resided in loop B; of 26 amino acid residues composing this loop in E4-PHA, five differed in identity, and two were absent altogether from L4-PHA. To date, the extent of knowledge about the role of loop B in legume lectins is that a Gly or Arg residue therein hydrogen-bonds with monosaccharides (6.Sharma V. Surolia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). How this longest loop contributes to fine sugar recognition is not known and therefore merits study. Moreover, two of four variant residues in loop C were also chosen. This loop contains calcium-binding sites and a strikingly important Asn residue, whose substitution to Asp eliminates sugar binding activity (15.Mirkov T.E. Chrispeels M.J. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29.van Eijsden R.R. Hoedemaeker F.J. Diaz C.L. Lugtenberg B.J. de Pater B.S. Kijne J.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These amino acid differences between E4- and L4-PHA were clearly reflected in a hydrophobicity scale comparison (Fig. 5). Averaged over an 11-residue window, E4-PHA is markedly less hydrophobic than L4-PHA in the C-terminal portion of loop B, whereas the opposite pattern exists for loop C. Due to the reasons described, we focused on those two loops, and six chimeric lectins were designed for the study of their sugar binding specificities.Figure 5Comparison of hydrophobicity profiles between E4- and L4-PHA. Hydrophobicity values were computed according to Kyte and Doolittle (21.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) usin"

Here we assessed the properties of an endogenous tg-insensitive nonmitochondrial Ca2+ store in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells, which express a mammalian homologue of Pmr1. The tg-insensitive Ca2+ store was considerably less leaky for Ca2+ than the sarco(endo)plasmic-reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA)-containing Ca2+ store. Moreover like for the worm Pmr1 Ca2+ pump expressed in COS-1 cells, Ca2+ accumulation into the endogenous tg-insensitive store showed a 2 orders of magnitude lower sensitivity to cyclopiazonic acid than the SERCA-mediated transport. 2,5-Di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone was only a very weak inhibitor of the tg-insensitive Ca2+ uptake in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells and in COS-1 cells overexpressing the worm Pmr1.

In the presence of tg, 15% of intact A7r5 cells responded to 10 μm arginine-vasopressin with a small rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration after a long latency. In conclusion, A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells express a Pmr1-containing Ca2+ store with properties that differ substantially from the SERCA-containing Ca2+ store.

The functional properties of this Golgi Ca2+ store and its contribution in generating intracellular Ca2+ signals remain, however, largely unknown, mainly because the Ca2+ uptake system of the Golgi complex is less well understood and partly because the volume of the Golgi apparatus appears to be considerably smaller than that of the ER.

In contrast, about half of the Ca2+ uptake in an isolated stacked Golgi fraction obtained from rat liver was reported to be insensitive to tg (10Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M.H.

The most important results of these studies were that Pmr1 largely co-localized with the Golgi apparatus and that the large tg-insensitive Ca2+ store observed in those cells was 33% responsive to IP3, albeit with a 3 times lower sensitivity than the tg-sensitive Ca2+ store (14Missiaen L. Van Acker K. Parys J.B., De Smedt H. Van Baelen K. Weidema A.F. Vanoevelen J. Raeymaekers L. Renders J. Callewaert G. Rizzuto R. Wuytack F. J. Biol.

The heterologous expression of a Pmr1 Ca2+ pump from a different species, however, did not allow us to draw conclusions about the significance of endogenous Ca2+ signaling by the Golgi compartment in normal cells. We therefore screened for the presence of a Ca2+ store with similar properties as the Pmr1-induced Ca2+ store in nontransfected cells. Here we report on the properties of such a store in rat aortic A7r5 smooth muscle cells and in 16HBE14o− human bronchial mucosal cells. A7r5, COS-1, and 16HBE14o− cells were cultured as described previously (7Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol.

For45Ca2+ fluxes cells were seeded in 12-well dishes (4 cm2; Costar, Cambridge, MA) at a density of ∼104 cells cm−2, and for Ca2+imaging experiments cells were seeded in Coverglass Chambers (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) at a density of 5 × 104 cells cm−2. Four days after plating, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with Pmr1 from C. elegans in a pMT2 vector (7Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and investigated 3 days later. A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells were investigated 7 and 5 days, respectively, after plating. The cells were permeabilized by treating them for 10 min with 20 μg ml−1 saponin at 25 °C in a medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm EGTA. The nonmitochondrial Ca2+ stores were loaded for 45 min in loading medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.44 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaN3, 10 μm oligomycin, 10 μm antimycin A, and 150 nm free Ca2+ (23 μCi ml−1). Tg (10 μm) was added to the loading medium if inhibition of the SERCA Ca2+ pumps was needed. Efflux was performed in a medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), and 1 mm EGTA. Free concentrations of Ca2+ were calculated by the Cabuf program (ftp://ftp.cc.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/droogmans/cabuf.zip) and based on the stability constants given by Fabiato and Fabiato (17Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment the 45Ca2+ remaining in the stores was released by incubation with 1 ml of a 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate solution for 30 min. Changes of the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i) were recorded in single indo-1-loaded cells at 25 °C using an MRC-1024 (Bio-Rad) system as described previously (14Missiaen L. Van Acker K. Parys J.B., De Smedt H. Van Baelen K. Weidema A.F. Vanoevelen J. Raeymaekers L. Renders J. Callewaert G. Rizzuto R. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39161-39170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cells were superperfused with 135 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 11.6 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 11.5 mm glucose, and 1.5 mm Ca2+. Some cells were pretreated for 1 h with 10 μm tg. The expression of Pmr1 in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells was verified at the mRNA level by RT-PCR on total RNA. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. 120 of this mixture was used for a 26-cycle PCR. The forward and reverse primers for the rat sequence were AAACTGGAACCCTGACGAAG (nucleotides 646–665 in GenBankTM accession no. M93018) and TTGGCTTTCCCATCAGAGTG (nucleotides 851–870), respectively. The annealing temperature was 53 °C. The forward and reverse primers for the human sequence were GGTGTGAAAGAAGCTGTTACAAC (nucleotides 1805–1827 in GenBankTM accession no. AF189723) and GTAAAATACTGCAACCTTTGG (nucleotides 1988–2008), respectively. The annealing temperature was 60 °C. In both cases, the forward and the reverse primers were located in different exons. All members of the SERCA family of Ca2+ pumps are irreversibly inhibited by tg with similar affinity (2Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We loaded the Ca2+ stores of permeabilized A7r5 (Fig.1 A) and 16HBE14o− cells (Fig.1 B) in the absence (open symbols and dotted line) or presence (closed symbols and full line) of a supramaximal concentration of tg (10 μm) and then investigated how the Ca2+ contents of the respective Ca2+ stores decreased as a function of time of incubation in efflux medium. A subcompartment of the Ca2+stores could still actively sequester Ca2+ despite the presence of high tg levels to block SERCA Ca2+ pumps. Of the total Ca2+ uptake in A7r5 cells, 92% involved a tg-sensitive SERCA Ca2+ pump (arrow bin Fig. 1 A), and 8% was mediated by a tg-insensitive Ca2+ uptake mechanism (arrow a in Fig. 1 A). The values were 89 and 11%, respectively, for the 16HBE14o− cells (Fig. 1 B). Mitochondrial Ca2+uptake was prevented by the presence of 10 mmNaN3, 10 μm oligomycin, and 10 μm antimycin A and could therefore not account for the tg-resistant fraction. After loading the stores to steady state, their passive permeability to Ca2+ was assessed by switching to an efflux medium containing 2 mm EGTA with no added Ca2+ or ATP. The Ca2+ efflux that occurred under these conditions can be considered as unidirectional since the calculated free [Ca2+] in the efflux medium (<10 nm) was below the threshold to stimulate the Ca2+ pumps, and no ATP was present to fuel the pumps. Fig.2 shows for A7r5 (Fig. 2 A) and 16HBE14o− cells (Fig. 2 B) the decrease in Ca2+content as a function of time for both the tg-insensitive compartment (closed circles, full line) and the SERCA-containing Ca2+ store (open circles,dotted line). It is clear that the rates of Ca2+loss from the tg-insensitive compartment in A7r5 cells and especially in 16HBE14o− cells were significantly smaller than those of the SERCA-containing Ca2+ store. These differences were not a consequence of the different initial Ca2+ content of the two stores since the initial level of store loading has no effect on the passive Ca2+ leak (18Missiaen L., De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Raeymaekers L. Droogmans G. Van Den Bosch L. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 2 are in agreement with our earlier report that also the Pmr1-induced Ca2+ store in COS-1 cells was less leaky as compared with the ER in these cells (see Fig. 2B in Ref. 14Missiaen L. Van Acker K. Parys J.B., De Smedt H. Van Baelen K. Weidema A.F. Vanoevelen J. Raeymaekers L. Renders J. Callewaert G. Rizzuto R. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39161-39170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pmr1 is a tg-insensitive Ca2+ pump present in the Golgi apparatus (7Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,13Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), making it a likely candidate for the Ca2+ uptake mechanism in the presence of tg. Fig. 3shows that Pmr1 could indeed be demonstrated in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells at the mRNA level. Another argument for the presence of Pmr1 is that the pharmacology of the Ca2+ uptake mechanism of the tg-insensitive Ca2+ store in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells and that of the overexpressed Pmr1 Ca2+ pump in COS-1 cells were similar as discussed in the following paragraphs. Ca2+ uptake by the tg-insensitive nonmitochondrial Ca2+ store was inhibited by the mycotoxin cyclopiazonic acid with an IC50 of 165 μm in A7r5 cells (Fig. 4 A, closed symbols and full line) and 337 μmin 16HBE14o− cells (Fig. 4 B, closed symbols andfull line). These values were 2 orders of magnitude higher than the IC50 value found to inhibit SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake in A7r5 cells (1.0 μm, open circles and dotted line in Fig. 4 A) and 16HBE14o− cells (1.6 μm, open circles anddotted line in Fig. 4 B). The inhibition curves for the tg-insensitive Ca2+ uptake were also steeper than those of SERCA. The IC50 values for SERCA inhibition were higher than the previously reported value of 10–20 nm (19Seidler N.W. Jona I. Vegh M. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17816-17823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably as a consequence of the presence of 5 mm ATP in the uptake medium since ATP protects the enzyme in a competitive manner against inhibition by cyclopiazonic acid (19Seidler N.W. Jona I. Vegh M. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17816-17823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 C shows how cyclopiazonic acid affected exogenous Pmr1 in COS-1 cells overexpressing this Ca2+ pump (7Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Missiaen L. Van Acker K. Parys J.B., De Smedt H. Van Baelen K. Weidema A.F. Vanoevelen J.

In this assay system, Pmr1-induced Ca2+ pumping could be specifically measured as the difference in Ca2+ uptake between Pmr1-overexpressing COS-1 cells and control cells in a medium containing 10 μm tg. The closed circles andfull line in Fig. 4 C illustrate that cyclopiazonic acid inhibited Pmr1 with an IC50 of 294 μm, while SERCA in these cells was half-maximally inhibited at 0.7 μm (Fig. 4 C, open circles and dotted line). Pmr1 was therefore 2 orders of magnitude less sensitive to cyclopiazonic acid than was SERCA. The inhibition curve for Pmr1 was also steeper than that of SERCA. It is evident that the values obtained for the exogenous Pmr1 Ca2+ pump in COS-1 cells are in excellent agreement with the values found for the endogenous tg-insensitive Ca2+pump in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells. 2,5-Di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone, another inhibitor of the SERCA Ca2+ pumps (20Moore G.A. McConkey D.J. Kass G.E. O'Brien P.J. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), was only a very weak inhibitor of the tg-insensitive nonmitochondrial Ca2+ store since even very high concentrations (1 mm) only induced a partial inhibition in A7r5 cells (closed circles andfull line in Fig.5 A), in 16HBE14o− cells (closed circles and full line in Fig.5 B), and of the overexpressed Pmr1 in COS-1 cells (closed circles and full line in Fig.5 C). The values obtained for the exogenous Pmr1 Ca2+ pump in COS-1 cells are therefore again in excellent agreement with the values found for the endogenous tg-insensitive Ca2+ pump in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells. In contrast, Ca2+ uptake mediated by SERCA was inhibited with an IC50 of 1.4 μm in A7r5 cells, 1.3 μm in 16HBE14o− cells, and 1.0 μm in COS-1 cells (open circles and dotted line, respectively, in Fig. 5, A, B, andC). Permeabilized A7r5 cells were loaded to steady state with Ca2+ in the presence of 10 μm tg and a mixture of mitochondrial inhibitors and then incubated in efflux medium and stimulated with 100 μm IP3 (Fig.6 A, circles andfull line) or 10 μmA23187 as Ca2+ionophore (Fig. 6 A, squares and dashed line). IP3 induced a partial Ca2+ release from this compartment. Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (100 μm), cyclic ADP-ribose (100 μm), and caffeine (20 mm) all failed to release Ca2+under these conditions (data not shown). Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (100 μm), which has been reported to release Ca2+ from a tg-insensitive nonmitochondrial Ca2+ store in other cell types (21Galione A. Patel S. Churchill G.C. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and which was also reported to release Ca2+ in A7r5 cells (22Yusufi A.N.K. Cheng J. Thompson M.A. Chini E.N. Grande J.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), also was unable to release Ca2+ under these conditions (data not shown). In 16HBE14o− cells, no significant release was observed upon addition of 100 μm IP3 (Fig. 6 B,circles and full line) or 100 μminositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, 100 μm cyclic ADP-ribose, 20 mm caffeine, and 100 μmnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (data not shown). To compare the properties of the IP3 receptors in the tg-insensitive Ca2+ store with those in the SERCA-containing Ca2+ store in A7r5 cells, both types of stores were loaded with 45Ca2+ and then challenged with IP3 in efflux medium. The open circles and dotted line in Fig.6 C illustrate the Ca2+ release from the SERCA-containing Ca2+ store as a function of the [IP3]. The closed circles and full line are the values for the tg-insensitive Ca2+ store. The EC50 was 1.2 μm IP3 for the SERCA-containing Ca2+ store (dotted arrow) and 5.2 μm IP3 for the tg-insensitive Ca2+ store (solid arrow). A maximal [IP3] released 83% of the ionophore-releasable Ca2+ from the SERCA-containing Ca2+ store but only released 11% from the tg-insensitive Ca2+ store. A similar incomplete Ca2+ release at the highest [IP3] and a higher EC50 for IP3were previously also observed for the Pmr1-induced Ca2+store in COS-1 cells (14Missiaen L. Van Acker K. Parys J.B., De Smedt H. Van Baelen K. Weidema A.F. Vanoevelen J. Raeymaekers L. Renders J. Callewaert G. Rizzuto R. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39161-39170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The addition of 10 μm arginine-vasopressin to control A7r5 cells produced an immediate [Ca2+] i rise (Fig.7 A). This immediate response was abolished when the cells were pretreated with 10 μmtg (Fig. 7 B). Under these conditions, a delayed abortive [Ca2+] i rise occurred in 15% of the cells. This finding indicates that the tg-insensitive Ca2+ store in some cells was large enough to be discharged by external stimulation of the cell. Interestingly the Ca2+spikes in Pmr1-overexpressing COS-1 cells often also occur after a long latency (14Missiaen L. Van Acker K. Parys J.B., De Smedt H. Van Baelen K. Weidema A.F. Vanoevelen J.

None of the 16HBE14o− cells responded to 100 μm ATP in the presence of tg. We demonstrated in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells a tg-insensitive Ca2+ store that was less leaky for Ca2+ than the ER. Based on our findings that (i) Pmr1 was present in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells and that (ii) the Ca2+uptake mechanism of the tg-insensitive Ca2+ store in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells and the overexpressed Pmr1 Ca2+ pump in COS-1 cells had the same sensitivity to cyclopiazonic acid and 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone, we propose that the Pmr1 Ca2+ pump was responsible for loading up the tg-insensitive Ca2+ store in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells. Since Pmr1 is expressed in the Golgi apparatus (11Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), this tg-insensitive Ca2+ store in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells probably corresponds to the Golgi complex. IP3 released 11% of the Ca2+ accumulated in this compartment in A7r5 cells with an EC50 that was 5 times higher than for the ER in these cells. This store could also be released in intact cells during agonist stimulation. Heterogeneous nonmitochondrial Ca2+ stores therefore exist in A7r5 and 16HBE14o− cells."

As with phosphorylation, protein ubiquitination can be reversed, through the action of ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UBPs). Here we have analyzed 15 UBP disruption mutants in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified one (ubp3Δ) that acts specifically in the pheromone response pathway. Upon pheromone stimulation, ubp3Δ mutants accumulate unconjugated polyubiquitin chains as well as polyubiquitinated forms of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase Ste7. The ubp3Δ mutants exhibit a potentiated response to pheromone, as measured by in vivo MAP kinase activity, transcriptional induction, and cell cycle arrest. Signaling is likewise enhanced upon direct activation of Ste4 (G protein β subunit) and Ste11 (Ste7 kinase) but not the downstream transcription factor Ste12.

In humans, such receptors can detect hormones, neurotransmitters, odors, taste, and light. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, G protein-coupled receptors (Ste2, Ste3) respond to pheromones that initiate haploid cell fusion, or mating (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Upon receptor stimulation, the G protein α subunit (Gpa1) binds to GTP and dissociates from the G protein βγ subunits (Ste4/Ste18). The Gβγ dimer can then propagate the mating signal through activation of effector proteins, including a protein kinase (Ste20), a kinase scaffolding protein (Ste5), and the Cdc42 GDP-GTP exchange factor (Cdc24). These effectors go on to activate a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase cascade composed of Ste11 (MAPK kinase kinase), which phosphorylates and activates a dual specificity kinase Ste7 (MAPK kinase), which in turn phosphorylates and activates Fus3 (MAPK). Known downstream targets of Fus3 in the mating pathway include Ste12, a transcription factor, and Far1, a component of the cell cycle machinery. Phosphorylation of Ste12 and Far1 leads to enhanced transcription of pheromone-inducible genes and arrest of the cell division cycle in the late G1 phase (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). A general property of signaling cascades is the ability to abrogate their responsiveness over time (2Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). In yeast, pheromone signaling is attenuated by degradation of the peptide ligand, hydrolysis of GTP by Gα, and dephosphorylation of target proteins (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Further desensitization is achieved through feedback regulatory mechanisms, including phosphorylation, internalization, and degradation of cell surface receptors (3Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 4Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J.

Another desensitization mechanism involves the expression, phosphorylation, and stabilization of the GTPase-accelerating protein Sst2 (6Garrison T.R. Zhang Y. Pausch M. Apanovitch D. Aebersold R.

These processes allow resumption of cell division after pheromone arrest, whether or not mating is successful. There is emerging evidence that pheromone signaling is regulated through ubiquitination and degradation of constituent proteins (3Hicke L. Riezman H.

Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination requires ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin and Lys side chains of the target protein (8Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2889) Google Scholar). Conjugated ubiquitin is itself ubiquitinated, resulting in the formation of polyubiquitin chains. These chains are then recognized by the 26 S proteasome, which degrades the substrate protein (9Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). In the case of some cell surface receptors (e.g. Ste2 and Ste3) ubiquitination can function as a signal for ligand-induced endocytosis. This situation is unusual, however, in that the receptors are largely monoubiquitinated instead of polyubiquitinated and are delivered to the vacuole instead of the proteasome (3Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 4Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J.

Protein ubiquitination is reversible (10Wilkinson K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Following proteolysis of the substrate, ubiquitin is removed from the resulting protein fragments and reused. Moreover, some proteins appear to undergo ubiquitination without being degraded or targeted to the proteasome. For instance, the IκBα protein kinase is regulated through a cycle of stimulus-dependent ubiquitination and deubiquitination (11Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The immunoglobulin E receptor is ubiquitinated upon antigen binding but rapidly deubiquitinated upon antigen disengagement (12Paolini R. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In yeast, the ubiquitinated form of the transcription factor Met4 can associate with target promoters but fails to form functional transcription complexes, indicating that ubiquitination can directly regulate Met4 activity (13Kaiser P. Flick K. Wittenberg C. Reed S.I. Cell. 2000; 102: 303-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Whether or not the protein substrate is degraded, disassembly of polyubiquitin requires ubiquitin-C-terminal hydrolases and ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UBPs; also called isopeptidases and deubiquitinating enzymes) that cleave the amide bond between ubiquitin and the substrate protein (10Wilkinson K.D.

The UBP family is extremely divergent, in yeast ranging from 54 to 146 kDa; however, all members contain a signature sequence that includes conserved Cys and His residues needed for catalytic activity (16Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,17Larsen C.N. Price J.S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6735-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The cellular function of most UBPs is unknown (14Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Systematic disruption of the 16 UBP genes in yeast revealed only minimal phenotypic abnormalities, and none proved essential (18Li A.Y. Amerik S.J. Hochstrasser M. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 981-992PubMed Google Scholar). Where a ubp phenotype has been identified, there appears to be little functional overlap among family members (18Li A.Y. Amerik S.J. Hochstrasser M.

Cell. 1990; 61: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Doa4 is associated with the proteasome, where it removes ubiquitin from substrate intermediates during the course of proteolysis (19Papa F.R. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells lacking DOA4accumulate small polyubiquitinated peptide fragments, and the consequent depletion of free ubiquitin leads to stabilization of other substrates (19Papa F.R. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol.

Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another well characterized family member is Ubp14 (mammalian IsoT is similar), which appears to act downstream of Doa4 to disassemble free (unanchored) polyubiquitin chains (23Amerik A. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The large number of UBPs suggests that they may function in specific signaling or developmental pathways. Here, we demonstrate functional regulation of the G protein and MAP kinase signaling cascade by Ubp3 in yeast. These experiments reveal a novel mechanism of feedback regulation through pheromone-dependent ubiquitination of the MAP kinase kinase Ste7. Standard methods for the growth, maintenance, and transformation of yeast and bacteria and for the manipulation of DNA were used throughout (27Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). The yeast S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are BY4741 (MATaleu2Δ met15Δ ura3Δ), BY4741-derived mutants lacking STE4, STE7, UBP1,UBP2, UBP3, DOA4 (UBP4,SSV7, NPI2, ASI7), UBP5,UBP6, UBP7, UBP8, UBP9,UBP11, UBP12, UBP13, UBP14,UBP15, and UBP16 (LPF12) (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), MHY753 (MATahis3-Δ200 leu2Δ1 ura3-52lys2-801 trp1Δ63 ade2-101), MHY754 (MHY753, cim3-1), and MHY755 (MHY753, cim5-1) (28Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids used in this study that have been described previously are pRS316-GAL-STE4 (29Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and YCp50-STE11–4 (30Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) (from George Sprague, University of Oregon). Overexpression ofSTE12 was achieved by PCR amplification and subcloning into the pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (2 μm, URA3, GAL1promoter, CYC1 terminator) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). PCR primer was 5′-CCA GAA TGA AAG TCC AAA TAA CC-3′, 5′-TCA GGT TGC ATC TGG AAG G-3′ (for STE12). The pheromone-dependent growth inhibition (halo) and reporter-transcription assays were conducted as described previously (31Hoffman G. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ste4 and Ste7 and ubiquitination of Ste7 were monitored by immunoblotting of whole cell extracts. To monitor the loss of Ste7 over time, midlog cell cultures were treated with 2.5 μm α-factor for 30 min, followed by cycloheximide (10 μg/ml in 0.1% ethanol, final concentrations) for up to 90 min. Growth was stopped by the addition of 10 mm NaN3 and transfer to an ice bath. Cells were washed and resuspended directly in boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.0005% bromphenol blue) for 10 min, subjected to glass bead homogenization, and clarified by microcentrifugation. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was probed with antibodies to Ste4 at 1:2,000 (from Duane Jenness, University of Massachusetts), Pgk1 at 1:75,000 (from Jeremy Thorner, University of California, Berkeley, CA), ubiquitin at 1:100 (Sigma), or Ste7 at 1:200 (yN-18) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoreactive species were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce) of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) or anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Specificity of detection was established usingste4Δ and ste7Δ cell extracts as negative controls. For some experiments, ubiquitinated Ste7 was enriched by immunoprecipitation prior to immunoblotting. Cells were grown to midlog phase and either treated with 2.5 μm α factor or with water for 1 h. Approximately 100 ml of cells atA600 = 1 were harvested and lysed at 4 °C in 600 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 15 mm EGTA, 15 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmNaN3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) with the use of acid-washed glass beads and 30-s pulses of vortexing, repeated six times. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 6,500 ×g, and the resulting supernatant was removed and diluted to a final volume of 1 ml with wash buffer (the same as lysis buffer except without glycerol). Lysates were incubated with 40 μl of yN-18 goat anti-Ste7 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 90 min on ice. After clarification with 10-min high speed microcentrifugation at 4 °C, protein-antibody complexes were precipitated for 1 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated in wash buffer. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 30 s, and pellets were washed with wash buffer before final resuspension in 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. It is well established that the pheromone receptors are regulated by ubiquitination. Upon pheromone binding, Ste2 and Ste3 are rapidly phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, endocytosed, and degraded in the vacuole (3Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 4Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 5Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our goal here was to determine if postreceptor signaling events are similarly regulated by ubiquitination. Our initial approach was to examine the ubiquitination and signaling properties of strains lacking each of the known deubiquitinating enzymes. By removing UBPactivity from cells, we anticipated that short-lived changes in protein ubiquitination might be detected. This is analogous to using specific phosphatase inhibitors to preserve transient increases in protein phosphorylation. We initially investigated whether there are any global changes in ubiquitination following stimulation with pheromone. Extracts were prepared from wild type cells and from 15 different ubpdeletion mutants, either untreated or treated for 1 h with 2.5 μm α-factor. Whole cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and probed with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. All of the ubp mutants accumulated polyubiquitin chains of varying length and appeared depleted of free ubiquitin and smaller ubiquitin chains (four or fewer) as previously described fordoa4 and ubp14 (18Li A.Y. Amerik S.J. Hochstrasser M. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 981-992PubMed Google Scholar, 21Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Amerik A. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Following pheromone stimulation, the ubp3Δ mutant accumulated additional polyubiquitin chains. There was no effect of pheromone in wild type cells or in any of the other ubp mutants tested (Fig.1 and data not shown). We then examined whether UBP3 can modulate the pheromone response pathway. For these experiments, we compared signaling in wild type and each of the ubpΔ mutants using three standard bioassays. First, we measured pheromone-dependent growth arrest (31Hoffman G. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this assay, cells are spread onto solid medium and exposed to α-factor pheromone spotted onto sterile filter disks. The resulting zone of growth inhibition provides an indication of initial pheromone sensitivity (halo size) and long term desensitization (halo turbidity). Of the 15 ubp mutants tested, onlyubp3Δ exhibited a larger than normal zone of growth inhibition, indicating a ∼5-fold enhancement in pheromone sensitivity (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Second, we measured short term pheromone signaling using a reporter transcription assay, consisting of the pheromone-inducibleFUS1 promoter fused to the lacZ(β-galactosidase) reporter (31Hoffman G. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Compared with wild type cells, theubp3Δ mutant exhibited a 1.7-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity at the maximum effective dose and an elevated basal activity (i.e. no pheromone added) but no change in the EC50 (Fig. 2B). No difference was observed for the doa4Δ or ubp14Δ mutants. Finally, we measured pheromone-dependent MAP kinase activity using two endogenous substrates, the G protein β subunit (Ste4) and the MAP kinase kinase (Ste7). Feedback phosphorylation by the MAP kinases Fus3 (or Kss1, which has partially overlapping function) significantly reduces the electrophoretic mobility of each substrate and is conveniently monitored by immunoblotting with anti-Ste7 and anti-Ste4 antibodies (32Zhou Z. Gartner A. Cade R. Ammerer G. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 33Cole G.M. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 64: 703-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In either case, theubp3Δ mutation resulted in a substantial increase in basal and pheromone-stimulated phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). The extent of basal and pheromone-dependent phosphorylation was greater for Ste7 than Ste4. No difference was observed for either thedoa4Δ or ubp14Δ mutants. The data presented in Fig. 2 reveal that MAP kinase activity is elevated in UBP3-deficient cells. This is likely to be responsible for the increase in transcriptional activation and growth arrest exhibited in these mutants. The same immunoblots also revealed a very high molecular weight form of Ste7 in ubp3Δ cells treated with pheromone, a phenomenon commonly observed with proteins that have undergone polyubiquitination. Accumulation of the presumed ubiquitinated form of Ste7 is dose-dependent (Fig.3A). Ubiquitinated Ste7 is barely visible in the wild type cells even at the highest concentrations of α-factor sufficient to trigger growth arrest. Thus, accumulation of ubiquitinated Ste7 is dependent on pheromone and is not simply a result of cell division arrest. To confirm that Ste7 is ubiquitinated, the protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Ste7 antibodies and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. This enrichment scheme again yielded a high molecular weight band recognized by the ubiquitin antibodies (Fig. 3B). To confirm these results, we monitored expression of Ste7 in cim3–1 and cim5–1 mutant strains, which are deficient in 26 S proteasome activity (28Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Upon pheromone stimulation, expression of ubiquitinated and nonubiquitinated Ste7 increased in both mutants and in particular the cim3-1 strain (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that pheromone stimulation promotes the ubiquitination of Ste7. Ubiquitination typically leads to protein degradation. However, theubp3Δ mutant accumulates polyubiquitinated forms of Ste7, suggesting that Ste7 degradation is slowed in these cells. To test this possibility, we monitored Ste7 degradation in ubp3Δ mutant and wild type cells treated with pheromone. Cells in midlog phase were treated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis and analyzed by immunoblotting with Ste7 antibodies. In both strains, the overall level of the native (nonubiquitinated) Ste7 dropped rapidly when translation was blocked, but the ubp3Δ mutation extended the half-life of the native Ste7 by ∼90% (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that Ste7 is degraded rapidly and that degradation is accelerated by Ubp3 expression. The data above indicate that Ubp3 can modulate Ste7 ubiquitination, degradation, and pheromone responsiveness. We therefore examined whether the functional effects of the ubp3Δ mutation are due to changes in Ste7 or perhaps due to some other unidentified target. To this end, we compared signaling in wild type and in ubp3Δ cells, activated at points upstream (STE4, STE11) and downstream (STE12) of Ste7. Overexpression of STE4 leads to an increase in cellular Gβγ beyond that which can bind to Gα and as a consequence leads to constitutive signaling (34Nomoto S. Nakayama N. Arai K. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Cole G.M. Stone D.E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Whiteway M. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). TheSTE11-4 mutant encodes a constitutively active form of the kinase (30Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Overexpression of STE12 leads to elevated transcription of pheromone-induced genes (37Dolan J.W. Fields S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, the ubp3Δ mutant can potentiate signaling by STE4 (Fig. 4A) andSTE11-4 (Fig. 4B) over the full range of α-factor concentrations. In contrast, the ubp3Δ mutant does not alter the response seen with STE12 overexpression at high doses of pheromone (Fig. 4C) and actually diminishes transcription at lower doses. We surmised that the diminished basal transcription could be due to the accumulation of Fus3, since in the absence of a sustained signal Fus3 can block Ste12 activity. Indeed, either deletion or overexpression of FUS3 leads to diminished signaling. Only upon pheromone treatment does Ste7 phosphorylate and activate Fus3, leading to disinhibition (through dissociation) and activation (through phosphorylation) of Ste12 (38Farley F.W. Satterberg B. Goldsmith E.J. Elion E.A. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1425-1444PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Voora D. Baggott D.M. Martinez A.R. Thorner J.

In agreement with this model, Fus3 expression is elevated in the ubp3Δ mutant as compared with wild type, particularly in the absence of pheromone (Fig. 5). Taken together, these data suggest that Ubp3 modulates pheromone signaling through deubiquitination and destabilization of Ste7.Figure 5Fus3 expression is elevated in the ubp3Δ mutant. Whole cell extracts were prepared from wild type, ubp3Δ,ubp4/doa4Δ, and ubp14Δ mutant strains, either untreated (−) or treated with 2.5 μmα-factor (+) for 1 h. Samples were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and probed using anti-Fus3 polyclonal antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Many biological processes are regulated through the modification of existing proteins. Modification by ubiquitination typically leads to destruction of the substrate protein. With regard to cell signaling, most work has focused on ubiquitination of tyrosine kinase receptors, transcription factors, and components of the cell cycle machinery. More recently, attention has turned to ubiquitination of G protein-coupled receptors and their downstream targets (7Madura K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 41Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 42Shenoy S.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35238-35244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). There has also been growing interest in mechanisms of protein deubiquitination(10Wilkinson K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that ubiquitination of Ste7 is stimulated by pheromone and that deubiquitination of Ste7 specifically requires the Ubp3 enzyme. In the absence of Ubp3 activity, Ste7 expression is elevated, and this leads to elevated MAP kinase activity, transcription, and growth arrest. Ubp3 is one of three UBPs originally isolated based on their ability to cleave a ubiquitin-β-galactosidase fusion test protein (47Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aubp3Δ mutant has a slight growth defect but no detectable change in total cellular ubiquitin-specific processing protease activity. Ubp3 was later shown to copurify with Sir4 (48Moazed D. Johnson D. Cell. 1996; 86: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), a factor necessary for transcriptional silencing (49Rine J. Herskowitz I. Genetics. 1987; 116: 9-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion ofUBP3 results in a marked increase in silencing at telomeres and the HML mating type locus, suggesting that Ubp3 is an inhibitor of silencing (48Moazed D. Johnson D. Cell. 1996; 86: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Ubp3 function in this context is not known. Although HML silencing is needed to preserve mating type and mating efficiency, the ubp3Δ mutant does not confer a sterile phenotype (48Moazed D. Johnson D. Cell. 1996; 86: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Indeed, our findings indicate thatubp3Δ actually enhances pheromone-dependent transcription and growth arrest and does so through action upstream of the transcription factor Ste12. Perhaps the best characterized UBP is Doa4. Doa4 is physically associated with the proteasome (19Papa F.R. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and appears necessary for deubiquitination of polyubiquitin-substrate intermediates prior to their degradation. Doa4 might also function to rescue inappropriately ubiquitinated proteins from degradation. Mutants of doa4have reduced cellular levels of free ubiquitin but elevated levels of ubiquitinated peptides, evidently the remnants of proteins degraded by the proteasome (21Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Even when ubiquitin is restored to normal or strongly elevated levels, however, degradation of a test substrate (ubiquitin-β-galactosidase fusion) is diminished. These findings indicate that the doa4Δ mutant is also defective for a postubiquitination step in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (19Papa F.R. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Another well characterized UBP is Ubp14, the yeast counterpart of mammalian isopeptidase T (22Lindsey D.F. Amerik A. Deery W.J. Bishop J.D. Hochstrasser M. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29178-29187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Amerik A. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and Drosophila UbpA (22Lindsey D.F. Amerik A. Deery W.J. Bishop J.D. Hochstrasser M. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29178-29187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This enzyme acts primarily on unanchored ubiquitin chains generated as intermediates in substrate degradation (15Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). A ubp14Δ mutant exhibits a defect in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and an accumulation of unanchored polyubiquitin chains (23Amerik A. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); these chains are thought to inhibit proteolysis by competing with polyubiquitinated substrates on the 26 S proteasome (50Hadari T. Warms J.V. Rose I.A. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 719-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, Doa4 appears to remove ubiquitin chains from proteins already committed to degradation by the proteasome (25Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), while Ubp14 acts to disassemble free ubiquitin chains (23Amerik A. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Notably, neither mutant affects the pheromone response. Moreover, the defects that are associated withdoa4Δ and ubp14Δ appear not to be rescued by other UBP isoforms, even when present on high copy plasmids. Thus, it seems likely that each UBP shares a common catalytic activity but can have highly specific cell regulatory functions in vivo, perhaps acting on just a subset of ubiquitinated substrates. Individual UBPs could have specific roles in the reversal of regulatory ubiquitination (11Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), editing of inappropriately ubiquitinated proteins and regeneration of active ubiquitin from adducts with small cellular nucleophiles (such as glutathione) that may be produced by side reactions. Another possibility is that different UBPs recruit only selected substrates to the proteasome (Fig.6). This model would explain how Ste7 can be ubiquitinated but not degraded in ubp3Δ cells. A modest increase in Ste7 expression could well account for the enhanced signaling observed in the ubp3Δ mutant. Ste7 appears to be the limiting component of the MAP kinase cascade. Estimates from quantitative immunoblotting studies revealed the number of Ste7 molecules (∼2,000/cell) to be considerably lower than either Fus3 or Kss1 (∼5,000 each) (52Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, a small change in Ste7 expression could easily account for the increased activity of Fus3/Kss1 observed in vivo. Indeed, it was shown previously that modest overexpression of STE7 (using a CYC1promoter and a low copy CEN plasmid) yielded a 1.4-fold increase in pheromone-stimulated gene transcription (32Zhou Z. Gartner A. Cade R. Ammerer G. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). An intriguing question is whether the ubiquitinated Ste7 species retains kinase activity and how this activity might compare with that of the nonubiquitinated species. Ste7 is also required for invasive growth (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ubp3 might regulate that signaling pathway as well. However, examination of this possibility could be challenging because of the lack of satisfactory quantitative assays of invasive growth similar to those used for the mating pathway. A more general question is whether UBP control of MAP kinase activity could lead to altered cell differentiation or transformation. Specific deubiquitinating enzymes have been shown to regulate cellular growth in a number of other organisms. In Dictyostelium, UbpA-deficient cells grow and respond normally to starvation growth conditions but fail to continue development to the stage where pulses of cAMP trigger aggregation and fruiting body formation (22Lindsey D.F. Amerik A. Deery W.J. Bishop J.D. Hochstrasser M. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29178-29187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Another isoform, UbpB, was identified in a two-hybrid screen using MEKKα (MAPKKK) as bait (53Chung C.Y. Reddy T.B. Zhou K. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3564-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells deficient in either MEKKα or UBPB develop precociously and exhibit abnormal cell type patterning. Deletion of UBPB alone was shown to diminish MEKKα expression and was stated to increase the abundance of ubiquitinated MEKKα (53Chung C.Y. Reddy T.B. Zhou K. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3564-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the UBP fafdetermines cell growth and cell differentiation during eye development (54Huang Y. Baker R.T. Fischer-Vize J.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 55Huang Y. Fischer-Vize J.A. Development. 1996; 122: 3207-3216PubMed Google Scholar). Antagonizing ubiquitination by the neuronal overexpression offaf or yeast UBP2 leads to synaptic overgrowth and defects in neurotransmitter release. This phenotype is very similar to the loss-of-function phenotype of hiw, a putative synaptic E3 ubiquitin ligase (56DiAntonio A. Haghighi A.P. Portman S.L. Lee J.D. Amaranto A.M. Goodman C.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In mammals, the protooncogenetre-2 encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme, and thetre-2 oncoprotein exhibits transforming activity in 3T3 fibroblasts (25Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 57Nakamura T. Hillova J. Mariage-Samson R. Onno M. Huebner K. Cannizzaro L.A. Boghosian-Sell L. Croce C.M. Hill M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 733-741PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the deubiquitinating enzyme encoded byunp is tumorigenic in transgenic mice (58Gupta K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2307-2310PubMed Google Scholar, 59Gupta K. Chevrette M. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1729-1731PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known if any of these transforming mutations alter MAPKK ubiquitination or activity. In summary, we have demonstrated that Ste7 is regulated by ubiquitination and that Ste7 ubiquitination is regulated by pheromone and Ubp3. Our results imply that other Ubp isoforms will have highly selective cell-regulatory functions and that MAP kinase kinases in other organisms may be similarly regulated by growth factor stimulation.

We used cultured chick embryo ventricular myocytes as a model to study a potential physiological role of the P2X4 receptor in mediating the positive inotropic effect of ATP. The chick P2X4 receptor (cP2X4R) mRNA was expressed in the heart and the pharmacological features of the ATP-induced positive inotropic response were similar to those of the cP2X4R in terms of insensitivity to blockade by known P2 receptor antagonists and the ineffectiveness of adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate as an agonist. Treatment of myocytes with antisense oligonucleotides specific to the 5′ region of cP2X4R abrogated the P2 agonist-stimulated 45Ca influx. Similarly, antisense oligonucleotide treatment also blocked the 2-methylthio-ATP-stimulated increase in contractile amplitude. The data suggest that the native P2X4 receptor is involved in mediating the P2 agonist-stimulated response in the heart. In characterizing the biochemical property of the P2X4 receptor, antibody against cP2X4R detected a 44-kDa and a 58-kDa protein in the immunoblot. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin converted the 58-kDa protein to the 44-kDa protein, suggesting that the 58-kDa protein was a glycosylated P2X4receptor. The nonglycosylated 44-kDa P2X4 receptor was resistant to various detergent/aqueous extraction, consistent with a role of glycosylation in maintaining its detergent solubility and hydrophilicity. Cross-linking the cell surface proteins withN-hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin followed by affinity precipitation with streptavidin-conjugated agarose and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-cP2X4R showed that only the glycosylated 58-kDa P2X4 receptor was expressed on the cell surface, indicating an important role of glycosylation for the receptor’s localization on the plasma membrane. These data revealed a novel physiologic function of the P2X4 receptor and suggested the importance of N-linked glycosylation in its cell surface expression and detergent solubility.

Seven isoforms of P2X receptors identified so far show 35–50% sequence identities based on comparison of the homologous region. Each receptor has two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop that contains a number of putativeN-glycosylation sites and an ATP binding site. Recent human genome data suggested three additional possible P2X receptors in the human genome, and no P2X counterparts were found in the yeast orDrosophila genome (4Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Li E.W.

Wortman J.R. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10634) Google Scholar). Both N- and C-intracellular termini have been shown to be important in determining the rate of desensitization of the P2X receptor (1Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar, 2Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Stuhmer W. J. Membr.

Biochemical and elctrophysiological studies suggested homomeric and heteromeric structures, possibly trimer, as the functional form of P2X receptors (1Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that P2X receptors are involved in a wide range of functions in synaptic transmission and in excitation of smooth muscle and inflammatory cells (1Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar, 2Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Stuhmer W. J. Membr.

Various phenotypes were found in P2X-deficient mice, such as reduced fertility in P2X1R knockout male mice (8Mulryan K. Gitterman D.P. Lewis C.J. Vial C. Leckie B.J. Cobb A.L. Brown J.E. Conley E.C. Buell G. Pritchard C.A. Evans R.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and reduced sensitivity to pain in P2X3R knockout mice (9Souslova V. Cesare P. Ding Y. Akoplan A.N. Stanfa L. Suzuki R. Carpenter K. Dickenson A. Boyce S. Hill R. Nebenius-Oosthuizen D. Smith A.J.H. Kidd E.J. Wood J.N. Nature. 2000; 407: 1015-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, the physiological function of individual P2X receptors remains largely unknown. The P2X4 receptor was chosen for study of its physiological role for the following reasons. First, the pharmacological features of the native P2 receptor-mediated increase in cardiac myocyte contractility were most similar to those of the P2X4receptor. Thus, the P2 agonist 2-methylthio-ATP (2-meSATP)1 is an efficacious agonist at stimulating both the myocyte contractility and the P2X4 receptor-mediated current, whereas AMP-CPP is a weak agonist (18Xu E. Podrasky D. Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2380-H2387PubMed Google Scholar). Further, the increase in myocyte contractility was insensitive to blockade by the P2 antagonist suramin or pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid, as was the P2X4 receptor-mediated increase in current. Finally, the receptor was expressed in the heart, and its cardiac transgenic overexpression resulted in an increased basal contractility of the intact heart, mediated via the endogenous ATP stimulating the overexpressed P2X4 receptor (11Hu B. Mei Q. Smith E. Barry W.H. Liang B.T. FASEB J. 2001; 10: 2739-2741Google Scholar). Most membrane receptors are glycoproteins. The oligosacchrides are involved in various biological activities including intracellular trafficking, maintenance of receptor stability, recognition of ligand, and proper folding of the receptor. N-Linked glycosylation of the thrombin receptor in T lymphoid cells or of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in Ewing's sarcoma cells was shown to be important for localization of the receptor on plasma membrane (12Tordai A. Brass L.F. Gelfand E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Girnita L. Wang M. Xie Y. Nilsson G. Dricu A. Wejde J. Larsson O. Anticancer Drug Des. 2000; 15: 67-72PubMed Google Scholar). However, glycosylation of the human parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor was not important for their expression at the cell surface or for the integrity of their functional responsiveness (14Bisello A. Greenberg Z. Behar V. Rosenblatt M. Suva I.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15890-15895Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). N-Linked glycosylation of the rat P2X2 and P2X1 receptors was important for their cell surface expression (15Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14845-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Rettinger J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15177-15182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because the P2X4 receptor is a cell surface ligand-gated ion channel, studying the biochemical determinant of the receptor's localization on plasma membrane is highly relevant to its physiological function. Thus, another objective of the study was to test the possible glycosylation of P2X4receptor and to study the role of such glycosylation in the cell surface expression of the P2X4 receptor. Chick P2X4R full-length clone was isolated from a 17-day-old embryo brain cDNA library (custom made; Stratagene) using as a probe a partial cP2X4 sequence obtained by degenerate PCR on RNA isolated from cultured cardiac ventricular myocytes as previously described (10Ruppelt A. Liang B.T. Soto S. Prog. Brain Res. 1999; 120: 81-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector. The full-length cDNA was then subcloned in pcDNA3 expression vector as previously described (10Ruppelt A. Liang B.T. Soto S. Prog. Brain Res. 1999; 120: 81-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorothioated sense (CCGGCCGCCGCCATGGCT) and antisense (AGCCATGGCGGCGGCCGG) oligonucleotides overlapping the 5′-untranslated region and translation start region of chick P2X4 cDNA were synthesized by the Cell Center at the University of Pennsylvania (start code location underlined). Cardiac ventricular cells were cultured from chick embryos 14 days in ovoaccording to previously described procedures (18Xu E. Podrasky D. Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2380-H2387PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in cultures for 12 h before being exposed to the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitates for 6 h at 37 °C (19Xu H Miller J. Liang B.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6425-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After two washes with fresh growth medium, the myocytes were cultured for an additional 24 or 36 h as indicated under “Results.” For treatment with sense and antisense oligonucleotides, 1 μmsense or antisense oligonucleotides were included in calcium phosphate transfection mixtures. After 6 h, the medium was replaced with that containing the oligonucleotides for additional 2 days, at which time the effect on cell contraction and 45Ca uptake were measured. For inhibition of N-linked glycosylation, the cells transfected with the cP2X4R cDNA 12 h earlier were washed twice with fresh growth medium, and the cells were then maintained in the culture medium containing 1 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for an additional 24–36 h. Myocyte cultures were incubated with sense or antisense oligonucleotides as described above. The effect of 2-meSATP-stimulated 45Ca uptake was measured according to a previously described method (18Xu E. Podrasky D. Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2380-H2387PubMed Google Scholar). Chick P2X4antiserum was raised in rabbit against a peptide (KKYKYVEDYELGTSET) corresponding to the C terminus of chick P2X4 receptor (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA). Isolated cardiac cells were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 50 μg of solubilized proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, followed by probing with the rabbit polyclonal antibody. Following several washes, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit Ig antibody (1:5000) and developed with an ECL-Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). The same antibody incubated with its peptide antigen was used as a negative control. Poly(A)+ mRNAs were isolated from tissues obtained from 14-day-old chicken embryos using the FastTrack kit 2.0 (Invitrogen). Ten micrograms of mRNA per tissue were separated in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, capillary-transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and UV-cross-linked. The membrane was hybridized with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe containing the complete coding region of cP2X4. The hybridization was performed in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 1 h, and the final wash of the membrane was done in 0.1× SSC, 0.1× SDS at 50 °C. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 3 days. Chick cardiac cells were washed three times with serum-free culture medium, labeled byN-hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin (Pierce; 1 mg/ml in serum-free culture medium) for 20 min in the CO2incubator. The labeled cells were washed three times with the same medium and extracted by SDS extraction buffer (40 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1.3% SDS, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma). Myocyte extracts were diluted to 0.5% SDS by TET buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-114, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture), and the biotinylated cell surface proteins were precipitated by streptavidin-conjugated agarose (Pierce) in the same buffer. The precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed in Western blot by antiserum against chick P2X4 receptor (1:600 dilution). The physiological role of the recently identified ligand-gated P2X receptors is an area of much investigative interest. Whereas some P2X receptor-null mice suggested an important role of the P2X1receptor in male fertility and of the P2X3 receptor in coding the intensity of warm stimuli (8Mulryan K. Gitterman D.P. Lewis C.J. Vial C. Leckie B.J. Cobb A.L. Brown J.E. Conley E.C. Buell G. Pritchard C.A. Evans R.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 9Souslova V. Cesare P. Ding Y. Akoplan A.N. Stanfa L. Suzuki R. Carpenter K. Dickenson A. Boyce S. Hill R. Nebenius-Oosthuizen D. Smith A.J.H. Kidd E.J. Wood J.N. Nature. 2000; 407: 1015-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), the biological role of other P2X receptor subtypes remained unclear. In the present study, a physiological role of the P2X4receptor was investigated. Cultured chick cardiac cells were chosen as a model for the following reasons. First, the chick P2X4 receptor (cP2X4R) mRNA was expressed in the chick heart. Fig. 1showed that the cP2X4R transcript in the heart was expressed at the same or a higher level than in the brain, although lungs have the highest level among the three tissues. In fact, the chick P2X4 receptor cDNA was cloned based on degenerate PCR on RNA isolated from the cultured chick cardiac cell (10Ruppelt A. Liang B.T. Soto S. Prog. Brain Res. 1999; 120: 81-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, in addition to being expressed in the heart, the pharmacological features of chick P2X4R-mediated ionic current also appeared similar to those of the native P2 receptor that mediated the ATP-induced increase in myocyte contractility (10Ruppelt A. Liang B.T. Soto S. Prog. Brain Res. 1999; 120: 81-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Xu E. Podrasky D. Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2380-H2387PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, 2-meSATP was a more efficacious agonist than AMP-CPP at the cloned cP2X4 receptor and at stimulating the native chick P2 receptor-mediated increase in myocyte contractility (18Xu E. Podrasky D. Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2380-H2387PubMed Google Scholar). The P2 receptor antagonist suramin (50 μm) did not block the native P2 receptor-mediated increase in myocyte contractile amplitude by 2-meSATP. The percentage of stimulation above basal level in response to 2-meSTAP was 58 ± 15%, similar to the 53 ± 20% increase when suramin was also present (n = 8 cells from 4 cultures, p > 0.1 test) (Fig.2). Similarly, the P2 antagonist pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (50 μm) did not block the 2-meSATP-stimulated increase in myocyte contractility (data not shown). Although more work is needed, the pharmacological features of the P2 agonist-induced contractile response of the chick embryo cardiac myocyte are similar to those of the response in adult rat and mouse cardiac myocytes (11Hu B. Mei Q. Smith E. Barry W.H. Liang B.T. FASEB J. 2001; 10: 2739-2741Google Scholar, 18Xu E. Podrasky D. Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2380-H2387PubMed Google Scholar). Since the P2X4 receptor was also detected in these adult mammalian cardiac myocytes, the present data are consistent with the idea that the chick cardiac cell is a potentially good model to investigate the physiological role and biochemical property of the cardiac P2X4R.Figure 2P2 receptor agonist-stimulated increase in myocyte contractility is insensitive to blockade by receptor antagonist. Cardiac ventricular cells were cultured from chick embryos 14 days in ovo, and the myocyte contractile amplitude was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were exposed to a perfusion medium (4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose) that contained 2-meSATP (1 μm) in the presence or the absence of the P2 receptor antagonist suramin (50 μm). Measurement of contractile amplitude was carried out on only one cell per coverslip. Both the basal contractile amplitude and the amplitude measured during P2 agonist and antagonist exposure were determined. The representative tracing of eight cells from four cultures is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, the cultured chick cardiac cells were amenable to the gene or cDNA transduction approach, which complemented functional (such as calcium influx and contractility) and biochemical (such as cell surface receptor expression) studies. This is an important advantage because of the feasibility in comparing the biochemical and the functional data in the same cell model. To more definitively determine the function of the P2X4receptor in mediating the 2-meSATP-stimulated increase in myocyte contractility, antisense oligonucleotide directed at the 5′-untranslated region contiguous with the translation start site of the cP2X4R was prepared. The antisense oligonucleotide against the cP2X4R effectively blocked the expression of the exogenous cP2X4R when both the oligonucleotide and the cP2X4R cDNA were transduced into the myocyte (Fig.3a). The anti-cP2X4R antibody was unable to detect the native cP2X4R due to a low level expression of the native P2X4R or a low affinity of the antibody for the receptor or both. Therefore, antisense treatment of the myocytes expressing only native P2X4R could not have detected any decrease in its level using this antibody. On the other hand, overexpression of the exogenous recombinant receptor would allow the antibody to detect the receptor and thus the effect of antisense oligonucleotide treatment on the level of the receptor. That the antisense treatment effectively decreased the level of the overexpressed recombinant cP2X4R suggested that the same treatment should also have reduced or eliminated the native P2X4 receptor. Use of the cP2X4R-overexpressing myocyte was to demonstrate that antisense treatment can effectively reduce the level of the receptor. If the native cP2X4R is involved in mediating the 2-meSATP-stimulated response, one would expect that such antisense oligonucleotide treatment would inhibit such a response. The present data demonstrated that this was indeed the case. Antisense oligonucleotide treatment abrogated the P2 agonist-stimulated45Ca influx (−17 ± −7.8%, n = 3, ± S.E.) (Fig. 3, b and c). Similarly, antisense oligonucleotide treatment also blocked the 2-meSATP-stimulated increase in contractile amplitude (3.1 ± 1%, n = 13 cells from four cultures) (Fig. 3, b and d). On the other hand, myocytes transfected with pcDNA3 (mock-transfected) or with the sense oligonucleotide showed increases of 41.6 ± 13.8 and 61 ± 20% (n = 3, ± S.E.) in the level of45Ca influx in response to 2-meSATP, respectively. Sense oligonucleotide-treated myocytes showed a preserved response to 2-meSATP with a 33 ± 3.3% (n = 10 cells from four cultures) increase in contractile amplitude (Fig. 3, band d). Overall, these data provide more definitive evidence that the P2X4 receptor serves a physiological role, that of mediating an increase in the myocyte contractility and calcium influx in response to ATP. Having established an important physiological role for the P2X4R, its further biochemical characterization was carried out. The cP2X4R detected on the Western blot represented the exogenous recombinant chick P2X4R that was overexpressed following transfection of its cDNA. The anti-cP2X4R antibody detected two major bands, 58- and 44–45-kDa proteins, in an immunoblot of membranes from cP2X4R-overexpressing myocytes (Fig. 3A). The detected molecular mass of the P2X4 receptor in immunoblotting was 58 kDa, consistent with that described by others for the rat P2X4 receptor (20Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 641-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Lê K-T. Villeneuve P. Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. Beaudet A. Séguéla P. Neuroscience. 1998; 83: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because the calculated molecular mass of P2X4 receptor is 44–45 kDa, the greater detected molecular mass of 58 kDa may be due to a post-translational modification such as glycosylation, given the presence of seven potential glycosylation sites in the extracellular loop of the P2X4 receptor (16Rettinger J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33542-33547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, the P2X4R-overexpressing myocytes were treated with tunicamycin, a widely used specific inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation. Tunicamycin caused the disappearance of the 58-kDa band (Fig. 4a). A similar result was obtained when myocytes overexpressing the human P2X4R were treated with tunicamycin (data not shown). These data supported the notion that the P2X4 receptor is glycosylated in cardiac myocytes, similar to the glycosylation of P2X1 and P2X2 receptors (15Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14845-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Rettinger J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33542-33547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). At later time points following the transfection with exogenous cP2X4R cDNA, only the 58-kDa receptor protein was present (Fig. 4b), consistent with a more complete glycosylation of the exogenous cP2X4R. Only the 58-kDa P2X4 receptor was detectable in cardiac myocytes isolated from adult wild type mouse and from P2X4receptor transgenic mice, which showed an increased receptor-mediated contractility (11Hu B. Mei Q. Smith E. Barry W.H. Liang B.T. FASEB J. 2001; 10: 2739-2741Google Scholar). These data suggested that the 58-kDa receptor protein, probably representing the glycosylated P2X4receptor, is the final and functional form of the receptor. At the intermediate time point (i.e. 36–48 h following transfection with the cP2X4R cDNA), the presence of both glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of the receptor provided a unique system to further study the role of glycosylation in maintaining the biochemical property of P2X4 receptors. To characterize the role of N-linked glycosylation in modulating the biochemical property of the P2X4 receptor, studies were carried out to test the hypothesis that glycosylation is needed for cell surface expression of the P2X4 receptor and for maintaining the detergent solubility of the receptor. Glycosylation has been reported to play an important role in intracellular trafficking and in the cell surface localization of various receptors and many other membrane-associated proteins. To test this possibility on the P2X4 receptor, cP2X4R-overexpressing myocytes were biotinylated to label the cell surface receptor and treated with or without tunicamycin. The labeled receptor was extracted and precipitated by streptavidin-agarose beads. Immunoblotting with the anti-cP2X4R antibody showed that tunicamycin could completely block the cell surface expression of P2X4receptor (Fig. 5b), suggesting that N-linked glycosylation is required for its localization on the plasma membrane. While SDS sample buffer could extract both glycosylated and nonglycosylated P2X4 receptors, only the glycosylated receptor can be solubilized by 1% Triton X-114 (Fig. 4a). In fact, the nonglycosylated receptor (the 44–45-kDa protein) was resistant to various extraction conditions such as 1% Triton X-114 in the presence or the absence of 1% deoxycholic acid or 0.5m urea (Fig. 6) or other conditions such as 1% Nonidet P-40 or 1 m urea (not shown). SDS, at the reduced concentration of 1.3%, was able to solubilize the 44–45-kDa nonglycosylated receptor (Fig.5a). However, only the 58-kDa receptor, and not the 44–45-kDa receptor (also extracted by 1.3% SDS), could be precipitated by streptavidin (Fig. 5b). Thus, the 44–45-kDa receptor was not labeled with biotin, indicating that the nonglycosylated P2X4 receptor failed to localize on the plasma membrane. Together, these data suggested that glycosylation was necessary for maintaining the receptor’s detergent solubility property and cell surface expression. Showing that the cell surface localization of the receptor requires glycosylation is clearly important for the function of these receptors, since they are ligand-gated receptor channels on the plasma membrane. Overall, the present study revealed a novel physiological function of the P2X4 receptor and indicated the importance of N-linked glycosylation in maintaining its biochemical property and cell surface expression.

https://openalex.org/W1975275461,"Starch-branching enzymes (SBE) have a dominant role for amylopectin structure as they define chain length and frequency of branch points. We have previously shown that one of the SBE isoforms of kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), designated PvSBE2, has a molecular mass (82 kDa) significantly smaller than those reported for isologous SBEs from pea (SBEI), maize (BEIIb), and rice (RBE3). Additionally, in contrast to the dual location of the pea SBEI in both the soluble and starch granule fractions, PvSBE2 was found only in the soluble fraction during seed development. Analysis of a pvsbe2 cDNA suggested that PvSBE2 is generated from a larger precursor with a putative plastid targeting sequence of 156 residues. Here we describe the occurrence of a larger 100-kDa form (LF-PvSBE2) of PvSBE2 found both in the soluble and starch granule fractions of the developing seeds. The determined N-terminal sequence, VKSSHDSD, of LF-PvSBE2 corresponded to a peptide sequence located 111 amino acids upstream from the N terminus of purified PvSBE2, suggesting that LF-PvSBE2 and PvSBE2 are products of the same gene. Analysis of the products by 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and reverse transcription PCR indicated that the two transcripts for pre-LF-PvSBE2 and pre-PvSBE2 are generated by alternative splicing. Recombinant LF-PvSBE2 (rLF-PvSBE2) was purified from Escherichia coli and the kinetic properties were compared with those of recombinant PvSBE2 (rPvSBE2). rLF-PvSBE2 had much higher affinity for amylopectin (K m = 4.4 mg/ml) than rPvSBE2 (18.4 mg/ml), whereas theV max of rLF-PvSBE2 (135 units/mg) for this substrate was much lower than that of rPvSBE2 (561 units/mg). These results suggest that the N-terminal extension of LF-PvSBE2 plays a critical role for localization in starch granules by altering its enzymatic properties.

These results suggest that the N-terminal extension of LF-PvSBE2 plays a critical role for localization in starch granules by altering its enzymatic properties. Starch, one of the most important carbon reserves in plants, is composed of two glucan polymers, amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is mainly a linear array of glucosyl residues connected by α-1,4-linkages, whereas amylopectin is a branched polymer of α-1,4-linked glucosyl residues with branched α-1,6-linkages. The biosynthesis of amylose and amylopectin are mediated by the enzymes ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases, starch synthases, starch-branching enzymes, and starch-debranching enzymes (1.Smith A.M.

Smith E.E. Whelan W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SBE is a member of the α-amylase family of enzymes, characterized by four highly conserved regions and a central (β/α)8 barrel domain (4.Jespersen H.M. MacGregor E.A. Henrissat B. Sierks M.R. Svensson B. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Apart from the barrel domain, SBEs show considerable structural variation in the length and amino acid sequences at the N- and C-terminal regions. Multiple SBE isozymes have been found in individual plant species and are encoded by two gene families (families A and B) based on the primary sequences. Members of the two families display distinct enzymatic properties, presumably because of the differences in N- and C-terminal regions. Several studies have shown that the N-terminal region is important for specificity of transferred chain length and is required for maximum enzyme activity (5.Kuriki T. Stewart D.C. Preiss J. J. Biol.

However, the starch-bound SBEs and SSs are not considered active in starch biosynthesis. Their association with the starch granule has been suggested to be due simply to their being trapped within the starch granule during its growth and maturation (8.Denyer K. Sidebottom C. Hylton C.M. Smith A.M. Plant J. 1993; 4: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11.Mu-Forster C. Huang R. Powers J.R. Harriman R.W. Knight M. Singletary G.W. Keeling P.L. Wasserman B.P. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recently a novel granule-bound SBE has been isolated from wheat endosperm (15.Båga M. Nair R.B. Repellin A. Scoles G.J. Chibbar R.N. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This SBE is much larger (152 kDa) than previously characterized family A-type SBEs and contains not only the intact SBEI primary sequence but also an extra N-terminal domain formed by partial duplication of the SBEI sequence located near the N terminus. This N-terminal domain is likely responsible for binding of this SBE isoform to the starch granule. To investigate the relationships between structure and function of SBEs, as well as its mode of action in starch biosynthesis, we isolated and characterized a SBE isozyme (PvSBE2) from immature seeds of the kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (16.Nozaki K. Hamada S. Nakamori T. Ito H. Sagisaka S. Yoshida H. Takeda Y. Honma M. Matsui H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A comparison of the determined N-terminal sequence of purified PvSBE2 to the primary sequence derived from pvsbe2 cDNA suggested that PvSBE2 was produced from a preprotein with a plastid signal leader sequence of 156 residues (16.Nozaki K. Hamada S. Nakamori T. Ito H. Sagisaka S. Yoshida H. Takeda Y. Honma M. Matsui H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17.Hamada S. Nozaki K.

Additionally, comparison of the primary sequence of PvSBE2 to other plant SBEs such as pea SBEI (18.Smith A.M. Planta. 1988; 175: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,19.Burton R.A. Bewley J.D. Smith A.M. Bhattacharyya M.K. Tatge H. Ring S. Bull V. Hamilton W.D.O. Martin C. Plant J. 1995; 7: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), maize BEIIb (20.Boyer C.D. Preiss J. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 61: 321-334Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21.Fisher D.K. Boyer C.D. Hannah L.C. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1045-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and rice RBE3 (22.Mizuno K. Kawasaki T. Shimada H. Satoh H. Kobayashi E. Okumura S. Arai Y. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19084-19091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that despite sharing considerable sequence homology with these other SBEs, PvSBE2 is shorter by about 50–100 amino acid residues (Fig. 1, A andB). Moreover, unlike the pea SBEI, which is observed in both the soluble and starch granule fractions (8.Denyer K. Sidebottom C. Hylton C.M. Smith A.M. Plant J. 1993; 4: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), PvSBE2 protein is present only in the soluble fractions during seed development (17.Hamada S. Nozaki K. Ito H. Yoshimoto Y. Yoshida H. Hiraga S. Honma M. Takeda Y. Matsui H. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 23-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we suspected the existence of a larger form of PvSBE2 for which the molecular mass would be closer to pea SBEI. Here, we describe the occurrence of a larger form (LF-PvSBE2) of PvSBE2 containing an extended N terminus of 111 residues. This larger enzyme form is observed in both the soluble and starch granule fractions of kidney bean developing seeds. Immunoblot and molecular analyses suggest that there are two possible mechanisms for generating LF-PvSBE2 and PvSBE2: a post-translational modification and alternative splicing. In addition to their different subcellular locations, LF-PvSBE2 and PvSBE2 have distinct enzymatic properties. Based on the results obtained in this study, the relationship between the enzymatic properties and subcellular locations of both isoforms is discussed. Kidney bean (P. vulgaris L. cv. toramame) seeds were harvested from plants grown at an experimental field of Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan. Seeds were isolated at different stages of development and separated as small- (4–8 mm), mid- (10–12 mm), and large-size (14–16 mm) developing seeds and mature seeds; they were stored at −20 °C until use. Starch granules were extracted from developing seeds of kidney bean essentially according to the procedure described by Smith (23.Smith A.M. Planta. 1990; 182: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with the exception that starch granules were allowed to sediment under gravity at room temperature for 1 h instead of centrifugation. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) of the kidney bean homogenates was used as a soluble fraction. To identify the occurrence of LF-PvSBE2 in developing seeds and to determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence of LF-PvSBE2, starch granule-bound proteins were prepared from isolated starch granules of mid-size developing seeds according to the procedure described by Båga et al. (15.Båga M. Nair R.B. Repellin A. Scoles G.J. Chibbar R.N. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For the semi-quantification and distribution of each polypeptide by immunoblot analysis, starch granule-bound proteins were obtained by dissolution of the isolated starch granules in dimethyl sulfoxide and subsequent dilution with deionized water. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of LF-PvSBE2 was determined by a protein sequencer after the peptide was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane from SDS-PAGE (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed with rPvSBE2 antiserum as described previously (17.Hamada S. Nozaki K. Ito H. Yoshimoto Y. Yoshida H. Hiraga S. Honma M. Takeda Y. Matsui H. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 23-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from the expanded leaves of kidney bean plants by the method of Murray and Thompson (28.Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4321-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9497) Google Scholar). The DNA was partially digested with Sau3AI and fragments (10–20 kb in size) were inserted into the BamHI site of λ EMBL3 (Stratagene). The recombinant DNAs were packaged into bacteriophage particles (GIGA pack Gold-III; Stratagene) and grown onEscherichia coli LE392 (P2). The genomic library consisting of 3.6 × 105 was screened with a digoxigenin-labeled probe using a digoxigenin DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The probe (about 1.4 kb) was prepared by PCR using genomic DNA as a template and specific primers within the second and third exons of the pvsbe2 gene (5′-CCT TGC TGT AAA ATC TTC TCA TGA TTC TG-3′ and 5′-CAT AAC CTA GAG GAT CTA ACC ATG GAA G-3′), based on the cDNA sequence. The methods used for hybridization and detection of the signals were as described previously (17.Hamada S. Nozaki K. Ito H. Yoshimoto Y. Yoshida H. Hiraga S. Honma M. Takeda Y. Matsui H. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 23-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SalI/BglII genomic fragment containing the partial promoter region and the third intron was isolated and sequenced. DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (29.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using a Thermo Sequenase Cycle Sequencing kit (United States Biochemical Corp.). Total RNA was isolated from small-, mid-, and large-size developing seeds as well as mature seeds of the kidney bean as described previously (17.Hamada S. Nozaki K. Ito H. Yoshimoto Y. Yoshida H. Hiraga S. Honma M. Takeda Y. Matsui H. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 23-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5′-RACE was done using total RNA from mid-size developing seeds with a 5′-RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends kit (Version 2.0; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The first strand synthesis was primed with the specific primer topvsbe2 cDNA (945ANTI, 5′-AAT TGG TGG TGA ACC ATC CAC ATT GTT TG-3′). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was used to add homopolymeric (C) tails to the 3′-end of the first strand cDNAs. For amplification of target cDNA, the first round PCR was performed with the dC-tailed cDNAs as templates using the Abridged Anchor Primer (5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT ACG GGI IGG GII GGG IIG-3′, where I is inosine) and the 945ANTI primer. These amplified products were then subjected to a second round of PCR with the Abridged Universal Amplification Primer (5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT AC-3′) and the nested specific primer (745ANTI, 5′-ATG CAT CCA GGC CAC CTT CAT GCT TG-3′). The amplified DNA was separated on a 2% agarose gel, purified, subcloned into pT7Blue TA-vector (Novagen), and then sequenced. RT-PCR was performed using an RNA LA-PCR kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RT products were prepared from total RNA of small-, mid-, and large-size developing seeds and mature seeds using an oligo-dT adaptor primer and avian myeloblast virus reverse transcriptase. The RT products forpvsbe2 transcripts were amplified using the specific primers (231 SEN, 5′-TCT CAG AAA GAA CAA CTT CTC TC-3′ and 745ANTI). RT-PCR for kidney bean actin transcripts was also done using the specific primers (KBACT-N, 5′-GGA CGA GGC TCA ATC GAA GA-3′; and KBACT-C, 5′-ACT GAC ACC GTC TCC GGA GT-3′). Plasmids for the expression of LF-PvSBE2 protein in E. coli cells were constructed as follows. A 1,092-bp cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR with LF-SEN (5′-CCC CAT GGT AAA ATC TTC TCA TGA TTC TG-3′) and SBE2-A (5′-GAC TTA GGA TCC TCT GGG GTT CC-3′) primers, using the pvsbe2 cDNA cloned into pBluescript II SK (pBS-PvSbe2; 17) as a template. The amplified fragment was digested with NcoI/KpnI and then cloned together with the KpnI/SacI fragment from pBS-PvSbe2 into the NcoI/SacI sites of pET23d(+) (Novagen, Inc.). The resulting plasmid, designated pET-LFPvSbe2, was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain (Novagen). Crude extract was obtained according to the previously described method (17.Hamada S. Nozaki K. Ito H. Yoshimoto Y. Yoshida H. Hiraga S. Honma M. Takeda Y. Matsui H. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 23-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from cell cultures grown at 25 °C. After dialysis against buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA), the crude extract was applied onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (2.0 × 11.5 cm). The column was washed with buffer A, and then the enzyme was eluted using a 0- 0.4 m NaCl gradient. Enzyme active fractions were dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA) and then chromatographed on a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (1.3 × 10 cm) using a 0–0.3 m NaCl gradient. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and fractionated on a Bio-Gel P-200 column (2.9 × 71 cm) equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.1m NaCl. The active fractions were dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA and applied to a hydroxyapatite (Seikagaku Corp, Tokyo) column (1.3 × 8.0 cm). The enzyme solution was eluted with a 5–200 mm linear gradient in sodium phosphate buffer. SBE activity was determined by the following two methods. The iodine staining assay (Assay I) was performed according to the method of Boyer and Preiss (20.Boyer C.D. Preiss J. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 61: 321-334Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which monitors the decrease in absorbance at 660 nm for amylose (potato amylose type III, Sigma) or at 540 nm for amylopectin (potato amylopectin, Sigma) as substrates. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount that decreased the absorbance of 0.1 at 660 or 540 nm/min at 30 °C. The branching linkage assay (Assay BL) was done by the method of Takeda et al. (25.Takeda Y. Guan H.P. Preiss J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 240: 253-263Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar) using reduced amylose as a substrate. One unit of the enzyme activity was defined as 1 μmol of branch linkages formed/min at 30 °C. pH stability, optimum temperature, thermal stability, citrate effects, and kinetic parameters were examined as described previously (16.Nozaki K. Hamada S. Nakamori T. Ito H. Sagisaka S. Yoshida H. Takeda Y. Honma M. Matsui H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mixtures (500 μl) of rPvSBE2 or rLF-PvSBE2 containing 50 mg of raw potato starch (Sigma) were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and then briefly centrifuged (10,000 × g for 30 s). The amount of SBE activity remaining in the supernatant was then measured by Assay I as described above. Rhizopus sp. glucoamylase (Nagase Biochemicals, Osaka, Japan) was used as a positive control of the enzyme containing a raw starch-binding domain. Glucoamylase activity was assayed by determining the amount of glucose liberated from a substrate (potato soluble starch) by the modified Tris-glucose oxidase-peroxidase method (26.Takeda Y. Matsui H. Tanida M. Takao S. Chiba S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 1633-1641Google Scholar) using a Glu ARII kit (Wako Pure Chemical, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) as described previously (26.Takeda Y. Matsui H. Tanida M. Takao S. Chiba S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 1633-1641Google Scholar). Chain transfer patterns of rPvSBE2 and rLF-PvSBE2 were determined by a modified method described by Hanasiro et al. (27.Hanashiro I. Abe J. Hizukuri S. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 283: 151-159Crossref Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Reduced amylose was incubated in 500 μl of 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5) at 30 °C with 1 milliunit (determined by Assay BL) of rPvSBE2 or 2–10 milliunits of rLF-PvSBE2. After being incubated for 4 h, the samples were boiled for 1.5 min to inactivate the enzyme activity and then debranched by incubation with isoamylase (0.3 units) in 0.1m sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.5) for 2.5 h at 45 °C. The debranching reaction was terminated when the samples were boiled for 3 min. The reaction mixtures were passed through a 0.2-μm filter and then analyzed by HPAEC-PAD. Immunoblot analysis of the soluble and starch granule fractions prepared from developing kidney bean seeds (mid-size) showed that anti-rPvSBE2 reacted with the 82-kDa PvSBE2 located in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1 C, lane SF). PvSBE2 was not detected in the starch granule fraction, although a 100-kDa protein associated with the starch granule fraction was readily evident (Fig. 1 C, lane GF). To determine the nature of the 100-kDa starch granule-associated protein, its N-terminal sequence was determined by Edman degradation (Fig. 1 D). The generated amino acid sequence, VKSSHDSD, of the 100-kDa polypeptide aligns with the primary sequence deduced from the pvsbe2 cDNA (17.Hamada S. Nozaki K. Ito H. Yoshimoto Y. Yoshida H. Hiraga S. Honma M. Takeda Y. Matsui H. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 23-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) beginning at residue position 46. This peptide sequence was 111 residues upstream of the mature N terminus of purified PvSBE2 (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the 100-kDa starch granule-associated polypeptide in mid-size seeds is a larger isoform of PvSBE2 (designated LF-PvSBE2). The spatial localization of LF-PvSBE2 and PvSBE2 during the development of kidney bean seeds was examined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2 A). PvSBE2 was detected only in soluble fractions from small-, mid-, and large-size developing seeds but not in mature seeds. In contrast, LF-PvSBE2 was found mostly in the starch granule and soluble fractions at the latter stages of seed development when the rates of starch biosynthesis are at their maximal levels and then begin to slow down. The relative amounts of each SBE2 isoform were estimated from the intensities of known amounts of loaded rPvSBE2 protein (Fig. 2 B). The levels of PvSBE2 protein peak at the mid-stage of seed development and then drop off at later stages when starch levels begin to increase rapidly. In contrast, the levels of LF-PvSBE2 protein parallel the increase in starch levels (17.Hamada S. Nozaki K. Ito H. Yoshimoto Y. Yoshida H. Hiraga S. Honma M. Takeda Y. Matsui H. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 23-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are relatively low in mid-developing seeds and then increase dramatically at the later stage when starch levels also increase. More than 75% of the total SBE2 protein is contributed by LF-PvSBE2 protein, whereas PvSBE2 comprises less than 25%. About half of the amount of LF-PvSBE2 was located in the starch granule fractions at the later stages of seed development. These results indicate that kidney bean seeds contain two SBE2 forms: a smaller PvSBE2 isoform, which attains maximum levels when starch levels begin to increase, and a larger LF-PvSBE2 isoform in which the temporal accumulation pattern coincides with starch synthesis. To determine whether LF-PvSBE2 and PvSBE2 were differently spliced products of the same gene, 5′-RACE was performed using total RNA from mid-size developing seeds of kidney bean (Fig. 3 A). Two distinct bands of about 0.75 and 0.55 kb (denoted as I and II, respectively, in Fig. 3 A) were detected in the 5′-RACE products, which were sequenced together with a partial pvsbe2 gene fragment corresponding to the 5′ coding sequences. The nucleotide sequence alignment between the two amplified cDNAs and the partial gene fragment demonstrated that both amplified cDNAs were derived from the same pvsbe2 gene and that the two transcripts were generated by alternative splicing (Fig. 3, B andC). The sequence of the larger RNA transcript I was identical to the previously determined pvsbe2cDNA. In contrast, the sequence of the smaller transcript II was composed of truncated exons 1 (exon 1′) and 2 (exon 2′) as well as intact exon 3 at the 5′-end, suggesting that the translation commences with the Met residue at position 99 of the derived pvsbe2primary sequence. Overall, pre-LF-PvSBE2 and PvSBE2 are coded by two distinct RNA transcripts formed by alternative splicing of introns during transcription. To access the relative levels of the two prsbe2 transcripts during kidney bean seed development, RT-PCR was performed using RNA isolated from seeds at different stages of development (Fig. 3 D). The amplified DNA levels derived from actin RNA were constant during seed development and used as an internal control (Fig. 3 D, lower panel). Two amplified bands corresponding to transcripts I and II were evident at all stages of seed development although their temporal accumulation patterns were distinct. Transcript I peaked during the mid-stage of seed development, whereas transcript II showed high levels at the mid- and late-stages of seed development (Fig. 3 D, upper and middle panels). The temporal RNA accumulation patterns displays by transcript I (pre-LF-PvSBE2) and II (pre-PvSBE2) were different from those observed for the SBE2 isoforms (Fig. 3 E), suggesting that the regulation of the two SBE2 isoforms occurs post-translationally. rLF-PvSBE2 enzyme was produced in the E. coli cells and purified by four successive column chromatography steps (Table I) in order to investigate its enzymatic properties. The final enzyme preparation from 1.2 liters of cultured cells contained 9.0 mg of rLF-PvSBE2 with a specific activity of 170 units/mg using amylose as a substrate. The specific activity was about 80% of that (214 units/mg) measured for purified rPvSBE2. The specific activity of purified rPvSBE2 under the same assay conditions was nearly identical (223 units/mg) to that of the native PvSBE2 purified from immature seeds (16.Nozaki K. Hamada S.

Purified rLF-PvSBE2 migrated as a single polypeptide band with the same mobility as the immunoreacted protein from starch granule fractions on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, A and B).Table IPurification of recombinant LF-PvSBE2 expressed in E. coli BL21ProcedureTotal protein1-aProtein concentrations were calculated under the assumption that E 1cm1% at 280 nm is 10.Total activity1-bThese activities were measured by Assay I method using amylose as a substrate.Specific activityPurificationYieldmgunitsunits/mg-fold%Crude extract7,2007,0400.981100DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (1st)2335,140222273DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (2nd)643,230505146Bio-Gel P-20019.62,84014514840Hydroxyapatite9.01,530170173221-a Protein concentrations were calculated under the assumption that E 1cm1% at 280 nm is 10.1-b These activities were measured by Assay I method using amylose as a substrate.

To fulfill their detoxifying role, they catalyze the metabolism of a wide spectrum of structurally unrelated substances (1Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J.

P450s are often inducible by their own substrates allowing dynamic adaptation to xenobiotic exposure (2Okey A.B. Pharmacogenetics of Drug Metabolism. Pergamon Press, Elmsford, NY1992: 549-608Google Scholar). Together with CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2, the enzymes of the CYP2C subfamily are mainly responsible for drug metabolism in human (3Michalets E.L. Pharmacotherapy. 1998; 18: 84-112PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore can cause drug interactions. Diazepam (4Yasumori T. Nagata K. Yang S.K. Chen L.S. Murayama N. Yamazoe Y. Kato R.

CYP2Cgenes show a variety of regulation patterns including sex-dependent regulation (9Czerniak R. Int. J. Toxicol. 2001; 20: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), constitutive expression, or transcriptional activation by classical P450 inducers such as phenobarbital (PB), dexamethasone (DEX), and rifampicine (10Morel F.

In the last few years, major advances in understanding the molecular mechanism of P450 induction have been achieved. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) has been identified as a CYP2Bactivator in mouse and human liver (11Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 12Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Zelko I. Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol.

The role of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) in CYP3A induction has been investigated by several groups (13Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Wade L. Staudinger J.L. Watson M.A. Jones S.A. McKee D.D. Oliver B.B.

CAR and PXR both bind to their cognate DNA elements as heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and thereby stimulate P450 target gene transcription (16Negishi M. Honkakoski P. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2000; 11: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two direct, inverted or everted repeats surrounding a nuclear factor 1 binding site (NF1), have been described as common features of phenobarbital response enhancer units (PBRU) of CYP2B genes. Similar structures but lacking an NF1 site have been defined as PBRUs in CYP3Agenes. In addition, it has been shown that both CAR and PXR can activate CYP2B and CYP3A genes with credit to their similar DNA binding preferences (17Honkakoski P. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Only little progress has been accomplished in understanding the molecular mechanism of CYP2C induction. Although human CYP2C 5′-flanking regions have extensively been analyzed (18Kemper B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 23-64PubMed Google Scholar), the PB response has not been associated with any DNA sequences of these genes to date (19Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 20Klose T.S. Blaisdell J.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 1999; 13: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recently, the effect of known PXR and CAR activators on CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, andCYP2C19 mRNA has been analyzed (21Gerbal-Chaloin S. Pascussi J.M. Pichard-Garcia L. Daujat M. Waechter F. Fabre J.M. Carrere N. Maurel P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 242-251PubMed Google Scholar). The results are consistent with an involvement of CAR, PXR, and the glucocorticoid receptor in CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 mRNA induction. The chicken xenobiotic receptor CXR was cloned and identified as an activator of the chicken CYP2H1 gene (22Handschin C. Podvinec M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has activation properties similar to CAR and PXR and also activates PBRUs of mouse, rat, and human P450s (23Handschin C. Podvinec M. Stockli J. Hoffmann K. Meyer U.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1571-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning and characterization of the avian CYP2C45 gene. Furthermore we describe the identification of a first PBRU in the 5′-flanking region of a CYP2C gene and the requirement of a DR-4 nuclear receptor binding site for CXR-mediated induction ofCYP2C45. Computer-assisted primer design was performed using the oligo-primer analysis software, version 5.0 (National Biosciences). Primers were supplied by Microsynth. TaqMan probes coupled to a 5′-fluorophore (FAM) and a 3′-quencher (TAMRA) were manufactured by Eurogentec. Cell culture was carried out as described previously by Ourlin et al. (24Ourlin J.C. Baader M. Fraser D. Halpert J.R. Meyer U.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained under serum-free conditions for 5 h before transfection or drug exposure. Cells were transiently transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Rothrenz, Switzerland) according to the supplier’s protocol. Cells were induced for 16 h with following drug concentrations: 600 μmfor PB and MET, 50 μm for DEX, rifampicine, pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile, phenytoin, and 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene, and 10 μmfor clotrimazole. Total RNA was isolated from chicken liver tissue using the peqGOLD RNAPureTM reagent (Axon Laboratories AG, CH) and subsequently reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)14N primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Sequence alignments of fish CYP2 genes were used to design primers in conserved regions (CYPdeg-fwd, 5′-CCNCGNGAYTAYATYGA-3′, and CYPdeg-rev, 5′-AANARRAANARYTCCAT-3′), and a CYP2-related DNA fragment was amplified from a chicken cDNA library. Primers CYP-fwd (5′-CCGGGACTATATCGACTGCTTCC-3′) and CYP-rev (5′-CAGGAAGAGCTCCATGCGCGCC-3′) were designed based on this sequence and used for PCR amplification of a 550-bp fragment from chicken cDNA. A chicken liver λZAP® cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened using the 32P random prime- labeled 550-bp probe (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). pBluescript phagemids were in vivo excised from isolated positive colonies using the ExAssist/SOLR system according to the manufacturer’s protocol and analyzed by automated sequencing (ABI 373A, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primers cod1-fwd (5′-CCGTGCCCACGTGGGAGATGTTGCT-3′ in exon 1) and cod396-rev (5′-GAGAGCAAACCGCCGAAC-3′ in exon 3) were used for PCR amplification of a 1.2-kb fragment from chicken genomic DNA. Six positive clones resulted from hybridization of chicken BAC filters (UK Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Center, United Kingdom) with the 32P-radiolabeled 1.2-kb genomic DNA probe. BAC clones 25-P8, 86-J8, and 44-H2 were digested with ApaI,NcoI, NsiI, and PstI and further analyzed by Southern blotting using the 1.2-kb probe. A 3.6-kbNsiI fragment overlapping with exon 1 was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced by primer walking starting with vector-specific pBS-fwd (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTG-3′) and pBS-rev (5′-CTATGACCATGATTACGCCAAG-3′) primers. LMH cells were transfected with a pCI-CYP2C45 construct or with empty pCI vector as mentioned above. Cells were harvested in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol after 48 h and sonicated five times for 3 s on ice with an amplitude of 15 μm. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 9000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and subsequently centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Microsomal pellets were resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer, and protein concentrations were determined using the protein assay ESL kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Western blotting was performed as described by Ourlin et al. (24Ourlin J.C. Baader M. Fraser D. Halpert J.R. Meyer U.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal goat anti-rat CYP2C6 antibody (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan) and protein G-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad). CYP2C45 activities were measured by an assay of differential oxidation of scoparone. 15 μg of microsomal proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in 100 mmTris buffer, pH 7.6, supplemented with 2 mmMgCl2, 80 μm scoparone, and 7.5 mm NADPH. Metabolites were separated and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously by Meyeret al. (25Meyer R.P. Hagemeyer C.E. Knoth R. Kurz G. Volk B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI PRISMTM 7700 (TaqMan) using the sequence detector software, version 1.6.3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Computer-assisted design of compatible TaqMan primers and probes was carried out with the help of the primer express software, version 1.0 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed as described above, and the obtained cDNAs were diluted 1:5 for further analysis. PCR reactions were performed using TaqMan PCR core reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primer and probe concentrations were optimized as follows: TaqMan-fwd (5′-CGGTGAAAGAAGCCTTGATTG-3′) (900 nm), TaqMan-rev (5′-GGTCCCCGATAGGCATGTG-3′) (300 nm), and TaqMan-probe (5′-FAM-GGCAGCAAACTCATCCGCACGA-TAMRA-3′) (300 nm). The levels of GAPDH housekeeping gene were determined for internal normalization using GAPDH-fwd (5′-GGTCACGCTCCTGGAAGATAGT-3′), GAPDH-rev (5′-GGGCACTGTCAAGGCTGAGA-3′), and GAPDH-probe (5′-FAM-TGGCGTGCCCATTGATCACAAGTTT-TAMRA-3′). 20 μg of total RNA were subjected to electrophoresis on a formamide-containing 1% agarose gel. RNAs were transferred to nylon membrane by overnight blotting in 20× SSC (1× = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate). Membranes were cross-linked using the UV Stratalinker® 2400 (Stratagene). Hybridization was carried out in 50% deionized formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 1% SDS, and 10% (w/v) dextransulfate. The same 32P-radiolabeled 550-bp cDNA probe as used before for the library screening was boiled for 5 min in 500 μl of salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml) and quickly chilled on ice. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 45 °C. Washes were performed in 2× SSC/1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min and 2× SSC/1% SDS at 65° for 20 min. Membranes were exposed to x-ray film using intensifying screens for 12–48 h. A 2.6-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the CYP2C45 gene (from −7 to −2612 bp) containing the homologous promoter was amplified from chicken genomic DNA using primers flank-2.6kb_fwd (5′-GGAATTCGAACACACTGAGATCATCCTG-3′) and flank-2.6kb_rev (5′-GGAATTCGTGGGCACGAGCTTCTGAG-3′) and was subcloned into pGL3-basic reporter vector (Promega). Furthermore, a 2.2-kb fragment lacking 372 bp of the proximal promoter region amplified with primers flank-2614 (5′-GAACACACTGAGATCATCCTG-3′) and flank-373 (5′-TGCCATGTGGGTTTTCTGTTC-3′) and a putative 239-bp PBRU containing a DR-4 nuclear receptor binding site amplified with primers flank-162 (5′-AATCGGCAGCAGAGAGAC-3′) and flank-380 (5′-CTTCTGAAAGACCTTGATGTG-3′) were subcloned into pGL3 reporter vector containing the heterologous SV40 promoter (pGL3-SV40, Promega). The pRSV β-galactosidase vector used for normalization of transfection experiments was kindly provided by Anastasia Kralli (Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland). Site-directed mutagenesis of the DR-4 element in the 2.2-kb and 239-bp fragments was carried out according to the PCRbased method of overlap extension (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) using primers DR4mut-fwd (5′-AAGCTTTCCACTCGAGGCCCTGGCAATGTCGGAG-3′) and DR4mut-rev (5′-CTCGAGTGGAAAGCTTTGCGTCTCTAAGAACTTC-3′) where altered nucleotides are indicated in bold. Primers flank-2614 and flank-373 or flank-162 and flank-380 were used for amplification of mutated overlapping fragments to full-length 2.2 kb or 239 bp, respectively. Mutated fragments were subcloned into pGL3-SV40 as described earlier. Transfected and induced cells were harvested using passive lysis buffer (Promega). Extracts were centrifuged for 3 min to pellet cellular debris. LUC assays were performed on supernatants using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Microlite TLX1 luminometer (Dynatech). Relative β-galactosidase activities were determined for normalization as described by Iniguez-Lluhi et al. (27Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lou D.Y. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4149-4156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 239-bpEcoRI DNA fragment was 32P-radiolabeled by 5′ filling in with Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). CXR and RXR were in vitrosynthesized using the TNT®transcription/translation-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the supplier’s protocol. Assay mixtures contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg of poly(dI·dC), 2.5 μl of in vitro translated products, and 25,000 cpm of 32P-radiolabeled double-stranded DNA probe. The binding reaction was carried out at room temperature for 20 min. For supershift assays, antibodies against RXR or CXR were added to the reaction mixtures. Competition assays were performed with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded DNA. CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Before experiments, CV-1 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 60,000 cells/well in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 medium without phenol red supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfection mixes contained 20 ng of reporter plasmid, 50 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector, 8 ng of expression vector with the exception of CXR where 1 ng was used, and carrier plasmid. 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 without phenol red supplemented with 10% delipidated charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (Sigma) containing the inducers of interest. Cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h and harvested using passive lysis buffer. Cell extracts were measured as mentioned under “Reporter Gene Assay.” A 550-bp fragment was amplified from chicken cDNA using primers derived from P450 sequence alignments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This fragment was used as probe to screen a chicken liver λZAP cDNA library for full-length cDNA. The obtained sequence contained an open reading frame of 1485 bp (Fig.1A) and was denominated CYP2C45by David R. Nelson (drnelson.utmem.edu/biblioA.html) based on high sequence identity with CYP2Cs in other species.Figure 1A, full-length cDNA ofCYP2C45 was cloned from a chicken liver λZAP cDNA library. Translation start (+17) and stop (+1499) codons arehighlighted in boldface. Positions of the first two introns, indicated with bars, were derived from a comparison of the cDNA with the genomic sequence. B, genomic DNA containing a 3.6-kb fragment of 5′-flanking region was obtained from a chicken BAC clone and sequenced by primer walking. The first two exons were determined from overlap with the cDNA sequence and are shaded. The DR-4 nuclear receptor binding site at position −2342, surrounded by a box, turned out to be essential for xenobiotic mediated transcriptional activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A chicken BAC library was screened to obtain 5′-flanking region sequence information. A 3.6-kb fragment was subcloned from a positive BAC clone and further analyzed (Fig. 1B). A computer-assisted search for putative nuclear receptor binding sites was performed using an algorithm developed by Michael Podvinec in our laboratory. 2Podvinec, M., Kaufmann, M. R., Handschin, C., and Meyer, U. A. (2002) Mol. Endocrinol., in press. Immunoblot analysis was performed using an anti-rat CYP2C6 polyclonal antibody cross-reacting with CYP2C45 protein. A CYP2C45-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein had been expressed in BL21 cells to verify this interaction in advance (data not shown). Microsomes prepared from PB-treated rat livers were used as internal control. Transient transfection ofCYP2C45 full-length cDNA in LMH cells led to significant overexpression of a protein of an estimated molecular mass of 55 kDa, which was not detectable in microsomes of control cells (Fig.2). In addition, a weak band migrating close to CYP2C45 was visible in transfected and in control cells. The activity of overexpressed CYP2C45 was measured using an assay of oxidative hydrolysis of scoparone, which had previously been used as a sensitive indicator to distinguish among different P450 isoforms including CYP2Cs (25Meyer R.P. Hagemeyer C.E. Knoth R. Kurz G. Volk B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Weak but significant metabolism of scoparone by overexpressed CYP2C45 in LMH cells was detected (TableI). Isoscopoletin occurred as a main metabolite, whereas only low levels of scopoletin were detected. Small amounts of isoscopoletin were also measured in control cells.Table IScoparone metabolism of CYP2C45IsoscopoletinScopoletinpCI-CYP2C451.77 ± 0.0220.07 ± 0.047pCI-control0.05 ± 0.027n.d.Scoparone metabolism of overexpressed CYP2C45 in LMH cells was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography.

Relative CYP2C45 mRNA levels were determined by TaqMan and Northern blot analysis. A dose response curve for PB is shown in Fig.3A. Maximal induction was obtained with PB concentrations above 600 μm.CYP2C45 mRNA of untreated cells was not detectable on Northern blot. MET was the most potent CYP2C45 inducer in our experimental system followed by PB, pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile, DEX, phenytoin, and clotrimazole. Very weak or no induction was detectable after 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene and rifampicine treatment (Fig. 3B). A similar induction pattern was obtained by LUC reporter gene assays using a reporter construct containing 2.6 kb ofCYP2C45 5′-flanking region including the homologous promoter (Fig. 3C). The role of a DR-4 motif at −2342 bp in CYP2C45 induction was studied by LUC reporter gene assay. Relative LUC activities after Me2SO, PB, and MET treatments were measured for the pGL3-SV40 reporter constructs with following inserts: 2.2-kb fragment wild type, putative 239-bp PBRU wild type, 2.2-kb DR-4 mutant, and 239-bp DR-4 mutant (Fig.4A). The wild type 239-bp fragment retained almost full inducibility compared with the 2.2-kb fragment, whereas the mutation of the DR-4 motif in any of the fragments abolished induction (Fig. 4B). Physical interaction of CXR with the 239-bp fragment was investigated in electromobility shift assays (Fig. 5). Neither CXR nor RXR alone shifted the 32P-radiolabeled 239-bp fragment. However, a shift was observed when adding both CXR and RXR to the reaction mixture. This complex was supershifted with an anti-RXR antibody or disabled by adding an anti-CXR antibody. The shift was completely disabled when competing with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild type DNA. As expected, no shift was observed when using radiolabeled 239-bp DR-4 mutant probe (data not shown). Transactivation assays were performed to demonstrate not only physical but also functional interaction between CXR and the 239-bp fragment. CV-1 monkey kidney cells were co-transfected with CXR expression plasmid and LUC reporter constructs containing 239-bp fragments with wild type or mutant DR-4 motif (Fig. 6A). Treatment with PB or MET led to a 2- or 6-fold increase in reporter gene expression in cells transfected with 239-bp DR-4 wild type construct. No transactivation was observed in cells transfected with 239-bp DR-4-mutated construct. The transactivation of the 239-bp fragment with the mouse receptors PXR and CAR was investigated in CV-1 cells. A 2-fold PXR-mediated activation of the wild type construct was observed with RU486 and pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile, whereas no significant activation was detected with 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (Fig. 6B). However, although no activation was detected in the CAR assay with PB or MET, significant activation of the wild type construct was measured with 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (Fig.6C).Figure 5The 239-bp fragment was32P-radiolabeled and used as probe for electromobility shift assays. In vitro translated CXR and RXR were incubated separately and together with the probe (lanes 2–4). The shifted CXR·RXR complex was supershifted using an anti-RXR antibody (lane 5). Competition was carried out using a 100-fold excess of cold wild type DNA (lane 6). An anti-CXR antibody was added to the reaction together with CXR and RXR protein (lane 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6CV-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with CXR , mouse PXR , or mouse CAR expression plasmids and LUC reporter constructs containing either wild type or mutated 239-bp fragment.Cells were treated for 24 h with various compounds.

A comparison of the derived amino acid sequence with other chicken P450s result in 34–36% identity with CYP1As, 56% identity with CYP2H1, and 26% identity with CYP3A37. Based on sequence comparisons with P450s in other species, the cDNA was assigned to the CYP2C subfamily (Fig. 7). It was denominated CYP2C45, and it represents a first member of the CYP2C subfamily cloned in avian species. Before the discovery of CYP2C45, we had assumed that CYP2H1may represent a chicken CYP2C orthologue based on its regulation by drugs (24Ourlin J.C. Baader M. Fraser D. Halpert J.R. Meyer U.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the observation that CYP2Cs occur in clusters of highly related genes in other species including human and rabbit does not support this hypothesis (28Ioannides C. Human CYP2C. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 162Google Scholar). We have analyzed the transcriptional regulation of CYP2C45in LMH cells. The LMH cell line is the first continuously dividing cell line that maintains phenobarbital-type induction of P450s (29Handschin C. Meyer U.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13362-13369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The basal expression level of CYP2C45 in LMH cells is very low, which means that neither protein nor mRNA is detectable in untreated cells (Figs. 2 and 3A). However, a dose-dependent increase in CYP2C45 mRNA was observed after exposure to increasing PB concentrations (Fig.3A). The effect of several prototypical P450 inducers onCYP2C45 was analyzed both at the mRNA level and in reporter gene assays using a 2.6-kb fragment of its 5′-flanking region (Fig. 3, B and C). The results were compared with data obtained from reporter gene assays with a 264-bp PBRU of theCYP2H1gene (29Handschin C. Meyer U.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13362-13369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similar induction patterns were observed, suggesting a conserved mechanism of induction. Indeed, a structure consisting of a NF1 site and a DR-4 nuclear receptor binding site resembling the CYP2H1 PBRU was discovered in the 2.6-kb fragment. PBRUs of inducible P450 genes in mammals have extensively been studied, and two direct, inverted or everted repeats surrounding NF1, have been described as common features (19Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 30Kim J. Min G. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7559-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, in the case of CYP2H1, a second DR-4 element was only recently detected at a distance of 89 bp from the NF1 site. 2Podvinec, M., Kaufmann, M. R., Handschin, C., and Meyer, U. A. (2002) Mol. Endocrinol., in press. To further characterize the function of the putative CYP2C45 PBRU, we have cloned a 2.2 and 239-bp fragment surrounding the DR-4 and NF1 sites. Both fragments are strongly activated by PB and MET in reporter gene assays. Site-directed mutagenesis of the DR-4 motif abolished the induction in both the 239- and 2.2-kb fragment (Fig. 4). In contrast, a disruption of the NF1 site by site-directed mutagenesis had no effect on induction (data not shown). We have analyzed the interaction of theCYP2C45 239-bp fragment with CXR, which has been identified as an activator of the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU (22Handschin C. Podvinec M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The physical interaction was investigated in electromobility shift assays, whereas the functional interaction was tested in transactivation assays in CV-1 cells. The results uniformly demonstrated the requirement of the DR-4 element for induction and the capability of a CXR-RXR heterodimer to activate the CYP2C45239-bp PBRU. In mammals, CAR was originally identified as CYP2Bactivator, and PXR was identified as CYP3Aactivator. However, overlapping ligand specificities of CAR and PXR and their capability to activate both CYP2Band CYP3APBRUs have been demonstrated (for review see Ref. 17Honkakoski P. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Moreover, the interchangeability of nuclear receptors and PBRUs between mouse, rat, human, and chicken has been investigated in our laboratory (31Handschin C. Podvinec M. Looser R. Amherd R. Meyer U.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 681-689PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated the capability of the mouse receptors PXR and CAR to activate the chicken CYP2C45 239-bp PBRU. In both cases, significant transactivation of the wild type compared with the mutant construct was detected for some inducers, indicating that both PXR and CAR are able to bind to and activate the chicken CYP2C45239-bp PBRU. Conclusively, these results give rise to the hypothesis that the molecular mechanisms of P450 induction are conserved from chicken to mammals and that the induction of humanCYP2C genes might involve the nuclear receptors CAR and PXR as well as PBRU-like structures. Surprisingly, DEX has a strong effect on CYP2C45 mRNA but does only modestly activate the 2.6-kb reporter construct. In contrast to CYP2H1 and inducible CYP2B andCYP3A 5′-flanking regions, no glucocorticoid response element was detected in the 2.2-kb fragment (32Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Thottassery J.V. Guzelian P.S. Strom S. Sun D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 63-72PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jaiswal A.K. Haaparanta T. Luc P.V. Schembri J. Adesnik M.

DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). From these observations we suggest that a glucocorticoid response element must be localized outside of the 2.2-kb fragment and mediate the induction ofCYP2C45 by DEX. In conclusion, the analysis of this avian P450of theCYP2C subfamily indicates that the induction of CYP2Cgenes requires the same nuclear receptors and DNA response elements as the induction of CYP2B and CYP3A genes.

The signal used is that of the natural tryptophan at residue δ28, which is enhanced by 50% upon binding of δ-subunit to α3β3γε complex.Kd for δ binding is 1.4 nm, which is energetically equivalent (50.2 kJ/mol) to that required to resist the rotor strain. Only one site for δ binding was detected. The δW28L mutation increased Kd to 4.6 nm, equivalent to a loss of 2.9 kJ/mol binding energy. While this was insufficient to cause detectable functional impairment, it did facilitate preparation of δ-depleted F1. The αG29D mutation reduced Kd to 26 nm, equivalent to a loss of 7.2 kJ/mol binding energy. This mutation did cause serious functional impairment, referable to interruption of binding of δ to F1. Results with the two mutants illuminate how finely balanced is the stator resistance function. δ′ fragment, consisting of residues δ1–134, bound with the same Kd as intact δ, showing that, at least in absence of Fo subunits, the C-terminal domain of δ contributes zero binding energy. Mg2+ ions had a strong effect on increasing δ binding affinity, supporting the possibility of bridging metal ion involvement in stator function.

ATP synthesis by oxidative or photophosphorylation is catalyzed by the enzyme ATP synthase. In Escherichia coli the subunit composition is α3β3γδεab2cn. F1 or F1-ATPase is the name given to the α3β3γδε subcomplex, which may be released from the membrane and purified in soluble form showing ATP hydrolysis activity. Fo is the subcomplex that remains behind in the membrane after F1 release. Consisting of ab2cn, it is responsible both for anchoring F1 and for providing the pathway for protons to move through the membrane (1Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys.

ATP-driven rotation of the rotor, specifically of the c-subunit oligomeric ring, brings about proton efflux, and mechanisms for this proton transport have been suggested (11Fillingame R.H. Jiang W.

It is widely assumed, although not yet demonstrated, that influx of protons through Fo down the transmembrane proton gradient reverses the rotor, and that the rotational movement of γ within F1 brings about ATP synthesis in the three catalytic sites. The mechanism by which ATP-driven rotation of subunits occurs, and the mechanism of rotation-driven ATP synthesis, are not yet understood and have most recently been discussed in Refs. 14Weber J.

Cross-linking studies showed proximity of the α- and/or β-subunits to δ, both in E. coli (33Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.X. Keana J.F. Capaldi R.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32737-32742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Other studies in E. coli enzyme implicated the α-subunit N-terminal region as being involved. Removal of the N-terminal 15 or 19 residues from α by proteolytic digestion prevented binding of δ to α3β3γ complex (36Dunn S.D. Heppel L.A. Fullmer C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6891-6896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking of an inserted Cys at residue α2 to a natural Cys in δ was obtained in high yield (37Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The mutation αG29D rendered F1 deficient of δ-subunit and resulted in functional disruption, including partial loss of oxidative phosphorylation in cells, loss of F1binding to Fo in vitro, and loss ATP-driven proton pumping in vitro (38Maggio M.B. Parsonage D. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4619-4623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, while the designation of the N-terminal region of α as a “membrane-binding region” turned out to be well founded (38Maggio M.B. Parsonage D. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4619-4623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (even though this region is actually the part of the enzyme most distant from the membrane) unfortunately none of the available x-ray structures show the extreme N-terminal residues of α or any of δ. Therefore no detailed model of the α/δ interface can be assigned as yet. Questions that have not yet been answered are: 1) does δ-subunit interact functionally with parts of β as well as α, 2) are all three α-subunits (or α/β pairs) involved in binding one δ or is just one α (or α/β) sufficient, 3) what are the region(s) and residues of δ that bind to α and/or β, and 4) what are the residues of the N-terminal of α that are functionally directly involved in δ-binding? Understanding the manner in which the stator functions in ATP synthase is clearly important to understanding the overall process of ATP synthesis, and elucidating the nature of the δ-F1interface in functional and structural terms is one facet of this problem. Our goal in this paper was to develop a quantitative binding assay to determine the binding affinity of δ under true equilibrium conditions and then to quantify the binding affinity accurately in wild-type and in the αG29D mutant. During the project we found that the mutation δW28L also impairs binding, suggesting that this region of δ is likely at or close to the δ-F1 interface. The C-terminal region of δ was found not to contribute any binding energy at the δ-F1 interface. An important role for Mg2+ (or other divalent) ions is shown, and pH was found to profoundly influence δ binding. E. coliF1 was purified as in Ref. 39Weber J. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Wise J.G.

Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For purification of δW28L subunit, the mutation was constructed by directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide described previously (42Wilke-Mounts S. Weber J. Grell E. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem.

After mutagenesis the EcoRI-SmaI fragment was moved back to pJC1 creating the new plasmid pSWM101, which was transformed into strain AH3 and used for expression of δW28L subunit. δ-depleted F1 was prepared as in Ref. 43Smith J.B. Sternweis P.C. Heppel L.A. J. Supramol. Struct. 1975; 2: 248-255Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, except that the gel filtration column consisted of Sephacryl S300HR (1.5 cm × 100 cm). The column buffer was 50 mm glycine/NaOH, pH 9.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, and 10% glycerol at 20 °C, and immediately after recovery the fractions were adjusted to pH 8.0 with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Wild-type F1 was purified from strain SWM1 (44Rao R., Al- Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5569-5573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trp-free F1 was purified from strain pB0W1/DK8, created by transferring a Pme1-EagI fragment from plasmid p0W1(42) into plasmid pRLL2 (45Weber J. Senior A.E.

The following mutations were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as in Ref. 45Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5287-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar using the respective oligonucleotides. 1) αL55W, GAAATGATCTCGTGGCCGGGTAACC, inserts a Trp (TGG) codon and also a new BssS1 site. The template was M13mp18 with an SphI-SalI fragment from p0W1, and after mutagenesis the mutation was moved into pB0W1 on an SphI-Csp45–1 fragment creating new plasmid pSWM89. 2) βF17W, GTTGACGTCGAATGGCCACAGGATGCCG, inserts a Trp codon and an Msc1/BalI site. The template was M13mp18 containing the βW107F mutation in a Hin dII-KpnI fragment from p0W1, and the mutations were moved back into pRLL2 on a Pme1-EagI fragment to create new plasmid pSWM87. 3) βY26W, GGATGCCGTACCACGCGTGTGGGATGCTCTTGAG, inserts a Trp codon and both BstXI and Mlu1 sites. The template and procedure were as for βF17W, and the final plasmid was pSWM88. 4) αG29D, CTCACAACGAAGACACTATTGTTTCTG, adds a Bbs1 site. The template was the same as for αL55W mutagenesis above, and the αG29D mutation was moved into plasmid pSWM86 (above) on a SphI-Csp45–1 fragment to create new plasmid pSWM93. Each of the plasmids pSWM87,88,89, and 93 were transformed into strain DK8 for purification of F1. Tryptophan fluorescence was measured in a spectrofluorometer type SPEX Fluorolog 2 at 23 °C. λexc was 295 nm. The buffer was 50 mmHEPES/NaOH, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0, unless noted otherwise. Binding of δ to δ-depleted F1 was measured by adding increasing concentrations of isolated δ-subunit to 10 or 50 nm enzyme and monitoring the fluorescence at 325 nm. Background signals, including enzyme fluorescence and fluorescence of free δ, determined in parallel control experiments, were subtracted. The binding-induced increase in δ fluorescence was plotted versus the total δ concentration, and from the resulting curves Kd values were determined by nonlinear regression. Kd for binding of δW28L mutant subunit was estimated from competition experiments in which δ-depleted F1 was preincubated with a given concentration of δW28L subunit, and then wild-type δ was added. From the change in Kdapp for wild-type δ due to the presence of δW28L mutant, Kd for the mutant was calculated. Acridine orange fluorescence quenching was followed as an indicator of ATP-driven proton pumping (48Perlin D.S. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9793-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were stripped of F1by KSCN-extraction (48Perlin D.S. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9793-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For reconstitution of F1Fo, stripped membranes (500 μg of protein) were preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 500 μl with F1 (100 μg) or δ-depleted F1 (100 μg) plus appropriate amounts of δ-subunit or δ′ fragment (10 μg, unless otherwise indicated). 400 μl of this mixture were added to 1.6 ml of assay buffer (100 mm HEPES/NaOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, pH 7.5). Acridine orange (4 μm) fluorescence was continuously recorded in a spectrofluorometer type SLM AMINCO AB2 (λexc 430 nm, λem 565 nm). Proton gradient formation was initiated by addition of 1 mm ATP and terminated by addition of 10 μm CCCP. Assays of ATPase activity, protein concentration by Bradford assay, and SDS-gel electrophoresis on 10–20% gradient gels were as described (49Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Hammond S.T. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12042-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As discussed in the Introduction, current evidence favors the view that δ-subunit binds to F1 at the “top” of the molecule, distant from the membrane. Our initial approach was to insert single Trp residues into the N-terminal β-barrel domains of α- or β-subunits, with the hope that upon binding of δ, one or more of these would show perturbation of the Trp fluorescence signal. Conserved aromatic or leucine residues were targeted. The following mutations were made: αL55W, βF17W, and βY26W. Each was expressed in the Trp-free background (42Wilke-Mounts S. Weber J. Grell E. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) previously used in this laboratory to characterize nucleotide-binding properties of the enzyme (e.g. Ref. 49Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Hammond S.T. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12042-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Trp-free background contains the mutations δW28L/αW513F/γW108Y/γW206Y/βW107F and it was previously shown that Trp-free F1 is functionally similar to wild-type (42Wilke-Mounts S. Weber J. Grell E. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition the naturally occurring Trp at β107 was expressed alone in otherwise Trp-free background (we refer to this as the “βW107” enzyme). After purification, all mutant enzymes showed normal subunit composition on SDS-gels. Properties of the mutant enzymes used in this work are shown in Table I. It may be seen that none of the enzymes containing single Trp residues or the Trp-free enzyme caused any major functional perturbation of ATP synthesis in cells as the growth yields were close to normal. Also, the specific activities of the purified F1 were close to normal (the increased activity for Trp-free F1 confirmed previous data (42Wilke-Mounts S. Weber J. Grell E. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). Yields of the αL55W, βF17W, βY26W, and Trp-free enzyme were 0.04, 0.085, 0.19, and 0.11 mg/g cells, respectively, which was significantly lower than wild-type (0.8 mg/g cells). However, the βW107 enzyme could be purified in good yield (0.41 mg/g cells).Table IProperties of mutant strains and purified F1Strain/mutationGrowth yield1-aGrowth yield (measured as A595) in 3 mM glucose-5% LB mininal medium.F1-ATPase activityF1 fluorescence λmax1-bCorrected spectra.(%)(units/mg)(nm)Wild-type10027331Trp-free1-cContains the mutations δW28L/αW513F/γW108Y/γW206Y/βW107F yielding F1Trp-free (42).10051αL55W1-dTrp-free background.8828330βF17W1-dTrp-free background.9644322βY26W1-dTrp-free background.10130341βW1071-dTrp-free background.10035336δW28L1-eWild-type background.10227NDαG29D/βW1071-dTrp-free background.6519NDUnc−(pUC/DK8)49ND, not determined.1-a Growth yield (measured as A595) in 3 mM glucose-5% LB mininal medium.1-b Corrected spectra.1-c Contains the mutations δW28L/αW513F/γW108Y/γW206Y/βW107F yielding F1Trp-free (42Wilke-Mounts S.

Open table in a new tab ND, not determined. To prepare δ-depleted F1 we used essentially the procedure of Smith et al. (43Smith J.B. Sternweis P.C. Heppel L.A. J. Supramol. Struct. 1975; 2: 248-255Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in which F1 is passed through a gel filtration column at pH 9.4, which causes the δ-subunit to dissociate from the α3β3γε complex. We found that complete δ-depletion was not achieved with wild-type F1. However, complete depletion (as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels) was achieved with the Trp-free enzyme, the mutants αL55W, βF17W, βY26W, and the βW107 enzyme. The result of a δ-depletion experiment using βW107 enzyme is shown in Fig. 1lanes 1 and 2, and was typical for this group. Confirming the earlier report (43Smith J.B. Sternweis P.C. Heppel L.A. J. Supramol. Struct. 1975; 2: 248-255Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) we found that δ-depletion by this procedure did not change the ATPase activity of F1. A common property of all the enzymes that could be efficiently depleted of δ by this procedure was that they contain the mutation δW28L in the δ-subunit. We therefore constructed an enzyme that was wild-type except for the δW28L mutation and found that it too could be readily depleted of δ-subunit. Thus residue δTrp-28 appeared to contribute to enhanced affinity of binding of δ-subunit to F1, and use of the mutant δW28L was valuable for δ-depletion. We used essentially the method reported by Dunn and Chandler (40Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) in which δ-subunit expression from plasmid pJC1 is induced by isopropyl thiogalactoside. Plasmid JC1 was transformed into strains DK8 (ΔuncB-uncC) or AH3(ΔuncFH). Growth conditions and purification of δ were essentially as described (40Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the original procedure a proteolytic fragment named δ′, consisting of residues 1–134 of δ-subunit (27Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 197-201Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was formed and had to be separated from intact δ. Here we found that using the DK8 background, only δ′ was present, and it could be purified to homogeneity readily (Fig. 1, lane 3). In contrast, in the AH3 background, mostly intact δ and little δ′ was present, and the intact δ could be readily purified (Fig. 1, lane 5) in high yield (5.0 mg/liter cells). We also introduced the δW28L mutation, allowing purification of this mutant δ-subunit (Fig. 1, lane 4). The in vitro ATP-driven proton-pumping assay described by Perlin et al. (48Perlin D.S. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9793-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to demonstrate functional integrity of δ-depleted F1 and purified δ. The assay uses acridine orange fluorescence quenching as a measure of proton accumulation in membrane vesicles. Fig. 2A shows typical experimental results. F1 containing the δW28L mutation was depleted of δ, thus yielding wild-type δ-depleted F1. Addition of this preparation to KSCN-stripped membranes gave no ATP-driven proton pumping (Fig. 2A, trace 1). When wild-type F1 that was δ-replete (containing either Trp or Leu at δ28) was added the results were as in Fig. 2A, trace 2, i.e. there was excellent reconstitution of ATP-driven proton pumping. When δ-depleted F1 was preincubated with excess purified δ (containing either Trp or Leu at δ28) the results were as in trace 3, i.e. there was again excellent reconstitution of function. When purified δ′ was substituted for δ, however, no reconstitution of function occurred. Using this method we found that all of the mutant F1preparations containing single Trp and Trp-free F1 gave 50–85% quenching of acridine fluorescence quenching upon rebinding to stripped membranes either before δ-depletion or after δ-depletion followed by incubation with wild-type or δW28L δ-subunit. Therefore all of these mutant enzymes were functionally competent. The experiment also showed that the procedure used for δ-depletion did not cause functional impairment and that our purified δ preparations were fully active. We investigated whether this procedure could be used to determine stoichiometry and/or affinity of binding of δ to δ-depleted F1. Fig. 2B shows a typical titration experiment in which increasing amounts of wild-type δ-subunit were mixed with wild-type δ-depleted F1 and stripped membranes. The curve shows that saturation was reached at a stoichiometry of less than 1 mol of δ per mol of added δ-depleted F1. This result ensues because the Fo binds F1-δ complex preferentially, and the assay requires that F1 is present in excess over Fo. Thus this assay cannot be used to determine accurately the affinity of binding of δ to F1. The environment of the introduced Trp in the mutant enzymes varied from unpolar (βF17W) to moderately polar (βY26W; λmax values given in Table I). Each of the enzymes, αL55W, βF17W, βY26W, and βW107, was δ-depleted and then mixed with purified δW28L δ-subunit (which lacks Trp and therefore has no intrinsic Trp fluorescence of its own as seen in Fig. 3, trace 1). In no case was any change in fluorescence spectrum seen (data not shown). Therefore none of these single Trp residues was responsive to addition of δ-subunit, and it appeared binding of δ caused no changes of the environment of these residues within the N-terminal β-barrel domains of the α- and β-subunits, indicating conformational rigidi"

Nature. 1987; 330: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). By comparison to B-form DNA, the homopolymeric (dA·dT) sequences have a shorter helical repeat (10.0 bp/turn as opposed to 10.5 bp/turn), a narrower minor groove (∼9 Å as compared with ∼15 Å), and additional bifurcated hydrogen bonds that provide added structural stability (7Koch K.A.

Nature. 1987; 330: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The rigidity of these elements resists conforming tightly to the face of the nucleosome, creating localized DNA distortions on either end of the element that provides “access windows” for trans-acting factors (7Koch K.A.

The Nmp4 proteins (Fig. 1A) are the only known Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins that bind to the minor groove of homopolymeric (dA·dT) sites, such as those present in the promoters of many extracellular matrix genes including the type I collagen α1(I) polypeptide chain (COL1A1)1 promoter and several matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) (13Thunyakitpisal P.

The MMP Nmp4 consensus element is embedded within both COL1A1 sites A and B in the reverse orientation (Fig. 1B). Some Nmp4 binding sites in the MMP7promoter contain a stretch of 7–9 As similar to the stretch of 9 Ts in the COL1A1 consensus sequence. In a previous study, we compared the capacities of the Nmp4 isoforms 11H, 13H, 21H, and 28H (GenBankTM accession numbersAF216804, AF216805, AF216806, AF216807, and AB019281, see Fig.1A) to bind to the COL1A1/MMP regulatory sequence (13Thunyakitpisal P.

The Nmp4 isoforms 11H, 13H, and 21H are full-length cDNAs encoding in-frame splice variants containing from 6–8 Cys2His2 zinc fingers. Nmp4/11H and Nmp4/13H have eight zinc fingers, whereas Nmp4/21H has six fingers, missing numbers 4 and 5. Nmp4/28H has only the first five zinc fingers, is lacking the poly(QA) domain and C terminus common to the other isoforms, and has an insert just before the first finger (Fig.1A). Using electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA), the Nmp4 proteins 11H, 13H, and 21H exhibited binding to theCOL1A1/MMP consensus site and yielded binding profiles similar to that obtained with the nuclear matrix fraction from osteoblast-like cells (13Thunyakitpisal P. Alvarez M. Tokunaga K. Onyia J.E. Hock J. Ohashi N. Feister H. Rhodes S.J. Bidwell J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the Nmp4/28H clone did not bind to the consensus element (13Thunyakitpisal P. Alvarez M. Tokunaga K. Onyia J.E. Hock J. Ohashi N. Feister H. Rhodes S.J. Bidwell J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, Nmp4/21H is a native truncated isoform exhibiting COL1A1/MMP DNA binding. Nmp4 proteins have an SH3-binding domain (14Nakamoto T. Yamagata T. Sakai R. Ogawa S. Honda H. Ueno H. Hirano N. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1649-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that overlaps with a putative AT-hook motif (13Thunyakitpisal P. Alvarez M. Tokunaga K. Onyia J.E. Hock J. Ohashi N. Feister H. Rhodes S.J. Bidwell J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), another potential DNA-binding domain (Fig.1A). The AT-hook is characteristic of the High Mobility Group A superfamily of architectural transcription factors and can mediate binding to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA (6Reeves R. Environ.

However, both the SH3-binding and AT-hook domains can mediate protein-protein interactions in the formation of higher order protein complexes in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively (18Chin M.T.

Biol. 1994; 61: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the N-terminal region, Nmp4 proteins also possess a serine-threonine-rich motif (amino acids 51–173), similar to trans-activation domains in immunoglobulin transcription factor-1, immunoglobulin transcription factor-2, and Pax6 (21Seipel K. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 22Tang H.K. Singh S. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7210-7221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Additionally, the Nmp4 isoforms include a poly(Q) motif encoded by a CAG trinucleotide repeat and a poly(QA) repeat (13Thunyakitpisal P. Alvarez M. Tokunaga K. Onyia J.E. Hock J. Ohashi N. Feister H.

Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1649-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Both of these motifs have been shown to influence the transcriptional activity of other keytrans-acting proteins including Cbfa1/Osf2, CA150, and the human androgen receptors (23Beilin J. Ball E.M. Favaloro J.M. Zajac J.D. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 24Suñé C. Hayashi T. Liu Y. Lane W.S. Young R.A. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, our objective was to identify the DNA-binding and trans-activation domains of the Nmp4 proteins. We observed that only three specific zinc fingers (2, 3, and 6 of isoform 21H) were required for binding to the homopolymeric (dA·dT) COL1A1/MMP Nmp4 consensus element.Trans-activation experiments revealed a sensitivity of specific transcriptional regulatory domains to their attached DBD or to their DNA-binding state consistent with the apparent multiple functions of the proteins themselves. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) low glucose medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 μg/ml amphotericin, 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). The rat osteosarcoma cells UMR 106-01, a generous gift from Dr. Nicola Partridge (St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO) were grown as described previously (15Alvarez M. Thunyakitpisal P. Morrison P. Onyia J. Hock J. Bidwell J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 336-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in humidified 95% air/5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cDNAs of the wild-type Nmp4 isoforms 11H, 13H, 21H, and 28H were subcloned into pcDNA-3TM (Invitrogen) as described previously (13Thunyakitpisal P. Alvarez M. Tokunaga K. Onyia J.E. Hock J. Ohashi N. Feister H. Rhodes S.J. Bidwell J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The deletions from N- or C-terminal were generated by cloning the PCR products of truncated 11H or 21H clones into pcDNA-3TM vectors. The internal deletions were prepared using ExSiteTM PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The integrity of all plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. The Nmp4 pcDNA-3 constructs were expressed in vitro using the TNT® Quick-coupled transcription/translation system following the manufacturers’ instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The molecular weights of the protein products were confirmed by Western analysis. Protein-DNA interactions were characterized using EMSA as described previously (15Alvarez M. Thunyakitpisal P. Morrison P. Onyia J. Hock J. Bidwell J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 336-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 20-μl binding reactions included 75 mm KCl, 15% glycerol, 0.15 mm EDTA, 500 ng of poly(dI·dC), 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 19 mmHepes (pH 7.5), 0.0075% Nonidet P-40, 2–4 μl of TNT lysate protein or 2 μg of nuclear matrix protein, and 0.5 nm end-labeled rat COL1A1 5′-regulatory fragment (site A = −3489/−3434 nt and site B = −1594/−1541 (15Alvarez M. Thunyakitpisal P. Morrison P. Onyia J. Hock J. Bidwell J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 336-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) as the probe. These fragments also serve as Nmp4-MMP binding sites, because the only difference is the orientation of the homopolymeric sequence within the promoters (13, 14, also see Fig. 1B). The rat COL1A1 5′-regulatory region (−3518/+115 nt) was a generous gift from A. Lichtler, B. Kream, and D. Rowe (The University of Connecticut Health Center, Framington, CT). We used Western blot analysis to relatively quantify the amount of each protein in thein vitro transcription translation lysate. The volume of the lysate used in the EMSA (2–4 μl) was based on the data from the Western analysis. Distamycin A hydrochloride and methyl green (Sigma) were prepared as aqueous stock solutions (10 mm). These compounds were added to some of the EMSA-binding reactions and incubated for 25–30 min at room temperature prior to electrophoresis, which was performed on 8% polyacrylamide gels (80:1 acrylamide,N,N′-methylbisacrylamide) in 1 × Tris/glycine EDTA buffer (4 °C). For DMS interference fingerprinting analysis (26Shaw P.E. Stewart A.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 221-227PubMed Google Scholar, 27He X. Hohn T. Futterer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11799-11808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the ratCOL1A1 5′-regulatory region containing site A (−3518/−3406 nt) was singly end-labeled at either the 5′ or 3′ end. This DNA was then partially methylated by adding 2 μl of dimethyl sulfate (Sigma) for 1 min in 200 μl of reaction buffer (60 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA). Methylation was stopped with the addition of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 7.0), and 200 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol, washed, lyophilized, and resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer. The partially methylated DNA was used as a probe in EMSA with the in vitrotranslated Nmp4/11H and Nmp4/21H proteins as described above. The protein-DNA complexes and unbound probe were excised and eluted from the gel. The bound proteins were removed by extraction with phenol-chloroform, and the DNA was purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA) followed by ethanol precipitation. To cleave the modified A and G residues, the DNA pellet was resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8)/1 mm EDTA and incubated for 15 min at 92 °C followed by the addition of 100 mm NaOH and incubated for another 30 min at 92 °C. The DNA was then ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer; equal counts were lyophilized, dissolved in formamide gel-loading dye, and resolved in a 8% sequencing gel. The EMSA and DMS interference gels were dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h and then at room temperature for 30 min. Kodak XAR film was exposed to the gel with an intensifying screen overnight at −80 °C. GAL4 fusion constructs of full-length and truncated derivatives of Nmp4/21H were obtained by ligating the PCR-generated coding sequences downstream and in frame with a sequence coding for the GAL4-DNA-binding domain (GAL4-DBD, amino acids 1–147) in the pBind vector (Checkmate Mammalian two-hybrid system, Promega). The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion, and their expression was confirmed by Western analysis. For analysis of activation domains, pFRluc vector (Stratagene) containing five copies of the GAL4 binding element and a basic promoter element (TATA box) upstream of a luciferase gene was used as a reporter. GAL4 fusion constructs and pFRluc reporter were used in 1:2 microgram ratio for transient transfection in 293T cells. The human kidney 293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 1.0–1.5 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h, the cells in each well were transiently transfected with DNA using the CalPhos system (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The transfected cells were harvested with the reporter lysis buffer (Promega) 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO47H2O, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.1)) and then exposed to lysis buffer for 15 min at room temperature. The lysates were processed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturers’ instructions (Promega) by adding 100 μl of Bright-GloTMreagent to 100 μl of cell lysate and reading immediately on a Packard bioscience fusion luminometer (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). Total protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Blue Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce). Results for the luciferase assay were reported as relative light units per microgram of total protein. The human MMP7 promoter (−2300/+30 nt) kindly provided by Dr. Lynn Matrisian (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) was subcloned into the pGL-3 Basic (Promega) using BamHI andXhoI. The sequence fidelity of the MMP7/pGL-3 construct was verified by restriction digests. To assay MMP7activation, the Nmp4/21H or its deletion constructs in the pcDNA-3 expression vector and the MMP7 reporter construct were used in a 1:2 microgram ratio for transient transfection in 293T cells. The luciferase assay was then performed as described above. Nuclear matrix proteins were extracted from UMR 106-01 cells using a sequential extraction protocol as described previously (28Alvarez M. Onyia J. Hock J. Xu H. Long W. Bidwell J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the differences among groups with a predeterminedp value of <0.05 to achieve statistical significance. Tukey’s test for post hoc comparison was applied based on the ANOVA results. The truncated Nmp4/28H isoform has an insert before the first zinc finger (Fig.1A). Removal of this insert failed to confer DNA binding to this isoform (data not shown). Therefore, we used Nmp4/21H to characterize the minimum Nmp4-COL1A1/MMP DNA-binding domain, because it is the shortest naturally occurring isoform that binds to these regulatory sites (13Thunyakitpisal P. Alvarez M. Tokunaga K. Onyia J.E. Hock J. Ohashi N. Feister H. Rhodes S.J. Bidwell J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Nakamoto T. Yamagata T. Sakai R. Ogawa S. Honda H. Ueno H. Hirano N. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1649-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Wild-type Nmp4/21H and derivatives were subcloned into pcDNA-3, expressed in vitro, and characterized by EMSA using the COL1A1 site A as the probe (13Thunyakitpisal P. Alvarez M. Tokunaga K. Onyia J.E. Hock J. Ohashi N. Feister H. Rhodes S.J. Bidwell J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The full-length Nmp4/21H isoform is comprised of 518 amino acids (aa), which include zinc fingers 1–3 and 6–8 (Fig.2A, construct 1). The deletion of the C-terminal region (construct 2), the poly(QA) domain (construct 3), or the AT-hook/SH3-binding domain (construct 7) did not abrogate DNA binding to theCOL1A1/MMP consensus sequence (Fig. 2,A and B). The removal of larger regions of the Nmp4/21H protein including the N terminus (construct 5) and the C terminus plus the poly(QA) repeat (construct 4) had no impact on DNA binding as determined by EMSA (Fig. 2, A andB). Deletion of the Cys2His2 zinc fingers from Nmp4/21H (construct 8) abrogated DNA binding (Fig. 2,A and B). Conversely, this domain alone (construct 9) exhibited binding to the consensus sequence (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine whether any specific zinc fingers conferred DNA binding to theCOL1A1/MMP binding site, we deleted different combinations of three, two, or single zinc fingers. We found that zinc fingers 1, 7, and 8 are not required, whereas the combination of zinc fingers 2, 3, and 6 were necessary for mediating Nmp4/21H binding to theCOL1A1/MMP consensus elements. Identical results were obtained using COL1A1 site B (data not shown). Nmp4/28H is missing zinc finger 6, which would explain its inability to bind to theCOL1A1/MMP consensus element (13Thunyakitpisal P. Alvarez M. Tokunaga K. Onyia J.E. Hock J. Ohashi N. Feister H. Rhodes S.J. Bidwell J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Cys2His2 zinc fingers alone mediated binding to the minor groove of the AT-rich Nmp4 consensus sequence, we used EMSA in combination with distamycin and methyl green. Distamycin is used as a competitor for protein binding to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA (29Abu-Daya A. Fox K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4962-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and methyl green competes for the occupation of the major groove of DNA (30Kim S.K. Norden B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The binding of the full-length construct of Nmp4/21H to site A of the COL1A1promoter was sensitive to the presence of distamycin (Fig.3A) as demonstrated previously (13Thunyakitpisal P. Alvarez M. Tokunaga K. Onyia J.E. Hock J. Ohashi N. Feister H. Rhodes S.J. Bidwell J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Alvarez M. Thunyakitpisal P. Morrison P. Onyia J. Hock J. Bidwell J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 336-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The deletion of the AT-hook/SH3-binding domain (construct 7) did not alter the effect of distamycin on Nmp4/21H-COL1A1 binding (Fig. 3A). The zinc finger domain alone (construct 9) exhibited the same sensitivity to distamycin as the full-length protein (Fig.3A). Interestingly, the full-length Nmp4/21H construct exhibited a weak sensitivity to the same concentrations of methyl green (Fig. 3B), yet this sensitivity was attenuated upon removal of the putative AT-hook/SH3-binding domain. Finally, DNA binding by the zinc finger domain alone showed no sensitivity to the presence of methyl green (Fig. 3B). In a previous study, we used methidium-propyl EDTA footprinting to demarcate the perimeter of the nuclear matrix extract binding activity along site A of the COL1A1 5′-regulatory region (15Alvarez M. Thunyakitpisal P. Morrison P. Onyia J. Hock J. Bidwell J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 336-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we used DMS interference fingerprinting to further delimit the Nmp4 protein-DNA contacts and to compare Nmp4/11H and Nmp4/21H association with this consensus element (Fig. 4). The Nmp4/11H isoform contains eight zinc fingers, whereas the Nmp4/21H has six. Both the Nmp4/11H and Nmp4/21H fingerprints extended across nucleotides −3463/−3458 (Fig. 4), consistent with the methidium-propyl EDTA footprint of the nuclear matrix extract obtained in our earlier study (15Alvarez M. Thunyakitpisal P. Morrison P. Onyia J. Hock J. Bidwell J.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 336-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The sequence of the opposing strand in the area of the Nmp4 binding site contains only Cs and Ts and therefore was not suitable for methylation interference analysis (data not shown). We used Nmp4-GAL4-DBD chimeras consisting of either the full-length Nmp4/21H protein or its truncated derivatives fused to the GAL4-DBD to identify domains exhibiting autonomous trans-activation capacity. This was accomplished by co-transfecting 293T cells with the chimeras and a reporter construct driven by a basic promoter linked to five copies of the GAL 4 consensus sequence (see “Materials and Methods”). The N terminus (1–187 aa) of Nmp4/21H exhibited strongtrans-activation capacity and increased promoter activity 20–30-fold over base-line promoter activity (Fig.5). The poly(QA) (396–453 aa) motif lacked trans-activation activity, but in combination with the C terminus, (396–518 aa) showed a weak trans-activation capacity increasing promoter activity ∼2-fold over base line (Fig.5). Interestingly, the strong trans-activation activity of the N terminus was completely masked within the context of the full-length Nmp4/21H-GAL4-DBD chimera (Fig. 5). In fact, the full-length Nmp4-GAL4-DBD chimera (1–518 aa) and the zinc finger-GAL4-DBD chimera (231–395 aa) repressed promoter activity 5- and 9-fold below base line, respectively (Fig. 5). The portion of the Nmp4 protein (188–230 aa) that includes the AT-hook/SH3-binding domain significantly attenuated the strong trans-activation capacity of the N terminus (1–187 aa) but did not completely inhibit it (2.1-fold over base line), suggesting that the zinc finger domain contributed to this masking effect (Fig. 5). Promoter-reporter constructs lacking the GAL4 DNA binding sites did not respond to the various Nmp4/21H-GAL4-DBD chimeric constructs (data not shown), indicating the absence of background effects caused by the zinc finger-containing constructs targeting other sites. To determine whether the Nmp4/21H regulatory domains behave as autonomous modules or instead are sensitive to the identity of their attached DBD or to their DNA binding state, we removed the GAL4-DBD. Kidney 293T cells were co-transfected with a human MMP7 promoter-reporter construct containing the homopolymeric (dA·dT) Nmp4 consensus sequence and an expression vector containing either the full-length Nmp4/21H isoform or one of its truncated derivatives. Full-length Nmp4/21H isoform (1–518 aa) up-regulated the basal activity of the MMP7/luciferase promoter-report"
https://openalex.org/W1995127502,"Expression of allograft inflammatory factor-1 (Aif-1), a 17-kDa protein bearing an EF-hand Ca2+ binding motif, increases markedly in monocytes and macrophages participating in allo- and autoimmune reactions, including the perivascular inflammation in transplanted hearts, microglial infiltrates in experimental autoimmune neuritis, and the inflamed pancreas of prediabetic BB rats. To investigate the mechanism of this regulation, we isolated the mouse aif-1 gene and determined its genomic organization. The gene has six exons distributed over 1.6 kilobases, an interferon γ-inducible DNase I-hypersensitive site near −900, and flanking sequences on either side predicted to associate with nuclear matrix. Reporter gene analyses identified sequences between −902 and −789, including consensus Ets and interferon regulatory factor elements, required for macrophage-specific and interferon γ-inducible transcriptional activity. Pu.1 bound to the Ets site in electromobility shift assay and forced expression of Pu.1 activated the aif-1 promoter in 3T3 fibroblasts, in which it is normally inactive. However, the transcriptional activity of a concatamer of the Ets site alone did not increase with interferon γ treatment. Cooperation between Pu.1 and proteins binding to the interferon regulatory factor element appears to be necessary for both macrophage-specific and interferon γ-inducible expression of theaif-1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2083168128,"Despite being widely hypothesized, the actual contribution of choline as a methyl source for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methylation has never been demonstrated, mainly due to the inability of conventional methods to distinguish the products from that of the CDP-choline pathway. Using a novel combination of stable-isotope labeling and tandem mass spectrometry, we demonstrated for the first time that choline contributed to phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis both as an intact choline moiety via the CDP-choline pathway and as a methyl donor via PE methylation pathway. When hepatocytes were labeled with d 9-choline containing three deuterium atoms on each of the three methyl groups, d 3-PC and d 6-PC were detected, indicating that newly synthesized PC contained one or more individually mobilized methyl groups from d 9-choline. The synthesis ofd 3-PC and d 6-PC was sensitive to the general methylation inhibitor 3-deazaadenosine and were specific products of PE methylation using choline as a one-carbon donor. While the contribution to the CDP-choline pathway remained intact in hepatocarcinoma cells, contribution of choline to PE methylation was completely disrupted. In addition to a previously identified lack of PE methyltransferase, hepatocarcinoma cells were found to lack the abilities to oxidize choline to betaine and to donate the methyl group from betaine to homocysteine, whereas the usage of exogenous methionine as a methyl group donor was normal. The failure to use choline as a methyl source in hepatocarcinoma cells may contribute to methionine dependence, a widely observed aberration of one-carbon metabolism in malignancy. Despite being widely hypothesized, the actual contribution of choline as a methyl source for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methylation has never been demonstrated, mainly due to the inability of conventional methods to distinguish the products from that of the CDP-choline pathway. Using a novel combination of stable-isotope labeling and tandem mass spectrometry, we demonstrated for the first time that choline contributed to phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis both as an intact choline moiety via the CDP-choline pathway and as a methyl donor via PE methylation pathway. When hepatocytes were labeled with d 9-choline containing three deuterium atoms on each of the three methyl groups, d 3-PC and d 6-PC were detected, indicating that newly synthesized PC contained one or more individually mobilized methyl groups from d 9-choline. The synthesis ofd 3-PC and d 6-PC was sensitive to the general methylation inhibitor 3-deazaadenosine and were specific products of PE methylation using choline as a one-carbon donor. While the contribution to the CDP-choline pathway remained intact in hepatocarcinoma cells, contribution of choline to PE methylation was completely disrupted. In addition to a previously identified lack of PE methyltransferase, hepatocarcinoma cells were found to lack the abilities to oxidize choline to betaine and to donate the methyl group from betaine to homocysteine, whereas the usage of exogenous methionine as a methyl group donor was normal.

The CDP-choline pathway is catalyzed sequentially by three enzymatic activities present in all mammalian cells: choline kinase, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, and cholinephosphotransferase (1.Vance D.E.

The PE methylation pathway is catalyzed by PEMT1 and PEMT2, two distinct hepatic PE methyltransferases that catalyze identical reactions but differ in structure and cellular localization (3.Cui Z.

The CDP-choline pathway uses exogenous choline as the initial substrate and generates a pool of PC that is comprised primarily of short chain (16/18 carbons and 18/18 carbons), saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (4.DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The PE methylation pathway on the other hand synthesizes a pool of PC predominantly with long chain (18/20 carbons and 18/22 carbons), polyunsaturated fatty acids (4.DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The two pathways also have opposite roles in liver growth and hepatocyte proliferation. Liver growth and liver carcinogenesis are associated with activation of the CDP-choline pathway (5.Cui Z.

Increased activity of PE methylation specifically and quantitatively inhibits cellular division of hepatoma cells (8.Cui Z. Houweling M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24531-24533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of PEMT via gene knockout is not lethal when choline is present in the diet, but is lethal when choline is absent from the diet (9.Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B.

During long-term choline deficiency, rat liver PEMT is activated by 5-fold and becomes an essential enzyme to generate the choline moiety endogenously (10.Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

PEMT uses the general methyl donorS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in three sequential transmethylation reactions (11.Walkey C.J. Yu L. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27043-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). AdoMet is derived from methionine that can be obtained either from extracellular sources or by intracellular methylation of homocysteine. Choline, as a precursor to betaine, is a methyl source for the methylation of homocysteine (see Fig. 1). In the liver, choline is converted to betaine via oxidation steps in the mitochondria by choline dehydrogenase (CDH) (12.Kramar R. Kremsen K. Raab R. Hoppe Seylers Z. Physiol. Chem. 1984; 365: 1207-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 13.Zhang J. Blusztajn J.K. Zeisel S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) (14.Chern M.K. Pietruszko R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A methyl group of betaine is transferred to homocysteine by betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) to generate methionine. Methionine is converted to AdoMet by methionine adenosyltransferase. The liver converts over 60% of free choline into betaine (15.Ishidate K. Vance D.E. Phosphatidylcholine Metabolism. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 9-32Google Scholar), suggesting that choline may play a significant role in methylation reactions. However, an actual contribution of choline to PE methylation has not been demonstrated. This is mainly because many studies of choline metabolism have used choline that contains radioactive methyl groups. Using this radiolabeling technique, the two pools of choline-derived PC, one from the CDP-choline pathway containing the entire choline molecule, and the other from the methylation of PE containing only the methyl groups of choline, could not be distinguished from one another. In this paper, we use tandem mass spectrometry to identify specific choline-derived PC pools synthesized by the PE methylation pathway, using choline containing deuterium-labeled methyl groups as a methyl donor. We also describe evidence for the inactivation of this hepatic choline one-carbon donor pathway in hepatocarcinoma cells. d 9-Choline chloride,d 4-ethanolamine, andd 9-betaine were purchased from Isotec, Inc.d 3-Methionine was purchased from Medical Isotopes, Inc.

Phospholipid standards were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. All other chemicals and materials were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Rat primary hepatocytes were isolated by a collagenase perfusion procedure (16.Davis R.A. Engelhorn S.C. Pangburn S.H. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2010-2016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated culture dishes overnight in DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml insulin. Experiments with hepatocytes were started after overnight culture. Stable McArdle RH7777/PEMT2 cells were established by co-transfection with 10 μg of pCMV5/PEMT2 and 1 μg of pSV2neo plasmids via calcium phosphate precipitation and selected by G-418 as described previously (8.Cui Z. Houweling M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24531-24533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were done in serum-, choline-, ethanolamine-, and methionine-free DMEM containing 10 μg/ml insulin, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μm folate, and 400 μm serine. Cells (3.5 × 105) were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 500 μm unlabeled or deuterium-labeled choline, betaine, methionine, and/or ethanolamine, as described under “Results” and in the figure legends. Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into ice-cold water/methanol, and the lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (17.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42377) Google Scholar) with 0.3% acetic acid. The lipid extracts were stored in methylene chloride at −80 °C. Prior to mass spectrometry, the solvent was dried under nitrogen and the lipid extracts were dissolved in 45/45/10 methylene chloride/methanol/water. The aqueous portions of the Bligh and Dyer extracts were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Experiments were repeated three times with hepatocytes and twice with McArdle-RH7777 cells with identical results. Figures containing mass spectrometric histograms show representative results. Lipid extracts were analyzed on a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, United Kingdom). Data were acquired using MassLynx NT software (Micromass Limited). Standards and samples contained 1% formic acid for positive ion analysis. All analyses were performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, argon pressure of 1.8 × 10−3 mBar, and source temperature of 200 °C. PC species were detected by a precursor ion scan at collision energy of 25 eV for molecules generating the daughter ion of m/z 184, 187, 188, 190, 191, 193, 194, or 197, depending on the number of deuterium atoms within the head group. The intensities of equimolar PC standards decrease significantly as mass increases (35.DeLong C.J. Baker P.R. Samuel M. Cui Z. Thomas M.J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1959-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A standard curve from equimolar PC standards was used to derive an equation to correct raw results for mass discrimination: y′ = y(sm +b)/(xm + b). (y′ = corrected intensity of each sample peak, y = actual intensity of each sample peak, s =m/z value of di-14:0 PC standard,m = slope derived from PC standard curve,b = y-intercept derived from PC standard curve, and × = m/z value of each sample peak.) Histograms of d 10-PC were further processed by subtracting out the peak intensities due to isotopic carryover ofd 9-PC (∼8% of d 9-PC). All histograms are displayed as relative intensity to the highest peak. In histograms with no significant peaks (defined as 3 times greater than background), the relative intensity is adjusted to display background at ∼10%. Hepatocytes (3.5 × 105 cells) were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm DZA in regular DMEM containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]ethanolamine. The extracted lipid was applied onto Silica Gel H TLC plates and run in a solvent system of 65/35/8 methylene chloride/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (v/v). Bands were visualized by iodine vapor and those that corresponded to PC and PE standards were scraped into scintillation vials containing 200 μl of MeOH, vortexed, and 3 ml of scintillation fluid was added. Radioactivity was counted on a Beckman LS 5000CE liquid scintillation counter. In 4 parallel experiments, hepatocytes were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm DZA in serum-free medium containing 500 μm of each component choline, betaine, methionine, and ethanolamine, with each experiment having one deuterium-labeled component and the other three unlabeled components. The lipid extracts were analyzed by ESI-MS/MS as described above. The fatty acid composition of individual molecular species was determined in the negative ion mode by daughter ion analysis of the [M-CH3]− ions of PC in a total lipid extract from unlabeled cells. The fatty acid composition of [M-CH3]− ions of PC that overlapped with the [M-H]− ions of PE or PS in the total lipid extract were verified by daughter ion analysis of high performance liquid chromatography-separated hepatocyte PC (18.Rampersaud G.C. Kauwell G.P. Hutson A.D. Cerda J.J. Bailey L.B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 72: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Daughter ion analysis was performed at collision energy of 25 eV. For the detection of choline and betaine, the aqueous portion of the Bligh and Dyer (17.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42377) Google Scholar) extract from 3.5 × 105 cells containing 1% formic acid was analyzed directly by ESI-MS in the positive ion mode at a cone voltage of 35 eV. Hepatocytes and RH7777 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 500 μm choline, methionine, and serine for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and trypsinized. The cell pellet was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and DNA was extracted using the genomic DNA extraction kit from Promega. The DNA concentration was measured on a Beckman DU7500 spectrophotometer. The 260 nm/280 nm ratio for all samples was at least 1.7. Extent of DNA methylation was measured using the DNA methylation assay described by Rampersaudet al. (18.Rampersaud G.C. Kauwell G.P. Hutson A.D. Cerda J.J. Bailey L.B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 72: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). DNA (0.5 μg) was incubated with 2 units of Sss1 methylase (New England Biolabs), 1 × Sss1 methylase buffer, and 3 μCi of [3H]adenosylmethionine for 1 h at 30 °C. Then 15 μl of the assay was loaded onto a DE81 ion exchange filter and washed successively with 0.5 m phosphate buffer, 70% ethanol, and 100% ethanol. The filter was dried and placed in a scintillation vial with 3 ml of scintillation fluid and counted with a Beckman LS 5000CE liquid scintillation counter. Incorporation of3H-methyl groups was inversely proportional to the level of DNA methylation. Rat hepatocytes and rat RH7777 hepatoma cells were homogenized with a Branson Sonifier 250 in buffer composed of 0.9 mm CaCl2, 2.7 mmKCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 1.7 mmNaCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenized samples were centrifuged at 325 × g for 5 min to clear the protein of cell debris. The protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction mixtures for enzymatic assays contained 40 mm glycine (pH 8.5), 130 μm d 9-choline, 50 μg of protein extracts, and homogenization buffer to a final volume of 100 μl and were incubated at 37 °C. At desired time points, 10 μl of 1.2 m HCl was added to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixtures were extracted by adding 1 volume of methanol and 2 volumes of chloroform, vortexed, and centrifuged at 117.5 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was collected and formic acid was added for a final concentration of 2% to facilitate analysis. The resulting samples were immediately analyzed on a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass). Data were acquired using MassLynx NT software (Micromass). All analyses were performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, argon pressure of 1.9 × 10−3mBar, and source temperature of 200 °C. Parameters for detection ofd 9-choline and d 9-betaine were first optimized using standards. d 9-Choline was identified by precursor ion scan at collision energy of 20 eV for molecules generating a daughter ion of m/z 45.d 9-Betaine was identified by precursor ion scan at collision energy of 18 eV for molecules generating a daughter ion ofm/z 68. The concentrations ofd 9-choline and d 9-betaine in each sample were determined by comparing the intensity at each time point with a standard of known concentration. Reaction mixtures containing 50 μg of protein isolated from RH7777 cells or hepatoma cells as described above with 5 mm homocysteine, 2 mm d 9-betaine, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and homogenization buffer to a final volume of 100 μl were incubated at 37 °C. At desired time points, trichloroacetic acid was added at a final concentration of 5% to terminate the reaction. The samples were centrifuged at 13,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and immediately analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. All analyses were performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, argon pressure of 1.9 × 10−3 mBar, and source temperature of 200 °C. Parameters for detection ofd 9-betaine andd 3-methionine were first optimized using standards. d 9-betaine was identified by precursor ion scan at collision energy of 18 eV for molecules generating a daughter ion of m/z 68.d 3 -Methionine was detected by precursor ion scan at collision energy of 22 eV for molecules generating a daughter ion of m/z 56. The concentrations of d 9-betaine andd 3-methionine in each sample were determined by comparing the intensity at each time point with a standard of known concentration. To identify the specific products of PE methylation using methyl groups of choline, a labeling strategy was devised to distinguish them from those derived via the CDP-choline pathway. All three methyl groups of choline were expected to be incorporated into PC simultaneously as a whole unit via the CDP-choline pathway. PE methylation, on the other hand, incorporates one methyl group at a time to form PC. If choline is indeed used as a methyl group donor, we expected to detect PC with one deuterated-methyl group (d 3-PC) or two deuterated-methyl groups (d 6-PC) when hepatocytes were labeled with d 9-choline containing three deuterated methyl groups (HO-CH2-CH2-N⊕[CD3]3). To exclude the possibility of d 3-choline andd 6-choline as contaminants, the purity of thed 9-choline solution was verified by ESI-MS/MS to be 98.7% (result not shown). Rat hepatocytes were incubated with 500 μm d 9-choline for 24 h in serum-free DMEM under standard cell culture conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Labeled cells were harvested and total cellular lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (17.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42377) Google Scholar). The newly synthesized PC via the CDP-choline pathway was detected in the positive ion mode by a precursor scan form/z 193, the phosphocholine head group containing 9 deuterium atoms (d 9-PC) (Fig. 2 A).d 3-PC and d 6-PC were detected by precursor scans for m/z 187 and 190, respectively. After 24 h labeling withd 9-choline, a significant amount ofd 3-PC and d 6-PC was detected (Fig. 2 A). The profiles ofd 3-PC species and d 6-PC species were similar to each other and to that of previously reported species from the PE methylation pathway (4.DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The peaks correspond to the molecular species listed by peak number in Table I as determined by ESI-MS/MS daughter ion analysis of hepatocyte PC. The d 3-PC andd 6-PC pools of PC were not detected in unlabeled hepatocytes (results not shown).Table IPC molecular species chart for Fig. 2, 3, and 5Peak numberMolecular species116:0–16:1216:0–16:0316:0–18:2416:0–18:1516:0–20:418:2–18:2618:1–18:216:0–20:3718:0–18:2816:0–22:618:2–20:4918:1–20:416:0–22:51018:0–20:418:1–20:31118:0–22:6 Open table in a new tab To verify if thed 3-PC and d 6-PC were indeed derived via PE methylation, we designed three additional experiments. The first experiment was to determine whether the presence of d 3-PC and d 6-PC were PEMT-dependent, and not due to free exchange of hydrogen and deuterium. We chose a well defined hepatocarcinoma cell line, McA-RH7777, in which PEMT is deficient (19.Cui Z. Houweling M. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of PEMT was demonstrated by incubating the cells in serum-free DMEM containing 500 μm d 4-ethanolamine (HO-CD2-CD2-NH2), 500 μm choline, 200 μm methionine, 20 μm folate, and 400 μm serine. Both the hepatocytes and RH7777 cells utilizedd 4-ethanolamine for PE synthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway and produced d 4-PE (results not shown). In hepatocytes, the conversion ofd 4-PE to d 4-PC confirmed the presence of the PE methylation pathway (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, d 4-PC was not detected in RH7777 cells, which confirmed the absence of PEMT in these cells (Fig. 2 B). The cells were then labeled in the same medium described above, but with d 9-choline and unlabeled ethanolamine. The presence of d 3-PC and d 6-PC were detected in the hepatocytes with active PEMT but not in the PEMT-deficient hepatoma cells (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that these deuterated PC pools were produced specifically by PE methylation. The second experiment was to detect pools of PC that contained deuterium atoms derived from bothd 4-ethanolamine andd 9-choline. The pools of PC from this dual labeling strategy would contain 7, 10, and 13 deuterium atoms. These pools could only be possible if d 4-PE were methylated with one, two, or three d 3-methyl groups from d 9-choline and the remaining methyl groups were from an unlabeled donor. Similar to other labeling experiments, d 7, d 10, andd 13-PC were detected in hepatocytes but not in RH7777 cells (Fig. 2 C). The ability to detectd 13-PC indicated the use of choline-derived methyl groups for all 3 PE methylation reactions. The third experiment was to determine whether PE methylation from a choline-derived methyl group was sensitive to methylation inhibition by DZA which is an inhibitor of S-AdoHyc hydrolase and causes an increase in AdoHyc and 3-deaza-AdoHyc (20.Chiang P.K. Cantoni G.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1979; 28: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and inhibition of PEMT (21.Pritchard P.H. Chiang P.K. Cantoni G.L. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6362-6367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effectiveness of PEMT inhibition was confirmed by incubating hepatocytes with [3H]ethanolamine with and without 10 μm DZA for 24 h. The radioactivity in the PC fraction isolated by TLC was measured. There was a 94% decrease in [3H]PC synthesis in the presence of DZA (Fig. 3). When labeled withd 9-choline andd 4-ethanolamine, the choline-specific PE methylation (d 7-PC andd 10-PC) was similarly inhibited in hepatocytes treated with DZA (Fig. 3). The detection ofd 13-PC was too low to obtain reliable numbers. The inhibition results were further confirmed by the similar level of DZA inhibition of d 4-PC andd 3-PC synthesis fromd 4-ethanolamine andd 9-betaine, respectively, in parallel experiments (results not shown). d 9-PC, which was synthesized by the CDP-choline pathway, actually increased 160%, demonstrating that DZA specifically inhibited PE methylation and not the CDP-choline pathway. Taken together, all three labeling strategies in PEMT-defined cells pointed to the conclusion that choline was indeed used as a source of methyl groups for PE methylation. The PEMT dependence of choline-derived PE methylation led to the hypothesis that the inability to formd 3-PC and d 6-PC could be corrected if PEMT was restored in the hepatoma cells. To test this hypothesis, we expressed PEMT from a full-length cDNA for rat liver PEMT2 in the RH7777 cells and established a stable cell line. The presence of PEMT was confirmed by Western blot analysis (4.DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of PEMT was confirmed by incorporation ofd 4-ethanolamine into PC (Fig. 4 A). Incorporation ofd 3-methionine into PC in the RH7777/PEMT2 cells (Fig. 4 B) suggested that methionine adenosyltransferase was active in these cells. However, restoration of PEMT in hepatoma cells failed to incorporate methyl groups fromd 9-betaine or d 9-choline into PC via methylation (Fig. 4, C and D). The synthesis of d 9-PC in all three cell populations (Fig. 4 D) from d 9-choline was primarily due to the CDP-choline pathway. Failure to incorporated 9-betaine methyl groups into PC in RH7777/PEMT2 cells suggested that BHMT and perhaps other upstream steps of the pathway for choline methylation are defective in the hepatoma cells. To address such a possibility, we used ESI-MS/MS to measure the presence of choline, d 9-choline, betaine, andd 9-betaine directly in the aqueous phase of the Bligh and Dyer extracts. This strategy offered a direct measurement for all four compounds simultaneously. In unlabeled hepatocytes, the level of betaine was three times as high as that of choline (Fig. 5 B, black line, and Fig. 5 D). This ratio between choline and betaine is consistent with a previous report that the majority, over 60%, of free choline in the liver is converted to betaine (15.Ishidate K. Vance D.E.

When hepatocytes were labeled with d 9-choline in the absence of unlabeled choline, a similar ratio between d 9-choline andd 9-betaine was observed (Fig. 5 B, red line). A complete absence of unlabeled betaine when choline was deficient (in the d 9-choline-labeled cells) shows that oxidation of choline is the sole source for betaine in the hepatocytes. In contrast to hepatocytes, hepatoma cells did not have a significant level of betaine above background; neither choline nord 9-choline was oxidized to its product, betaine or d 9-betaine, respectively (Fig. 5 C). Newly designed mass spectrometry-based assays for CDH, BADH, and BHMT activities were used to further characterize the choline methyl donation pathways in hepatocytes versus hepa"
https://openalex.org/W2089756631,"The arrival of high resolution crystal structures for the ribosomal subunits opens a new phase of molecular analysis and asks for corresponding analyses of ribosomal function. Here we apply the phosphorothioate technique to dissect tRNA interactions with the ribosome. We demonstrate that a tRNA bound to the P site of non-programmed 70 S ribosomes contacts predominantly the 50 S, as opposed to the 30 S subunit, indicating that codon-anticodon interaction at the P site is a prerequisite for 30 S binding. Protection patterns of tRNAs bound to isolated subunits and programmed 70 S ribosomes were compared. The results suggest the presence of a movable domain in the large ribosomal subunit that carries tRNA and reveal that only approximately 15% of a tRNA, namely residues 30 +/- 1 to 43 +/- 1, contact the 30 S subunit of programmed 70 S ribosomes, whereas the remaining 85% make contact with the 50 S subunit. Identical protection patterns of two distinct elongator tRNAs at the P site were identified as tRNA species-independent phosphate backbone contacts. The sites of protection correlate nicely with the predicted ribosomal-tRNA contacts deduced from a 5.5-A crystal structure of a programmed 70 S ribosome, thus refining which ribosomal components are critical for tRNA fixation at the P site."
https://openalex.org/W2146575840,"The cloning, purification, and biophysical characterization of the first eukaryotic cold shock protein homologue, Cla h 8, expressed as single functional polypeptide is reported here. It was discovered as a minor allergen of the mold Cladosporium herbarum by phage display using a library selectively enriched for IgE-binding proteins. Based on the sequence homology of Cla h 8 with bacterial cold shock proteins (CSPs), a homology-based computer model of the allergen was computed indicating an all-β structure of Cla h 8. This major structural feature was confirmed by CD spectroscopy. Despite the structural similarities with bacterial CSPs, the DNA-binding and unfolding behavior of Cla h 8 exhibited unique and previously undescribed characteristics. High affinities of Cla h 8 for single-stranded DNA as well as for double-stranded DNA corresponding to the human Y-box were detected. The affinity for double-stranded DNA increased significantly with decreasing temperature, which was paralleled by an increase in the β sheet content of the protein. Temperature-dependent fluorescence anisotropy and far-UV CD measurements revealed different unfolding transitions at 28 and at 35.7 °C, respectively, indicating a multistate transition, which is uncommon for CSPs. The enhanced affinity for DNA at low temperatures together with the low unfolding transition refer to the functional significance of Cla h 8 at reduced temperatures.

Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and thus the entire protein family was attributed a cold shock regulatory function (1.Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 2.Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Curr. Opin.

Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) in the course of translational control at decreased temperatures, binding nonspecifically to RNA in order to prevent the formation of secondary structure and thereby enabling efficient initiation of translation. Further, it regulates the synthesis of other cold stress-inducible proteins through transcription antitermination (22.Bae W. Inouye M. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7784-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, evidence has arisen that the physiological roles of cold shock proteins are not limited to responses at low temperatures (1.Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 2.Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Curr. Opin.

Many of them are expressed under physiological (growth) conditions, and it has been recently demonstrated that the production of CspA is also induced at 37 °C upon nutritional upshifts (23.Yamanaka K. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, cold shock proteins are present as functional domains of Yb proteins (24.Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 318-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). They were first reported to bind to the inverted CCAAT box (Y-box) of the major histocompatibility complex class II promoter sequence (13.Didier D.K. Schiddenbauer J. Woulfe S.L. Zacheis M. Schwartz B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7322-7732Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Yb proteins consist of a glycine-rich N-terminal domain with unknown function, a nucleic-acid binding (cold shock) domain, and a C-terminal domain responsible for dimerization (27.Izumi H. Imamura T. Nagatani G. Ise T. Murakami T. Uramoto H. Torigoe T. Ishigughi H. Yoshida Y. Nomoto M. Okamoto T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Funa K. Kohno K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1200-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).

In addition to their binding of RNA, Yb proteins were shown to be able to interact with double-stranded DNA (14.Hasegawa S.L. Doetsch P.W. Hamilton K.K. Martin A.M. Okenquist S.A. Lenz J. Boss J.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1200-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), while bacterial CSPs were found to interact only with single-stranded but not with double-stranded DNA (4.Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 15.Graumann P.

Here we report the biophysical characteristics of the first eukaryotic cold shock protein, which was found to be independently expressed as functional polypeptide and not as part of a Yb protein. The cold shock protein homologue was named Cla h 8 and is a minor allergen ofCladosporium herbarum (28.Achatz G. Oberkofler H. Lechnauer E. Simon B. Unger A. Kandler C. Ebner C. Prillinger H. Kraft D. Breitenbach M. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 213-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Allergic reactions to this mold lead to rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and allergic asthma. Although Cla h 8 shows high homology to bacterial cold shock proteins, it was found to display some previously unobserved characteristics especially with respect to DNA binding. It was shown to unfold at temperatures uncommonly low for CSPs, which is interpreted to correlate with the improved affinity of Cla h 8 for dsDNA at low temperatures referring to the functional significance of Cla h 8 at reduced temperatures. For the construction of a C. herbarum cDNA library, 4 μg of a modified pJuFo vector (29.Crameri R. Achatz G. Weichel M. Rhyner C. Tuksen K. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 461-469Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and subsequently treated with calf intestine phosphatase (30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 2 μg of C. herbarum cDNA inserts, prepared from a previously constructed λ-Zap expression library (28.Achatz G. Oberkofler H. Lechnauer E. Simon B. Unger A. Kandler C. Ebner C. Prillinger H. Kraft D. Breitenbach M. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 213-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) by EcoRI and XhoI digestion of isolated pBlueScript phagemid DNA excisedin vivo (31.Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 15: 7583-7600Crossref Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), was ligated into the cleaved vector. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue cells by electroporation, and an M13 phage surface expression library was generated by helper phage superinfection as previously described (32.Crameri R. Schaefer B. Gene Cloning and Analysis: Current Innovations. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, Norfolk, UK1997: 29-42Google Scholar). The library was selectively enriched for phage displaying IgE-binding proteins by biopanning in microtiter plates coated with pooled serum IgE from individuals allergic to C. herbarumcaptured with monoclonal mouse anti-human IgE monoclonal antibody TN-142 (33.Crameri R. Jaussi R. Menz G. Blaser K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Serum donors were selected according to case history, specific IgE to C. herbarum determined by radioallergosorbent test and skin reactivity to commercial C. herbarum extracts (34.Simon-Nobbe B. Probst G. Kajava A.V. Oberkofler H. Susani M. Crameri R. Ferreira-Briza F. Ebner C. Breitenbach M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 106: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A wide variety of phage binding to human serum IgE was isolated. Enriched phagemids were used to infect E. coli XL1-Blue cells, plated onto square agar plates at a density of 2000–5000 colonies per plate and grown at 37 °C overnight. Using a picking/gridding robot, 5376 colonies were arrayed into 384-well microtiter plates, grown at 37 °C, and replicated into new microtiter plates using a 384-pin replication tool to produce working copies (35.Crameri R. Kodzius R. Combin. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2001; 4: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). cDNA inserts of all picked clones were amplified by PCR in 384-well format, and PCR products were gridded in duplicate onto 222 × 222 mm Nylon filter membranes at a density of 27,648 spots/filter using a picking/gridding robot (36.Crameri R. Kodzius R. Konthur Z. Lehrach H. Blaser K. Walter G. Tapping Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 2001; 124: 43-47Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Repetitive filter hybridizations using digoxigenin-labeled PCR probes derived from randomly selected clones were performed as described (37.Maier E. Meier E.X. Ahmadi A.R. Curtis J. Lehrach H. J. Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 433-455Google Scholar) until all different sequences contained in the 5376-clone sample were identified (38.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The 38 different inserts obtained were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (39.Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). Both DNA strands were sequenced using vector-derived primers. Homology searches and sequence comparisons were performed with BLAST and the Genetics Computer Group program FASTA. One clone revealed strong homology with nucleotide sequences encoding cold shock protein. The cDNA encoding Cla h 8 was amplified by standard PCR from the corresponding phagemid using the following primers: 5′-primer, 5′-CG GGATCC ATG GAC GCC TCC ACC GAA CG-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-CC AAGCTT TTA GTT GTT GCG GAC GCT GG-3′, thus introducing a BamHI and a HindIII restriction site (underlined). PCR cycling conditions were 94 °C for 60 s, 54 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for 30 cycles, followed by a terminal extension cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplification product was purified over QIAquick spin columns (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), digested with BamHI and HindIII, ligated toBamHI/HindIII-restricted p(His6)-DHFR vector (40.Moser M. Crameri R. Menz G. Schneider T. Dudler T. Virchow C. Gmachl M. Blaser K. Suter M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 454-460PubMed Google Scholar) and transformed into E. coli strain M15 (41.Crameri R. Faith A. Hemmann S. Jaussi R. Ismail C. Menz G. Blaser K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) by electroporation. Transformants were grown in liquid culture to verify the nucleotide sequence (30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used to produce hexahistidine-tagged recombinant protein. The specific binding of human serum IgE from individuals sensitized to C. herbarum to recombinant Cla h 8 was analyzed by an antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (42.Moser M. Crameri R. Brust E. Suter M. Menz G. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 93: 1-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A single colony containing M15 E. coli cells was inoculated in LB Amp/Kana medium at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.5–0.9. The expression of His6-Cla h 8 was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 5000 ×g), and the pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm NaPi, pH 7, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Trasylol). Subsequently, the cells were broken by ultrasonication (3 × 20 s, 80 W) on ice followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was tested by SDS-PAGE for the presence of soluble His6-Cla h 8 fusion protein and was then applied to a TALON metal affinity resin column (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The His6-Cla h 8 fusion protein was eluted from the resin by pulsing with 1 ml of elution buffer (50 mmNaPi, pH 7, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Trasylol, 150 mm imidazole). After this step, a purification of 95% was achieved. To further increase the purity of the protein, the combined Cla h 8-containing fractions were dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm NaPi, pH 7.2) and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). A discontinuous gradient was run from 0 → 60% B in 10 min, and from 60% → 100% B in 50 min (buffer B = 20 mm NaPi, 1.2 mNaCl, pH 7.2). Cla h 8 with a purity of >99% was thus obtained (see Fig. 1). Fractions containing pure Cla h 8 were pooled, extensively dialyzed against 50 mm NaPi and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, and stored at −20 °C. The concentration of Cla h 8 was determined by the Bradford assay (43.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of 5 μm Cla h 8 was recorded on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic, Tokyo, Japan). Far-UV CD measurements were carried out in the range between 195–250 nm using a quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm, a response time of 0.25 s, and a data point resolution of 0.1 nm. Three scans were recorded to obtain smooth spectra. Mean residue ellipticities of background-corrected spectra were calculated by JASCO standard analysis. Analysis of the spectra with respect to secondary structure content was performed using the algorithm SELCON (44.Srerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). For thermal denaturation studies, Cla h 8 was diluted into 50 mm NaPi pH 7.2, and 50 mm NaCl to a final concentration of 38 μm. A spectrum at the indicated temperature was recorded after an equilibration period of 3 min. A model of the three-dimensional structure of Cla h 8 was obtained by homology-based modeling using the Swiss-Model server (45.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). As templates, the structures of the CSPs of E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus caldolyticus(PDB entries 3MEF, 1NMG, and 1C9O) were used. Further refinement of the Cla h 8 structure was accomplished by applying 200 steps of steepest descent energy minimization followed by a 100-ps molecular dynamics simulation using the program Insight II and Discover (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, CA). Throughout the refinement procedure, the total energy of the system was found to decrease and to reach a stable minimum value after 30 ps of molecular dynamics simulation. Steady state fluorescence measurements were performed at room temperature on a Perkin Elmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorometer. The emission of a 60 nm equilibrated Cla h 8 solution upon excitation at 282 nm was recorded over the range of 300–400 nm. Binding isotherms were obtained by coupling the cuvette holder to a thermostat and by the addition of an aliquot of the respective oligonucleotide ligand, allowing for an equilibration period of 2 min. The slit width was set at 10 and 15 nm for excitation and emission, respectively, and the spectra were recorded with 200 nm/min. A 290-nm cut-off was inserted to avoid stray light. As ss ligands, the oligonucleotides 5′-GTGGGAATCCTACTGATTGGCCAAGGTGCTGGTGG-3′ (Yb+) and 5′-CCACCAGCACCTTGGCCAATCCAGTAGGATTCCCAC-3′ (Yb−) were used. The concentration of the oligonucleotides was determined by their absorption at 260 nm. To obtain the corresponding dsDNA (Yb±), equimolar amounts of Yb+ and Yb− were annealed by heating the mixture for 5 min at 65 °C followed by a slow cooling period of 60 min to 30 °C. According to reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (data not shown), the yield of dsDNA thus obtained was >95% Yb±, which was therefore used in the isothermal titration experiments without further purification. The fluorescence spectra of Cla h 8 were background-corrected, and the respective areas were integrated between 300 and 400 nm. The normalized mean changes in fluorescence intensity (−ΔF/F 0) resulting from three independent experiments were plotted against the ligand concentration. The resulting binding isotherms were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (Microcal Inc.) to Equation 1 describing a bimolecular association reaction as described previously (17.Lopez M.M.

The fitted parameters wereF max and K d. Temperature-induced anisotropy changes were recorded at an emission wavelength of 336 nm by a stepwise increase of the temperature of a 300 nm Cla h 8 solution in the range 8–90 °C. Five minutes of equilibration at each temperature were allowed before the anisotropy signal was measured over 30 s. The data shown represent the mean of three independent measurements. Cla h 8 consists of 73 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 8.1 kDa. The sequence of Cla h 8 is shown in Fig. 2. It displays high sequence homology with bacterial CSPs like CspA from E. coli (76% homology) and CspB from B. subtilis (70% homology). Although from eukaryotic origin, it exhibits only 57% homology with the cold shock domain of the human Yb-binding protein 1. As in the bacterial CSPs, highly conserved regions within Cla h 8 are the β1-, β2-, and β3-sheets, which correspond to the putative oligonucleotide binding sites of the protein. Based upon the high sequence homology, a similar overall fold of Cla h 8 compared with the structurally well documented bacterial CSPs can be expected. It was therefore possible to compute a homology-based model of Cla h 8 based on the three-dimensional structures of the CSPs of E. coli,B. subtilis, and B. caldolyticus (4.Schindelin H.

Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). The obtained structure was further refined by applying energy minimization and molecular dynamics computer simulation (see “Materials and Methods”). The final model of Cla h 8 exhibited a five-stranded β-barrel structure (not shown) and was therefore found to correspond to the general fold of the CSP family. However, the subtle differences in the primary structure between Cla h 8 and bacterial CSPs,e.g. an arginine residue at position 38 of Cla h 8, which is occupied by a serine or a threonine side chain in most bacterial CSPs, may be responsible for the differences in the oligonucleotide binding behavior outlined below. To experimentally determine the secondary structure content of Cla h 8, far-UV CD spectra were recorded (see Fig. 3). Analysis of the spectrum recorded at 25 °C with respect to secondary structure (43.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) showed that 41% of the residues exhibit β-sheet structure. This value increased to 52% when the temperature was decreased to 15 °C (see Fig. 3) referring to an overall stabilization of the predicted all-β structure of Cla h 8 at reduced temperatures. Absolute values of secondary structure content must be regarded very cautiously because of the possible impact of aromatic amino acids on the secondary structure analysis especially in the β-sheet range. However, since we are comparing two states of the same protein under different conditions with respect to β-sheet content, the relative increase is revealed with high confidence. The α-helical content of Cla h 8 was found to be very low (<7%), independent from the temperature, thus further confirming the all-β structure of the protein. Because of the structural stabilization of Cla h 8 observed at reduced temperatures (see Fig. 3), thermal unfolding curves using far-UV CD spectroscopy, which relate to the protein's secondary structure, were recorded at three different wavelengths: 208 nm, 216 nm, and 222 nm. The results are displayed in Fig. 4. They reveal a transition of unfolding at 35.7 °C, which is uncommonly low compared with other bacterial CSPs (9.Wassenberg D. Welker C. Jaenicke R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10.Hillier B.J. Rodriguez H.M. Gregoret L.M.

The transition of unfolding increased, however, to 42.2 °C upon addition of Yb+ (see Fig. 5), which is a ssDNA ligand of Cla h 8 (see below). Ligand binding obviously stabilizes the protein indicating an induced fit of Cla h 8 upon ligand binding.Figure 5Thermal unfolding of 38 μm Cla h 8 monitored by far-UV CD spectroscopy at 208 nm in the absence (▪) and in the presence (○) of the ssDNA ligand Yb+. The values shown represent the mean values of three independent measurements. The transition point was calculated by fitting the data to the Boltzmann equation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To monitor the unfolding of Cla h 8 by detecting changes of the tertiary/quaternary structure, the temperature-dependent fluorescence anisotropy of the protein was recorded (see Fig. 6). The fluorescence emission of Cla h 8 was dominated by the intrinsic tryptophan chromophore at position 14. Depolarization of the fluorescence occurs due to the local movements of the fluorophore and to the rotational motion of the protein. The latter parameter corresponds to the hydrodynamic volume and thus to the oligomerization state of the macromolecule. As can be seen in Fig. 6, a single transition at 28.0 °C to lower anisotropy values upon increasing the temperature was obtained. The difference in the unfolding transitions observed in the CD and the fluorescence measurements clearly indicate a multistate transition (51.Lumry R. Biltomen R. Brandts J.F. Biopolymers. 1966; 4: 917-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To investigate the affinity of Cla h 8 for DNA, isothermal fluorescence titration curves of Cla h 8 were recorded using, as in the fluorescence anisotropy measurements, the intrinsic fluorescence emission of Trp-14. This residue is highly conserved in the CSP family and is supposed to directly interact with oligonucleotides. As ligands, two ssDNAs were used, corresponding to the 35-mers of the sense (Yb+) and the antisense (Yb−) region of the human Y-box 1 (see “Materials and Methods”), as well as the annealed ds oligonucleotide Yb±. Unlike CspA and CspB (16.Lopez M.M. Makhatadze G.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17.Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15511-15518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), Yb− bound to Cla h 8 with a significantly higher affinity than Yb+ at the cellular growth optimum temperature (25 °C, see Table I). This clear discrimination was lost under cold shock conditions (13 °C). The β-sheet content, as detected by CD spectroscopy, was found to increase by the addition of a molar excess of each of the three ligands at 13 °C (data not shown). Interestingly, at 13 °C as well as at 25 °C, only Yb− induced a 10-nm red shift of the fluorescence maximum upon complete saturation, whereas Yb+ and Yb± only quenched the fluorescence emission without a shift. This refers to different Cla h 8 binding geometries of Yb− compared with Yb+ and Yb±. Contrary to CspA, the dsDNA (Yb±) was found to bind with significant affinity to Cla h 8 at 25 °C (see Table I). This affinity was increased by a factor of 3–4 when the temperature was decreased to 13 °C, whereas no binding of Yb± was detected at 37 °C (see Fig. 7) because of the partial unfolding of Cla h 8 at this temperature. In addition, the ability of Cla h 8 to discriminate between ssDNA and dsDNA was found to be higher at 25 °C than at 13 °C, as becomes obvious from comparing the dissociation constants of Yb− and Yb± at these two temperatures (see Table I).Table IDissociation constants of Cla h 8TemperatureInteractionK d°C× 10−9mCla h 8/Yb+4.7 ± 113Cla h 8/Yb−5.9 ± 1.8Cla h 8/Yb±7.6 ± 1Cla h 8/Yb+11 ± 1.725Cla h 8/Yb−3.2 ± 1.3Cla h 8/Yb±27.4 ± 3.1The dissociation constants of the interaction of Cla h 8 with different ligands were obtained by analysing the fluorescence binding isotherms according to Eq. 1. Open table in a new tab The dissociation constants of the interaction of Cla h 8 with different ligands were obtained by analysing the fluorescence binding isotherms according to Eq. 1. Cla h 8 was identified as an IgE-binding protein from aC. herbarum phage surface-displayed cDNA library. This minor allergen of C. herbarum exhibited high sequence homology with bacterial CSPs and was therefore identified as the first eukaryotic cold shock protein that is not a functional domain of a Y-box binding protein. In prokaryotes, little is known about the involvement of CSPs in dsDNA processing. Although CspA was shown to act as a cold shock transcriptional enhancer of at least two genes inE. coli, the protein lacks in vitro any ability of binding to dsDNA (49.LaTeana A. Brandi A. Falconi M. Spurio R. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10907-10911Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 50.Jones P.G. Krah R. Tafuri S.A. Wolffe A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5798-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, Y-box binding proteins act as transcription factors, and they were shown to bind to dsDNA in vitro. The cold shock domain of Y-box binding proteins was found to be necessary but not sufficient for the interaction with dsDNA (27.Izumi H. Imamura T. Nagatani G. Ise T. Murakami T. Uramoto H. Torigoe T. Ishigughi H. Yoshida Y. Nomoto M. Okamoto T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Funa K. Kohno K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1200-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, the basic amino acids-containing loop between the β3 and β4 strands of the human Y-box binding protein 1 was shown to be important for dsDNA binding, and that this loop, when incorporated into CspA, induced dsDNA binding in this bacterial CSP (26.Wang N. Yamanaka K. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, this loop was not found in Cla h 8, although the protein's ability to bind to dsDNA, especially at low temperatures, is striking (see Fig. 7). It can therefore be hypothesized that Cla h 8 represents an evolutionary link between prokaryotic CSPs and eukaryotic cold shock domains contained within Y-box-binding proteins. Structurally, the overall fold of Cla h 8 is assumed to resemble the all-β-sheet motif of bacterial CSPs. This is due to the high sequence homology of Cla h 8 with bacterial CSPs, which allowed the modeling of a reliable three-dimensional structure of the allergen. The high β-sheet content of the protein became manifest in the far-UV CD spectra of the protein (see Fig. 3). However, Cla h 8 seems to be much less stable than bacterial CSPs, exhibiting thermal unfolding transitions at 35.7 or at 28 °C (see Figs. 4 and 6) depending upon the method used; unfolding monitored by CD spectroscopy refers to a transition of the protein's secondary structure, whereas fluorescence anisotropy refers to a transition of the protein's tertiary and quaternary structure. The different transition temperatures found by the two methods, which reflect different structural features, refer to a multistate thermal transition of Cla h 8 (51.Lumry R. Biltomen R. Brandts J.F. Biopolymers. 1966; 4: 917-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The low unfolding transition of Cla h 8 might refer to a short lifetime of the uncomplexed protein in vivo. Thermal stability of Cla h 8 was found to increase by the addition of ssDNA (see Fig. 5). We have recently shown that in the case of nucleotide or carbohydrate binding the thermal stability of proteins like transcription factors or chemokines can be improved significantly (52.Goger G. Halden Y. Rek A. Mösl R. Pye D. Gallagher J. Kungl A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 53.Kristl S. Zhao S. Knappe B. Somerville R.L. Kungl A.J. FEBS Letters. 2000; 467: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Additional intramolecular bonds between the receptor and the ligand lead, if exothermic, together with a reduction of the degrees of freedom to a significant stabilization of the protein structure. Cla h 8 can therefore be postulated to bind with high affinity to nucleic acidsin vivo to increase its own stability. If thereby the stability of, for example, mRNA becomes decreased Cla h 8 acts as a so-called RNA chaperone, a function which has long been proposed for CSPs (21.Jjiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol.

These parameters yielded the intrinsic transactivation potential (ITP), defined as the activation observed with equal amounts of DNA bound protein. Exchange of 83 amino acids at the COOH-terminal end of the PRD by 16 unrelated amino acids, as found in NF1-C2, and splicing out the central region of the PRD, as found in NF1-C7, enhanced DNA binding in vivo and in vitro.

Additional mutations showed that the ITP of NF1-C requires the synergistic action of the PRD and a novel domain encoded in exons 5 and 6. Intriguingly the carboxyl-terminal domain-like motif encoded in exons 9/10 is not essential for transactivation of a reporter with a single NF1 site but is required for activation of a reporter with six NF1 sites in tandem.

Our results imply that differential splicing is used to regulate transcription by generating variants with different DNA binding affinities but similar ITPs. Regulation of transcription operates by the combinatorial action of sequence-specific trans-acting factors bound to upstream regulatory regions of promoters and enhancer/silencer regions. The particular linear disposition of these cis-regulatory sequences and their topological organization in chromatin, along with the cellular repertoire of transcription factors results in the formation of gene- and cell-specific constellations of chromatin bound factors. The particular array of proteins on the chromatin target modulates the transcriptional rates by multiple interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes, co-regulators, and components of the basal transcriptional machinery (1.Lemon B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulators often exhibit a modular structure with independent DNA-binding domains (DBDs) 1The abbreviations used are: DBDDNA-binding domainNF1nuclear factor 1PRDproline-rich transactivation domainITPintrinsic transactivation potentialCTDCOOH-terminal domainMMTVmouse mammary tumor virusGEMSAgel electrophoretic mobility shift assay and regulatory regions. The transactivation domains are classified according to their amino acid composition as either rich in acidic side chains, glutamine, or proline residues (2.Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). Although the precise fashion by which transactivators regulate transcription of a specific gene depends on many different promoter features and cell-specific factors, the mechanisms of action for acidic and proline-rich domains appear to be conserved in eukaryotic organisms from yeast to man (3.Kim T.K.

The expression of these variants is tightly regulated in a cell-type or developmental-stage specific manner. Alternative splicing is the mechanism most widely used to generate this precisely regulated, diversity of transcription factors. However, with few exceptions, the functional significance of transcription factor variants generated by alternative splicing is poorly understood (5.Lopez A.J. Dev.

The prototype of the proline-rich class of activators is nuclear factor 1 (NF1), originally identified through its role in stimulating adenovirus DNA replication (7.Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T.

NF1 is expressed in vertebrates from at least four different genes (NF1-A, NF1-B,NF1-C/CTF, and NF1-X), each of them giving rise to different variants by alternative splicing of the COOH terminus (9.Santoro C.

This wide variety of forms is differentially expressed during mouse development and regulates the activity of many genes expressed in multiple organs (Ref.15.Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar and references therein). Disruption of the NF1-A gene in mice causes multiple developmental defects and perinatal lethality (16.das Neves L. Duchala C.S. Godinho F. Haxhiu M.A. Colmenares C. Macklin W.B. Campbell C.E.

A. 1999; 96: 11946-11951Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least some functions of the various NF1 proteins are not redundant. However, the functional implications of the existence of a large variety of NF1 proteins remain largely unknown. Comparison of the primary structures of different NF1-C variants reveals their modular organization (Fig. 1 A). All variants share a very well conserved NH2 terminus containing the DBD and the dimerization domain. This NH2-terminal half activates Adenovirus 2 DNA replication by interacting with the viral DNA polymerase (17.Armentero M.T. Horwitz M. Mermod N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The COOH-terminal half can be divided in a central region, which is specific for the products of each of the four genes, and a variable carboxy region, which is specific for each splice variant (13.Kruse U.

A functional comparison of NF1-C variants showed different efficiencies of transcriptional activation, indicating that the very COOH-terminal region determines the transcriptional potential of NF1 (20.Wenzelides S. Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2416-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21.Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3901-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This region contains the proline-rich transactivation domain (PRD), whose importance in the transactivation functions of NF1 has been largely confirmed (3.Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20866-20869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of this region identified a sequence homologous to the COOH-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II as an essential element of the PRD. In addition, a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids contributes strongly to the activity of the CTD-like motif (22.Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 251Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23.Wendler W. Altmann H. Winnacker E.L.

The very last 20 amino acids at the COOH terminus of NF1-C1 have been reported to interact with the globular domain of histone H3 and may mediate regulation of NF1-C1 activity by transforming growth factor-β (25.Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, some variants lacking most of the PRD and the CTD-like motif enhance transcription to a greater extent than the full-length NF1-C1 (20.Wenzelides S. Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2416-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21.Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3901-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These observations suggested the existence of additional regulatory sequences in NF1-C, and placed a question mark on the role of the variable PRD in transactivation by NF1-C. Here we report studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showing that although the absolute transactivation obtained with three natural splice variants of NF1-C (NF1-C1, NF1-C2, and NF1-C7, differing in their PRD) are different, this is largely due to differences in DNA binding. Once corrected for DNA binding activity, the intrinsic transactivation potential (ITP) of the three isoforms is similar and requires the synergistic action of the PRD and an internal region encoded by exons 5 and 6. The CTD-like motif exhibits a reporter-specific behavior. We show that the splice variants NF1-C2 and NF1-C7 bind to DNA with higher affinity than the full-length NF1-C1 and conclude that splicing out part of the PRD regulates transactivation by increasing the DNA affinity of the resulting protein without affecting its ITP once bound to DNA.

Transcription activity was determined by β-galactosidase assays of permeabilized cells (33.Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown overnight in the appropriate selective medium at 30 °C, diluted to an A 660 of 0.1, and incubated for 8 h. Cells were then harvested and assayed for β-galactosidase activity (33.Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). For the preparation of the NF1 DNA probe, the oligonucleotides 5′-cctttggcactgtgccaag-3′ and 5′-cctttggcacagtgccaag-3′ were annealed, gel-purified, and end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP. The binding reactions contained the indicated amounts of yeast protein extract, prepared as described previously (34.McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In a final volume of 20 μl the reactions contained: 12 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 210 mm KCl, 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 4.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), 3 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5–1 ng of the labeled probe. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis (4 h at 200 V) on 5% polyacrylamide, 10% glycerol gels (acrylamide to bisacrylamide weight ratio of 37.5:1) in 0.5 × TBE at 4 °C. Quantification of DNA complexes was performed with a PhosphorImager. 1–40 μg of yeast protein extract were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nylon membranes. After blocking with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk, proteins were detected with antibody against the hemeagglutinine tag and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The blots were washed with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reactions (Amersham Bioscience). DNase I treatment was performed as described previously (35.Chávez S. Candau R. Truss M. Beato M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6987-6998Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, transformants were grown in appropriate selective medium to mid-log phase. Cells were harvested, spheroplasts were prepared and treated with different amounts of DNase I. After DNA extraction, DNase I-cleaved genomic DNA samples were extended for 30 cycles with a radioactively labeled primer, GAL-pLR (5′-agtattagttaaagtggttatgcag-3′), corresponding to the sequence located 96 bp downstream of the 6 NF1 sites in pLR-NF1(x6). Amplified DNA was resolved on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Quantification was performed by a PhosphoImager. To gain insight into the mechanisms of transcriptional activation by members of the NF1 family we have studied the ITP of three natural NF1-C splice variants (Fig. 1 A). We have chosen the yeastS. cerevisiae for these studies because NF1-C is known to transactivate in this organism and endogenous NF1 homologues are not known. NF1-C1 encompasses all 11 exons of the gene (Fig. 1 A). In NF1-C2, the splicing of exon 9 deletes 83 amino acids of the PRD and creates a new reading frame leading to the COOH-terminal addition of 16 amino acids with a high proline content. NF1-C7 lacks exons 7, 8, and 9 including most of the PRD (Fig. 1 A) (12.Meisterernst M. Rogge L. Foeckler R. Karaghiosoff M. Winnacker E.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8191-8200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21.Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3901-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We transformed yeast with plasmids expressing each of these variants together with the reporter plasmid pLR-NF1(x6) (21.Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3901-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this plasmid, which we will name NF16GAL1, thelacZ gene is driven by the GAL1 promoter with its regulatory region replaced by six NF1-binding sites. As previously reported, NF1-C7 transactivated this promoter to a much larger extent than NF1-C1 (Fig. 1 A), despite lacking most of the PRD (21.Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3901-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). NF1-C2 transactivated with similar efficiency (48%) as NF1-C1 (Fig. 1 A), confirming previous findings in DrosophilaSchneider cells (9.Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 18.Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We also tested the behavior of the three NF1-C variants in the context of a natural promoter with only one NF1 site, namely a mutant MMTV promoter (MMTVΔ), truncated just upstream of the NF1-binding site to remove the hormone responsive region (29.Candau R. Chávez S. Beato M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the activity on this promoter was lower, the results with the NF1-C variants were qualitatively similar to those obtained with NF16GAL1 (Fig. 1 A). NF1-C7 was by far the best transactivator, while NF1-C2 was very similar to NF1-C1. Thus, independent of the reporter used, NF1-C7 was a better transactivator than NF1-C1 and NF1-C2. Most studies on the transactivation properties of NF1 in yeast have not taken into account possible differences in levels of expression or in DNA binding affinity of the different variants. To incorporate these parameters in our study, we determined the extent of specific DNA binding to calculate the ITP of each variant by comparing amounts of protein yielding equivalent DNA binding activity. To establish the reliability of our measurements, we first expressed NF1-C1under control of the regulated MET25 promoter, whose activity depends on the methionine concentration in the medium. We prepared extracts from cells grown at different methionine concentrations and measured β-galactosidase activity and specific binding to an oligonucleotide with a NF1-binding site by GEMSA. As expected, DNA binding increased with progressive activation of theMET25 promoter (Fig. 2 A). Within the range tested, the NF1-C1 dependent activation of the NF16GAL1 reporter was a linear function of the amount of DNA binding activity (Fig. 2 B, circles). The same is true for the MMTVΔ promoter (data not shown), confirming the validity of our quantitation of DNA binding. Next we compared the DNA binding activity of extracts from cells expressing the three natural variants of NF1-C. While extracts containing NF1-C1 and NF1-C2 showed very similar binding to the NF1 oligonucleotide, extracts containing NF1-C7 showed a 7-fold higher specific DNA binding (Fig. 1 B). The activation values obtained with the three NF1-C variants in these experiments fitted very well in the standard curve constructed with NF1-C1 under the control of the inducible MET25 promoter (Fig. 2 B,squares). Correction of the transactivation activities (Fig. 1 A) by the corresponding DNA binding values of the NF1-C variants yielded their respective ITP, which were very similar on the MMTVΔ reporter (Fig. 1 C, light columns). On the NF16GAL1 reporter, NF1-C2 exhibited a 2-fold lower intrinsic transcriptional potential when compared with NF1-C1 and NF1-C7 (Fig. 1 C, dark columns) (see below). These results demonstrate that the splicing of different regions of the PRD of NF1-C1 generates two proteins, NF1-C2 and NF1-C7, with different DNA binding activity, but with similar ITP. Previous work on NF1 has defined the COOH-terminal PRD as the main transactivation determinant of the protein (3.Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20866-20869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). However, the results obtained with NF1-C7 show that most of the PRD of NF1-C1 could be spliced out without affecting the ITP. Along the same line, the natural variant NF1-C5, which lacks exons 9 and 10, acts as a strong transactivator in yeast (20.Wenzelides S. Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2416-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the presence of additional transactivation functions in NF1-C. To address this issue, we have analyzed different deletion mutants of the full-length NF1-C1 for their ability to transactivate the two reporter genes in yeast (Fig. 3 A). As for the natural NF1-C variants, the activities of the mutant proteins have been corrected for their corresponding DNA binding activities (Fig. 3 B) to calculate their ITP once bound to DNA (Fig. 3 C). In previous studies the core PRD has been defined as the region encoded in exons 9–11 (amino acids 407–506). Deletion of this region, as in NF1-C406, led to a dramatic reduction in transactivation of both reporters (Fig. 3 A). This was accompanied by a 5-fold reduction in DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 B). After correction for DNA binding, the ITP of NF1-C406 on the NF16GAL1 and the MMTVΔ reporter was 5 and 15% that of NF1-C1, respectively (Fig. 3 C), confirming that the core PRD is important for transactivation. As exon 8 is also rich in proline (19.5%), we tested the behavior of a deletion of all the proline-rich regions (exons 8–11). This deletion, NF1-C362, showed slightly higher transactivation than NF1-C406 (Fig. 3 A), but a 13-fold higher DNA binding activity compared with NF1-C406 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the ITP was further reduced 3-fold, to 1.3% of NF1-C1 with the NF16GAL1 reporter and 5% with the MMTVΔ reporter (Fig. 3 C). These results confirm the importance of the proline-rich region, and show that it encompasses sequences encoded in exons 8–11 of NF1-C1. Constructions lacking this region exhibited 3-fold higher residual activity on the MMTV reporter than on the reporter with six NF1-binding sites, suggesting that the PRD is also involved in the synergism between DNA-bound NF1 molecules. Although part of the proline-rich region can be deleted and replaced by different sequences without influencing the ITP, as in NF1-C2 and NF1-C7 (Fig. 1), other regions are obviously essential. It remains to be elucidated what additional features of these regions, besides the high proline content, determine their transactivation properties. If the PRD were the only transactivation function within the COOH-terminal half of NF1-C, a protein with this domain fused to the DBD, as generated by deleting exons 5–7, should display similar activity as the intact protein, provided the DBD has no transactivation function. We confirmed that the NF1-DBD, although able to transactivate to some extent when expressed from a strong promoter (Fig. 3 A), had negligible ITP (Fig. 3 C,C229) after correction for the high DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 B, C229). The internal deletion of exons 5–7 in construct NF1-CΔ234–406 led to a 2–2.5-fold decrease in transactivation (Fig. 3 A) and to a 4-fold increase in DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 B). After appropriate correction this construction showed a 10-fold decrease of ITP compared with intact NF1-C1 (Fig. 3 C). Nevertheless, these values were still 7–10-fold higher than those obtained with the DBD of NF1-C (Fig. 3 C, compare CΔ234–406 andC229). These findings identify a transactivation function in sequences encoded by exons 5–7. Since NF1-C7 shows maximal activity and lacks amino acids 320–472 (Fig. 1), and deletion of exon 7 encoded sequences does not reduce the ITP (compare C319 andC362), the novel transactivation function must be located between amino acids 234–319 in the region encoded by exons 5 and 6. A construction including just the DBD and exons 5–6, NF1-C319, exhibited low but reproducible ITP, in particular with the MMTVΔ reporter (Fig. 3 C) (see below). Thus, our results with natural variants and mutations support the existence of a weak internal transactivation domain in the region encompassing exons 5 and 6. As the sum of the ITPs of the PRD and this internal domain accounts only for 15–20% of the ITP of NF1-C1, the two domains seem to act synergistically in the intact protein. The PRD of NF1 contains a sequence with a striking similarity to the heptapeptide repeats of the CTD of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. This CTD-like motif has been claimed to be essential for the transactivation function of the PRD (22.Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 251Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23.Wendler W. Altmann H. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2601-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24.Xiao H. Lis J.T. Xiao H. Greenblatt J. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, this claim is in conflict with the strong ITP of the natural variants NF1-C2 and NF1-C5, which lack the CTD-like motif (Fig. 1 and Ref. 20.Wenzelides S. Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2416-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested a selective deletion of this motif. The resulting protein, NF1-CΔCT7, exhibited a lower transactivation than NF1-C1 (Fig. 3 A) and an almost normal DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 B). These changes result in a 5-fold decrease in its ITP on the NF16GAL1 promoter (Fig. 3 C), in agreement with previous results with similar constructs (23.Wendler W. Altmann H. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2601-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24.Xiao H. Lis J.T. Xiao H. Greenblatt J. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the ITP of NF1-CΔCT7 was hardly affected when tested on the MMTVΔ promoter, which contains a single NF1-binding site (Fig. 3 C). Except C229, all constructions lacking"
https://openalex.org/W2074932195,"Elongin C is a highly conserved, low molecular weight protein found in a variety of multiprotein complexes in human, rat, fly, worm, and yeast cells. Among the best characterized of these complexes is a mammalian E3 ligase that targets proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Despite its crucial role as a component of such E3 ligases and other complexes, the specific function of Elongin C is unknown. In yeast, Elongin C is a non-essential gene and there is no obvious phenotype as associated with its absence. We previously reported that inSaccharomyces cerevisiae Elongin C (Elc1) interacts specifically and strongly with a class of proteins loosely defined as stress response proteins. In the present study, we examined the role of yeast Elc1 in the turnover of two of these binding partners, Snf4 and Pcl6. Deletion of Elc1 resulted in decreased steady-state levels of Snf4 and Pcl6 as indicated by Western blot analysis. Northern blot analysis of mRNA prepared from elc1 null and wild type strains revealed no difference in mRNA levels for Snf4 and Pcl6 establishing that the effects of Elc1 are not transcriptionally mediated. Reintroduction of either yeast or human Elongin C into Elc1 null strains abrogated this effect. Taken together, these data document that the levels of Snf4 and Pcl6 are dependent on the presence of Elc1 and that binding to Elc1 inhibits the degradation of these proteins. The results suggest a new function for yeast Elongin C that is distinct from a direct role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis."
