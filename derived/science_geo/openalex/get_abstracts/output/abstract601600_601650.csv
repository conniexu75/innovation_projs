https://openalex.org/W2776116431,"Hematologic and biochemical analytes of Sprague-Dawley rats are commonly used to determine effects that were induced by treatment and to evaluate organ dysfunction in toxicological safety assessments, but reference intervals have not been well established for these analytes. Reference intervals as presently defined for these analytes in Sprague-Dawley rats have not used internationally recommended statistical method nor stratified by sex. Thus, we aimed to establish sex-specific reference intervals for hematologic and biochemical parameters in Sprague-Dawley rats according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute C28-A3 and American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology guideline.Hematology and biochemistry blood samples were collected from 500 healthy Sprague-Dawley rats (250 males and 250 females) in the control groups. We measured 24 hematologic analytes with the Sysmex XT-2100i analyzer, 9 biochemical analytes with the Olympus AU400 analyzer. We then determined statistically relevant sex partitions and calculated reference intervals, including corresponding 90% confidence intervals, using nonparametric rank percentile method.We observed that most hematologic and biochemical analytes of Sprague-Dawley rats were significantly influenced by sex. Males had higher hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, white blood cell count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, percentage of neutrophils, percentage of monocytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and triglycerides compared to females. Females had higher mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, plateletcrit, platelet count, eosinophils, percentage of lymphocytes, percentage of eosinophils, creatinine, glucose, total cholesterol and urea compared to males. Sex partition was required for most hematologic and biochemical analytes in Sprague-Dawley rats. We established sex-specific reference intervals, including corresponding 90% confidence intervals, for Sprague-Dawley rats.Understanding the significant discrepancies in hematologic and biochemical analytes between male and female Sprague-Dawley rats provides important insight into physiological effects in test rats. Establishment of locally sex-specific reference intervals allows a more precise evaluation of animal quality and experimental results of Sprague-Dawley rats in our toxicology safety assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2951580700,"We are moving into the age of ‘Big Data’ in biomedical research and bioinformatics. This trend could be encapsulated in this simple formula: D = S * F, where the volume of data generated (D) increases in both dimensions: the number of samples (S) and the number of sample features (F). Frequently, a typical omics classification includes redundant and irrelevant features (e.g. genes or proteins) that can result in long computation times; decrease of the model performance and the selection of suboptimal features (genes and proteins) after the classification/regression step. Multiple algorithms and reviews has been published to describe all the existing methods for feature selection, their strengths and weakness. However, the selection of the correct FS algorithm and strategy constitutes an enormous challenge. Despite the number and diversity of algorithms available, the proper choice of an approach for facing a specific problem often falls in a ‘grey zone’. In this study, we select a subset of FS methods to develop an efficient workflow and an R package for bioinformatics machine learning problems. We cover relevant issues concerning FS, ranging from domain’s problems to algorithm solutions and computational tools. Finally, we use seven different proteomics and gene expression datasets to evaluate the workflow and guide the FS process."
https://openalex.org/W2776673097,"Aedes aegypti is the main vector for yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. Recent outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya have been reported in Kenya. Presence and abundance of this vector is associated with the risk for the occurrence and transmission of these diseases. This study aimed to characterize the presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti adult mosquitoes from rural and urban sites in western and coastal regions of Kenya. Presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti adult mosquitoes were determined indoors and outdoors in two western (urban Kisumu and rural Chulaimbo) and two coastal (urban Ukunda and rural Msambweni) sites in Kenya. Sampling was performed using quarterly human landing catches, monthly Prokopack automated aspirators and monthly Biogents-sentinel traps. A total of 2,229 adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected: 785 (35.2%) by human landing catches, 459 (20.6%) by Prokopack aspiration and 985 (44.2%) by Biogents-sentinel traps. About three times as many Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected in urban than rural sites (1,650 versus 579). Comparable numbers were collected in western (1,196) and coastal (1,033) sites. Over 80% were collected outdoors through human landing catches and Prokopack aspiration. The probability of collecting Ae. aegypti mosquitoes by human landing catches was significantly higher in the afternoon than morning hours (P<0.001), outdoors than indoors (P<0.001) and in urban than rural sites (P = 0.008). Significantly more Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected using Prokopack aspiration outdoors than indoors (P<0.001) and in urban than rural areas (P<0.001). Significantly more mosquitoes were collected using Biogents-sentinel traps in urban than rural areas (P = 0.008) and in western than coastal sites (P = 0.006). The probability of exposure to Ae. aegypti bites was highest in urban areas, outdoors and in the afternoon hours. These characteristics have major implications for the possible transmission of arboviral diseases and for the planning of surveillance and control programs."
https://openalex.org/W2777174589,"Objective To document the psychosocial burden of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) in rural communities in Southeastern Morocco. Method Between March and April 2015, we conducted qualitative research in communities exposed to Leishmania major or L. tropica in Errachidia and Tinghir provinces. Twenty-eight focus groups discussions (FGDs) were realized, with a stratification by gender and tradition of medicine (users of folk versus professional medicine). Data were analyzed using content analysis. Results This rural population most exposed to CL in Morocco lacks access to health care in general and clearly points out there are other major public health issues that need to be resolved. Nonetheless, respondents consider the impact of CL lesions and scars as important and similar to that of burn scar tissue. Young women with CL scars in the face are stigmatized and will often be rejected for marriage in these communities. People usually try a long list of folk remedies on the active lesions, but none was felt adequate. There was a clear demand for better treatment as well as for treatment of the scars. Conclusions The psycho-social impact of CL due to L.major and L.tropica is substantial, especially for young single women with facial scars. These generate social and self-stigma and diminish their marriage prospects. CL is well known, but not considered as a major health priority by these poor rural communities in South-eastern Morocco where gender discrimination is still an issue and access to basic health care is as neglected as CL. Early CL diagnosis and new treatment options with better skin outcomes are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2778276584,"The Yangtze River drainage in China is among the most species rich rivers for freshwater mussels (order Unionida) on Earth with at least 68 species known. The freshwater mussels of the Yangtze River face a variety of threats with indications that species are declining in abundance and area of occupancy. This study represents the first analyses of the genetic structure and diversity for the common and widespread freshwater mussel Nodularia douglasiae based on microsatellite DNA genotypes and mitochondrial DNA sequences. Phylogenetic analysis a fragment of the COI mitochondrial gene indicated that N. douglasiae collected from across the middle and lower Yangtze River drainage are monophyletic with N. douglasiae from Japan, Russia, and South Korea. The results of the analysis of both the mtDNA and microsatellite datasets indicated that the seven collection locations of N. douglasiae in the middle and lower Yangtze River drainage showed high genetic diversity, significant genetic differentiation and genetic structure, and stable population dynamics over time. Moreover, we found that the connections among tributaries rivers and lakes in the Yangtze River drainage were important in maintaining gene flow among locations that N. douglasiae inhabits. An understanding of the genetic structure and diversity of a widespread species like N. douglasiae could be used as a surrogate to better understand the populations of other freshwater mussel species that are more rare in the Yangtze River drainage. At the same time, these results could provide a basis for the protection of genetic diversity and management of unionid mussels diversity and other aquatic organisms in the system."
https://openalex.org/W2776847551,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of fecal donor-unrelated donor mix (FMT-FURM) transplantation as first-line therapy for C. difficile infection (CDI) in intestinal microbiome.We designed an open, two-arm pilot study with oral vancomycin (250mg every 6 h for 10-14 days) or FMT-FURM as treatments for the first CDI episode in hospitalized adult patients in Hospital Universitario ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez"". Patients were randomized by a closed envelope method in a 1: 1 ratio to either oral vancomycin or FMT-FURM. CDI resolution was considered when there was a reduction on the Bristol scale of at least 2 points, a reduction of at least 50% in the number of bowel movements, absence of fever, and resolution of abdominal pain (at least two criteria). From each patient, a fecal sample was obtained at days 0, 3, and 7 after treatment. Specimens were cultured to isolate C. difficile, and isolates were characterized by PCR. Susceptibility testing of isolates was performed using the agar dilution method. Fecal samples and FMT-FURM were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.We included 19 patients; 10 in the vancomycin arm and 9 in the FMT-FURM arm. However, one of the patients in the vancomycin arm and two patients in the FMT-FURM arm were eliminated. Symptoms resolved in 8/9 patients (88.9%) in the vancomycin group, while symptoms resolved in 4/7 patients (57.1%) after the first FMT-FURM dose (P = 0.26) and in 5/7 patients (71.4%) after the second dose (P = 0.55). During the study, no adverse effects attributable to FMT-FURM were observed in patients. Twelve isolates were recovered, most isolates carried tcdB, tcdA, cdtA, and cdtB, with an 18-bp deletion in tcdC. All isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin but susceptible to metronidazole, linezolid, fidaxomicin, and tetracycline. In the FMT-FURM group, the bacterial composition was dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria at all-time points and the microbiota were remarkably stable over time. The vancomycin group showed a very different pattern of the microbial composition when comparing to the FMT-FURM group over time.The results of this preliminary study showed that FMT-FURM for initial CDI is associated with specific bacterial communities that do not resemble the donors' sample."
https://openalex.org/W2778786857,"RNA interference (RNAi) approaches have been applied as a biotechnological tool for controlling plant insect pests via selective gene down regulation. However, the inefficiency of RNAi mechanism in insects is associated with several barriers, including dsRNA delivery and uptake by the cell, dsRNA interaction with the cellular membrane receptor and dsRNA exposure to insect gut nucleases during feeding. The cotton boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis) is a coleopteran in which RNAi-mediated gene silencing does not function efficiently through dsRNA feeding, and the factors involved in the mechanism remain unknown. Herein, we identified three nucleases in the cotton boll weevil transcriptome denoted AgraNuc1, AgraNuc2, and AgraNuc3, and the influences of these nucleases on the gene silencing of A. grandis chitin synthase II (AgraChSII) were evaluated through oral dsRNA feeding trials. A phylogenetic analysis showed that all three nucleases share high similarity with the DNA/RNA non-specific endonuclease family of other insects. These nucleases were found to be mainly expressed in the posterior midgut region of the insect. Two days after nuclease RNAi-mediated gene silencing, dsRNA degradation by the gut juice was substantially reduced. Notably, after nucleases gene silencing, the orally delivered dsRNA against the AgraChSII gene resulted in improved gene silencing efficiency when compared to the control (non-silenced nucleases). The data presented here demonstrates that A. grandis midgut nucleases are effectively one of the main barriers to dsRNA delivery and emphasize the need to develop novel RNAi delivery strategies focusing on protecting the dsRNA from gut nucleases and enhancing its oral delivery and uptake to crop insect pests."
https://openalex.org/W2778784225,"Purpose This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based algorithm for objective classification of the optic disc in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG), using quantitative parameters obtained from ophthalmic examination instruments. Methods This study enrolled 163 eyes of 105 OAG patients (age: 62.3 ± 12.6, mean deviation of Humphrey field analyzer: -8.9 ± 7.5 dB). The eyes were classified into Nicolela’s 4 optic disc types by 3 glaucoma specialists. Randomly, 114 eyes were selected for training data and 49 for test data. A neural network (NN) was trained with the training data and evaluated with the test data. We used 91 types of quantitative data, including 7 patient background characteristics, 48 quantified OCT (swept-source OCT; DRI OCT Atlantis, Topcon) values, including optic disc topography and circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (cpRNFLT), and 36 blood flow parameters from laser speckle flowgraphy, to build the machine learning classification model. To extract the important features among 91 parameters, minimum redundancy maximum relevance and a genetic feature selection were used. Results The validated accuracy against test data for the NN was 87.8% (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.83). The important features in the NN were horizontal disc angle, spherical equivalent, cup area, age, 6-sector superotemporal cpRNFLT, average cup depth, average nasal rim disc ratio, maximum cup depth, and superior-quadrant cpRNFLT. Conclusion The proposed machine learning system has proved to be good identifiers for different disc types with high accuracy. Additionally, the calculated confidence levels reported here should be very helpful for OAG care."
https://openalex.org/W2781106309,"Self-extracellular RNA (eRNA), released from stressed or injured cells upon various pathological situations such as ischemia-reperfusion-injury, has been shown to act as an alarmin by inducing procoagulatory and proinflammatory responses. In particular, M1-polarization of macrophages by eRNA resulted in the expression and release of a variety of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or interleukin-6 (IL-6). The present study now investigates in which way self-eRNA may influence the response of macrophages towards various Toll-like receptor (TLR)-agonists. Isolated agonists of TLR2 (Pam2CSK4), TLR3 (PolyIC), TLR4 (LPS), or TLR7 (R848) induced the release of TNF-α in a concentration-dependent manner in murine macrophages, differentiated from bone marrow-derived stem cells by mouse colony stimulating factor. Here, the presence of eRNA shifted the dose-response curve for Pam2CSK4 (Pam) considerably to the left, indicating that eRNA synergistically enhanced the cytokine liberation from macrophages even at very low Pam-levels. The synergistic activation of TLR2 by eRNA/Pam was duplicated by other TLR2-agonists such as FSL-1 or Pam3CSK4. In contrast, for TLR4-agonists such as LPS a synergistic effect of eRNA was much weaker, and was not existent for TLR3-, or TLR7-agonists. The synergistic eRNA/Pam action was dependent on the NFκB-signaling pathway as well as on p38MAP- and MEK1/ERK-kinases and was prevented by predigestion of eRNA with RNase1 or by antibodies against TLR2. Thus, the presence of self-eRNA as alarming molecule sensitizes innate immune responses towards pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in a synergistic way and may thereby contribute to the differentiated outcome of inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2777053786,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is an inherited childhood ocular cancer caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor RB1 gene. Identification of RB1 mutations is essential to assess the risk of developing retinoblastoma in the patients´ relatives. Retinoblastoma is a potentially curable cancer and an early diagnosis is critical for survival and eye preservation. Unilateral retinoblastoma is mostly non-heritable and results from two somatic mutations whereas bilateral retinoblastoma is heritable and results from one germline and one somatic mutation, both have high penetrance, 90%. The purpose of this study was to identify causative RB1 mutations in RB patients with different clinical presentations. A comprehensive approach was used to study a cohort of 34 patients with unilateral, bilateral and trilateral retinoblastoma. Blood and tumor DNA was analyzed by sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. Validation of an insertion mutation was performed by cloning the PCR product. Most of the patients in our cohort had unilateral RB, eight patients had bilateral RB and one patient had a trilateral tumor with ocular and suprasellar/sellar locations. Other tumors in addition to retinoblastoma were also found in the affected families. One patient had two syndromes, retinoblastoma and schwannomatosis, and another RB patient had a father with a retinoma. Five out of the 25 unilateral RB patients carried germinal mutations (20%), which were mostly missense mutations. The bilateral and trilateral patients carried splice-site, nonsense and frameshift mutations as well as a whole RB1 gene deletion. Missense mutations were associated with mild phenotype: unilateral retinoblastoma, retinoma or no tumor. In this study we identified causative RB1 mutations in most bilateral RB patients and in some unilateral RB patients, including five novel mutations. These data are crucial for genetic counseling and confirm the need to perform complete genetic screening for RB1 mutations in both constitutional and tumor tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2625327153,"The digital traces we leave behind when engaging with the modern world offer an interesting lens through which we study behavioral patterns as expression of gender. Although gender differentiation has been observed in a number of settings, the majority of studies focus on a single data stream in isolation. Here we use a dataset of high resolution data collected using mobile phones, as well as detailed questionnaires, to study gender differences in a large cohort. We consider mobility behavior and individual personality traits among a group of more than 800 university students. We also investigate interactions among them expressed via person-to-person contacts, interactions on online social networks, and telecommunication. Thus, we are able to study the differences between male and female behavior captured through a multitude of channels for a single cohort. We find that while the two genders are similar in a number of aspects, there are robust deviations that include multiple facets of social interactions, suggesting the existence of inherent behavioral differences. Finally, we quantify how aspects of an individual’s characteristics and social behavior reveals their gender by posing it as a classification problem. We ask: How well can we distinguish between male and female study participants based on behavior alone? Which behavioral features are most predictive?"
https://openalex.org/W2778875120,"Background Although a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in old people has been attributed to physiologic aging, it may be associated with kidney disease or superimposed comorbidities. This study aims to assess the prevalence of decreased GFR in a geriatric population in a developing country and its prevalence in the absence of simultaneous diseases. Study design and methods This is a cross-sectional study of data from the Saúde, Bem-Estar e Envelhecimento cohort study (SABE study[Health, Well-Being and Aging]), a multiple cohorts study. A multistage cluster sample composed of 1,253 individuals representative of 1,249,388 inhabitants of São Paulo city aged ≥60 years in 2010 was analyzed. The participants answered a survey on socio-demographic factors and health, had blood pressure measured and urine and blood samples collected. GFR was estimated and defined as decreased when <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Kidney damage was defined as dipstick-positive hematuria or urinary protein:creatinine > 0.20 g/g. Results The prevalence of GFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 was 19.3%. Individuals with GFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 were older (75±1 versus 69±1 years, p<0.001), had lower schooling (18 versus 30% with complete 8-year basic cycle, p = 0.010), and higher prevalence of hypertension (82 versus 63%, p<0.001), diabetes (34 versus 26%, p = 0.021), cardiovascular disease (43 versus 24%, p<0.001) and kidney damage (35% versus 15%, p<0.001). Only 0.7% of the entire studied population had GFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 without simultaneous diseases or kidney damage. Among the individuals with GFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, 3.5% had neither renal damage nor associated comorbidities, whereas among those with GFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2, 11.0% had none of these conditions. Logistic regression showed that older age, cardiovascular disease and hypertension were associated with GFR<60 mL/min/1.73m2. Conclusions Decreased GFR was highly prevalent among the geriatric population in a megalopolis of a developing country. It was rarely present without simultaneous chronic comorbidities or kidney damage."
https://openalex.org/W2777632310,"Flowering in plants is synchronized by both environmental cues and internal regulatory factors. Previous studies have shown that the endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica promotes the growth and early flowering in Coleus forskohlii (a medicinal plant) and Arabidopsis. To further dissect the impact of P. indica on pathways responsible for flowering time in Arabidopsis, we co-cultivated Arabidopsis with P. indica and used RT-qPCR to analyze the main gene regulation networks involved in flowering. Our results revealed that the symbiotic interaction of Arabidopsis with P. indica promotes early flower development and the number of siliques. In addition, expression of the core flowering regulatory gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), of genes controlling the photoperiod [CRYPTOCHROMES (CRY1, CRY2) and PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB)] and those related to gibberellin (GA) functions (RGA1, AGL24, GA3, and MYB5) were induced by the fungus, while key genes controlling the age and autonomous pathways remained unchanged. Moreover, early flowering promotion conferred by P. indica was promoted by exogenous GA and inhabited by GA inhibitor, and this effect could be observed under long day and neutral day photoperiod. Therefore, our data suggested that P. indica promotes early flowering in Arabidopsis likely through photoperiod and GA rather than age or the autonomous pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2778260572,"Neuroinflammation is potentiated by early degeneration of the locus coeruleus noradrenergic pathway (LC-NE) commonly seen in aging-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. In animal models, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces strong peripheral immune responses that can cause cognitive changes secondary to neuroinflammation. The influence of the peripheral immune response on cognition might be exacerbated by LC-NE degeneration, but this has not been well characterized previously. In this study, we investigated how systemic inflammation affects neuroinflammation and cognition in aged rats that have had either normal or damaged LC-NE transmitter systems. Rats were first exposed to the selective noradrenergic (NE) neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4) to induce degeneration of central NE pathways. Two weeks later, the rats received a low dose of LPS. This resulted in 3 treatment groups (Control, LPS-, and DSP4+LPS-treated rats) studied at 4 hours (short-term subgroup) and 7 days (long-term subgroup) following the LPS injection. DSP4+LPS-treated rats exhibited increased serum levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased astroglial and microglial activation in the hippocampus, and poorer performance in the novel object recognition task (NORT) compared to controls and LPS-treated rats. Additionally, serum and brain tissue levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were modulated over time in the DSP4+LPS group compared to the other two groups. Specifically, DSP4+LPS-treated rats in the short-term subgroup had lower hippocampal BDNF levels (~25%) than controls and LPS-treated rats, which negatively correlated with hippocampal astrogliosis and positively correlated with hippocampal IL-1β levels. Serum and hippocampal BDNF levels in the DSP4+LPS-treated rats in the long-term subgroup returned to levels similar to the control group. These results show that systemic inflammation in LC-NE-lesioned aged rats promotes an exacerbated systemic and central inflammatory response compared to LC-NE-intact rats and alters BDNF levels, indicating the important role of this neurotransmitter system in response to neuroinflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2781105556,"Objectives To compare physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across four systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD). Methods Incident subjects enrolled in four SARD cohorts, namely systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) were studied. The outcomes of interest were baseline Short Form Health Survey physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores. Multivariate analysis was conducted to determine whether PCS and MCS scores differed across SARD type. Results The study included 118 SLE (93% women, mean age 36 years), 108 SSc (79% women, mean age 55), 64 RA (63% women, mean age 58) and 25 IIM (68% women, mean age 49) subjects. Mean PCS scores were 38.9 ± 12.2 in SLE, 37.1 ± 13.3 in RA, 35.0 ± 13.6 in SSc and 28.0 ± 15.4 in IIM. Mean MCS scores were 45.0 ± 13.3 in RA, 44.4 ± 14.7 in SSc, 40.1 ± 14.3 in SLE and 33.6 ± 18.7 in IIM. SARD type was an independent predictor of HRQoL with, in some cases, the magnitude of the differences reaching one standard deviation (IIM worse PCS scores compared to SLE (β -12.23 [95% CI -18.11, -6.36; p<0.001]); IIM worse MCS scores compared to SSc (β -11.05 [95% CI -17.53, -4.58; p = 0.001]) and RA (β -11.72 [95% CI -18.62, -4.81; p = 0.001]). Conclusions Cross-SARD research provides a novel approach to gain greater understanding of commonalities and differences across rheumatic diseases. The differences observed warrant further research into correlates and trajectories over time."
https://openalex.org/W2777625534,"Male sexual differentiation in crustaceans is controlled by the androgenic gland (AG), a unique male endocrine organ that, in decapods, is located at the base of the 5th pereiopod. In these animals, the insulin-like androgenic gland hormone (IAG) is the major factor secreted from the AG to induce masculinization and maintain male characteristics. It has, however, recently been proposed that this hormone also plays a role in growth and ovarian development in females. In this study, we tested such a possibility by searching for the IAG gene in the marbled crayfish, a parthenogenetic animal that reproduces asexually to form an all-female genetic clone. Based on the phylogenetic relationship between the marbled crayfish and Procambarus fallax, a gonochoristic species of the same North American Cambaridae family, we searched for the IAG gene in the marbled crayfish and then fully sequenced it. The open reading frame of the gene was found to be completely identical in the two species, and their introns shared over 94% identity. It was also found that, in addition to its expression at the base of the 5th pereiopod and in the testes of male P. fallax crayfish, IAG was expressed in the muscle tissue of P. fallax males and females and even of the parthenogenetic marbled crayfish. These findings provide new insight into possible functions of IAG, in addition to its role as a masculinization-inducing factor, and also constitute the basis for a discussion of the evolutionary relationship between the above two species."
https://openalex.org/W2780773831,"We explored whether and how the exposure to a natural disaster such as the 2012 Emilia Romagna earthquake affected the development of children's emotional competence in terms of understanding, regulating, and expressing emotions, after two years, when compared with a control group not exposed to the earthquake. We also examined the role of class level and gender.The sample included two groups of children (n = 127) attending primary school: The experimental group (n = 65) experienced the 2012 Emilia Romagna earthquake, while the control group (n = 62) did not. The data collection took place two years after the earthquake, when children were seven or ten-year-olds. Beyond assessing the children's understanding of emotions and regulating abilities with standardized instruments, we employed semi-structured interviews to explore their knowledge of earthquakes and associated emotions, and a structured task on the intensity of some target emotions.We applied Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Exposure to the earthquake did not influence the understanding and regulation of emotions. The understanding of emotions varied according to class level and gender. Knowledge of earthquakes, emotional language, and emotions associated with earthquakes were, respectively, more complex, frequent, and intense for children who had experienced the earthquake, and at increasing ages.Our data extend the generalizability of theoretical models on children's psychological functioning following disasters, such as the dose-response model and the organizational-developmental model for child resilience, and provide further knowledge on children's emotional resources related to natural disasters, as a basis for planning educational prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2780081733,"Water contamination by heavy metals from industrial activities is a serious environmental concern. To mitigate heavy metal toxicity and to recover heavy metals for recycling, biomaterials used in phytoremediation and bio-sorbent filtration have recently drawn renewed attention. The filamentous protonemal cells of the moss Funaria hygrometrica can hyperaccumulate lead (Pb) up to 74% of their dry weight when exposed to solutions containing divalent Pb. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed that Pb is localized to the cell walls, endoplasmic reticulum-like membrane structures, and chloroplast thylakoids, suggesting that multiple Pb retention mechanisms are operating in living F. hygrometrica. The main Pb-accumulating compartment was the cell wall, and prepared cell-wall fractions could also adsorb Pb. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis showed that polysaccharides composed of polygalacturonic acid and cellulose probably serve as the most effective Pb-binding components. The adsorption abilities were retained throughout a wide range of pH values, and bound Pb was not desorbed under conditions of high ionic strength. In addition, the moss is highly tolerant to Pb. These results suggest that the moss F. hygrometrica could be a useful tool for the mitigation of Pb-toxicity in wastewater."
https://openalex.org/W2776902138,"Buckwheat is an important minor crop with pharmaceutical functions due to rutin enrichment in the seed. Seeds of common buckwheat cultivars (Fagopyrum esculentum, Fes) usually have much lower rutin content than tartary buckwheat (F. tartaricum, Ft). We previously found a wild species of common buckwheat (F. esculentum ssp. ancestrale, Fea), with seeds that are high in rutin, similar to Ft. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which rutin production varies among different buckwheat cultivars, Fea, a Ft variety (Xide) and a Fes variety (No.2 Pingqiao) using RNA sequencing of filling stage seeds. Sequencing data generated approximately 43.78-Gb of clean bases, all these data were pooled together and assembled 180,568 transcripts, and 109,952 unigenes. We established seed gene expression profiles of each buckwheat sample and assessed genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, storage proteins production, CYP450 family, starch and sucrose metabolism, and transcription factors. Differentially expressed genes between Fea and Fes were further analyzed due to their close relationship than with Ft. Expression levels of flavonoid biosynthesis gene FLS1 (Flavonol synthase 1) were similar in Fea and Ft, and much higher than in Fes, which was validated by qRT-PCR. This suggests that FLS1 transcript levels may be associated with rutin accumulation in filling stage seeds of buckwheat species. Further, we explored transcription factors by iTAK, and multiple gene families were identified as being involved in the coordinate regulation of metabolism and development. Our extensive transcriptomic data sets provide a complete description of metabolically related genes that are differentially expressed in filling stage buckwheat seeds and suggests that FLS1 is a key controller of rutin synthesis in buckwheat species. FLS1 can effectively convert dihydroflavonoids into flavonol products. These findings provide a basis for further studies of flavonoid biosynthesis in buckwheat breeding to help accelerate flavonoid metabolic engineering that would increase rutin content in cultivars of common buckwheat."

In this context, in vitro dynamic systems to simulate human digestion and, in particular, infant digestion could become increasingly valuable. Objective To simulate the digestive process through the use of a dynamic model of the infant gastroenteric apparatus to study the digestibility of starch-based infant foods. Design Using M.I.D.A (Model of an Infant Digestive Apparatus), the oral, gastric and intestinal digestibility of two starch-based products were measured: 1) rice starch mixed with distilled water and treated using two different sterilization methods (the classical method with a holding temperature of 121°C for 37 min and the HTST method with a holding temperature of 137°C for 70 sec) and 2) a rice cream with (premium product) or without (basic product) an aliquot of rice flour fermented by Lactobacillus paracasei CBA L74. After the digestion the foods were analyzed for the starch concentration, the amount of D-glucose released and the percentage of hydrolyzed starch. Results An in vitro dynamic system, which was referred to as M.I.D.A., was obtained. Using this system, the starch digestion occurred only during the oral and intestinal phase, as expected. The D-glucose released during the intestinal phase was different between the classical and HTST methods (0.795 grams for the HTST versus 0.512 for the classical product). The same analysis was performed for the basic and premium products. In this case, the premium product had a significant difference in terms of the starch hydrolysis percentage during the entire process. Conclusions The M.I.D.A. system was able to digest simple starches and a more complex food in the correct compartments. In this study, better digestibility of the premium product was revealed."
https://openalex.org/W2781104737,"Interactions between trees and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are critical for the growth and survival of both partners. However, ECM symbiosis in endangered trees has hardly been explored, complicating conservation efforts. Here, we evaluated resident ECM roots and soil spore banks of ECM fungi from endangered Pinus amamiana forests on Yakushima and Tanegashima Islands, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. Soil samples were collected from remaining four forests in the two islands. The resident ECM roots in soil samples were subjected to molecular identification. Soil spore banks of ECM fungi were analyzed via bioassays using a range of host seedlings (P. amamiana, P. parviflora, P. densiflora and Castanopsis sieboldii) for 6–8 months. In all remaining P. amamiana forests, we discovered a new Rhizopogon species (Rhizopogon sp.1), the sequence of which has no match amoung numerous Rhizopogon sequences deposited in the international sequence database. Host identification of the resident ECM roots confirmed that Rhizopogon sp.1 was associated only with P. amamiana. Rhizopogon sp.1 was far more dominant in soil spore banks than in resident ECM roots, and its presence was confirmed in nearly all soil samples examined across the major remaining populations. While Rhizopogon sp.1 did not completely lose compatibility to other pine species, its infection rate in the bioassays was highest in the original host, P. amamiana, the performance of which was improved by the infection. These results indicate that Rhizopogon sp.1 is very likely to have a close ecological relationship with endangered P. amamiana, probably due to a long co-evolutionary period on isolated islands, and to play the key role in seedling establishment after disturbance. We may need to identify and utilize such key ECM fungi to conserve endangered trees practically."
https://openalex.org/W2777553402,"Trains with different numbers of cars running in the open air were simulated using the delayed detached-eddy simulation (DDES). The numbers of cars included in the simulation are 3, 4, 5 and 8. The aim of this study was to investigate how train length influences the boundary layer, the wake flow, the surface pressure, the aerodynamic drag and the friction drag. To certify the accuracy of the mesh and methods, the drag coefficients from numerical simulation of trains with 3 cars were compared with those from the wind tunnel test, and agreement was obtained. The results show that the boundary layer is thicker and the wake vortices are less symmetric as the train length increases. As a result, train length greatly affects pressure. The upper surface pressure of the tail car reduced by 2.9%, the side surface pressure of the tail car reduced by 8.3% and the underneath surface pressure of the tail car reduced by 19.7% in trains that included 3 cars to those including 8 cars. In addition, train length also has a significant effect on the friction drag coefficient and the drag coefficient. The friction drag coefficient of each car in a configuration decreases along the length of the train. In a comparison between trains consisting of 3 cars to those consisting of 8 cars, the friction drag coefficient of the tail car reduced by 8.6% and the drag coefficient of the tail car reduced by 3.7%."
https://openalex.org/W2779995209,"European honey bees (Apis mellifera) are critically important to global food production by virtue of their pollination services but are severely threatened by deformed wing virus (DWV) especially in the presence of the external parasite Varroa destructor. DWV exists as many viral strains with the two major variants (DWV-A and DWV-B) varying in virulence. A single plasmid standard was constructed containing three sections for the specific determination of DWV-A (VP2 capsid region), DWV-B (IRES) and a conserved region suitable for total DWV (helicase region). The assays were confirmed as specific and discriminatory with limits of detections of 25, 25 and 50 genome equivalents for DWV-A, DWV-B and total-DWV, respectively. The methods were successfully tested on Apis mellifera and V. destructor samples with varying DWV profiles. The new method determined a more accurate total DWV titre in samples with substantial DWV-B than the method currently described in the COLOSS Beebook. The proposed assays could be utilized for the screening of large quantities of bee material for both a total DWV load overview along with more detailed investigations into DWV-A and DWV-B profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2781338397,"Birth weight, length and circumferences of the head, chest and arm are key measures of newborn size and health in developing countries. We assessed maternal socio-demographic factors associated with multiple measures of newborn size in a large rural population in Bangladesh using partial least squares (PLS) regression method. PLS regression, combining features from principal component analysis and multiple linear regression, is a multivariate technique with an ability to handle multicollinearity while simultaneously handling multiple dependent variables. We analyzed maternal and infant data from singletons (n = 14,506) born during a double-masked, cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled maternal vitamin A or β-carotene supplementation trial in rural northwest Bangladesh. PLS regression results identified numerous maternal factors (parity, age, early pregnancy MUAC, living standard index, years of education, number of antenatal care visits, preterm delivery and infant sex) significantly (p<0.001) associated with newborn size. Among them, preterm delivery had the largest negative influence on newborn size (Standardized β = -0.29 - -0.19; p<0.001). Scatter plots of the scores of first two PLS components also revealed an interaction between newborn sex and preterm delivery on birth size. PLS regression was found to be more parsimonious than both ordinary least squares regression and principal component regression. It also provided more stable estimates than the ordinary least squares regression and provided the effect measure of the covariates with greater accuracy as it accounts for the correlation among the covariates and outcomes. Therefore, PLS regression is recommended when either there are multiple outcome measurements in the same study, or the covariates are correlated, or both situations exist in a dataset."
https://openalex.org/W2950399121,"Tumor molecular profiling plays an integral role in identifying genomic anomalies which may help in personalizing cancer treatments, improving patient outcomes and minimizing risks associated with different therapies. However, critical information regarding the evidence of clinical utility of such anomalies is largely buried in biomedical literature. It is becoming prohibitive for biocurators, clinical researchers and oncologists to keep up with the rapidly growing volume and breadth of information, especially those that describe therapeutic implications of biomarkers and therefore relevant for treatment selection. In an effort to improve and speed up the process of manually reviewing and extracting relevant information from literature, we have developed a natural language processing (NLP)-based text mining (TM) system called eGARD (extracting Genomic Anomalies association with Response to Drugs). This system relies on the syntactic nature of sentences coupled with various textual features to extract relations between genomic anomalies and drug response from MEDLINE abstracts. Our system achieved high precision, recall and F-measure of up to 0.95, 0.86 and 0.90, respectively, on annotated evaluation datasets created in-house and obtained externally from PharmGKB. Additionally, the system extracted information that helps determine the confidence level of extraction to support prioritization of curation. Such a system will enable clinical researchers to explore the use of published markers to stratify patients upfront for ‘best-fit’ therapies and readily generate hypotheses for new clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2776159693,"Johne's Disease (JD), caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), results in significant economic loss to livestock production. The early detection of MAP infection in animals with extant serological assays has remained challenging due to the low sensitivity of commercially available ELISA tests, a fact that has hampered the development of effective JD control programs. Our recent protein microarray-based studies identified several promising candidate antigens that are immunogenic during different stages of MAP infection. To evaluate these antigens for use in diagnostic assays and reliably identify animals with MAP infection, a multiplex (Luminex®) assay was developed using color-coded flourescent beads coupled to 6 MAP recombinant proteins and applied to screen 180 serum and 90 milk samples from cows at different stages of MAP infection including negative (NL), fecal test positive/ELISA negative (F+E-), and fecal positive/ELISA positive (F+E+). The results show that while serum antibody reactivities to each of the 6 antigens were highest in F+E+ group, antibody reactivity to three of the six antigens were identified in the F+E- group, suggesting that these three antigens are expressed and provoke antibody responses during the early infection stages with MAP. Further, antibodies against all six antigens were elevated in milk samples from both the F+E- and F+E+ groups in comparison to the NL group (p<0.01). Taken together, the results of our investigation suggest that multiplex bead-based assays are able to reliably identify MAP infection, even during early stages when antibody responses in animals are undetectable with widely used commercial ELISA tests."
https://openalex.org/W2779275965,"Protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in biological processes such as cell-cell adhesion, immune system-pathogen interactions, and sensory perception. Understanding the structural determinants of protein-protein complex formation and obtaining quantitative estimates of their dissociation constant (KD) are essential for the study of these interactions and for the discovery of new therapeutics. At the same time, it is equally important to characterize protein-protein interactions in a high-throughput fashion. Here, we use a modified thermal scanning assay to test interactions of wild type (WT) and mutant variants of N-terminal fragments (EC1+2) of cadherin-23 and protocadherin-15, two proteins essential for inner-ear mechanotransduction. An environmentally sensitive fluorescent dye (SYPRO orange) is used to monitor melting temperature (Tm) shifts of protocadherin-15 EC1+2 (pcdh15) in the presence of increasing concentrations of cadherin-23 EC1+2 (cdh23). These Tm shifts are absent when we use proteins containing deafness-related missense mutations known to disrupt cdh23 binding to pcdh15, and are increased for some rationally designed mutants expected to enhance binding. In addition, surface plasmon resonance binding experiments were used to test if the Tm shifts correlated with changes in binding affinity. We used this approach to find a double mutation (cdh23(T15E)- pcdh15(G16D)) that enhances binding affinity of the cadherin complex by 1.98 kJ/mol, roughly two-fold that of the WT complex. We suggest that the thermal scanning methodology can be used in high-throughput format to quickly compare binding affinities (KD from nM up to 100 μM) for some heterodimeric protein complexes and to screen small molecule libraries to find protein-protein interaction inhibitors and enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W2779925921,"A crossdated, replicated, chronology of 114 years (1901–2014) was developed from internal growth increments in the shells of Glycymeris glycymeris samples collected monthly from the Bay of Brest, France. Bivalve sampling was undertaken between 2014 and 2015 using a dredge. In total 401 live specimens and 243 articulated paired valves from dead specimens were collected, of which 38 individuals were used to build the chronology. Chronology strength, assessed as the Expressed Population Signal, was above 0.7 throughout, falling below the generally accepted threshold of 0.85 before 1975 because of reduced sample depth. Significant positive correlations were identified between the shell growth and the annual averages of rainfall (1975–2008; r = 0.34) and inflow from the river Elorn (1989–2009; r = 0.60). A significant negative correlation was identified between shell growth and the annual average salinity (1998–2014; r = -0.62). Analysis of the monthly averages indicates that these correlations are associated with the winter months (November–February) preceding the G. glycymeris growth season suggesting that winter conditions predispose the benthic environment for later shell growth. Concentration of suspended particulate matter within the river in February is also positively correlated with shell growth, leading to the conclusion that food availability is also important to the growth of G. glycymeris in the Bay of Brest. With the addition of principle components analysis, we were able to determine that inflow from the River Elorn, nitrite levels and salinity were the fundamental drivers of G. glycymeris growth and that these environmental parameters were all linked."
https://openalex.org/W2780951041,"Maintenance of reduced body weight is associated both with reduced energy expenditure per unit metabolic mass and increased hunger in mice and humans. Lowered circulating leptin concentration, due to decreased fat mass, provides a primary signal for this response. However, leptin deficient (Lepob/ob) mice (and leptin receptor deficient Zucker rats) reduce energy expenditure following weight reduction by a necessarily non-leptin dependent mechanisms. To identify these mechanisms, Lepob/ob mice were fed ad libitum (AL group; n = 21) or restricted to 3 kilocalories of chow per day (CR group, n = 21). After losing 20% of initial weight (in approximately 2 weeks), the CR mice were stabilized at 80% of initial body weight for two weeks by titrated refeeding, and then released from food restriction. CR mice conserved energy (-17% below predicted based on body mass and composition during the day; -52% at night); and, when released to ad libitum feeding, CR mice regained fat and lean mass (to AL levels) within 5 weeks. CR mice did so while their ad libitum caloric intake was equal to that of the AL animals. While calorically restricted, the CR mice had a significantly lower respiratory exchange ratio (RER = 0.89) compared to AL (0.94); after release to ad libitum feeding, RER was significantly higher (1.03) than in the AL group (0.93), consistent with their anabolic state. These results confirm that, in congenitally leptin deficient animals, leptin is not required for compensatory reduction in energy expenditure accompanying weight loss, but suggest that the hyperphagia of the weight-reduced state is leptin-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2776425997,"Giardia intestinalis, a cosmopolitan zoonotic parasite, is one of the most common causes of protozoal diarrhea in both humans and animals worldwide. Although G. intestinalis has been detected in many animals, information regarding its prevalence and genotype in Chinese racehorses is scarce. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of G. intestinalis in racehorses and performed molecular characterization of the pathogen to assess its zoonotic potential. Two hundred and sixty-four racehorse fecal samples from six equestrian clubs located in different regions of the Sichuan province of southwestern China were examined. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the gene encoding triose-phosphate isomerase (tpi) showed the prevalence of G. intestinalis to be 8.3% (22/264), and the prevalence in different clubs varied from 3.6% to 13.5%. Three assemblages were identified in the successfully sequenced samples, including the potentially zoonotic assemblages A (n = 5) and B (n = 14), the mouse-specific assemblage G (n = 3), and a mixed A and B assemblage. Sequence analysis of tpi, glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and beta giardin (bg) loci revealed that the majority of sequences isolated from assemblage A were identical to the subtype AIV and assemblage B isolates showed variability among the nucleotide sequences of the subtype BIV. Using the nomenclature for the multilocus genotype (MLG) model, one each of multilocus genotypes A (MLG1) and B (MLG2) were identified, with MLG2 being a novel genotype. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate G. intestinalis in Chinese racehorses. The presence of both animal and human assemblages of G. intestinalis in racehorses indicated that these animals might constitute a potential zoonotic risk to human beings."

A One Health approach is needed to understand, prevent, and control toxoplasmosis, while knowledge gaps in the One Health aspects have been identified among medical professionals in earlier studies. As a One Health collaboration between veterinary and medical fields, we surveyed the knowledge on toxoplasmosis among medical doctors in Nigeria. The knowledge questions, which the participants answered without consulting literature and colleagues, covered epidemiological One Health aspects as well as clinical interspecialty aspects of T. gondii infections. Altogether 522 medical doctors from four tertiary hospitals completed the questionnaire. The mean number of correct answers in the knowledge questions was 7.5, and 8.4% of the participants selected at least 12 of the 17 correct answers. The proportion of medical doctors scoring such a high score was significantly higher among those who reported having seen a case of clinical toxoplasmosis than in those who did not. While 62% of the medical doctors participating in our study knew that cats can shed T. gondii in their feces, 36% incorrectly suggested that humans could do that too. That T. gondii infection can be meatborne was known by 69%, but that it can be also waterborne only by 28% of the medical doctors participating in our study. Most of the medical doctors, 78%, knew that clinical toxoplasmosis may involve the central nervous system, while only 37% answered that it can involve the eyes. Our results suggested knowledge gaps, which need to be addressed in Continuous Medical Education. The identified gaps included both intersectoral One Health aspects and interspecialty aspects: For prevention and management of toxoplasmosis, knowing the main transmission routes and that the parasite can affect several organs is relevant."

In this paper we aim to show in a practical and didactic way how to calculate the Malliavin derivative, the derivative of the expectation of a quantity of interest of a model with respect to its underlying stochastic parameters, for four problems found in mechanics. The non-intrusive approach uses the Malliavin Weight Sampling (MWS) method in conjunction with a standard Monte Carlo method. The models are expressed as ODEs or PDEs and discretised using the finite difference or finite element methods. Specifically, we consider stochastic extensions of; a 1D Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic model discretised with finite differences, a 1D linear elastic bar, a hyperelastic bar undergoing buckling, and incompressible Navier-Stokes flow around a cylinder, all discretised with finite elements. A further contribution of this paper is an extension of the MWS method to the more difficult case of non-Gaussian random variables and the calculation of second-order derivatives.

https://openalex.org/W2778444287,"We analyzed the diet of Baird’s Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) and Grasshopper Sparrow (A. savannarum) in three different sites and sampling periods across the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. DNA from seeds in regurgitated stomach contents was sequenced using NGS technology and identified with a barcoding approach using the P6 loop of the trnL intron as genetic marker. During each sampling period, we collected random soil samples to estimate seed availability in the soil seed bank. Due to the variability and size of the genetic marker, the resolution was limited to a family level resolution for taxonomic classification of seeds, but in several cases a genus level was achieved. Diets contained a high diversity of seeds but were dominated by a limited number of genera/families. Seeds from Panicoideae (from the genera Panicum, Setaria, Eriochloa, Botriochloa, and Hackelochloa) contributed for the largest part to the diets (53 ± 19%), followed by Bouteloua (10 ± 12%). Depending on the site and sampling period, other important seeds in the diets were Eragrostideae, Pleuraphis, Asteraceae, Verbena, and Amaranthus. The most abundant seeds were not always preferred. Aristida and Chloris were common in the soil seed bank but these seeds were avoided by both bird species. Baird’s and Grasshopper sparrows did not differ in seed preferences. This work highlights the importance of range management practices that favor seed production of Panicoideae and Bouteloua grasses to enhance winter habitat use and survival of Baird’s and Grasshopper sparrows in the Chihuahuan Desert."

We analyzed the transmission route and aimed to control the outbreak. Methods The transmission route was investigated by nasal screening for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-producing Staphylococcus aureus (PVL-SA), subsequent microbiological investigation including whole genome sequencing and a questionnaire-based analysis of epidemiological information. The control measures included distribution of outbreak information to all individuals at risk and implementation of a Staphylococcus aureus decontamination protocol. Results Individuals from 7 of 19 families were either colonized or showed signs of SSTI such as massive abscesses or eye lid infections. We found 10 PVL-SA isolates in 9 individuals. In the WGS-analysis all isolates were found identical with a maximum of 17 allele difference. The clones were methicillin-susceptible but cotrimoxazole resistant. In comparison to PVL-SAs from an international strain collection, the outbreak clone showed close genetical relatedness to PVL-SAs from a non-European country. The questionnaire results showed frequent travels of one family to this area. The results also demonstrated likely transmission via direct contact between families. After initiation of Staphylococcus aureus decontamination no further case was detected. Conclusions Our outbreak investigation showed the introduction of a PVL-SA strain into a kindergarten likely as a result of international travel and further transmission by direct contact. The implementation of a Staphylococcus aureus decontamination protocol was able to control the outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W2780236396,"The currently known protein sequences are not distributed equally in sequence space, but cluster into families. Analyzing the cluster size distribution gives a glimpse of the large and unknown extant protein sequence space, which has been explored during evolution. For six protein superfamilies with different fold and function, the cluster size distributions followed a power law with slopes between 2.4 and 3.3, which represent upper limits to the cluster distribution of extant sequences. The power law distribution of cluster sizes is in accordance with percolation theory and strongly supports connectedness of extant sequence space. Percolation of extant sequence space has three major consequences: (1) It transforms our view of sequence space as a highly connected network where each sequence has multiple neighbors, and each pair of sequences is connected by many different paths. A high degree of connectedness is a necessary condition of efficient evolution, because it overcomes the possible blockage by sign epistasis and reciprocal sign epistasis. (2) The Fisher exponent is an indicator of connectedness and saturation of sequence space of each protein superfamily. (3) All clusters are expected to be connected by extant sequences that become apparent as a higher portion of extant sequence space becomes known. Being linked to biochemically distinct homologous families, bridging sequences are promising enzyme candidates for applications in biotechnology because they are expected to have substrate ambiguity or catalytic promiscuity."

The aim of the study was to track changes in adiponectin levels in response to weight gain and to assess associations between adiponectin and psychological aspects in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN).To investigate if adiponectin levels depend on AN severity, data were assessed from 11 inpatients with a very low body mass index (BMI) and a high chronicity (high severity group; HSS), and nine with less severe symptoms (LSS). During the course of treatment, serum adiponectin concentrations were assessed on a weekly basis along with BMI. Psychological variables (i.e., depression, anxiety, stress, and AN-specific symptoms) were obtained by means of electronic diaries. Longitudinal regressions and correlations were calculated to evaluate the temporal course of adiponectin and its relationship with psychological self-ratings.At the beginning adiponectin was not increased in HSS patients (p = .56), and only marginally elevated in LSS patients (p = 0.07) compared with controls. In HSS patients, adiponectin increased along with BMI during the first treatment phase (i.e., when the BMI of patients was below 16 kg/m2) and thereafter decreased with further weight gain. In LSS patients, adiponectin was not associated with BMI increase. Furthermore, adiponectin was strongly negatively correlated with psychological self-ratings when the BMI of patients was above 16 kg/m2, i.e., higher levels of adiponectin were related to lower ratings of depression, anxiety, and AN-specific symptoms.The study connects previous varying results by indicating that the course of adiponectin is dependent on BMI and symptom severity. Similarly, associations of adiponectin and psychological health depended on BMI."

We demonstrate the utility of measuring FEV1 dynamics in representative cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) populations.Individual FEV1 data from CF and COPD subjects were modeled by estimating median regression splines and their predicted first and second derivatives. Classes were created from variables that capture the dynamics of these curves in both cohorts.Nine FEV1 dynamic variables were identified from the splines and their predicted derivatives in individuals with CF (n = 177) and COPD (n = 374). Three FEV1 dynamic classes (i.e. stable, intermediate and hypervariable) were generated and described using these variables from both cohorts. In the CF cohort, the FEV1 hypervariable class (HV) was associated with a clinically unstable, female-dominated phenotypes while stable FEV1 class (S) individuals were highly associated with the male-dominated milder clinical phenotype. In the COPD cohort, associations were found between the FEV1 dynamic classes, the COPD GOLD grades, with exacerbation frequency and symptoms.Nonlinear modeling of FEV1 with splines provides new insights and is useful in characterizing CF and COPD clinical phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2776718327,"Introduction To examine (1) what individuals know about the existing adult preventive service coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and (2) which preventive services individuals think should be covered without cost sharing. Methods An online panel from Survey Monkey was used to obtain a sample of 2,990 adults age 18 and older in March 2015, analyzed 2015–2017. A 17-item survey instrument was designed and used to evaluate respondents’ knowledge of the adult preventive services provision of the ACA. Additionally, we asked whether various preventive services should be covered. The data include age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment as well as measures of political ideology, previous insurance status, the number of chronic conditions, and usual source of care. Results Respondents correctly answered 38.6% of the questions about existing coverage under the ACA, while on average respondents thought 12.1 of 15 preventive services should be covered (SD 3.5). Respondents were more knowledgeable about coverage for routine screenings, such as blood pressure (63.4% correct) than potentially stigmatizing screenings, such as for alcohol misuse (28.8% correct). Blood pressure screening received the highest support of coverage (89.8%) while coverage of gym memberships received the lowest support (59.4%). Individuals with conservative ideologies thought fewer services on average should be covered, but the difference was small—around one service less than those with liberal ideologies. Conclusions Overwhelmingly, individuals think that most preventive services should be covered without cost sharing. Despite several years of coverage for preventive services, there is still confusion and lack of knowledge about which services are covered."
https://openalex.org/W2776075738,"Introduction The increasing prevalence of multi-resistant bacteria is a major public health concern. Infections acquired during ophthalmic surgery are devastating. The purpose of the current study is to compare the proportion of eyes with negative bacterial cultures on all tested media after 1 versus 3 sequential drops of povidone-iodine (PI) 5% into the inferior conjunctival fornix. Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 (PI group) drop (at time 28 minutes) or 3 (PI plus group) sequential drops (at time 0, 20 minutes and 28 minutes) of PI 5% into the inferior conjunctival sac of one randomly selected eye. A swab culture was obtained from the inferior conjunctival fornix 5 minutes before and 30 minutes after time 0. Central corneal thickness (CCT) was measured shortly before time 0 and shortly after time 30. Conjunctival swabs were incubated aerobically in enriched Thioglycolate liquid medium (meat broth) and in three solid culture media (chocolate agar, trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood, and Sabouraud agar). Results There was no significant difference in the proportion of negative cultures after intervention between groups (p = 0.1638). Also in the PI group (n = 59), the proportion of eyes with negative cultures after PI (79.7%) did not differ significantly from baseline (76.3%; p = 0.7539). However in the PI plus group (n = 61), the proportion of eyes with all negative cultures after PI (85.3%) was significantly higher than before PI (70.5%) (p = 0.0177). There was no significant difference in mean CCT before and after the intervention in both groups. Conclusion Instillation of 3 sequential drops of PI was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of eyes with all negative cultures, while instillation of a single drop of PI was not associated with a significant increase in the proportion of negative cultures. Further study is warranted to determine whether the difference between the PI administration regimens is also associated with differences in the rates of postoperative ocular infections."
https://openalex.org/W2776704470,"Social insects recognize their nestmates by means of a cuticular hydrocarbon signature shared by colony members, but how nest signature changes across time has been rarely tested in longitudinal studies and in the field. In social wasps, the chemical signature is also deposited on the nest surface, where it is used by newly emerged wasps as a reference to learn their colony odor. Here, we investigate the temporal variations of the chemical signature that wasps have deposited on their nests. We followed the fate of the colonies of the social paper wasp Polistes biglumis in their natural environment from colony foundation to decline. Because some colonies were invaded by the social parasite Polistes atrimandibularis, we also tested the effects of social parasites on the nest signature. We observed that, as the season progresses, the nest signature changed; the overall abundance of hydrocarbons as well as the proportion of longer-chain and branched hydrocarbons increased. Where present, social parasites altered the host-nest signature qualitatively (adding parasite-specific alkenes) and quantitatively (by interfering with the increase in overall hydrocarbon abundance). Our results show that 1) colony odor is highly dynamic both in colonies controlled by legitimate foundresses and in those controlled by social parasites; 2) emerged offspring contribute little to colony signature, if at all, in comparison to foundresses; and 3) social parasites, that later mimic host signature, initially mark host nests with species-specific hydrocarbons. This study implies that important updating of the neural template used in nestmate recognition should occur in social insects."
https://openalex.org/W2778090562,"RNase E has a pivotal role in the degradation and processing of RNAs in Escherichia coli, and protein inhibitors RraA and RraB control its enzymatic activity. The halophilic pathogenic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus also expresses orthologs of RNase E and RraA-RNase EV, RraAV1, and RraAV2 (herein renamed as VvRNase E, VvRraA1, and VvRraA2). A previous study showed that VvRraA1 actively inhibits the ribonucleolytic activity of VvRNase E by interacting with the C-terminal region of VvRNase E. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of VvRraA1 on the ribonucleolytic activity of VvRNase E has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we report that the oligomer formation of VvRraA proteins affects binding efficiency to VvRNase E as well as inhibitory activity on VvRNase E action. The hexameric structure of VvRraA1 was converted to lower oligomeric forms when the Cys 9 residue was substituted with an Asp residue (VvRraA1-C9D), showing decreased inhibitory activity of VvRraA1 on VvRNase E in vivo. These results indicated that the intermolecular disulfide linkage contributed critically to the hexamerization of VvRraA1 for its proper function. On the contrary, the VvRraA2 that existed in a trimeric state did not bind to or inhibit VvRNase E. An in vitro cleavage assay further showed the reduced inhibitory effect of VvRraA-C9D on VvRNase E activity compared to wild-type VvRraA1. These findings provide insight into how VvRraA proteins can regulate VvRNase E action on its substrate RNA in V. vulnificus. In addition, based on structural and functional comparison of RraA homologs, we suggest that hexameric assembly of RraA homologs may well be required for their action on RNase E-like proteins."

This paper analyzed factors that influence supermarket food selection and proposes a supplier evaluation index system based on the whole process of food production. The author established the intuitive interval value fuzzy set evaluation model based on characteristics of the network relationship among decision makers, and validated for a multiple attribute decision making case study. Thus, the proposed model provides a reliable, accurate method for multiple attribute decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2778815146,"Wound healing is a complex biological process, and current research finds that jellyfish have a great capacity for promoting growth and healing. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms and effects of a tentacle extract (TE) from the jellyfish Cyanea capillata (C. capillata) on cell proliferation and migration in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). First, our results showed that TE at the concentration of 1 μg/ml could promote cell proliferation over various durations, induce a transition of the cells from the G1-phase to the S/G2-phase of the cell cycle, and increase the expression of cell cycle proteins (CyclinB1 and CyclinD1). Second, we found that TE could activate the PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK signaling pathways but not the NF-κB signaling pathway or the apoptosis signaling cascade. Finally, we demonstrated that the TE-induced expression of cell cycle proteins was decreased by ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 but not by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or JNK inhibitor SP600125. Similarly, the TE-enhanced migration ability of HUVECs was also markedly attenuated by PD98059. Taken together, our findings indicate that TE-induced proliferation and migration in HUVECs mainly occurred through the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway. These results are instructively important for further research on the isolation and purification of growth-promoting factors from C. capillata and are hopeful as a means to improve human wound repair in unfavorable conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2778609663,"Introduction Long chain n-3 fatty acid supplementation may modulate septic shock-induced host response to pathogen-induced sepsis. The composition of lipid emulsions for parenteral nutrition however remains a real challenge in intensive care, depending on their fatty acid content. Because they have not been assessed yet, we aimed at determining the respective effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during septic shock-induced vascular dysfunction. Methods In a peritonitis-induced septic shock model, rats were infused with EPA, DHA, an EPA/DHA mixture or 5% dextrose (D5) during 22 hours. From H18, rats were resuscitated and monitored during 4 hours. At H22, plasma, aorta and mesenteric resistance arteries were collected to perform ex vivo experiments. Results We have shown that septic rats needed an active resuscitation with fluid challenge and norepinephrine treatment, while SHAM rats did not. In septic rats, norepinephrine requirements were significantly decreased in DHA and EPA/DHA groups (10.6±12.0 and 3.7±8.0 μg/kg/min respectively versus 17.4±19.3 μg/kg/min in D5 group, p<0.05) and DHA infusion significantly improved contractile response to phenylephrine through nitric oxide pathway inhibition. DHA moreover significantly reduced vascular oxidative stress and nitric oxide production, phosphorylated IκB expression and vasodilative prostaglandin production. DHA also significantly decreased polyunsaturated fatty acid pro-inflammatory mediators and significantly increased several anti-inflammatory metabolites. Conclusions DHA infusion in septic rats improved hemodynamic dysfunction through decreased vascular oxidative stress and inflammation, while EPA infusion did not have beneficial effects."
https://openalex.org/W2779975781,"Single-unit studies in monkeys have demonstrated that neurons in the prefrontal cortex predict the reward type, reward amount or reward availability associated with a stimulus. To examine contributions of pyramidal cells and interneurons in reward processing, single-unit activity was extracellularly recorded in prefrontal cortices of four monkeys performing a reward prediction task. Based on their shapes of spike waveforms, prefrontal neurons were classified into broad-spike and narrow-spike units that represented putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively. We mainly observed that narrow-spike neurons showed higher firing rates but less bursty discharges than did broad-spike neurons. Both narrow-spike and broad-spike cells selectively responded to the stimulus, reward and their interaction, and the proportions of each type of selective neurons were similar between the two cell classes. Moreover, the two types of cells displayed equal reliability of reward or stimulus discrimination. Furthermore, we found that broad-spike and narrow-spike cells showed distinct mechanisms for encoding reward or stimulus information. Broad-spike neurons raised their firing rate relative to the baseline rate to represent the preferred reward or stimulus information, whereas narrow-spike neurons inhibited their firing rate lower than the baseline rate to encode the non-preferred reward or stimulus information. Our results suggest that narrow-spike and broad-spike cells were equally involved in reward and stimulus processing in the prefrontal cortex. They utilized a binary strategy to complementarily represent reward or stimulus information, which was consistent with the task structure in which the monkeys were required to remember two reward conditions and two visual stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2780750308,"The role of some nutrient-derived metabolites on the innate and adaptive immune responses is now established. Global research approach investigating the interplay between environment, lifestyle and the host’s immune responses is crucial in the understanding of malaria susceptibility. Advanced Glycation end products (AGE), which are food-derived metabolites result from the link between reducing sugar and amino group of proteins, lipids or nucleic acids. The level of exposure to AGEs varies depending on the type of diet. The dysfunction of the immune system induced by AGE and the cellular receptors for AGEs (RAGE) in susceptibility to bacterial infection has been described. But no study has yet explored their role in susceptibility to malaria. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate systemic AGE and RAGE gene polymorphism in two sympatric populations with previously described difference of susceptibility to malaria. We measured by ELISA the plasma levels of AGEs, and their soluble receptors (sRAGE) from 170 volunteers (68 Fulani and 102 Dogon). We also determined by real-time quantitative PCR the expression of RAGE, and the -374 T/A, -429 T/C polymorphisms and 63 bp deletion by fragment length restriction polymorphism. The prevalence rate of Plasmodium in Fulani and Dogon were respectively 42.64% and 51.30% for P. falciparum, 5.88% and 6.5% for P. malariae, 0% and 2.6% for P. ovale. The average AGE was 12.65 μg/ml, and 496.48pg/ml for sRAGE. Highest levels of sRAGE were observed in Fulani (563,07pg/ml, 95% CI [547.81–580.13] vs 465.68pg/ml, 95% CI [331.19–467.51]) for Dogon, p = 0.00001. Fulani had the lowest mean of AGE (10.21μg/ml, 95% CI [8.02–10.92]) compared to Dogon (16.88μg/ml, 95% CI [13.92–17.96]; p = 0.00001. RAGE was more expressed in Dogon than Fulani (0.08 vs 0.04), P = 0.08. The -374A polymorphism vas more frequent in Fulani (32%) compared to Dogon (20%). The chronic exposure to dietary AGE could lead to immune responses impairment and polymorphism with implications in malaria susceptibility. More studies are necessary to better investigate this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2781437930,"Copy number variations (CNV) include net gains or losses of part or whole chromosomal regions. They differ from copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (cn-LOH) events which do not induce any net change in the copy number and are often associated with uniparental disomy. These phenomena have long been reported to be associated with diseases and particularly in cancer. Losses/gains of genomic regions are often correlated with lower/higher gene expression. On the other hand, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and cn-LOH are common events in cancer and may be associated with the loss of a functional tumor suppressor gene. Therefore, identifying recurrent CNV and cn-LOH events can be important as they may highlight common biological components and give insights into the development or mechanisms of a disease. However, no currently available tools allow a comprehensive whole-genome visualization of recurrent CNVs and cn-LOH in groups of samples providing absolute quantification of the aberrations leading to the loss of potentially important information.To overcome these limitations, we developed aCNViewer (Absolute CNV Viewer), a visualization tool for absolute CNVs and cn-LOH across a group of samples. aCNViewer proposes three graphical representations: dendrograms, bi-dimensional heatmaps showing chromosomal regions sharing similar abnormality patterns, and quantitative stacked histograms facilitating the identification of recurrent absolute CNVs and cn-LOH. We illustrated aCNViewer using publically available hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) Affymetrix SNP Array data (Fig 1A). Regions 1q and 8q present a similar percentage of total gains but significantly different copy number gain categories (p-value of 0.0103 with a Fisher exact test), validated by another cohort of HCCs (p-value of 5.6e-7) (Fig 2B).aCNViewer is implemented in python and R and is available with a GNU GPLv3 license on GitHub https://github.com/FJD-CEPH/aCNViewer and Docker https://hub.docker.com/r/fjdceph/acnviewer/.aCNViewer@cephb.fr."
https://openalex.org/W2781407018,"Trypanosoma cruzi, a human protozoan parasite, is the causative agent of Chagas disease. Currently the species is divided into six taxonomic groups. The genome of the CL Brener clone has been estimated to be 106.4-110.7 Mb, and DNA content analyses revealed that it is a diploid hybrid clone. Trypanosoma rangeli is a hemoflagellate that has the same reservoirs and vectors as T. cruzi; however, it is non-pathogenic to vertebrate hosts. The haploid genome of T. rangeli was previously estimated to be 24 Mb. The parasitic strains of T. rangeli are divided into KP1(+) and KP1(-). Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the DNA content in different strains of T. cruzi and T. rangeli by flow cytometry. All T. cruzi and T. rangeli strains yielded cell cycle profiles with clearly identifiable G1-0 (2n) and G2-M (4n) peaks. T. cruzi and T. rangeli genome sizes were estimated using the clone CL Brener and the Leishmania major CC1 as reference cell lines because their genome sequences have been previously determined. The DNA content of T. cruzi strains ranged from 87,41 to 108,16 Mb, and the DNA content of T. rangeli strains ranged from 63,25 Mb to 68,66 Mb. No differences in DNA content were observed between KP1(+) and KP1(-) T. rangeli strains. Cultures containing mixtures of the epimastigote forms of T. cruzi and T. rangeli strains resulted in cell cycle profiles with distinct G1 peaks for strains of each species. These results demonstrate that DNA content analysis by flow cytometry is a reliable technique for discrimination between T. cruzi and T. rangeli isolated from different hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2775938565,"For patients with suspicious lung lesions found on chest x-ray or CT, endo/trans- bronchial biopsy of the lung is the preferred method for obtaining a diagnosis. With the addition of new screening programs, a higher number of patients will require diagnostic biopsy which will prove even more challenging due to the small size of lesions found with screening. There are many endobronchial tools available on the market today and a wide range of new tools under investigation to improve diagnostic yield. However, there is little information available about the optimal tool size required to reach the majority of lesions, especially peripheral ones. In this manuscript we investigate the percentage of lesions that can be reached for various diameter tools if the tools remain inside the airways (i.e. endobronchial biopsy) and the distance a tool must travel ""off-road"" (or outside of the airways) to reach all lesions.To further understand the distribution of lung lesions with respect to airway sizes and distances from the airways, six 3D models of the lung were generated. The airways were modeled at two different respiratory phases (inspiration and expiration). Three sets of 1,000 lesions were randomly distributed throughout the lung for each respiratory phase. The simulations showed that the percentage of reachable lesions decreases with increasing tool diameter and decreasing lesion diameter. A 1mm diameter tool will reach <25% of 1cm lesions if it remains inside the airways. To reach all 1cm lesions this 1mm tool would have to navigate through the parenchyma up to 8.5mm. CT scans of 21 patient lesions confirm these results reasonably well.The smaller the tool diameter the more likely it will be able to reach a lung lesion, whether it be for diagnostic biopsy, ablation, or resection. However, even a 1mm tool is not small enough to reach the majority of small (1-2cm) lesions. Therefore, it is necessary for endobronchial tools to be able to navigate through the parenchyma to reach the majority of lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2779213634,"Recently, because the quality of laboratory analyses has increased along with the need for quality improvement, several external quality control bodies have adapted performance specifications using the Desirable Biological Variation Database, termed ""Ricos goals""; these criteria are more stringent than those presented in CLIA 88. In this study, we aimed to validate newly introduced serum separator tubes, Improvacutor, for routine clinical chemistry testing in accordance with Ricos goals and CLIA 88. Blood samples were collected from 100 volunteers into three types of serum vacuum tubes: Greiner Vacuette, Becton Dickinson (BD) Vacutainer, and Improve Improvacutor. The samples were subjected to 16 routine chemistry tests using a TBA-200fr NEO chemistry autoanalyzer. In the comparison analysis, all 16 test results were acceptable according to CLIA 88. However, in the comparison of Improve and BD tubes, creatinine showed 4.31% (+0.08 μmol/L) bias. This slightly exceeded the Desirable Specification for Inaccuracy Ricos limit of ±3.96%, but still satisfied the CLIS88 limit of ±26.52 μmol/L. The remaining 15 analytes performed acceptably according to the Desirable Specifications of Ricos. The correlation coefficient of 12 analytes was greater than 0.95 in Passing-Bablok regression analysis among the three tubes, but was lower for four analytes: calcium, sodium, potassium, and chloride. In the stability assay, only potassium tested in the Greiner tube revealed a larger positive bias (2.18%) than the Ricos Desirable Specification for Inaccuracy based on biologic variation (1.8%). The BD tube also showed a positive bias of 1.74%, whereas the new Improve tube showed the smallest positive bias of 1.17% in potassium level after 72 h storage. Thus, the results of this study demonstrate that recently introduced analytical performance specifications based on components of biological variation (Rico's goal) could be extended to criterion for performance evaluation and applied."
