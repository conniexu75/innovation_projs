https://openalex.org/W2069851285,"Antibodies from the serum of patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or with the AIDS-related complex and from the serum of seropositive healthy homosexuals, recognize two major glycoproteins in cells infected with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV III). These glycoproteins, gp160 and gp120, are encoded by the 2.5-kilobase open reading frame located in the 3' end of the HTLV-III genome, as determined by amino terminus sequence analysis of the radiolabeled forms of these proteins. It is hypothesized that gp160 and gp120 represent the major species of virus-encoded envelope gene products for HTLV-III."
https://openalex.org/W2025356775,"Previously, we reported that ZP3, one of three different glycoproteins present in the mouse egg's zona pellucida, serves as a sperm receptor. Furthermore, small glycopeptides derived from egg ZP3 retain full sperm receptor activity, suggesting a role for carbohydrate, rather than polypeptide chain in receptor function. Here, we report that removal of O-linked oligosaccharides from ZP3 destroys its sperm receptor activity, whereas removal of N-linked oligosaccharides has no effect. A specific size class of O-linked oligosaccharides, recovered following mild alkaline hydrolysis and reduction of ZP3, is shown to possess sperm receptor activity and to bind to sperm. The results presented strongly suggest that mouse sperm bind to eggs via O-linked oligosaccharides present on ZP3."

https://openalex.org/W2068953892,"First trimester human placentas actively express the sis proto-oncogene, the structural gene for the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Using the in situ hybridization technique, the 4.2 kb c-sis transcript has been localized to the cytotrophoblastic component, especially the highly proliferative and invasive cytotrophoblastic shell, paralleling the distribution of c-myc transcripts in early placenta. Explants of first trimester placenta release significant levels of PDGF-like activity into the medium under apparent developmental control. Moreover, cultured trophoblasts display abundant high-affinity PDGF receptors and respond to exogenous authentic PDGF by an activation of the c-myc gene and DNA synthesis. The developing human placenta may therefore represent a case of autocrine growth regulation in a normal tissue, in which cells bearing receptors for a growth factor can also synthesize and respond to that factor."
https://openalex.org/W2094038629,"Mechanisms of alternative RNA splicing, important in the generation of protein diversity, are common but incompletely understood. Among the contractile proteins, troponin T exists in several isoforms, shown to be derived in part from a novel pattern of differential RNA splicing in the 3′ region of the rat skeletal fast troponin T gene. In fact, this gene has a previously unsuspected capacity to encode multiple isoforms. The isolation of four distinct but related cDNAs from this gene, which share discontinuous subsegments of sequence identity in their 5′ regions, and the determination of the genomic sequence, demonstrate that small exons with characteristic split codon structure are differentially spliced in intricate combinatorial patterns to generate a minimum of 10, and potentially 64, distinct troponin T mRNAs, encoding different isoforms, in a developmentally regulated and tissue-specific manner. At least two of these mRNAs are spliced from structurally identical primary transcripts, necessitating control by trans-acting factors."

https://openalex.org/W1994970763,"We have studied the properties of a factor or factors that bind selectively to the 5′ flanking region of the chicken adult β-globin (βA-globin) gene. We previously showed that these components, when bound with histones on plasmids containing the region, confer on the complex a pattern of hypersensitivity to nuclease digestion similar to that in the nucleus. We have now measured the abundance of the factor(s) in partially purified preparations, and the affinity constants for binding to specific and nonspecific DNA sequences. Footprinting studies of the specific complex with DNAase I and II reveal two discrete protected regions within the hypersensitive domain. When these regions are physically separated, they interact with the factor(s) independently, suggesting that each region binds one or more distinct components. The footprint patterns of our complexes in vitro agree with the patterns observed in intact chicken erythrocyte nuclei. These complexes thus are on the transcriptionally active βA-globin gene in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1977489960,"In this study, two glycoproteins (gp160 and gp120) that are encoded by human T-cell lymphoma virus type III (HTLV-III) were the antigens most consistently recognized by antibodies found in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and with the AIDS-related complex (ARC) and in healthy homosexual males. The techniques used to detect the glycoproteins were radioimmunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (RIP/SDS-PAGE). Although most antibody-positive samples from ARC patients and from healthy homosexual males also reacted with the virus core protein p24, less than half of the AIDS patients revealed a positive band with p24 under the same conditions. The ability to detect antibodies against a profile of both the major env gene encoded antigens and the gag gene encoded antigens suggests that the RIP/SDS-PAGE may be a valuable confirmatory assay for establishing the presence or absence of antibodies to HTLV-III in human serum samples."

https://openalex.org/W2019310520,"In humans, herpes simplex virus causes a primary infection and then often a latent ganglionic infection that persists for life. Because these latent infections can recur periodically, vaccines are needed that can protect against both primary and latent herpes simplex infections. Infectious vaccinia virus recombinants that contain the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein D gene under control of defined early or late vaccinia virus promoters were constructed. Tissue culture cells infected with these recombinant viruses synthesized a glycosylated protein that had the same mass (60,000 daltons) as the glycoprotein D produced by HSV-1. Immunization of mice with one of these recombinant viruses by intradermal, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal routes resulted in the production of antibodies that neutralized HSV-1 and protected the mice against subsequent lethal challenge with HSV-1 or HSV-2. Immunization with the recombinant virus also protected the majority of the mice against the development of a latent HSV-1 infection of the trigeminal ganglia. This is the first demonstration that a genetically engineered vaccine can prevent the development of latency."
https://openalex.org/W1481615076,"Thirty-three kilobase pairs (kb) of human DNA containing the haptoglobin (Hp) and haptoglobin-related (Hpr) gene pair were cloned, and the nucleotide sequence of 21-kb DNA was determined. The two genes are closely linked, with Hpr being 2.2 kb downstream of Hp. Six hundred nucleotides of DNA occur between the two genes that are not found either 5' to the Hp gene or 3' to the Hpr gene. After the duplication event, the first intron of the Hpr gene acquired a 9-kb insert consisting mainly of a retrovirus-like element with a potential primer-binding site homologous to a mouse isoleucine tRNA. The element forms a repeated family in the human genome that I name RTVL-I (retrovirus-like element-isoleucine). In the coding region of the Hpr gene, there are no frameshift or nonsense mutations and its exon-intron splicing sites, 5' flanking and 3' flanking sequences do not show any obvious defects. There are 28 amino acid differences between the decoded amino acid sequences of the Hpr and Hp genes. Sixteen of these differences occur in the hpr beta chain, and all appear to be located on the surface of the molecule in places not thought to be involved in the hemoglobin binding function of haptoglobin. The structure of the Hpr gene suggests that the gene may be expressed and give rise to a functional product."
https://openalex.org/W1508250182,"Using polysomal immunoselected rat liver glutathione S-transferase mRNAs, we have constructed cDNA clones using DNA polymerase I, RNase H, and Escherichia coli ligase (NAD+)-mediated second strand cDNA synthesis as described by Gubler and Hoffman (Gubler, U., and Hoffman, B. S. (1983) Gene 25, 263-269). Recombinant clone, pGTB42, contained a cDNA insert of 900 base pairs whose 3' end showed specificity for the Yc mRNA in hybrid-select translation experiments. The nucleotide sequence of pGTB42 has been determined, and the complete amino acid sequence of a Yc subunit has been deduced. The cDNA clone contains an open reading frame of 663 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide comprising 221 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25,322. The NH2-terminal sequence deduced from pGTB42 is in agreement with the first 39 amino acids determined for a Ya-Yc heterodimer by conventional protein-sequencing techniques. A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of pGTB42 with the sequence of a Ya clone, pGTB38, described previously by our laboratory (Pickett, C. B., Telakowski-Hopkins, C. A., Ding, G. J.-F., Argenbright, L., and Lu, A.Y.H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5182-5188) reveals a sequence homology of 66% over the same regions of both clones; however, the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of the Ya and Yc mRNAs are totally divergent in their sequences. The overall amino acid sequence homology between the Ya and Yc subunits is 68%, however, the NH2-terminal domain is more highly conserved than the middle or carboxyl-terminal domains. Our data suggest that the Ya and Yc subunits of the rat liver glutathione S-transferases are products of two different mRNAs which are derived from two related yet different genes."
https://openalex.org/W2056168855,"The antitumor drug, m-AMSA (4′-(9-acridinylamino)-methanesulfon-m-anisidide), is known to interfere with the breakage-reunion reaction of mammalian DNA topoisomerase II by blocking the enzyme-DNA complex in its putative cleavable state. Treatment of SV40 virus infected monkey cells with m-AMSA resulted in both single- and double-stranded breaks on SV40 viral chromatin. These strand breaks are unusual because they are covalently associated with protein. Immuno-precipitation results suggest that the covalently linked protein is DNA topoisomerase II. These results are consistent with the proposal that the drug action in vivo involves the stabilization of a cleavable complex between topoisomerase II and DNA in chromatin. Mapping of these double-stranded breaks on SV40 viral DNA revealed multiple topoisomerase II cleavage sites. A major topoisomerase II cleavage site was preferentially induced during late infection and was mapped in the DNAase I hypersensitive region of SV40 chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1572235763,"The anticancer drug adriamycin binds iron and these complexes cycle to reduce molecular oxygen (Zweier, J. L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6056-6058). Optical absorption, EPR, and Mossbauer spectroscopic data are correlated with polarographic O2 consumption and chemical Fe2+ extraction measurements in order to characterize each step in this cycle. Fe3+ binds to adriamycin at physiologic pH forming a complex with an optical absorbance maximum at 600 nm. EPR signals at g = 4.2 and g = 2.01, and a doublet Mossbauer spectrum with isomer shift delta = 0.57 mm/s and quadrupole splitting delta EQ = 0.74 mm/s are observed indicating that the Fe3+ bound to adriamycin is high spin S = 5/2. Under anaerobic conditions the absorbance maximum at 600 nm decreases with an exponential decay constant = 0.77 h-1, and the EPR and Mossbauer spectra of Fe3+-adriamycin similarly decrease as the Fe3+ is reduced to EPR silent Fe2+. The Fe2+-adriamycin complex which is formed exhibits a Mossbauer spectrum with delta = 1.18 mm/s and delta EQ = 1.82 mm/s indicative of high spin Fe2+. As the EPR spectra of Fe3+-adriamycin decrease on reduction of the Fe3+ to Fe2+ a signal of the oxidized adriamycin free radical appears at g = 2.004 with line width of 8 G. On exposure to O2 the absorption maximum at 600 nm, the Fe3+ EPR, and the Fe3+ Mossbauer spectra all return. Polarographic measurements demonstrate that O2 is consumed and that H2O2 is formed. Addition of high affinity Fe2+ chelators block O2 consumption indicating that Fe2+ formation is essential for O2 reduction. This cycle of iron-mediated O2 reduction can explain the formation of the reactive reduced oxygen and adriamycin radicals which are thought to mediate the biological activity of adriamycin."

https://openalex.org/W2108858320,A cDNA containing the coding region for the complete amino acid sequence of wound-induced proteinase Inhibitor I from tomato leaves was constructed in the plasmid pUC9 and characterized. The open reading frame codes for a protein of 111 amino acids. This deduced amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a 42-amino acid N-terminal sequence that is not found in the native protein. This sequence appears to contain a 23-amino acid segment typical of a signal sequence followed by a 19-amino acid sequence containing 9 charged amino acids. The 42-amino acid sequence is apparently lost during maturation to the native Inhibitor I and represents 38% of the translated protein. The Inhibitor I amino acid sequence contains 71% identity with potato tuber Inhibitor I sequence and 35% identity with an inhibitor from the leech.
https://openalex.org/W2008268465,"We describe experiments with two monoclonal antibodies to the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) nucleocapsid protein N with strikingly different characteristics. Antibody 1 binds to nucleocapsids and probably the pool of free (unbound) N protein; it inhibits transcription in vitro, and when microinjected into cells, protects the cells against VSV. Antibody 2 binds poorly to nucleocapsids, does not inhibit transcription, but when microinjected into cells, binds selectively to the free N and delays the appearance of progeny virus. We have confirmed these results by analyzing the effect of these antibodies on in vitro genomic RNA synthesis. The results of both the in vivo and in vitro experiments show that the replication of the VSV genome is controlled by the availability of the nucleocapsid protein, even when the polymerase has access to the host factors and multiple phosphorylated forms of the NS protein thought to be involved in genomic RNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2066157608,"We have constructed an actin-HIS4 gene fusion, such that expression of HIS4 requires proper splicing of the actin intron. Using this chimeric gene in an in vivo screen for splicing mutations, we have isolated a G to A transition in the fifth position of the yeast 5' consensus sequence/GTAPyGT. This mutation still allows the junction to be recognized by the splicing machinery, albeit inefficiently. Surprisingly, the fidelity of the 5' endonucleolytic cleavage is also reduced. This results in an incorrect cleavage 6 nucleotides 5' of the 5' junction, at the dinucleotide/AT. Cleavage at this abnormal site does not lead to the production of mature mRNA, although this species appears to be in a lariat structure. The behavior of this mutant argues that recognition of the 5' junction and subsequent cleavage are separable events and, furthermore, that requirements for 3' endonucleolytic cleavage may be more complex than previously imagined."
https://openalex.org/W2029892426,"The chromatin structure characteristic of constitutively expressed genes, tissue-specific genes, and inactive genes is absent in chicken sperm chromatin. However, point sites of undermethylation in sperm DNA within constitutively expressed genes, but not within globin genes or an inactive gene, correspond to the location of regions of altered chromatin structure (hypersensitive sites) in somatic tissue and spermatogonial cells. A de novo methylation process whereby regions within and flanking these genes become methylated, but which excludes the methylation of sequences within hypersensitive sites, occurs between the spermatogonial stage and the first meiotic prophase. These undermethylated regions may play a role in the activation of the paternal genome during embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1629566464,"Adenosine acting through membrane-bound A1 receptors is capable of inhibiting the enzyme adenylate cyclase. A1 adenosine receptors from rat cerebral cortex have been solubilized in high yield and in an active form with the detergent digitonin. The solubilized receptors bind the agonist radioligand (-)-N6-3-[125I] iodo-4-hydroxyphenylisopropyl)adenosine (HPIA) with the same high affinity, demonstrate the same agonist and antagonist potency series and stereo-specificity as the membrane-bound A1 receptor. In addition to maintaining high affinity agonist binding, soluble A1 receptors' affinity for agonists is still modulated by guanine nucleotides. This result contrasts with other adenylate cyclase coupled receptors (beta 2, alpha 2, D2) wherein high affinity agonist binding is lost subsequent to solubilization. To investigate the molecular basis for this difference, solubilized A1 receptors which were labeled with [125I]HPIA either prior to or subsequent to solubilization, were compared by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Both labeled species demonstrated exactly the same sedimentation properties and display guanine nucleotide sensitivity. This suggests that the same guanine nucleotide-sensitive receptor complex formed in membranes in stable to solubilization and can form a high affinity agonist complex in soluble preparation. The molecular mechanism responsible for the stable receptor complex in this system compared to the beta 2, alpha 2, and D2 systems remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1525213463,"Using purified rat ventricular myocytes and membranes prepared from them, we have previously found that alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation causes decreased cyclic AMP accumulation and decreased activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. We have now analyzed the mechanism by which alpha 1 stimulation is linked to cyclic AMP metabolism. In an adenylate cyclase assay in which carbachol inhibits the stimulatory effect of norepinephrine, the addition of prazosin (alpha 1-antagonist) has no effect on the response to norepinephrine. In membranes prepared from myocytes treated with pertussis toxin, norepinephrine competes for alpha 1-receptors (assessed by [3H]prazosin binding) with two components, binding to the high affinity component being sensitive to exogenous GTP, exactly as in membranes prepared from control myocytes. In intact cells labeled with [3H]adenine in which carbachol antagonizes the norepinephrine response, prazosin enhances accumulation of [3H]cyclic AMP due to norepinephrine. Treatment of cells with pertussis toxin eliminates inhibition by carbachol but does not alter prazosin's capacity to enhance the norepinephrine response. Addition of phosphodiesterase inhibitors eliminates this effect of alpha 1 blockade. In [3H]adenine-labeled cells loaded with [3H]cyclic AMP by prior treatment with isoproterenol, alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation enhances disappearance of [3H]cyclic AMP. Measurements of cellular cyclic AMP give results similar to those obtained with the adenine labeling technic. We conclude that occupation of the myocyte alpha 1-receptor results in stimulation of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2042690900,Cotton-top tamarins were inoculated with sufficient Epstein-Barr virus to induce multiple tumors in each animal within 14 to 21 days. The tumors consisted of large-cell lymphomas that contained multiple copies of the Epstein-Barr virus genome and generated Epstein-Barr virus-carrying cell lines showing no detectable consistent chromosomal abnormality. Hybridization of tumor DNA with immunoglobulin gene probes revealed that each lymphoma was oligo- or monoclonal in origin and that individual tumors from the same animal arose from different B-cell clones. Thus the virus induced multiple transformation events in tamarins in vivo to cause malignant tumors resembling the Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphomas of patients with organ transplants.
https://openalex.org/W1578729488,"Active beef heart aconitase contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster. One iron of the cluster, Fea, is labile and can be removed easily by oxidation in air to yield the [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster of inactive aconitase. We have previously shown that substrate binds to Fea. We have continued our Mossbauer studies by further investigating the active and inactive forms of the enzyme. When active aconitase, [4Fe-4S]2+, is mixed with substrate, two species (substrates or intermediates bound to Fea) labeled S1 and S2 are obtained. With the nitroanalogs of citrate and isocitrate, thought to be transition state analogs, and fluorocitrate, species S2, but not S1, is observed, suggesting that S2 represents a carbanion transition state complex. We have prepared Mossbauer samples by rapid mix/rapid freeze techniques. Using either citrate, isocitrate or cis-aconitate, the natural substrates, we have been able to detect at 0 degree C reaction intermediates in the 5-35 ms time range and, studying enzyme substrate interactions at subzero temperatures in a water/methanol/ethylene glycol solvent, we have observed new species when substrates were added at -60 degrees C. Details of these experiments are given, although in neither case can unique interpretations be offered at this time. We have also investigated reduced active aconitase ([4Fe-4S]1+; EPR at g = 1.94) in the presence of substrate with material selectively enriched with 57Fe in either Fea or the other three cluster sites. The spectra were analyzed with a spin Hamiltonian, and the results are discussed and interpreted in terms of three inequivalent Fe sites in the cluster. Finally, we have studied enzyme containing the reduced [3Fe-4S]0 cluster. There is no indication that citrate binds to the 3Fe cluster, and since no significant activity was observed, we conclude that aconitase containing a 3Fe cluster is not active in either oxidation state."

https://openalex.org/W1968835591,"We have characterized an aberrant allele of a variably spliced Drosophila tropomyosin gene. The allele was recovered from the flightless Ifm(3)3 strain, which has been shown to have structurally and functionally abnormal indirect flight muscles. The transcribed portion of the mutant gene is interrupted by an 8,8 kb insertion of middle repetitive DNA having a structure typical of copia-like Drosophila mobile elements. The insertion is positioned so as to interrupt an exon sequence in one splicing mode and, simultaneously, an intron in the alternate mode. As a consequence of the insertion the allele fails to direct synthesis of the flight muscle-specific tropomyosin isoform, but remains capable of specifying a second isoform, which accumulates in nonfibrillar Drosophila muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1574076082,"Experiments were performed to probe the role of exocytotic and endocytotic processes in the regulation of the human granulocyte O-2-generating system. Analytical subcellular fractionation studies indicated that 25-30% of the total cellular b-cytochrome and 8-10% of the flavin co-sedimented with plasma membrane markers, irrespective of stimulation of the cells by the chemoattractants N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (FMLP) or C5a. Phorbol myristate acetate stimulation resulted in significant translocation of b-cytochrome but not flavin from the specific granule/Golgi to the plasma membrane-enriched fractions. These results indicated that approximately 3.1 X 10(5) flavin and 0.8-1 X 10(6) b-cytochrome molecules are present in the plasma membrane of an isolated unstimulated human granulocyte and that these levels are invariant upon stimulation with chemoattractants. Maximal instantaneous rates of O-2 generation by cells in these preparations, however, were equivalent for all the stimuli. Since stimulation of granulocytes by phorbol myristate acetate, FMLP, or C5a results in exocytosis and/or endocytosis, then the role of these processes in regulating stimulated O-2 production by controlling the content of plasma membrane redox enzymes is questionable. This conclusion was supported by observations made with cytoplasts, which do not have an intracellular reserve of granules. Cytoplasts prepared from granulocytes produced O-2 at equivalent rates as their parent cells on a per unit surface area basis. These results suggest: 1) that stimulation of granulocytes with chemotactic peptides leads to full generation of O-2 at the cell surface without exocytotic recruitment of additional b-cytochrome and flavoprotein from the cytoplasmic compartment; 2) that these redox enzymes are not internalized along with chemoattractant receptors; and 3) that traffic of these redox enzymes between endo- and plasma membranes is not involved in the regulation of O-2 production in suspensions of human granulocytes stimulated by chemoattractants."

https://openalex.org/W1536598476,"Iron delivery to K562 cells is enhanced by desferrioxamine through induction of transferrin receptors. Experiments were performed to further characterize this event with respect to iron metabolism and heme synthesis. In control cells, up to 85% of the iron taken up from iron-transferrin was incorporated into ferritin, 7% into heme, and the remainder into compartments not yet identified. In cells grown with desferrioxamine, net accumulation of intracellular desferrioxamine (14-fold) was observed and iron incorporation into ferritin and heme was inhibited by 86% and 75%, respectively. In contrast, complete inhibition of heme synthesis in cells grown with succinylacetone had no effect on transferrin binding or iron uptake. Exogenous hemin (30 microM) inhibited transferrin binding and iron uptake by 70% and heme synthesis by 90%. These effects were already evident after 2 h. Thus, although heme production could be reduced by desferrioxamine, succinylacetone, and hemin, cell iron uptake was enhanced only by the intracellular iron chelator. The effects of exogenous heme are probably unphysiologic and the greater inhibition of iron flow into heme can be explained by effects on early steps of heme synthesis. We conclude that in this cell model a chelatable intracellular iron pool rather than heme synthesis mediates regulation of iron uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2067990546,"Cerebrospinal fluid taken from rats subjected to electroshock-induced seizures and injected into the cerebral ventricles of rats that had not been shocked increased the seizure threshold of the recipients. The anticonvulsant activity of the donor cerebrospinal fluid was antagonized by opioid antagonists and enhanced by peptidase inhibitors. These results suggest the existence of an endogenous anticonvulsant substance in rat cerebrospinal fluid, possibly opioid in nature, which is activated as a consequence of a seizure and which may play a critical role in postseizure inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2090318845,"Dominant mutations in the yeast nuclear gene NAM2 cure the RNA splicing deficiency resulting from the inactivation of the bI4 maturase encoded by the fourth intron of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. This maturase is required to splice the fourth intron of this gene and to splice the fourth intron of the mitochondrial gene oxi3 encoding cytochrome oxidase subunit I. We have cloned the nuclear gene NAM2, which codes for two overlapping RNAs, 3.2 kb and 3.0 kb long, which are transcribed in the same direction but differ at their 5' ends. NAM2 compensating mutations probably result from point mutations in the structural gene. Integration of the cloned gene occurs at its homologous locus on the right arm of chromosome XII. Inactivation of the NAM2 gene either by transplacement with a deleted copy of the gene, or by disruption, is not lethal to the cell, but leads to the destruction of the mitochondrial genome with the production of 100% cytoplasmic petites."
https://openalex.org/W1492697580,"When a partially purified insulin receptor preparation immobilized on insulin-agarose is incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, Mn2+, and Mg2+ ions, the receptor beta subunit becomes 32P-labeled. The 32P-labeling of the insulin receptor beta subunit is increased by 2-3-fold when src kinase is included in the phosphorylation reaction. In addition, the presence of src kinase results in the phosphorylation of a Mr = 125,000 species. The Mr = 93,000 receptor beta subunit and the Mr = 125,000 32P-labeled bands are absent when an insulin receptor-deficient sample, prepared by the inclusion of excess free insulin to inhibit the adsorption of the receptor to the insulin-agarose, is phosphorylated in the presence of the src kinase. These results indicate that the insulin receptor alpha and beta subunits are phosphorylated by the src kinase. The src kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the insulin receptor is not due to the activation of receptor autophosphorylation because a N-ethylmaleimide-treated receptor preparation devoid of receptor kinase activity is also phosphorylated by the src kinase. Conversely, the insulin receptor kinase does not catalyze phosphorylation of the active or N-ethylmaleimide-inactivated src kinase. Subsequent to src kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, the insulin receptor, either immobilized on insulin-agarose or in detergent extracts, exhibits a 2-fold increase in associated kinase activity using histone as substrate. src kinase mediates phosphorylation of predominantly tyrosine residues on both alpha and beta subunits of the insulin receptor. Tryptic peptide mapping of the 32P-labeled receptor alpha and beta subunits by high pressure liquid chromatography reveals that the src kinase-mediated phosphorylation sites on both receptor subunits exhibit elution profiles identical with those phosphorylated by the receptor kinase. Furthermore, the HPLC elution profile of the receptor auto- or src kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation sites on the receptor alpha subunit are also identical with that on the receptor beta subunit. These results indicate that: the src kinase catalyzes tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor alpha and beta subunits; and src kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of insulin receptor can mimic the action of autophosphorylation to activate the insulin receptor kinase in vitro, although whether this occurs in intact cells remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1484750832,"Recombinant DNA clones corresponding to 11 beta-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 (P-450(11)beta) have been identified in a bovine adrenocortical cDNA library. These clones, pB11 beta-1 and pB11 beta-2, hybridize to at least three RNA species, 7.2, 6.2, and 4.3 kilobases in length, present in the adrenal cortex. All three RNA species directed cytochrome P-450(11)beta synthesis in an in vitro translation system. Expression of the cytochrome P-450(11)beta gene is tissue specific in that these transcripts were not detected in liver, heart, kidney, or corpus luteum. In cultured bovine adrenocortical cells, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) or dibutyryl cAMP increased the concentration of cytochrome P-450(11)beta transcripts. This increase appears to be at least partially due to de novo transcription as shown by the action of actinomycin D which effectively blocked the ACTH-induced increase in cytochrome P-450(11)beta RNA level. Furthermore, cycloheximide administered prior to or along with ACTH resulted in the blockage of any new transcription of the cytochrome P-450(11)beta gene as evidenced from the level of RNA. Thus, in addition to potential effects on RNA stabilization, a primary action of ACTH in the regulation of the level of cytochrome P-450(11)beta may be to mediate the induction of an unidentified adrenocortical protein which is required for the activation of cytochrome P-450(11)beta gene expression. These results, together with previous studies (Kramer, R.E., Rainey, W.E., Funkenstein, B., Dee, A., Simpson, E. R., and Waterman, M. R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 707-713) that showed increased intracellular levels of cAMP upon treatment of bovine adrenocortical cell cultures with ACTH, suggest a role for cAMP-mediated events in the regulation of cytochrome P-450(11)beta gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1562372319,"Several phosphoglycerate kinase genes were previously detected in the human genome by blot hybridization with a phosphoglycerate kinase cDNA probe. Using subcloned fragments of the cDNA we estimate the presence of four independent phosphoglycerate kinase genes. These genes have been mapped to both the human X chromosome (band q13) and chromosome 6 (p12-21.1) using a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and by chromosomal in situ hybridization. The genomic distribution of phosphoglycerate kinase sequences is conserved in man and mouse, not only for the X chromosome, but also for linkage to the respective major histocompatibility complexes. Molecular cloning of X-linked phosphoglycerate kinase sequences led to the identification of a novel intronless phosphoglycerate kinase pseudogene which is localized proximal to the active gene on the X chromosome."

By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, all five MAP components were shown to possess a pI of around 5. Four of these proteins, MAP-1A, MAP-1C, MAP-2A, and MAP-2B, present in comparable amounts, were iodinated after electrophoretic separation and analyzed by two-dimensional peptide mapping. With both trypsin and V8 protease, almost identical patterns were obtained from MAP-2A and MAP-2B. MAP-1A and MAP-1C, too, gave similar digestion patterns, although some differences were noted. Incubation with [gamma-32P]ATP demonstrated that endogeneous protein kinase activities phosphorylated individual subcomponents at different rates. MAP-2A, the highest labeled component, was phosphorylated 2.5-fold compared to MAP-2B both in the presence and the absence of cAMP. Labeling of MAP-1 subcomponents was 4 times less than that of MAP-2A in the absence and 16 times less in the presence of cAMP. 32P-labeled MAP-2A and MAP-2B bands were indistinguishable by one-dimensional peptide mapping, as were the three MAP-1 bands. For both MAP-1 and MAP-2 subcomponents, cAMP induced phosphorylation at new molecular sites. Incubation of radiolabeled microtubule proteins with 1 mM ATP effected, upon electrophoresis, a clear shift of MAP-2A and MAP-2B bands to positions of higher apparent molecular weights, while only slightly affecting MAP-1 bands."
https://openalex.org/W2045901895,"Splicing of the Tetrahymena ribosomal RNA precursor is mediated by the folded structure of the RNA molecule and therefore occurs in the absence of any protein in vitro. The Tetrahymena intervening sequence (IVS) has been inserted into the gene for the alpha-donor fragment of beta-galactosidase in a recombinant plasmid. Production of functional beta-galactosidase is dependent on RNA splicing in vivo in Escherichia coli. Thus RNA self-splicing can occur at a rate sufficient to support gene expression in a prokaryote, despite the likely presence of ribosomes on the nascent RNA. The beta-galactosidase messenger RNA splicing system provides a useful method for screening for splicing-defective mutations, several of which have been characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1500447870,"The DNA intermediates and final products formed by the Type I restriction endonuclease, EcoB, were further characterized. DNA cleaved on only one strand (hemi-restricted DNA) contains gaps of approximately 70-100 nucleotides, while the fully restricted products contain 3'-single-stranded tails averaging approximately 70-100 nucleotides for each strand cleaved. The gaps and tails are formed with the release of an equal number of nucleotides as small oligonucleotides that are soluble in acid. After purification, neither the hemi-restricted nor the fully restricted DNAs are cleaved again by EcoB. There is no apparent specificity for which strand of a duplex is initially cleaved by EcoB, nor is there specificity with respect to the composition of the 3'-terminal nucleotide formed on the DNA or the 3'- or 5'-terminal nucleotides of the acid-soluble oligonucleotides released during DNA cleavage. The structure formed at the 5' terminus of the DNA product which blocks phosphorylation by T4 polynucleotide kinase remains unknown, but its removal with phage lambda exonuclease allows at least some reutilization of recognition sites by EcoB as well as phosphorylation of the newly formed 5' termini. To explain the complex mechanism of this enzyme, it is suggested that the unidentified 5'-tails prevent wasteful rerestriction from occurring, whereas the 3'-single-stranded tails create DNA which, when nonhomologous to chromosomal DNA, cannot be rescued because such tails are not substrate for DNA polymerases. However, when homologous chromosomal DNA exists, the randomly cleaved large fragments with these tails can easily be assimilated by recA-mediated genetic recombination, thus stimulating DNA exchange between related organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1598429267,"Calmodulin tryptic fragments 78-148, 107-148, and 1-77 coupled to Sepharose 4B were used to test the ability of different calmodulin-regulated enzymes to recognize different domains of calmodulin. Fragment 107-148, which contains a single Ca2+-binding domain, does not interact with any of the calmodulin binding proteins. Fragments 1-77 and 78-148, each of which contains two Ca2+-binding domains, have preserved their ability to interact with several calmodulin-dependent enzymes. Most of the calmodulin-regulated enzymes in brain extracts, such as cAMP phosphodiesterase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (calcineurin) interact with fragment 78-148 in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. An ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-sensitive, calmodulin-independent, p-nitrophenyl phosphatase does not bind to the affinity column and is resolved from calcineurin at this step. Although calmodulin-stimulated protein kinase(s) can interact with fragment 78-148, their interaction is prevented by increased ionic strength even in the presence of Ca2+. Fragment 1-77 exhibits a higher degree of selectivity than fragment 78-148. Only cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cAMP phosphodiesterase bind to fragment 1-77. These results confirm the multiple modes of interaction of calmodulin with its target proteins and provide the basis for a selective purification of calmodulin-regulated enzymes by affinity chromatography on specific calmodulin fragments coupled to Sepharose."

https://openalex.org/W1484116406,"We have cloned the Escherichia coli lipoprotein structural gene (lpp) into a shuttle vector and studied its expression in both E. coli and in Bacillus subtilis. Using in vitro gene fusion techniques, the lpp gene was placed under the control of the promoter for the erythromycin-resistance (ery) gene. This fusion gene directed the synthesis of Braun's prolipoprotein which can be subsequently processed into the mature lipoprotein. In addition to the prolipoprotein, two ery-lpp hybrid proteins containing a 45- and a 22-amino acid extension preceding the NH2 terminus of prolipoprotein, respectively, are also synthesized in E. coli. The synthesis of these three proteins appears to involve the utilization of three distinct translation initiation sites. In B. subtilis, only two proteins are synthesized, the hybrid protein with a 45-amino acid extension and the prolipoprotein. In both E. coli and B. subtilis, the precursor forms of the hybrid proteins are lipid-modified, and they are processed to mature lipoprotein in vivo. These results indicate that internalized signal sequence containing the prolipoprotein modification and processing site (Leu-Ala-Glys-Cys) can function normally and permit the modification of hybrid proteins to lipid-modified precursors which can be subsequently processed by the globomycin-sensitive prolipoprotein signal peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1627293674,"The protein components required for generation of cohesive ends in vitro from circular bacteriophage P2 DNA have been purified to near homogeneity. In the presence of ATP, the purified products of P2 genes M and P together with empty phage capsids (comprised primarily of the N protein) mediate site-specific cleavage of circular P2 DNA at the cohesive end site (cos). This terminase or ter system also utilizes circular DNAs of bacteriophages P4 and 186, introducing site-specific scissions at cos sites within these molecules. The ter reaction exhibits a peculiar requirement for a circular DNA substrate. Substrate activity is greatly reduced when circular P2, P4, or 186 DNAs are linearized by restriction endonuclease hydrolysis. Furthermore, multimeric P4 DNA molecule sites are also essentially inactive in the linear form but are active in the circular state. The dependence of ter action on a circular substrate is not due to inhibition of the system by linear DNA, nor does it appear to reflect a requirement for substrate superhelicity since circular P4 DNA containing single strand scissions is subject to terminase action. The terminase reaction is supported by ATP, dATP, or beta, gamma-imido ATP, but not by other ribonucleoside triphosphates ADP, alpha, beta-methylene ATP, or beta, gamma-methylene ATP. A DNA-dependent ATPase, which hydrolyzes ATP to AMP, copurifies with the P2 P protein and is inactivated with the same kinetics as P activity upon treatment with N-ethylmaleimide. The ATPase does not display specificity for P2 DNA in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1570741201,"Cytochrome b562-o complex, a terminal oxidase in the respiratory chain of aerobically grown Escherichia coli, has been studied by resonance Raman spectroscopy in its air-oxidized, dithionite-reduced, and reduced and CO-ligated states. In the reduced state, with a 406.7-nm excitation, there appeared 1494 and 1473 cm-1 lines, indicating that low spin and high spin components are included in the cytochrome b562-o complex. For the air-oxidized protein, resonance Raman lines were observed at 1372, 1503, and 1580 cm-1 with a 413.1-nm excitation, indicating that there is a ferric low spin heme. In addition, a weak but appreciable Raman line was observed at 1480 cm-1 assignable to a ferric high spin heme. Accordingly, it was concluded that low spin and high spin components are included in the cytochrome b562-o complex in the reduced and the air-oxidized states. In the CO-ligated state, with a defocused laser beam of 413.1 nm, two Raman bands assignable to the Fe-CO stretching mode have been observed at 489 and 523 cm-1, as a major and a minor component, respectively. When the laser beam was focused upon the sample to cause a photodissociation of CO from the heme moiety, the intensity of the major band at 489 cm-1 was reduced as expected. On the other hand, the minor band at 523 cm-1 remained still obvious. It was suggested that the cytochrome b562-o complex may have an additional anomalous site for CO that is resistant to photodissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1584935236,"In HeLa cells two different types of mutants resistant to the cardiac glycoside ouabain (OuaR mutants) or erythrophleum alkaloid cassaine (CasR mutants) have been obtained. One type of mutants resistant to these compounds (designated as group A) are highly resistant (between 50 and 2000-fold) to various cardiac glycosides and their genins such as ouabain, oleandrin, digitoxin, digitoxigenin, strophanthidin, convallatoxin, gitoxin, gitoxigenin, gitaloxin, bufalin, and digoxigenin, but exhibit no cross-resistance to SC4453, a digoxin analog which contains a pyridazine ring in place of the lactone ring in the C-17 position. The second type of mutants (group B) exhibit cross-resistance to all of the cardiac glycosides including SC4453, but their level of resistance is at least 5-10-fold less than that of group A mutants. Interestingly, both groups of mutants exhibited similar degree of cross-resistance towards digoxin and actodigin (AY22241), indicating some differences in their behavior from other cardiac glycosides. Both classes of mutants exhibit no cross-resistance to a wide variety of other structurally and functionally related compounds, e.g. sanguinarine nitrate, ethacrynic acid, penicillic acid, veratridine, harmaline hydrochloride, 5,5'-diphenylhydantoin, quindonium bromide, methyl quinolizinum bromide, estradiol 17 beta-acetate, 21-acetoxy-pregnenolone, vanadium pentoxide, digitonin, and adriamycin, indicating that the genetic lesions in both groups of mutants are specific for cardiac glycosides. This inference is supported by the observation that both group A and B mutants show reduced binding of [3H]ouabain. In group A mutants, a part of the Na+/K+-ATPase activity is highly resistant to inhibition by ouabain, indicating that the genetic lesion in these mutants directly affects Na+/K+-ATPase. In contrast, the Na+/K+-ATPase from the group B mutants showed similar resistance towards ouabain and SC4453 as observed for the parental HeLa cells, indicating that these mutants are affected in a cellular component, other than Na+/K+-ATPase, which is involved in the interaction of cardiac glycosides with the cells. The lack of cross-resistance of the group A mutants to SC4453 and normal sensitivity of their Na+/K+-ATPase to this compound provides strong evidence that the mechanism of interaction of SC4453 with Na+/K+-ATPase differs from that of other cardiac glycosides."

https://openalex.org/W2010225710,"Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) proviruses integrated within the DNA of transformed rat cells frequently display duplications of variable segments of proviral DNA upstream of an intact provirus. The rearrangement in the A11 clone of transformed rat cells consists of a partial duplication of both viral and cellular DNA segments whose origin is a region of approximately 4 kb encompassing the 3′ virus-cell junction. Transposition of this DNA appears to have occurred at or after virus integration by a mechanism involving at least two recombination events. In every case examined, including A11, the transcriptional organization of the original provirus has been conserved and viral RNA expression appears to occur normally. The frequency of such rearranged proviruses in the DNA of transformed rat cells suggests that upstream rearrangements may influence provirus expression."
https://openalex.org/W1520408098,"We recently reported a TATA box mutation (ATAAAA to ATACAA) in a cloned beta-globin gene from a Kurdish Jew with homozygous beta thalassemia (Poncz, M., Ballantine, M., Solowiejczyk, D., Barak, I., Schwartz, E., and Surrey, S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5994-5996). We have now introduced this gene into HeLa cells after CaPO4 precipitation of the DNA and studied expression by analyzing globin-gene transcripts with a novel S1 nuclease mapping assay. Quantitative and qualitative comparison with the normal beta-globin gene revealed a promoter-down phenotype in the TATA box mutant, with normal RNA processing, and a normal start site for initiation of the primary transcript. Decreased transcriptional efficiency was confirmed directly by analysis of run-off transcripts using assays in vitro. The patient's phenotype of beta thalassemia major is probably the result of two different mutations since haplotype analysis of the beta-like globin gene clusters in genomic DNA from this patient shows heterozygosity for the Mediterranean-type haplotypes I and VII, with the TATA box mutation on a haplotype I chromosomal background."
https://openalex.org/W1551349315,"19F NMR was used to measure intracellular [H+] of hepatocytes before and after incubation with glucagon and adrenergic agonists at their concentrations which give maximal stimulation of both glucose and urea production. Intracellular and extracellular pH was determined from the chemical shifts in resonances of alpha-difluoromethylalanine. The alterations in intracellular [H+] with agonist treatment were, in all cases, found to be less than 0.1 pH unit in the pH range 6.7-7.8. It is concluded that changes in concentration of the intracellular [H+] do not play a significant role in the stimulation of urea and glucose production caused by these hormonal effectors."
