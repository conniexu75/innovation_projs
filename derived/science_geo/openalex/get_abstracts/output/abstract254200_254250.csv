https://openalex.org/W1973101250,"Carbon supercapacitors, which are energy storage devices that use ion adsorption on the surface of highly porous materials to store charge, have numerous advantages over other power-source technologies, but could realize further gains if their electrodes were properly optimized. Studying the effect of the pore size on capacitance could potentially improve performance by maximizing the electrode surface area accessible to electrolyte ions, but until recently, no studies had addressed the lower size limit of accessible pores. Using carbide-derived carbon, we generated pores with average sizes from 0.6 to 2.25 nanometer and studied double-layer capacitance in an organic electrolyte. The results challenge the long-held axiom that pores smaller than the size of solvated electrolyte ions are incapable of contributing to charge storage."

By selectively adjusting the carrier concentration in each layer, changes in the Coulomb potential led to control of the gap between valence and conduction bands. This control over the band structure suggests the potential application of bilayer graphene to switching functions in atomic-scale electronic devices."

https://openalex.org/W1994669668,"Since the 1950s, Heisenberg and others have addressed the problem of how to explain the appearance of countable particles in continuous fields. Stable localized field configurations were searched for an ingredient for a general field theory of elementary particles, but the majority of nonlinear field models were unable to predict them. As an exception, Skyrme succeeded in describing nuclear particles as localized states, so-called 'skyrmions'. Skyrmions are a characteristic of nonlinear continuum models ranging from microscopic to cosmological scales. Skyrmionic states have been found under non-equilibrium conditions, or when stabilized by external fields or the proliferation of topological defects. Examples are Turing patterns in classical liquids, spin textures in quantum Hall magnets, or the blue phases in liquid crystals. However, it has generally been assumed that skyrmions cannot form spontaneous ground states, such as ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order, in magnetic materials. Here, we show theoretically that this assumption is wrong and that skyrmion textures may form spontaneously in condensed-matter systems with chiral interactions without the assistance of external fields or the proliferation of defects. We show this within a phenomenological continuum model based on a few material-specific parameters that can be determined experimentally. Our model has a condition not considered before: we allow for softened amplitude variations of the magnetization, characteristic of, for instance, metallic magnets. Our model implies that spontaneous skyrmion lattice ground states may exist generally in a large number of materials, notably at surfaces and in thin films, as well as in bulk compounds, where a lack of space inversion symmetry leads to chiral interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2072389122,"The ability to control the quantum state of a single electron spin in a quantum dot is at the heart of recent developments towards a scalable spin-based quantum computer. In combination with the recently demonstrated controlled exchange gate between two neighbouring spins, driven coherent single spin rotations would permit universal quantum operations. Here, we report the experimental realization of single electron spin rotations in a double quantum dot. First, we apply a continuous-wave oscillating magnetic field, generated on-chip, and observe electron spin resonance in spin-dependent transport measurements through the two dots. Next, we coherently control the quantum state of the electron spin by applying short bursts of the oscillating magnetic field and observe about eight oscillations of the spin state (so-called Rabi oscillations) during a microsecond burst. These results demonstrate the feasibility of operating single-electron spins in a quantum dot as quantum bits. One of the most promising approaches to realizing a practical quantum bit is to use spin states of single electrons in semiconductor quantum dots. A detailed proposal for such spin qubits was published about ten years ago; since then, all the necessary ingredients to realize it, such as long-lived spin states and the initialization of electron spins, have been reported one by one. Now the last, most difficult step has been accomplished, that of driving coherent spin oscillations for individual electrons, which is necessary to carry out quantum operations. This is achieved by applying oscillating magnetic fields that are resonant with the precession frequencies of the electron spins, generated on-chip near a double quantum dot system. All is now ready to design universal quantum logic gates."

Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of rapidly frozen axonemes from Chlamydomonas and sea urchin sperm, using cryoelectron tomography and image processing to focus on the motor enzyme dynein. Our images suggest a model for the way dynein generates force to slide microtubules. They also reveal two dynein linkers that may provide “hard-wiring” to coordinate motor enzyme action, both circumferentially and along the axoneme. Periodic densities were also observed inside doublet microtubules; these may contribute to doublet stability."

https://openalex.org/W4244506205,"Many industrial applications that rely on emulsions would benefit from an efficient, rapid method of breaking these emulsions at a specific desired stage. We report that long-chain alkyl amidine compounds can be reversibly transformed into charged surfactants by exposure to an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, thereby stabilizing water/alkane emulsions or, for the purpose of microsuspension polymerization, styrene-in-water emulsions. Bubbling nitrogen, argon, or air through the amidinium bicarbonate solutions at 65°C reverses the reaction, releasing carbon dioxide and breaking the emulsion. We also find that the neutral amidines function as switchable demulsifiers of an aqueous crude oil emulsion, enhancing their practical potential."
https://openalex.org/W1966071858,"The ability to generate regular spatial arrangements of particles is an important technological and fundamental aspect of colloidal science. We showed that colloidal particles confined to a few-micrometer-thick layer of a nematic liquid crystal form two-dimensional crystal structures that are bound by topological defects. Two basic crystalline structures were observed, depending on the ordering of the liquid crystal around the particle. Colloids inducing quadrupolar order crystallize into weakly bound two-dimensional ordered structure, where the particle interaction is mediated by the sharing of localized topological defects. Colloids inducing dipolar order are strongly bound into antiferroelectric-like two-dimensional crystallites of dipolar colloidal chains. Self-assembly by topological defects could be applied to other systems with similar symmetry."

https://openalex.org/W2003502718,"Experience can alter synaptic connectivity throughout life, but the degree of plasticity present at each age is regulated by mechanisms that remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Paired-immunoglobulin–like receptor B (PirB), a major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) receptor, is expressed in subsets of neurons throughout the brain. Neuronal PirB protein is associated with synapses and forms complexes with the phosphatases Shp-1 and Shp-2. Soluble PirB fusion protein binds to cortical neurons in an MHCI-dependent manner. In mutant mice lacking functional PirB, cortical ocular-dominance plasticity is more robust at all ages. Thus, an MHCI receptor is expressed in central nervous system neurons and functions to limit the extent of experience-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex throughout life. PirB is also expressed in many other regions of the central nervous system, suggesting that it may function broadly to stabilize neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2087421413,"Anthraquinone molecules self-assemble on a Cu(111) surface into a large two-dimensional honeycomb network ( \batchmode \documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]{article} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amsmath} \pagestyle{empty} \begin{document} \(\sqrt{304}{\times}\sqrt{304}\) \end{document} ) R 23° with pore diameters of ≈50 Å. The spontaneous formation of a pattern containing pores roughly five times larger than the size of the constituent molecules is unprecedented. The network originates from a delicate balance between substrate-mediated repulsion and intermolecular attraction involving an unusual chemical motif: hydrogen bonding between a carbonyl oxygen and an aromatic hydrogen atom. Substrate-mediated long-range adsorbate-adsorbate repulsion has been observed on anisotropic surfaces and in the context of the absence of pattern formation. Its applicability for the design of tailored molecular films is explored here."
https://openalex.org/W2153923367,"Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are a group of inherited disorders of neuromuscular transmission characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. One major subgroup of patients shows a characteristic ""limb girdle"" pattern of muscle weakness, in which the muscles have small, simplified neuromuscular junctions but normal acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase function. We showed that recessive inheritance of mutations in Dok-7, which result in a defective structure of the neuromuscular junction, is a cause of CMS with proximal muscle weakness."

https://openalex.org/W2006611052,"Apart from UCP1-based nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipocytes, the identity of thermogenic mechanisms that can be activated to reduce a positive energy balance is largely unknown. To identify potentially useful mechanisms, we have analyzed physiological and molecular mechanisms that enable mice, genetically deficient in UCP1 and sensitive to acute exposure to the cold at 4 °C, to adapt to long term exposure at 4 °C. UCP1-deficient mice that can adapt to the cold have increased oxygen consumption and show increased oxidation of both fat and glucose as indicated from serum metabolite levels and liver glycogen content. Enhanced energy metabolism in inguinal fat was also indicated by increased oxygen consumption and fat oxidation in tissue suspensions and increased AMP kinase activity in dissected tissues. Analysis of gene expression in skeletal muscle showed surprisingly little change between cold-adapted Ucp1+/+ and Ucp1-/- mice, whereas in inguinal fat a robust induction occurred for type 2 deiodinase, sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, PGC1α, CoxII, and mitochondrial DNA content. Western blot analysis showed an induction of total phospholamban and its phosphorylated form in inguinal fat and other white fat depots, but no induction was apparent in muscle. We conclude that alternative thermogenic mechanisms, based in part upon the enhanced capacity for ion and substrate cycling associated with brown adipocytes in white fat depots, are induced in UCP1-deficient mice by gradual cold adaptation."

https://openalex.org/W2089438832,"A chink in the protection of a caged flock can dramatically increase the chances of a flu outbreak. Concerns have been raised that vaccinating poultry against H5N1 virus could increase the risk of transmission between flocks before outbreaks are detected. A numerical modelling study of caged birds suggests this a valid concern: 'silent spread' could occur in a vaccinated flock if protection is incomplete, even if a vaccine is effective in individual birds. International debate on the merits of vaccinating poultry against the H5N1 influenza A virus1,2,3 has raised concerns about the possibility of an increased risk of between-flock transmission before outbreaks are detected4. Here we show that this 'silent spread' can occur because of incomplete protection at the flock level, even if a vaccine is effective in individual birds. The use of unvaccinated sentinels can mitigate, although not completely eliminate, the problem."
https://openalex.org/W2115268884,"Rhinovirus (RV) is an important trigger of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. In addition, respiratory viruses are more likely to be isolated in patients with a history of frequent exacerbations, suggesting that these patients are more susceptible to viral infection. To examine potential mechanisms for cooperative effects between bacterial and viral infection in COPD, we studied the responses of cultured human airway epithelial cells to nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae and RV. In both 16HBE14o- and primary mucociliary-differentiated cells, preincubation with H. influenzae enhanced RV serotype 39-induced protein expression of interleukin (IL)-8, epithelial-derived neutrophil attractant-78, and growth-related oncogene-alpha. H. influenzae infection also increased the binding of RV39 to cultured cells, as well as expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3, receptors for RV and dsRNA, respectively. Neutralizing antibody against tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibited IL-8 expression induced by H. influenzae and RV39. Finally, siRNA against TLR3 attenuated RV-induced IL-8 expression. We conclude that H. influenzae infection increases airway epithelial cell ICAM-1 and TLR3 expression, leading to enhanced binding of RV and a potentiation of RV-induced chemokine release. These data provide a cellular mechanism by which H. influenzae infection may increase the susceptibility of COPD patients to RV-induced exacerbations."

https://openalex.org/W2126674433,"The recent explosion in genome sequencing has revealed the great diversity of the cadherin superfamily. Within the superfamily, protocadherins, which are expressed mainly in the nervous system, constitute the largest subgroup. Nevertheless, the structures of only the classical cadherins are known. Thus, to broaden our understanding of the adhesion repertoire of the cadherin superfamily, we determined the structure of the N-terminal first extracellular cadherin domain of the cadherin-related neuronal receptor/protocadherin-α4. The hydrophobic pocket essential for homophilic adhesiveness in the classical cadherins was not found, and the functional significance of this structural domain was supported by exchanging the first extracellular cadherin domains of protocadherin and classical cadherin. Moreover, potentially crucial variations were observed mainly in the loop regions. These included the protocadherin-specific disulfide-bonded Cys-X5-Cys motif, which showed Ca2+-induced chemical shifts, and the RGD motif, which has been suggested to be involved in heterophilic cell adhesion via the active form of β1 integrin. Our findings reveal that the adhesion repertoire of the cadherin superfamily is far more divergent than would be predicted by studying the classical cadherins alone.

Our findings reveal that the adhesion repertoire of the cadherin superfamily is far more divergent than would be predicted by studying the classical cadherins alone. In recent years, the cadherins have emerged as an important superfamily, and their structures and biological functions are proving to be complex. Originally thought of as calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules, the cadherin superfamily molecules are now known to be involved in many biological processes, including cell recognition, cell signaling, cell communication during embryogenesis, and the formation of neural circuits in the central nervous system (1Takeichi M.

The cadherin superfamily can be divided into several subgroups (4Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar): the classical (type I) and closely related type II cadherins, the desmosomal cadherins, and the protocadherins (see Fig. 1A). Most of the previous functional and structural analyses have been of the classical cadherins. These studies revealed homophilic adhesive binding interfaces localized primarily within the N-terminal first extracellular cadherin (EC) 6The abbreviations used are: EC, extracellular cadherin; CNR/Pcdhα, cadherin-related neuronal receptor/protocadherin-α; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. domain, which is conserved among the classical (type I), type II, and desmosomal cadherins (5Overduin M.

However, the classical cadherins account for only a fraction of the cadherin superfamily, which has a multitude of diverse members. Protocadherins are now known to constitute the largest subgroup within the cadherin superfamily (see Fig. 1A) (4Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 9Shapiro L. Colman D.R. Neuron. 1999; 23: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 11Patel S.D.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Most protocadherins have a divergent cytoplasmic domain and six or seven EC domains, with low sequence similarities to the EC domains of the classical cadherin group (15Suzuki S.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we have focused on one of the major cluster-type protocadherins, the cadherin-related neuronal receptor/protocadherin-α (CNR/Pcdhα) family. The CNR/Pcdhα genome is organized into an unusual gene cluster that is similar to the organization of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes (see Fig. 1B) (16Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The mouse CNR/Pcdhα gene cluster is composed of 14 variable-region exons and a set of three constantregion exons (17Sugino H. Hamada S. Yasuda R. Tuji A. Matsuda Y. Fujita M. Yagi T. Genomics. 2000; 63: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Wu Q. Zhang T. Cheng J.F. Kim Y. Grimwood J. Schmutz J. Dickson M. Noonan J.P. Zhang M.Q. Myers R.M. Maniatis T. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Mature CNR/Pcdhα mRNAs are generated from one of these variable-region exons and the three constant-region exons, and their differential and combinatorial expression is observed at the individual neuron level (19Kohmura N.

Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Among the six tandemly repeated EC domains of the CNR/Pcdhα protein, the N-terminal EC1 domain shows several unique features. First, the sequence of the EC1 domain is well conserved among mouse CNR/Pcdhα family members (Fig. 1B) (19Kohmura N. Senzaki K. Hamada S. Kai N. Yasuda R. Watanabe M. Ishii H. Yasuda M. Mishina M. Yagi T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1137-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Second, the EC1 domain has a sequence containing the RGD motif, which is known to function in protein-protein interactions. Recently, the RGD motif of the CNR/Pcdhα EC1 domain was shown to be involved in the adhesion activity of the CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1 domain in HEK293T cells, which occurs via β1 integrin (22Mutoh T. Hamada S. Senzaki K. Murata Y. Yagi T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 494-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Third, the CNR/Pcdhα EC1 domain lacks Trp2, which is highly conserved among the classical (type I), type II, and desmosomal cadherins and is critical for their homophilic binding activity (11Patel S.D. Chen C.P. Bahna F. Honig B. Shapiro L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In fact, CNR/Pcdhα appears to possess no homophilic binding activity (22Mutoh T. Hamada S. Senzaki K. Murata Y. Yagi T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 494-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These characteristics of the CNR/Pcdhα EC1 domain raise the possibility that the EC1 domains of the cadherin superfamily, which are thought to be essential for adhesion, may be structurally and functionally rather divergent. However, this issue has been difficult to investigate because no structures of cadherin superfamily EC1 domains, except those of classical cadherins, have been determined. Furthermore, current knowledge about the functions of CNR/Pcdhα is still meager compared with what is known about the classical cadherins. Here, to better understand the adhesion repertoire if the cadherin superfamily and to help elucidate the unknown functions of the CNR/Pcdhα family proteins, we determined the solution structure of the CNR/Pcdhα4 N-terminal EC1 domain by NMR. We further investigated the function of the domain on the basis of its determined structure. NMR Sample Preparation—The DNA encoding the EC1 domain of mouse CNR/Pcdhα4 (Glu1-Asn103) was amplified by PCR from mouse CNR/Pcdhα4 cDNA and subcloned into the pET-11d vector (Novagen). The recombinant protein was expressed from the resulting plasmid, which contained an additional methionine at the N terminus. The CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1 domain was labeled uniformly with stable 15N and 13C isotopes and expressed by culturing the bacteria (strain BL21(DE3)) in M9 minimal medium containing 1.0 g/liter d-[U-13C]glucose and 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. For expression of the 15N-labeled sample, 1.0 g/liter d-glucose instead of [13C]glucose was added to M9 minimal medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with shaking, and protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and culturing overnight. The protein was purified as described (23Tsumoto K. Shinoki K. Kondo H. Uchikawa M. Juji T. Kumagai I. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 219: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The solvent for the purified protein solution was exchanged with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 80 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 0.3 mm Pefabloc, and 8% (v/v) D2O by ultrafiltration (Ultra-4, Amicon). The final concentration of the protein was ∼0.1 mm. The sample solution was sealed in a 5-mm Shigemi microtube (CMS-005B) with a cylindrical piston. To confirm that the recombinant protein used for the structural analyses was functional, we used it in an assay that detects the cell adhesion activity of the CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1 domain. Our previous study showed that the CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1-Fc fusion protein produced by mammalian cells possesses adhesion activity for parental HEK293T cells (22Mutoh T. Hamada S. Senzaki K. Murata Y. Yagi T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 494-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the same assay system, the recombinant CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1 domain also adhered to HEK293T cells (data not shown), indicating that the recombinant protein used in the structural analyses kept its physiologically and functionally active conformation. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra for the resonance assignments of the main chain and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) were acquired at 303 K with a Bruker DRX-800 NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance (1H, 15N, and 13C) cryogenic probe with a z axis gradient coil. Spectra for the side chain assignments were acquired with a DRX-500 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe with a self-shielded triple axis gradient coil. Resonance Assignments—To assign the 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances, a series of two- and three-dimensional experiments were performed. These were 15N-1H HSQC-wg, 13C-1H HSQC-se, and 1H-1H TOCSY with a mixing time of 57.6 ms; 15N-edited TOCSY-se with a mixing time of 69.0 ms; and HNCO-wg, HN(CA)CO-se, CBCA(CO)NH-se, HNCACB-wg, HBHA(CBCACO)NH-se, C(CO)NH-se, H(CCO)NH-se, and HCCH TOCSY with mixing times of 20.2 ms each, where “wg” refers to the WATERGATE and water flip-back method and “se” refers to the sensitivity enhancement and gradient echo method (24Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). In the NMR experiments in which amide protons were detected directly, the spectral width of the 15N dimension was set to 14.0 ppm. The 1H carrier was set at the frequency of the residual water resonance (4.7 ppm), and the 15N carrier was set at 121.0 ppm. The acquisition times were 20 and 71 ms for the 15N and 1H dimensions, respectively, independent of the scales of the static magnetic fields applied. The other indirect dimensions were acquired using the TPPI-States method (24Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). All data were processed with the program NMRPipe (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). The assignment results and accompanying details have been described elsewhere (26Umitsu M. Morishita H. Murata Y. Udaka K. Akutsu H. Yagi T. Ikegami T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 31: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and deposited in the BioMagResBank under accession number 6405. A number of resonances were missing in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Gly1, Asn2, Ser3, Glu12, His15, Lys43, Gly46, Glu67, Glu68, Arg72, Ala74, Cys76, and Asp102), probably because of rapid amide proton exchanges with the solvent at pH 8.0 and conformational exchanges (26Umitsu M. Morishita H. Murata Y. Udaka K. Akutsu H. Yagi T. Ikegami T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 31: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Samples prepared at a low pH (6.0-7.0) immediately formed precipitates, which prevented us from detecting amide resonances for these residues. Relaxation analyses for amide 15N spins were performed as described (27Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E.

Structural Restraints and Calculations—To obtain interproton distance restraints, two-dimensional NOESY, three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY, and 13C-edited NOESY with mixing times of 100 ms each were acquired. The NOE connectivities derived from strong, medium, and weak cross-peaks were categorized and assumed to correspond to the upper limits for the interproton distances of 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 Å, respectively (26Umitsu M. Morishita H. Murata Y. Udaka K. Akutsu H. Yagi T. Ikegami T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 31: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The distance restraints for the hydrogen bonds were applied for the amides that were judged to form a β strand on the basis of the characteristic NOE patterns and the φ and ψ dihedral angles predicted using the software TALOS (29Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar), using 2.8-3.3 Å for nitrogen-oxygen pairs and 1.8-2.3 Å for hydrogen-oxygen pairs, after the root mean square deviations for the overlaid backbone nuclei of calculated structures reached 1.0 Å. The backbone torsion angles were predicted using TALOS (29Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar), with chemical shifts of 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13Co, 1Hα, and 15N. The restraints for the backbone φ and ψ dihedral angles were applied as the mean ± two or three times the S.D. as long as TALOS categorized the corresponding angles as “Good” and “New,” respectively. The methyl pairs of all 12 leucine and all 11 valine residues were assigned stereospecifically using 15% fractionally 13C-labeled protein (30Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The structures were calculated with the software CYANA 2.1 by molecular dynamics in a torsion angle space with 20,000 steps (31Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). The parameters were set at the default values of CYANA, except for the pseudoatom corrections, which were applied to the upper bound restraints involving methyl, methylene, and aromatic ring protons as described previously (32Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The best 30 structures of 100 calculated were analyzed with MOLMOL (33Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29-32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6496) Google Scholar) and AQUA and PROCHECKNMR (34Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4468) Google Scholar) software. Preparation of Fc Fusion Proteins for Functional Assays—The cDNAs of full-length mouse N-cadherin and CNR/Pcdhα4 were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and subcloned into the pBS vector. The CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1/N-cadherin EC2-5 (CNREC1/Ncad) and N-cadherin EC1/CNR/Pcdhα EC2-5 (NcadEC1/CNR) chimeric constructs were generated by PCR ligation from the full-length N-cadherin and CNR/Pcdhα4 constructs. The N-cadherin EC1-5-Fc (Ncad-Fc), N-cadherin (signal sequence + prodomain)-Fc (Fc), CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1-6-Fc (CNR/Pcdhα-Fc), CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1-Fc, CNREC1/Ncad-Fc, and NcadEC1/CNR-Fc constructs were derived from the full-length N-cadherin, CNR/Pcdhα4, and CNREC1/Ncad chimeric constructs, described above, by PCR to amplify the entire extracellular domains or smaller regions and subsequently subcloned into the pIB/Fc vector (a gift from Dr. Zipurksy, UCLA) via NotI/SpeI sites. These constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 via NotI/XbaI sites for mammalian cell expression. The chimeric Fc proteins used for the aggregation and cell adhesion assays were purified from HEK293T cells as follows. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% ultra low protein fetal bovine serum. After 1 week in culture, the cleared medium was incubated overnight with nProtein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) to capture the Fc-tagged proteins. The Protein A beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, applied to an open column, eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.8), and subsequently neutralized with 1 m Tris (pH 9.5). Bead Aggregation Assay—Bead aggregation was assayed by a modification of a method described previously (35Wojtowicz W.M. Flanagan J.J. Millard S.S. Zipursky S.L. Clemens J.C. Cell. 2004; 118: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In brief, mouse anti-human IgG Fc (Chemicon International) was passively absorbed to red fluorescent microspheres (0.39-μm beads; Duke Scientific Corp.). The IgG-coupled beads were washed with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl and 5% fetal bovine serum and then with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma). One microliter of IgG-coupled beads was coated with purified Fc-tagged protein (250 nm in a volume of 100 μl) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% BSA overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Following capture of the chimeric Fc proteins, the beads were sonicated for 5 min in an ice-bath cup horn (Misonix) in polystyrene tubes. The beads were then incubated at 25 °C with shaking (1400 rpm). At various time points, 3-μl aliquots of the beads were transferred into 600 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% BSA, and 20,000 events were analyzed by FACS (EPICS ALTRA, Beckman Coulter). Following the FACS analysis, 4 μl of beads were spotted onto a glass microslide for visualization. To assess the levels of Fc-tagged proteins on the beads, the beads were pelleted after the FACS analysis; washed twice with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% BSA; boiled in SDS sample buffer; and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, with subsequent immunoblotting using anti-Fc antibody. All of the protein-coated beads used in the assay were found to contain equivalent levels of purified proteins (see Fig. 5C). Cell Adhesion Assay—Microtiter plates (96-well; Nunc) were coated with each protein (200 nm) dissolved in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, and Hanks' balanced saline solution at 40 μl/well for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. The wells were subsequently washed twice with Hanks' balanced saline solution and then blocked with 1% BSA and phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 2 h. HEK293T cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected and washed with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, and 0.1% BSA. The pellets were suspended again at 1 × 105 cells/ml. Aliquots of the cell suspension were placed on the test dishes with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. To activate β1 integrin, antibody TS2/16 was added at 10 μg/ml for 15 min before plating. The plated cells were incubated for 20 min and photographed by a camera fitted onto a microscope (Olympus IX70/DP50 system). The attached cells were counted in two independent fields per well. Overall Structure of the EC1 Domain of CNR/Pcdhα and Comparison with Those of Other Cadherins—The solution structure of the CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1 domain was determined by multidimensional double and triple resonance NMR spectroscopy. The stability of the protein could be maintained only at a low protein concentration of 0.1 mm and a high pH of 8.0, conditions that are generally not suitable for NMR measurements. We overcame this problem by using a high magnetic field NMR spectrometer (800 MHz) with a cryogenic probe. The structure was practically determined from the distance, torsion angle, and hydrogen bond restraints listed in Table 1. An overlay of the final 30 structures, which exhibited the best target functions of 100 calculated structures, showed that the coordinates of the backbone atoms were well defined (Fig. 2A). The average root mean square deviations for these structures were 0.63 Å for the backbone (0.25 Å when limited to the β strand regions) and 1.19 Å for all heavy atoms (0.81 Å for the β strand regions). The detailed statistics for the best 30 structures are also listed in Table 1.TABLE 1NMR structural statistics for the CNR/Pcdhα EC1 domainTotal no. of distance restraints1100Intraresidual463Sequential |i - j| = 1211Medium range |i - j| ≤ 493Long range |i - j| > 4333Hydrogen bonds40Disulfide bond1No. of dihedral angle restraints185Distance restraint violations >0.5 Å0Dihedral angle restraint violations >5°0van der Waals distance violations >0.5 Å0r.m.s. deviations from experimental restraintsDistance (Å)0.0170 ± 0.0012Angle0.4107 ± 0.0579°PROCHECK Ramachandran plot statistics (residues 1-103; %)Residues in most favored regions77.8Residues in additional allowed regions21.1Residues in generously allowed regions1.1Residues in disallowed regions0.0r.m.s. deviations from mean coordinate positionsFull-length (residues 1-103, Å)Backbone heavy atoms0.631 ± 0.128All heavy atoms1.185 ± 0.116Secondary structure regions (residues 4-10, 18-20, 38-41, 49-51, 58-60, 77-84, and 89-98; Å)Backbone heavy atoms0.251 ± 0.067All heavy atoms0.814 ± 0.102 Open table in a new tab The EC1 domain of CNR/Pcdhα4 has the Greek key topology of a β sandwich-like structure containing two β sheets that are packed face to face (Fig. 2). One sheet is composed of four β strands (βA, βC, βF, and βG), and the other is composed of three β strands (βB, βD, and βE). All strands are arranged antiparallel, except for the parallel pairing between βA and βG. Three loops that are spatially close to the N terminus (loops BC, DE, and FG) and three that are close to the C terminus (loops AB, CD, and EF) connect the corresponding pairs of β strands. The β sandwich scaffold is stabilized by an extensive hydrogen bond network between neighboring β strands and by a hydrophobic core formed by inwardly facing residues from the β sheets (Fig. 2A). The coordinates of the residues forming the hydrophobic core are well defined in the final structures. Of the three aromatic residues (Tyr7, Phe38, and Phe91) contained in the hydrophobic core, Tyr7 is conserved among protocadherin family members. Despite low sequence similarities between the EC1 domains of CNR/Pcdhα4 and the classical cadherins (30% at the maximum), the overall topology of the CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1 domain is similar to that of classical cadherin domains in that both contain seven β strands, and the corresponding β strands have similar lengths (Fig. 3). Potentially crucial variations between the structures of the EC1 domains of CNR/Pcdhα4 and the classical cadherins are found mainly in the loop regions. Significant differences in the lengths of the loop regions between β strands were demonstrated by aligning the sequences on the basis of the positions of their corresponding β strands (Fig. 3A). First, loop BC of the CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1 domain is longer and contains more hydrophobic residues than the domains of classical cadherins, whereas loop FG is shorter. In the homophilic interaction between classical cadherins, these two loops form and surround the hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the N-terminal Try2 residue of the other EC1 domain. Second, loop CD of the CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1 domain is much shorter than loop CD of classical cadherins, which has a quasi-β helix conformation. Instead, loop CD of the CNR/Pcdhα EC1 domain contains the RGD motif, which is known to be a consensus sequence in integrin interactions. Third, a Cys-X5-Cys sequence, which is not found in classical cadherins, is inserted into loop EF of the CNR/Pcdhα EC1 domain. Interestingly, we found that the Cys-X5-Cys sequence forms a disulfide bond between Cys70 and Cys76 in loop EF (Fig. 2, B and C). This bond was strongly predicted by the characteristic chemical shift values of the α- and β-carbons of the associated cysteine residues (36Sharma D. Rajarathnam K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the CNR/Pcdhα4 EC1 protein (data not shown). Calcium Binding Property of the CNR/Pcdhα EC1 Domain—Like all classical cadherins, the conserved calcium-binding sites of the CNR/Pcdhα EC1 domain (Glu11, Asp65-Arg-Glu67, and Asp99-X-Asn-Asp-Asn103) are clustered near the C terminus, close to the linker region between the EC1 and EC2 domains (Figs. 2B and 4D). A comparison of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the CNR/Pcdhα EC1 domain in the presence and absence of calcium ions in solution (1.5 mm) exhibited calcium-induced chemical shift changes in a subset of cross-peaks, including those of Glu11, Arg66, and Asp99. These sites match well with the conserved calcium-binding regions mentioned above. Calcium-induced chemical shift changes were also seen for other residues in the region surrounding these sites (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, calcium-induced resonance shifts were also observed for the cross-peaks from the Cys70, Gly71, and Ser73 amides forming the disulfide-bonded loop Cys70-Gly-Arg-Ser-Ala-Glu-Cys76 (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the disulfide-bonded loop is spatially located very close to the clusters of calcium-binding residues near the C terminus (Fig. 4D). As the Cys-X5-Cys sequence is conserved among the cluster-type protocadherin families (Pcdhα, Pcdhβ, and Pcdhγ) (Fig. 4C) and among other non-cluster-type protocadherins (protocadherin-8, Arcadlin), but no in classical cadherins, Cys-X5-Cys may be an additional novel calcium-binding motif unique to the protocadherin family. Previous analyses of the crystal structures of the EC1 and EC2 domains of E-cadherin (37Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M.

Recently, we found that P. gingivalis LPS activated the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) through the IκB kinase complex (IKK). NF-κB is a transcription factor that controls inflammation and host responses. In this study, we examined the role of IKK/NF-κBin P. gingivalis LPS-induced gene expression on a genome-wide basis using a combination of microarray and biochemical approaches. A total of 88 early response genes were found to be induced by P. gingivalis LPS in a human THP.1 monocytic cell lines. Interestingly, the induction of most of these genes was abolished or attenuated under the inactivation of IKK/NF-κB. Among those IKK/NF-κB-dependent genes, 20 genes were NF-κB-inducible genes reported previously, and 59 genes represented putative novel NF-κB target genes. Using transcription factor binding analysis, we found that most of these putative NF-κB target genes contained one or multiple NF-κB-binding sites. Also, some transcription factor-binding motifs were overrepresented in the promoter of both known and putative NF-κB-dependent genes, indicating that these genes may be regulated in a similar fashion. Furthermore, we found that several transcription factors associated with metabolic and inflammatory responses, including nuclear receptors, activator of protein-1, and early growth responses, were induced by P. gingivalis LPS through IKK/NF-κB, indicating that IKK/NF-κB may utilize these transcription factors to mediate secondary responses. Taken together, our results demonstrate that IKK/NF-κB signaling plays a dominant role in P. gingivalis LPS-induced early response gene expression, suggesting that IKK/NF-κB is a therapeutic target for periodontitis.

Porphy-romonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative bacterium that is recognized as one of the etiologic agents of periodontitis. Periodontitis impinges on a large proportion of the population and is characterized by alveolar bone resorption, ultimately resulting in tooth loss.

Interestingly, whereas LPS isolated from Gram-negative bacteria usually utilizes TLR4 to stimulate intracellular signaling pathways, P. gingivalis LPS has been shown to utilize TLR-4 and/or TLR-2 to facilitate cell activation (2Southerland J.H.

NF-κB was originally identified as a transcription activator that bound to a specific DNA motif (GGGGACTTCCC) in the intronic enhancer of the immunoglobulin κ light chain gene in B lymphocytes. Subsequently, it was found that NF-κB was a ubiquitous cellular factor that was retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitory proteins IκBs. NF-κB consists of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of the Rel family proteins, including p50, p52, p65/RelA, c-Rel, and RelB. In mammalian cells, the most widely distributed κB-binding activity is a heterodimer of p50 and p65/RelA proteins, in which the p65/RelA subunit has potent transactivation activity (17Chang J.

The IKK complex is critical for NF-κB activation induced by LPS and proinflammatory cytokines. The IKK complex is mainly composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and IKKγ (also known as NF-κB essential modulator), a scaffold molecule without catalytic activity (17Chang J. Zhang C.

Gene depletion studies demonstrate that IKKβ, but not IKKα, plays an essential role in NF-κB activation mediated by LPS and proinflammatory cytokines (18Ghosh S. Karin K. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Although IKKγ lacks catalytic function, it plays a critical role in assembling the IKK complex. Gene knock-out experiments found that IKKγ was essential for IKK activation induced by proinflammatory cytokines and LPS (18Ghosh S. Karin K. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). IKKγ contains several predicted functional domains, including two coiled-coil regions that are separated by α helices, a leucine zipper motif, and a putative zinc finger domain at the C terminus.

Recently, we examined the zinc finger domain of IKKγ and found that C417R mutation in IKKγ zinc finger domain impaired LPS- or TNF-mediated IKK activation and NF-κB transcription. The overexpression of IKKγC417R inhibited the expression of IKK/NF-κB-dependent genes, such as IL-8, in a dominant negative fashion (15Yang F. Wang C.-Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2446-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Tang E. Wang C.-Y. Xiong Y. Guan K. J. Biol.

To further understand bacterial infection-mediated host response and inflammation, we examined P. gingivalis LPS-induced genes in human monocytes on a genome-wide basis. Using the dominant-negative approach to block IKK/NF-κB signaling, we compare gene expression patterns induced by P. gingivalis LPS in monocytes. We found that most of the early response genes induced by P. gingivalis LPS were dependent on IKK/NF-κB, suggesting that IKK/NF-κBisa therapeutic target for periodontitis. Cell Culture and Retroviral Infection—Human THP.1 monocytes and murine RAW264.7 macrophages (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. LPS from P. gingivalis 7346 was provided by Dr. Ronald Arnold (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). A specific IKKβ inhibitor, IKKVI, was purchased from Calbiochem. For isolation and culture of primary mouse macrophages from bone marrow, C57BL/6j mice were sacrificed and sterilized with 70% alcohol. Under an aseptic condition, femurs were collected and cut with scissors. The bone marrow was flushed with medium using a syringe. Bone marrow cells were transferred to 100-mm tissue culture plates. Nonadherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were maintained for subsequent experiments. To generate human THP.1 cells stably expressing the dominant negative mutant of IKKγ (IKKγ-DN), we utilized retrovirus-mediated transduction, as reported previously (14Yang F. Tang E. Guan K. Wang C.-Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5630-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 15Yang F. Wang C.-Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2446-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Chen S.

Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with the retroviral vectors encoding IKKγ-DN or control empty vector using the calcium phosphate method. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 0.01 m sodium butyrate (Sigma) overnight to boost retrovirus production. Retrovirus-containing supernatants were collected 48 h later, filtered, and stored at -70 °C. Human THP.1 monocytes were infected with retroviruses in the presence of 6 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). 48 h after infection, cells were treated with G418 (600 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. The resistant cells were pooled, and cells expressing IKKγ-DN were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Human THP.1 monocytes were treated with P. gingivalis LPS (500 ng/ml) for different time periods. Cells were harvested and washed once with cold PBS. Cells were pelleted and lysed with cell lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1:100 protease inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). The protein concentration was measured according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). 50-μg aliquots of whole cell lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a semidry gel transfer cell. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C and incubated with the primary antibodies. The immunocomplexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Promega) using the SuperSignal reagents (Pierce), as described previously (26Chen S. Guttridge D.C. You Z. Zhang Z. Fribley A. Mayo M.W. Kitajewski J. Wang C.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 27Chen S. Fribley A. Wang C.-Y. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 81: 98-102Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were from the following sources: anti-IκBα, anti-ATF-3, anti-c-Fos, and anti-Fra-1 polyclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-IκBα (serine 32) antibodies from Cell Signaling; and anti-α-tubulin from Sigma. Affymetrix Human Microarray—Cells were treated with P. gingivalis LPS for 1 h. After treatment, cells were harvested, and total RNAs were extracted with Trizol reagents in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). To eliminate contaminated genomic DNA, total RNAs were cleaned with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 10-μg aliquots of total RNA from each sample were utilized for microarray analysis as described previously (28Fribley A. Zeng Q. Wang C.-Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9695-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNAs were transcribed to double-stranded cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with an oligo(dT) primer that has a T7 RNA polymerase site on the 5′-end. Then, the cDNAs were used in an in vitro transcription reaction in the presence of biotin-modified ribonucleotides to generate single-stranded RNAs. The biotin-labeled RNAs were fragmented and hybridized with an Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) human U133A gene chip at 45 °C for 16 h in a mix that contained 10 μg of fragmented RNA, 6× SSPE, 0.005% Triton X-100, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA in a total volume of 200 μl. Labeled bacterial RNAs were spiked into the hybridization mix for an internal standard and normalization. Chips were washed and stained with Streptavidin R-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The arrays were scanned with the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). Signal intensity was calculated using the one-step Tukey's biweight estimate (28Fribley A. Zeng Q. Wang C.-Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9695-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Affymetrix® Microarray Suite 5.0 was used for data analysis. Scaling was performed to facilitate the comparison of multiple arrays. We chose a target intensity of 500 in scaling. The Microarray Suite 5.0 detection algorithm generates a detection p value from probe pair intensities and assigns a present (p), marginal (M), or absent (A) call to each probe set. We applied the default cut-off value of 0.04 (i.e. a p value under 0.04 indicates a P call). The Microarray Suite change algorithm utilized Wilcoxon's signed rank test to compare each probe set on the experiment array with its counterpart on the base-line array, and a change p value was calculated. We assigned increase (I)(p < 0.0025), decrease (D)(p > 0.9975), or no change call (NC)(p between 0.0025 and 0.9975) to each probe set. Significant increase was assigned to a probe set if it had a detection call of P on experiment array, a change call of I, and a -fold change of at least 2. In the same way, significant decrease was assigned to a probe set if it had a detection of P on base-line array, a change call of D, and a -fold change of 0.5 or lower. Gene Function Annotation—Gene Ontology (GO) terms for genes were obtained from the hgu74av2 and mgu74av2 package of bioconductor (29Gentleman R.C. Carey V.J. Bates D.M. Bolstad B. Dettling M.

Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNAs were isolated using Trizol reagent. 2-μg aliquots of total RNAs from each sample were subjected to reverse transcription using a Superscript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative real time PCR was performed on an iCycler (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human primers used for THP-1 cells were as follows: egr-1, 5′-TTCGGATCCTTTCCTCACTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTGCTCAGCAGCATCATCT-3′ (reverse); egr-2, 5′-GAGTTGGGTCTCCAGGTTGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACCGGGTAGATGTTGTCAG-3′ (reverse); egr-3, 5′-CCAACCCGGAACTCTCTTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGGCGAACTTTCCCAAGTA-3′ (reverse); pnrc1, 5′-TGCCACTAACCAAGATCACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTGATTTCTTCAAATGCGA-3′ (reverse); nr4a1, 5′-AGAAAGAGCTTGAGGTGGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTGGAAGGAGGGTAGGAAG-3′ (reverse); nr4a2, 5′-GACCCACAAGTATTGCCCTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCTTTGCCTTCTTCAACTC-3′ (reverse). The mouse primers used for RAW 264.7 were as follows: egr-1, 5′-AACCCTATGAGCACCTGACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCGTTTGGCTGGGATAACT-3′ (reverse); egr-2, 5′-CAGACTCAGCCTGAACTGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAATGCTGAAGGATCCTGGT-3′ (reverse); egr-3, 5′-TCGGTAGCCCATTACAATCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAAGAGAGTTCCGGATTGGG-3′ (reverse); pnrc1, 5′-CTCCTCAAGGTGCAGACCTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCACTGCTGTATCCGTTTCC-3′ (reverse); nr4a1, 5′-CAGCTTGGGTGTTGATGTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCAGTGATGAGGACCAGAGC-3′ (reverse); nr4a2, 5′-ATCTCCTGACCGGCTCTATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGGTTGGACCTGTATGCTA-3′ (reverse). The cyclic parameters were as follows: 95 °C for 15 min and amplification at 95 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 40 cycles. Melting curves were analyzed to control for specificity of PCRs. The cumulative fluorescence for each amplicon was normalized to that seen with 18 S RNA amplification. The relative units were calculated from a standard curve, plotting three different concentrations against the PCR cycle number. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—THP.1 cells were fixed in formaldehyde and lysed in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Chromatin was sheared by sonication (3 × 30sat 30% maximum potency). Lysates were centrifuged to pellet debris and then diluted 1:10 in ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 167 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm EDTA). Extracts were precleared for 15 min with 20 μl of a 50% suspension of salmon sperm-saturated protein A. Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies (anti-p65) or IgG antibody (control). Immune complexes were collected with protein A and sequentially washed with low salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl), high salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), LiCl immune complex buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA), and TE buffer. Immune complexes were extracted in 1× TE containing 1% SDS, and protein-DNA cross-links were reverted by heating at 65 °C overnight. After proteinase K digestion (100 μg; 1 h at 50 °C), DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and then ethanol-precipitated. Immunoprecipitated DNA was subjected to real time PCR using primers specific to the human egr-2 promoter (-1326 to -1444), which contains a putative NF-κB-binding site: sense, 5′-GGGTTGTCAAAGGAATTACC-3′; antisense, 5′-CGTCACTTCTAGACCCACCA-3′. The cumulative fluorescence for each amplicon was normalized to input amplification. Inhibition of P. gingivalis LPS-induced IKK Activation by Overexpression of IKKγ Dominant Negative Mutant (IKKγ-DN)—Previously, we have found that the overexpression of IKKγC417R could act as a dominant negative mutant to inhibit TNF- and LPS-mediated IKK activation and NF-κB transcription in human THP.1 monocytic cells (15Yang F. Wang C.-Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2446-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, human THP.1 cells expressing IKKγ-DN were not very stable. After prolonged passages, we found that the level of IKKγ-DN was significantly reduced and was not sufficient to inhibit the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway. Therefore, to globally examine IKK/NF-κB-dependent genes, we prepared fresh THP.1 cells expressing IKKγ-DN. The pooled clones from retrovirus-mediated infection were utilized in order to minimize artifacts due to clonal variation. As shown in Fig. 1A, Western blot analysis detected IKKγ-DN in THP.1 cells infected with retroviruses expressing HA-IKKγ-DN but not control empty vector. To confirm that IKKγ-DN functionally suppressed IKK activation, both THP.1 cells expressing IKKγ-DN (THP.1/IKKγ-DN) and control cells (THP.1/V) were treated with P. gingivalis LPS. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, although P. gingivalis LPS rapidly induced the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα by activating IKK activities in THP.1/V cells, the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα was inhibited in THP.1/IKKγ-DN cells. Also, P. gingivalis LPS-induced NF-κB transcription was inhibited in THP.1/IKKγ-DN cells using a κB-dependent luciferase reporter assay (data not shown). P. gingivalis LPS-induced Genes in Monocytes by Microarray Analysis—Next, we utilized these cells to globally compare IKK/NF-κB-dependent genes induced by P. gingivalis LPS in monocytes. Both THP.1/IKKγ-DN and THP.1/V cells were treated with P. gingivalis LPS for 1 h only so that we could examine the primary IKK/NF-κB-dependent genes induced by P. gingivalis LPS. After treatment, total RNAs were extracted and assayed using an Affymetrix human gene chips U133A. Affymetrix® Microarray Suite 5.0 was used for data analysis. Genes that were differentially expressed between THP.1/V cells and THP.1/IKKγC417R cells were compared following P. gingivalis LPS stimulation. An overview of -fold changes of these genes (≥2-fold) was shown in Fig. 2A. Compared with untreated cells, we found that P. gingivalis LPS significantly induced 88 genes by ≥2-fold in THP.1/V cells. Although only 10% of these genes (nine genes) were not affected, the -fold induction of 90% of these genes (79 genes) was inhibited or reduced in THP.1/IKKγ-DN cells compared with THP.1/V cells following P. gingivalis LPS stimulation (Fig. 2B). Among those genes that were up-regulated upon P. gingivalis LPS stimulation in THP/V cells, almost 72% of them remained unchanged upon P. gingivalis LPS stimulation in THP.1/IKKγ-DN cells. Although another 18% were up-regulated in THP/IKKγ-DN, most of them were induced with a smaller -fold change compared with THP.1/V cells. Since we previously showed that overexpression of IKKγ-DN severely inhibited LPS-induced IKK activation and NF-κB transcription in a dominant-negative fashion (15Yang F. Wang C.-Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2446-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), both of these sets of genes were considered as NF-κB-dependent genes. However, we observed that only five genes (two SEC23A, HMGA1, ARHGDIA, and LOC40257) were repressed by P. gingivalis LPS, suggesting that it mainly induces gene transcription during early gene responses. Taken together, our results suggest that P. gingivalis LPS predominantly utilizes IKK/NF-κB signaling to induce primary gene responses. Previously, we demonstrated that the overexpression of IKKγ-DN did not affect the expression of IKKα, IKKβ, and p65, which are the signaling components of NF-κB (15Yang F. Wang C.-Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2446-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistently, o"
https://openalex.org/W1966011414,We have measured the quantum yield for exciting the motion of a single Co atom in CoCu n linear molecules constructed on a Cu(111) surface. The Co atom switched between two lattice positions during electron excitation from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. The tip location with highest probability for inducing motion was consistent with the position of an active state identified through electronic structure calculations. Atom motion within the molecule decreased with increased molecular length and reflected the corresponding variation in electronic structure.

Specific combinations of septins can hetero-oligomerize and form filaments in vivo and in vitro, by mechanisms that are not understood. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, size exclusion chromatography, and multi-angle light scattering techniques, we have characterized the conformation of a complex of filamentous human septins, Sept2, Sept6, and Sept7. We now show that Sept6 and Sept7 interact through a parallel coiled-coil, and that Sept2 interacts with Sept6 through their C-terminal domains. We have also been able to produce soluble, stable individual septins that behave as rod-like monomers and dimers. Taken together, these observations suggest that polymerized filaments could be comprised of laterally arranged septin core subunits.

However, the molecular mechanisms of filament formation and regulation are poorly understood, and it remains unclear whether septins are predominantly organized in filaments within cells or exist mostly in smaller, lower order assemblies. In many cell types, septins frequently decorate actin microfilaments and/or microtubules and appear fibrous, but are not necessarily filaments and might merely be reflecting the structures of the cytoskeletal elements to which they are attached. The reason why septins polymerize is also unclear, because individual septins can interact independently with other binding partners (7Kremer B.E. Haystead T. Macara I.G. Mol. Biol.

Biochemical studies have isolated at least three complexes: Sept4/5/8 (19Martinez C. Sanjuan M.A. Dent J.A. Karlsson L. Ware J. Biochem.

Clues to mammalian septin polymerization might be found in the septins of lower eukaryotes and non-vertebrates. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains seven septin genes, with Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, Cdc12, Shs1 being involved in mitosis and Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, Spr3, Spr28 involved in sporulation (20Versele M.

In flies, Pnut, Sep2, and Sep1 appear to be organized into hexamers, in a 2:2:2 stoichiometry, which can link together to form extended filaments (25Field C.M. al-Awar O. Rosenblatt J. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In all these cases the structural unit is composed of multiple types of septin, and assembly appears to be independent of guanine nucleotide exchange or hydrolysis. Strikingly, only one report describes the assembly of filaments from a single septin, XSept2, which displayed GTP-dependent polymerization (26Mendoza M. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1858-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In all cases, it remains to be established whether the septin filaments are polarized or are longitudinally symmetric. Given the diversity of complexes that have been described, and the fact that mammalian septins do not have obvious orthologs of septins in lower eukaryotes (27Macara I.G. Baldarelli R. Field C.M. Glotzer M. Hayashi Y. Hsu S.C. Kennedy M.B. Kinoshita M. Longtine M. Low C. Maltais L.J. McKenzie L. Mitchison T.J. Nishikawa T. Noda M. Petty E.M. Peifer M. Pringle J.R. Robinson P.J. Roth D.

Cell. 2002; 13: 4111-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it is possible that many distinct oligomeric septin structures have arisen during eukaryote evolution, that nevertheless retain a similar core organization. It is important, therefore, to address directly the assembly instructions for a well characterized mammalian septin complex. Previous studies (4Kinoshita M. Field C.M. Coughlin M.L. Straight A.F.

In this study, we examine the conformation of the Sept2/6/7 complex and its individual constituent septins using FRET, size exclusion chromatography, and multi-angle light scattering. We propose that a core unit consists of a parallel coiled-coil interaction between Sept6 and Sept7. The C terminus of Sept2 also interacts specifically with the C terminus of Sept6, and this interaction requires full-length Sept2 protein. When Sept6, Sept7, and Sept2 are individually expressed in Escherichia coli, they behave as rod-like monomers and dimers. These observations suggest a lateral arrangement of core subunits within a polymerized filament. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Septin N- and C-terminal fragments were expressed as CFP 2The abbreviations used are: CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer. or YFP fusion proteins in COS-7 cells by transient transfection using calcium phosphate or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) reagent. Cells were lysed after 48 h in 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mm MgSO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and homogenized by passage through a 26-gauge needle. Lysates were clarified by spinning at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained by diluting lysates in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5 and 100 mm MgSO4 on a Spex Fluorolog-tau-3 spectrofluorometer, using a 5-mm rectangular quartz cuvette (25 °C). Excitation occurred at 433 nm (slit width 4 nm), and emission was monitored between 450–550 nm (slit width 4 nm). Western Blots—Proteins to be detected by Western blot were transferred onto nitrocellulose and blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween-20, and 5% dry milk for at least 1 h. YFP and CFP fusion proteins were detected by blotting with a monoclonal GFP antibody (Covance) at 1:1000 dilution and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) used at 1:5000 dilution. Visualization was enhanced by chemiluminescence (KPL). Endogenous Sept2 was visualized using polyclonal antibodies generated and described previously (7Kremer B.E. Haystead T. Macara I.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4648-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), used at 1:1000 dilution. In Vitro Binding Assays—Septins were produced by in vitro transcription translation, using the TnT-coupled Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Myc epitopes were immunoprecipitated by incubating monoclonal 9E10 antibody with wheat germ extracts expressing 35S-labeled Myc-Sept6cc or Myc-Sept7cc for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein-G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with 200 volumes of wash buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mm MgSO4, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 150 mm sucrose). Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and enhanced for fluorography using Amplify (GE Biosciences). For pull-down assays, wheat germ extracts expressing 35S-labeled Myc-Sept6cc or Myc-Sept7cc were incubated with GST or GST-Sept2-coated glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with 200 volumes of wash buffer (above), bound proteins eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and enhanced for fluorography using Amplify. Recombinant Protein Expression and Affinity Purification—Vectors for expression of GST fusion proteins were transformed into BL21(DE3), cultured in Luria Broth (LB) or Terrific Broth (TB), and expressed by induction at OD = 0.6 with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 18 °C. Cells were resuspended in binding buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mm MgSO4, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 150 mm sucrose) and lysed in a French Press. Fusion proteins were bound to gluthathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h.

Cells were resuspended in one of three binding buffers designed specifically for septin purifications. Septin complexes were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mm MgSO4, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 150 mm sucrose. His-S-Sept6 was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes pH 7.5 and 600 mm NaCl. His-S-Sept7 was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5 and 300 mm MgSO4. His-S-Sept2 was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5 and 150 mm NaCl or 150 mm MgSO4. Subsequently, cells were lysed in a French Press, and affinity-purified on a HisTrap affinity column (GE Biosciences) installed on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (FPLC). Proteins were eluted in the presence of an imidazole gradient and stored in elution buffer. Size Exclusion Chromatography and Estimation of Stokes Radius (Rh)—Size exclusion chromatography was carried out at 4 °C on either a Tricorn Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Biosciences) or a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade (GE Biosciences) installed on an FPLC. Both columns were calibrated using both high and low molecular weight calibration kits (GE Biosciences) according to manufacturer's specifications. A standard calibration plot of (–log[Kav])1/2 versus Rh where Kav = (Ve – Vo)/(Vt – Vo) was used to estimate hydrodynamic radius. The following values were used to calculate Kav: column void volume, Vo = 45 ml, and total bed volume, Vt = 120 ml. Eluted fractions were subsequently analyzed for septins by standard SDS-PAGE, with gels either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or probed by Western blot. Intensities of bands were compared using the ImageJ v.1.34s software package (NIH). Molar Mass Determination—Experiments were carried out at the Macromolecular Interactions Facility (MacInFac) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, under the guidance of Dr. Ashutosh Tripathy. Fast protein liquid size exclusion chromatography was performed at room temperature on a Tricorn Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Biosciences) in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mm MgSO4, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4. The elution profiles were monitored by a Dawn EOS multiangle laser light scattering system (Wyatt Technologies) at 690 nm, and an Optilab DSP Interferometric Refractometer (Wyatt Technologies). Data acquisition and processing were carried out using ASTRA software (Wyatt Technologies). Calculation of the Perrin Factor (F)—The frictional ratio (f/f0) was calculated using Equation 1, f/f0=Rh/(3νMw/4θNA)1/3(Eq.1) which compares an ideal sphere in its hydrated versus anhydrous state. Rh is the observed hydrodynamic radius (in units of cm), ν is the partial specific volume (0.73 ml/g was assumed), Mw is the molecular weight predicted by protein sequence, and NA is Avogadro's number, 6.02 × 1023. The partial specific volume for most proteins is between 0.69 and 0.75 ml/g; the average of 0.73 ml/g was assumed. The resulting values of f/f0 were then used to calculate the Perrin factor (F) using Equation 2, F=f/f0(1+Δ/ρν)-1/3(Eq.2) where δ is the protein hydration (0.35 ml/g was assumed), ρ is the solvent density (1.0 was assumed), and ν is the partial specific volume mentioned previously. Hydration values of 0.3 to 0.4 ml/g account for the hydrodynamic behavior of typical proteins; the average of 0.35 ml/g was assumed for these calculations. Mammalian Sept6 and Sept7 Interact through a Parallel Coiled-coil—Previously, it has been shown that a C-terminal fragment is sufficient for the heterodimerization of Sept6 and Sept7 (16Sheffield P.J. Oliver C.J. Kremer B.E. Sheng S. Shao Z. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3483-3488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The COILS algorithm (28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) predicts that the C-terminal regions of Sept6 and Sept7 each contain coiled-coil regions that extend for about 100 amino acid residues. However, the relative orientation of these coiled-coils was not established. Therefore, we decided to use Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to gain further insights into the assembly of Sept6 and Sept7, and ultimately, of septin filaments. We used CFP and YFP as the donor and acceptor fluorophores, respectively. The emission spectrum of CFP overlaps with the excitation spectrum of YFP to provide efficient FRET when the two proteins are close together and are randomly oriented with respect to one another (29Tsien R.Y. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of Sept6, encompassing residues 283–429, was N-terminally tagged with YFP, and called YFP-Sept6cc, or C-terminally tagged and called Sept6cc-YFP. Sept7-(277–418), was tagged in a similar way with CFP to produce CFP-Sept7cc and Sept7cc-CFP. Initially, the ability of these fluorophore fusion proteins to form complexes was tested in vitro. Myc-tagged C-terminal fragments of the septins were 35S-labeled and expressed together with the YFP or CFP fusions in wheat germ lysate. Plants do not possess septin genes, so this lysate lacks endogenous septins that might otherwise aid in the interaction of exogenously introduced constructs. When co-expressed as a pair with its Myc-tagged binding partner, YFP-Sept6cc and CFP-Sept7cc were co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-Sept7cc and Myc-Sept6cc, respectively, in an approximate 1:1 ratio (Fig. 1A). These results confirmed that the isolated coiled-coil regions of Sept6 and Sept7 can interact with one another. However, this type of experiment does not distinguish parallel from anti-parallel interactions of the coiled-coil dimers (Fig. 1B). Therefore, YFP and CFP pairs were co-expressed in COS-7 cells, and the soluble cell extracts tested for FRET by exciting CFP at 433 nm and monitoring the emission between 450–550 nm. All raw emission spectra were adjusted to account for varying protein expression levels. Spectra were also obtained for the YFP and CFP fusion proteins separately expressed in COS cells. The YFP spectrum was subtracted from the FRET measurement to correct for spectral overlap, and the emission of CFP fusion protein alone, excited at 433 nm, is plotted for comparison (Fig. 1C). The combinations of YFP-Sept6cc and CFP-Sept7cc, both N-terminally tagged, and Sept6cc-YFP and Sept7cc-CFP, both C-terminally tagged, resulted in efficient FRET (Fig. 1, E and F). Furthermore, the FRET signal generated by two C-terminally tagged constructs improved when using full-length septins, Sept6FL-CFP and Sept7FL-YFP (Fig. 1G). This result suggested that the two proteins formed a parallel coiled-coil. To test this conclusion, we next used a combination of YFP-Sept6cc and Sept7cc-CFP, in which the Sept6 is N-terminally tagged, and the Sept7 is C-terminally tagged. This donor-acceptor pair would be predicted to generate a FRET signal only if the coiled-coils are arranged head-to-tail. However, this pair did not yield any FRET (Fig. 1H), supporting the idea that the septin coiled-coils are parallel. To confirm protein expression, all soluble cell extracts were Western-blotted using anti-GFP (Fig. 1D). Together, these results argue strongly that Sept6cc and Sept7cc interact through a parallel coiled-coil. Mammalian Sept2 Interacts with the C-terminal Coiled-coil of Sept6—Previously it has been shown that Sept6, Sept7, and Sept2 form a ternary complex that self-assembles into filaments when the three proteins are co-expressed simultaneously in vitro (16Sheffield P.J. Oliver C.J. Kremer B.E. Sheng S. Shao Z. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3483-3488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in how Sept2 associates with the Sept6/7 heterodimer. To test whether Sept2 can bind to the coiled-coils of Sept6cc and Sept7cc, we used GST-Sept2 expressed in E. coli and YFP-Sept6cc and Myc-Sept7cc that were co-expressed in a wheat germ lysate. GST-Sept2 immobilized on beads was able to bind the Sept6/7 coiled-coils, while GST alone did not (Fig. 2A), showing that the isolated coiled-coil regions of Sept6 and Sept7 can interact directly with Sept2. However, this type of experiment does not distinguish whether Sept2 binds at the N or C terminus of the coiled-coil dimer. To address this question, N- and C-terminal-tagged YFP and CFP fusion proteins of full-length Sept2FL, Sept2cc (residues 283–362, containing the putative coiled-coil), and Sept2gtp (residues 1–283, containing the isolated GTP-binding domain) were constructed. Whereas the coiled-coils of Sept6 and Sept7 were predicted to be 100 residues long, Multicoil (30Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) and COILS (28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) predict that the coiled-coil of Sept2 includes only 50 residues. In addition, COILS assigned a high probability score to the formation of a coiled-coil, whereas Multicoil assigns the same residues a low probability score. Despite the disagreement in the probability of coiled-coil formation, we could use FRET to distinguish whether the interaction between Sept2 and the coiled-coils of Sept6 and Sept7 occurred at the N or C terminus. Initially, fluorophore fusion proteins were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and protein expression was verified by Western blot using anti-GFP (Fig. 2B). Next, full-length Sept2 fluorophore fusion proteins were co-expressed with Sept6cc or Sept7cc fluorophore fusion proteins in COS-7 cells, and the soluble cell lysates were tested for FRET. Surprisingly, the only combination that gave an efficient FRET signal was Sept2FL-CFP wtih Sept6cc-YFP, in which both constructs were C-terminally tagged with fluorophore (Fig. 2C). FRET was not detected when an N- and C-terminal combination, YFP-Sept6cc and Sept2FL-CFP, was used (Fig. 2D). We then asked whether the C-terminal region of Sept2 alone could mediate the FRET interaction. However, neither Sept2cc-CFP nor a CFP-Sept2cc could generate a FRET signal equal to that of Sept2FL-CFP and Sept6cc-YFP (Fig. 2, E and F). Similarly, the N-terminal GTP binding region of Sept2 alone, Sept2gtp-CFP, and CFP-Sept2gtp, were unable to generate any detectable FRET interaction with Sept6cc-YFP (Fig. 2, G and H). In addition, no FRET was observed between Sept2FL-YFP and Sept7cc-CFP or Sept2FL-YFP and CFP-Sept7cc, suggesting that FRET between the Sept2FL-CFP and Sept6cc-YFP combination is specific for the coiled-coil of Sept6 (Fig. 2, I and J). Furthermore, full-length Sept7FL did not yield any FRET with full-length Sept2FL (Fig. 2, K and L). Taken together, these data suggest that Sept2 does not interact directly with Sept7, and that only full-length Sept2 can interact with the coiled-coil of Sept6cc, with the interaction being mediated through the C-terminal region of the Sept6 coiled-coil. Mammalian Septin GTP Binding Domains Interact with the Coiled-coil of Sept6—Our data suggest that the C-terminal regions in mammalian Sept6, Sept7, and Sept2 play key roles in mediating their interactions. To determine whether the GTP binding domains of septins are involved in complex formation, we developed N- and C-terminal YFP and CFP-labeled Sept6gtp (residues 1–255), and Sept7gtp (residues 1–272) constructs containing the GTP binding domain. These fusion proteins were individually transfected into COS-7 cells, and protein expression was verified by Western blot using anti-GFP (Fig. 3A). For FRET analysis, YFP and CFP constructs were co-transfected into COS-7 cells, and soluble cell lysates were produced. Interestingly, five positive pairings all implicated interactions between the coiled-coil of Sept6 and the GTP-binding domains of both Sept6 and Sept7 (Fig. 3, B–F). The remaining forty-nine of the fifty-four tested pairings resulted in no FRET (Tables 1 and 2), including all cases that asked whether the coiled-coil of Sept7 interacted in proximity to the GTP binding domains of Sept6 or Sept7. Compared with the rigid linearity of coiled-coils, the globular nature of GTP binding domains precludes conclusions about its orientation in these complexes. However, the proximity of the GTP binding domains to the Sept6 coiled-coil implies that the coiled-coil domain of Sept6 is a key element in septin filament polymerization.TABLE 1Summary of tested FRET combinations Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Summary of tested FRET combinations Open table in a new tab Recombinant Septins Expressed Individually in E. coli Are Asymmetric Monomers and Dimers—Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to gain insights into septin filament assembly. Previously, it has been shown that when Sept2, Sept6, and Sept7 are co-expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified on a nickel affinity column, filaments can be visualized by electron microscopy using negative stain (16Sheffield P.J. Oliver C.J. Kremer B.E. Sheng S. Shao Z. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3483-3488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The same preparation of septins analyzed by electron microscopy was also analyzed by SEC. The septin trimer eluted from a Superose 6 column between 10–15 ml, which was determined by SDS-PAGE staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 4A). This elution volume corresponds to a mean hydrodynamic radius much larger than that expected for a trimer or hexamer. Endogenous septins in HeLa cell lysates showed similar elution behavior on a Superose 6 column, eluting between 9 and 13 ml, as detected by Western blot (Fig. 4B). An overlay of the elution profiles for endogenous and in vitro purified septins suggest that they polymerize into multimeric complexes with similar hydrodynamic radii (Fig. 4C). To address whether polymerization is a property unique to the Sept2+Sept6+Sept7 complex, the hydrodynamic radii of individually expressed septins were determined. His-S-Sept2, His-S-Sept7, and His-S-Sept6 were expressed individually in E. coli, and purified on nickel affinity columns in the presence of an imidazole gradient. The fractions containing the highest concentrations of protein were further analyzed by SEC on a Superdex 200. The absorbance at 280 nm and intensity of bands resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel of individual septins are plotted on the same graph for clarity (Fig. 5, A–C). Below each graph, SDS-PAGE gels represent total protein content in each fraction at the indicated elution volume. The expected hydrodynamic radius of a globular protein with a molecular mass of 50 kDa is 3.2 nm. However, the hydrodynamic radii (Rh) calculated from the peak elution volumes for His-S-Sept6, His-S-Sept7, and His-S-Sept2 correspond to 5.0 ± 0.1, 5.65 ± 0.15, and 3.65 ± 0.09 nm, respectively (Table 3). SEC cannot distinguish whether the larger measured hydrodynamic radii of the individually expressed septins are caused by elongated protein shape or oligomerization state. Thus, the absolute molar mass was determined on a size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering instrument (SEC-MALS) using a Superose 6 column. His-S-Sept7 behaved as a mixture of monomer and dimer, with ∼4-fold more dimer present than monomer (Fig. 5D). Presumably, dimer formation is highly favorable because of the presence of the C-terminal coiled-coil, which would normally interact with the coiled-coil of Sept6. His-S-Sept2 also behaved as a heterogeneic mixture, but with predominantly monomeric composition (Fig. 5E). The concentration of His-S-Sept6 was insufficient to gather highly reliable light scattering data. However, analysis suggested that it may form a dimer similar to His-S-Sept7.TABLE 3Measured and calculated quantities used to estimate the Perrin factorRhMwf/f0FnmSept6 (dimer)5.0 ± 0.197,7441.64 ± 0.031.44 ± 0.03Sept7 (dimer)5.65 ± 0.1597,3161.85 ± 0.051.63 ± 0.05Sept2 (monomer)3.65 ± 0.0941,5261.59 ± 0.041.40 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab Using the observations made from SEC and SEC-MALS, the frictional coefficient (f/f0) and Perrin factor (F) were calculated to estimate the extent to which His-S-Sept2, His-S-Sept6, and His-S-Sept7 deviate from perfect spheres (Table 3). A sphere would have f/f0 = 1.2 and F = 1. Using the estimated hydrodynamic radii from gel filtration and molar masses calculated from SEC-MALS, f/f0 values for His-S-Sept6, His-S-Sept7, and His-S-Sept2 were 1.64 ± 0.03, 1.85 ± 0.05, and 1.59 ± 0.04, respectively. These values give Perrin factors of 1.44 ± 0.03, 1.63 ± 0.05, and 1.40 ± 0.04, respectively, which correspond to axial ratios of 6–10 for prolate ellipsoids (31Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1980: 549-586Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that septins expressed individually behave as highly asymmetric proteins in solution, and that Sept7 can self-dimerize in the absence of its usual partner, Sept6. As functional roles for septins continue to be uncovered, septin filament structure will be key to understanding and unifying how they coordinate a myriad of processes. In this study, we examine the conformation of the Sept2/6/7 complex to gather insight on filament polymerization. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the FRET experiments that suggest a model of a core subunit that could polymerize into filaments (Fig. 6B). They also show that the majority of the tested FRET pairs do not give a positive FRET signal, indicating that positive signals are not the result of nonspecific fluorophore aggregation. In Fig. 6, we propose model representations of individual and complexed septins. X-ray crystallographic structures obtained from other coiled-coil proteins help to predict the length of Sept6, Sept7, and Sept2. Assuming a 100 amino acid coiled-coil and a length of 0.15 nm/amino acid for coiled-coil structures (32O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), the coiled-coils of Sept6 and Sept7 are expected to extend ∼15 nm. Sept2 has a predicted coiled-coil of ∼50 amino acids, resulting in an estimated length of 7.5 nm. Furthermore, based on crystallographic data, typical small GTP-binding proteins have a diameter of 4 nm (33Stewart M. Kent H.M. McCoy A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Wittinghofer F. Krengel U. John J. Kabsch W. Pai E.F. Environ. Health Perspect. 1991; 93: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we model Sept6, Sept7, and Sept2 as rod-like asymmetric proteins with lengths of 11.5–19 nm and maximum diameters of 4 nm (Fig. 6A). This representation is supported by our hydrodynamic and molecular mass data; the calculated Perrin factors indicate a high ratio (6Hanai N. Nagata K. Kawajiri A. Shiromizu T. Saitoh N. Hasegawa Y.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) between the long and short axes of the molecules, which would match well with the mean lengths and diameters we expect from structural considerations. Complexed septins maintain their extended conformations while interacting with one another. Our FRET data suggest that the core subunit of the Sept2/6/7 complex consists of a parallel coiled-coil interaction between Sept6cc and Sept7cc (Fig. 6B). The C terminus of full-length Sept2 specifically interacts with the C terminus of Sept6cc. One model of the Sept2/6/7 complex consisting of all three full-length proteins is also presented, but since the globular GTP binding domains have rotational freedom with respect to each other, the exact conformation cannot be deduced using this type of experiment. Similarly, FRET analysis summarized in Tables 1 and 2 suggest close interactions between the coiled-coil of Sept6 and the GTP binding domains of Sept6 and Sept7, however, we cannot distinguish whether their proximity arises within one subunit or as a consequence of multiple subunit oligomerization. The frequency with which FRET was observed using Sept6cc leads us to speculate that the coiled-coil domains could play a critical role in the polymerization of septin filaments. Previously, others have shown that septins may interact through their C-terminal coiled-coils. In budding yeast, Cdc3 and Cdc12 associate through the CTE, or C-terminal extension, which includes the coiled-coiled regions. This association is essential for their function in vivo (23Versele M. Gullbrand B. Shulewitz M.J. Cid V.J. Bahmanyar S. Chen R.E. Barth P. Alber T. Thorner J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4568-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of the Sept7/9b/11 complex reveals that Sept7 and Sept11 also interact through their C-terminal coiled-coil domains (15Nagata K. Asano T. Nozawa Y. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55895-55904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the relative orientations of the components of these complexes were not determined. Based on our observations, we could assemble two models for filament polymerization by varying the orientation of the core subunit. Both polar and non-polar filaments can be constructed (Fig. 6C). The polar filament consists of hexamers of two heterotrimers rotated 180° along the vertical axis with respect to each other. A non-polar filament can be modeled by hexamers of two heterotrimers reflected over the horizontal axis. Future work will attempt to differentiate and identify which model most closely resembles septin filaments. A long-term goal is to obtain three-dimensional structures of a septin core subunit. However, much biochemical work remains to fully characterize the relationship and significance between structure and function.

The enzyme is localized to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum where it negatively regulates insulin signaling by dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) residues in the kinase regulatory domain of the insulin receptor (IR) (1Frangioni J.V.

Similar results were also observed when an antisense oligonucleotide was injected into mice (5Zinker B.A. Rondinone C.M. Trevillyan J.M. Gum R.J. Clampit J.E. Waring J.F. Xie N. Wilcox D. Jacobson P.

These compelling biological results coupled with the wealth of structural data, which have been generated since the crystal structure of PTP1B was determined in 1994 (6Barford D. Flint A.J.

Unfortunately, poor physicochemical properties have limited their development as drug candidates. Crystal structures of PTP1B in complex with phosphorylated peptides corresponding to the IR kinase activation segment (14Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and an autophosphorylated site of the epidermal growth factor receptor (15Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) reveal that the highly negatively charged substrates bind to multiple positively charged sites (Fig. 1a). The catalytic site, which is located at the base of a shallow pocket called the primary phosphate-binding pocket or A site, is the most polar region of the protein, and it contains the phosphate-binding signature motif (Cys215-Arg221) common to all members of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family (16Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Møller N.P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). A second phosphate-binding pocket (B site), adjacent to the A site, was identified from the crystal structures of the protein in complex with a small aryl phosphonate (17Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S. Zhang Z.-Y. Prot. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13420-13425Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and a bisphosphorylated peptide (14Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The B site, which is larger and shallower than the A site and has lower binding affinity for aryl phosphates, is noncatalytic but may play an important role in determining substrate specificity. A third phosphate-binding site (C site) was identified when the distal Tyr(P) mimetic of a bisphosphonate-containing inhibitor unexpectedly bound in a large flat region of the protein near Lys41 and Arg47 (18Jia Z. Ye Q. Dinaut A.N. Wang Q. Waddleton D. Payette P. Ramachandran C. Kennedy B. Hum G. Taylor S.D. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 4584-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Overall, the active site of PTP1B possesses very few desirable drug-design features. The highly charged A site and flat, solvent-exposed B and C sites significantly increase the difficulty of designing potent inhibitors with acceptable membrane permeability. In the past 10 years, many anions that mimic the interactions of phosphate, in the A site, have been incorporated into the design process (19Burke Jr., T.R. Lee K. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The most potent include the following: oxalylaminothiophene carboxylic acid (OTCA), carboxymethoxybenzoic acid (CMBA), oxalylaminobenzoic acid, and difluoromethylphosphonic acid (DFMP) (Fig. 1b). Unfortunately, the resulting compounds have poor membrane permeability because their highly charged phosphonate mimetics are ionized at physiological pH. We have recently reported the design of a novel five-membered isothiazolidinone (IZD) heterocyclic phosphonate mimetic that possesses only a single delocalized negative charge (Fig. 1b) (20Combs A.P. Yue E.W. Bower M. Ala P.J. Wayland B. Douty B. Takvorian A. Polam P. Wasserman Z. Zhu W. Crawley M. Pruitt J. Sparks R. Glass B. Modi D. McLaughlin E. Bostrom L. Li M. Galya L. Blom K. Hillman M. Gonneville L. Reid B. Wei M. Becker-Pasha M. Klabe R. Huber R. Li Y. Hollis G. Burn T.C. Wynn R. Liu P. Metcalf B. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 6544-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). IZD-containing compounds are potent competitive inhibitors of PTP1B, but more importantly, they have been shown recently to have cellular activity in an IR phosphorylation assay (21Combs A.P. Zhu W. Crawley M.L. Glass B. Polam P. Sparks R.B. Modi D. Takvorian A. McLaughlin E. Yue E.W. Wasserman Z. Bower M. Wei M. Rupar M. Ala P.J. Reid B.M. Ellis D. Gonneville L. Emm T. Taylor N. Yeleswaram S. Li Y. Wynn R. Burn T.C. Hollis G. Liu P.C.C. Metcalf B. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 3774-37789Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The IZD ring was specifically designed to incorporate all previously observed binding features of known phosphonate mimetics. For example, it simultaneously mimics the interactions of the three phosphate oxygens of DFMP, which is arguably the most potent phosphonate mimetic, and the carboxymethyl group of CMBA (Fig. 2a). Combining these features into a single heterocycle has produced one of the most potent phosphonate mimetics reported to date. One of our most potent IZD-containing peptides (compound 8) has an IC50 value of 190 nm, which is ∼9-fold more potent than the equivalent DFMP-containing analog (Table 3). In order to gain insights into the structural basis for inhibition of PTP1B by IZD-containing compounds, we have solved the crystal structures of the protein in complex with IZD-phenol and several IZD-containing peptides (Table 2). Identifying the key binding interactions should aid the design of small molecule inhibitors as well as the design of even more potent, less polar phosphate mimetics.TABLE 3Phosphonate mimetic SAR Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Data collection and refinement statistics for PTP1B in complex with phosphonate mimetics Open table in a new tab Two constructs of the catalytic domain of human PTP1B (435 amino acids), 1-321 and PTP1B-(1-His6-298), were expressed in Escherichia coli essentially as described previously (22Barford D.

Briefly, BL21(DE3)-competent cells (Novagen) were transformed with the expression plasmids as described by the manufacturer. LB broth (2 ml) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with a single colony from an ampicillin-containing LB agar plate and incubated in a 15-ml tube for 2 h of shaking at 225 rpm at 37 °C. The culture was then used to inoculate 50 ml of Terrific Broth (Media Tech) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in a 500-ml vented Erlenmeyer flask. The following day, the 50-ml culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of Terrific Broth/ampicillin in a 3-liter vented Fernbach culture flask. When the A600 reached 1, 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and the culture was incubated for 16 h of shaking at 75 rpm at 27 °C. The culture was pelleted at 5,800 × g, immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C. Cell paste was suspended (5 ml/g of cells) at 4 °C in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)) and stirred for 15 min. The mixture was then homogenized for 30 s using an Ultra-Turrax T 25 basic (IKA Works, Inc.), lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer (Avestin, Inc.) with two passes at 10,000-15,000 p.s.i., and then centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant containing soluble PTP1B-(1-His6-298) was mixed with Talon metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences) at a protein to resin ratio of 10:1 (mg/ml) and stirred for 2 h. The protein/resin mixture was then poured into a column and washed with buffer A until the eluate A280 < 0.1. The resin was then washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. The supernatant containing soluble PTP1B-(1-321) was mixed with Q-Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare) and placed in a spinner flask overnight at 4 °C. The protein/resin mixture was then filtered through a sintered glass filter, resuspended in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA), poured into a column, and washed until A280 < 0.1. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-500 mm) in buffer B using a total of 10 column volumes. Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing PTP1B were pooled and mixed with diammonium sulfate (4 m stock) to a final concentration of 1.7 m. The mixture was then diluted with an equal volume of buffer B containing 1.7 m diammonium sulfate and loaded onto a fast flow phenyl-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted with a decreasing diammonium sulfate gradient (1.7-0 m) using 8 column volumes. Column fractions from both preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing PTP1B were concentrated to 5 mg/ml using a stirred cell with a YM-10 membrane (Millipore). The concentrated protein (2-ml aliquots) was injected onto a HiLoad Superdex 75 26/60 Prep Grade column connected to an ÁKTApurifier chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was pre-equilibrated with buffer C (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and run at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Fractions containing pure protein were concentrated to 10 mg/ml and stored in 200-μl aliquots at -20 °C. Approximately 20 mg of pure PTP1B was obtained from 12 g of cells. PTP1B enzymatic assays were performed essentially as described previously (23Szczepankiewicz B.G. Liu G. Hajduk P.J. Abad-Zapatero C. Pei Z. Xin Z. Lubben T.H. Trevillyan J.M. Stashko M.A. Ballaron S.J. Liang H. Huang F. Hutchins C.W. Fesik S.W. Jirousek M.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 4087-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein activity was determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The reaction was performed at room temperature in 25 mm Tris-bis-propane, pH 7.0, containing 5 nm PTP1B, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, which is its Km value. IC50 values were determined by fitting the initial rates of p-nitrophenol production to a sigmoidal dose-response equation using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software). The two protein constructs, PTP1B-(1-321) and PTP1B-(1-His6-298), were crystallized in the presence and absence of inhibitors (dissolved in water pH 7.0). All crystals were grown using the vapor diffusion method with or without microseeding in 24- or 96-well plates in which the protein drops were equilibrated against 1 or 0.15 ml of well solution, respectively, at 4 or 10 °C. Crystals of PTP1B-(1-321)—The apoprotein crystallized in the trigonal space group P3121 as hexagonal rods (0.3 × 0.2 × 0.01 mm) 7 days after mixing 2 μl of protein (10 mg/ml) with 2 μl of well solution (100 mm Hepes, pH 6.6, 14-16% PEG 8000, and 200 mm magnesium acetate) at 4 °C. Crystals of PTP1B in complex with compounds 1, 2, and 3 were grown by mixing 2 μl of protein/inhibitor solution (10 mg/ml protein with 3, 10, and 2.4 mm inhibitor, respectively) with 2 μl of well solution (100 mm Hepes, pH 6.6, 14-16% PEG 8000, and 200 mm magnesium acetate). Hexagonal rods containing compounds 1 (0.06 × 0.06 × 0.12 mm), 2 (0.02 × 0.02 × 0.25 mm), and 3 (0.02 × 0.02 × 0.25 mm) appeared 7-10 days after macroseeding at 4 °C. Crystals of PTP1B 1-[His6]-298—The apoprotein crystallized in the orthorhombic P212121 and monoclinic C2 space groups. The orthorhombic crystals grew into thin plates (0.3 × 0.2 × 0.01 mm) 7 days after mixing 1 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml protein, 0.025% β-octyl glucoside, and 2 mm TCEP) with 1 μl of well solution (100 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 5.9, and 25-35% methylpentanediol) at 4 °C. The monoclinic crystals grew into large bipyramids (0.2 mm in length) 3-5 days after mixing 2 μl of protein (10 mg/ml) with 2 μl of well solution (12-16% PEG 3000, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.0-8.0, 200 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mm TCEP) and microseeding at 4 °C. Rod-shaped crystals of PTP1B/4 (0.04 × 0.04 × 0.25 mm) appeared 7-10 days after mixing 4 μl of protein/inhibitor solution (10 mg/ml protein, 0.025% β-octyl glucoside, 2 mm TCEP, and 2 mm compound) with 4 μl of well solution (100 mm Hepes, pH 8.5, and 1.12 m sodium citrate) and microseeding at 10 °C. Rod-shaped crystals of PTP1B/5 (0.05 × 0.05 × 0.3 mm) appeared 10 days after mixing 2 μl of protein/inhibitor solution (10 mg/ml protein, 0.025% β-octyl glucoside, 2 mm TCEP, and 2.4 mm compound) with 2 μl of well solution (100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 1.4-1.8 m ammonium sulfate) at 4 °C. Crystals were transferred stepwise at 1-min intervals into cryoprotectant solutions of mother liquor containing 10 and 20% glycerol and then flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream at -180 °C. For PTP1B/1 crystals, additional compound (10 mm) was added to the cryoprotectant solution to prevent the inhibitor from soaking out during the procedure. The orthorhombic apocrystals were cooled in mother liquor without additional cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were collected with one crystal per data set on a Rigaku/MSC RAXIS IV++ imaging system mounted on a Rigaku/MSC MicroMax™-007 rotating anode microfocus generator (CuKα) operating at 40 kV and 20 mA and equipped with a 0.3-mm cathode, 0.5- and 0.03-mm double collimator, and a Blue Confocal Max-Flux® optical system. Diffraction intensities were integrated and scaled using Crystal-Clear (Rigaku/MSC). The orthorhombic and monoclinic apostructures and the structures containing 2 and 4 were solved by molecular replacement using the protein coordinates from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (24Berman H.M.

All rotation and translation searches yielded single consistent solutions for data between 15 and 4 Å. The resulting models were subjected to rigid body refinement followed by simulated annealing (using torsion angle dynamics) and positional and temperature factor refinements using CNX. All other structures were solved by difference Fourier methods using the relevant starting model. The conformations of the bound inhibitors were unambiguously determined after one or two cycles of refinement. The final models were generated after several cycles of model building and refinement using QUANTA (Accelrys) and CNX, respectively. Only the (S)-IZD stereoisomers of 2 and 3 were observed in the crystal structures even though diastereoisomeric mixtures were used in crystallization experiments. Solvent molecules were added by visual inspection of electron density maps using X-SOLVATE (Accelrys). The final models are consistent with simulated annealed omit maps: 1 (Fig. 2b), apo P212121 (Fig. 3a), 4 (Fig. 7a), and 2 (Fig. 8b). Crystallographic data and refinement statistics are listed in Tables 1 and 2.FIGURE 7Crystal structure of PTP1B/4. a, stereo view of the 2Fo - Fc simulated annealed omit map (contoured at 1σ) and atomic model for PTP1B/4.

Note only the (S)-IZD isomer of 2 crystallized in complex with PTP1B, even though a diastereoisomeric mixture was present during crystallization. c, superposition of PTP1B/2 (surface and thick and thin bonds) and 5 (ball-and-stick) reveals that IZD and DFMP project the peptide scaffold in exactly the same position in the C site. Note Wat4 hydrogen bonds to DFMP, and a sulfate ion in the B site hydrogen bonds to Arg24 and Arg254 in PTP1B/5; the protein of the latter was omitted for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for apoPTP1BProtein constructPTP1B 1-(His6)-298PTP1B 1-321Data collection statisticsTemperature (°C)−1804−180−180Space groupP212121P212121C2P3121Unit cell (Å, °)a = 40.6a = 41.1a = 106.8a = b = 88.3b = 69.2b = 70.4b = 95.5c = 104.1c = 100.8c = 102.4c = 70.7β = 109.7Resolution range (Å)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution bin.33-1.5 (1.55-1.5)19-2.0 (2.07-2.0)27-2.1 (2.18-2.1)44-2.1 (2.18-2.1)Molecules/absorbance unit1121No. of unique reflections44,32718,00338,99127,186Average redundancy4.0 (2.3)2.5 (2.4)3.7 (3.7)5.0 (5.0)Completeness (%)95.7 (73.0)86.9 (89.6)99.8 (100)97.4 (95.3)〈I/σ 〉bAverage of the diffraction intensities divided by their standard deviations.16.5 (3.0)5.1 (1.8)14.8 (5.6)17.6 (4.6)Rmerge (%)cRmerge = ∑hkl∑i|Ihkl,i - 〈Ihkl 〉|/∑hkl∑i(Ihkl,i), where 〈Ihkl 〉 is the average intensity of the multiple Ihkl,i observations.4.9 (32.4)10.3 (41.1)5.8 (13.7)5.2 (31.0)Refinement statisticsNo. of protein atoms2341227244742410No. of solvent atoms341127507207No. of heteroatoms16027Rmsd, bond (Å/°)0.011/1.540.008/1.400.008/1.40.011/1.54Resolution range (Å)33-1.519-2.027-2.144-2.1Rfactor/Rfree (%)dRfactor = ∑hkl||Fo| - |Fc||/∑hkl|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes for reflection hkl, respectively.

Open table in a new tab To identify the unique structural features responsible for the high potency of IZD-containing compounds, we have determined the crystal structure of PTP1B in complex with the small unsaturated IZD-phenol 1, which is a potent inhibitor for its size (IC50 = 1.35 μm) (Table 2). Crystal structures of PTP1B in complex with unsaturated and saturated IZD- and DFMP-containing peptides were also determined (Table 2) to explain why the saturated IZD 8 is 9- and 16-fold more potent than the equivalent DFMP 5 and unsaturated 6 analogs (Table 3), respectively, as well as identify key interactions outside of the A site that might aid the design of non-peptidic inhibitors. IZD Is Highly Complementary to the Primary Phosphate Binding Pocket—The structure of PTP1B/1 reveals extensive interactions between the inhibitor and the A site. The heterocycle binds at the center of the phosphate-binding loop (Cys215-Arg221), where its four hydrogen bonding acceptors are in the vicinity (2.7-3.3 Å) of 10 donors (Fig. 2c). The sulfone oxygens hydrogen bond to N-η of Arg221 and the backbone nitrogens of Ser216, Ala217, Gly218, Ile219, and Gly220. The nitrogen anion interacts with the helix dipole of α4 (Arg221-Arg238) and hydrogen bonds to N-ϵ and backbone NH of Arg221, and the carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonds to the backbone nitrogen of Phe182 and side chain of Gln266. An additional hydrogen bond is observed between the side chain of Asp181 and the π electrons of the unsaturated IZD. The hydrophobic side of the heterocycle and phenyl ring directly attached to it interact with the hydrophobic half of the A site as follows: Tyr46, Val49, Ala217, Ile219, Phe182, and the aliphatic portion of the side chain of Gln262. The latter van der Waals interactions and the extensive network of hydrogen bonds are key reasons why IZD-phenol is a potent inhibitor. IZD Displaces All Tightly Bound Waters in the A Site—The recently reported high resolution crystal structure of the apoprotein in the P3121 space group revealed the presence of three water molecules that bind in the same locations as the phosphonate oxygens of Tyr(P)-containing substrates (25Pedersen A.K. Peters G.H. Møller K.B. Iversen L.F. Kastrup J.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1527-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To confirm that the observed water structure is independent of crystallization conditions and space group, we solved the structures of the apoprotein in two additional space groups, P212121 (Fig. 3a) and C2, as well as the reported P3121. Four tightly bound water molecules (Wat1-4) are observed in each structure, except the C2 structure that does not contain Wat4 (Fig. 3b). Three of the waters hydrogen bond to backbone nitrogens of the phosphate-binding loop: Wat1 hydrogen bonds to Arg221, Wat2 to Ile219 and Gly220, and Wat3 to Ser216 and Ala217. The fourth water hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Gln266. Other waters in the A site are not conserved between the structures and thus probably interact weakly with the protein. The second aryl phosphate-binding site (B site) is also highly solvated: five conserved waters are located near Arg254. The most tightly bound water, based on electron density, is Wat5, which hydrogen bonds directly to the side chain Arg254 and appears to organize the surrounding water. Importantly, the presence of Wat2, Wat3, and most of the conserved B site waters does not appear to be an artifact of the low temperature data collection, because they are also present in the P212121 apostructure solved at 4 °C. Finally, our trigonal structure is identical to the reported structure, containing a glycerol in the hydrophobic half of the A site and a mixture of opened and closed conformations of the flap (Phe180-Ile184). The disordered conformation of the flap and the presence of glycerol, however, do not appear to influence the water structure associated with the phosphate-binding loop because the waters are also present in our P212121 and C2 apostructures that only contain the opened conformation of the flap. A superposition of apoPTP1B (P212121) and PTP1B in complex with the unsaturated IZD 4 (Table 2; our highest resolution structure) reveals that the IZD-phenyl moiety displaces at least nine waters, more then any other Tyr(P) mimetic (Fig. 4). The sulfone oxygens and nitrogen anion displace Wat1-Wat3; the carbonyl oxygen and phenyl each displace two waters, and the side chain of Arg221 which shifts as a result of ligand binding displaces two waters. The three phosphate oxygens of the DFMP moiety of 5 displace Wat1-Wat3 but not Wat4, which shifts by 1.5 Å to accommodate one of the fluorine atoms and remains trapped under the flap where it hydrogen bonds to the fluorine atoms of DFMP, the backbone NH of Phe182, and side chain of Gln266. The CMBA moiety of the PDB entry code 1G7G only displaces Wat1 and Wat4, and the OTCA of 1C83 displaces Wat1-Wat3 but traps Wat4. So far IZD and the recently reported thiadiazolidinone (26Black E. Breed J. Breeze A.L. Embrey K. Garcia R. Gero T.W. Godfrey L. Kenny P.W. Morley A.D. Minshull C.A. Pannifer A.D. Read J. Rees A. Russell D.J. Toader D. Tucker J. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Using 5 days of time on the Hubble Space Telescope, we have constructed an ultradeep color-magnitude diagram for this cluster. We see a clear truncation in each of its two major stellar sequences. Faint red main-sequence stars run out well above our observational limit and near to the theoretical prediction for the lowest mass stars capable of stable hydrogen burning in their cores. We also see a truncation in the number counts of faint blue stars, namely white dwarfs. This reflects the limit to which the bulk of the white dwarfs can cool over the lifetime of the cluster. There is also a turn toward bluer colors in the least luminous of these objects. This was predicted for the very coolest white dwarfs with hydrogen-rich atmospheres as the formation of H 2 and the resultant collision-induced absorption cause their atmospheres to become largely opaque to infrared radiation."

We have cloned the mouse orthologue of human ODCp and studied its expression and possible function. mRNA of mouse Odcp was found in the brain and testes, showing a conserved expression pattern with regard to the human gene. Transfection of mouse Odcp in HEK 293T cells elicited an increase in ODC activity, but no signs of arginine decarboxylase activity were evident. On the other hand, whereas the ODCp protein was mainly localized in the mitochondrial/membrane fraction, ODC activity was found in the cytosolic fraction and was markedly decreased by small interfering RNA against human ODC. Co-transfection experiments with combinations of Odc, Az1, Az2, Az3, antizyme inhibitor (Azi), and Odcp genes showed that ODCp mimics the action of AZI, rescuing ODC from the effects of AZs and prevented ODC degradation by the proteasome. A direct interaction between ODCp and AZs was detected by immunoprecipitation experiments.

AZ1, the first described member of the family, binds to ODC monomers preventing the formation of active ODC homodimers and promoting the degradation of ODC through the 26 S proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner (19Murakami Y.

This protein, having a sequence highly similar to that of ODC, is devoid of ornithine decarboxylating activity; however, it can activate ODC by competing for AZ, because AZI binds to AZ with high affinity preventing or decreasing the formation of the ODC-AZ complex (24Murakami Y.

Heiskala M. Andersson L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the facts that in vitro translated human ODCp did not decarboxylate l-ornithine (52Pitkanen L.T. Heiskala M. Andersson L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and that Escherichia coli extracts expressing recombinant human ODCp lacked ODC or ADC activity (48Coleman C.S. Hu G.R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 849-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) raise doubts on its possible ADC activity, leaving unsettled the function of human ODCp. In our previous studies, in spite of the fact that we did not find agmatine synthesis in mouse extracts using HPLC and electro-phoretic techniques, we could not rule out the possibility that a minor part of the 14CO2 released from mouse tissue extracts incubated with 14C-labeled arginine could be the result of the existence of ADC in mammalian cells (46Penafiel R. Ruzafa C. Pedreño E. Cremades A. Bardocz S. White A. Hajos G Metabolic Effects of Biologically Active Amines in Food. European Commission, Luxembourg1998: 79-85Google Scholar, 47Ruzafa C. Monserrat F. Cremades A. Penafiel R. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2003; 14: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this work, we have taken advantage of the published sequence of the murine orthologue gene of human ODCp to study its expression in mouse tissues. We cloned and sequenced this gene and studied the activity of its product by means of transient transfection experiments of human HEK 293T cells. The results obtained support the view that the product of the murine Odcp gene acts as an antizyme inhibitor protein that is devoid of substantial intrinsic ODC or ADC activity. l-[1-14C]Ornithine was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals Inc. (Brea, CA). l-[U-14C]arginine (specific activity from different lots ranged from 240-320 mCi/mmol) was supplied by American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, Taq DNA polymerase, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody peroxidase conjugate, anti-HA monoclonal antibody peroxidase conjugate, anti-HA affinity gel beads, protease inhibitor mixture (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, EDTA, bestatin, E-64, leupeptin, aprotinin), Igepal CA-630, and E. coli ADC were purchased from Sigma. Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Biotools (Madrid, Spain). Restriction endo-nucleases EcoRI, XbaI, and BamHI were from Fermentas Life Sciences (Vilnius, Lithuania). Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). 2-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) was obtained from Ilex Products Inc. (San Antonio, TX). 2-Difluoromethylarginine was a gift from Merrell-Dow Pharmaceuticals. Total RNA was extracted from tissues with GenElute mammalian total RNA Miniprep kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)18 as primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Products were amplified by means of Taq polymerase using specific primer pairs within the linear range for each gene product. Amplified products were resolved by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel containing 40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) in a horizontal slab gel apparatus using the same Tris acetate/EDTA buffer. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.2 μg/ml for 15 min) and photographed by UV transillumination using a Gel Doc system camera (Bio-Rad). The bands were quantified using the Multi-Analyst PC software from Bio-Rad. Primers (Sigma Genosys) were as follows: mouse β-actin (forward, 5′-TGCGTCTGGACCTGGCTG; reverse, 5′-CTGCTGGAAGGTGGACAG); mouse ODC (forward, 5′-TGGAGTGAGAATCATAGCTG; reverse, 5′-TTGGCCTCTGGAACCCATTG); mouse ODCp (forward, 5′-GTGAATCGGACTTTGTGATGGT; reverse, 5′-GGGTAGCAATGCACAGAACC); mouse AZ1 (forward, 5′-ACGCAGCGCCACGCTTCACGC; reverse, 5′-TTCGGAGTAGGGCGGCTCTGT); mouse AZ2 (forward, 5′-AAGTGTCCCCAGCTCCAGTGCT; reverse, 5′-CGAGTCAACTCCGAGAACACAATG); mouse AZ3 (forward, 5′-TCCAGTGCTCCTGAGTCCCTA; reverse, 5′-CACATACTCCAGTGTTGCTG). Total RNA was extracted from brain and testis of Swiss CD1 adult mice, and cDNA was obtained as described above. The complete mouse ODCp coding sequence was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase with the forward primer 5′-CTGGAATTCATGGCTGGCTATCTGAGTG and the reverse primer 5′-ACATCTAGACTCACATGATGCTTGCTGG derived from the mouse ODCp cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_172875). Thirty PCR rounds (denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 2 min at 64 °C, and extension for 2 min at 72 °C, followed by a final 10-min extension at 72 °C) were performed using brain cDNA as template, 5 μm of each primer, 200 μm of each dNTP, and 1.5 units of the proofreading Pfu polymerase. The amplification product was purified, digested, and inserted in the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by the added restriction sites (underlined) and used to transform competent DH5α E. coli cells following standard procedures (53Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mouse ODC, AZ1, AZ2, AZ3, and AZI coding sequences were cloned by a similar procedure using the following primers: ODC (forward, 5′-ACAGAATTCACCATGAGCAGCTTTAC; reverse 5′-AACTTCTAGACAAGAGCTACAAGAATG); AZ1 (forward, 5′-TGGGAATTCACCCCAGCGGCCGGATGG; reverse 5′-ACGTCTAGAGGACTAACCCAGGAGAGGG); AZ2 (forward, 5′-CCGGAATTCAAGTGTCCCCAGCTCC; reverse, 5′-GCTTCTAGACAAAGCATCCTCTGTGAC); AZ3 (forward, 5′-GCGGAATTCCTCTACTGTTACAAATAC; reverse 5′-TTATCTAGACTCACTGGCCAGGGTGGCC); and AZI (forward, 5′-ACGGAATTCATGAAAGGATTTATTGACGATG; reverse, 5′-ACTTCTAGACTAAGGAAGCGTTAATGCC). The identity of the clones was ascertained by DNA sequencing of the cloned inserts by means of an ABI PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) at the Servicio de Apoyo a las Ciencias Experimentales facilities, University of Murcia. The pcDNA3 plasmids containing ODC, ODCp, or AZI coding sequences inserted between the restriction sites EcoRI and XbaI of the polylinker were opened by digestion with BamHI and EcoRI enzymes. The FLAG epitope DYKDDDDK was added to the N terminus of ODC by inserting a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide encoding the epitope (in boldface) and designed for annealing with the cohesive ends of the open vector (54Szymanska G. O'Connor M.B. O'Connor C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The sense 33-oligomer had the sequence 5′-GATCCATGGACTATAAGGACGATGATGACAAGG and the antisense 33-oligomer had the sequence 5′-AATTCCTTGTCATCATCGTCCTTATAGTCCATG. One nmol of each oligonucleotide was diluted in 100 μl of water, and the mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and then left for annealing at room temperature. One μl of the annealed mixture and 10 ng of the digested plasmid were ligated and used to transform competent DH5α E. coli cells following standard procedures. The sequences of the constructs were verified as described above. To express full-length functional antizymes, the anti-zyme-specific stop codon of the ribosomal frame-shifting site was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis by means of the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol and the following mutagenic primers: ΔAZ1 (forward, 5′-CGGTGGTGCTCCGATGTCCCTCACCC; reverse, 5′-GGGTGAGGGACATCGGAGCACCACCG); ΔAZ2 (forward, 5′-CCTCTGTGGTGCTCCGATGCCCCTCACC; reverse, 5′-GGTGAGGGGCATCGGAGCACCACAGAGG); and ΔAZ3 (forward, 5′-CTCCAGTGCTCCGAGTCCCTAGGAG; reverse, 5′-CTCCTAGGGACTCGGAGCACTGGAG). Deletions were introduced by incorporating the appropriate nucleotide changes into the primers. The N-terminal HA (hemagglutinin) epitope was introduced into the three antizyme clones by PCR. The sequence for the HA epitope (in boldface) was added in front of the following sense primers: HA-AZ1 (5′-CGGGAATTCATGTACCCATACGATGTCCCAGATTACGCTATGGTGAAATCCTCCCTGCAGCGG); HA-AZ2 (5′-CTGGAATTCATGTACCCATACGATGTCCCAGATTACGCTATGCCCCTCACCCACTG); and HA-AZ3 (5′-AAGGAATTCATGTACCCATACGATGTCCCAGATACGCTATGCTGCCTTGTTGTTAC). HA-tagged antizymes were cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3. The sequences of the constructs were verified as described above. Human embryonic HEK 293T cells obtained from the ATCC were cultured in RPMI 1640, containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were grown to ∼90% confluence. Transient transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent with 1.5 or 0.75 μg of pcDNA3 plasmid per well for 6- or 12-well plates, respectively. After 6 h of incubation the transfection medium was removed, and fresh complete medium was added, and cells were grown for 16 h. The cells were then collected for ODC/ADC assays, RNA isolation, and Western blot. In co-transfection experiments, 0.75 μg of DNA per well was used, with the mixtures containing equimolecular amounts of each construct. The plasmid pcDNA3 without gene insertion was used as negative control. Specific siRNAs targeting human ODC were selected using siRNA Target Finder, and the Silencer™ predesigned siRNA matching exon 4 (sense, 5′-GGAUGCCUUCUAUGUGGAtt; antisense 5′-UGCCACAUAGAAGGCAUCCtt) was obtained from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). This siRNA was used to co-transfect HEK 293T cells with pcDNA3 plasmid containing ODCp or AZI cDNA, as described above. siRNA concentration in the transfection medium ranged from 15 to 100 nm. Silencer Negative Control 1 siRNA (Ambion), having no significant similarity to any known gene sequences from mouse, rat, or human, was used as negative control. Protocol I—Except when specifically indicated, ODC activity was assayed in the soluble fraction of HEK 293T cells lysed in a media containing the detergent Igepal. In brief, after transfection the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pelleted. Then cells were resuspended and lysed in PBS containing 1% phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Igepal, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and ODC activity was determined in the supernatant. ODC activity was assayed basically as described elsewhere (55Russell D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 60: 1420-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) by measuring 14CO2 release from l-[1-14C]ornithine. The incubation mixture contained 20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4 mm l-[1-14C]ornithine (specific activity, 4.7 mCi/mmol) in a total volume of 62.5 μl. The reaction was performed in glass tubes with tightly closed rubber stopper. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 2 m citric acid. 14CO2 was trapped in two disks of filter paper wetted in 0.5 m benzethonium hydroxide dissolved in methanol. The filter paper disks were transferred to scintillation vials and counted by liquid scintillation. Activity was expressed as nanomoles of 14CO2 produced per h and per mg of protein. 1% Igepal did not significantly affect ODC activity that was inhibited more than 95% by 1 mm DFMO. Protocol II—ODC and putative ADC measurements in homogenates and fractionated extracts of HEK 293T cells were carried out as follows. Cells collected and washed in PBS were homogenized in ice-cold Tris/sucrose buffer using a Polytron homogenizer. The composition of the homogenizing buffer (buffer A) was as follows: 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm di-thiothreitol, 0.25 m sucrose, 200 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 13 μm bestatin, 1.4 μm E-64, 100 μm leupeptin, 30 nm aprotinin. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant that was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to collect a post-mitochondrial supernatant (S12) and a crude mitochondrial pellet (P12). The P12 pellet was resuspended either in buffer A (for ODC determination) or in buffer B (for ADC determination) consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 0.1 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgSO4, and protease inhibitors as in buffer A. ODC activity in the different cell fractions obtained was determined basically as described above. ADC activity was measured in buffer B containing 0.06 m sucrose and 0.25 mm l-[(U)-14C]arginine (specific activity 6.4 mCi/mmol) at 30 °C for 1 h, and 14CO2 was trapped and counted as described in the ODC assay. The protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (56Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Cells were extracted with 0.4 m perchloric acid, and the supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min was used for polyamine determination. In brief, polyamines underwent dansylation according to the method described by Seiler (57Seiler N. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 10-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the dansylated polyamines were separated by HPLC using a Lichrosorb 10-RP-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Merck) and acetonitrile/methanol/water mixtures (running from 42:28:30 to 58:38:4 ratio during 40 min of analysis) as mobile phase and at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 1,6-Hexanediamine was used as internal standard, and standard solutions of agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine were used to calibrate the column. Detection of the derivatives was achieved using a fluorescence detector, with a 340-nm excitation filter and a 435-nm emission filter. In addition, after ADC assays using l-[U-14C] arginine, the putative radioactive polyamines underwent dansylation and were separated by HPLC as described above. 1-ml fractions were collected, and aliquots were counted by liquid scintillation using Ecoscint™ H scintillation solution (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Agmatine formation was also estimated by analyzing the radioactive products formed after ADC assay by paper electrophoresis in 500 mm pyridine/acetic acid buffer (pH 6.1)"

https://openalex.org/W2034435553,"1-Cys peroxiredoxins (1-Cys Prxs) are antioxidant enzymes that catalyze the reduction of hydroperoxides into alcohols using a strictly conserved cysteine. 1-Cys B-Prxs, homologous to human PrxVI, were recently shown to be reactivated by glutathione S-transferase (GST) π via the formation of a GST-Prx heterodimer and Prx glutathionylation. In contrast, 1-Cys D-Prxs, homologous to human PrxV, are reactivated by the glutaredoxin-glutathione system through an unknown mechanism. To investigate the mechanistic events that mediate the 1-Cys D-Prx regeneration, interaction of the Prx with glutathione was studied by mass spectrometry and NMR. This work reveals that the Prx can be glutathionylated on its active site cysteine. Evidences are reported that the glutathionylation of 1-Cys D-Prx induces the dissociation of the Prx non-covalent homodimer, which can be recovered by reduction with dithiothreitol. This work demonstrates for the first time the existence of a redox-dependent dimer-monomer switch in the Prx family, similar to the decamer-dimer switch for the 2-Cys Prxs."
https://openalex.org/W2000270473,"Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are associated with calcium entry activity in nonexcitable cells. TRPCs can form homo- or heterotetrameric channels, in which case they can assemble together within a subfamily groups. TRPC1, 4, and 5 represent one group, and TRPC3, 6, and 7 represent the other. The molecular determinants involved in promoting subunit tetramerization are not known. To identify them, we generated chimeras by swapping the different domains of TRPC4 with the same regions in TRPC6. We showed that TRPC4 coimmunoprecipitated with the chimeras containing the ankyrin repeats and coiled-coil domains of TRPC4 into TRPC6. However, chimeras containing only the ankyrin repeats or only the coiled-coil domain of TRPC4 did not coimmunoprecipitate with TRPC4. We also showed that a second domain of interaction composed of the pore region and the C-terminal tail is involved in the oligomerization of TRPC4. However, chimeras containing only the pore region or only the C-terminal tail of TRPC4 did not coimmunoprecipitate with TRPC4. Furthermore, we showed that the N terminus of TRPC6 coimmunoprecipitated with the C terminus of TRPC6. Overexpression in HEK293T cells of chimeras that contained an N terminus and a C terminus from different subfamily groups increased intracellular calcium entry subsequent to stimulation of G<sub>q</sub> protein-coupled receptors. These results suggest that two types of interactions are involved in the assembly of the four subunits of the TRPC channel. The first interaction occurs between the N termini and involves two regions. The second interaction occurs between the N terminus and the C terminus and does not appear to be necessary for the activity of TRPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2055010062,"The lysosomal protease cathepsin B has been proposed to protect cytotoxic T lymphocytes from the membrane-disruptive effects of perforin secreted during the execution phase of target cell death. Accordingly, cathepsin B that translocates to the lymphocyte surface upon degranulation has been postulated to cleave and inactivate perforin molecules that diffuse back to the killer cell. We have found that recombinant perforin is cleaved inefficiently by cathepsin B and shows no significant reduction in its lytic activity following co-incubation. Furthermore, purified CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes of cathepsin B-null gene-targeted mice were able to induce normal death of target cells both in vitro and in vivo and to survive the encounter with target cells as efficiently as cathepsin B-expressing killer cells. We conclude that cathepsin B is not essential for protection of cytotoxic lymphocytes from the toxic effects of their secreted perforin."

Because the pulses of released GnRH vary greatly in amplitude, we studied the biosynthetic response of the gonadotrope to varying GnRH concentrations, focusing on extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and egr1 mRNA and protein production. The overall average level of ERK activation in populations of cells increased non-cooperatively with increasing GnRH and did not show evidence of either ultrasensitivity or bistability. However, automated image analysis of single-cell responses showed that whereas individual gonadotropes exhibited two response states, inactive and active, both the probability of activation and the average response in activated cells increased with increasing GnRH concentration. These data indicate a hybrid single-cell response having both digital (switch-like) and analog (graded) features. Mathematical modeling suggests that the hybrid response can be explained by indirect thresholding of ERK activation resulting from the distributed structure of the GnRH-modulated network.

The hybrid response mechanism improves the reliability of noisy reproductive signal transmission from the brain to the pituitary. Mammalian reproduction and the survival of a species rely on a precise orchestration of temporally and spatially distributed molecular events. The control of reproduction represents a difficult engineering problem, because noisy molecular processes within cells that occur on time scales of minutes must regulate brain, pituitary, and gonadal activity in a process with an overall periodicity of days to weeks, depending on the species. At the center of this coordinated reproductive activity lies the pituitary gonadotrope, which converts hormone signals secreted by the brain into the biosynthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones controlling gonadal responses.

Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the response of the gonadotrope to varying concentrations of GnRH is important for understanding the design principles of this key response locus for mammalian physiology. GnRH directs two distinguishable gonadotrope activities, the biosynthesis of gonadotropins and their secretion. We focus here on the biosynthetic response. The GnRH receptor is a heptahelical G protein-coupled receptor that modulates a signaling network leading to activation of protein kinases and regulation of both transcription and translation (13Ruf F. Fink M.Y. Sealfon S.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2003; 24: 181-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The gene network responses include both primary genes, which are activated within the first 1 h of GnRH receptor activation by preformed transcription factors, secondary genes activated within the first 2 h and which require new protein synthesis, and tertiary genes, including gonadotropin subunits, that are induced after hours to days (13Ruf F.

ERK, which is activated by the addition of two phosphate groups on a Tyr and a Thr, is a GnRH-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Like all MAPKs, ERK is the final member of a triad of sequential kinases, referred to generically as MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase kinase kinase. The signaling mediator between the GnRH receptor and the MAP kinase kinase kinase in the gonadotrope has not been identified. Biochemical studies of cell signaling and gene regulation assay large populations of cells and quantify the average responses observed. Since the response at the level of the single cell may be heterogeneous, there is increasing interest in characterizing signaling and gene regulation within single cells (27Ferrell Jr., J.E.

In order to facilitate the accurate quantification of signaling and gene responses in a large number of cells and to determine the underlying distributions and mechanisms, we developed and validated an approach based on histological assays and automated image segmentation and feature extraction (32Chawla M.K. Lin G. Olson K. Vazdarjanova A. Burke S.N. Mc-Naughton B.L. Worley P.F. Guzowski J.F. Roysam B. Barnes C.A. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2004; 139: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The pituitary gonadotrope provides a physiologically important system in which to investigate the mechanisms underlying the response to varying concentrations of GnRH at the level of the MAPK ERK, egr1 gene induction, and Egr1 protein synthesis. We found that ERK phosphorylation, egr1 mRNA, and Egr1 protein induction followed a mixed analog/digital hybrid pattern of single-cell responses. Mathematical simulations undertaken to reconcile the average cell and single-cell data obtained suggest a unique mechanism of cross-talk between diverging GnRH-regulated signaling pathways. Cell Culture—LβT2 cells obtained from Prof. Pamela Mellon (University of California, San Diego, CA) were maintained at 37 °C/5% CO2 in humidified air in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini, Calabasas, CA) and l-glutamine. For histological assays, 200,000 cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-pretreated glass coverslips (number 1.5, 18 × 18 mm; Fisher) in 6-well plates. Cells were synchronized in 0.5% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and 25 mm Hepes. Viability Assay—Live/dead assay (L-3224; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Permeabilization with 0.1% saponin (Sigma) was used as a positive control. For trypan blue staining (catalog number 15250-061; Invitrogen), cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 10% dye suspension and counted in a hemocytometer. Immunohistochemistry—GnRH diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and 25 mm Hepes was added at 0, 4, 20, or 100 nm to synchronized cells (5 min for MEK and ERK, 60 min for Egr1). After 4% formaldehyde (ultrapure EM grade; Polysciences) for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilization in 0.2% Triton, 1× phosphate-buffered saline (Triton; Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature, and quenching in 50 mm NH4Cl (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature, blocking was performed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, 5% bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody (1:1000) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Secondary fluorophore-coupled antibody was added (1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 0.1 μg/ml; Sigma) counterstaining, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). The antibodies used were anti-Egr1 (catalog number sc-110; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-p42-p44 MAPK (catalog number 9106S; Cell Signaling), anti-MEK1/2 (catalog number 9122; Cell Signaling), anti-ERK1/2 (catalog number 9102; Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (catalog number 9121S; Cell Signaling), anti-p21 Waf1/Cip1 (BIOSOURCE), and secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes). Egr-1-blocking peptide was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-110P). MEK inhibitor PD98059 was used at 50 μm for 30 min before GnRH exposure. In Situ Hybridization—Fixation was identical to that for immunohistochemistry except for the use of 0.1% Triton, 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were prehybridized in 4× saline sodium citrate, 50% formamide, tRNA, unlabeled scrambled oligonucleotide, salmon sperm, and diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water for 1 h at room temperature then incubated with 60 ng of the specific labeled oligonucleotide probe for 2 h at 37°C. After washing with 2× saline sodium citrate at 52 °C on a water bath, cells were counterstained with DAPI before mounting with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent. The in situ hybridization probes were designed, synthesized, and labeled as described elsewhere (33Chan P. Gonzalez-Maeso J. Ruf F. Bishop D.F. Hof P.R. Sealfon S.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 482: 50-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34Chan P. Yuen T. Ruf F. Gonzalez-Maeso J. Sealfon S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e161Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Each 50-mer probe contained five amino-modified thymidine residues (Amino-Modifier C6 dT phosphoramidite; Glen Research, Sterling, VA) for the chemical conjugation with activated succinimidyl ester Alexa fluorophores (Molecular Probes). Probe sequences and modification sites are listed in supplemental Table 2. Fluorescent Microscopy and Data Analysis—A Zeiss LSM510-META inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope was used for confocal imaging. Imaging was achieved using a ×40/1.3 numerical aperture, or ×63/1.3 numerical aperture or ×100/1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. The blue diode laser of 405 nm with band pass emission filters of 420-480 nm was used for DAPI visualization. The HeNe laser of 543 nm was used for excitation of Alexa 568 and detected with a 570-nm long pass filter. The argon laser of 488 nm was used for the excitation of Alexa 488 and detected with a 515-540-nm band pass filter. Epifluorescence microscopy used an Olympus BX-60 microscope coupled with a BX-FLA reflected light fluorescence attachment and a CCD-based image analysis system. Each image field was captured as a digital image using the SPOT Advanced system (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). For triple- and double-labeled coverslips, images were captured sequentially and then merged in the SPOT Advanced program with Alexa 488 as the green panel, Alexa 568 as the red panel, and DAPI as the blue panel. The image was set to a pixel dimension of 1,520 Å ∼ 1,080 at a size of 21 Å ∼ 15 inches in color RGB mode. The digital images were transferred to a Macintosh PC and reduced bicubically in Adobe Photoshop 7.0. The exposure settings were determined empirically for each channel from control background and unchanged within an experiment. At least 10 images of nonoverlapping areas with 50-400 cells were assayed for each condition in each experiment. Automated Image Quantification and Data Processing—Digital images were analyzed in a custom automated image analysis suite called 3D-CatFISH (32Chawla M.K. Lin G. Olson K. Vazdarjanova A. Burke S.N.

Abdul-Karim M.A. Turner J.N. Shain W. Roysam B. Cytometry. 2005; 66: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). First, the cell nuclei were segmented using DAPI with the enhanced three-dimensional watershed algorithm (36Lin G. Adiga U. Olson K. Guzowski J.F. Barnes C.A. Roysam B. Cytometry. 2003; 56: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) followed by model-based object merging (37Lin G. Chawla M.K. Olson K. Guzowski J.F. Barnes C.A. Roysam B. Cytometry. 2004; 63: 20-33Google Scholar). Then a desired region of interest was defined based on geometric distance for each segmented nucleus, and specific signals were quantified in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The threshold was determined from values obtained for the vehicle-treated slides and maintained without changes for all of the other slides of each independent experiment. Each image was visually inspected for possible segmentation errors. Nuclear and cytoplasmic features such as volume, intensity, shape, and signal level were output for subsequent analysis. The lowest individual fluorescence levels were used to normalize across coverslips within each experiment and analyzed in Matlab using the Savitzky-Golay function (38Savitzky A. Golay M.J.E. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 1627-1639Crossref Scopus (15325) Google Scholar, 39Madden H. Anal. Chem. 1978; 50: 1383-1386Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and the curvefitting toolbox. Quantitative Real Time PCR—For quantitative real time PCR experiments, cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 750,000 cells/well. The medium was replaced 24 h later with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES (Mediatech), 10% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT), and glutamine. On the next day, the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of GnRH or vehicle and were returned to the CO2 incubator for the indicated time of incubation (40 min), at which point the medium was replaced with 360 μl of lysis buffer (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 0.5% N-lauroyl-sarcosine, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol). RNA was isolated according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (40Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated with the StrataPrep96 kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After reverse transcription of 0.5 μg of RNA, the samples were diluted 1:20 in distilled H2O. Later, SYBR green quantitative real time PCR assays were performed (40 cycles) using 5 μl of cDNA template and 5 μl of master mix containing the specific primers for the targeted gene and the required quantitative real time PCR buffers. The results were exported as Ct values for subsequent analysis. From the six replicates of each condition, the mean, S.D., and -fold changes to vehicle treatment were estimated and normalized to β-actin. The relative copy number of cDNA per assay was determined by running a standard curve with the PCR product for the specific gene. Immunoblot Analysis—5 million LβT2 cells grown in 10-mm dishes were synchronized in low serum for 24 h before GnRH treatment as described. After Nonidet P-40 lysis (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, NaCl) and centrifugation, 20 μg/well supernatant was loaded onto 10% Tris-HCl ready gel (Bio-Rad) and electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 100 V. After transfer to H-Bond membrane (Hybond-TM ECL; Amersham Biosciences), blocking for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in TBST (Tris-buffered saline and 1% Tween 20) was followed by overnight incubation in primary antibody (1:000) at 4 °C. Incubation with the secondary antibody (1:5000) coupled to peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed at room temperature for 45 min, followed by repeated washings with TBST. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In each case, the blots were stripped and reprobed for the total protein or a control protein to control loading amounts. All immunoblots were quantified by densitometry. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Doubly phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and total ERK assay kits (BIOSOURCE) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the LβT2 cells were grown in 6-well plates at 2.5 million cells/well and synchronized in low serum for 24 h. After treatment, cells were washed, lysed in cell extraction buffer (BIOSOURCE), boiled, and diluted (1:10) into assay buffer. Each sample was divided into two wells for assay of total and phospho-ERK. Fluorescent Assay Sensitivity Determination—1.8 μg/μl Alexa-568 nm (Molecular Probes) was serially diluted 1:2 in Me2SO. A GSM-417 microarray printer (Affymetrix) was used to spot dilution replicates on aminosilane-coated slides (Corning). The array was imaged using the epifluorescent microscope and analyzed as described above. For testing assay sensitivity in cells, fixed gonadotropes were incubated in serial diluted solutions of DAPI for 5 min. The coverslips were imaged and analyzed as described above. Mathematical Modeling—Statistical modeling used parameters obtained by fitting experimental data with two Gaussian curves using the curve-fitting toolbox of Matlab 7.0 (Mathworks), and the simulations were programmed in R. Stochastic modeling was coded in Fortran using Gillespie's algorithm (41Gillespie D.T. J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 2340-2361Crossref Scopus (7224) Google Scholar, 42Gillespie D.T. J. Chem. Phys. 2001; 115: 1716-1733Crossref Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Network simulations using dynamic modeling were programmed in Matlab. Full descriptions of the modeling assumptions and equations are found in the supplemental material. Average Gonadotrope Responses to Increasing Concentrations of GnRH Showed Graded Increases in the Activation of ERK and the Induction of egr1 mRNA and Egr1 Protein—We first characterized the average gonadotrope responses to GnRH in biochemical assays of large populations of LβT2 gonadotrope cells. In order to eliminate response variability arising from differences in cell cycle, cells were synchronized by low serum. Cell cycle synchronization was confirmed using p21 immunohistochemistry and cell viability by trypan blue exclusion and by a two-color live/dead membrane integrity and esterase activity assay (supplemental Fig. 1). Immunoblot analysis for active pERK in synchronized gonadotropes exposed to GnRH showed that the activated form reached maximal levels within the first few minutes and remained stable for about 40 min (Fig. 1A). Egr-1 protein was first detected after 30 min and continued to accumulate for the first 60 min after GnRH exposure. The induction of Egr1 protein paralleled the time course previously reported for the induction of egr1 mRNA (15Yuen T. Wurmbach E. Ebersole B.J. Ruf F. Pfeffer R.L. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In order to select the optimum time point to assay ERK, we determined the response to varying concentrations of GnRH over time and found that the level of pERK was stable from 5 to 30 min at all concentrations (supplemental Fig. 2). GnRH was found to induce a concentration-dependent increase in the average gonadotrope levels of pMEK (MAP kinase kinase), pERK, egr1 mRNA, and Egr1 protein (Fig. 1, B and C). The average responses determined by biochemical assays of large populations of cells could represent any of three different single-cell mechanisms: a graded (analog) model in which all cells show a similar concentration, a switch-like (digital) mechanism in which individual cells show an all-or-none response, or a hybrid analog/digital mechanism that combines features of both the graded and binary model (Fig. 1D). These mechanisms, which are all consistent with the biochemical results obtained, can only be distinguished by single-cell response assays. The activation of ERK involves two separate phosphorylation steps, and the levels of pERK depend on the effects of both kinase and phosphatase. Several mathematical models of the MAPK cascade suggest the theoretical importance of reversibility and product inhibition (43Cornish-Bowden A. Cardenas M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6616-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Ortega F. Acerenza L. Westerhoff H.V. Mas F. Cascante M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bistability and hysteresis can occur for some ranges of values of the rate constants (45Markevich N.I. Hoek J.B. Kholodenko B.N. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Hysteresis has been identified in cell cycle transitions in Xenopus oocytes (46Sha W. Moore J. Chen K. Lassaletta A.D. Yi C.S. Tyson J.J. Sible J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and in bacterial metabolism (47Ozbudak E.M. Thattai M. Lim H.N. Shraiman B.I. Van Oudenaarden A. Nature. 2004; 427: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Because determining the presence of hysteresis is important for elucidating the underlying signaling mechanism, we investigated the gonadotrope response for hysteresis, which has not been tested experimentally in mammalian signaling networks. Hysteresis is dependent on the history of the cells, in that the response of the LβT2 cells to a second concentration of GnRH might depend on the initial concentration of GnRH to which the cells were exposed. If the MAPK cascade showed bistability and hysteresis, then the average levels of pERK would be expected to diverge for cells exposed to increasing versus decreasing concentrations of GnRH. We studied whether hysteresis was observed in the activation of ERK by GnRH. We first determined that the level of pERK following a 10-min pulse of 100 nm GnRH returned to base line after 30-45 min (Fig. 2A). The levels of pERK were stable for 40 min with continuous GnRH (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we performed experiments in which LβT2 cells were pretreated with either 0.1 or 100 nm GnRH for 10 min before exposure to a different concentration of GnRH. The results of these experiments demonstrated identical concentration-response curves with a Hill coefficient near unity, whether starting at low or high GnRH concentrations (Fig. 2, B-D). Thus, we did not observe bistability or hysteresis in this response. Moreover, the observation of a low Hill value indicated that the average response was not ultrasensitive in these cells. Responses in Single Cells following GnRH Stimulation Identified a Hybrid Activation Model—In order to determine the type of single-cell response pattern occurring with varying concentration of GnRH, we quantified the activation of ERK and the induction of egr1 mRNA and Egr1 protein in single cells. To facilitate high throughput image analysis and eliminate subjectivity, we automated cell compartment segmentation using an enhanced three-dimensional watershed algorithm and modelbased object merging and subsequent signal quantification (supplemental Fig. 3) (32Chawla M.K. Lin G. Olson K. Vazdarjanova A. Burke S.N. Mc-Naughton B.L. Worley P.F. Guzowski J.F. Roysam B. Barnes C.A. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2004; 139: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We validated the automated analysis system by comparing results obtained for the same experimental data using manual and automated methods, which showed a high correlation (supplemental Fig. 4A). Using analysis of slides printed with varying fluorophore concentrations and cells labeled with different concentrations of a nuclear stain, we determined that the protocols utilized gave a reliable quantification of signal intensity (supplemental Fig. 4, B and C). Histological assays for doubly phosphorylated ERK identified two types of cellular responses: an uninduced population with cells having a level of fluorescence comparable with unstimulated cells and an induced population of cells with increased levels of fluorescence (Fig. 3, A and B).

Despite its importance, little is known about the regulation of chondrocyte apoptosis. We show that overexpression of annexin V, which binds to the cytoplasmic domain of β5 integrin and protein kinase C α (PKCα), stimulates apoptotic events in hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes. To determine whether the balance between the interactions of annexin V/β5 integrin and annexin V/active PKCα play a role in the regulation of terminally differentiated growth plate chondrocyte apoptosis, a peptide mimic of annexin V (Penetratin (Pen)-VVISYSMPD) that binds to β5 integrin but not to PKCα was used. This peptide stimulated apoptotic events in growth plate chondrocytes. Suppression of annexin V expression using small interfering ribonucleic acid decreased caspase-3 activity and increased cell viability in Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated growth plate chondrocytes. An activator of PKC resulted in a further decrease of cell viability and further increase of caspase-3 activity in Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated growth plate chondrocytes, whereas inhibitors of PKCα led to an increase of cell viability and decrease of caspase-3 activity of Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated cells. These findings suggest that binding of annexin V to active PKCα stimulates apoptotic events in growth plate chondrocytes and that binding of annexin Vto β5 integrin controls these interactions and ultimately apoptosis.

During endochondral ossification, the bone structures are first cartilaginous. Chondrocytes in these growth plate cartilages undergo a series of differentiation events, including proliferation, hypertrophy, and terminal differentiation, eventually leading to the replacement of mineralized cartilage by bone. Evolving in vitro and in vivo evidence shows that the final fate of terminally differentiated growth plate chondrocytes is apoptosis (programmed cell death) (1Gibson G.J. Kohler W.J. Schaffler M.B. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 2Hatori M. Klatte K.J. Teixeira C.C. Shapiro I.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1960-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that retinoic acid treatment of growth plate chondrocytes stimulates terminal differentiation events and eventually leads to apoptosis of these cells (3Wang W. Kirsch T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Wang W. Xu J. Kirsch T. J. Biol.

In addition, several in vivo studies have also revealed that apoptosis is the final fate of terminally differentiated growth plate chondrocytes. For example, we and others have demonstrated that apoptosis of growth plate chondrocytes occurs in chondrocytes at the chondro-osseous junction in chicken growth plate and sternal cartilage (1Gibson G.J.

Res. 2003; 18: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice with targeted disruptions of both alleles for the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 have short limbs and accelerated ossification of their growth plates (6Amling M. Neff L. Tanaka S. Inoue D. Kuida K. Weir E. Philbrick W.M. Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In addition, two chondrodysplastic conditions (parathyroid hormone-related peptide knock-out mice and activating mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR-3)) are associated with increased apoptosis of the growth plate chondrocytes (7Amizuka N.

The various differentiation events of growth plate chondrocytes, including apoptosis, are precisely regulated to allow coordinated longitudinal bone growth. A disturbance in the regulation of these events leads to growth retardation. For example, glucocorticoid treatment results in growth retardation by decreasing the proliferation rate of growth plate chondrocytes and by increasing the apoptosis rate of terminally differentiated growth plate chondrocytes (9Chrysis D. Ritzen E.M. Savendahl L. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 176: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Annefeld M. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1992; 188: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, the understanding of the mechanisms regulating the various differentiation events is highly relevant. However, very little is known about the regulation of apoptosis of growth plate chondrocytes. Recent studies have shown that annexin V, a cytosolic protein that binds to membranes in the presence of calcium, binds to the cytoplasmic domain of β5 integrin and to active protein kinase C α (PKCα) 2The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; Pen, Penetratin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; Myr, myristoylated; RCAS-BP, Rous sarcoma virus-based expression vector; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Bis-Tris, 2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-dioll; AnV, annexin V; siAnV, siRNA specific for AnV; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. and that these interactions play a key role in the regulation of apoptosis of endothelial cells (11Cardo-Vila M.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the interactions among annexin V, β5 integrin, and PKCα play a role in the regulation of apoptosis of growth plate chondrocytes. To address this hypothesis, we used a peptide mimic of annexin V, which has been shown to bind to β5 integrin and induce apoptosis in endothelial cells (11Cardo-Vila M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), overexpression of annexin V using a retroviral expression vector, and suppression of annexin V using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and determined cell viability, bcl-2 and bax expression, and caspase-3 activity. Reagents—The preparation and specificity of antibodies specific for annexin V were described previously (13Kirsch T. Swoboda B. Nah H.-D. Osteoarthr. Cartilage. 2000; 8: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for β5 integrin subunit were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The Penetratin (Pen) peptides (Pen-SDNRYIGSW and Pen-VVISYSMPD) were purchased from Global Peptide Services (Fort Collins, CO). Calphostin C, myristoylated (Myr)-PKCα/β, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from EMD Biosciences/Calbiochem. Myr-PKCζ was purchased from BIO-SOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Chondrocyte Culture—Chondrocytes were isolated from the hypertrophic zone of day 19 embryonic chick tibia growth plate cartilage as described previously (15Kirsch T. Nah H.D. Shapiro I.M. Pacifici M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) (complete medium). After 3 days, cells were incubated with high titer retroviral stocks of replication-competent, non-transforming Rous sarcoma virus-based expression vector (RCAS-BP) or RCAS-BP containing full-length annexin V cDNA in a small volume (5 × 106 colonyforming units/106 cells in less than 1 ml of medium) for 4 h. Thereafter, cells were cultured in complete medium until ∼90% of chondrocytes were infected. The degree of overexpression was detected by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for annexin V (16Wang W. Xu J. Kirsch T. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For siRNA experiments, growth plate chondrocytes were transfected with 200 nm siRNA specific for annexin V using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) (16Wang W. Xu J. Kirsch T. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were cultured in complete medium in the absence or presence of peptides and/or calphostin C (10 nm), PMA (3 μm), Myr-PKCα/β (100 μm), or Myr-PKCζ (100 μm). Construction and Production of Chicken Retrovirus RCAS-BP—Full-length annexin V cDNA was first cloned into an adaptor vector SLAX-myc, which contained a 10-amino acid epitope of human c-Myc tag fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of the recombinant protein and then subcloned into RCAS-BP (17Hughes S. Kosik E. Virology. 1984; 136: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To obtain viral stocks, the plasmid constructs and RCAS-BP containing no insert were used to transfect chicken embryonic dorsal fibroblasts using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent as described previously (16Wang W. Xu J. Kirsch T. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Construction of siRNA to Silence Annexin V Expression in Growth Plate Chondrocytes—We used the Silencer siRNA construction kit from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX) to synthesize siRNA. Four pairs of oligonucleotides encoding the desired sense and antisense siRNA strands were designed according to the chicken annexin V sequence by using a computer program (Ambion Inc.) Oligonucleotides were designed to include an 8-base sequence complementary to the 5′ end of T7 promoter primer included in the kit. The procedure was performed as described previously (16Wang W. Xu J. Kirsch T. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The different siRNAs were tested for the efficiency to suppress annexin V protein expression in 10-day embryonic chicken dorsal fibroblasts to select the most effective siRNAs for transfection of growth plate chondrocytes. The sequences of the most efficient oligonucleotides were: antisense, 5′-AAGCATGCAATCAAGGGAGCACCTGTCTC-3′, and sense, 5′-AATGCTCCCTTGATTGCATGCCCTGTCTC-3′. Double Immunofluorescence and Peptide Internalization and Visualization—Cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml biotinylated peptides. After 2 h, the cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, permeabilized with ethanol/acetic acid (9:1, v/v) for 5 min at -20 °C, blocked for 30 min with goat serum, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h. After washing, cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon). Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). For double immunostaining for β5 integrin and annexin V, cells were washed, fixed with ethanol, and incubated with primary mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for β5 integrin and rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for annexin V. After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) and analyzed by inverted fluorescence microscopy (Nikon). For double immunostaining of 10-μm-thick paraffin sections of day 19 embryonic chicken growth plate, sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then pretreated with 2 mg/ml sheep testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C. After blocking, sections were immunostained with primary and secondary antibodies as described above. Caspase-3 Activity and Cell Viability Assays—Caspase-3 activity was measured using the ApoAlert caspase fluorescent assay kit (Clontech) as described previously (4Wang W. Xu J. Kirsch T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3762-3769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activity was normalized to the protein content in each culture. Caspase-3 activity is expressed as relative units, with caspase-3 activity of the untreated or uninfected culture set as 1. Cell viability was determined by measurement of the cellular metabolism of MTT (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—To determine the amount of annexin V in growth plate chondrocytes, cells were lysed in NuPAGE SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Thirty micrograms of total protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Before electrophoresis, the reducing agent was added to the sample solution, denatured at 70 °C for 10 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis in 10% Bis-Tris gels following the NuPAGE electrophoresis protocols. Samples were electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose filters after electrophoresis. After blocking with a solution of low fat milk protein, blotted proteins were immunostained with primary antibodies and then peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and the signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Statistical Analysis—Numerical data are presented as mean ± S.D. (n ≥ 3), and statistical significance between groups was identified using the two-tailed Student's t test (p values are reported in the figure legends). The β5 integrin subunit was expressed in hypertrophic growth plate cartilage (Fig. 1A). Double immunostaining revealed that cells in type X collagen-positive regions were immunostained with antibodies specific for the β5 integrin subunit (Fig. 1A), whereas the proliferative zone of growth plate cartilage showed no staining for type X collagen and β5 integrin (Fig. 1A). Type X collagen staining was localized in the extracellular matrix, whereas β5 integrin staining was cellular. Annexin V is also expressed in the hypertrophic region of growth plate cartilage (Fig. 1A) (see also Ref. 13Kirsch T. Swoboda B. Nah H.-D. Osteoarthr. Cartilage. 2000; 8: 294-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, annexin V, β5 integrin, and type X collagen are highly expressed in the hypertrophic region of growth plate cartilage. A previous study has shown that annexin V binds to the cytosolic domain of the β5 integrin subunit (11Cardo-Vila M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Double immunostaining with antibodies specific for β5 integrin and annexin V revealed a co-localization of both proteins in hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes in culture (Fig. 1B), confirming previous findings showing an interaction between annexin V and the β5 integrin subunit (11Cardo-Vila M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine the role of annexin V and its interactions with β5 integrin, we overexpressed annexin V in hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes using the retroviral expression vector RCAS-BP. Infection of growth plate chondrocytes with RCAS-BP containing full-length annexin V cDNA (Fig. 2A, AnV/RCAS) resulted in a notable increase (2-3-fold) of annexin V protein expression when compared with the expression levels of uninfected or RCAS-BP-infected (Fig. 2A, Uninfected, RCAS) growth plate chondrocytes. Overexpression of full-length annexin V led to a decrease of bcl-2 expression and increases of bax expression and caspase-3 activity when compared with the levels of RCAS-infected cells (Fig. 3, A and B, AnV/RCAS, RCAS). To determine whether annexin V and β5 integrin interactions are involved in mediating apoptotic events in growth plate chondrocytes, we used a peptide mimic of annexin V (VVISYSMPD) that has been shown to bind to β5 integrin and trigger cell death of endothelial cells (11Cardo-Vila M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We synthesized an internalizing version of the peptide by using the Pen system for intracellular delivery. Pen, a peptide containing 16 amino acids that are part of the third helix of the Antennapedia protein homeodomain, has translocating properties and therefore is capable of carrying hydrophilic compounds across the plasma membrane and delivering them to the cytoplasmic space without degradation (18Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We fused the peptide mimic of annexin V (VVISYSMPD) or a control unrelated peptide (SDNRYIGSW) to Pen and added a biotin moiety to visualize internalization. Both Pen-VVISYSMPD peptide and the control peptide were internalized and uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, Pen-SDNRYIGSW, Pen-VVISYSMPD). Cells not incubated with these peptides showed no cytoplasmic fluorescence staining (Fig. 2B, Control). Treatment of growth plate chondrocytes with 12 μm Pen-VVISYSMPD for 6 h resulted in a decreased expression of the antiapoptotic factor bcl-2 and an increased expression of the apoptotic factor bax when compared with the expression levels of untreated cells (Fig. 3A, Pen-VVISYSMPD, Control). Cells treated with the control peptide showed similar expression levels of bcl-2 and bax as untreated cells (Fig. 3A, Pen-SDNRYIGSW, Control). Treatment of growth plate chondrocytes with 12 μm Pen-VVISYSMPD for 24 h led to a notable increase of caspase-3 activity when compared with untreated cells or cells treated with Pen-SDNRYIGSW (Fig. 3B, Pen-VVISYSMPD, Pen-SDNRYIGSW, Control).FIGURE 3Bcl-2 and bax gene expression and caspase-3 activity of growth plate chondrocytes. A, gene expression of bcl-2 and bax was detected using quantitative real-time PCR in Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated, Pen-SDNRYIGSW-treated, or AnV/RCAS-infected growth plate chondrocytes after a 6-h treatment or a 5-day infection. B, apoptosis was determined by measuring caspase-3 activity after a 24-h treatment with the peptides or a 7-day infection. Treatment with annexin V-mimicking peptide (Pen-VVISYSMPD) or infection with AnV/RCAS resulted in up-regulation of gene expression of bax and caspase-3 activity and down-regulation of bcl-2 gene expression when compared with the levels in untreated (Control), Pen-SDNRYIGSW-treated, or RCAS-infected (RCAS) cells. Data were obtained from triplicated PCR reaction of three different cultures or from caspase-3 activities from three different cultures and were expressed as mean ± S.D. (AnV/RCAS versus RCAS; Pen-VVISYSMPD versus control; *, p ≤ 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we determined whether Pen-VVISYSMPD and β5 integrin are sufficient to induce apoptotic events in growth plate chondrocytes or whether full-length annexin V is also required. Therefore, we suppressed annexin V expression in Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated growth plate chondrocytes using siRNA technology and measured cell viability and caspase-3 activity. Using annexin V-specific siRNA, annexin V expression was notably suppressed in hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes (annexin V expression was suppressed by ∼70%; Fig. 4, siAnV). Pen-VVISYSMPD treatment reduced the cell viability to ∼40% (Fig. 5A, Pen-VVISYSMPD). The control peptide Pen-SDNRYIGSW did not affect cell viability (Fig. 5A, Pen-SDNRYIGSW). Transfecting cells with siRNA specific for annexin V or treatment with Pen-SDNRYIGSW (control peptide) and transfection with annexin V-specific siRNA also did not affect cell viability (Fig. 5A, siAnV, Pen-SDNRYIGSW/siAnV). However, suppression of annexin V expression led to an increase of cell viability in Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated growth plate chondrocytes (Fig. 5A, Pen-VVISYSMPD/siAnV).FIGURE 5Cell viability evaluated by MTT assay and caspase-3 activity of untreated (Control), Pen-SDNRYIGSW-treated (Pen-SDNRYIGSW), Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated (Pen-VVISYSMPD), annexin V-specific siRNA-transfected (siAnV), siAnV-transfected and Pen-SDNRYIGSW-treated (Pen-SDNRYIGSW/siAnV), and siAnV-transfected and Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated (Pen-VVISYSMPD/siAnV) growth plate chondrocytes. Pen-VVISYSMPD treatment reduced cell viability (A) and increased caspase-3 activity (B) when compared with the levels in Pen-SDNRYIGSW-treated cells. However, annexin V-specific siRNA inhibited the effects of Pen-VVISYSMPD on cell viability (A) and caspase-3 activity (B). Data were obtained from three different cultures and were expressed as mean ± S.D. (Pen-VVISYSMPD versus control; *, p ≤ 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pen-VVISYSMPD treatment resulted in ∼5-fold increase of caspase-3 activity in growth plate chondrocytes when compared with the activity of untreated cells (Fig. 5B, Pen-VVISYSMPD, Control). Caspase-3 activity was markedly decreased in Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated cells transfected with annexin V-specific siRNA when compared with the levels in Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated cells (Fig. 5B, Pen-VVISYSMPD/siAnV, Pen-VVISYSMPD). Transfection of growth plate chondrocytes with annexin V-specific siRNA, treatment with Pen-SDNRYIGSW, or treatment with Pen-SDNRYIGSW (control peptide) and transfection with annexin V-specific siRNA had no effect on caspase-3 activity (Fig. 5B, siAnV, Pen-SDNRYIGSW, Pen-SDNRYIGSW/siAnV). Annexin V has been shown not only to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the β5 integrin subunit but also to bind to active PKCα (11Cardo-Vila M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Schlaepfer D.D. Jones H. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Binding of annexin V to active PKCα inhibits PKCα activity (12Schlaepfer D.D. Jones H. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Rothhut B. Dubois T. Feliers D. Russo-Marie F. Oudinet J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since active PKCα has been shown to be involved in mediating cell survival of chondrocytes (20Kim S.J. Kim H.G. Oh C.D. Hwang S.G. Song W.K. Yoo Y.J. Kang S.S. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30375-30381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we asked whether inhibition of PKCα through annexin V and/or annexin V/β5 integrin interactions may play a role in mediating apoptosis of growth plate chondrocytes using an activator of PKC (PMA) or generic inhibitors of PKC (calphostin) or subtype-specific PKC inhibitors (Myr-PKCα/β, Myr-PKCζ). Treatment of growth plate chondrocytes with PMA, calphostin, or Pen-SDNRYIGSW did not alter cell viability or caspase-3 activity when compared with cell viability and caspase-3 activity of untreated cells (Fig. 6, A and B, PMA, Calphostin, Pen-SDNRYIGSW, Control). Co-treatment with Pen-SDNRYIGSW and PMA or calphostin also did not alter cell viability or caspase-3 activity (Fig. 6, A and B, Pen-SDNRYIGSW/PMA, Pen-SDNRYIGSW/Cal.). PMA further reduced cell viability of Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated cells (from ∼40% for Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated cells to ∼25% for Pen-VVISYSMPD- and PMA-treated cells) (Fig. 6A, Pen-VVISYSMPD, Pen-VVISYSMPD/PMA), whereas calphostin increased cell viability of Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated cells (∼80% viability in Pen-VVISYSMPD and calphostin-treated cells when compared with ∼40% viability in Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated cells) (Fig. 6A, Pen-VVISYSMPD, Pen-VVISYSMPD/Cal.). Similar results were obtained for caspase-3 activity. Pen-VVISYSMPD and PMA treatment (Fig. 6B, Pen-VVISYSMPD/PMA) further increased caspase-3 activity when compared with the activity in Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated cells. On the other hand, co-treatment with Pen-VVISYSMPD and calphostin (Fig. 6B, Pen-VVISYSMPD/Cal.) decreased caspase-3 activity to levels similar to those of untreated (Fig. 6B, Control) cells. Next, we tested whether PKC regulation by annexin V/β5 integrin interactions is specific for PKCα. We treated growth plate chondrocytes with Pen-VVISYSMPD and Myr-PKCα/β (specific for PKCα) or Myr-PKCζ (specific for PKC ζ). In the absence of Pen-VVISYSMPD, Myr-PKCα/β did not change cell morphology and viability when compared with the morphology and viability of untreated cultures (Fig. 7, A, Untreated, Myr-PKCα,β, and B, white bars, Untreated, Myr-PKCα,β). However, Myr-PKCζ treatment in the absence of Pen-VVISYSMPD resulted in a notable decrease of growth plate chondrocyte viability (Fig. 7B, white bars, Myr-PKCζ). As already shown above, treatment of growth plate chondrocytes with Pen-VVISYSMPD resulted in a morphological appearance of dead cells (Fig. 7A, Pen-VVISYSMPD) and a marked decrease of growth plate chondrocyte viability when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 7B). Pen-SDNRYIGSW-treated cells showed a similar morphology as untreated cells (Fig. 7A, Untreated, Pen-SDNRYIGSW). Myr-PKCα/β and Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated growth plate chondrocytes had a morphological appearance similar to untreated cells (Fig. 7A, Untreated, Pen-VVISYSMPD/Myr-PKCα,β). In addition, Myr-PKCα/β led to an increase of cell viability of Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated growth plate chondrocytes (Fig. 7B, black bars, Myr-PKCα,β). Myr-PKCζ resulted in a further decrease of cell viability of Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated growth plate chondrocytes (Fig. 7B, black bars, Myr-PKCζ). In this study, we provide evidence that the balance between annexin V/β5 integrin and annexin V/PKCα interactions plays a role in the regulation of growth plate chondrocyte apoptosis. Apoptosis is the final fate of terminally differentiated growth plate chondrocytes and is required for normal endochondral bone formation (2Hatori M. Klatte K.J. Teixeira C.C. Shapiro I.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1960-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Gibson G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Disturbance of apoptosis in growth plate cartilage results in abnormal bone development. For example, bcl-2 knock-out mice show accelerated chondrocyte differentiation and apoptosis, resulting in accelerated endochondral bone formation and short stature of these mice (6Amling M. Neff L. Tanaka S. Inoue D. Kuida K. Weir E. Philbrick W.M. Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Our results show that a peptide mimic of annexin V (Pen-VVISYSMPD) that binds to β5 integrin but not to PKCα (11Cardo-Vila M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) stimulates apoptotic events in hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes. Similarly, overexpression of annexin V in hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes increased caspase-3 activity and the proapoptotic bax gene expression and decreased expression of the antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene, suggesting that high expression of annexin V in growth plate chondrocytes results in apoptosis of these cells. On the other hand, suppression of annexin V in hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes using siRNA resulted in an increase of cell viability and a decrease of caspase-3 activity in Pen-VVISYSMPD-treated growth plate chondrocytes, further confirming our model that both the interactions between β5 integrin and annexin V (or its peptide mimic) and the interactions between annexin V and PKCα are required for the regulation of growth plate chondrocyte apoptosis. Annexin V and β5 integrin are expressed by hypertrophic and terminally differentiated chondrocytes in gro"
https://openalex.org/W1976066740,"The earliest generation of stars, far from being a mere novelty, transformed the universe from darkness to light. The first atoms to form after the Big Bang filled the universe with atomic hydrogen and a few light elements. As gravity pulled gas clouds together, the first stars ignited and their radiation turned the surrounding atoms into ions. By looking at gas between us and distant galaxies, we know that this ionization eventually pervaded all space, so that few hydrogen atoms remain today between galaxies. Knowing exactly when and how it did so is a primary goal of cosmologists, because this would tell us when the early stars formed and in what kinds of galaxies. Although this ionization is beginning to be understood by using theoretical models and computer simulations, a new generation of telescopes is being built that will map atomic hydrogen throughout the universe."
https://openalex.org/W2016833067,"In a recent study on the reducing requirement for the methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msr) (Sagher, D., Brunell, D., Hejtmancik, J. F., Kantorow, M., Brot, N. & Weissbach, H. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In a search for another reducing agent for hMsrB2 and hMsrB3, it was recently found that thionein, the reduced, metal-free form of metallothionein, could function as a reducing system for hMsrB3, with weaker activity using hMsrB2. In the present study, we provide evidence that some selenium compounds are potent reducing agents for both hMsrB2 and hMsrB3."

A recent addition to this class is the enzyme PchB, an 11.4-kDa isochorismate pyruvate lyase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Many bacteria produce low molecular mass, high affinity iron chelators called siderophores in response to an iron-limiting environment, such as that found in a host organism. Siderophores are produced in a multistep biosynthetic process, secreted into the environment where they bind available iron (frequently out-competing host organism enzymes for the iron), and are then reinternalized for iron use by the pathogen (1Sriyosachati S.

Reimmann C. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16893-16898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Salicylate is then produced from isochorismate by a second enzyme, PchB (13Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PchA is a putative structural homologue of salicylate-producing enzymes of the siderophore biosynthetic pathways from Y. entercolitica and M. tuberculosis, Irp9 and Mbt1, respectively. Irp9, a 50-kDa enzyme with a complex α/β fold, is a structural homologue of the chorismate-utilizing enzymes anthranilate synthase (TrpE subunit) and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase (PabB subunit) (10Kerbarh O. Chirgadze D.Y. Blundell T.L. Abell C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 524-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MbtI is proposed to be a functional and structural homologue of Irp9 for which preliminary crystallographic information has been reported (6Harrison A.J. Ramsay R.J. Baker E.N. Lott J.S. Acta Crystallogr Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Quadri L.E. Sello J. Keating T.A. Weinreb P.H. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Both Irp9 and MbtI are bifunctional salicylate synthases that catalyze the production of salicylate from chorismate using a two-step process with an isochorismate intermediate (9Kerbarh O. Ciulli A. Howard N.I. Abell C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5061-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, neither Irp9 nor MbtI shares any sequence similarity with PchB.The physiological role of PchB is as an isochorismate pyruvate lyase (IPL) 2The abbreviations used are: IPL, isochorismate pyruvate lyase; CM, chorismate mutase; EcCM, E. coli CM; TSA, transition state analogue. 2The abbreviations used are: IPL, isochorismate pyruvate lyase; CM, chorismate mutase; EcCM, E. coli CM; TSA, transition state analogue. (Fig. 1a), but PchB shows no sequence similarity to other pyruvate lyases, which proceed through a general base mechanism (16Nakai T. Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Takeda S. Jhee K.H.

Instead, PchB shares 20% sequence identity with chorismate mutases of the AroQ family α subclass, which use a Claisen rearrangement mechanism (13Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Okvist M. Dey R. Sasso S. Grahn E. Kast P. Krengel U. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1483-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, PchB has an additional catalytic activity as a chorismate mutase (CM) to produce prephenate (Fig. 1b) (13Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In terms of kcat/Km, the catalytic efficiency of PchB performing the CM reaction is two orders of magnitude less than that of the physiological IPL reaction (13Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To provide a structural frame-work for understanding the PchB catalytic mechanisms, we solved the structures of apo and pyruvate-bound PchB.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPchB Cloning and Protein ExpressionPchB-His6—The pchB gene was cloned from P. aeruginosa PAO1 genomic DNA by PCR. The forward primer (5′-TGG CGT ATC ATA TGA AAA CTC CGA A-3′) was designed to include a 5′ NdeI restriction enzyme site, and the reverse primer (5′-TTT AGA AAG CTT TGC GGC ACC CCG-3′) was designed to include a 3′ HindIII site. The PCR product was digested with NdeI/HindIII and inserted into the pET29b vector (Novagen). The resultant plasmid, which encodes the pchB gene with a C-terminal histidine tag, was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Protein was expressed in cells grown in Luria Bertani medium at 37 °C and 250 rpm. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of ∼0.7, and the cells were harvested after 3 h by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Cells were resuspended in ∼10 ml 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl (buffer A) per liter of harvested cells and stored at -80 °C for purification.PchB—A second overexpression system was generated to incorporate the naturally occurring stop codon and thus remove the C-terminal histidine tag. The QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and two complementary primers encoding the desired change (5′-CGG GGT GCC GCA TAA TAA AAG CTT GCG GCC-3′, 5′-GGC CGC AAG CTT TTA TTA TGC GGC ACC CCG-3′) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions.Protein PurificationPchB-His6—The cells were lysed by passage through a French Press three times. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell extract was applied to a Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column charged with nickel chloride and pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A supplemented with 5 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with a 10-column volume 0-0.3 m imidazole gradient in buffer A. Fractions containing PchB-His6 eluted at ∼0.25 m imidazole. The collected fractions were concentrated, and the protein was further purified on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The purified PchB-His6 was concentrated to 28.7 mg/ml (determined by the Bradford assay) and stored at -80 °C for crystallization.PchB—The cells were lysed and the lysate clarified as described above for PchB-His6. The cell extract was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein was eluted with a 10-column volume 0-0.5 m NaCl gradient in the pre-equilibration buffer. Fractions containing PchB eluted at ∼0.1 m NaCl. The collected fractions were concentrated, and the protein was further purified using the Superdex 75 gel filtration column as described above for PchB-His6.The purified PchB was concentrated to 68 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C for crystallization.Isochorismate Pyruvate Lyase and Chorismate Mutase Activity—To ensure that purified PchB (both with and without the C-terminal histidine tag) was enzymatically active, the protein samples were subjected to assays for the known catalytic activities of PchB. Both His-tagged and untagged PchB demonstrated isochorismate pyruvate lyase activity using a coupled assay with PchA (isochorismate synthase) as previously described (data not shown) (13Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Both forms of PchB also demonstrated chorismate mutase activity using a previously reported protocol (data not shown) (13Gaille C. Kast P. Haas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21768-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Protein CrystallizationPchB-His6—Crystallization was carried out by the hanging drop method at 25 °C. Drops containing 1.5-3 μl of purified PchB-His6 protein were mixed with equal volumes of a reservoir solution composed of 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4.7, and 4.8-5.3 m ammonium nitrate. Large square pyramidal crystals formed after 48 h. These crystals and the structure determined from these crystals will henceforth be called “apo.”PchB—Crystallization was carried out by the hanging drop method at 25 °C. Immediately prior to crystallization, the purified PchB protein was diluted to 20 mg/ml in the buffer used for gel filtration chromatography with 17 mm pyruvate and incubated on ice for 30 min. Drops containing 1 μl of this protein/pyruvate solution were mixed with a reservoir solution composed of 100 mm ADA (N-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid), pH 7.0, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.15 m calcium acetate, and 10% glycerol. Large rod-shaped crystals appeared in 5-7 days and continued to grow to full size over 2-3 weeks. These crystals and the structure determined from these crystals will henceforth be called “pyruvate bound.”Determination of PchB-His6 Fragment SizeCrystals of PchB-His6 dissolved in water and subjected to SDS-PAGE gave a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of 11 kDa, indicating that the crystals contained a fragment of the original PchB-His6 construct rather than the full-length protein with the C-terminal histidine tag. Further analysis of dissolved crystals by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry indicated a fragment with a mass of 11294.2 Da (experiments conducted by the University of Kansas Molecular Structures Group Mass Spectrometry Laboratory; www.msg.k-u.edu/%7Emsg/mass.html). Dissolved crystals were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing, which indicated that the N terminus was intact (experiments conducted by the Kansas State University Biotech Core Facility; www.k-state.edu/bchem/biotech/). We conclude that PchB-His6 was proteolyzed in the crystallization drop, removing amino acids 100 and 101 and the C-terminal His tag and allowing amino acids 1-99 to crystallize (Table 1). These results are consistent with the refined structure.TABLE 1Summary of the two PchB samples and structuresProtein sampleAmino acids in constructAmino acids crystallizedApo1–101 + His tag1–99Pyruvate bound1–1011–101PchB in structureOrdered amino acidsIons in active siteApoMonomer A1–41; 50–96NitrateMonomer B1–41; 49–92NitratePyruvate boundMonomer A1–41; 52–94PyruvateMonomer B2–41; 48–94PyruvateMonomer C1–982 PyruvatesMonomer D1–1002 Pyruvates Open table in a new tab Data CollectionApo Protein—For data collection, apo crystals were transferred to the reservoir solution supplemented with 14% (v/v) glycerol as a cryosolvent and flash cooled at -160 °C.

For data collection, the crystals were transferred briefly to a cryosolvent composed of 30% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m calcium acetate, and 20% glycerol and then flashed cooled at -160 °C. These crystals were initially assigned to the space group P222 with unit cell dimensions a = 54.5 Å, b = 74.5 Å, c = 88.9 Å. Data collection and processing were completed as described above for the apo crystals.Structure Solution and RefinementApo—Molecular replacement calculations were performed using the program Phaser (21McCoy A.J.

Crystallgr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), the data from 25 to 2.5 Å, and all possible space groups of the P422 subgroup. The E. coli chorismate mutase structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1ECM) (22Lee A.Y. Karplus P.A. Ganem B. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3627-3628Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was used as a search model, yielding a clear solution in the space group P43212 with a log likelihood gain of 132.5 and no unrelated peaks higher than 75% of the difference between the top and the mean value. The map generated with this solution indicated extra density at the N terminus compared with the molecular replacement model and an area lacking density in the loop between the first and second helices. These two differences in electron density relative to the 1ECM molecular replacement model indicate a correct solution, because the map is not merely demonstrating the phase bias from the search model. After model building in the program XtalView (23McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar), refinement was conducting by simulated annealing and individual temperature factor refinement using CNS (24Brunger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar). The final model contains two intertwined monomers per asymmetric unit. Monomer A comprises residues 1-41 and 50-96, whereas monomer B comprises residues 1-41 and 49-92. The model also includes 55 water molecules and 5 nitrate ions. A Ramachandran plot generated with PROCHECK (25Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26Crossref Google Scholar) shows that the model exhibits good geometry, with 97.3% of the residues in the most favored regions and 2.7% of the residues in the additionally allowed regions. Refinement statistics are in Table 2.Pyruvate Bound—Molecular replacement calculations were performed by AutoMolRep in the CCP4 program package using data from 50 to 3 Å resolution (26Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallgr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19698) Google Scholar). The apo structure (above) was used as a search model, yielding a clear solution in the space group P212121 with two dimers in the asymmetric unit. This solution had a correlation coefficient of 0.55 and an Rfactor of 0.45 (compared with the second unrelated peak with correlation coefficient of 0.27 and Rfactor of 0.57). The map generated with this solution indicated extra density in two of the monomers, corresponding to the ordering of the loop between the first and second helices. After model building in the program XtalView (23McRee D.E. J. Struct.

Monomer A, which is composed of residues 1-41 and 52-94, forms a dimer with Monomer B, composed of residues 2-41 and 48-94. Monomer C (residues 1-98) forms a dimer with monomer D (residues 1-100). Included in the model are 6 pyruvate molecules, 181 water molecules, and a Ca2+ ion (at a crystal contact). A Ramachandran plot generated with PROCHECK (25Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26Crossref Google Scholar) shows that the model exhibits good geometry, with 97.7% of the residues in the most favored regions and 2.2% of the residues in the additionally allowed regions.Structural Analysis and ModelingStructural Alignment—The structural alignments and calculations of root mean square deviations were all done using LSQMAN in the DEJAVU program package (27Kleywegt G.J.

The structure was determined by molecular replacement using E. coli chorismate mutase (EcCM; Protein Data Bank accession code 1ECM) (22Lee A.Y. Karplus P.A. Ganem B. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3627-3628Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar) as a search model. The asymmetric unit contains two PchB monomers, each composed of three α-helices connected by loops to form an intertwined dimer (Fig. 2a). Several residues are disordered in both monomers, including eight to nine amino acids in the loop connecting the first and second helices and between three and seven amino acids at the C termini (Table 1).FIGURE 2Comparison of the PchB structures and the E. coli chorismate mutase structure. a, PchB apo structure.

The asymmetric unit for this crystal system contains two dimers of the same overall structure as the apo protein (Fig. 2b). One dimer (monomers A and B) has two open active sites as in the apo structure with disordered loops between the first and second helices and disordered C termini. In contrast, in the other dimer (monomers C and D), the corresponding loops are ordered and form a closed active site. Also, one additional turn of a C-terminal helix in each monomer is ordered.

The only differences are found in the loop regions leading up to the regions of disorder. The overall root mean square difference for the superposition of the PchB structures with the E. coli chorismate mutase is 1.19 Å (for all three comparisons) for 154 to 155 Cα (for the apo and open pyruvate-bound structures, respectively) and 173 Cα for the closed pyruvate-bound structure. As evident in Fig. 4, a and b, the primary area of difference between the closed pyruvate-bound PchB structure and the inhibitor-bound EcCM structure is in the loop that closes over the active site (the same loop that is disordered in the open structures) and at the termini.

https://openalex.org/W2092703654,"We have previously shown that DNA polymerase ϵ (Pol ϵ)of Saccharomyces cerevisiae binds stably to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), a property not generally associated with DNA polymerases. Here, by reconstituting Pol ϵ activity from Pol2p-Dpb2p and Dpb3p-Dpb4p, its two component subassemblies, we report that Dpb3p-Dpb4p, a heterodimer of histone-fold motif-containing subunits, is responsible for the dsDNA binding. Substitution of specific lysine residues in Dpb3p, highlighted by homology modeling of Dpb3p-Dpb4p based on the structure of the histone H2A-H2B dimer, indicated that they play roles in binding of dsDNA by Dpb3p-Dpb4p, in a manner similar to the histone-DNA interaction. The lysine-substituted dpb3 mutants also displayed reduced telomeric silencing, whose degree paralleled that of the dsDNA-binding activity of Pol ϵ in the corresponding dpb3 mutants. Furthermore, additional amino acid substitutions to lysines in Dpb4p, to compensate for the loss of positive charges in the Dpb3p mutants, resulted in simultaneous restoration of dsDNA-binding activity by Pol ϵ and telomeric silencing. We conclude that the dsDNA-binding property of Pol ϵ is required for epigenetic silencing at telomeres. We have previously shown that DNA polymerase ϵ (Pol ϵ)of Saccharomyces cerevisiae binds stably to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), a property not generally associated with DNA polymerases. Here, by reconstituting Pol ϵ activity from Pol2p-Dpb2p and Dpb3p-Dpb4p, its two component subassemblies, we report that Dpb3p-Dpb4p, a heterodimer of histone-fold motif-containing subunits, is responsible for the dsDNA binding. Substitution of specific lysine residues in Dpb3p, highlighted by homology modeling of Dpb3p-Dpb4p based on the structure of the histone H2A-H2B dimer, indicated that they play roles in binding of dsDNA by Dpb3p-Dpb4p, in a manner similar to the histone-DNA interaction. The lysine-substituted dpb3 mutants also displayed reduced telomeric silencing, whose degree paralleled that of the dsDNA-binding activity of Pol ϵ in the corresponding dpb3 mutants. Furthermore, additional amino acid substitutions to lysines in Dpb4p, to compensate for the loss of positive charges in the Dpb3p mutants, resulted in simultaneous restoration of dsDNA-binding activity by Pol ϵ and telomeric silencing. We conclude that the dsDNA-binding property of Pol ϵ is required for epigenetic silencing at telomeres. In eukaryotic cells, compaction of DNA into the higher order structure of chromatin involves many highly regulated steps and is required when cells go through S-phase in which the chromatin is temporarily unpacked for DNA replication (1Krude T. Keller C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Epigenetic information on maintenance of both silenced and expressed states of chromatin must also be properly propagated during S-phase for these epigenetic states to be stably transmitted to subsequent generations (2Franco A.A. Kaufman P.D. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2004; 69: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, duplication of both chromosomal DNA and its chromatin states are tightly coupled processes. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen, one of the key components in the replication machinery serving as a platform for recruiting replication proteins (3Maga G. Hubscher U. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), is considered to be a factor connecting DNA replication to chromatin assembly, most probably by directing chromatin assembly factor I to replicated DNA (4Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). As proliferating cell nuclear antigen mutants defective for chromatin assembly factor I interaction show reduced silencing (5Zhang Z. Shibahara K. Stillman B. Nature. 2000; 408: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), replication-coupled chromatin assembly mediated by these proteins is suggested to be a step required for proper inheritance of epigenetic chromatin structures. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA polymerase ϵ (Pol ϵ), 4The abbreviations used are: Pol ϵ, DNA polymerase ϵ; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; 5-FOA, 5-fluoro-orotic acid; SC, synthetic complete; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MOPS, 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid. 4The abbreviations used are: Pol ϵ, DNA polymerase ϵ; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; 5-FOA, 5-fluoro-orotic acid; SC, synthetic complete; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MOPS, 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid. another major component in DNA replication, has recently been shown to participate in the stable inheritance of the silenced state of chromatin (6Iida T. Araki H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Pol ϵ is a four-subunit complex comprising the catalytic subunit, Pol2p, and three auxiliary subunits, Dpb2p, Dpb3p, and Dpb4p (7Araki H. Hamatake R.K. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4945-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Among the auxiliary subunits, Dpb3p and Dpb4p contain a histone-fold motif (11Ohya T. Maki S. Kawasaki Y. Sugino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3846-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Li Y. Pursell Z.F. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23247-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a structural motif originally found in histones and involved in histone-histone, and histone-DNA interactions (18Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11170-11174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The motifs in Dpb3p and Dpb4p are homologous in sequence to those in NF-YC and NF-YB (two small subunits of the transcription factor NF-Y; also termed CBF), respectively (16Li Y. Pursell Z.F. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23247-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The structure of the NF-YC-NF-YB solved by x-ray crystallography resembles that of the histone H2A-H2B dimer (19Romier C. Cocchiarella F. Mantovani R. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1336-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Cells bearing a mutation in POL2 or lacking DPB3 and/or DPB4 are defective in silencing, as demonstrated by examining the expression of genes placed at telomeres. The single-cell telomeric silencing assay, which monitors switching between silenced and expressed states at telomere-proximal regions of a single cell in each cell division, revealed that either maintenance or inheritance, but not establishment, of silencing is impaired in these cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying these observations is poorly understood. We have previously shown that Pol ϵ of S. cerevisiae has multiple sites at which it interacts with DNA (20Tsubota T. Maki S. Kubota H. Sugino A. Maki H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 873-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Besides stable association with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), one of these sites has a strong affinity for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), a feature not generally associated with DNA polymerases. Since a truncated polypeptide comprising the N-terminal half of Pol2p, containing the DNA polymerase and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities, binds only to ssDNA, the dsDNA-binding site must reside either in the C-terminal half of Pol2p or in the auxiliary subunits. Furthermore, simultaneous overexpression in Escherichia coli of the two non-essential subunits, Dpb3p and Dpb4p, revealed that these histone-fold motif-containing subunits form a heterodimer and associate with dsDNA. The dsDNA-binding characteristics of the Dpb3p-Dpb4p subassembly resemble those of the intact Pol ϵ with respect to their lack of dependence on specific sequence context and the presence of DNA ends. However, the affinity of Dpb3p-Dpb4p for dsDNA is extremely weak (KD in the μm range), so that attribution of the dsDNA-binding activity of Pol ϵ (KD =∼10 nm) to the Dpb3p-Dpb4p subassembly was not possible. In this study, we show that neither Pol2p-Dpb2p nor Dpb3p-Dpb4p binds stably to dsDNA, but that binding is efficiently reconstituted when the two subassemblies are combined, indicating that both complexes are required for stable association with dsDNA. Further characterization of mutant forms of Pol ϵ, having amino acid substitutions in Dpb3p, strongly suggests that the Dpb3p-Dpb4p subassembly in intact Pol ϵ binds dsDNA around its dimeric histone-fold structure in a manner resembling the histone-DNA interaction. A pair of histone-fold motif-containing proteins is known to be present in transcription regulators and chromatin remodeling complexes, such as NF-Y/CBF and CHRAC (21Corona D.F. Eberharter A.

Since the histone-fold pair in these complexes, through its ability to interact with DNA as well as with histones, plays roles in events requiring association with chromatin (25Caretti G. Motta M.C. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8591-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Kukimoto I. Elderkin S. Grimaldi M. Oelgeschlager T. Varga-Weisz P.D. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1326-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that defective silencing observed in dpb3Δ and dpb4Δ cells is due to a lack of dsDNA-binding activity by Pol ϵ in these cells. dsDNA binding by Pol ϵ is indeed required for the stable inheritance of a silenced state of chromatin at telomeres. Plasmid Constructions—We used PCR to amplify from YCplac111-DPB3 plasmid DNA a fragment containing 278 bp upstream of DPB3 and the DPB3 coding region, preceded by a SalI site and followed by a C-terminally fused recognition sequence for PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) (PP sequence), which contains a XhoI site. The SalI-XhoI fragment was inserted into the pT7Blue-2 T-vector (Novagen) to yield pT7Blue-DPB3-PP. We then amplified from YTI365 genomic DNA a fragment containing a 5FLAG sequence and a 431-bp region downstream of DPB3, preceded by the PP sequence and followed by a SacI site. The resultant fragment was digested with XhoI and SacI and inserted into pT7Blue-DPB3-PP to yield pTBlue-DPB3-PP-5FLAG, and the SalI-SacI insert from this plasmid was transferred into the YIplac211 integration vector to yield YIplac211-DPB3-PP-5FLAG. We made the plasmid YIplac211-POL2-PP-5FLAG in an analogous fashion by inserting a KpnI-SphI fragment containing a 596-bp C-terminal portion of POL2 fused to the PP-5FLAG sequence and a 420-bp region downstream of POL2. YIplac211-DPB4 was constructed by inserting a KpnI-EcoRI fragment generated by PCR amplification using pBluescript-DPB4 as a template. This fragment contains the DPB4 coding region flanked by the 788 bp immediately upstream and 25 bp downstream of the coding sequence. YCplac22-DPB4 was constructed by subcloning a BamHI-KpnI fragment containing DPB4 and its flanking sequences from pBluescript-DPB4 into the YCplac22 vector. Amino acid substitution mutations in DPB3 and DPB4 on YIplac211-DPB3-PP-5FLAG, YIplac211-DPB4, YCplac111-DPB3, and YCplac22-DPB4 were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids YIplac211, YCplac111-DPB3, YCplac22, and pBluescript-DPB4 were gifts from A. Sugino, Osaka University (28Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). Strains and Media—The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. YTI189 was transformed with SnaBI-digested YIplac211-DPB3-PP-5FLAG, and the endogenous DPB3 gene was replaced with DPB3-PP-5FLAG by two-step homologous recombination to yield YRT1. YTI189 was transformed with NaeI-digested YIplac211-POL2-PP-5FLAG, and the endogenous POL2 gene was replaced with POL2-PP-5FLAG by two-step homologous recombination to yield YRT10. A TRP1 fragment flanked by the 80 bp just upstream and downstream of DPB3 and a LEU2 fragment flanked by the 80 bp upstream and downstream of DPB4 were generated by PCR amplification using YCplac22(TRP1) and YCplac111(LEU2) as templates, respectively. To delete DPB3 and DPB4, YRT10 was transformed with these PCR fragments to replace the entire open reading frames of endogenous DPB3 and DPB4 with TRP1 and LEU2, respectively, yielding YRT13. Amino acid substitution dpb3 mutants (YTT7, YSM2, and YSM3) were constructed by transforming YRT1 with plasmid YIplac211-dpb3-PP-5FLAG carrying various amino acid substitution mutations in DPB3 and replacing the endogenous DPB3-PP-5FLAG with mutated dpb3-PP-5FLAG. YSM3, which carries the dpb3(L2 + α1) mutation, was transformed with YIplac211-dpb4(S36K/T37K) to replace endogenous DPB4 with dpb4(S36K/T37K), yielding YSM6. To delete the RAD9 gene from YTI249 and YTI250, the entire open reading frame was replaced with HIS3 by transforming the cells with an appropriate PCR fragment to yield YSM8 and YSM9, respectively. YPD (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, 2% Bacto-agar) and YPAD (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, 0.004% adenine sulfate) media were prepared as described (29Amberg D.C.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2005: 199-202Google Scholar), except that 170 mg leucine per liter and 8.5 mg para-aminobenzoic acid per liter were added.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeYTI189aGifts from H.

Open table in a new tab Affinity Purification of Pol ϵ and Pol2p-Dpb2p—Pol ϵ and Pol2p-Dpb2p were purified from YRT1 and YRT13 yeast cells, respectively. All operations were performed at 0-4 °C except where noted. Cells (200 g) were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium to late log phase (∼108 cells/ml), harvested by centrifugation, and washed once with H2O. The cells were divided into 10-g aliquots in 50-ml conical tubes, frozen immediately in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Frozen cells (10 g) were resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer H (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.005% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1x complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1% Sigma protease inhibitor (Sigma), 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm NaF, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, and 0.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate and disrupted by adding 25 g of glass beads (0.5 mm) to the suspension and homogenizing using a Multi-Beads Shocker-MB458U(S) (Yasui Kikai), which can process 30 g of cells (10 g × 3) at a time. After removal of the glass beads, the extract was cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min. The extract was mixed with 20 ml of Sepharose 4B equilibrated with Buffer H, supplemented with protease inhibitors as above, and incubated for 1 h with gentle rotation followed by two successive filtrations through JCWP04700 (10 μm) and Type HV (0.45 μm) filters (Millipore). The filtrate was loaded on an anti-FLAG antibody (M2)-conjugated agarose (Sigma) column (5 ml), equilibrated with Buffer H containing protease inhibitors, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After washing with 5 column volumes of Buffer H containing protease inhibitors and 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and then with 10 column volumes of Buffer H, bound proteins were treated in situ with PreScission protease to cleave the 5FLAG tag from Dpb3p or Pol2p, as specified by the manufacturer, and then eluted with 5 column volumes of Buffer H at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min; 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Pol ϵ subunits co-eluted in the major protein peak. The peak fractions were pooled and applied directly to a HiTrap Heparin column (1 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer P (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 300 mm NaCl. After washing with 5 column volumes of the equilibration buffer, proteins were eluted with 10 column volumes of a linear 300 mm to 1 m NaCl gradient in Buffer P at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min; 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Pol ϵ subunits co-eluted in the major protein peak at 590 mm (for Pol ϵ) or 580 mm NaCl (for Pol2p-Dpb2p). The peak fractions of Pol2p-Dpb2p contained two other polypeptides (50 and 30 kDa) in small amounts. Mass spectroscopic analysis revealed that these polypeptides are C- and N-terminal truncated polypeptides of Dpb2p, respectively. The peak fractions were aliquoted, frozen immediately in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. The purity of the samples was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be >95%. Yields of 210 and 230 μg of Pol ϵ and Pol2p-Dpb2p, respectively, were obtained from 200 g of cells. Since the subunit stoichiometry (1:1:1:1) and the Stokes radius (76.0 Å) determined for Pol ϵ were in good agreement with the numbers that appear in the previous report in which Pol ϵ was concluded to be a heterotetramer (30Chilkova O. Jonsson B.H. Johansson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14082-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we assume that Pol ϵ in our preparation is also a heterotetramer. From the subunit stoichiometry (1:1) and the Stokes radius (68.8 Å) determined for Pol2p-Dpb2p, together with the fact that Pol ϵ is a heterotetramer, it is strongly suggested that Pol2p-Dpb2p is a heterodimer. The specific DNA polymerase activities of Pol ϵ and Pol2p-Dpb2p were 23,000 and 8,000 units/mg (8.7 and 2.7 units/pmol), respectively. Mutant forms of Pol ϵ were purified from YTT7, YSM2, YSM3, and YSM6 cells according to the same procedure, except that 40 g of cells were used, and column sizes were reduced proportionally. Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtration was carried out essentially as described (20Tsubota T. Maki S. Kubota H. Sugino A. Maki H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 873-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein samples were prepared in a volume of 50 μl and filtered through a Superose 6 column (2.4 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer S (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 400 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Fractions of 30 μl were collected. Molecular masses and Stokes radii of the reference proteins were: thyroglobulin (669 kDa, 85.0 Å), ferritin (440 kDa, 61.0 Å), catalase (232 kDa, 52.2 Å), BSA (67 kDa, 35.5 Å), and ovalbumin (43 kDa, 30.5 Å). Plasmid pRT21 DNA was used to mark the void volume. Homology Modeling—A previous report that Dpb3p and Dpb4p are remote homologues of histone proteins (16Li Y. Pursell Z.F. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23247-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), H2A and H2B, respectively, were confirmed by conducting a PSI-BLAST search. Making use of these weak similarities, we built the complex structure of Dpb3p-Dpb4p-dsDNA using the chicken H2A-H2B-dsDNA complex (31Harp J.M. Hanson B.L. Timm D.E. Bunick G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1513-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code: 1eqz, chains E, F, I, and J) as a template. Because Dpb3p/Dpb4p and H2A/H2B cannot be aligned directly, as their similarities are low (8-17% sequence identities), Dpb3p/Dpb4p sequences were first aligned with NF-YC/NF-YB sequences (19Romier C. Cocchiarella F. Mantovani R. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1336-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code: 1n1j, chains B and A) by PSI-BLAST. Next, NF-YC/NF-YB structures (19Romier C. Cocchiarella F. Mantovani R. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1336-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) were aligned with those of H2A/H2B with the three-dimensional structure comparison program MATRAS (32Kawabata T. Nishikawa K. Proteins. 2000; 41: 108-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). By combining these alignments, Dpb3p/Dpb4p sequences could be aligned with H2A/H2B structures, and unaligned regions at both termini of the alignments were deleted. Using these alignments, the Dpb3p-Dpb4p complex was modeled by MODELLER version 6v2 (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 403-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Finally, dsDNA was added to the Dpb3p-Dpb4p model in the same configuration as in the H2A-H2B-dsDNA complex. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—The assay was done as described (20Tsubota T. Maki S. Kubota H. Sugino A. Maki H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 873-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DNA-binding reaction mixtures (5 μl) containing 35 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.3, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm potassium phosphate, dsDNA substrate prepared by hybridizing two 61-mer DNA oligomers (5′-fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligomer 7F + complementary oligomer 71), and either wild-type or mutant forms of Pol ϵ were incubated on ice for 10 min, mixed with 0.5 μl of loading buffer, and subjected to non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amounts of dsDNA and Pol ϵ used in the reactions were indicated in each figure. Assay for Silencing of Telomeric URA3 and ADE2—The assay was done essentially as described (6Iida T. Araki H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To assay silencing of telomeric URA3, freshly grown yeast cells (YTI249, YTI250, and YTI268) harboring various YCp plasmids were taken from SC medium depleted of appropriate amino acids and diluted to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. 5-fold serial dilutions (2 × 106 to 3.2 × 103 cells/ml) were then made, and 5-μl cell suspensions from each diluted sample were spotted onto SC-Leu (or SC-Leu-Trp) and SC-Leu 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) (or SC-Leu-Trp 5-FOA) plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 36 h. To assay silencing of telomeric ADE2, ∼100 yeast cells were spread onto SC plates depleted of appropriate amino acids, and the plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days and stored at 4 °C for 1 week before pictures were taken. DNA Polymerase Activity Assay—The assay measures incorporation of [α-32P]dTTP into acid-insoluble material using poly(dA)·oligo(dT) as a DNA template. Unit definition and assay conditions were as described (34Maki S. Hashimoto K. Ohara T. Sugino A. J. Biol.

Other Methods—SDS-PAGE was carried out with readymade NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris gels, using MOPS-SDS running buffer. Gels were stained with the Colloidal Blue staining kit (Invitrogen). When needed, protein bands were quantified using NIH Image software. During the course of purification, protein concentrations were determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). To accurately compare the activities of wild-type Pol ϵ, mutant forms of Pol ϵ, and Pol2p-Dpb2p, we determined the concentration of the final preparations by running them on the same SDS-polyacrylamide gel, measuring the intensities of the Pol2p band, and comparing these with the intensities of BSA standard bands. Reconstitution of dsDNA-binding Activity of Pol ϵ from Pol2p-Dpb2p and Dpb3p-Dpb4p Subassemblies—To identify subunits of Pol ϵ responsible for the dsDNA binding, we purified the Pol2p-Dpb2p subassembly from dpb3Δ dpb4Δ yeast cells having a 5FLAG-tagged POL2 gene at the original chromosomal location of POL2. The cell extract was loaded onto an anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose column, and the bound complex containing Pol2p was eluted by in situ cleavage of the tag with PreScission protease at the junction between the C terminus of Pol2p and the FLAG tag. Analysis of the eluted proteins by SDS-PAGE showed that the recovered fraction contained polypeptides with the molecular weights expected for Pol2p and Dpb2p in 1:1 ratio, and the two proteins were confirmed to be Pol2p and Dpb2p by immunoblotting analyses. The Pol2p-Dpb2p complex was further purified to near homogeneity by heparin-agarose column chromatography. Using Pol2p-Dpb2p and Dpb3p-Dpb4p, which was purified from an E. coli strain that simultaneously overproduces Dpb3p and Dpb4p as previously described (20Tsubota T. Maki S. Kubota H. Sugino A. Maki H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 873-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we first tried to reconstitute in vitro a four-subunit complex of Pol ϵ. Upon gel filtration of Pol ϵ (26 pmol), Pol2p-Dpb2p (26 pmol), and Dpb3p-Dpb4p (300 pmol) separately through a Superose 6 column, each complex was eluted in a single peak centered on fractions 30, 31, and 37, respectively (Fig. 1, B-D). When Pol2p-Dpb2p (26 pmol) and Dpb3p-Dpb4p (300 pmol) were mixed and loaded onto the column, Pol2p, Dpb2p, Dpb3p, and Dpb4p co-eluted at the position where native Pol ϵ eluted (Fig. 1E). The stoichiometry of the four polypeptides in SDS-PAGE profiles derived from the peak fraction of either native or reconstituted Pol ϵ was 1:1:1:1. Thus, almost all the Pol2p-Dpb2p in the mixture seemed to have formed a complex with Dpb3p-Dpb4p. The Stokes radii of Pol ϵ (both native and reconstituted), Pol2p-Dpb2p, and Dpb3p-Dpb4p were calculated to be 76.0, 68.8, and 47.1 Å, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of DNA polymerase activity in the peak fractions of either native or reconstituted Pol ϵ correlated well with the elution profiles of the four polypeptides (Fig. 1A). The amounts of DNA polymerase activity recovered in the peak fractions were also similar between the native and reconstituted Pol ϵ. These results indicate that a four-subunit complex of Pol ϵ that is structurally and functionally indistinguishable from native Pol ϵ was efficiently reconstituted from Pol2p-Dpb2p and Dpb3p-Dpb4p. It is noteworthy that the DNA polymerase activity recovered in the peak fractions of Pol2p-Dpb2p is 3-fold lower than that in the peak fractions of Pol ϵ, implying an involvement of Dpb3p-Dpb4p in the DNA polymerase activity of Pol ϵ. Next, we determined whether the dsDNA-binding activity of Pol ϵ could be reconstituted from the two subassemblies. As expected from previous data (20Tsubota T. Maki S. Kubota H. Sugino A. Maki H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 873-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a fluorescein-labeled 61-mer dsDNA oligomer (7F + 71) was shifted stoichiometrically into a slower-migrating species in a gel mobility shift assay on addition of Pol ϵ to the DNA-binding reaction (Fig. 2B, lane 1), whereas addition of an equivalent amount of Dpb3p-Dpb4p to the reactions did not show any band shift (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Only when Dpb3p-Dpb4p was added in 10-20-fold molar exce"

In this study we identified the C-terminal (C-) region upstream of the cleavage site of the VCAM1 signal peptide as most critical for inhibition of translocation by CAM741, but full sensitivity to the compound also requires residues of the hydrophobic (h-) region and the first amino acid of the VCAM1 mature domain. The murine VCAM1 signal peptide, which is less susceptible to translocation inhibition by CAM741, can be converted into a fully sensitive signal peptide by two amino acid substitutions identified as critical for compound sensitivity of the human VCAM1 signal peptide. Using cysteine substitutions of non-critical residues in the human VCAM1 signal peptide and chemical cross-linking of targeted short nascent chains we show that, in the presence of CAM741, the N- and C-terminal segments of the VCAM1 signal peptide could be cross-linked to the cytoplasmic tail of Sec61β, indicating altered positioning of the VCAM1 signal peptide relative to this translocon component. Moreover, translocation of a tag fused N-terminal to the VCAM1 signal peptide is selectively inhibited by CAM741.

SPs consist of three segments, a frequently positively charged N terminus (N-region), a central hydrophobic segment (h-region) and a more polar C-terminal part (C-region) which contains the site for SP cleavage by the signal peptidase complex (SPC). Apart from these general features, SPs display little conservation in their primary sequences (7Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G.

Once the SP emerges from the translating ribosome, it is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), which then guides the ribosome-nascent chain (NC) complex to the ER membrane via binding to the SRP receptor (SR). The ribosome-NC complex is then transferred to the Sec61 translocon, a protein conducting channel composed of the α-, β-, and γ-subunits, embedded in the ER membrane (1Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B.

The initial binding between the ribosome-NC complex and Sec61 is weak, but after a critical length of the translated NC, a tight, salt-resistant complex between ribosome-NC and Sec61 is formed (23Jungnickel B.

After formation of the tight seal between ribosome-NC and translocon, the channel opens toward the lumen of the ER, allowing the NC to translocate to the luminal side of the ER, where SP cleavage and subsequent N-glycosylation takes place. These steps are controlled by the SP, and it has been suggested that different features are responsible for interaction with the SRP, insertion into the translocon and opening of the channel toward the luminal side (14Simon S.M.

Moreover, SPs also contain information for further processing of the mature domain, such as the timing and efficiency of N-glycosylation and SP cleavage (34Rutkowski D.T. Ott C.M. Polansky J.R.

We have recently reported that the cyclopeptolide CAM741, a derivative of the natural compound Hun-7293, can selectively inhibit cotranslational translocation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), an action which is dependent on parts of the SP of VCAM1. The compound does not inhibit targeting of the VCAM1 nascent chains to the translocon, but although a salt-resistant tight complex is formed, translocation to the luminal side of the ER is prevented (35Besemer J. Harant H. Wang S. Oberhauser B. Marquardt K. Foster C.A. Schreiner E.P. de Vries J.E. Dascher-Nadel C. Lindley I.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Concurrently, Garrison et al. (36Garrison J.L. Kunkel E.J. Hegde R.S. Taunton J. Nature. 2005; 436: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported that the synthetic compound “cotransin,” which has a structure very similar to CAM741, inhibits VCAM1 translocation and demonstrated that the inhibition involves the Sec61 channel but not accessory factors, such as TRAM, TRAP, and the Sec62/63 complex. CAM741 thus represents a highly interesting novel tool to investigate molecular events during cotranslational translocation. To gain more insight into the action of the compound, we analyzed by systematic mutagenesis the specific features of the VCAM1 SP contributing to the sensitivity to CAM741. We demonstrate here that the amino acid residues within the C-region are critical for sensitivity to CAM741. In particular, the residues Ala-20 and Ala-21 upstream of the cleavage site have been identified as key residues. Together with residues of the h-region, such as Met-18, and the first amino acid residue of the mature domain Phe-25, they mediate full sensitivity to CAM741. As the compound does not prevent targeting of the VCAM1 NCs to the translocon, we studied the fate of the VCAM1 SP in the presence of CAM741 at early post-targeting stages of the translocation process. We show that CAM741 alters the positioning of the VCAM1 SP relative to the translocon component Sec61β, indicating incorrect insertion of the SP into the translocon. We further demonstrate that translocation of a tag fused N-terminal to the VCAM1 SP, is inhibited by the compound, supporting the notion that CAM741, in a selective fashion, alters the positioning of the VCAM1 SP at the translocon. Compound—CAM741 was dissolved in Me2SO and stored at –20 °C. Plasmid Constructions—The wild-type (wt) VCAM1 construct has been described (35Besemer J. Harant H. Wang S. Oberhauser B. Marquardt K. Foster C.A. Schreiner E.P. de Vries J.E. Dascher-Nadel C. Lindley I.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The SP-secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) fusion constructs were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). These encode the VCAM1 SP plus additional four amino acids of the VCAM1 mature region fused to the SEAP mature domain. The minimized version VCAM1(Δ2–10) SP lacks the amino acids 2–10 of the VCAM1 SP and also contains the four amino acids of the VCAM1 mature region, fused to the SEAP mature domain. The numbering of the amino acid residues in the trun-cated VCAM1(Δ2–10) SP-SEAP construct refers to the full-length VCAM1 SP. The SEAP fusions of the mouse VCAM1 SP plus additional four amino acid residues of the mature region, all VCAM1 SP mutants and constructs encoding fusions of the N-terminal tag to the SP were generated by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1. The truncated VCAM1 cDNA, encoding the 112 amino acid residues subcloned into pcDNA3.1, has been described (35Besemer J. Harant H. Wang S. Oberhauser B. Marquardt K. Foster C.A. Schreiner E.P. de Vries J.E. Dascher-Nadel C. Lindley I.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The truncated VCAM1 cDNA encoding 182 amino acid residues was generated by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1. The IL-6 cDNA and the construct encoding the N-terminal tag fused to the IL-6 coding region were generated by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Truncated cDNAs lacking a stop codon were generated by restriction digestion of the respective plasmid DNAs. In case of the SEAP fusion constructs, plasmids were either linearized by digestion with BstEII (encoding 146 amino acid residues SEAP mature domain) or BamHI (encoding 54 amino acid residues SEAP mature domain). Linearized plasmids were used as templates for creation of RNAs by the RiboMAX™ Large Scale RNA production System-T7 (Promega). Transient Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and passaged twice a week. For transfection, 1.5 × 104 cells were seeded per well of a 96-well plate and transfected with 0.2 μg/well plasmid DNA and 0.5 μl/well Superfect (Qiagen) and treated with increasing concentrations of CAM741. Supernatants were harvested after 24 h and analyzed for SEAP secretion using the AttoPhos reagent (Promega), and fluorescence was recorded using the SPEKTRAmax GEMINI XS (Molecular Devices). In Vitro Translocation Experiments—In vitro translation, targeting and translocation assays were performed with truncated RNAs using rabbit reticulocyte lysate, canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega), and [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), in the presence of CAM741 or Me2SO (vehicle control) in a volume of 25 μl. Targeting was performed for 30 min at 26 °C. Release of the NCs from the ribosome was induced after 10 min of targeting at 26 °C followed by treatment with 3.4 μl of 4 m potassium acetate, 2.6 μl of 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 3 μl of puromycin (36 mm) for 20 min at 26 °C. The reaction mix was then diluted with 75 μl of 250 mm sucrose, 150 mm potassium acetate, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and layered on a cushion of 100 μl of 500 mm sucrose, 500 mm potassium acetate, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. In some cases, volume was doubled. Centrifugation was performed in a Beckman TLA120 rotor or a Sorvall S100AT3 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 4 min, or for larger volumes in a Sorvall S140AT rotor at 54,000 rpm for 5 min. For proteinase K digestion, pelleted membranes were resuspended in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 200 mm sucrose, 50 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm calcium chloride, and treated with proteinase K (12.5 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. For deglycosylation, sedimented membranes were lysed with 10 μl of lysis buffer (0.05% deoxycholic acid in phosphate-buffered saline, 250 mm sodium chloride, 10 μl/ml IGE-PAL (Sigma-Aldrich)). Then 8 μl of PBS, 1 μl 500 mm EDTA, and 1 μl of 10% SDS were added, and samples heated at 95 °C for 1 min. Then, 2 μl of Triton X-100 and 3 μl of N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) were added and samples incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Chemical cross-linking was carried out as described (35Besemer J. Harant H. Wang S. Oberhauser B. Marquardt K. Foster C.A. Schreiner E.P. de Vries J.E. Dascher-Nadel C. Lindley I.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were then performed with a polyclonal Sec61β or Sec61α antiserum (Upstate). Proteins were separated on Excel Gel™ SDS 8–18% or, where indicated, high resolution Excel Gel™ SDS 12–14% gels (Amersham Biosciences) and fixed and dried gels were exposed to x-ray films. Identification of the Key Amino Acid Residues of the Human VCAM1 SP Contributing to CAM741 Sensitivity—Fusion constructs of the VCAM1 SP and the mature region of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) were used to investigate the residues of the VCAM1 SP critical for sensitivity to CAM741. Previous analysis of the VCAM1 SP showed that the amino acids 2–10 are not required for translocation and are also dispensable for the compound effect, but that the first amino acid of the VCAM1 mature domain is required for full sensitivity (35Besemer J. Harant H. Wang S. Oberhauser B. Marquardt K. Foster C.A. Schreiner E.P. de Vries J.E. Dascher-Nadel C. Lindley I.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To narrow down the residues involved in the action of CAM741, we utilized the minimized VCAM1 SP, which lacks the amino acids 2–10, but contains four additional amino acids (Phe-Lys-Ile-Glu) of the VCAM1 mature domain fused to the SEAP mature domain (VCAM1(Δ2–10) SP-SEAP). Transient transfections of HEK293 cells with this construct showed, that CAM741 inhibited SEAP release with an IC50 of 9 nm (Table 1). Mutation of amino acids within the N-terminal region or in the central hydrophobic region of VCAM1(Δ2–10) SP-SEAP in most instances had no effect on compound sensitivity. However, there was some decrease in sensitivity observed for the mutants VCAM1(Δ2–10; S12G) SP-SEAP and VCAM1(Δ2– 10; M18I) SP-SEAP, while the double mutant VCAM1(Δ2–10; W16L, M18I) SP-SEAP showed greatly reduced sensitivity to CAM741 (Table 1).TABLE 1Differential sensitivity of VCAM1 SP mutants to CAM741 Open table in a new tab We reported previously that the first amino acid (Phe-25) of the VCAM1 mature region is required for full sensitivity (35Besemer J. Harant H. Wang S. Oberhauser B. Marquardt K. Foster C.A. Schreiner E.P. de Vries J.E. Dascher-Nadel C. Lindley I.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As expected from this earlier observation, changing the second or third amino acid of the VCAM1 mature domain did not further affect sensitivity to CAM741. On the other hand, replacing Phe-25 by glycine (F25G) decreased sensitivity to the compound (Table 1). Although Phe-25 contributes to CAM741 sensitivity, the cleavage site itself could be altered without loss in sensitivity. Replacement of Ser-22 by Val (S22V), or the complete cleavage site by Val-His-Gly (S22V, Q23H, A24G), even increased sensitivity to CAM741. However, certain mutations in the C-region upstream of the cleavage site clearly reduced sensitivity to CAM741. When Ala-20 was changed to valine (A20V), sensitivity was slightly decreased, while an isoleucine in this position (A20I) further decreased sensitivity to the compound (Table 1). A clear reduction in sensitivity resulted from changes of Ala-21 into valine (A21V), which further decreased by the additional amino acid change at Met-18 (M18I, A21V). The greatest loss in sensitivity was observed when both Ala-20 and Ala-21 were changed into Val (A20V, A21V); secretion of SEAP was inhibited by CAM741 with an IC50 of 600 nm (Table 1). Transient transfections were also performed with fusion constructs of the full-length (FL) VCAM1 SP plus the four additional amino acids of the VCAM1 mature region fused to the SEAP mature domain. The sensitivity of the full-length VCAM1 SP to CAM741 was slightly lower compared with the truncated VCAM1(Δ2–10) SP-SEAP construct. In addition, the mutant VCAM1 (FL; M18I, A21V) SP-SEAP, also displayed reduced sensitivity to CAM741 comparable to the corresponding truncated construct VCAM1 (Δ2–10; M18I, A21V) SP-SEAP, confirming the importance of these residues in drug sensitivity (Table 1). These data indicate that the residues Ala-20 and Ala-21 upstream of the cleavage site together with Met-18 of the h-region, and Phe-25, the first amino acid residue of the mature domain, are required for full sensitivity to CAM741. Conversion of the Mouse VCAM1 SP into a Fully CAM741-sensitive SP by Amino Acid Substitutions Present in the Human VCAM1 SP—Inhibition of murine VCAM1 expression requires higher concentrations of CAM741 compared with human VCAM1. 3H. Harant, unpublished observations. Here we show that transient transfections of HEK293 cells with a construct containing the full-length mouse VCAM1 SP plus four additional residues of the mature domain fused to SEAP (mouse VCAM1 (FL) SP-SEAP) resulted in clearly reduced sensitivity to CAM741 (Table 1). The mouse VCAM1 SP has several amino acid residues different from the human VCAM1 SP, and contains a valine at the critical position 21 and a leucine at position 18. We therefore replaced these amino acid residues by the ones present in the human counterpart and tested these constructs for sensitivity to CAM741 by transient transfection experiments. While conversion of Leu-18 to Met (L18M) in the mouse VCAM1 SP resulted in some increase in sensitivity to CAM741, conversion of Val-21 to Ala (V21A) clearly enhanced sensitivity to the compound. However, conversion of both residues, in mouse VCAM1 (L18M, V21A) SP, yielded a construct with almost the same sensitivity to CAM741 as the full-length human VCAM1 SP. The results from this “humanized” mouse VCAM1 SP confirm the importance of these residues in determining sensitivity to CAM741 (Table 1). Differential Sensitivity of VCAM1 SP Mutants to Inhibition by CAM741 Occurs at the Level of Cotranslational Translocation—We determined whether the differential response of the VCAM1 SP mutants to CAM741 observed in the cellular assay is reflected at the level of cotranslational translocation. VCAM1 SP-SEAP fusion constructs were linearized with BstEII to create truncated RNAs lacking a stop codon. These were then used for in vitro translation in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes to generate translocation intermediates of SP + 146 amino acid residues SEAP mature domain (Fig. 1A). The SEAP mature domain contains a glycosylation site at position 122 which allows detection of translocated NCs after release from the ribosome by high salt/puromycin treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). In vitro translocation of the truncated VCAM1(Δ2–10) SP-SEAP fusion construct showed that the translocated, glycosylated fragment was protected from digestion by added protease, and degraded only after lysis of the microsomal membranes with Triton X-100. Another faster migrating fragment, which was also protected from added protease, resembles the non-glycosylated form with the SP cleaved off (Fig. 1B, left upper panel). Glycosylation was confirmed by treatment of translocated NCs with endoglycosidase F (Fig. 1B, right panel). However, in the presence of CAM741, only a single, protease-sensitive fragment was observed, demonstrating inhibition of translocation of the VCAM1(Δ2–10) SP-SEAP fusion construct by CAM741 (Fig. 1B, left upper panel). The dose-dependent effect of CAM741 on translocation of several constructs was then further analyzed. Translocation of the fusion partner SEAP, under control of its own SP, was not inhibited by CAM741 up to a concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 1C) (35Besemer J. Harant H. Wang S. Oberhauser B. Marquardt K. Foster C.A. Schreiner E.P. de Vries J.E. Dascher-Nadel C. Lindley I.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, translocation of the VCAM1(Δ2–10) SP-SEAP fusion construct was dose-dependently inhibited by CAM741. The constructs VCAM1(Δ2–10; A21V) SP-SEAP, VCAM1(Δ2–10; M18I, A21V) SP-SEAP and VCAM1(Δ2–10; A20V, A21V) SP-SEAP required higher concentrations of CAM741 for inhibition, which is in agreement with the data obtained from the transient transfection experiments (Table 1 and Fig. 1C). Moreover, the differential compound sensitivity of the full-length VCAM1 SP, the mouse VCAM1 SP and its mutations determined by transient transfection assays, could be confirmed by the in vitro translocation experiments (Table 1 and Fig. 1C). To exclude any effect of the SEAP fusion partner in the in vitro translocation experiments, we also analyzed 182 amino acid residues translocation intermediates of wt VCAM1 (Fig. 1A). As there is no glycosylation site present within this chain length, SP cleavage and protection from exogenous protease indicates correct translocation (Fig. 1B, lower panel). As shown in Fig. 1C, SP cleavage of the wt VCAM1 was inhibited by CAM741 at low concentrations, while inhibition of SP cleavage of the less sensitive mutant VCAM1 (M18I, A21V) required higher concentrations of the compound (Fig. 1C). Taken together, the differential sensitivity of the VCAM1 SP mutants to inhibition by CAM741 occurs at the level of translocation. CAM741 Alters Positioning of the VCAM1 SP Relative to the Translocon Component Sec61β—The identification of critical amino acid residues which contribute to the sensitivity to CAM741 and those which do not affect sensitivity, allowed us to replace single non-critical amino acids with cysteine residues to analyze the positioning of the VCAM1 SP within the translocon by chemical cross-linking experiments. First, we replaced amino acid residues by cysteines in the truncated VCAM1(Δ2–10) SP fused to the SEAP mature region and analyzed these SP mutants by transient transfections in HEK293 cells, to determine whether these substitutions affect translocation or sensitivity to CAM741. As outlined in Table 2, none of the single cysteine residues greatly affected sensitivity to CAM741. Second, short NCs (VCAM1(Δ2–10) SP + 54 amino acid residues SEAP mature domain) of sufficient length for targeting were created. At this chain length, the SEAP mature domain does not contain any cysteine residues, and therefore the only cysteine residue is provided by the mutated VCAM1 SP. These short NCs were used for targeting to microsomal membranes in the absence or presence of CAM741 followed by chemical cross-linking with the cysteine-reactive cross-linker bis-male-imidohexane (BMH). With several, but not all cysteine mutants formation of an enhanced cross-linked product was observed in the presence of CAM741, identified by immunoprecipitation to contain Sec61β. However, in the absence of CAM741, only weak cross-links to Sec61β were observed (Fig. 2). In particular, CAM741-induced enhanced cross-links to Sec61β were observed when amino acid residues within the N-terminal part of the minimized VCAM1(Δ2–10) SP, such as Ala-11 or Asn-13, were replaced by cysteines. In addition, upon introduction of cysteine residues instead of Ala-20 within the C-region, Ala-24 within the cleavage site, or Lys-26, the second residue of the VCAM1 mature region, enhanced cross-linking to Sec61β was observed. One exception was the cysteine substitution of Ser-22, the first residue of the cleavage site, which did not form an enhanced cross-link to Sec61β, but was sensitive to CAM741. Moreover, replacement of amino acid residues within the hydrophobic region, such as Leu-15 or Met-18, by cysteine residues, did not result in enh"
https://openalex.org/W2025223284,"A regulatory gene, designated pfsR (photosynthesis, Fe homeostasis and stress-response regulator), was discovered by a genetic screen in Synechocystis PCC 6803. Deletion of the gene from a high light-sensitive strain lacking four hli genes (4Xhli) restored viability to the parental strain under high light conditions. The quintuple mutant pfsR-/4Xhli retained photosystem-II and oxygen evolution capacity at levels similar to the wild-type levels under high light conditions. The transcripts of the two bfr genes (encoding bacterioferritin) were found to be constitutively up-regulated, whereas the transcripts of ho1 gene (encoding a heme oxygenase) were greatly down-regulated in high light upon deletion of pfsR. Under intermediate high intensity light, the pfsR deletion strains accumulated carotenoids and chlorophyll a to a significantly higher level than their corresponding parental strains. An exacerbated, transient increase in oxygen evolution during the early hours of high light acclimation and a somewhat increased steady-state level of photosystem-II-mediated oxygen evolution observed in the 4Xhli strain were brought back to the wild-type levels upon deletion of pfsR from the strain. The pfsR deletion mutants were found to be less sensitive to iron limitation under low light conditions and to suffer less lipid peroxidation following exposure to high light. Therefore, inactivation of PfsR resulted in tighter control of iron availability, which in turn reduced oxidative stress during photosynthesis in high light. These studies have revealed a critical role of PfsR in regulation of iron homeostasis and stress response. A regulatory gene, designated pfsR (photosynthesis, Fe homeostasis and stress-response regulator), was discovered by a genetic screen in Synechocystis PCC 6803.

These studies have revealed a critical role of PfsR in regulation of iron homeostasis and stress response. Photosynthetic organisms adjust their photosynthetic activity to balance the light absorption with the energetic and growth requirements of the cells. This coordination reduces the formation of potentially damaging reactive oxygen that could be massively generated by overexcitation of pigment molecules. Reactive oxygen could react with proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, ultimately causing a loss of cell viability (1Asada K. Foyer C.H. Mullineaux P.

The sequestration of free iron, which has been recognized in non-photosynthetic organisms as an antioxidant strategy (24Cozzi A. Santambrogio P. Levi S. Arosio P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Wai S.N. Nakayama K. Umene K. Moriya T. Amako K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), could very likely be a vital photo-acclimation strategy in photosynthetic organisms. The photosynthetic complexes, PS-I, PS-II, and cytochrome b6 f complexes all contain iron atoms in the forms of heme, nonheme iron, and/or iron-sulfur clusters (26Keren N. Aurora R. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1666-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is expected that damages to photosynthetic complexes under stress conditions would result in significant release of iron (II) from these complexes. Ferrous iron could catalyze the Fenton reaction, converting hydroperoxides to highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine,3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York1999: 1-104Google Scholar, 27Abdul-Tehrani H. Hudson A.J. Chang Y.S. Timms A.R. Hawkins C. Williams J.M. Harrison P.M. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, control of iron flux or iron homeostasis would be of vital importance for photosynthetic organisms to acclimate to high light (HL) and other stress conditions. Synthesis of stress-associated proteins also occurs when photosynthetic organisms are exposed to HL. These proteins are often important for the acclimation of cells to HL. The hli genes (also called scp genes) (28Dolganov N.A. Bhaya D. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 29Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), encoding the high light inducible polypeptides (HLIP) with similarity to the light harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins of plants, were shown to be important for the survival of cyanobacteria under high light conditions (30He Q. Dolganov N. Bjorkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). On the Synechocystis PCC 6803 genome, there are four hli genes encoding HLIPs. A fifth similar gene sequence is fused to the hemH gene (or scpA) to encode the C terminus of the ferrochelatase (29Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30He Q. Dolganov N. Bjorkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The levels of the four HLIPs increase in response to HL, low temperature, and nutrient limitation (30He Q. Dolganov N. Bjorkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), whereas the levels of the ferrochelatase are reduced under these conditions. 3Q. He, personal observation. In addition, the HLIP-like extension of the ferrochelatase did not functionally complement HLIPs under HL conditions, and the mutant (4Xhli) lacking all four hli genes (hliA-D) dies in HL, whereas any of the triple mutants survives under the same conditions (30He Q. Dolganov N. Bjorkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the regulation of hli genes is different from that of the hemH gene and support that HliA-D and the ferrochelatase might perform rather distinct functions (29Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), at least in HL. The functions of HLIPs so far are unclear. However, they are likely to perform multiple functions (even though these polypeptides could functionally complement each other) because hli genes in Synechocystis PCC 6803 were found to be differentially expressed in the cells and distinctively localized in fast protein liquid chromatography (30He Q. Dolganov N. Bjorkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, groups of hli genes in the HL-adapted Prochlorococcus strain MED4 are found to be differentially expressed under phosphorus starvation or HL stress, suggesting that groups of hli genes contribute to specific stress responses (31Coleman M.L. Sullivan M.B. Martiny A.C. Steglich C. Barry K. Delong E.F. Chisholm S.W. Science. 2006; 311: 1768-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). HLIPs may enable cyanobacteria to cope with the production of reactive oxygen species, possibly by regulating tetrapyrrole biosynthesis as a function of the demand for chlorophyll (32Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or by promoting the dissipation of the excess light energy absorbed (34Havaux M. Guedeney G. He Q. Grossman A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1557: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a suppressor screen (35St Johnston D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), in an attempt to elucidate the functions of HLIPs and the mechanisms of HL survival. The genetic screen has resulted in the discovery of the regulatory gene pfsR (photosynthesis, Fe homeostasis and stress response regulator), corresponding to the open reading frame sll1392 in Synechocystis PCC 6803. The pfsR gene was inactivated from the wild-type and 4Xhli strain, generating the homoplasmic pfsR deletion strains, the pfsR- and pfsR-/4Xhli, respectively. Our results on the characterization of these mutants demonstrated that inactivation of PfsR suppresses the lethality of HL to the 4Xhli mutant and has revealed a critical role of PfsR in regulation of stress responses and iron homeostasis. Culture Growth Conditions and Light and Iron Treatments—Synechocystis PCC 6803 strain was cultivated in BG-11 medium with 10 mm TES, pH 8.2, at 30 °C. The culture was bubbled with air under LL (50 μmol photon m-2 s-1) or intermediate HL (300 μmol photon m-2 s-1) or HL (500 μmol photon m-2 s-1) conditions. Photon flux densities were measured with LI-250 Quantum-meter (LI-COR Biosciences). For HL or intermediate HL experiments, the cells reaching mid-logarithmic growth phase (OD730 ∼0.6) were diluted to OD730 ∼0.1 and exposed to light at 300 μmol photon m-2 s-1 or higher for various lengths of time as indicated. The cultures in glass tubes were placed in a thermo-stated glass chamber filled with water at 30 °C. For testing the sensitivity of iron, cells were diluted to an OD730 of ∼0.2 and continued to grow in three different iron conditions. The low iron medium used was BG-11 medium without supplement of ferric ammonium citrate, and the medium was treated with 50 μm dipyridyl, an iron chelator. Normal and high iron medium were BG-11 medium supplemented with 30 μm and 300 μm ferric ammonium citrate, respectively. The growth curve was determined by measuring OD730. Mutagenesis and Screening for Suppressors—The parental strain for mutagenesis was the Synechocystis PCC 6803 4Xhli strain (30He Q. Dolganov N. Bjorkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The strain lacks four HLIPs and dies upon exposure to HL. This permits screening of suppressors, mutants with secondary mutations that counteract the effects of the primary mutations (inactivation of hli genes), by isolation of survivor colonies in HL. The 4Xhli was mutagenized with N-methyl-N′-nitrosoguanidine (36Dolganov N. Grossman A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 610-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of mutagenized cells were spread onto BG-11 plates containing appropriate antibiotics and incubated at 20 μmol photon m-2 s-1 for 3 days. The plates were then exposed to HL for 48 h to bleach cells before being returned to LL. Colonies of survivors typically appeared within 10 days. These putative suppressors were re-tested for HL tolerance. A total of six stable suppressors, named “pfs1-6” (the naming reflects our wishes to isolate mutants involve in photosynthesis, Fe homeostasis and stress responses), were obtained. These suppressors grow well in LL with growth rates that are not significantly different from that of the wild type. A single mutant, designated pfs1, was successfully complemented (see below). Complementation of the pfs1 Mutant—Molecular techniques were performed using standard protocols (37Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). To identify the point mutations in the pfs1 suppressor, genomic DNA was isolated from pfs1 and mechanically sheared to ∼4-7-kb fragments by agitation in the presence of 0.1-mm glass beads. The DNA fragments were then cloned in pGEM-T vector after the ends were fixed by TaqDNA polymerase, according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega). The genomic DNA library was transformed into the 4Xhli mutant, and transformants were selected for ampicillin resistance, which results when a plasmid integrates into the chromosome by single homologous recombination. Several complements that tolerate HL exposure were obtained. Two colonies were randomly selected for chromosomal DNA extraction. The genomic regions flanking the inserted plasmid DNA, which delimits the putative complementing fragments, were determined by direct sequencing using the universal forward and reverse primers that bind at the multiple cloning site of pGEM-T, as previously reported (38Bhaya D. Takahashi A. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7540-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). DNA Manipulation and Mutant Construction—The plasmid in which the pfsR gene (sll1392) was inactivated was generated by ligating a 420-bp fragment of pfsR gene (from start codon to 420 bp into the gene), a ∼1.5 kb erythromycin-resistant cartridge, and a 426-bp PCR fragment generated to sequences downstream of pfsR gene (113 to 539-bp downstream of the stop codon), all in proper orientation. The primers used to amplify the pfsR gene fragment are: 5′-ATGTTAAATCCATCCACCATG-3′ and 5′-TCtaGACCCATGGAGCAAACCAAAGC-3′; the two lowercase letters indicate insertions added for creation of a XbaI site. The primers used to amplify the pfsR downstream sequences are 5′-CCAGGGGAATTCTCCTCCAGT-3′ and 5′-TAGg(A)GCc(G)CCATAATAATGACCCC-3′. The lowercase letters in the latter primer indicate mutations introduced for creation of an ApaI restriction site. The original nucleotides are included in parentheses to the left of the corresponding mutations. The resulting plasmid, pPFSR-Ery, carries a 294-bp deletion (182-bp pfsR coding sequences plus 112-bp downstream sequences). The pPFSR-Ery plasmid was used to transform the Synechocystis PCC 6803 wild type and the 4Xhli strain with an eryr cassette recycled by the method reported (32Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected by screening for resistance to 10 μg of erythromycin/ml in BG-11 medium. Transformants were restreaked onto the same medium and segregation of the inactivated pfsR gene was monitored by PCR using genomic DNA of transformants and the two inner primers 5′-CCAAACGAAAGTTCAACCCCTAGA-3′ and 5′-ATAGAGGCTCCTGATAGCGGTTTTT-3′ that recognize sequences upstream or downstream of the inserted eryr cassette. The fragment sizes of pfsR and pfsR-eryr loci amplified are 600 bp and 1.75 kb, respectively. Homoplasmic mutants were obtained, and the mutants generated by transformation of wild type and 4Xhli were designated as pfsR- and pfsR-/4Xhli, respectively. For PCR analysis, Synechocystis PCC 6803 genomic DNA was prepared by a mini preparation procedure. Briefly, a loopful of cyanobacterial cells was suspended in 200 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube with 200 μl of glass beads (0.1-mm diameter; Sigma). The cells were broken in a MiniBead Beater (Biospec Products) by two cycles of agitation at the low speed setting for 30 s; between each cycle, the cells were cooled on ice for 2-3 min. Lysates were extracted with phenol-chloroform, and the DNA was precipitated, washed, and dried according to standard procedures (37Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). The dry DNA pellet was dissolved in 40 μl of H2O of which 1 μl was used for each PCR. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot—RNA was isolated from cells as previously described (39He Q. Vermaas W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For RNA blot hybridizations, 3 μg of total RNAs was separated by 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred onto Immobilon NY+ nylon membrane (Millipore). Ethidium bromide was included in the loading buffer, allowing for visualization of the rRNA bands and confirmation of equal loading of RNA samples after transfer. The gene-specific probes for hybridization were prepared by PCR as reported (40Hsiao H.Y. He Q. Van Waasbergen L.G. Grossman A.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3882-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The gene-specific fragments/probes were labeled with biotin using NEBlot Phototope kit (New England Biolabs), and the hybridization was detected by chemiluminescence using CDP-Star kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oxygen Evolution and Fluorescence Measurements—Cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The cells were then resuspended to the concentration of 5 μg of chlorophyll per ml. O2 evolution was measured using a Clark-type electrode and illuminated with white light at 1000 μmol of photon m-2 s-1. Cultures were supplemented with 1 mm sodium bicarbonate for the determination of whole chain photosynthetic electron transport activities. PS-II-mediated electron transport activities were measured in the presence of 0.5 mm 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone and 1 mm K3FeCN6 (41Meetam M. Keren N. Ohad I. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed on a dual-modulation kinetic fluorometer (Model FL-3000, Photon Systems Instruments). Cultures (2 μg of chlorophyll/ml) were dark incubated for 10 min in the presence of 0.3 mm phenyl-p-benzoquinone and followed by a 1-min incubation in the presence of 40 μm DCMU (42Chu H.A. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6137-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Relative PS-II content was determined as (Fmax - Fo)/Fo (41Meetam M. Keren N. Ohad I. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lipid Peroxidation Assessment—Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenals (HAE), the decomposed products of polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxides. MDA and HAE were quantified using the BIOXYTECH® LPO-586™ kit (OXIS International Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This assay is based on the reaction of a chromogenic reagent N-methyl-2-phenylindole with MDA and HAE at 45 °C to yield a stable chromophore with maximal absorbance at 586 nm. Western Blot Analysis—Thylakoid membranes were prepared according to the method reported (39He Q. Vermaas W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Solubilization of thylakoid membranes and SDS-PAGE were performed as described by Peter and Thornber (43Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of membrane proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 16% polyacrylamide with 6 m urea. Polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and immunodetection of polypeptides was performed using commercial antibodies, as recommended by the suppliers of the antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; AgriSera). Pigment Analysis—Cellular pigments were extracted in 90% methanol for qualitative analysis. For quantitative determination of the pigment content of cells, pigments were extracted in dimethylformamide. After centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was taken to quantify the pigment content photometrically. The concentration of total colored carotenoids ([Carotenoid]) in a DMF extract was determined by the formula in Equation 1 (44Chamovitz D. Sandmann G. Hirschberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17348-17353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [Carotenoid](μg/ml)=(A461-0.046×OD664)×4 The chlorophyll a concentration ([Chlorophyll a]) was measured from the DMF extract by the formula in Equation 2 (45Moran R. Plant Physiol. 1982; 69: 1376-1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [Chlorophylla](μg/ml)=12.1×OD664-0.17×OD625 Statistics—The experiments reported here were carried out independently at least three times on different days. In experimental groups that were statistically analyzed for differences, Student's t test was used, in which p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant. The numerical data are expressed as means ± S.D. Identification of the Suppressor Mutation in the Suppressor pfs1—To identify the suppressor mutation in pfs1, the 4Xhli mutant was transformed with a recombinant genomic library of pfs1, and transformants were screened for complementation of the defect in HL tolerance as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two complements (HL tolerant colonies) were randomly selected and propagated for direct genomic DNA sequencing using the universal forward and reverse primers. The sequence data revealed that the two overlapping genomic fragments from pfs1 were integrated into the genome of the two HL tolerant colonies, respectively. The overlap is a 4.6-kb fragment and contains three and a half open reading frames (ORF) (Fig. 1). The three complete ORFs (sll1392-1394) and the fourth partial ORF (sll1395) are in the same direction. sll1392 encodes a hypothetical transcription factor, while the other three sll1393 (glgA), sll1394 (msrA), and sll1395 (rfbD) encode a glycogen (starch) synthase, a peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (involved in repair of oxidatively damaged proteins) and a dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase (involved in cell envelope or wall synthesis), respectively. We then amplified and cloned each of these four individual ORF with flanking sequences from pfs1 and used clones in complementation analysis to define the complementing gene. An 830-bp fragment covering the entire 609-bp sll1392, found to be responsible for the complementation, was sequenced. The mutations were found to be a G to A transition that resulted in changing of the Glu-111 (codon GAA) of the deduced Sll1392 protein into a Lys (codon AAA). We termed sll1392 as pfsR (photosynthesis, Fe homeostasis and stress response regulator). Analysis of the deduced PfsR protein sequence showed that it shares sequence similarity with the super-family of TetR regulators (28-33% identity). It is presented in all other cyanobacterial genomes that have been sequenced. The PfsR protein contains a DNA-binding helixturn-helix (HTH) motif. A large portion of the protein (from Tyr-37 to Tyr-135) shows high degrees of similarity (28% identities, 41% positives) with the C-terminal portion of the LRR (leucine-rich repeats) domain of the Arabidopsis COI1 protein, a key negative regulator of the jasmonate signaling network (46Xie D.X. Feys B.F. James S. Nieto-Rostro M. Turner J.G. Science. 1998; 280: 1091-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Characteristics of pfsR- Mutants in High Light—The pfsR gene was inactivated from the wild type and 4Xhli by targeted mutagenesis, and homoplasmic mutants were obtained (Fig. 2). Table 1 summarizes some of the characteristics of these mutants. Clearly, upon deletion of pfsR from 4Xhli, the quintuple mutant was capable of growth in HL. The growth rate of the quintuple mutant was similar to that of the pfsR- single mutant and was not much different from that of wild type in both LL and HL. The loss of oxygen evolution capability seen in the 4Xhli mutant in HL was alleviated. These results demonstrated that pfsR deletion suppressed the lethality of the 4Xhli mutant in HL. To investigate whether pfsR deletion helped to reduce oxidative stress, we estimated lipid peroxidation, a commonly accepted indicator of oxidative stress, in LL-grown or HL-treated cells by measuring the content of MDA and HAE. The results are shown in Table 2. The MDA+HAE levels are similar for all four strains in LL. Upon exposure of cells to HL for 36 h, we found that MDA+HAE levels increased by about 50% for the wild-type and pfsR- strains. In contrast, the lipid peroxidation level (as evaluated by measurement of MDA+HAE) was tripled in the 4Xhli strain as compared with low light level. This implies that the 4Xhli mutant suffered extensive membrane damage under very high intensity light (500 μmol photon m-2 s-1), which could be the major reason for its HL sensitivity. The level of lipid peroxidation in 4Xhli is about twice as much as that in the quintuple mutant in HL. This indicates that the aggravated oxidative damage to 4Xhli cells in HL has been essentially as"
https://openalex.org/W2088720250,"Multidrug resistance is a serious problem in successful cancer chemotherapy. Studies using model cell lines have demonstrated that overexpression of some members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, such as ABCC1, causes enhanced efflux and, thus, decreased accumulation of multiple anticancer drugs, which leads to increased cell survival. Unlike most other ABC transporters, ABCC1 has an additional membrane-spanning domain (MSD0) with a putative extracellular amino terminus of 32 amino acids. However, the function of MSD0 and the role of the extracellular amino terminus are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the structural folding and the function of the amino terminus. We found that it has a U-shaped folding with the bottom of the U-structure facing cytoplasm and both ends in extracellular space. We also found that this U-shaped amino terminus probably functions as a gate to regulate the drug transport activity of human ABCC1.

The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 3The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; MSD, membrane-spanning domain; HA, hemagglutinin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; WT, wild type. membrane transporter superfamily comprises over 1000 members from bacteria to humans, with a wide variety of substrate specificity and function (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar, 2Dean M. Annilo T. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2005; 6: 123-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The activity of ABC transporters appear to be dependent on ATP binding and hydrolysis. In humans, 49 ABC transporters are known (for a complete list, see, on the World Wide Web, nutrigene.4t.com/humanabc.htm), and some of them (e.g. ABCB1 or Pgp, ABCC1 or MRP1, ABCG2 or BCRP) have been associated with multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy (3Ling V.

Overexpression of ABCB1, ABCC1, or ABCG2 alone in cancer cells causes increased drug efflux, which results in decreased cellular accumulation of anticancer drugs, and thus the cells can survive drug treatment. Unlike most of the known ABC transporters, ABCC1 has an additional membrane-spanning domain (MSD) at its amino terminus with a domain arrangement of MSD0-MSD1-NBD1-MSD2-NBD2 (8Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar, 9Kruh G.D. Belinsky M.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7537-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The additional MSD0 consists of five putative transmembrane segments with a predicted extracellular amino terminus (Fig. 1). The functional relevance of the MSD0 to the transporter remains elusive. Although it has been shown that deletion of MSD0 (as little as 66 amino acids from the amino terminus, including the first transmembrane segment) reduced 90% of the LTC4 transport activity of human ABCC1 (10Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3286-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the MSD0 may play roles in processing and trafficking of human ABCC1 (13Bakos E. Evers R.

J. 2000; 348: 597-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this prevailing topological orientation of the amino terminus has recently been challenged by a study using a monoclonal antibody (IU2H10) against the amino terminus of human ABCC1, which suggested that part of the amino terminus was exposed intracellularly (21Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To further investigate the exact topological orientation and function of the amino terminus of human ABCC1, we created another monoclonal antibody, IU5C1, and several constructs with HA and FLAG epitope tags at the amino terminus. We found surprisingly that the amino terminus of human ABCC1 has a U-shaped folding with the bottom of the U structure exposed to intracellular space and that this U-shaped structure plays a gating role for the drug transport function of human ABCC1 by plugging into a putative channel. Materials—Adriamycin, vinblastine, colchicine, VP-16, anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, and peroxidase- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Sigma. Lipofectamine and G418 were purchased from Invitrogen. ECL reagent and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Bio-Rad, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies QCRL-1 and MRPr1 were obtained from Kamiya, whereas the monoclonal anti-HA antibody was from Covance. Synthetic peptides were commercially synthesized by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. All other chemicals were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher. Engineering of Tagged ABCC1 Constructs—To engineer ABCC11FLAG2, amplification of the template construct Yep-FLAG-MRP1-His (22Lee S.H. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 357-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed with primers 5′-GGCTAGCCCACCGGCATGGACTACAAGGACG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAACTCTCTTTCGGCTG-3′ (reverse). The product was cloned into pCR®-Blunt (Invitrogen), and the fragment encoding the amino terminus was released by digestion with NheI and BamHI and used to replace the wild type sequence in the ABCC1WT construct (21Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For insertion of HA tag (YPYDVPDYAS) at different positions of the amino terminus of human ABCC1, two sequential PCRs were conducted. First, a cDNA cassette (-8to +867) encoding the amino-terminal 281 amino acids of human ABCC1 was amplified using Pfu polymerase with primers 5′-GGCTAGCCCACCGGCATGGCGCTC and 5′-GGAACTCTCTTTCGGCTG, and the product was cloned into pCR®-Blunt (Invitrogen). This fragment contains a NheI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end. Next, site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene) was used to insert the HA tag with the following primers: for ABCC14HA5, 5′-GGCATGGCGCTCCGGTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGATTATGCCTCAGGCTTCTGCAGCGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCGCTGCAGAAGCCTGAGGCATAATCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTACCGGAGCGCCATGCC-3′ (reverse); for ABCC115HA16, 5′-GGCTCCGACCCGCTCTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGATTATGCCTCATGGGACTGGAATGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACATTCCAGTCCCATGAGGCATAATCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTAGAGCGGGTCGGAGCC-3′ (reverse); for ABCC130HA31, 5′-CAACCCCGACTTCACCTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGATTATGCCTCAAAGTGCTTTCAGAAC (forward) and 5′-GTTCTGAAAGCACTTTGAGGCATAATCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTAGGTGAAGTCGGGGTTG-3′ (reverse). These constructs carrying the mutations were then digested with NheI and BamHI, and the released fragments with inserted tags were used to replace the wild type sequence in the full-length ABCC1 cDNA in pcDNA3.1(+). The final plasmids carrying tagged ABCC1 were named ABCC14HA5, ABCC115HA16, and ABCC130HA31. To mutate the two N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn19® Gln and Asn23® Gln) at the amino terminus, the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used with primers 5′-CCGCTCTGGGACTGGCAAGTCACGTGGCAAACCAGCAACCCCGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCGGGGTTGCTGGTTTGCCACGTGATTGCCAGTCCCAGAGCGG-3′ (reverse). The final mutant ABCC1 construct was named ABCC1QQ. ABCC1ΔN32 (with deletion of the first 32 amino acids) was engineered by amplifying a 1209-bp fragment of ABCC1 using a forward primer carrying a NheI site and a Kozak translation initiation sequence 5′-CTAGCTAGCGCCGCCATGTTTCAGAACACGGTC-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-CACAGACATGAGGTTGAC-3′. The PCR products were then digested with NheI and BamHI to generate a 762-bp fragment, which was subsequently subcloned into ABCC1WT digested with NheI and BamHI, resulting in ABCC1ΔN32. All of the above mutant constructs were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. Generation of Monoclonal Antibody IU5C1—Generation of hybridoma-producing anti-ABCC1 antibodies was performed as described previously (21Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The hybridoma-producing monoclonal antibody IU5C1 was collected and further characterized in the same way as described previously for IU2H10 (21Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transfection and Selection of HEK293 Stable Clones—HEK293 cells were plated and grown to subconfluence. 5 μg of each construct encoding the wild type and mutant human ABCC1 was transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine Plus as previously described (21Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 2 days after transfection, cells were split, and 1% of the cells were used for selection with G418 (800 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. The G418-resistant clones were picked and then expanded for further analysis of ABCC1 expression using Western blot and FACS. These clones were maintained in medium containing G418 at a concentration of 200 μg/ml for further studies. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay, Western Blot, Confocal Imaging, and FACS Analyses—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, confocal imaging, and FACS analyses were performed exactly as previously described (21Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For peptide inhibition, different concentrations of various peptides were mixed with the primary antibody and incubated for 1 h at room temperature prior to probing the blot or saponin-permeabilized cells. For FACS analysis in the presence of vanadate, cells were aliquoted into a microtiter plate at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/well. The cells were then incubated with Adriamycin in the presence of sodium vanadate at 37 °C for 1 h. The incubation medium was then removed by centrifugation, and the cells were stained with the standard protocol as described above. Statistical Analyses—All protein activity data (log-transformed EC50) were fitted into a linear mixed model, in which the correlation among paired data were modeled. All p values were calculated based on this mixed model, and p values less than 5% were considered significant. The advantage of this approach is to allow different experiments to share the same variance information. Model diagnosis was also performed, and it appeared that equal variance and normal assumptions worked well in our data set after the EC50 values were log-transformed. The analysis was conducted in SAS, PROC MIXED (available on the World Wide Web at www.sas.com/). Characterization and Epitope Mapping of the Monoclonal Antibodies IU5C1 and IU2H10—The monoclonal antibody IU2H10 has been characterized, and its epitope has been mapped to 10 amino acids (8SADGSDPLWD17) in the amino terminus of human ABCC1 (21Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). During our screening of monoclonal antibodies raised against the amino terminus of human ABCC1, we found another clone, IU5C1 of the IgG1 subtype. As shown by both Western blot analysis of membranes isolated from human ABCC1-transfected HEK293 or drug-selected MCF7 cells and confocal immunofluorescence analysis of ABCC1-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B), IU5C1 reacted specifically with human ABCC1 similarly as IU2H10 with the exception that IU5C1 had a lower titer than IU2H10. To determine whether IU5C1 has a different epitope from IU2H10 in the amino terminus of human ABCC1, we first employed the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine if the epitope of IU5C1 is located in the amino-terminal 19 amino acids. As shown in Fig. 1C, IU5C1 reacted with the synthetic peptides of 19 amino acids as well as with the recombinant peptide immunogen of 33 amino acids representing the amino terminus of human ABCC1. It also reacted with the synthetic peptides of 10 amino acids (8SADGSDPLWD17) (data not shown). Thus, the epitope of IU5C1 is probably located within these 10 amino acids of human ABCC1, the same as IU2H10 (21Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To further map the IU5C1 and IU2H10 epitope, we performed a peptide walking experiment using a series of synthetic peptides of six amino acids each (Fig. 1E). These peptides were then tested for their ability to block the reaction of IU5C1 and IU2H10 to human ABCC1 on Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1D, IU2H10 activity was blocked by peptide 6 (12SDPLWD17), whereas IU5C1 activity was blocked by peptide 8 (14PLWDWN19) in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, probably the epitopes for IU2H10 and IU5C1 are 12SDPLWD17(peptide 6) and 14PLWDWN19 (peptide 8), respectively, and their epitopes overlap with a shift of 2 amino acids. Membrane Orientation of the IU5C1 Epitope—Previously, we have shown that the monoclonal antibody IU2H10 can stain ABCC1 only in permeabilized cells, suggesting that its epitope in the amino terminus is located intracellularly (21Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), creating a controversial issue regarding the membrane orientation of the amino terminus of human ABCC1. To determine if the results were not due to the use of the specific antibody IU2H10, we performed a similar study using IU5C1. As shown in Fig. 2A, IU5C1 stained ABCC1-expressing cells only when the cells were permeabilized by saponin or by Triton X-100, similar to that stained by IU2H10 shown previously (21Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Live cells and cells transfected with vector alone were not stained by IU5C1. In addition, the IU5C1 staining of ABCC1-expressing cells under permeabilized conditions was completely blocked by the peptide 8 but not by peptide 7 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the IU5C1 staining was specific to human ABCC1. Thus, the IU5C1 epitope in the amino terminus of human ABCC1 is probably also located intracellularly. The U-shaped Folding of the Amino Terminus of Human ABCC1—Previously, it has been found that an HA tag engineered following the Arg4 residue (18Kast C. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26479-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and a FLAG tag engineered following Asn23 with mutations of glycosylation sites (19Muller M. Yong M. Peng X.H. Petre B. Arora S. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10123-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) at the amino terminus were both found outside of cells. These observations, together with our findings on the relative membrane orientation of IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes, raised a possibility that the amino terminus of human ABCC1 may have a U-shaped folding with the bottom of the U (IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes) located intracellularly and the two ends (tags) located extracellularly. To test this possibility, we first engineered a series of constructs with HA (YPYDVPDYAS) or FLAG tags (DYKDDDDK) inserted at different positions in the amino terminus of human ABCC1 (ABCC11FLAG2, ABCC115HA16, and ABCC130HA31) (Fig. 3A) in addition to the HA- and FLAG-tagged constructs (ABCC14HA5 and ABCC1FLAG-Q) published elsewhere (18Kast C. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26479-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Muller M. Yong M. Peng X.H. Petre B. Arora S. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10123-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells, and stable clones with similar expression levels of ABCC1 were selected for further characterization. All newly tagged ABCC1 constructs were well expressed, as shown by Western blot analyses of isolated membranes (Fig. 3, B and C), and all ABCC1 appeared to traffic normally onto plasma membranes as determined by immunofluorescence analysis of permeabilized cells (Fig. 3D). It is noteworthy that both ABCC1FLAG-Q and ABCC1QQ have a smaller size than others on the Western blot (Fig. 3B) due to a lack of glycosylations in the amino terminus. We next studied the staining pattern of the tagged ABCC1 in live and permeabilized cells using FACS analyses of different antibodies (Fig. 4). The wild type untagged ABCC1 (ABCC1WT) was stained by IU2H10 and IU5C1 only under permeabilized conditions (Fig. 4, compare A with B). Neither HA nor FLAG antibody stained the cells expressing ABCC1WT (Fig. 4C). ABCC1 with the FLAG tag inserted between Met1 and Ala2 (ABCC11FLAG2) was stained by FLAG antibody under both live (Fig. 4D) and permeabilized conditions (Fig. 4F), suggesting that the amino-terminal end of the amino terminus of human ABCC1 is exposed to the extracellular space. ABCC1 with the HA tag inserted between Arg4 and Gly5 (ABCC14HA5) was also stained by HA antibody in live cells (Fig. 4G), suggesting that the HA tag between Arg4 and Gly5 is exposed extracellularly. Similar to that in ABCC1WT, the IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes in both ABCC11FLAG2 and ABCC14HA5 were detected only following cellular permeabilization (Fig. 4, E and H), suggesting that these original epitopes in both ABCC11FLAG2 and ABCC14HA5 are located intracellularly as ABCC1WT. It is interesting to note, however, that the HA staining of ABCC14HA5 in the live cells was less than that in the saponin-permeabilized cells (Fig. 4, compare G with I). The reduced live staining of HA tag in ABCC14HA5 occurs probably because the HA tag is too close to the lipid bilayer and cannot be stained effectively by the HA antibody. Saponin is a plant glycoside consisting of a steroid or a triterpene attached to a carbohydrate chain. It may change the membrane lipid fluidity in addition to its ability to permeabilize cells. Treatment with saponin may have helped expose the epitope by changing the membrane fluidity because of its closeness to the lipid bilayer. If this is the case, staining of ABCC14HA5 at 37 °C, which also increases membrane lipid fluidity, may be increased compared with staining at 4 °C. Indeed, the HA staining of ABCC14HA5 at 37 °C was increased to a level similar to that in the saponin-treated cells (data not shown). Thus, the membrane fluidity affects the staining of HA tags in ABCC14HA5. On the other hand, the IU2H10 epitope cannot be stained at 37 °C (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that the inaccessibility of the IU2H10 epitope was due to the lipid fluidity. Insertion of the HA tag between Leu15 and Trp16 (ABCC115HA16) disrupts the IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 4K, no IU2H10 or IU5C1 staining of the ABCC115HA16-expressing cells under either live or permeabilized conditions were observed, consistent with the disruption of their epitopes by the tag insertion. Interestingly, the staining of ABCC115HA16 by HA antibody was observed only under permeabilized conditions (Fig. 4, compare J and L). This observation confirms that the central portion of the amino terminus of human ABCC1, where the IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes are situated, is located intracellularly. Previously, it has been observed that the FLAG epitope inserted between Asn23 and Thr24 with mutations of Asn19 and Asn23 in the amino terminus to Gln residues (ABCC1FLAG-Q) was detected extracellularly by the FLAG antibody (19Muller M. Yong M. Peng X.H. Petre B. Arora S. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10123-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that the amino terminus of human ABCC1 is exposed to the extracellular space. It is of interest to determine the relative membrane location of the IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes in ABCC1FLAG-Q. As shown in Fig. 4M, both IU2H10 and IU5C1 can stain live cells expressing the ABCC1FLAG-Q mutant, suggesting that the IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes in the mutant ABCC1FLAG-Q are located extracellularly. This finding is intriguing, because the central portion containing the IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes in the amino terminus of human ABCC1FLAG-Q was apparently relocated to the extracellular space by the insertion of FLAG tag at the carboxyl side of the IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes. To determine whether this relocation was due to the elimination of the two glycosylation sites at the amino terminus of ABCC1FLAG-Q, we engineered another construct (ABCC1QQ) with mutations of the two glycosylation sites (Asn19® Gln and Asn23® Gln) at the amino terminus without insertion of any tags. Staining of the cells expressing ABCC1QQ by IU2H10 and IU5C1 occurred only when the cells were permeabilized (Fig. 4, compare S and T). Thus, mutation of the glycosylation sites in the amino terminus did not cause the relocalization of the IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes in human ABCC1. It appears that the tag insertion at the carboxyl-terminal side, but not the amino-terminal side, of the IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes causes the relocalization of these epitopes. This difference may be due to the fact that the carboxyl-terminal end is inflexible by attaching to the first TM segment anchored in the membranes. To further test this possibility, we engineered another construct by inserting an HA tag between Thr30 and Lys31 IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes could be detected in live cells expressing ABCC130HA31, suggesting that the IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes of ABCC130HA31 are located extracellularly and confirming that the tag insertion at the carboxyl side of IU2H10 and IU5C1 epitopes relocates these epitopes. Interestingly, the HA tag in the ABCC130HA31 could not be detected by HA antibodies in live cells (Fig. 4P). This observation is probably due to the fact that the HA tag inserted following Thr30 is too close to membranes, which creates steric hindrance. However, a weak staining was observed when the cells were treated with saponin (Fig. 4R), suggesting that the staining of the tag may be enhanced by increasing the membrane lipid fluidity as for the HA tag in ABCC14HA5. To support this argument, we performed a staining at 37 °C as described above for ABCC14HA5 and also found a weak staining of live cells (data not shown). Thus, the HA tag inserted between Thr30 and Lys31 is close to the extracellular surface of the membrane lipid bilayer, consistent with the predicted topological structure. Gating Function of the Amino Terminus of Human ABCC1—Previously, ABCC14HA5 and ABCC1FLAG-Q have been shown to be functional to transport drug substrates (18Kast C. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26479-26487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Muller M. Yong M. Peng X.H. Petre B. Arora S. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10123-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We next determined if the tagged ABCC1 newly engineered in this study is also functional for drug resistance. For this purpose, we performed 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays of the stable clones expressing ABCC1WT, ABCC11FLAG2, ABCC115HA16, and ABCC130HA31 using four anticancer drugs. As shown in Fig. 5, A-D, all of these clones are resistant to vinblastine, Adriamycin, colchicine, and VP-16 compared with cells transfected with vector alone. Although the resistance factors to all drugs are similar between ABCC1WT, ABCC11FLAG2, and ABCC115HA16, they all appear to be lower than that of ABCC130HA31 (Fig. 5E). Further analysis showed that the resistance factors of ABCC130HA31 to all drugs are significantly higher than that of ABCC1WT after normalizing to their expression levels (Fig. 5F), suggesting that ABCC130HA31 is more active in effluxing anticancer drug substrates than ABCC1WT. Because ABCC130HA31 has an extracellularly located amino terminus compared with ABCC1WT, ABCC11FLAG2, and ABCC115HA16, we hypothesized that the amino terminus of human ABCC1 may function as a gate with a U-shaped folding by plugging into a putative channel in ABCC1WT. The amino-terminal gate may experience transition between two different conformations, open and closed, as shown in Fig. 7C. Insertion of HA epitope at the carboxyl end of the amino terminus (ABCC130HA31) may have forced the gate to open, which allows the protein to transport anticancer drugs more efficiently.FIGURE 7Conformational changes of the amino terminus and its gating role. A, membrane reorientation. HEK293 cells harboring vector control or ABCC115HA16 were first treated with or without vanadate before they were stained by HA antibody. B, effect of amino-terminal peptide on ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 uptake in isolated membrane vesicles. Membrane vesicles from HEK293 cells expressing human ABCC1WT were pretreated with or without 40 mm synthetic peptide Syn.Pep (19Muller M. Yong M. Peng X.H. Petre B. Arora S. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10123-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The vesicles were then pelleted and washed before being used for [3H]LTC4 uptake analysis in the presence of ATP or AMP. Results shown are means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations from a representative experiment. C, schematic model of the gating role of the amino terminus of human ABCC1.

https://openalex.org/W1964968706,"In C11-MDCK cells, which resemble intercalated cells from collecting ducts of the canine kidney, P2Y agonists promote transient activation of the Na+,K+,Cl– cotransporter (NKCC), followed by its sustained inhibition. We designed this study to identify P2Y receptor subtypes involved in dual regulation of this carrier. Real time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that C11-MDCK cells express abundant P2Y1 and P2Y2 mRNA compared with that of other P2Y receptor subtypes. The rank order of potency of agents (ATP ∼ UTP ≫ 2-(methylthio)-ATP (2MeSATP); adenosine 5′-[β-thio]diphosphate (ADPβS) inactive) indicated that P2Y2 rather than P2Y1 receptors mediate a 3–4-fold activation of NKCC within the first 5–10 min of nucleotide addition. NKCC activation in ATP-treated cells was abolished by the intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, calmodulin (CaM) antagonists trifluoroperazine and W-7, and KN-62, an inhibitor of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II. By contrast with the transient activation, 30-min incubation with nucleotides produced up to 4–5-fold inhibition of NKCC, and this inhibition exhibited a rank order of potency (2MeSATP > ADPβS > ATP ≫ UTP) typical of P2Y1 receptors. Unlike the early response, delayed inhibition of NKCC occurred in 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-loaded cells and was completely abolished by the P2Y1 antagonists MRS2179 and MRS2500. Transient activation and delayed inhibition of NKCC in C11 cell monolayers were observed after the addition of ATP to mucosal and serosal solutions, respectively. NKCC inhibition triggered by basolateral application of ADPβS was abolished by MRS2500. Our results thus show that transient activation and delayed inhibition of NKCC in ATP-treated C11-MDCK cells is mediated by Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II- and Ca2+-independent signaling triggered by apical P2Y2 and basolateral P2Y1 receptors, respectively."
