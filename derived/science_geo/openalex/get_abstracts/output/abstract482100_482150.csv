https://openalex.org/W2171016495,"Soluble dietary fibers promote metabolic benefits on body weight and glucose control, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent evidence indicates that intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN) has beneficial effects on glucose and energy homeostasis. Here, we show that the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) propionate and butyrate, which are generated by fermentation of soluble fiber by the gut microbiota, activate IGN via complementary mechanisms. Butyrate activates IGN gene expression through a cAMP-dependent mechanism, while propionate, itself a substrate of IGN, activates IGN gene expression via a gut-brain neural circuit involving the fatty acid receptor FFAR3. The metabolic benefits on body weight and glucose control induced by SCFAs or dietary fiber in normal mice are absent in mice deficient for IGN, despite similar modifications in gut microbiota composition. Thus, the regulation of IGN is necessary for the metabolic benefits associated with SCFAs and soluble fiber."

https://openalex.org/W2161738112,"Neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses have traditionally been thought to provide protection exclusively through their variable region; the contributions of mechanisms conferred by the Fc domain remain controversial. We investigated the in vivo contributions of Fc interactions with their cognate receptors for a collection of neutralizing anti-influenza antibodies. Whereas five broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the conserved stalk region of hemagglutinin (HA) required interactions between the antibody Fc and Fc receptors for IgG (FcγRs) to confer protection from lethal H1N1 challenge, three strain-specific monoclonal Abs (mAbs) against the variable head domain of HA were equally protective in the presence or absence of FcγR interactions. Although all antibodies blocked infection, only anti-stalk bNAbs were capable of mediating cytotoxicity of infected cells, which accounts for their FcγR dependence. Immune complexes generated with anti-HA stalk mAb efficiently interacted with FcγRs, but anti-HA head immune complexes did not. These results suggest that FcγR binding capacity by anti-HA antibodies was dependent on the interaction of the cognate Fab with antigen. We exploited these disparate mechanisms of mAb-mediated protection to reengineer an anti-stalk bNAb to selectively enhance FcγR engagement to augment its protective activity. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized property of bNAbs and guide an approach toward enhancing mAb-mediated antiviral therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2021742495,"Individual differences in motor learning ability are widely acknowledged, yet little is known about the factors that underlie them. Here we explore whether movement-to-movement variability in motor output, a ubiquitous if often unwanted characteristic of motor performance, predicts motor learning ability. Surprisingly, we found that higher levels of task-relevant motor variability predicted faster learning both across individuals and across tasks in two different paradigms, one relying on reward-based learning to shape specific arm movement trajectories and the other relying on error-based learning to adapt movements in novel physical environments. We proceeded to show that training can reshape the temporal structure of motor variability, aligning it with the trained task to improve learning. These results provide experimental support for the importance of action exploration, a key idea from reinforcement learning theory, showing that motor variability facilitates motor learning in humans and that our nervous systems actively regulate it to improve learning."

https://openalex.org/W4233431843,"Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous and poorly understood group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Here we combined whole-exome sequencing of 12 tumor-normal DNA pairs, RNA sequencing analysis and targeted deep sequencing to identify new genetic alterations in PTCL transformation. These analyses identified highly recurrent epigenetic factor mutations in TET2, DNMT3A and IDH2 as well as a new highly prevalent RHOA mutation encoding a p.Gly17Val alteration present in 22 of 35 (67%) angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) samples and in 8 of 44 (18%) PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) samples. Mechanistically, the RHOA Gly17Val protein interferes with RHOA signaling in biochemical and cellular assays, an effect potentially mediated by the sequestration of activated guanine-exchange factor (GEF) proteins. In addition, we describe new and recurrent, albeit less frequent, genetic defects including mutations in FYN, ATM, B2M and CD58 implicating SRC signaling, impaired DNA damage response and escape from immune surveillance mechanisms in the pathogenesis of PTCL."
https://openalex.org/W2074656730,"Type 2 diabetes affects over 300 million people, causing severe complications and premature death, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Pancreatic islet dysfunction is central in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis, and understanding islet genome regulation could therefore provide valuable mechanistic insights. We have now mapped and examined the function of human islet cis-regulatory networks. We identify genomic sequences that are targeted by islet transcription factors to drive islet-specific gene activity and show that most such sequences reside in clusters of enhancers that form physical three-dimensional chromatin domains. We find that sequence variants associated with type 2 diabetes and fasting glycemia are enriched in these clustered islet enhancers and identify trait-associated variants that disrupt DNA binding and islet enhancer activity. Our studies illustrate how islet transcription factors interact functionally with the epigenome and provide systematic evidence that the dysregulation of islet enhancers is relevant to the mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2005174659,"Opioids represent widely prescribed and abused medications, although their signal transduction mechanisms are not well understood. Here we present the 1.8 Å high-resolution crystal structure of the human δ-opioid receptor (δ-OR), revealing the presence and fundamental role of a sodium ion in mediating allosteric control of receptor functional selectivity and constitutive activity. The distinctive δ-OR sodium ion site architecture is centrally located in a polar interaction network in the seven-transmembrane bundle core, with the sodium ion stabilizing a reduced agonist affinity state, and thereby modulating signal transduction. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies reveal that changing the allosteric sodium site residue Asn 131 to an alanine or a valine augments constitutive β-arrestin-mediated signalling. Asp95Ala, Asn310Ala and Asn314Ala mutations transform classical δ-opioid antagonists such as naltrindole into potent β-arrestin-biased agonists. The data establish the molecular basis for allosteric sodium ion control in opioid signalling, revealing that sodium-coordinating residues act as 'efficacy switches' at a prototypic G-protein-coupled receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1974223852,"Douglas Higgs and colleagues report a high-throughput approach, called Capture-C, to analyze interactions between cis regulatory elements. Using Capture-C, the authors interrogated hundreds of specific interactions at high resolution in a single experiment. Gene expression during development and differentiation is regulated in a cell- and stage-specific manner by complex networks of intergenic and intragenic cis-regulatory elements whose numbers and representation in the genome far exceed those of structural genes. Using chromosome conformation capture, it is now possible to analyze in detail the interaction between enhancers, silencers, boundary elements and promoters at individual loci, but these techniques are not readily scalable. Here we present a high-throughput approach (Capture-C) to analyze cis interactions, interrogating hundreds of specific interactions at high resolution in a single experiment. We show how this approach will facilitate detailed, genome-wide analysis to elucidate the general principles by which cis-acting sequences control gene expression. In addition, we show how Capture-C will expedite identification of the target genes and functional effects of SNPs that are associated with complex diseases, which most frequently lie in intergenic cis-acting regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W2145756448,"Craniopharyngiomas are epithelial tumors that typically arise in the suprasellar region of the brain. Patients experience substantial clinical sequelae from both extension of the tumors and therapeutic interventions that damage the optic chiasm, the pituitary stalk and the hypothalamic area. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified mutations in CTNNB1 (β-catenin) in nearly all adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas examined (11/12, 92%) and recurrent mutations in BRAF (resulting in p.Val600Glu) in all papillary craniopharyngiomas (3/3, 100%). Targeted genotyping revealed BRAF p.Val600Glu in 95% of papillary craniopharyngiomas (36 of 39 tumors) and mutation of CTNNB1 in 96% of adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas (51 of 53 tumors). The CTNNB1 and BRAF mutations were clonal in each tumor subtype, and we detected no other recurrent mutations or genomic aberrations in either subtype. Adamantinomatous and papillary craniopharyngiomas harbor mutations that are mutually exclusive and clonal. These findings have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of these neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W2044273929,"Understanding how and where HIV-1 infection persists in the body is crucial for efforts to eradicate the viral reservoir. Now Mathias Lichterfeld and his colleagues report that HIV-1 can infect CD4+ T memory stem cells (TSCM cells) and that infected TSCM cells constitute a stable component of the viral reservoir in individuals treated with antiretroviral therapy. Cellular HIV-1 reservoirs that persist despite antiretroviral treatment are incompletely defined. We show that during suppressive antiretroviral therapy, CD4+ T memory stem cells (TSCM cells) harbor high per-cell levels of HIV-1 DNA and make increasing contributions to the total viral CD4+ T cell reservoir over time. Moreover, we conducted phylogenetic studies that suggested long-term persistence of viral quasispecies in CD4+ TSCM cells. Thus, HIV-1 may exploit the stem cell characteristics of cellular immune memory to promote long-term viral persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2074884450,"Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation typically yields heterogeneous populations. Knowledge of signals controlling embryonic lineage bifurcations could efficiently yield desired cell types through exclusion of alternate fates. Therefore, we revisited signals driving induction and anterior-posterior patterning of definitive endoderm to generate a coherent roadmap for endoderm differentiation. With striking temporal dynamics, BMP and Wnt initially specified anterior primitive streak (progenitor to endoderm), yet, 24 hr later, suppressed endoderm and induced mesoderm. At lineage bifurcations, cross-repressive signals separated mutually exclusive fates; TGF-β and BMP/MAPK respectively induced pancreas versus liver from endoderm by suppressing the alternate lineage. We systematically blockaded alternate fates throughout multiple consecutive bifurcations, thereby efficiently differentiating multiple hPSC lines exclusively into endoderm and its derivatives. Comprehensive transcriptional and chromatin mapping of highly pure endodermal populations revealed that endodermal enhancers existed in a surprising diversity of ""pre-enhancer"" states before activation, reflecting the establishment of a permissive chromatin landscape as a prelude to differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1964110508,"The ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene, found in 25% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases, is acquired in utero but requires additional somatic mutations for overt leukemia. We used exome and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing to characterize secondary events associated with leukemic transformation. RAG-mediated deletions emerge as the dominant mutational process, characterized by recombination signal sequence motifs near breakpoints, incorporation of non-templated sequence at junctions, ∼30-fold enrichment at promoters and enhancers of genes actively transcribed in B cell development and an unexpectedly high ratio of recurrent to non-recurrent structural variants. Single-cell tracking shows that this mechanism is active throughout leukemic evolution, with evidence of localized clustering and reiterated deletions. Integration of data on point mutations and rearrangements identifies ATF7IP and MGA as two new tumor-suppressor genes in ALL. Thus, a remarkably parsimonious mutational process transforms ETV6-RUNX1-positive lymphoblasts, targeting the promoters, enhancers and first exons of genes that normally regulate B cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1988165722,"Optogenetic systems permit the temporal and spatial control of gene expression using light. A variant of the LOV domain–containing EL222 protein displays responsive blue light–gated transcriptional control of genes in zebrafish and in mammalian cell lines. Optogenetic gene expression systems can control transcription with spatial and temporal detail unequaled with traditional inducible promoter systems. However, current eukaryotic light-gated transcription systems are limited by toxicity, dynamic range or slow activation and deactivation. Here we present an optogenetic gene expression system that addresses these shortcomings and demonstrate its broad utility. Our approach uses an engineered version of EL222, a bacterial light-oxygen-voltage protein that binds DNA when illuminated with blue light. The system has a large (>100-fold) dynamic range of protein expression, rapid activation (<10 s) and deactivation kinetics (<50 s) and a highly linear response to light. With this system, we achieve light-gated transcription in several mammalian cell lines and intact zebrafish embryos with minimal basal gene activation and toxicity. Our approach provides a powerful new tool for optogenetic control of gene expression in space and time."
https://openalex.org/W1977921523,"A study investigating the mechanisms underlying lateral inhibition and lineage plasticity in the mouse small intestine crypts in vivo finds that crypt cells maintain a permissive chromatin state upon which a transcription factor acts to determine lineage specification, and this is the basis of lateral inhibition. Intestinal crypts are the focus of intensive study, stimulated in part by the recent discovery of distinct stem-cell populations and markers. Ramesh Shivdasani and colleagues have studied mechanisms underlying lateral inhibition and lineage plasticity in mouse small intestine crypts in vivo. They find that crypt cells maintain a permissive chromatin state upon which a transcription factor acts to determine lineage specification, and that this is the basis of lateral inhibition. Cells differentiate when transcription factors bind accessible cis-regulatory elements to establish specific gene expression programs. In differentiating embryonic stem cells, chromatin at lineage-restricted genes becomes sequentially accessible1,2,3,4, probably by means of ‘pioneer’ transcription factor activity5, but tissues may use other strategies in vivo. Lateral inhibition is a pervasive process in which one cell forces a different identity on its neighbours6, and it is unclear how chromatin in equipotent progenitors undergoing lateral inhibition quickly enables distinct, transiently reversible cell fates. Here we report the chromatin and transcriptional underpinnings of differentiation in mouse small intestine crypts, where notch signalling mediates lateral inhibition to assign progenitor cells into absorptive or secretory lineages7,8,9. Transcript profiles in isolated LGR5+ intestinal stem cells10 and secretory and absorptive progenitors indicated that each cell population was distinct and the progenitors specified. Nevertheless, secretory and absorptive progenitors showed comparable levels of H3K4me2 and H3K27ac histone marks and DNase I hypersensitivity—signifying accessible, permissive chromatin—at most of the same cis-elements. Enhancers acting uniquely in progenitors were well demarcated in LGR5+ intestinal stem cells, revealing early priming of chromatin for divergent transcriptional programs, and retained active marks well after lineages were specified. On this chromatin background, ATOH1, a secretory-specific transcription factor, controls lateral inhibition through delta-like notch ligand genes and also drives the expression of numerous secretory lineage genes. Depletion of ATOH1 from specified secretory cells converted them into functional enterocytes, indicating prolonged responsiveness of marked enhancers to the presence or absence of a key transcription factor. Thus, lateral inhibition and intestinal crypt lineage plasticity involve interaction of a lineage-restricted transcription factor with broadly permissive chromatin established in multipotent stem cells."

Here, we show that G2/M arrest results from untimely activation of the structure-specific endonuclease (SSE) regulator SLX4 complex (SLX4com) by Vpr, a process that requires VPRBP-DDB1-CUL4 E3-ligase complex. Direct interaction of Vpr with SLX4 induced the recruitment of VPRBP and kinase-active PLK1, enhancing the cleavage of DNA by SLX4-associated MUS81-EME1 endonucleases. G2/M arrest-deficient Vpr alleles failed to interact with SLX4 or to induce recruitment of MUS81 and PLK1. Furthermore, knockdown of SLX4, MUS81, or EME1 inhibited Vpr-induced G2/M arrest. In addition, we show that the SLX4com is involved in suppressing spontaneous and HIV-1-mediated induction of type 1 interferon and establishment of antiviral responses. Thus, our work not only reveals the identity of the cellular factors required for Vpr-mediated G2/M arrest but also identifies the SLX4com as a regulator of innate immunity.

Many viruses, including HIV-1, perturb the progression through the host cell cycle. This is achieved through subversion of the boundaries between the DNA replication step (S), segregation of sister chromatids (mitosis), and the gap phases (G1 and G2) (Davy and Doorbar, 2007Davy C. Doorbar J. G2/M cell cycle arrest in the life cycle of viruses.Virology. 2007; 368: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Manipulation of the host cell cycle by HIV-1 is achieved through the highly conserved 96 amino acid Vpr protein that causes a potent cell-cycle arrest at the G2 to mitosis transition (G2/M) in most cycling eukaryotic cells (Di Marzio et al., 1995Di Marzio P.

G2/M arrest by Vpr has been proposed to rely on Vpr-induced activation of the DNA damage surveillance proteins ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM) and ATM and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) that detect DNA lesions and trigger downstream signaling cascades (Poon et al., 1997Poon B.

Activation of the ATR-mediated DNA damage response by the HIV-1 viral protein R.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25879-25886Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Activation of ATM and ATR may cause cell-cycle arrest, which, in the absence of HIV-1 infection, allows time for repair. Importantly, although Vpr expression results in formation of breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1) and γH2ax foci (Zimmerman et al., 2004Zimmerman E.S. Chen J. Andersen J.L. Ardon O. Dehart J.L. Blackett J. Choudhary S.K. Camerini D. Nghiem P. Planelles V.

A proposed scenario is that Vpr activates the G2/M checkpoint through a replication stress-dependent pathway (Li et al., 2010Li G. Park H.U. Liang D. Zhao R.Y. Cell cycle G2/M arrest through an S phase-dependent mechanism by HIV-1 viral protein R.Retrovirology. 2010; 7: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

Homologous recombination (HR) is a crucial repair pathway in mammalian cells, employed to repair DSB and collapsed replication forks. HR allows accurate repair using the sister chromatid as a template and leads to the formation of four-way DNA structures, Holliday junctions (HJ), that must be removed prior to chromosome segregation. In somatic cells, the favored pathway to remove HJ relies on Bloom-related helicases that dissolve HJ in a nonendonucleolytic fashion that prevents sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) (Wu and Hickson, 2003Wu L. Hickson I.D. The Bloom’s syndrome helicase suppresses crossing over during homologous recombination.Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Failure to dissolve HJ may be rescued by the resolution pathway that relies on structure-specific endonuclease (SSE). In human cells, MUS81-EME1, SLX1-SLX4, and GEN1 have been involved in this process (Schwartz and Heyer, 2011Schwartz E.K. Heyer W.D.

Here, we addressed both the molecular mechanism underlying Vpr-mediated G2/M arrest and its significance for HIV-1 life cycle. Using a biochemical approach, we found that the SSE regulator SLX4com interacts with Vpr. We show that Vpr causes untimely activation of SLX4-bound MUS81-EME1 through the recruitment of VPRBP and kinase-active PLK1. Importantly, silencing of subunits of the SLX4com impedes Vpr-induced G2/M arrest. Finally, we show that the targeting of active SLX4com by Vpr to HIV-1 DNA is a viral strategy to avoid innate immune sensing. In order to identify cellular partners involved in Vpr-mediated G2/M arrest, we established a stable monocytic cell line expressing FLAG- and HA-tagged Vpr (iF/H-Vpr) under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (THP-1-iF/H-Vpr). THP-1-iF/H-Vpr or parental THP-1 cells were grown, induced to express iF/H-Vpr, and harvested before G2/M arrest (Figures 1A and S1A available online). Following tandem affinity purification, immunoprecipitated material was resolved on SDS-PAGE and silver-stained (Figure 1B), and protein partners were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Previously identified Vpr partners were recovered, including subunits of the VPRBP-DDB1-CUL4 E3-ligase complex and UNG2 (Casey et al., 2010Casey L. Wen X. de Noronha C.M.

Interestingly, the SSE ERCC1-ERCC4 and MUS81-EME1, together with the SLX4 scaffold protein, were recovered, as well as the poorly characterized TSPYL1 and C20orf94 subunits of the SLX4com (Figures 1B and S1B).Figure S1HIV Vpr Directly Interacts with the C-Terminal Domain of SLX4 and Assembles a Single Complex Containing VPRBP and SLX4, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Kinetics of iF/H-Vpr-mediated G2/M arrest.

Input material and eluates were analyzed by WB using indicated antibodies. We first confirmed the interaction between iF/H-Vpr and the identified SLX4com subunits by western blot (WB) (Figure 1C). Importantly, this interaction is specific to Vpr because immunopurified HIV-2 viral accessory protein Vpx, which is closely related to Vpr (Tristem et al., 1992Tristem M. Marshall C. Karpas A. Hill F. Evolution of the primate lentiviruses: evidence from vpx and vpr.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3405-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), failed to interact with the SLX4com (Figure S1B). In addition, GFP-tagged SLX4 (GFP-SLX4), which is expressed in HeLa cells, colocalized with iF/H-Vpr (Figure S1C), providing further evidence for a physical interaction. Interaction between Vpr and SLX4 was also observed in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml ethidium bromide and 0.1 U/μl DNaseI (Figure S1D), ruling out the requirement for a DNA intermediate. Next, in vitro interaction experiments were performed using recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged Vpr (GST-Vpr) and 6xHistidine-tagged subunits of the SLX4com (HIS6-C20orf94, HIS6-MUS81, and HIS6-EME1) or the C-terminal SLX1 binding domain (SBD) of SLX4 (HIS6-SBD) (Figure S1E). GST-tagged SLX1 (GST-SLX1) was used as a positive control. Direct interaction was only observed between HIS6-SBD and GST-Vpr (Figures 1D and S1F; data not shown). Altogether, these results demonstrate that Vpr directly interacts with the C terminus of SLX4. Because direct interaction between VPRBP and Vpr is required for Vpr-mediated G2/M arrest (Zhao et al., 1994Zhao L.J. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. Biochemical mechanism of HIV-I Vpr function. Specific interaction with a cellular protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15577-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we asked whether VPRBP, Vpr, and subunits of the SLX4com assemble into a single complex. To this aim, glycerol gradient sedimentation of FLAG-purified iF/H-Vpr was performed, followed by WB analysis of collected fractions. Figure 1E shows an overlap of protein distribution along the gradient for all tested subunits. In addition, reciprocal immunoprecipitations (re-IPs) were performed (Figure 1F, left) using extracts prepared from cells expressing both FLAG-tagged SLX4 (FLAG-SLX4) and HA-tagged Vpr under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (iHA-Vpr). Cell extracts were first subjected to FLAG-IP followed by Flag-peptide elution under native conditions. Immunopurified material was further subjected to HA-IP prior to analysis by WB, showing that all tested subunits of the SLX4com and VPRBP copurified with Vpr (Figures 1F and S1G). Taken together, the glycerol gradient velocity analysis and re-IPs strongly suggest that SLX4com subunits, VPRBP, and Vpr assemble in a single complex. Because previous work did not identify VPRBP as a subunit of the SLX4com, we further explored this interaction in the presence and absence of Vpr. To this aim, immunoprecipitation (IP) of FLAG-tagged VPRBP (FLAG-VPRBP) was performed in the presence or absence of iHA-Vpr. The levels of SLX4, ERCC4, and MUS81 associated with VPRBP were significantly enhanced in Vpr-expressing cells (Figure 1G). This shows that VPRBP interacts with the SLX4com and that Vpr enhances this interaction. We next wished to uncover"

We used post-study caffeine administration to test its effect on memory consolidation using a behavioral discrimination task. Caffeine enhanced performance 24 h after administration according to an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve; this effect was specific to consolidation and not retrieval. We conclude that caffeine enhanced consolidation of long-term memories in humans.
https://openalex.org/W2149236471,Self-renewal circuitry in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is increasingly defined. How the robust pluripotency program is dissolved to enable fate transition is less appreciated. Here we develop a forward genetic approach using haploid ESCs. We created libraries of transposon integrations and screened for persistent self-renewal in differentiation-permissive culture. This yielded multiple mutants in the Fgf/Erk and GSK3/Tcf3 modules known to drive differentiation and in epigenetic modifiers implicated in lineage commitment. We also identified and validated factors not previously considered. These include the conserved small zinc finger protein Zfp706 and the RNA binding protein Pum1. Pum1 targets several mRNAs for naive pluripotency transcription factors and accelerates their downregulation at the onset of differentiation. These findings indicate that the dismantling of pluripotent circuitry proceeds at multiple levels. More broadly they exemplify the power of haploid ESCs for genetic interrogation of developmental processes.
https://openalex.org/W2037921624,"The measurement of metabolites such as creatine, which are involved in the tissue creatine kinase reaction, enable the study of the effects of energy deprivation on the heart. Haris and colleagues introduce a new magnetic resonance imaging technique that maps the distribution of creatine in the heart that does not use radiation or exogenous contrast agents and offers higher sensitivity compared to proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods. Feasibility is demonstrated in vivo in infarcted swine myocardium using a standard clinical MRI scanner. ATP derived from the conversion of phosphocreatine to creatine by creatine kinase provides an essential chemical energy source that governs myocardial contraction. Here, we demonstrate that the exchange of amine protons from creatine with protons in bulk water can be exploited to image creatine through chemical exchange saturation transfer (CrEST) in myocardial tissue. We show that CrEST provides about two orders of magnitude higher sensitivity compared to 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results of CrEST studies from ex vivo myocardial tissue strongly correlate with results from 1H and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and biochemical analysis. We demonstrate the feasibility of CrEST measurement in healthy and infarcted myocardium in animal models in vivo on a 3-T clinical scanner. As proof of principle, we show the conversion of phosphocreatine to creatine by spatiotemporal mapping of creatine changes in the exercised human calf muscle. We also discuss the potential utility of CrEST in studying myocardial disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1990850819,"During meiotic prophase, telomere-mediated chromosomal movement along the nuclear envelope is crucial for homologue pairing and synapsis. However, how telomeres are modified to mediate chromosome movement is largely elusive. Here we show that mammalian meiotic telomeres are fundamentally modified by a meiosis-specific Myb-domain protein, TERB1, that localizes at telomeres in mouse germ cells. TERB1 forms a heterocomplex with the canonical telomeric protein TRF1 and binds telomere repeat DNA. Disruption of Terb1 in mice abolishes meiotic chromosomal movement and impairs homologous pairing and synapsis, causing infertility in both sexes. TERB1 promotes telomere association with the nuclear envelope and deposition of the SUN-KASH complex, which recruits cytoplasmic motor complexes. TERB1 also binds and recruits cohesin to telomeres to develop structural rigidity, strikingly reminiscent of centromeres. Our study suggests that TERB1 acts as a central hub for the assembly of a conserved meiotic telomere complex required for chromosome movements."
https://openalex.org/W2084203294,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates immune and inflammatory responses, and its overproduction is a hallmark of inflammatory diseases. Inhibition of IL-6 signaling with the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab has provided some clinical benefit to patients; however, direct cytokine inhibition may be a more effective option. We used the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) process to discover slow off-rate modified aptamers (SOMAmers) with hydrophobic base modifications that inhibit IL-6 signaling in vitro. Two classes of IL-6 SOMAmers were isolated from modified DNA libraries containing 40 random positions and either 5-(N-benzylcarboxamide)-2'-deoxyuridine (Bn-dU) or 5-[N-(1-naphthylmethyl)carboxamide]-2'-deoxyuridine (Nap-dU) replacing dT. These modifications facilitate the high affinity binding interaction with IL-6 and provide resistance against degradation by serum endonucleases. Post-SELEX optimization of one Bn-dU and one Nap-dU SOMAmer led to improvements in IL-6 binding (10-fold) and inhibition activity (greater than 20-fold), resulting in lead SOMAmers with sub-nanomolar affinity (Kd = 0.2 nm) and potency (IC50 = 0.2 nm). Although similar in inhibition properties, the two SOMAmers have unique sequences and different ortholog specificities. Furthermore, these SOMAmers were stable in human serum in vitro for more than 48 h. Both SOMAmers prevented IL-6 signaling by blocking the interaction of IL-6 with its receptor and inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro as effectively as tocilizumab. This new class of IL-6 inhibitor may be an effective therapeutic alternative for patients suffering from inflammatory diseases."

PtdIns(4,5)P2 is one of the most important regulatory lipids in the PM. It is a precursor of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, generated by PLC enzymes, and of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate produced by PI3Ks. PtdIns(4,5)P2 also serves as regulator of ion channels and transporters and interacts with proteins that regulate both endocytosis and exocytosis (1.Balla T. Phosphoinositides: tiny lipids with giant impact on cell regulation.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 1019-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Therefore, PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis is essential for cells and so are the PI4Ks that produce PtdIns(4)P to be converted to PtdIns(4,5)P2. However, the identification of four distinct mammalian PI4Ks and subsequent studies on the biology of these enzymes clearly indicated that the different PI4K enzymes and PtdIns(4)P have functions unrelated to PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis (2.Balla A.

Although the mammalian PI4KA is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (2.Balla A. Balla T.

Baskin J.M. Chung J. Tanner L.B. Shui G. Lee S.Y. Pirruccello M. Hao M. Ingolia N.T. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P.

Part of the reasons why the functions of PI4KA have been so difficult to understand is the lack of specific inhibitors of its enzymatic functions. The only way to study the importance of the enzyme was to use siRNA-mediated gene silencing. This procedure takes several days, and assuming critical roles of these enzymes (both Pik1 and Stt4 mutant yeast strains are practically unviable), cells with efficient knockdown may be eliminated, and the surviving cells may have enough enzyme left to support essential functions. In addition, conclusions from siRNA studies may be confounded by functions prescribed to domains found outside the enzymatic modality, which may be involved in scaffolding or other protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of infection (14.Altan-Bonnet N.

An unexpected and much needed stimulus in PI4K research was brought about by the finding that PI4KA is an essential host factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, reported in several simultaneous studies using RNAi screens (15.Vaillancourt F.H.

In parallel studies, it was also shown that several small RNA enteroviruses reprogrammed the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi trafficking machinery to serve their replication needs and used another PI4K, PI4KB, in the process (14.Altan-Bonnet N.

Viral reorganization of the secretory pathway generates distinct organelles for RNA replication.Cell. 2010; 141: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). These studies offered new possibilities to counter the establishment of viral replication machinery using PI4K inhibitors. The important feature of these studies was that viral replication was almost completely abolished by even partial PI4K knockdown, which elicited no apparent cellular toxicity in vitro (21.Tai A.W. Salloum S. The role of the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase PI4KA in hepatitis C virus-induced host membrane rearrangement.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e26300Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings have confirmed our previous conclusions that even small amounts of the enzyme can fulfill its “housekeeping” functions (9.Balla A. Tuymetova G. Tsiomenko A. Várnai P. Balla T.

Cell. 2005; 16: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because of this difference for the enzyme for viral replication versus normal cellular functions, some viral studies have concluded that PI4Ks are not important for the cell, and they can be targeted without any problem as an antiviral therapeutic strategy. These conclusions started to be challenged by reports showing deleterious effects of PI4KA genetic inactivation (22.Vaillancourt F.H. Brault M. Pilote L. Uyttersprot N. Gaillard E.T. Stoltz J.H.

In this study, we report on the characterization of a set of compounds that selectively inhibit PI4KA and interfere with HCV replication. We show that these compounds inhibit the synthesis of PtdIns(4)P in the PM and impair the maintenance of PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels under strong PLC activation. Curiously, the potency of these compounds to inhibit purified PI4KA in vitro and to inhibit PtdIns(4)P synthesis in the PM in cells shows significant variations raising questions about the ability of the compounds to reach the relevant cellular compartments despite similar chemistries. Importantly, the inhibitory effects on PtdIns(4)P in the PM and on PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in PLC-stimulated cells were closely correlated. Toxicity studies in animals showed that the most potent small molecule inhibitors of PtdIns(4)P synthesis and PtdIns(4,5)P2 maintenance caused sudden death when applied at high doses with symptoms reminiscent of cardiovascular collapse. These may reflect the ability of the compound to inhibit PtdIns(4,5)P2 maintenance during Gq-coupled receptor signaling that is essential for maintaining vascular tone. Finally, genetic inactivation of the PI4KA enzyme in adult animals with a tamoxifen-induced conditional knock-out mouse caused a lethal gastrointestinal phenotype that was different from the acute drug-induced toxicity. These differences will require further studies to be fully understood but highlight the need for both types of approaches to anticipate the results of pharmacological interventions on the biology of whole animals.

Cells (50,000 cells/well) were plated onto 25-mm-diameter circular glass coverslips in 6-well plates, and plasmid DNAs (0.5–1 μg/well) were transfected with the PLCδ1-PH-GFP or Tubby domain-GFP fusion constructs (27.Szentpetery Z.

After 20–24 h of transfection, cells were washed on glass coverslips with a modified Krebs-Ringer solution, containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4, and the coverslip was placed into a metal chamber (Atto, Invitrogen) that was mounted on a heated stage (35 °C or room temperature for HEK293-AT1 cells). Cells were incubated in 1 ml of the Krebs-Ringer buffer, and the stimuli were dissolved and added in 200 μl of warm buffer removed from the cells. Cells were examined in an inverted microscope. Confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510-META laser confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) using a 63× oil-immersion objective equipped with an objective heater (Bioptech). HEK293-AT1 cells were transfected with the Tubby domain-GFP construct. After 24 h, cells were mounted in the Atto chambers and imaged in a Zeiss LSM 510-META confocal microscope at room temperature. After stimulation with 100 nm AngII, the translocation of the GFP probe was monitored in time-lapse imaging. The translocation of the construct from the membrane to the cytosol was quantified by measuring cytosolic GFP intensity in regions of interest outside the nucleus and plotted against time using the Zeiss image processing software. Intensity curves were normalized to prestimulatory values, and they were averaged from a large number of cells in recordings obtained in several dishes in multiple independent experiments. HEK293-AT1 cells were transfected with the CFP- and YFP-tagged PLCδ1-PH constructs for 24 h. After transfection, cells were mounted in the Atto chambers and imaged in an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with a Micromax 1024BFT (Princeton Instruments) camera, a Lambda-DG4 illuminator (Sutter), and a beam-splitter (Optical-Insights) that contained the filter set for recording YFP and CFP fluorescence. Data acquisition and processing were done with the MetaFluor software. The ratios of YFP to CFP for individual cells were calculated normalizing to their initial values before stimulation. Recordings from several cells in each dish and several dishes from separate experiments were pooled and averaged. HEK293-AT1 cells plated on 12-well plates (at a density of 30,000 cells/ml) were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol (20 μCi/ml) in 1 ml of inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 2% dialyzed FBS for 24 h or with 2 μCi/ml o-[32P]phosphate for 3 h in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 2% dialyzed FBS. Cells were treated with various concentrations of the drugs (dissolved in DMSO) for 10 min and stimulated with angiotensin II (100 nm) for the indicated times or left unstimulated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of ice-cold perchloric acid (5% final concentration), and cells were kept on ice for 30 min. After scraping and freezing/thawing, the cells were centrifuged, and the cell pellet was processed to extract the phosphoinositides by an acidic chloroform/methanol extraction followed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) essentially as described previously (10.Balla A.

COS-7 cells were grown to ∼50% confluence on poly-l-lysine-coated 8-well test slides and then treated for 10 min with the indicated concentration of PI4K inhibitor in 0.1% DMSO/phenol red-free DMEM in a total volume of 25 μl at 37 °C, 10% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. The cells were then rapidly fixed by the addition of a further 25 μl of PIPES buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 20 mm Na-PIPES, pH 6.8) containing 0.4% (w/v) formaldehyde and 0.4% (w/v) glutaraldehyde and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before placing the cells on ice for all subsequent steps. Autofluorescence was quenched by three 2-min washes in freshly prepared 1% (w/v) sodium borohydride in PIPES buffer. Cells were then stained for 30 min sequentially in ice-cold blocking buffer (PIPES buffer supplemented with 0.5% saponin and 5% normal goat serum) containing 1.25 μg/ml anti-PtdIns(4)P IgM and 50 nm GST-PH-PLCδ1, followed by 2.5 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-GST in the continued presence of anti-PtdIns(4)P. After two rinses in ice-cold PIPES buffer, cells were stained for a further 30 min in ice-cold blocking buffer containing 5 μg/ml each of AlexaFluor647-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor555-conjugated anti-mouse IgM, as well as 5 units/ml AlexaFluor488-conjugated phalloidin (Life Sciences). Finally, cells were rinsed four times in ice-cold PIPES buffer, post-fixed for 10 min in ice-cold 4% (w/v) formaldehyde in PIPES buffer, rinsed three times in PIPES buffer, once in water, and mounted in ProLong Gold containing DAPI (Life Sciences). Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 using a 20 × 0.8 NA air objective with the confocal pinhole fully opened to capture fluorescence from the entire depth of the cells. For quantitative analysis, the images were automatically analyzed by using an automated pipeline that used the open access package Cell Profiler (31.Carpenter A.E. Jones T.R. Lamprecht M.R. Clarke C.

For each experiment, background fluorescence intensity (measured for cells whereby primary lipid probes were omitted) was subtracted. Individual intensity values were then normalized to the mean intensity value for the 0.1% DMSO control condition. These normalized intensity values were pooled to create the grand mean from independent experiments. Data were plotted in Prism 5 (Graphpad), and fit with the function shown in Equation 1,I=Imin+(Imax−Imin)1+10(x−log IC50)(Eq. 1) where I is the normalized mean pixel intensity, and x is log[inhibitor]. Enzymes were prepared from COS-7 cells expressing the respective kinases epitope-tagged with an HA, FLAG, or Myc tag at their N termini. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates, and after several washes, their activity was measured on agarose beads. The activities of PI4Ks were measured as incorporation of radioactivity from [γ-32P]ATP into organic solvent-extractable material (32.Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T.

The standard reaction mixture for PtdIns 4-kinase (50 μl final volume) contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μm PtdIns, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2-μCi per reaction), and the enzyme. All assay components, except [γ-32P]ATP, were preincubated with inhibitors for 10 min at 30 °C. Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, which was also used in the control samples. Reactions were started by addition of [γ-32P]ATP, incubated for 10–30 min, and terminated by the addition of 3 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/concentrated HCl (200:100:0.75 (v/v). Reactions were terminated, lipids extracted, and their activity measured by scintillation counting essentially as described previously (32.Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T.

The activity of PIP 5-kinases was measured as incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into PtdIns(4)P. The kinase reaction was carried out in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (50 μm final), 10 mm MgCl2, 67 μm PtdIns(4)P, and 133 μm phosphatidylserine. The reaction was initiated by adding ATP and carried out for 20 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl and then extracted with 250 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) twice. Finally, lipids in organic phase were dried and quantified by scintillation counting. Compounds were assayed for activity against HCV using the genotype 1a, 1b (ET cell line), and 2a (Lunet cell line) subgenomic NS3-NS5B replicon model systems as described recently (33.Leivers A.L.

Cre-lox technology was used to generate a temporally controlled, conditional knock-out (cKO) of the Pi4ka gene. Standard gene targeting approaches were used to generate BA1 embryonic stem cells (hybrid C57BL/6 × 129/SvEv) heterozygous for the Pi4ka primary targeted allele (see Fig. 1 for details). An 8.95-kb region used to construct the targeting vector was subcloned from a C57BL/6 BAC clone. The 2-kb short homology arm and the 6-kb long homology arm were placed 5′ and 3′, respectively, of a loxP/FRT-flanked neomycin resistance cassette in the 3′–5′ orientation, together with the “target” region containing a further loxP element positioned 3′ to exon 48. Homologous recombination in neomycin-resistant ES cells was confirmed at the 5′ and 3′ ends by Southern blot analysis using NsiI-digested ES cell-derived genomic DNA and probes external to the homology arms, and the presence of the 3′ loxP element was confirmed by PCR (data not shown). Correctly targeted ES cell clones were subsequently injected into C57BL/6-derived blastocysts. Resultant male chimeras were crossed with C57BL/6 female mice carrying an Flp recombinase transgene to remove the neomycin resistance cassette, and the resulting mice heterozygous for the Pi4ka conditional allele were bred to wild-type mice to remove the Flp recombinase transgene. Standard breeding procedures were then used to generate study populations of mice homozygous for the Pi4ka conditional allele and carrying the R26MCM transgene. The latter transgene expresses the MerCreMer cDNA (34.Verrou C. Zhang Y. Zürn C. Schamel W.W. Reth M. Comparison of the tamoxifen regulated chimeric Cre recombinases MerCreMer and CreMer.Biol.

Here we devised a new conditional bacterial artificial chromosome rescue strategy to show, in mice, that targeted MOR expression in a subpopulation of striatal direct-pathway neurons enriched in the striosome and nucleus accumbens, in an otherwise MOR-null background, restores opiate reward and opiate-induced striatal dopamine release and partially restores motivation to self administer an opiate. However, these mice lack opiate analgesia or withdrawal. We used Cre-mediated deletion of the rescued MOR transgene to establish that expression of the MOR transgene in the striatum, rather than in extrastriatal sites, is needed for the restoration of opiate reward. Our study demonstrates that a subpopulation of striatal direct-pathway neurons is sufficient to support opiate reward-driven behaviors and provides a new intersectional genetic approach to dissecting neurocircuit-specific gene function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2062370602,"Inhibition sculpts neural activity through various cell types and circuits, but, unlike excitation, it is not self-propagating and must be locally recruited with a temporal delay. Here the authors show a fast, feedforward inhibitory mechanism that bypasses synaptic delay through ephaptic coupling of an interneuron to the axon initial segment of a projection cell. Excitatory synaptic activity in the brain is shaped and balanced by inhibition. Because inhibition cannot propagate, it is often recruited with a synaptic delay by incoming excitation. Cerebellar Purkinje cells are driven by long-range excitatory parallel fiber inputs, which also recruit local inhibitory basket cells. The axon initial segment of each Purkinje cell is ensheathed by basket cell axons in a structure called the pinceau, which is largely devoid of chemical synapses. In mice, we found at the single-cell level that the pinceau mediates ephaptic inhibition of Purkinje cell firing at the site of spike initiation. The reduction of firing rate was synchronous with the presynaptic action potential, eliminating a synaptic delay and allowing granule cells to inhibit Purkinje cells without a preceding phase of excitation. Axon-axon ephaptic intercellular signaling can therefore mediate near-instantaneous feedforward and lateral inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2021409414,"HP1(Hsα)-containing heterochromatin is located near centric regions of chromosomes and regulates DNA-mediated processes such as DNA repair and transcription. The higher-order structure of heterochromatin contributes to this regulation, yet the structure of heterochromatin is not well understood. We took a multidisciplinary approach to determine how HP1(Hsα)-nucleosome interactions contribute to the structure of heterochromatin. We show that HP1(Hsα) preferentially binds histone H3K9Me3-containing nucleosomal arrays in favor of non-methylated nucleosomal arrays and that nonspecific DNA interactions and pre-existing chromatin compaction promote binding. The chromo and chromo shadow domains of HP1(Hsα) play an essential role in HP1(Hsα)-nucleosome interactions, whereas the hinge region appears to have a less significant role. Electron microscopy of HP1(Hsα)-associated nucleosomal arrays showed that HP1(Hsα) caused nucleosome associations within an array, facilitating chromatin condensation. Differential sedimentation of HP1(Hsα)-associated nucleosomal arrays showed that HP1(Hsα) promotes interactions between arrays. These strand-to-strand interactions are supported by in vivo studies where tethering the Drosophila homologue HP1a to specific sites promotes interactions with distant chromosomal sites. Our findings demonstrate that HP1(Hsα)-nucleosome interactions cause chromatin condensation, a process that regulates many chromosome events."
https://openalex.org/W2066522201,"IL-6 is a secreted cytokine that functions through binding two cell surface receptors, IL-6Rα and gp130. Because of its involvement in the progression of several chronic inflammatory diseases, IL-6 is a target of pharmacologic interest. We have recently identified a novel class of ligands called SOMAmers (S low Off-rate Modified Aptamers) that bind IL-6 and inhibit its biologic activity. SOMAmers exploit the chemical diversity of protein-like side chains assembled on flexible nucleic acid scaffolds, resulting in an expanded repertoire of intra- and intermolecular interactions not achievable with conventional aptamers. Here, we report the co-crystal structure of a high affinity SOMAmer (Kd = 0.20 nm) modified at the 5-position of deoxyuridine in a complex with IL-6. The SOMAmer, comprised of a G-quartet domain and a stem-loop domain, engages IL-6 in a clamp-like manner over an extended surface exhibiting close shape complementarity with the protein. The interface is characterized by substantial hydrophobic interactions overlapping the binding surfaces of the IL-6Rα and gp130 receptors. The G-quartet domain retains considerable binding activity as a disconnected autonomous fragment (Kd = 270 nm). A single substitution from our diversely modified nucleotide library leads to a 37-fold enhancement in binding affinity of the G-quartet fragment (Kd = 7.4 nm). The ability to probe ligand surfaces in this manner is a powerful tool in the development of new therapeutic reagents with improved pharmacologic properties. The SOMAmer·IL-6 structure also expands our understanding of the diverse structural motifs achievable with modified nucleic acid libraries and elucidates the nature with which these unique ligands interact with their protein targets."
https://openalex.org/W2143808146,"Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells from patient fibroblasts containing ring chromosomes with large deletions reveals that reprogrammed cells lose the abnormal chromosome and duplicate the wild-type homologue through compensatory uniparental disomy, suggesting that cellular reprogramming may hold potential for ‘chromosome therapy’. Ring chromosomes are structural aberrations that are often associated with birth defects, mental disabilities and growth retardation. Shinya Yamanaka and colleagues derived human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from patient fibroblasts containing ring chromosomes with large deletions, and found that reprogrammed cells lose the abnormal chromosome and duplicate the wild-type homologue through the compensatory uniparental disomy mechanism. Thus, iPS cells have an intrinsic capacity to purge very damaged chromosomes that have ring structures and deletions spanning hundreds of megabases of DNA. The authors propose that cellular reprogramming might serve a very different function to the familiar one, acting as a means of 'chromosome therapy' that reverses combined loss-of-function across many genes in cells with large-scale aberrations involving ring structures. Ring chromosomes are structural aberrations commonly associated with birth defects, mental disabilities and growth retardation1,2. Rings form after fusion of the long and short arms of a chromosome, and are sometimes associated with large terminal deletions2. Owing to the severity of these large aberrations that can affect multiple contiguous genes, no possible therapeutic strategies for ring chromosome disorders have been proposed. During cell division, ring chromosomes can exhibit unstable behaviour leading to continuous production of aneuploid progeny with low viability and high cellular death rate3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The overall consequences of this chromosomal instability have been largely unexplored in experimental model systems. Here we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)10,11,12 from patient fibroblasts containing ring chromosomes with large deletions and found that reprogrammed cells lost the abnormal chromosome and duplicated the wild-type homologue through the compensatory uniparental disomy (UPD) mechanism. The karyotypically normal iPSCs with isodisomy for the corrected chromosome outgrew co-existing aneuploid populations, enabling rapid and efficient isolation of patient-derived iPSCs devoid of the original chromosomal aberration. Our results suggest a fundamentally different function for cellular reprogramming as a means of ‘chromosome therapy’13 to reverse combined loss-of-function across many genes in cells with large-scale aberrations involving ring structures. In addition, our work provides an experimentally tractable human cellular system for studying mechanisms of chromosomal number control, which is of critical relevance to human development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2105073325,"Mdm2 is a critical negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Mdm2 is an E3 ligase whose overexpression leads to functional inactivation of p53. Mdm2 protein stability is regulated by several mechanisms including RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain-mediated autoubiquitination. Here we report biochemical identification of NEDD4-1 as an E3 ligase for Mdm2 that contributes to the regulation of Mdm2 protein stability in cells. NEDD4-1 was identified from Jurkat cytosolic fractions using an enzyme-dead Mdm2 mutant protein as a substrate for in vitro E3 ligase assays. We show that lysates from Nedd4-1 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have significantly diminished E3 ligase activity toward Mdm2 compared with lysates from wild-type (WT) MEFs. Recombinant NEDD4-1 promotes Mdm2 ubiquitination in vitro in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In cells, NEDD4-1 physically interacts with Mdm2 via the RING domain of Mdm2. Overexpression of NEDD4-1, but not an enzyme-dead NEDD4-1CS mutant, increases ubiquitination of Mdm2. NEDD4-1 catalyzes the formation of K63-type polyubiquitin chains on Mdm2 that are distinct from K48-type polyubiquitination chains mediated by the Mdm2/MdmX complex. Importantly, K63-type polyubiquitination by NEDD4-1 competes with K48-type polyubiquitination on Mdm2 in cells. As a result, NEDD4-1-mediated ubiquitination stabilizes Mdm2. NEDD4-1 knockdown reduces the t1/2 (half-life) of endogenous Mdm2 from 20 to 12 min in U2OS cells. Nedd4-1 KO MEFs manifest increased p53 levels and activity, a more robust DNA damage response and increased G1 arrest compared with WT MEFs. Similarly, NEDD4-1 knockdown in WT-p53-bearing cells increases basal p53 levels and activity in an Mdm2-dependent manner, causes stronger p53 responses to DNA damage and results in p53-dependent growth inhibition compared with corresponding NEDD4-1-proficient control cells. This study identifies NEDD4-1 as a novel component of the p53/Mdm2 regulatory feedback loop that controls p53 activity during stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2024665579,"In eukaryotes, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an essential ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that associates with numerous client proteins. HtpG, a prokaryotic homolog of Hsp90, is essential for thermotolerance in cyanobacteria, and in vitro it suppresses the aggregation of denatured proteins efficiently. Understanding how the non-native client proteins bound to HtpG refold is of central importance to comprehend the essential role of HtpG under stress. Here, we demonstrate by yeast two-hybrid method, immunoprecipitation assays, and surface plasmon resonance techniques that HtpG physically interacts with DnaJ2 and DnaK2. DnaJ2, which belongs to the type II J-protein family, bound DnaK2 or HtpG with submicromolar affinity, and HtpG bound DnaK2 with micromolar affinity. Not only DnaJ2 but also HtpG enhanced the ATP hydrolysis by DnaK2. Although assisted by the DnaK2 chaperone system, HtpG enhanced native refolding of urea-denatured lactate dehydrogenase and heat-denatured glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. HtpG did not substitute for DnaJ2 or GrpE in the DnaK2-assisted refolding of the denatured substrates. The heat-denatured malate dehydrogenase that did not refold by the assistance of the DnaK2 chaperone system alone was trapped by HtpG first and then transferred to DnaK2 where it refolded. Dissociation of substrates from HtpG was either ATP-dependent or -independent depending on the substrate, indicating the presence of two mechanisms of cooperative action between the HtpG and the DnaK2 chaperone system."
https://openalex.org/W1986141384,"Dendritic cells (DC) play a critical role in modulating antigen-specific immune responses elicited by T cells via engagement of the prototypic T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 by the cognate ligands CD80/CD86, expressed on DC. Although CD28 signaling in T cell activation has been well characterized, it has only recently been shown that CD80/CD86, which have no demonstrated binding domains for signaling proteins in their cytoplasmic tails, nonetheless also transduce signals to the DC. Functionally, CD80/CD86 engagement results in DC production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, which is necessary for full T cell activation. However, ligation of CD80/CD86 by CTLA4 also induces DC production of the immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which depletes local pools of the essential amino acid tryptophan, resulting in blockade of T cell activation. Despite the significant role of CD80/CD86 in immunological processes and the seemingly opposing roles they play by producing IL-6 and IDO upon their activation, how CD80/CD86 signal remains poorly understood. We have now found that cross-linking CD80/CD86 in human DC activates the PI3K/AKT pathway. This results in phosphorylation/inactivation of its downstream target, FOXO3A, and alleviates FOXO3A-mediated suppression of IL-6 expression. A second event downstream of AKT phosphorylation is activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway, which induces IL-6 expression. In addition to these downstream pathways, we unexpectedly found that CD80/CD86-induced PI3K signaling is regulated by previously unrecognized cross-talk with NOTCH1 signaling. This cross-talk is facilitated by NOTCH-mediated up-regulation of the expression of prolyl isomerase PIN1, which in turn increases enzyme activity of casein kinase II. Subsequently, phosphatase and tensin homolog (which suppresses PI3K activity) is inactivated via phosphorylation by casein kinase II. This results in full activation of PI3K signaling upon cross-linking CD80/CD86. Similar to IL-6, we have found that CD80/CD86-induced IDO production by DC at late time points is also dependent upon the PI3K → AKT → NF-κB pathway and requires cross-talk with NOTCH signaling. These data further suggest that the same signaling pathways downstream of DC CD80/CD86 cross-linking induce early IL-6 production to enhance T cell activation, followed by later IDO production to self-limit this activation. In addition to characterizing the pathways downstream of CD80/CD86 in IL-6 and IDO production, identification of a novel cross-talk between NOTCH1 and PI3K signaling may provide new insights in other biological processes where PI3K signaling plays a major role."
https://openalex.org/W2083022228,"ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable) have been implicated in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and damage responses. However, the regulatory mechanisms that control the function of chromatin remodelers in DNA damage response are largely unknown. Here, we show that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) mediates the phosphorylation of BRG1, the catalytic ATPase of the SWI/SNF complex that contributes to DSB repair by binding γ-H2AX-containing nucleosomes via interaction with acetylated histone H3 and stimulating γ-H2AX formation, at Ser-721 in response to DNA damage. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BRG1 occurs rapidly and transiently after DNA damage. Phosphorylated BRG1 binds γ-H2AX-containing nucleosomes to form the repair foci. The Ser-721 phosphorylation of BRG1 is critical for binding γ-H2AX-containing nucleosomes and stimulating γ-H2AX formation and DSB repair. BRG1 binds to acetylated H3 peptides much better after phosphorylation at Ser-721 by DNA damage. However, the phosphorylation of Ser-721 does not significantly affect the ATPase and transcriptional activities of BRG1. These results, establishing BRG1 as a novel and functional ATM substrate, suggest that the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of BRG1 facilitates DSB repair by stimulating the association of this remodeler with γ-H2AX nucleosomes via enhancing the affinity to acetylated H3. Our work also suggests that the mechanism of BRG1 stimulation of DNA repair is independent of the remodeler's enzymatic or transcriptional activities."
https://openalex.org/W2044829994,"Tumor cell invasion is a major contributor to cancer morbidity, and is of particular importance in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the highest grade and most aggressive primary brain tumor. Tumor cell invasion and the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are required for GBM invasion, are enhanced by inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) gene family members, Id1, Id2 and Id3, which can be highly expressed in glioma. Id4 is expressed in GBM at more variable levels than these other family members and we sought to determine its role in invasion. We found, unexpectedly, that invasion was dramatically inhibited in cells expressing Id4 as a result of decreased MMP2, a secreted proteinase key for brain tumor invasion. We demonstrate that Id4 decreased MMP2 expression by a direct inhibitory interaction with Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor known to increase MMP2 expression. Importantly, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we show that Id4 expression correlates with survival of glioblastoma patients and inversely correlates with MMP2 expression. These data suggest that the upregulation of MMP2 resulting from decreased Id4 expression in GBM may contribute to the morbidity and mortality of GBM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2146747189,"Invadopodia are actin-rich protrusions arising through the orchestrated regulation of precursor assembly, stabilization, and maturation, endowing cancer cells with invasive properties. Using nanobodies (antigen-binding domains of Camelid heavy-chain antibodies) as perturbators of intracellular functions and/or protein domains at the level of the endogenous protein, we examined the specific contribution of fascin and cortactin during invadopodium formation in MDA-MB-231 breast and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. A nanobody (Kd~35 nM, 1:1 stoichiometry) that disrupts fascin F-actin bundling emphasizes the importance of stable actin bundles in invadopodium array organization and turnover, matrix degradation, and cancer cell invasion. Cortactin-SH3 dependent WIP recruitment toward the plasma membrane was specifically inhibited by a cortactin nanobody (Kd~75 nM, 1:1 stoichiometry). This functional domain is shown to be important for formation of properly organized invadopodia, MMP-9 secretion, matrix degradation, and cancer cell invasion. Notably, using a subcellular delocalization strategy to trigger protein loss of function, we uncovered a fascin-bundling-independent role in MMP-9 secretion.

However, current methods to analyze flux in vivo provide either a steady-state overview of relative activities (infusion of (13)C and analysis of extracted metabolites) or a dynamic view of a few reactions (hyperpolarized (13)C spectroscopy). Moreover, although hyperpolarization has successfully quantified pyruvate-lactate exchanges, its ability to assess mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is unproven in cancer. Here, we combined (13)C hyperpolarization and isotopomer analysis to quantify multiple fates of pyruvate simultaneously. Two cancer cell lines with divergent pyruvate metabolism were incubated with thermally polarized [3-(13)C]pyruvate for several hours, then briefly exposed to hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate during acquisition of NMR spectra using selective excitation to maximize detection of H[(13)C]O3(-) and [1-(13)C]lactate. Metabolites were then extracted and subjected to isotopomer analysis to determine relative rates of pathways involving [3-(13)C]pyruvate. Quantitation of hyperpolarized H[(13)C]O3(-) provided a single definitive metabolic rate, which was then used to convert relative rates derived from isotopomer analysis into quantitative fluxes. This revealed that H[(13)C]O3(-) appearance reflects activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase rather than pyruvate carboxylation followed by subsequent decarboxylation reactions. Glucose substantially altered [1-(13)C]pyruvate metabolism, enhancing exchanges with [1-(13)C]lactate and suppressing H[(13)C]O3(-) formation. Furthermore, inhibiting Akt, an oncogenic kinase that stimulates glycolysis, reversed these effects, indicating that metabolism of pyruvate by both LDH and pyruvate dehydrogenase is subject to the acute effects of oncogenic signaling on glycolysis. The data suggest that combining (13)C isotopomer analyses and dynamic hyperpolarized (13)C spectroscopy may enable quantitative flux measurements in living tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2011154374,"Recent studies support the role of cysteine oxidation in actin cytoskeleton reorganization during cell adhesion. The aim of this study was to explain whether protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is responsible for the thiol-disulfide rearrangement in the β-actin molecule of adhering cells. First, we showed that PDI forms a disulfide-bonded complex with β-actin with a molecular mass of 110 kDa. Specific interaction of both proteins was demonstrated by a solid phase binding assay, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and immunoprecipitation experiments. Second, using confocal microscopy, we found that both proteins colocalized when spreading MEG-01 cells on fibronectin. Colocalization of PDI and β-actin could be abolished by the membrane-permeable sulfhydryl blocker, N-ethylmaleimide, by the RGD peptide, and by anti-αIIbβ3 antibodies. Consequently, down-regulation of PDI expression by antisense oligonucleotides impaired the spreading of cells and initiated reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Third, because of transfection experiments followed by immunoprecipitation and confocal analysis, we provided evidence that PDI binds to the β-actin Cys(374) thiol. Formation of the β-actin-PDI complex was mediated by integrin-dependent signaling in response to the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. Our data suggest that PDI is released from subcellular compartments to the cytosol and translocated toward the periphery of the cell, where it forms a disulfide bond with β-actin when MEG-01 cells adhere via the αIIbβ3 integrin to fibronectin. Thus, PDI appears to regulate cytoskeletal reorganization by the thiol-disulfide exchange in β-actin via a redox-dependent mechanism."

One such condition, hereditary paraganglioma 2 (PGL2), is caused by a G78R mutation in the assembly factor SDH5. Although SDH5G78R is deficient in its ability to promote SDHA flavinylation, it has remained unclear whether impairment to its import, structure, or stability contributes to its loss of function. Using import-chase analysis in human mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells, we found that the import and maturation of human SDH5G78R was normal, while its stability was reduced significantly, with ~25% of the protein remaining after 180 min compared to ~85% for the wild-type protein. Notably, the metabolic stability of SDH5G78R was restored to wild-type levels by depleting mitochondrial LON (LONM). Degradation of SDH5G78R by LONM was confirmed in vitro; however, in contrast to the in organello analysis, wild-type SDH5 was also rapidly degraded by LONM. SDH5 instability was confirmed in SDHA-depleted mitochondria. Blue native PAGE showed that imported SDH5G78R formed a transient complex with SDHA; however, this complex was stabilized in LONM depleted mitochondria. These data demonstrate that SDH5 is protected from LONM-mediated degradation in mitochondria by its stable interaction with SDHA, a state that is dysregulated in PGL2.—Bezawork-Geleta, A., Saiyed, T., Dougan, D.

The ability of SmgGDS to interact with multiple GTPases and affect their nucleotide activity is most likely due to the binding of other guanine nucleotide exchange factors to the scaffold-like SmgGDS, because scaffolds form a platform for protein interactions (20Berg T.J.

Interestingly, it was reported that SmgGDS-607 will only associate with nonprenylated GTPases, whereas SmgGDS-558 will only associate with prenylated GTPases, yet the mechanism for the recognition of prenylated versus nonprenylated GTPases has not been characterized (20Berg T.J. Gastonguay A.J. Lorimer E.L. Kuhnmuench J.R. Li R. Fields A.P. Williams C.L. Splice variants of SmgGDS control small GTPase prenylation and membrane localization.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35255-35266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We previously found that SmgGDS-607 more effectively regulates the prenylation of GTPases that will become geranylgeranylated, such as Rap1, RhoA, and Rac1, compared with GTPases that will become farnesylated, such as K-Ras (20Berg T.J. Gastonguay A.J. Lorimer E.L. Kuhnmuench J.R. Li R. Fields A.P. Williams C.L. Splice variants of SmgGDS control small GTPase prenylation and membrane localization.J. Biol.

This effect that SmgGDS-607 has on GTPases that will become geranylgeranylated, but not on GTPases that will become farnesylated, provides insight into its mechanism of interaction. In this study we use K-Ras and Rap1B as model GTPases that become farnesylated and geranylgeranylated, respectively, to define the parameters that promote their physical interactions with SmgGDS splice variants. We report that SmgGDS-607 recognizes the last amino acid of a GTPase for interaction and is also involved primarily in the geranylgeranylation pathway. Our results provide evidence that SmgGDS-607 and SmgGDS-558 structurally interact with GTPases similarly in vitro, and this is in contrast to their interactions in cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that SmgGDS-607 is involved in the alternate prenylation pathway of K-Ras in cells treated with farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs). The HEK-293T cell line was obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA). HEK-293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. All cDNAs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To inhibit prenylation, 10 μm FTI-277 (CAT344555; EMD Millipore) and GGTI-298 (CAT344555; EMD Millipore) or 15 μm mevastatin (M2537; Sigma) was added 90 min post-transfection to the cells. Human SmgGDS-558-HA and SmgGDS-607-HA constructs were generated as described previously (20Berg T.J. Gastonguay A.J. Lorimer E.L. Kuhnmuench J.R. Li R. Fields A.P. Williams C.L.

The majority of Myc-tagged GTPase constructs were generated as described previously (33Lanning C.C. Ruiz-Velasco R. Williams C.L.

Myc-K-Ras CVIM was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to change the methionine to a leucine (CVIL) and the cysteine to a serine (SVIM or SVIL) (see Fig. 1A). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols, using primers purchased from Eurofins MWG/Operon. The CAAX mutant Myc-Rap1B (CQLM) was generated by site directed mutagenesis through Top Gene Technologies (Montreal, Canada). Peptide synthesis was carried out using an automated solid phase peptide synthesizer (PS3; Protein Technologies Inc., Memphis, TN) employing standard Fmoc/1H-benzotriazolium1-[bis(dimethyl-amino)metheylene]-5-chloro-hexafluorophosphate (1-),3-oxide-based chemistry. Synthesis began on either preloaded Fmoc-M-Wang resin or Fmoc-L-Wang resin (0.25 mmol), and the peptide chain was elongated using 1H-benzotriazolium1-[bis(dimethyl-amino)metheylene]-5-chloro-hexafluorophosphate (1-),3-oxide/N-methylmorpholine-catalyzed, single coupling steps with 4 eq of both protected amino acids and HTCU for 30 min. Following complete chain elongation, the N terminus of the peptide was deprotected with 10% piperidine in DMF (v/v), and the presence of the resulting free amine was confirmed by ninhydrin analysis. The resin containing the peptide was washed with CH2Cl2, dried in vacuo overnight, weighed, and divided into two portions for further synthesis on a reduced scale. Using 0.13 mmol of peptide on resin, the free N terminus was modified with a PEG-based linker in DMF (5 ml) using Fmoc-8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (77 mg, 0.20 mmol, 1.5 eq) catalyzed by N,N-diisopropylethylamine (16.4 μl, 13.0 μmol) for 12 h. After installation of the linker and subsequent Fmoc deprotection, the resulting N terminus was biotinylated in DMF (5 ml) using biotin (49.0 mg, 0.20 mmol, 1.5 eq) and 1H-benzotriazolium1-[bis(dimethyl-amino)metheylene]-5-chloro-hexafluorophosphate (1-),3-oxide (82.7 mg, 0.20 mmol, 1.5 eq) catalyzed by N,N-diisopropylethylamine (16.4 μl, 13.0 μmol) for 16 h. After verifying the biotinylation was complete by ninhydrin analysis, the peptide was cleaved from the resin along with simultaneous side chain deprotection by treatment with reagent K containing TFA (10 ml), crystalline phenol (0.5 g), 1,2-ethanedithiol (0.25 ml), thioanisole (0.5 ml), and H2O (0.5 ml) for 2 h at room temperature. The released peptide was collected and combined with TFA washes of the resin before precipitation of the peptide in chilled Et2O (100 ml). The crude solid peptide was collected by centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the resulting pellet was washed two times with cold Et2O (50 ml), repeating the centrifugation and supernatant removal steps each time. The crude peptide (100 mg) was dissolved in a DMF/H2O solution (1:5, v/v, 25 ml), applied to a semipreparative C18 reverse phase HPLC column equilibrated in Solvent A, and washed with 10% Solvent B for 15 min. The peptide was eluted using a linear gradient (15–65% Solvent B over 1.5 h at a flow rate of 5 ml/min). Fractions were analyzed using an analytical C18 reverse phase HPLC column employing a linear gradient (0–100% Solvent B over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min) and detected at 214 nm. Fractions containing peptide product of at least 90% purity were pooled and concentrated by lyophilization to yield 35 mg (27% yield) of white peptide. The [M + 3H]3+ values for ESI-MS for Biotin-PEG-KKKKKKSKTKCVIM were 683.66 (calculated) and 683.73 (found), and those for ESI-MS for Biotin-PEG-KKKKKKSKTKCVIL were 677.56 (calculated) and 677.75 (found). Solid phase peptide synthesis and purification was carried out in the same fashion as described above starting with Fmoc-L-Wang resin (0.25 mmol). No additional derivatizations were performed after peptide chain elongation was complete. After reagent K cleavage and HPLC purification, the free thiol-containing peptide resulted in 60 mg (37% yield) of white peptide. The [M + 2H]2+ values for ESI-MS were 943.51 (calculated) and 943.68 (found). The starting free thiol peptide (20 mg, 10.6 μmol, 1 eq) was dissolved in DMF/n-butanol/H2O (0.10% TFA) (3:1:1, v/v/v, 6 ml). Farnesyl bromide (15 mg, 53.5 μmol, 5 eq) was dissolved in 0.50 ml of DMF and added directly into the reaction flask that contained the dissolved peptide. Zn(OAc)2·2H2O (11.7 mg, 53.5 μmol, 5 eq) was then added to initiate the alkylation reaction. After 4 h, the reaction was monitored by analytical reverse phase HPLC, purified by semipreparative C18 reverse phase HPLC, and identified via ESI-TOF MS. This reaction yielded 3.4 mg (19%) of the desired alkylated peptide. The [M + 2H]2+ values for ESI-MS were 1045.96 (calculated) and 1046.04 (found). Synthesis followed the same prenylation conditions as described above using geranylgeranyl bromide (19 mg, 53.5 μmol, 5 eq). This reaction yielded 2.6 mg (12%) of the desired alkylated peptide. The [M + 2H]2+ values for ESI-MS were 1079.64 (calculated) and 1079.73 (found). Synthesis followed the same prenylation conditions as described above using C10-meta-Bp-Br (22.8 mg, 53.5 μmol, 5 eq) that was prepared as previously described (34Turek T.C. Gaon I. Gamache D.

Biotin-Rap1B (C10) peptides containing a benzophenone (synthesized as described above) were cross-linked to SmgGDS-607-HA by UV light irradiation utilizing a UVGL-25 Minerallight lamp (366 nm). Peptides and HEK-293T cell lysates overexpressing SmgGDS-607-HA or HA vector were combined and incubated on ice for 10 min. Mixtures were transferred to quartz tubes and placed ∼3 cm above the UV light for increasing time points from 0–60 min. Photo-cross-linking reaction was quenched immediately after the indicated time points by placing the sample in an Eppendorf tube, which was then placed in liquid nitrogen. A control sample was prepared as described above, and the tube was wrapped in tin foil before exposure to UV light. After the cross-linking procedure, the peptides were immunoprecipitated using streptavidin-Sepharose 4B beads (434341; Invitrogen) and subjected to ECL-Western blotting. GST-K-Ras CVIM, GST-K-Ras CVIL, His-SmgGDS-607, and His-SmgGDS-588 were purified as described previously (38Maresso A.W. Barbieri J.T.

Briefly, the coding sequence of K-Ras CVIM or K-Ras CVIL was cloned into pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare), or the coding sequence of SmgGDS-607 or SmgGDS-558 was cloned into pET-28a. The constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Bacteria were plated overnight at 37 °C with ampicillin (K-Ras) or kanamycin (SmgGDS) (250 μg/ml). Cells were added to 400 ml of LB broth supplemented with either ampicillin or kanamycin and cultured for 2 h at 30 °C when 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 2 h at 30 °C. Bacterial cells expressing GST-K-Ras were harvested, suspended in glutathione-binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, bacterial protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 20 μg/ml RNase, and 20 μg/ml DNase) and lysed in a French pressure cell. The lysate was centrifuged (30,000 × g for 20 min), and the soluble fraction was passed through a 0.45-μm filter. Bacterial lysates of GST-K-Ras CVIM or CVIL were incubated with 1.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (GE Healthcare) for 30 min on a nutator at 4 °C. The slurry was centrifuged (1500 × g), and the resin was washed four times with 25 ml of binding buffer. Proteins were batch eluted three times with 1 ml of elution buffer (20 mm reduced glutathione, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1% Triton X-100). GST-K-Ras was dialyzed into 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm NaCl, and 30% glycerol, and then stored at −80 °C. Bacterial cells expressing His-SmgGDS were suspended in a binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, bacterial protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 20 μg/ml RNase, and 20 μg/ml DNase) and lysed in a French pressure cell.

https://openalex.org/W1968015724,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) initiates receptor signaling and early actin dynamics during viral entry. This process is required for viral infection of primary targets such as resting CD4 T cells. WAVE2 is a component of a multiprotein complex linking receptor signaling to dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. WAVE2 directly activates Arp2/3, leading to actin nucleation and filament branching. Although several bacterial and viral pathogens target Arp2/3 for intracellular mobility, it remains unknown whether HIV-1 actively modulates the Arp2/3 complex through virus-mediated receptor signal transduction. Here we report that HIV-1 triggers WAVE2 phosphorylation at serine 351 through gp120 binding to the chemokine coreceptor CXCR4 or CCR5 during entry. This phosphorylation event involves both Gαi-dependent and -independent pathways, and is conserved both in X4 and R5 viral infection of resting CD4 T cells and primary macrophages. We further demonstrate that inhibition of WAVE2-mediated Arp2/3 activity through stable shRNA knockdown of Arp3 dramatically diminished HIV-1 infection of CD4 T cells, preventing viral nuclear migration. Inhibition of Arp2/3 through a specific inhibitor, CK548, also drastically inhibited HIV-1 nuclear migration and infection of CD4 T cells. Our results suggest that Arp2/3 and the upstream regulator, WAVE2, are essential co-factors hijacked by HIV for intracellular migration, and may serve as novel targets to prevent HIV transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2013609428,"In heart, the type 2 inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (InsP3R2) is the predominant isoform expressed and is localized in the nuclear membrane of ventricular myocytes. InsP3R2-mediated Ca(2+) release regulates hypertrophy specific gene expression by modulating CaMKIIδ, histone deacetylase, and calcineurin-NFATc signaling pathways. InsP3R2 protein is a hypertrophy specific marker and is overexpressed in heart failure animal models and in humans. However, the regulation of InsP3R2 mRNA and protein expression during cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure is not known. Here we show the transcriptional regulation of the Itpr2 gene in adult cardiomyocytes. Our data demonstrates that, InsP3R2 mRNA and protein expression is activated by hypertrophic agonists and attenuated by InsP3R inhibitors 2-aminoethoxyldiphenyl borate and xestospongin-C. The Itpr2 promoter is regulated by the calcineurin-NFATc signaling pathway. NFATc1 regulates Itpr2 gene expression by directly binding to the Itpr2 promoter. The calcineurin-NFATc mediated up-regulation of the Itpr2 promoter was attenuated by cyclosporine-A. InsP3R2 mRNA and protein expression was up-regulated in calcineurin-A transgenic mice and in human heart failure. Collectively, our data suggests that ITPR2 and hypertrophy specific gene expression is regulated, in part, by a positive feedback regulation between InsP3R2 and calcineurin-NFATc signaling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2074832457,"Progesterone receptor (PR) exists in two isoforms, PRA and PRB, and both contain activation functions AF-1 and AF-2. It is believed that AF-1 is primarily responsible for the ligand-independent activity, whereas AF-2 mediates ligand-dependent PR activation. Although more than a dozen post-translational modifications of PR have been reported, no post-translational modification on AF-1 or AF-2 has been reported. Using LC-MS/MS-based proteomic analysis, this study revealed AF-1 monomethylation at Lys-464. Mutational analysis revealed the remarkable importance of Lys-464 in regulating PR activity. Single point mutation K464Q or K464A led to ligand-independent PR gel upshift similar to the ligand-induced gel upshift. This upshift was associated with increases in both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent PR phosphorylation and PR activity due to the hyperactivation of AF-1. In contrast, mutation of Lys-464 to the bulkier phenylalanine to mimic the effect of methylation caused a drastic decrease in PR activity. Importantly, PR-K464Q also showed heightened ligand sensitivity, and this was associated with increases in its functional interaction with transcription co-regulators NCoR1 and SRC-1. These results suggest that monomethylation of PR at Lys-464 probably has a repressive effect on AF-1 activity and ligand sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2006756337,"Liver gluconeogenesis is essential to provide energy to glycolytic tissues during fasting periods. However, aberrant up-regulation of this metabolic pathway contributes to the progression of glucose intolerance in individuals with diabetes. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression plays a critical role in the modulation of gluconeogenesis. Several pathways contribute to the regulation of PEPCK, including the nuclear receptor Rev-erbα and the histone deacetylase SIRT1. Deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) is a nuclear protein that binds to and regulates both Rev-erbα and SIRT1 and, therefore, is a candidate to participate in the regulation of PEPCK. In this work, we provide evidence that DBC1 regulates glucose metabolism and the expression of PEPCK. We show that DBC1 levels decrease early in the fasting state. Also, DBC1 KO mice display higher gluconeogenesis in a normal and a high-fat diet. DBC1 absence leads to an increase in PEPCK mRNA and protein expression. Conversely, overexpression of DBC1 results in a decrease in PEPCK mRNA and protein levels. DBC1 regulates the levels of Rev-erbα, and manipulation of Rev-erbα activity or levels prevents the effect of DBC1 on PEPCK. In addition, Rev-erbα levels decrease in the first hours of fasting. Finally, knockdown of the deacetylase SIRT1 eliminates the effect of DBC1 knockdown on Rev-erbα levels and PEPCK expression, suggesting that the mechanism of PEPCK regulation is, at least in part, dependent on the activity of this enzyme.

PinX1 interacts with TRF1, but the physiological consequences of their interaction in telomere protection are not yet understood. Here we investigated PinX1 function on TRF1 stability in HeLa cells. PinX1 overexpression stabilized TRF1, but PinX1 depletion by siRNA led to TRF1 degradation, TRF1 ubiquitination, and less TRF1 telomere association. The depletion also induced DNA damage responses at telomeres and chromosome instability. These telomere dysfunctional phenotypes were in fact due to TRF1 deficiency. We also report that hTERT, a catalytic component of telomerase, plays dual roles in the TRF1 steady state pathway. PinX1-mediated TRF1 stability was not observed in hTERT-negative immortal cells, but was pronounced when hTERT was ectopically expressed in the cells, suggesting that hTERT may be needed in the PinX1-mediated TRF1 stability pathway. Interestingly, the knockdown of both PinX1 and hTERT in HeLa cells stabilized TRF1, suppressed DNA damage response activation, and restored chromosome stability. In summary, our findings suggested that PinX1 may maintain telomere integrity by regulating TRF1 stability and that hTERT may act as both a positive and a negative regulator of TRF1 homeostasis in a PinX1-dependent manner."

To identify novel markers of AI responsiveness, a genome-wide microarray analysis was performed using primary breast tumor samples from 50 postmenopausal women who later developed metastatic breast cancer. Sushi domain containing 3 (SUSD3) is a significantly differentially expressed gene, with 3.38-fold higher mRNA levels in AI-responsive breast tumors vs non-responders (P<0.001). SUSD3 was highly expressed in ERα-positive breast tumors and treatment with estradiol increased SUSD3 expression in ERα-positive breast cancer cells. Treatment with an antiestrogen or ERα knockdown abolished basal and estradiol-dependent SUSD3 expression. Recruitment of ERα upstream of the transcription start site of SUSD3 was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR. Flow cytometric analysis of SUSD3-knockdown cells revealed blunted estradiol effects on progression into S and M phases. SUSD3 was localized to the plasma membrane of breast cancer cells. SUSD3 knockdown decreased the appearance of actin-rich protrusions, stress fibers and large basal focal adhesions, while increasing the presence of cortical actin concomitant with a decrease in Rho and focal adhesion kinase activity. SUSD3-deficient cells demonstrated diminished cell spreading, cell-cell adhesion and motility. In conclusion, SUSD3 is a novel promoter of estrogen-dependent cell proliferation and regulator of cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions and migration in breast cancer. It may serve as a novel predictor of response to endocrine therapy and potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1983921361,"Dpo4 and Dbh are from two closely related Sulfolobus species and are well studied archaeal homologues of pol IV, an error prone Y-family polymerase from Escherichia coli. Despite sharing 54% amino acid identity, these polymerases display distinct mutagenic and translesion specificities. Structurally, Dpo4 and Dbh adopt different conformations because of the difference in relative orientation of their N-terminal catalytic and C-terminal DNA binding domains. Using chimeric constructs of these two polymerases, we have previously demonstrated that the interdomain linker is a major determinant of polymerase conformation, base-substitution fidelity, and abasic-site translesion synthesis. Here we find that the interdomain linker also affects the single-base deletion frequency and the mispair extension efficiency of these polymerases. Exchanging just three amino acids in the linkers of Dbh and Dpo4 is sufficient to change the fidelity by up to 30-fold, predominantly by altering the rate of correct (but not incorrect) nucleotide incorporation. Additionally, from a 2.4 Å resolution crystal structure, we have found that the three linker amino acids from Dpo4 are sufficient to allow Dbh to adopt the standard conformation of Dpo4. Thus, a small region of the interdomain linker, located more than 11 Å away from the catalytic residues, determines the fidelity of these Y-family polymerases, by controlling the alignment of substrates at the active site."
