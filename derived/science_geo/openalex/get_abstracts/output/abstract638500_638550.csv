Caloric excess, frequent in the Western world, has been linked to systemic low-grade chronic inflammation (Lumeng and Saltiel, 2011Lumeng C.N. Saltiel A.R.

Although little data is available on the effect of caloric restriction on inflammation in normal-weight individuals, prior studies have shown that individuals undergoing intermittent or religious fasting have reduced basal levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β (Aksungar et al., 2007Aksungar F.B.

Med. 2016; 14: 290Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Prompted by these prior results, we sought to investigate the impact of fasting on immune cell homeostasis. We first used mass cytometry to profile blood circulating cells of healthy, normal-weight humans prior to and during fasting. Strikingly, we discovered that fasting significantly reduced the number of circulating monocytes and similar results were obtained in mice. Here we describe how dietary energy intake controls the quality and quantity of blood and tissue monocytes emphasizing the link between high calorie dietary patterns and inflammatory disease outcome in patients. To explore whether fasting was associated with changes in peripheral blood leukocyte populations, we profiled the composition of blood circulating immune cells of 12 healthy normal weight volunteers (mean age = 30 ± 5 years, BMI = 22 ± 2 kg/m2) 3 h after food intake (fed state) and after 19 h of fasting (fasting state) using cytometry by time-of-flight spectrometry (CyTOF) (Figures 1A and 1B ). To control for circadian variations, all blood samples were drawn at the same time of the day (3 pm). Strikingly, we found that fasting led to significant reduction of circulating monocytes including both CD14+ and CD16+ monocyte subsets (Figures 1C and 1D and S1A). Interestingly, in individuals with low baseline monocyte numbers, fasting did not decrease monocyte numbers below the physiologic range (Figure 1D). In addition to monocytes, a small subset of circulating dendritic cells, called CD141+ DC, was also reduced, whereas neutrophils were not significantly affected during short term fasting (Figure 1E).Figure S1Profiling of Leukocyte Populations in the Fed and the Fasting State in Healthy Humans and in Mice.

We then asked whether similar changes in blood monocyte numbers also occurred in fasting mice. We chose a 4 h short-term fasting protocol during the light period (Zeitgeber [ZT]2-6) which is comparable to overnight fasting for humans and is the least stressful fasting strategy in animals (Figure S1B) (Jensen et al., 2013Jensen T.L. Kiersgaard M.K. Sørensen D.B. Mikkelsen L.F. Fasting of mice: a review.Lab. Anim. 2013; 47: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Within 4 h, mice eat up to 0.5g of chow (0.2g on average) representing ∼7% of their total 24 h food intake (Figure 1F). Intriguingly, while the frequencies of most immune cell clusters were unaffected by short-term fasting, Ly-6Chigh pro-inflammatory monocytes were strongly reduced (Figures 1G and 1H). Ly-6Clow patrolling monocytes were proportionally reduced at 4 h and reduction in absolute numbers reached significance after 20 h of fasting. Prolonged fasting periods (20 h [ZT10-6], 48 h [ZT6-6]) reduced additional peripheral leukocyte populations including eosinophils, NK cells and T cells (Figures S1C and S1D). Importantly, fasting also led to significant reduction of pro-inflammatory Ly-6Chigh monocytes in peripheral tissues including the peritoneal cavity, lung, liver, spleen and adipose tissues (Figures 1J, S1E and S1F). Decreased numbers of circulating monocytes in fasting mice could be due to increased monocyte cell death, reduced bone marrow (BM) myelopoiesis, or reduced BM egress to the periphery. We did not detect an increased number of activated caspase-positive monocytes suggesting that the reduction of peripheral monocytes in fasting mice may not be due to increased cell death (Figure 1K). We also failed to detect decreased numbers of BM CXCR4+ monocyte precursors (Chong et al., 2016Chong S.Z. Evrard M. Devi S. Chen J. Lim J.Y. See P. Zhang Y. Adrover J.M. Lee B. Tan L. et al.CXCR4 identifies transitional bone marrow premonocytes that replenish the mature monocyte pool for peripheral responses.J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213: 2293-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Figure 1L). Instead, Ly-6Chigh monocytes accumulated in the BM of fasting mice (Figure 1M) suggesting that fasting–induced reduction of blood monocytes is due to reduced monocyte egress from the BM to the blood circulation. An important mechanism controlling BM cell egress is neuronal stimulation of β3 adrenergic receptors (β3-AR) on BM stromal cells, which leads to reduced BM CXCL12 production and release of hematopoietic cells into the blood circulation (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2008Méndez-Ferrer S. Lucas D. Battista M. Frenette P.S. Haematopoietic stem cell release is regulated by circadian oscillations.Nature. 2008; 452: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Injection of the β3-AR agonist CL 316,243 into fasting mice partially rescued monocyte egress, but never to the same extent as in fed mice, indicating the existence of additional mechanisms suppressing egress during fasting (Figure S1G). CXCL12 BM levels were not affected by fasting suggesting that CXCL12 does not mediate fasting-induced monocyte accumulation in the BM (Figure S1H). In addition, circadian fluctuations in monocyte release or forced shifts in circadian rhythm (jetlag) did not affect fasting ability to modulate BM monocyte egress (Figures S1I, S1J, and S1K). Re-feeding mice for 4 h after an overnight fast restored monocyte numbers in the periphery (Figure S1L), showing that fasting-induced inhibition of BM egress is revoked upon food intake. Fasting withdraws both dietary macronutrients (digestible carbohydrates, protein, fat) as well as essential micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, non-digestible fiber). Removal of macronutrients from the diet was sufficient to reduce the pool of circulating monocytes (Figure 2A). Conversely, oral gavage of fasting mice with isocaloric amounts of carbohydrates and proteins, but not fat, rescued circulating monocyte numbers in the blood (Figure 2B). Importantly, the size of the monocyte pool in the blood circulation depended on the amount of carbohydrate ingested (Figure 2C). Carbohydrate and protein intake stimulate insulin secretion, prompting us to examine the contribution of insulin in the regulation of BM monocyte egress. Genetic deletion of the insulin receptor gene in monocytes (Figure 2D) or exogenous insulin administration in fasting mice (Figure 2E) did not affect peripheral blood monocyte numbers suggesting that insulin was not responsible for BM monocyte egress. We thus hypothesized that carbohydrates and proteins might modulate peripheral monocyte numbers by altering cellular energy levels. To address this hypothesis, we used two different inhibitors of hexokinase, 2-deoxyglucose, and D-mannoheptulose, in order to block the first step in glycolysis, i.e., cellular energy production (Figures 2F and S2). Interestingly, blocking glycolysis reduced monocyte numbers to levels similar to those observed during fasting, suggesting that cellular energy levels controlled the blood circulating monocyte pool. Mammalian 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key cellular energy sensor triggered by an increase in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio that reflects low energy levels. Phenformin is known to elevate the cellular AMP/ATP ratio which results in AMPK activation. Strikingly, we found that phenformin administration significantly reduced monocyte egress in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2G). To further examine the contribution of AMPK to the regulation of blood monocyte levels we gavaged mice with a small molecule activator of AMPK (A-769662) (Figure 2H). Consistent with the data obtained with phenformin administration, we found that oral gavage with A-769662 significantly reduced the pool of blood peripheral monocytes in fed mice. Altogether these results suggest that activation of the low-energy sensor AMPK is sufficient to inhibit BM monocyte egress to the blood circulation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) is a target of several nutrient-sensing pathways including AMPK and is a master transcriptional regulator in the adaptive response to fasting. PPARα has been implicated in the anti-inflammatory effects of fasting (Wang et al., 2016Wang A. Huen S.C. Luan H.H. Yu S. Zhang C. Gallezot J.D. Booth C.J. Medzhitov R.

Kanneganti T.D. et al.The ketone metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate blocks NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammatory disease.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we found that fasting-induced reduction of circulating monocytes was less efficient in Ppara−/− mice compared to wild-type mice suggesting that activation of PPARα contributed to the regulation of monocyte homeostasis during fasting (Figure 3A). Phenformin treatment had a much more pronounced effect in Ppara+/+ mice compared to Ppara−/− mice, indicating that AMPK-mediated reduction in peripheral monocyte numbers in fasting mice was in part mediated through PPARα (Figure 3B). To determine whether PPARα mediated its effect on immune cell homeostasis by acting directly in monocytes, we generated bone marrow chimeric animals in which wild-type or Ppara−/− bone marrow cells were injected into lethally irradiated hosts (Figure 3C). Interestingly, whereas monocyte egress was reduced in fasting wild-type mice reconstituted with Ppara−/− BM, we failed to observe a significant reduction of blood monocytes in fasting Ppara−/− mice reconstituted with wild-type BM, thus establishing that the control of BM monocyte egress required PPARα expression in non-hematopoietic cells and not in monocytes. PPARα is expressed at higher levels in the liver (Figure S3A) and acts mainly in hepatocytes (Brocker et al., 2017Brocker C.N. Yue J. Kim D. Qu A. Bonzo J.A. Gonzalez F.J. Hepatocyte-specific PPARA expression exclusively promotes agonist-induced cell proliferation without influence from nonparenchymal cells.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2017; 312: G283-G299Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), prompting us to probe the role of hepatic PPARα in the control of peripheral monocyte numbers. Strikingly, we found that mice in which PPARα was deleted uniquely in hepatocytes were impaired in their ability to modulate BM monocyte egress upon fasting (Figures 3D and S3B). Since modulation of BM monocyte egress upon fasting required hepatic PPARα, we tested whether AMPK sensing of low-energy levels also occurred in hepatocytes. Importantly, we found that deletion of AMPK specifically in hepatocytes abrogated the reduction of circulating monocyte numbers upon gavage with an AMPK activator (Figure 3E). Altogether, these data establish that energy-sensing by the liver AMPK-PPARα pathway controls the blood monocyte pool in response to caloric intake. Consistent with this idea, transcriptional analysis of hepatocytes isolated after 4 h and 12 h of fasting revealed that most differentially expressed genes were involved in metabolic processes (Figures 3F and 3G) with the top transcriptional regulator at both time-points being PPARα (p value 3.09 × 10−25 and 1.16 × 10−46 at 4 h and 12 h, respectively). Genes involved in lipid metabolism were strongly modulated upon short-term fasting (p value range from 4 × 10−6-1.27 × 10−25) (Figures 3H and 3I) prompting us to examine whether metabolic adaptation to the fasting state played a role in the suppression of monocyte egress. However, we found that global triglyceride and ketone body levels as well as levels of most individual metabolites tested were unaffected by short-term fasting (Figures 3J, 3K, S3C and S3D). In addition, a ketogenic diet driving lipid metabolism failed to affect peripheral monocyte numbers (Figure 3L). We also interfered with fasting-induced lipid mobilization from fat depots by deleting FGF21 expression in liver, but could not detect any changes in monocyte numbers in fasting Fgf21−/− mice compared to littermate controls (Figure 3M). In summary, these data suggest that lipid metabolites do not play a major role in the regulation of BM monocyte egress. Transition from the fed to the fasting state involves changes in the plasma levels of numerous metabolic hormones. Short-term fasting induced remarkably similar changes in the plasma hormonal profile of humans and mice with increased levels of ghrelin and decreased levels of insulin, c-peptide, amylin, GIP, leptin, PP, and PYY (Figures 4A and S4A). Most interestingly, CCL2 (also known as MCP-1) plasma level was reduced in 8 out of 12 fasting human subjects. CCL2 binds to CCR2, a chemotactic receptor highly expressed on monocytes and shown to mediate monocyte BM egress (Serbina and Pamer, 2006Serbina N.V. Pamer E.G. Monocyte emigration from bone marrow during bacterial infection requires signals mediated by chemokine receptor CCR2.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). We also found a strong reduction of systemic CCL2 in fasting mice (Figures 4A and 4B) as well as upon administration of AMPK-activator phenformin (Figure 4C). Importantly, restoring plasma CCL2 levels through administration of recombinant protein rescued monocyte numbers in fasting mice (Figure 4D), further indicating CCL2 critical role in monocyte homeostasis during fasting. Providing glucose in fasting Ccr2−/− mice failed to elevate blood monocyte numbers and thus did not bypass Ccr2-deficiency (Figure S4B).Figure S4PPARα Controls Steady-state Blood and Tissue CCL2 Levels.

Here we show that, in the mammalian small intestine, the expression of Hmgcs2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthetase 2), the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of ketone bodies, including beta-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), distinguishes self-renewing Lgr5+ stem cells (ISCs) from differentiated cell types. Hmgcs2 loss depletes βOHB levels in Lgr5+ ISCs and skews their differentiation toward secretory cell fates, which can be rescued by exogenous βOHB and class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor treatment. Mechanistically, βOHB acts by inhibiting HDACs to reinforce Notch signaling, instructing ISC self-renewal and lineage decisions. Notably, although a high-fat ketogenic diet elevates ISC function and post-injury regeneration through βOHB-mediated Notch signaling, a glucose-supplemented diet has the opposite effects. These findings reveal how control of βOHB-activated signaling in ISCs by diet helps to fine-tune stem cell adaptation in homeostasis and injury."

Here, we performed genome-scale CRISPR screens in CD8 T cells directly under cancer immunotherapy settings and identified regulators of tumor infiltration and degranulation. The in vivo screen robustly re-identified canonical immunotherapy targets such as PD-1 and Tim-3, along with genes that have not been characterized in T cells. The infiltration and degranulation screens converged on an RNA helicase Dhx37. Dhx37 knockout enhanced the efficacy of antigen-specific CD8 T cells against triple-negative breast cancer in vivo. Immunological characterization in mouse and human CD8 T cells revealed that DHX37 suppresses effector functions, cytokine production, and T cell activation. Transcriptomic profiling and biochemical interrogation revealed a role for DHX37 in modulating NF-κB.

Given the complexity of physiological cues, it is critical to perform in vivo screens to better identify clinically relevant targets. High-throughput in vivo CRISPR screens in primary CD8 T cells would enable rapid identification of negative regulators of T cell anti-tumor function, thereby providing potential targets for immunotherapy. In this study, we performed in vivo genome-scale CRISPR screens in CD8 T cells for tumor infiltration in mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our screen re-discovered prime immunotherapy targets such as PD-1 and Tim-3, as well as previously undocumented targets. We also performed an orthogonal screen to identify factors that modulate CD8 T cell degranulation ability. The screens converged on a small number of hits that included Dhx37, a previously uncharacterized target in T cells. We subsequently interrogated the function of Dhx37/DHX37 in both mouse and human CD8 T cells. Our data revealed that Dhx37 suppresses CD8 T cell activity in response to antigenic stimulation. Biochemical experiments along with transcriptome profiling revealed that DHX37 interacts with both nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65 and PDCD11 and modulates NF-κB pathway activity in CD8 T cells. We designed and generated a lentiviral CRISPR vector that contains an sgRNA expression cassette and Thy1.1 (STAR Methods) (Figure 1A). Next, we cloned into this vector a mouse genome-scale single guide RNA (sgRNA) library (MKO) containing 128,209 gene-specific sgRNAs and 1,000 non-targeting controls (NTCs) (Table S1). We generated lentivirus from this library (Figures 1A and 1B) (STAR Methods), which enabled T cell CRISPR screens. To set up a model system for T cell immunotherapy screens, we utilized E0771 cells, a murine TNBC line, as a transplant tumor model (Figure 1B). To enable T cell recognition of cognate antigen in cancer cells, we generated clonal E0771 cell lines that constitutively express chicken ovalbumin (OVA) (STAR Methods) (Figure 1C). Using an antibody that recognizes the SIINFEKL: H-2Kb complex (Porgador et al., 1997Porgador A. Yewdell J.W. Deng Y. Bennink J.R. Germain R.N. Localization, quantitation, and in situ detection of specific peptide-MHC class I complexes using a monoclonal antibody.Immunity. 1997; 6: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), we confirmed that the SIINFEKL epitope of OVA was presented on surface H-2Kb (Figure 1C). Clone 3 of E0771-mCherry-OVA (E0771-mCh-OVA) cell lines was chosen for further studies because it presented a low-level, single-peak SIINFEKL: H-2Kb (Figure 1C). We then isolated naive CD8+ T cells from OT-I;Cas9 mice, cultured for 3 days, and then adoptively transferred these cells into Rag1-deficient mice (Figure S1A). Prior to adoptive transfer, these cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and found to have upregulated the T cell activation markers, CD44 and CD69 (Figures S1B and S1C). 7 days post-transfer, spleens were isolated and CD8+ T cells were purified and co-cultured with either E0771 or E0771-mCh-OVA cells in the presence of CD107a antibody, a granule-specific marker that is transiently deposited on the surface of T cells in response to antigenic stimulation (Betts et al., 2003Betts M.R. Brenchley J.M. Price D.A. De Rosa S.C. Douek D.C. Roederer M. Koup R.A. Sensitive and viable identification of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells by a flow cytometric assay for degranulation.J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 281: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), to quantitatively measure the degree of T cell degranulation (degranulation assay) (STAR Methods) (Figure S1D). We found that the transferred OT-I;Cas9 CD8 T cells degranulated in the presence of OVA, demonstrating that the transferred T cells retained antigenic specificity (Figure S1E). To determine whether the observed anti-tumor responses were OVA specific, we performed an in vivo experiment using E0771 cells or E0771-mCh-OVA cells transplanted into the mammary fat pad of Rag1−/− female mice. After 10 days, these mice were treated with either PBS or OT-I;Cas9 CD8 T cells (Figure S1F). We found that tumor regression occurred only in mice bearing E0771-mCh-OVA tumors treated with OT-I;Cas9 CD8+ T cells but not in the groups treated with either PBS or in mice carrying E0771 tumors (Figure S1G). Together, these data confirmed the antigenic specificity of this model system, providing a normalized baseline for in vivo genetic screens in primary CD8 T cells. We then performed the in vivo T cell tumor infiltration screen (Figure 1B), using a mammary fat pad orthotopic tumor model (Figure 1D), as well as a subcutaneous model in parallel (Figures S2A and S2B) (STAR Methods). We transduced CD8+ T cells from OT-I;Cas9 mice with the MKO sgRNA library and adoptively transferred them into E0771-OVA tumor-bearing mice bearing tumors (STAR Methods). In both orthotopic and subcutaneous models, we observed that T cell injections (either vector or MKO transduced) mitigated tumor growth and that the MKO transduced population had a stronger therapeutic effect compared to vector control (Figure 1D). Histological and pathological analysis revealed the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from mice receiving adoptive transfer but not in PBS-treated mice (Figure S2B). Flow cytometric analysis of single-cell suspensions of spleens, lymph nodes, and tumors also detected adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells (Figure S2C). Tumors from a cohort of mice were subjected to high-throughput sgRNA library sequencing (STAR Methods), which revealed the sgRNA representations of MKO transduced OT-I;Cas9 CD8 T cells before injection and in all tumor samples (Table S1; Figures S2D and S2E). While the library representation of pre-injected T cells follows a log-normal distribution for both gene-targeting sgRNAs and NTCs, the sgRNA representation in organs is characterized by the dominance of a small fraction of sgRNAs (Figure S2D). At the individual mouse level, we found that the sgRNA representation between different mice are correlated with each other (Figure S2E). Using stringent criteria (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.5%), we identified significantly enriched sgRNAs in each tumor (STAR Methods). A composite of multiple ranking approaches, including sgRNA abundance, multiple independent sgRNAs and multiple mouse replicates (STAR Methods), revealed rank lists of top scoring sgRNAs and genes (Figure 1E; Figures S3A ad S3B). The infiltration screen revealed high-rank genes representing three classes of genes: immune regulators, growth controlling genes, and largely uncharacterized genes (Figures 1E–1G; Figures S3A and S3B). A total of 6 genes were significantly enriched with all three criteria fulfilled (Cd247, Fam103a1, Hacvr2/Tim-3, Pdcd1/PD-1, Prkar1a, and Stradb) (Figure 1E). To further assess the robustness of screen performance, we first applied RIGER (STAR Methods), an analysis method considering the performance of multiple sgRNAs for the same gene. RIGER analysis with the 2nd-best sgRNA method revealed 13 genes at top-level statistical significance (p ≤ 1e-4) (Figure 1F), while the weighted-sum method scored 7 genes at top significance (Figure S3C), where 6 of them were shared with the 2nd-best sgRNA method. In fact, these six genes (Cd247, Fam103a1, Hacvr2, Pdcd1, Prkar1a, and Stradb) are exactly identical to the 3-way shared hits identified by our custom FDR method. We also performed a parallel analysis with MAGeCK, a model-based algorithm for genome-scale CRISPR screens (Li et al., 2014Li W. Xu H. Xiao T. Cong L. Love M.I. Zhang F. Irizarry R.A. Liu J.S. Brown M. Liu X.S. MAGeCK enables robust identification of essential genes from genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens.Genome Biol. 2014; 15: 554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which again revealed Stradb, Pdcd1, Prkar1a, and Fam103a1 on top of the list (Figure 1G; Figure S3D). Examination of individual genes revealed strongly depleted sgRNAs targeting essential genes (e.g., Hist1h4d) and enriched sgRNAs targeting known or potentially new T cell phenotype modulators (Figure 1H). PD-1 and Tim-3 are well-known immunotherapy targets, thereby benchmarking the success and technical rigor of the screen. Collectively, these analyses demonstrate the rigor of in vivo CRISPR screen for CD8 T cell tumor infiltration and revealed targets for cancer immunotherapy. We set out to independently identify genes that could modulate the ability of CD8 T cells to kill cancer cells. We performed a screen using degranulation assay (Figure 2A). We pulsed E0771 cells with varying concentrations of SIINFEKL peptide and found that they presented SIINFEKL peptide on surface MHC-I in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B). We isolated naive OT-I;Cas9 CD8 T cells and transduced them with MKO library, stimulated them for 6 days, rested them for 12 h, and then co-cultured them with SIINFEKL-pulsed E0771 cells at 1:1 of T cell: cancer cell (Effector: Target, or E: T) ratio in the presence of CD107a antibody (STAR Methods) (Betts et al., 2003Betts M.R. Brenchley J.M. Price D.A. De Rosa S.C. Douek D.C. Roederer M. Koup R.A. Sensitive and viable identification of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells by a flow cytometric assay for degranulation.J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 281: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). With three biological replicates, we sorted the top 5% CD107a+ cells (Figure 2C) and then subjected them to screen readout and data analysis (STAR Methods). Using the FDR <0.5% significance cutoff, we identified significantly enriched sgRNAs and their corresponding genes (Figure 2D), which represented potential negative regulators of T cell degranulation. Three genes emerged as common hits between the degranulation screen and the tumor infiltration screen (Dhx37, Lyn, and Odc1) (Figure 2E). To examine the function of these genes in a model of immunotherapy, we cloned sgRNAs targeting Dhx37 and Odc1 that scored in both screens, along with Pdcd1 (which only scored in the infiltration screen) into the T cell lentiviral CRISPR vector. We did not pursue Lyn because it is not normally expressed in T cells (Tsantikos et al., 2009Tsantikos E. Quilici C. Harder K.W. Wang B. Zhu H.J. Anderson G.P. Tarlinton D.M. Hibbs M.L.

USA. 1989; 86: 6538-6542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then prepared lentivirus, transduced T cells, and adoptively transferred them into mice bearing E0771-mCh-OVA tumors (STAR Methods). Despite initially growing for 3 days post-adoptive transfer, the tumors treated by adoptive T cells regressed over the following 2.5 weeks (Figures 2F and 2G). All OT-I;Cas9 CD8 T cell-treatment groups demonstrated strong anti-tumor effects beginning 7 days after adoptive transfer (Figure 2G). Notably, sgDhx37 infected OT-I;Cas9 CD8 T cells significantly suppressed relapse when compared to mice treated with vector-infected T cells (Figure 2G). We observed that (5/5, 100%) of the mice in the sgDhx37 group had smaller tumors as compared to the vector group, compared to 2/5 in sgPdcd1 and 3/5 in sgOdc1 groups (Figure 2H).

Memory T cell homing to BM during DR was associated with enhanced protection against infections and tumors. Together, this work uncovers a fundamental host strategy to sustain and optimize immunological memory during nutritional challenges that involved a temporal and spatial reorganization of the memory pool within “safe haven” compartments. Host survival depends on the ability to adapt to challenges in a way that sustains and protects fundamental physiological processes. Immunological memory is a cardinal feature of the adaptive immune system, which confers a survival advantage by allowing the host to rapidly and effectively control subsequent challenges. Such responses rely on the ability of memory T cells to persist long term, which can be divided into circulating and resident subsets. Circulating cells include central, effector, and peripheral memory T cells (TCM, TEM, and TPM) (Gerlach et al., 2016Gerlach C. Moseman E.A. Loughhead S.M. Alvarez D. Zwijnenburg A.J. Waanders L.

However, these long-lived cells are faced with numerous challenges throughout the life of the host, including their persistence and maintenance of protective function during stress and reduced nutritional availability. Indeed, food accessibility was and can remain highly contingent on encounters with distinct environments and climatic conditions. Thus, mechanisms may have evolved to ensure that the host can adapt and thrive in situations where calories and nutrients are limited. Of interest, caloric restriction or dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to promote various aspects of host fitness, including the improvement of metabolic profiles, prevention of cellular aging, and reduced incidence of cancer (Nikolich-Zugich and Messaoudi, 2005Nikolich-Zugich J.

However, the consequence of DR on the memory T cell compartment remains to be addressed. Due to the importance of memory T cells for host survival, defined strategies or compensatory mechanisms may be in place to sustain these cells in the context of nutritional challenges. Of relevance, we and others have found that white adipose tissue (WAT) is a reservoir for memory T cells (Han et al., 2017Han S.J. Glatman Zaretsky A. Andrade-Oliveira V. Collins N. Dzutsev A. Shaik J. Morais da Fonseca D. Harrison O.J. Tamoutounour S.

Vezys V. Marzo A.L. Lefrançois L. Preferential localization of effector memory cells in nonlymphoid tissue.Science. 2001; 291: 2413-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). While WAT is reduced during DR, the bone marrow (BM) paradoxically shows increased adipogenesis in this context (Cawthorn et al., 2014Cawthorn W.P. Scheller E.L. Learman B.S. Parlee S.D. Simon B.R. Mori H. Ning X. Bree A.J. Schell B.

Res. 2010; 25: 2078-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These observations raised the possibility that an alliance between defined tissue compartments may serve the purpose of preserving immunological memory in the face of nutritional challenges. Here, we show that DR induces a whole-body response, resulting in the collapse of circulating memory T cell populations in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) and blood but enhanced accumulation in BM. Such a response was associated with profound remodeling of the BM compartment, with increases in adipocytes and T cell trophic factors. The ability of memory T cells to accumulate in BM not only protected the memory pool from inhospitable conditions during DR, but also optimized their function in the face of secondary challenges. Altogether, this work uncovers a fundamental host strategy to adapt to physiological nutritional challenges, which are associated with a temporal and spatial reorganization of the memory pool within “safe haven” tissue compartments. To assess the fate of memory T cells in the context of a transient reduction in nutrition, mice were placed on DR, which involved receiving 50% of their daily food intake. This resulted in approximately 10%–15% weight loss (Figure S1A) and a reduction in fat mass (Figure S1B) after 1 week, followed by a plateau (Figures S1A and S1B). DR caused a decrease in SLO cellularity (Figure S1C), resulting in a decrease in number of antigen-experienced CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Figures 1A, S1D, and S1E), as well as regulatory T cells (Treg), natural killer (NK) cells, and mature B cells (Figures S1D and S1F–S1H). A similar decrease was observed in blood and WAT (Figures 1A and S1E–S1H). Thus, DR is associated with a rapid and profound collapse of antigen-experienced T cells in the periphery, raising the possibility that memory T cells may redistribute to a distinct niche under these conditions.Figure 1Memory T Cells Accumulate in BM during DRShow full caption(A) Number of CD8+ CD44+ T cells in spleen (spl), cervical lymph node (cLN), blood, and gonadal adipose tissue (GAT) over time during 50% DR.(B) Number of CD8+ CD44+ T cells in femur BM of mice on DR over time.(C) Confocal microscopy of CD4+ (magenta) and CD8+ (yellow) T cells in BM after 3 weeks of DR.(D) Number of CD8+ CD44+ T cells in BM from tibia, skull, thoracic vertebrate, humerus, and ilium of mice on DR for 3–6 weeks.(E) Mice were infected and 4 weeks later put on DR for 4–6 weeks.(F and G) (F) Number of memory CD8+ T cells in GAT, spl, and BM specific for the YopE antigen of Yersinia pseudotuberculolsis or (G) the nucleoprotein antigen of influenza A virus after 4–6 weeks of DR.(H) Number of CD8+ CD44+ T cells in BM and spl of mice fed the indicated diet ad libitum or at 50% restriction for 3 weeks.(I) Number of CD8+ CD44+ T cells in BM and spl of mice on DR for 3 weeks or on DR for 3 weeks then refed ad libitum for a further 1 or 3 week(s).Each symbol represents an individual mouse.

See also Figure S1. In contrast to other compartments examined, antigen-experienced CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were significantly increased in BM during DR (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1E). Lymphocyte redistribution occurred by 1 week following the initiation of DR and was stable for at least 6 weeks (Figure 1B). Accumulation of antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells occurred across the entire BM compartment, with an increase of T cells observed in BM from the femur, tibia, skull, vertebrate, humerus, and ilium during DR (Figures 1B–1D). Such an increase was selective to memory T cells, as the number of Treg, NK cells, mature B cells, and plasma cells in BM was preserved during DR but not increased (Figures S1F–S1I). To determine whether memory T cells induced following infection redistributed during DR, we tracked antigen-specific responses following an oral infection with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ΔyopM (Yptb ΔyopM) (Han et al., 2017Han S.J. Glatman Zaretsky A. Andrade-Oliveira V. Collins N. Dzutsev A. Shaik J. Morais da Fonseca D. Harrison O.J. Tamoutounour S.

Following pathogen clearance and the establishment of memory (4 weeks), mice were placed on DR (Figure 1E), showing that these pathogen-specific memory CD8+ T cells were reduced in spleen and WAT but found at higher numbers in BM during DR (Figures 1F and 1G). We next assessed whether a reduction in calories alone was responsible for memory T cell redistribution during DR or if defined nutrients played a role. To this end, we designed diets that when given at 50% restriction would contain normalized levels of vitamins and minerals (V&M), essential amino acids (EAA), or total protein. Normalizing V&M, EAA, or total protein still induced memory T cell redistribution to BM, while reducing calories alone was sufficient to drive the response (Figure 1H). Further, accumulation of memory T cells in BM during DR was reversible, with the steady-state number rapidly restored in BM and spleen upon refeeding (Figure 1I). Collectively, these results indicate that memory T cells collapse in SLO and blood but rapidly and reversibly accumulate in the BM compartment in response to a reduction in calories. Several memory T cell populations exist and are characterized by distinct migratory patterns and functional potential. DR induced a decrease in the memory T cell subsets found in SLO and WAT (Figure 2A). In contrast, the number of TCM and TEM was significantly increased in BM during DR, whereas T cells expressing a TRM or TPM phenotype were sustained (Figures 2B and S2A). The expression of the canonical memory markers CD127 (interleukin [IL]-7Rα), CD122 (IL-2Rβ/IL-15Rβ), CD25 (IL-2Rα), and CD62L (L-selectin), and transcription factors T-BET and EOMES, was similar between TCM and TEM from mice fed ad libitum or on DR (Figures S2B–S2G). Thus, DR preferentially promoted the accumulation of TCM and TEM in the BM.Figure S2Phenotypic Analysis of Memory T Cells during DR, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Number of CD44+ CX3CR1int.

Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. CD8+ T cells (isolated ex vivo or pre-activated in vitro) intravenously transferred into recipient mice on DR were found at reduced numbers in the spleen but were increased in BM compared to mice fed ad libitum (Figures 2C and S2H), supporting the idea that BM accumulation was the result of cellular redistribution. In line with this, memory T cells in BM during DR did not show increased levels of homeostatic proliferation (Figure S2I). In fact, the rate of proliferation during DR was significantly lower as compared to mice fed ad libitum (Figure S2I). On the other hand, memory T cells vigorously proliferated when mice on DR were re-fed ad libitum, which was particularly pronounced in the TCM subset (Figure S2I). As such, TCM may be critical to restore the memory T cell compartment following the restoration of calories. The major function of circulating memory T cells is immunosurveillance. To assess whether circulating memory T cells permanently accumulated in BM during DR or if they retained the capacity to migrate, we performed parabiotic surgery on mice that had been on DR for 1 week prior to surgery and for the remainder of the experiment or control mice that were fed ad libitum throughout (Figure 2D). By 3 weeks post surgery, circulating memory T cell populations in the spleen and BM were in migratory equilibrium, while TRM cells in BM maintained their tissue-residency status (Figure 2E). This was the case both in parabiotic pairs fed ad libitum and those on DR, indicating that circulating memory T cells retained the ability to migrate in the context of DR and that the increase in number of T cells within the BM was associated with transient, rather than permanent, accumulation. We next assessed the motility of individual T cells in BM by intravital imaging. To this end, we transferred in vitro activated mTomato+ OT-I cells and performed two-photon imaging on skull BM. More T cells were observed within the BM of mice on DR compared to mice fed ad libitum (Figure 2F). The behavior of T cells was impacted by DR, evidenced by significantly reduced speed and track displacement length compared to T cells in BM of mice fed ad libitum (Figures 2F and 2G; Video S1). Collectively, these results support the idea that circulating memory T cells maintain their ability to migrate in the context of DR but display enhanced dwell time within the BM compartment. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI2MzFhODEzOGY3M2YxODJmNzdiOWE4YmY2M2UwMzk2MSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NjExNTM5fQ.UGvQlXKYn7xftbkJoj4s5FpDw_2gJzuvA0N63mZtJuppAiI6iPFW6VuBU9y-sFOrE5XuRKuLdcpKz36gpqI-uFjzXmQZfvmaOMOiyCMEmqU0Ie7cdmSq6oqcsZDLrN7x9y8lgOqd9ku5DV0DJxEjzEbnykogbyWI7uXDZpeVHftbHDDQr0KcTinZVM_nwKdFfKreKT3vzG6E4thfkExeQcb6CECQwJ1TcEK7NQvLFcCSssOD7VMqLGvYDCFqym-qlr4tUGFM5LhWaf4J6spU81NooR6DTas1hIaCkZEx83OsF7C44NVfT208-tofzx4jHytzqFAkg1e-TCzJ8CvblA Download .mp4 (2.67 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. T Cells Display Restricted Motility When in Bone Marrow of Mice on Dietary Restriction, Related to Figure 2 The accumulation of memory T cells in BM suggested that this niche provided a survival advantage in the context of DR. DR is associated with responses aimed at restoring energy balance, a process dominantly coordinated by glucocorticoids (GCs) (Cain and Cidlowski, 2017Cain D.W. Cidlowski J.A. Immune regulation by glucocorticoids.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). However, heightened levels of GC can promote T cell death (Fujita et al., 2002Fujita Y. Murakami M. Ogawa Y. Masuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ozaki S. Nakao K. Mimori T. Leptin inhibits stress-induced apoptosis of T lymphocytes.Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 128: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, Wing et al., 1988Wing E.J. Magee D.M. Barczynski L.K. Acute starvation in mice reduces the number of T cells and suppresses the development of T-cell-mediated immunity.Immunology. 1988; 63: 677-682PubMed Google Scholar). We found that while GCs were elevated in the blood of mice on DR compared to those fed ad libitum, the concentration of GC in BM was significantly lower both at baseline and during DR (Figure 3A). In agreement, the frequency of dead (DAPI+) memory T cells was increased in the spleen of mice early post DR but was lower in BM both at steady state and during DR (Figure 3B). Circulating memory T cells in the BM also expressed higher levels of the anti-apoptotic factor BCL-2 during DR (Figures 3C and S3A), suggesting that this compartment can promote memory T cell survival in the context of nutritional stress.Figure S3GC Drive Memory T Cells into BM during DR, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) BCL-2 expression by TEM in BM of mice fed ad libitum (blue) or on DR (red) for 3 wk.

To directly address a role for GC in orchestrating memory T cell redistribution during DR, we placed mice lacking adrenal glands (adrenalectomy or ADX) on DR (Fujita et al., 2002Fujita Y. Murakami M. Ogawa Y. Masuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ozaki S. Nakao K. Mimori T. Leptin inhibits stress-induced apoptosis of T lymphocytes.Clin. Exp.

Acute starvation in mice reduces the number of T cells and suppresses the development of T-cell-mediated immunity.Immunology. 1988; 63: 677-682PubMed Google Scholar). Under this setting, memory T cells did not collapse in SLO, nor did they accumulate in BM (Figures 3D and S3B). Furthermore, administration of the synthetic GC dexamethasone (Dex) reproduced the phenotype seen during DR, with a reduction of TCM in the spleen and an increase in BM (Figure 3E). While Dex treatment resulted in increased expression of BCL-2 by both subsets in BM (Figures 3F and S3C), its impact in terms of redistribution was more pronounced on TCM than TEM (Figures 3E and S3D), suggesting that these cells may have different levels of sensitivity to GCs. We next transferred CD8+ T cells from wild-type (WT) mice or those lacking the Nr3c1 gene that encodes the GC receptor (Mittelstadt et al., 2012Mittelstadt P.R. Monteiro J.P. Ashwell J.D. Thymocyte responsiveness to endogenous glucocorticoids is required for immunological fitness.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 2384-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) into mice fed ad libitum or on DR. Approximately half the number of WT cells could be recovered 1 week post transfer in the spleen of mice on DR when compared to the number of WT cells in the spleen of mice fed ad libitum (Figure 3G). In contrast, the number of Nr3c1−/− T cells was not reduced in the spleen of mice on DR compared to the number in the spleen of mice fed ad libitum (Figure 3G). On the other hand, WT and Nr3c1−/− T cells were both able to accumulate in the BM to a similar degree during DR (Figure 3G). Together, these results support the idea that a direct interaction between GCs and the GC receptor on T cells promoted their peripheral collapse during DR, while GCs induce T cell accumulation in the BM indirectly. Our results supported the idea that the BM milieu was impacted in a way that promoted the accumulation and survival of memory T cells during DR. Whole-tissue RNA sequencing revealed that the BM was profoundly remodeled during DR, with 3,981 genes significantly upregulated and 4,173 genes downregulated compared to mice fed ad libitum (Figure 4A). The most prominent changes involved the upregulation of genes associated with adipogenesis, whereas those involved in B cell development were downregulated (Figure 4A). Of note, cytokines involved in memory T cell homeostasis (IL-7 and IL-15) were not differentially expressed (Figure S4A).Figure S4BM Remodeling during DR Promotes Memory T Cell Recruitment and Retention, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Scatterplot showing the Il7 and Il15 genes in whole BM samples from mice fed ad libitum or on DR for 3 wk.

https://openalex.org/W2969302025,"Adaptive immunity provides life-long protection by generating central and effector memory T cells and the most recently described tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells. However, the cellular origin of CD4 TRM cells and their contribution to host defense remain elusive. Using IL-17A tracking-fate mouse models, we found that a significant fraction of lung CD4 TRM cells derive from IL-17A-producing effector (TH17) cells following immunization with heat-killed Klebsiella pneumonia (Kp). These exTH17 TRM cells are maintained in the lung by IL-7, produced by lymphatic endothelial cells. During a memory response, neither antibodies, γδ T cells, nor circulatory T cells are sufficient for the rapid host defense required to eliminate Kp. Conversely, using parabiosis and depletion studies, we demonstrated that exTH17 TRM cells play an important role in bacterial clearance. Thus, we delineate the origin and function of airway CD4 TRM cells during bacterial infection, offering novel strategies for targeted vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2969352988,"Nutritional status potentially influences immune responses; however, how nutritional signals regulate cellular dynamics and functionality remains obscure. Herein, we report that temporary fasting drastically reduces the number of lymphocytes by ∼50% in Peyer's patches (PPs), the inductive site of the gut immune response. Subsequent refeeding seemingly restored the number of lymphocytes, but whose cellular composition was conspicuously altered. A large portion of germinal center and IgA+ B cells were lost via apoptosis during fasting. Meanwhile, naive B cells migrated from PPs to the bone marrow during fasting and then back to PPs during refeeding when stromal cells sensed nutritional signals and upregulated CXCL13 expression to recruit naive B cells. Furthermore, temporal fasting before oral immunization with ovalbumin abolished the induction of antigen-specific IgA, failed to induce oral tolerance, and eventually exacerbated food antigen-induced diarrhea. Thus, nutritional signals are critical in maintaining gut immune homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2969908837,"Breast cancer is a common gynecological disease that poses a great threat to women health due to its high malignant rate. Breast cancer screening tests are used to find any warning signs or symptoms for early detection and currently, Ultrasound screening is the preferred method for breast cancer diagnosis. The localization and segmentation of the lesions in breast ultrasound (BUS) images are helpful for clinical diagnosis of the disease. In this paper, an RDAU-NET (Residual-Dilated-Attention-Gate-UNet) model is proposed and employed to segment the tumors in BUS images. The model is based on the conventional U-Net, but the plain neural units are replaced with residual units to enhance the edge information and overcome the network performance degradation problem associated with deep networks. To increase the receptive field and acquire more characteristic information, dilated convolutions were used to process the feature maps obtained from the encoder stages. The traditional cropping and copying between the encoder-decoder pipelines were replaced by the Attention Gate modules which enhanced the learning capabilities through suppression of background information. The model, when tested with BUS images with benign and malignant tumor presented excellent segmentation results as compared to other Deep Networks. A variety of quantitative indicators including Accuracy, Dice coefficient, AUC(Area-Under-Curve), Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, Recall, F1score and M-IOU (Mean-Intersection-Over-Union) provided performances above 80%. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed RDAU-NET model can accurately segment breast lesions when compared to other deep learning models and thus has a good prospect for clinical diagnosis."

In cancer, CCR7-mediated trafficking leads to lymph node metastasis, suggesting the receptor as a promising therapeutic target. Here, we present the crystal structure of human CCR7 fused to the protein Sialidase NanA by using data up to 2.1 Å resolution. The structure shows the ligand Cmp2105 bound to an intracellular allosteric binding pocket. A sulfonamide group, characteristic for various chemokine receptor ligands, binds to a patch of conserved residues in the Gi protein binding region between transmembrane helix 7 and helix 8. We demonstrate how structural data can be used in combination with a compound repository and automated thermal stability screening to identify and modulate allosteric chemokine receptor antagonists. We detect both novel (CS-1 and CS-2) and clinically relevant (CXCR1-CXCR2 phase-II antagonist Navarixin) CCR7 modulators with implications for multi-target strategies against cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2969862048,"A hallmark feature of inflammation is the orchestrated recruitment of neutrophils from the bloodstream into inflamed tissue. Although selectins and integrins mediate recruitment in many tissues, they have a minimal role in the lungs and liver. Exploiting an unbiased in vivo functional screen, we identified a lung and liver homing peptide that functionally abrogates neutrophil recruitment to these organs. Using biochemical, genetic, and confocal intravital imaging approaches, we identified dipeptidase-1 (DPEP1) as the target and established its role as a physical adhesion receptor for neutrophil sequestration independent of its enzymatic activity. Importantly, genetic ablation or functional peptide blocking of DPEP1 significantly reduced neutrophil recruitment to the lungs and liver and provided improved survival in models of endotoxemia. Our data establish DPEP1 as a major adhesion receptor on the lung and liver endothelium and identify a therapeutic target for neutrophil-driven inflammatory diseases of the lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2969690901,"The Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged surveillance and control. As the epidemic appears to be waning, it is unclear whether transmission is still ongoing, which is exacerbated by discrepancies in reporting. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases to identify transmission not captured by reporting. We uncovered an unreported outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring islands. By sequencing Zika virus, we show that the establishment of the virus was delayed by a year and that the ensuing outbreak was sparked by long-lived lineages of Zika virus from other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that, although mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, such measures need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be “silently” spreading and provides a framework for understanding outbreak dynamics.Video Abstracthttps://www.cell.com/cms/asset/cf1f6eb3-5b47-4bfa-866e-04042a261c30/mmc5.mp4Loading ...(mp4, 55.46 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2969462190,"Expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in ATXN1 causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a neurodegenerative disease that impairs coordination and cognition. While ATXN1 is associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, CAG repeat number in AD patients is not changed. Here, we investigated the consequences of ataxin-1 loss of function and discovered that knockout of Atxn1 reduced CIC-ETV4/5-mediated inhibition of Bace1 transcription, leading to increased BACE1 levels and enhanced amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, selectively in AD-vulnerable brain regions. Elevated BACE1 expression exacerbated Aβ deposition and gliosis in AD mouse models and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and olfactory axonal targeting. In SCA1 mice, polyglutamine-expanded mutant ataxin-1 led to the increase of BACE1 post-transcriptionally, both in cerebrum and cerebellum, and caused axonal-targeting deficit and neurodegeneration in the hippocampal CA2 region. These findings suggest that loss of ataxin-1 elevates BACE1 expression and Aβ pathology, rendering it a potential contributor to AD risk and pathogenesis."

In particular, it was aimed to design the gradient-structure in the titanium with enhanced properties by applying 4 ECAP passes to form bulk structure of ultrafine-grains and subsequently subjecting SMAT to the surface of ECAPed samples to produce nanostructured surface region. Microstructural examination was made by electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD). Also, microhardness, nanoindentation, topography, roughness and wettability were evaluated. To examine the biological response, human osteosarcoma cells were cultured in contact with the samples in various time periods and morphology change, cell viability and alkaline phosphate activity were conducted also cell morphology was monitored. EBSD showed development of ultrafine-grained structure after 4 passes of ECAP with an average grain size of 500 nm. Applying SMAT resulted in additional refinement in the ECAP samples, particularly in the subsurface regions to a depth of 112 μm. Furthermore, the SMATed samples showed an enhancement in roughness, wettability and hardness magnitudes. Viability enhanced up to 7% in SMATed + ECAPed sample, although the acceptable cell adhesion, improved cell differentiation and mineralization were seen. The combined use of ECAP and SMAT has shown a good potential for optimizing the design of modern functionally graded medical devices and implants."
https://openalex.org/W2969497040,"Background and objectives In the present article, we explore a novel strategy of selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by investigating the effect of Se-NPs alone and in combination with standard anti-diabetic drug metformin (MET) in high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)-induced T2DM. Methods HFD was supplemented daily to experimental rats for 8 weeks, followed by a single low dose injection of 35 mg/kg of STZ to induce T2DM. The synergistic effect of the different therapeutic strategies on diabetic complications was evaluated after the Se-NPs and MET administration for 8 weeks. Molecular and biochemical analyses were conducted to figure out the effectiveness of our treatment on insulin sensitivity, oxidative mediators and inflammatory markers. Results Our observations demonstrated that HFD/STZ-induced rats have a toxic effect on serum and hepatic tissues resulted in inducing remarkable oxidative damage and hyper-inflammation with a significant disturbance in the insulin signaling pathway. Experimental animals either treated with mono-therapeutic-two doses Se-NPs (0.1 and 0.4 mg/kg) and/or MET (100 mg/kg) alone as well as the combined therapy resulted in a remarkable protective anti-diabetic effect illustrated by significant decreases in fasting blood glucose and insulin levels after 8 weeks treatment. At the same time, the levels of active insulin signaling proteins pIRS1/pAKT/pGSK-3β/pAMPK were significantly improved. Moreover, Se-NPs exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect by the mitigation of cytokine expression and a balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant status was restored. Furthermore, the anti-diabetic drug MET administration also exhibited a significant improvement in diabetic complications after the treatment period. Conclusion This study provides mightily the mechanism of action of combined Se-NPs and MET as a promising therapeutic alternative that synergistically alleviates most of diabetic complications and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2969468250,"Ticks are second only to mosquitoes as vectors of disease to humans and animals. Tick host detection is mainly ascribed to Haller’s organ, a complex sensory structure on the tick foreleg that detects odors, carbon dioxide and heat, but these host detection mechanisms are not well understood. There is anecdotal evidence that ticks and other ectoparasites are attracted to heat, but it has never been demonstrated that they use radiant heat to detect hosts at a distance. In fact, previous attempts to do this have concluded that radiant heat was not used by ticks. Here we use a novel thermotaxis assay to investigate the detection range, temperature dependence and repellent sensitivity of heat perception in ticks and to identify the sensory organ responsible for this sense. We show that Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis ticks can locate a human from several meters away by radiant heat sensed by the part of Haller’s organ known as the capsule, a covered spherical pit organ. An aperture in the capsule cover confers directionality and highly reflective interior surfaces of the capsule concentrate radiation on the sensilla to sharpen directionality and increase sensitivity. Commercial insect repellents provide an effective means of personal protection against potentially infectious tick bites by hindering host-seeking behavior. Low concentrations of the insect repellents DEET, picaridin, 2-undecanone, citronellal and nootkatone eliminate thermotaxis without affecting olfaction-stimulated host-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that the tick Haller’s organ capsule is a radiant heat sensor used in host-finding and that repellents disrupt this sense at concentrations that do not disrupt olfaction. We anticipate that this discovery will significantly aid insect repellent research and provide novel targets for the development of innovative integrated pest management programs and personal protection strategies for ectoparasites and vector-borne disease."
https://openalex.org/W2969661570,"Several reports indicate crosstalk between the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and estrogen, which has a protective effect in colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Nrf2 signaling in the anti-inflammatory effect of estrogen using Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), a powerful system to test the function of target genes due to their easy accessibility, and rapid growth rates. After inducing inflammation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), the effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) on the expression of proinflammatory mediators [i.e., NF-κB and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)] and estrogen receptors were evaluated by Western blot. In wild type (WT) MEFs, E2 treatment ameliorated TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB and expression of its target protein iNOS. Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) expression was decreased by TNF-α-induced inflammation and restored by E2 treatment. When treated to WT MEFs, E2 induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2. The inhibitory effect of E2 on TNF-α-induced enhancement of iNOS was markedly dampened in Nrf2 KO MEFs. Notably, ERβ expression was significantly diminished in Nrf2 KO MEFs compared to that in WT cells. Promoter Database (EPD) revealed two putative anti-oxidant response elements (AREs) within the mouse ERβ promoter. Furthermore, in WT MEFs, E2 treatment repressed TNF-α-induced expression of iNOS protein and recovered by 4-(2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo(1,5-a)pyrimidin-3-yl)phenol (PHTPP), a selective ERβ antagonist, treatment, but not in Nrf2 KO MEFs. In conclusion, Nrf2 plays a pivotal role in the anti-inflammatory of estrogen by direct regulating the expression of ERβ."

In this study, based on 201,187 SNP markers developed from the SLAF-seq (specific locus amplified fragment sequencing), a genome wide association study of four important fatty acid content traits (erucic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid) in a panel of 300 inbred lines of rapeseed in two environments (JXAU and JXRIS) was carried out. A total of 148 SNP loci significantly associated with these traits were detected by MLM model analysis respectively, and 30 SNP loci on A08 and C03 chromosomes were detected in three traits of erucic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid contents simultaneously. Furthermore, 108 highly favorable alleles for increasing oleic acid and linoleic acid content, also for decreasing erucic acid content simultaneously were observed. By a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) search with in a distance of 100 Kb around these significantly SNP-trait associations, we identified 20 orthologs of the functional candidate genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis, including the known vital fatty acid biosynthesis genes of BnaA.FAE1 and BnaC. FAE1 on the A08 and C03 chromosomes, and other potential candidate genes involving in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, such as the orthologs genes of FAD2, LACS09, KCS17, CER4, TT16 and ACBP5.

Conventional in vitro maturation (IVM) impairs oocyte competence by inducing spontaneous meiotic resumption. A series of experiments were performed to determine if maintaining meiotic arrest during a pre-maturation culture phase (pre-IVM) prior to conventional IVM improves oocyte competence of juvenile-goat (2 months old) cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). In experiment 1, COCs were cultured with C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP; 0, 50, 100, 200 nM) for 6 and 8 h. Nuclear stage was assessed, revealing no differences in the incidence of germinal vesicle (GV) breakdown. In experiment 2, the same CNP concentrations were assessed plus 10 nM estradiol, the known upstream agonist activating expression of NPR2, the exclusive receptor of CNP. CNP (200 nM) plus estradiol increased the rate of oocytes at GV stage at 6 h compared to control group (74.7% vs 28.3%; P<0.05) with predominantly condensed chromatin configuration. In experiment 3, relative mRNA quantification revealed NPR2 expression was down-regulated after pre-IVM (6 h). In experiment 4, analysis of transzonal projections indicated that pre-IVM maintained cumulus-oocyte communication after oocyte recovery. For experiments 5 and 6, biphasic IVM (6 h pre-IVM with CNP and estradiol, plus 24 h IVM) and control IVM (24 h) were compared. Biphasic IVM increased intra-oocyte glutathione and decreased ROS, up-regulated DNA-methyltransferase 1 and pentraxin 3 expression and led to an increase in rate of blastocyst development compared to control group (30.2% vs 17.2%; P<0.05). In conclusion, a biphasic IVM, including a pre-IVM with CNP, maintains oocyte meiotic arrest for 6 h and enhances the embryo developmental competence of oocytes from juvenile goats."
https://openalex.org/W2969959314,"Coastal marine ecosystems provide livelihoods for small-scale fishers and coastal communities around the world. Small-scale fisheries face great challenges since they are difficult to monitor, enforce, and manage, which may lead to overexploitation. Combining territorial use rights for fisheries (TURF) with no-take marine reserves to create TURF-reserves can improve the performance of small-scale fisheries by buffering fisheries from environmental variability and management errors, while ensuring that fishers reap the benefits of conservation investments. Since 2012, 18 old and new community-based Mexican TURF-reserves gained legal recognition thanks to a regulation passed in 2012; their effectiveness has not been formally evaluated. We combine causal inference techniques and the Social-Ecological Systems framework to provide a holistic evaluation of community-based TURF-reserves in three coastal communities in Mexico. We find that, overall, reserves have not yet achieved their stated goals of increasing the density of lobster and other benthic invertebrates, nor increasing lobster catches. A lack of clear ecological and socioeconomic effects likely results from a combination of factors. First, some of these reserves might be too young for the effects to show (reserves were 6–10 years old). Second, the reserves are not large enough to protect mobile species, like lobster. Third, variable and extreme oceanographic conditions have impacted harvested populations. Fourth, local fisheries are already well managed, and while reserves may protect populations within its boundaries, it is unlikely that reserves might have a detectable effect in catches. However, even small reserves are expected to provide benefits for sedentary invertebrates over longer time frames, with continued protection. These reserves may provide a foundation for establishing additional, larger marine reserves needed to effectively conserve mobile species."
https://openalex.org/W2969244780,"Sexual selection promotes the evolution of conspicuous animal ornaments. To evolve as signals, these traits must reliably express the ""quality"" of the bearer, an indicator of individual fitness. Direct estimates of individual fitness may include the contribution of longevity and fecundity. However, evidence of a correlation between the level of signal expression and these two fitness components are scarce, at least among vertebrates. Relative fitness is difficult to assess in the wild as age at death and extra-pair paternity rates are often unknown. Here, in captive male red-legged partridges, we show that carotenoid-based ornament expression, i.e., redness of the bill and eye rings, at the beginning of reproductive life predicts both longevity (1-7 years) and lifetime breeding output (offspring number and hatching success). The recently proposed link between the individual capacity to produce red (keto) carotenoid pigments and the efficiency of cell respiration could, ultimately, explain the correlation with lifespan and, indirectly, fecundity. Nonetheless, in males of avian species, carotenoid-based coloration in bare parts is also partially controlled by testosterone. We also manipulated androgen levels throughout life by treating males with testosterone or antiandrogen compounds. Treatments caused correlations between signal levels and both fitness components to disappear, thus making the signals unreliable. This suggests that the evolution of carotenoid-based sexual signals requires a tightly-controlled steroid metabolism."

Preliminary testing showed that the herbal lollipop reduced salivary S. mutans counts in vivo. In this study, we aimed to further test the efficacy of this herbal lollipop for reducing salivary S. mutans levels, and investigate its impact on salivary microbiome. Using a well-established in vitro oral microbiome model, we showed that licorice extract displays targeted killing against S. mutans without affecting the biodiversity of the community. In vivo study corroborated in vitro findings, showing for high caries-risk children aged 3-6 with salivary S. mutans levels >5x105 cells/ml, daily use of 2 licorice-containing lollipops for 3 weeks significantly reduced salivary S. mutans levels compared to the control group. Salivary microbiome analysis showed either no change or even increase in phylogenetic diversity of the oral community following herbal lollipop usage. Although further study with longer term observation is needed, these results suggest that use of licorice extract-containing lollipops can be as a simple and effective way to reduce the risk of dental caries in children."
https://openalex.org/W2969683474,"Background Although the perinatal mortality rate (PNMR) has been reduced over time in Bangladesh, the rate is still very high. Only a few studies explored the determinants of high PNMR in Bangladesh, yet most of them were small-scale or conducted for stillbirths and early neonatal deaths separately. The objective of this study was to explore the trends in and determinants of perinatal deaths in Bangladesh which would be an advanced step in effective policies to tackle the issue. Methods The data used for this study was extracted from four rounds of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (BDHSs) 2004, 2007, 2011 and 2014. We considered the outcome of the 26604 pregnancies reaching seven months of their gestation. The trends of perinatal mortality was assessed using the Cochran–Armitage test, while the logistic regression with generalized estimating equation (GEE) to account for the clustering effect was implemented to explore the association between perinatal mortality and its risk factors. Results The PNMR was significantly reduced from 64 (95% CI: 57–73) to 41 (95% CI: 35–48) per 1000 pregnancies between 2004 and 2014 (stillbirths: 34 to 19 and early neonatal deaths: 30 to 22). After adjusting for potential covariates in the model, we found that administrative division, type of cooking fuel, child’s gender, maternal occupation, body mass index, birth interval, history of miscarriage, previous deaths of children, total number of under 5 children, mode of delivery, type of delivery, access to participation in decision making, paternal education and occupation were significantly associated with perinatal deaths. Conclusion The study highlights the importance of strengthening proper postnatal care services in the healthcare facilities. Alongside this, effort should also be stressed to ensure proper pregnancy care and to improve the socio-economic condition of the households to address the issue."

The aim of this study was to develop a greater understanding of the characteristics of PTD and TRD in nearly the entire adult population in South Korea using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA). Method Diagnostic codes and prescription data for South Korean adults were extracted from the HIRA. Subjects were included in the PTD cohort if they received at least one prescription for antidepressants and were diagnosed with depression. TRD was defined as PTD having two or more regimen failures of antidepressants or antipsychotics. Results In 2012, there were 41,256,396 adults in South Korea with 834,694 meeting the criteria for PTD (2.0%). Among subjects with PTD, 57% stopped treatment in less than 28 days of antidepressant supply. Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants were the most frequently used antidepressants as a first-line regimen for PTD (44.3% of PTD) followed by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (32.1% of PTD). Results also indicated that 34,812 subjects developed TRD (4.2% of PTD). Median PTD and TRD durations were 28 and 623 days respectively. Proportions of psychiatric and non-psychiatric comorbidities were higher in TRD cases than in PTD cases that were not treatment resistant. Conclusions Despite a small proportion of patients with TRD, the prolonged duration of illness and higher comorbidity implies the need for better treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2969437881,"The present study aimed to better characterize the morphogenesis of the femur from the embryonic to the early fetal periods. Sixty-two human fetal specimens (crown-rump length [CRL] range: 11.4-185 mm) from the Kyoto Collection were used for this study. The morphogenesis and internal differentiation process of the femur were analyzed in 3D using phase-contrast X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The cartilaginous femur was first observed at Carnegie stage 18. Major anatomical landmarks were formed prior to the initiation of ossification at the center of the diaphysis (CRL, 40 mm), as described by Bardeen. The region with very high signal intensity (phase 5 according to Streeter's classification; i.e., area described as cartilage disintegration) emerged at the center of the diaphysis, which split the region with slightly low signal intensity (phase 4; i.e., cartilage cells of maximum size) in fetuses with a CRL of 40.0 mm. The phase 4 and phase 5 regions became confined to the metaphysis, which might become the epiphyseal cartilage plate. Femur length and ossified shaft length (OSL) showed a strong positive correlation with CRL. The OSL-to-femur length ratio rapidly increased in fetuses with CRL between 40 and 75 mm, which became moderately increased in fetuses with a CRL of ≥75 mm. Cartilage canal invasion occurred earlier at the proximal epiphysis (CRL, 62 mm) than at the distal epiphysis (CRL, 75 mm). Morphometry and Procrustes analysis indicated that changes in the femur shape after ossification were limited, which were mainly detected at the time of initial ossification and shortly after that. In contrast, femoral neck anteversion and torsion of the femoral head continuously changed during the fetal period. Our data could aid in understanding the morphogenesis of the femur and in differentiating normal and abnormal development during the early fetal period."
https://openalex.org/W2969601510,"Introduction There are gaps in global understanding about how to design and implement interventions to improve sanitation. This formative study provided insights for the subsequent redesign of a government-led national sanitation campaign targeting rural populations in Tanzania. Methods The Behaviour Centred Design approach was used to investigate the determinants of toilet building, improvement and use. Varied, novel, and interactive research tools were employed in fifty-five households in two regions of rural Tanzania. Results were analysed to articulate a Theory of Change, which then informed intervention design. Results Participants valued hard work, enterprise, and improving their lives over many years. They wanted better toilets but felt no urgency to act quickly. A common emotional motivator for improving toilets was to protect children from disease (Nurture) but this was insufficient to drive rapid change. Disgust with traditional toilets meant they were built at a distance from the house: an ‘out of sight, out of mind’ attitude. Other powerful motives included the desire to improve living conditions (Create), and to become a modern Tanzanian (Status), albeit without ‘showing off’. Construction costs and water scarcity were the main stated barriers. Receiving information about realistic costs, support accessing materials, and visiting better latrines elsewhere were commonly reported reasons for improving latrines. Conclusions The resulting Theory of Change recommended that the intervention should surprise people with a novel conversation about toilets, promote toilets as a means of conferring status, and introduce a perceived urgency to ‘act now’. It should suggest that modest improvements would lead to a better life. Feelings of disgust and fear with poor quality toilets should be amplified, and barriers lessened through promoting transformational toilet improvements, and improving access to modern toilet products. This research provided considerable insight into sanitation behaviours in rural Tanzania, which informed creative intervention design."
https://openalex.org/W2969633624,"Many studies purport that in low-income countries, women are often responsible for producing, preparing and purchasing food. Consequently, policies related to food and nutrition overemphasise the role of women, underestimating the potential for cooperation and complementarity between men and women. This focus on women does not account for socially constructed expectations of women that undermine their decision-making in resource allocation. Using desk reviews, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, our case study in Malawi sought to understand the complementary role of men in maternal and child nutrition. International agreements and Malawi's policies were reviewed to understand how men's involvement emerged on the nutrition policy agenda. Policymakers, stakeholders and men and women from rural Central Malawi were interviewed, sharing their experiences of men's role in maternal and child health. The study found that men's involvement in maternal and child health has been on the development agenda since as early as 1995. Malawi has made efforts to involve men in these areas through several policy actions and programmes. Contrary to literature suggesting that women are the main producers, procurers and preparers of food, this study found that men in rural Central Malawi are increasingly becoming responsible for providing and purchasing food. Men also play a supportive role in food preparation, helping women access diverse diets during and after pregnancy. They also take up a supportive role in household activities, providing women with assistance in housework and looking after children. The positive change in men's roles presents an opportunity for exploring how men can contribute to food security and nutrition. Opportunities exist for designing inclusive food and agriculture policies that promote cooperation between men and women in food and nutrition. These policies can challenge misinterpretations of women's role in food security and the underlying systems that reinforce gender inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W2969401903,"In the first weeks after liver transplantation about 30% of the patients develop a posttransplant encephalopathy. A posttransplant encephalopathy comprises metabolic-toxic caused symptoms such as disorientation, confusion, hallucinations, cognitive dysfunction and seizures. We hypothesize that alterations of cerebral metabolites before liver transplantation predispose posttransplant encephalopathy development after liver transplantation.31 patients with chronic liver disease underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) before liver transplantation to assess glutamine/glutamate (Glx), myo-Inositol (mI), choline (Cho), creatine/phosphocreatine- and N-acetyl-aspartate/N-acetyl-aspartate-glutamate concentrations in the thalamus, lentiform nucleus and white matter. Of these, 14 patients underwent MRS additionally after liver transplantation. Furthermore, 15 patients received MRS only after liver transplantation. Patients' data were compared to 20 healthy age adjusted controls.Patients showed significantly increased Glx and decreased mI and Cho concentrations compared to controls before liver transplantation (p≤0.01). The MRS values before liver transplantation of patients with posttransplant encephalopathy showed no significant difference compared to patients without posttransplant encephalopathy. Patients after liver transplantation showed increased Glx concentrations (p≤0.01) compared to controls, however, patients with and without posttransplant encephalopathy did not differ. Patients with posttransplant encephalopathy who underwent MRS before and after liver transplantation showed a significant mI increase in all three brain regions (p<0.04) and Glx decrease in the lentiform nucleus after liver transplantation (p = 0.04) while patients without posttransplant encephalopathy only showed a mI increase in the thalamus (p = 0.04).Patients with and without posttransplant encephalopathy showed no significant difference in cerebral metabolites before liver transplantation. However, the paired sub-analysis indicates that the extent of cerebral metabolite alterations in patients with liver cirrhosis might be critical for the development of posttransplant encephalopathy after liver transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2969673409,"Reconstruction has progressed steadily since the 2011 TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station accident. However, some people still hesitate to eat foods from Fukushima or to travel there, and there are concerns about the health risks of radiation. We investigated the relationships among reconstruction-related behavior, risk perception, types of information, and information sources, in order to consider appropriate measures for providing information and promoting reconstruction-related behavior a number of years after the accident. We conducted an online questionnaire survey (n = 1000) of Tokyo residents. First, a factor analysis was conducted on knowledge associated with radiation. Two factors were extracted; namely, “physical knowledge” and “health/social knowledge.” We conducted structural equation modeling to construct a model of “knowledge,” “radiation risk perception,” and “intention concerning reconstruction-related behavior.” “Intention concerning reconstruction-related behavior” decreased with “radiation risk perception” and increased with “health/social knowledge.” In addition, “health/social knowledge” negatively affected “radiation risk perception;” this effect was not large, but it was significant. Second, respondents were clarified by information sources using a cluster analysis. Clusters that included respondents who got information from public relations materials issued by municipalities and websites of administrative agencies had a higher factor score for “health/social knowledge” than other clusters. The cluster of respondents who did not get any particular knowledge had the lowest factor score, which was significant, and also had a low “perception of reconstruction.”"
https://openalex.org/W2969576114,"Introduction School victimization by peers is an important social problem with serious short- and long-term consequences poorly studied at preschool ages, which can lead to school bullying without timely intervention. Longitudinal data was used to determine the prevalence of warning signs of preschool peer victimization and its individual and family risk factors. Methods Data was obtained from 577 community preschoolers. School victimization was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) administered to parents and teachers of children at ages 4 and 5. Risk factors for the child (demographics, conduct and emotional problems, aggressiveness) and the family (maternal problems during pregnancy and early development, parenting styles, adaptive functioning and parents’ problems) were previously recorded at 3 years old. Results Combined information from parents and teachers showed that 4.2% of preschoolers presented warning signs of victimization at ages 4 and 5. Low socioeconomic status, poor emotional control, early problems making friends and low level of parenting education in social norms at age 3 predicted later victimization at ages 4 and 5 (AUC = .78). Conclusion Peer victimization affects a considerable percentage of preschoolers. Early detection may help to reduce the risk of escalation."
https://openalex.org/W2969379822,"Cataracts have long been known, but a biomathematical model is still unavailable for cataratogenesis. There has been a renewed interest in ionizing radiation cataracts because the recent international recommendation of the reduced lens dose limit stimulated the discussion toward its regulatory implementation in various countries. Nevertheless, a relationship between radiation (dose and dose rate) and response (e.g., incidence, onset and progression) remains incompletely understood, raising the need for a risk-predictive mathematical model. We here report for the first time an in silico model for cataractogenesis. First, a simplified cell proliferation model was developed for human lens growth based on stem and progenitor cell proliferation as well as epithelial-fiber cell differentiation. Then, a model for spontaneous cataractogenesis was developed to reproduce the human data on a relationship between age and cataract incidence. Finally, a model for radiation cataractogenesis was developed that can reproduce the human data on a relationship between dose and cataract onset at various ages, which was further applied to estimate cataract incidence following chronic lifetime exposure. The model can serve as the foundation for further development of the risk-predictive model for cataractogenesis along with additional considerations of various biological mechanisms and epidemiological datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2969429364,"Lung cancer frequently co-exists with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), which can be subdivided into idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and IIP other than IPF (other IIP). Although chemotherapy in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients with IIP may result in the exacerbation of IIP, these patients commonly receive chemotherapy. This study aimed to assess the risks and benefits of chemotherapy in SCLC patients with IIP.We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 122 patients with SCLC who received chemotherapy. Patients with secondary interstitial lung disease (ILD) of known etiology were excluded. Eligible patients were divided into two groups: SCLC with and without IIP. The former group was subdivided into those with IPF and other IIP.Of the 47 (39.2%) SCLC patients with IIP, 20 had IPF and 27 had other IIP. The frequency of chemotherapy-induced ILD development or IIP exacerbation was higher in patients with IPF (40.0%) than in those with other IIP (3.7%) and non-IIP (1.4%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that ILD development or IIP exacerbation was independently associated with IPF (P = 0.007). Time to treatment failure (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P = 0.001) were different among the groups., Cox proportional hazard model revealed that IPF was independently associated with time to treatment failure (P = 0,017) and overall survival (P = 0.006). Other IIP had no impact on time to treatment failure or overall survival. Development of ILD or exacerbation of IIP independently reduced time to treatment failure and overall survival.Comorbid IPF can be an independent, negative prognostic indicator and at high risk of ILD development or IIP exacerbation in SCLC patients. Early diagnosis and intervention for chemotherapy-induced IIP exacerbation will be beneficial for SCLC patients with IPF, who need close monitoring for its onset."
https://openalex.org/W2969902871,"Chronic wound infections are increasingly recognized to be dynamic and polymicrobial in nature, necessitating the development of wound models which reflect the complexities of infection in a non-healing wound. Wound slough isolated from human chronic wounds and transferred to mice was recently shown to create polymicrobial infection in mice, and there is potential this tool may be improved by cryogenic preservation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the application of cryogenic preservation to transferring polymicrobial communities, specifically by quantifying the effects of cryopreservation and wound microbiome transplantation. Slough from an established murine polymicrobial surgical excision model and five patients were subjected to three preservation strategies: refrigeration until infection, freezing in liquid nitrogen, or freezing in liquid nitrogen with glycerol solution prior to infection in individual mice. Four days following inoculation onto mice, wound microbiota were quantified using either culture isolation or by 16s rRNA gene community profiling and quantitative PCR. Cryogenic preservation did not significantly reduce bacterial viability. Reestablished microbial communities were significantly associated with patient of origin as well as host context (i.e., originally preserved from a patient versus mouse infection). Whereas preservation treatment did not significantly shape community composition, the transfers of microbiomes from human to mouse were characterized by reduced diversity and compositional changes. These findings indicated that changes should be expected to occur to community structure after colonization, and that compositional change is likely due to the rapid change in infection context as opposed to preservation strategy. Furthermore, species that were present in higher relative abundance in wound inoculate were more likely to colonize subsequent wounds, and wound inoculate with higher bacterial load established wound communities that were more compositionally similar. Results inform expectations for the complementation of chronic wound in vivo modeling with cryogenic preservation archives."
https://openalex.org/W2969911057,"Hippocrepis hippocrepis is a notocotylid that has been widely reported in capybaras; however, the molluscs that act as intermediate hosts of this parasite remain unknown. Furthermore, there are currently no molecular data available for H. hippocrepis regarding its phylogenetic relationship with other members of the family Notocotylidae. In the present study, we collected monostome cercariae and adult parasites from the planorbid Biomphalaria straminea and in the large intestine of capybaras, respectively, from Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We subjected them to morphological and molecular (amplification and sequencing of partial regions of 28S and cox-1 genes) studies. Adult parasites collected from the capybaras were identified as H. hippocrepis and the sequences obtained for both molecular markers showed 100% similarity with monostome cercariae found in B. straminea. The sequences obtained for H. hippocrepis were compared with data available in public databases; analysis revealed this species differs from other notocotylids with available sequences (1.5-3.8% with respect to 28S and 11.4%-13.8% with respect to cox-1). On the phylogenetic analyses, H. hippocrepis appeared to be a distinct lineage in relation to other notocotylids. Some ecological aspects related to the infection of capybaras with H. hippocrepis are briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2969627173,"Starting from 1972, colchicine is known as the most useful drug for prevention of familial Mediterranean fever attacks. However, some patients do not respond to colchicine treatment, even taken in high doses. Despite the fact, that different hypotheses have been proposed, the molecular mechanisms of colchicine resistance are not completely clear. It is generally known, that colchicine binds β-tubulin and inhibits microtubules polymerization. The β-tubulin gene has SNPs, which lead to amino acid substitutions, and some of them are located in colchicine binding site (CBS). We have assumed, that this SNPs can affect tubulin-colchicine interaction and might be the reason for colchicine resistance. With this in mind, we modeled 7 amino acid substitutions in CBS, performed molecular dynamics simulations of tubulin-colchicine complex and calculated binding energies for every amino acid substitution. Thus, our study shows, that two amino acid substitutions in the β-tubulin, namely A248T and M257V, reduce binding energy for approximately 2-fold. Based on this, we assume, that these amino acid substitutions could be the reason for colchicine resistance. Thus, our study gives a new insight into colchicine resistance mechanism and provides information for designing colchicine alternatives, that could be effective for colchicine resistant patients."
https://openalex.org/W2969896008,"Ganoderma sinense is a Chinese unique medicinal fungus that has been used in folk medicine for thousands of years. Polysaccharides are considered to be biologically active ingredients due to their immune-modulating functions. Previously we found that GSP-2, a new polysaccharide isolated from Ganoderma sinense, exerts an immunomodulatory effect in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells but the underlying mechanism is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate how GSP-2 triggers immunologic responses and the implicated signaling pathways. GSP-2 effects were investigated both in a macrophagic cell line, RAW264.7, and in primary macrophages. Moreover, the molecular basis of GSP-2 recognition by immune cells, and the consequent activation of signaling cascades, were explored by employing recombinant human HEK293-TLR-Blue clones, individually overexpressing various Toll-like receptors. GSP-2 dose-dependently induced the overexpression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) but did not affect the expression of other TLRs. Moreover, GSP-2 induced TNFα secretion in primary macrophages from wild-type, but not TLR4-knockout mice. In addition, GSP-2 upregulated TLR4 protein expression and activated the MAPK pathway in RAW246.7 macrophages. Finally, GSP-2 induced the production of the cytokines TNFα, IL1β, and IL6. Our data demonstrated that GSP-2 was specifically recognized by TLR4, promoting cytokine secretion and immune modulation in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2969435560,"This study aimed to identify how playing basketball with two additional baskets influences the players’ technical, physiological, physical and especially, positional performance. Fourteen youth players performed eight 5vs.5 simulated basketball games, four with the two official baskets and four with two-extra official baskets, each one placed in the court restricted area. The variables collected were technical (field-goals made and missed, offensive and defensive rebounds, steals, passes, dribble-drive, give-and-go and ball possessions), physiological (heart rate monotony and sample entropy), workload (total distance covered and distance covered at different velocities) and positioning-related (distance to the nearest opponent, distance to the nearest teammate, stretch-index and distance between centroids). The results showed that the four-baskets games favoured the emergence of individual behaviours, increasing the game' physical demands and promoting a collective dispersion, which might impair team playing. Conversely, when playing with two-baskets, there was less distance between teammates. In conclusion, this study has clear implications for practice as it emphasizes that coaches can manipulate the number of baskets to modulate training workload and promote different individual and team behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2969761923,"Metal implants not only deteriorate image quality, but also increase radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of metal hip prosthesis on absorbed radiation dose and assess the efficacy of organ dose modulation (ODM) and metal artifact reduction (MAR) protocols on dose reduction. An anthropomorphic phantom was scanned with and without bilateral metal hip prostheses, and surface and deep level radiation doses were measured at the abdomen and pelvis. Finally, the absorbed radiation doses at pelvic and abdominal cavities in the reference, ODM, and two MAR scans (Gemstone spectral imaging, GE) were compared. The Mann Whitney-U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed to compare the volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and mean absorbed radiation doses. Unilateral and bilateral metal hip prostheses increased CTDIVOL by 14.4% and 30.5%, respectively. MAR protocols decreased absorbed radiation doses in the pelvis. MAR showed the most significant dose reduction in the deep pelvic cavity followed by ODM. However, MAR protocols increased absorbed radiation doses in the upper abdomen. ODM significantly reduced absorbed radiation in the pelvis and abdomen. In conclusion, metal hip implants increased radiation doses in abdominopelvic CT scans. MAR and ODM techniques reduced absorbed radiation dose in abdominopelvic CT scans with metal hip prostheses."
https://openalex.org/W2969458933,"Despite the increased risks of cancers and cardiovascular related diseases, tobacco smoking continues to be prevalent in the population due largely in part to the addictive nature of nicotine. Nicotine vaccines are an attractive alternative to the current smoking cessation options but have yet to be successful enough in clinical trials to reach the market due to a lack of neutralizing antibodies and inconsistent results. Using AFPL1 derived from the Cuban meningococcal vaccine as an adjuvant, we have previously published promising results with an intranasally administered nicotine vaccine. In order to examine the immunogenicity and safety of this vaccine in mice we set up a pilot trial administering the vaccine either intranasally, intramuscularly or utilizing both routes simultaneously and evaluated immune responses and clinical symptoms throughout the duration of the vaccination protocol and post-mortem. These data further demonstrate the ability of the AFPL1 nicotine conjugate vaccine to be a safe and potential candidate for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2969631645,"China relaxed its family planning policy and adopted a universal two-child policy on January 1, 2016 to actively address the country's aging trend. However, the policy has failed to have any significant effect on the fertility rate of many provinces. In light of the country having the highest sex ratio at birth in the world and the huge burden of the aging population, improving the fertility rate is an urgent priority in China. This facility-based cross-sectional survey aimed to study determinants of fertility decision-making among couples based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. The study was conducted in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. A structured self-administered questionnaire was completed by 1,399 couples, consisting of wives aged 20-49 years and their husbands. Based on the structural equation modeling method of analysis, determinants of fertility decision-making were perceived behavior control (perceived importance of having a stable income and cost of raising a child), subjective norms (perceived social pressure about ""sex preference of the newborn by themselves and their partner"") and attitudes (only healthy parents can have a child). Other significant factors influencing fertility decision were ethnicity and education level, with ethnic minority couples having less perception of social norm towards fertility and those with higher education having higher perceived control toward having a (further) child. The study reveals the importance of the China's infrastructure and public facilities to support child-rearing to increase the fertility rate among couples of child-bearing age, which in turn will reduce the burden associated with an aging society."
https://openalex.org/W2969719818,"Previous research finds that both men and women perceive sexualized women as lacking in certain human qualities such as mental capacity and moral status. The mechanism underlying this effect, however, is unclear. The present two studies test how appearance-based judgements affect the degree to which a broad sample of women are objectified. In Study 1 (N = 279), full-body images of women wearing different clothing outfits were rated by male and female participants on perceived attractiveness, sexual intent and age. In Study 2, male and female participants (N = 1,695) viewed these same images from Study 1 and rated them on two dimensions of objectification (agency and patiency). We analyzed associations between these dimensions of objectification and the averaged appearance-based perceptions from Study 1. We find that women perceived as more open to casual sex are attributed less mental capacity and less moral status. We also find that participants tend to associate attractiveness with greater mental and moral status in women, but we find only limited evidence that perceived age influences objectification. Our findings suggest that although positive attractiveness biases may mitigate the amount a woman is objectified, greater female objectification may be prompted by observers’ negative stereotypes of promiscuous women."
https://openalex.org/W2969783937,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus that grows in macrophages and causes acute pneumonia in pigs. PRRSV causes devastating losses to the porcine industry. However, due to its high antigenic variability and poorly understood immunopathogenesis, there is currently no effective vaccine or treatment to control PRRSV infection. The common occurrence of PRRSV infection with bacterial infections as well as its inflammatory-driven pathobiology raises the question of the value of antibiotics with immunomodulating properties for the treatment of the disease it causes. The macrolide antibiotic Tulathromycin (TUL) has been found to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties in cattle and pigs. The aim of this study was to characterize the anti-viral and immunomodulating properties of TUL in PRRSV-infected porcine macrophages. Our findings indicate that blood monocyte-derived macrophages are readily infected by PRRSV and can be used as an effective cellular model to study PRRSV pathogenesis. TUL did not change intracellular or extracellular viral titers, not did it alter viral receptors (CD163 and CD169) expression on porcine macrophages. In contrast, TUL exhibited potent immunomodulating properties, which therefore occurred in the absence of any direct antiviral effects against PRRSV. TUL had an additive effect with PRRSV on the induction of macrophage apoptosis, and inhibited virus-induced necrosis. TUL significantly attenuated PRRSV-induced macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling (CXCL-8 and mitochondrial ROS production) and prevented PRRSV inhibition of non-opsonized and opsonized phagocytic function. Together, these data demonstrate that TUL inhibits PRRSV-induced inflammatory responses in porcine macrophages and protects against the phagocytic impairment caused by the virus. Research in live pigs is warranted to assess the potential clinical benefits of this antibiotic in the context of virally induced inflammation and tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W2969473840,"Expression of FosB gene in striatum is essential in addiction establishment. Activated glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) induce FosB gene expression in response to stressor. Therefore, elevation of FosB expression in striatum serves as one mechanism by which stress increases risk for addiction. In this study, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to investigate whether chronic stress result in histone modifications at FosB gene promoter in striatum and how these histone modifications affect FosB expression and the establishment of addiction behavior after administration of drugs of abuse. Animals were randomly assigned to three groups: Electric foot shock (EFS) group received 7-day EFS to induce chronic stress; electric foot shock plus mifepristone (EFS + Mif) group were injected with mifepristone, a nonspecific GRs antagonist, before EFS; control group did not receive any EFS. All groups then received 2-day conditioned place preference (CPP) training with morphine (5 mg/kg body weight) to test vulnerability to drug addiction. Before and after morphine administration, FosB mRNA in striatum was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Levels of histone H3/H4 acetylation and histone H3K4 dimethylation at FosB promoter in striatum after morphine administration were measured by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) plus real-time PCR. EFS group had stronger place preference to morphine and had significantly higher level of FosB mRNA in striatum than the other two groups. H3K4 dimethylation was 2.6-fold higher in EFS group than control group, while no statistical difference in H3/H4 acetylation. Mifepristone administration before EFS decreased histone H3K4 dimethylation and FosB mRNA in striatum, and also diminished morphine-induced conditioned place preference. Altogether, increased level of H3K4 dimethylation at FosB promoter in striatum is partially dependent on the activation of GR and responsible for the elevated level of morphine-induced FosB mRNA in chronic stressed animals."
https://openalex.org/W2969618206,"Post-harvest change in the colour of green field pea (Pisum sativum L.) is undesirable as this impacts the visual quality and market value of the seed. To date, there is no standard, objective method to determine bleaching. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an objective method for scoring bleaching based on colour reflectance spectra, measured both by spectrophotometer and multispectral Image Analysis (IA). Green field pea seeds were sorted into samples of uniform colour and these were used to train the model. Spectra calculated from multispectral images (with colour bands at 405,470,530,590,660 and 850nm) were matched to the spectrophotometer output through multiple linear regression. All spectra were transformed to emphasize the wavelength regions most impacted during bleaching, following which two critical reflectance values were scaled to a single bleaching score. The bleaching assessment method was tested in a time-course experiment comprising seeds from five green-pea genotypes stored for six months. Each sample was divided into two so that half of the seeds were stored in the dark and the remainder were exposed to controlled light to exaggerate bleaching. Throughout this period, the samples were imaged at six-weekly intervals. Assessment of bleaching by the IA method agreed well with spectrophotometer measurements, achieving a Lin's concordance statistic of 0.99 and 0.96 for the calibration and time-course samples respectively. The IA method proved more versatile because assessments could be made on individual seeds enabling the computation of bleaching uniformity within each sample. This method captured differences between genotypes in the extent, rate and uniformity of bleaching. All genotypes exhibited susceptibility to bleaching when stored under the controlled light conditions. Excell was observed to be the most susceptible genotype with the greatest bleaching-rate and OZB1308 displayed the most colour-stability."
https://openalex.org/W2969607994,"Competition is a major factor structuring plant communities and controlling their productivity. The functional similarity between the interacting species and the context resource availability are assumed to be most critical factors that modulate the strength, sign, and outcome of plant competition, yet their roles and interactions are subjected to debate. In a glasshouse experiment, we constructed monocultures and bi-specific cultures of three common perennial grasses of Mediterranean drylands, the short grass Brachypodium retusum and the tussock grasses Stipa tenacissima and Lygeum spartum, and investigated how the functional similarity between these species modulate their interactions and culture productivity under contrasting levels of water availability. Regardless the degree of functional similarity between the interacting species, B. retusum consistently exhibited a greater competitive ability than the other two species, followed by L. spartum, and with S. tenacissima behaving as the weakest competitor. Bi-specific cultures of B. retusum and either L. spartum or S. tenacissima produced higher biomass than the average biomass of the respective monocultures (i.e. overyielding), whereas the combination of the most similar species, L. spartum—S. tenacissima, which exhibited the highest competition symmetry (i.e., the more similar mutual impact), did not show any significant overyielding. Higher water availability increased productivity and promoted transgressive overyielding for the most dissimilar species, B. retusum and L. spartum, which however exhibited intermediate competition asymmetry. This study calls attention to the thin line between differences in functional traits and competition asymmetry that could eventually lead to either competitive exclusion or resource partitioning and coexistence."

The goal of the current study was to further fine-map two genomic regions on rat chromosome 1 with opposing blood pressure effects (BP QTL1b1 and BP QTL1b1a), the homologous region of which on human chromosome 15 harbors BP QTLs. Two new substrains were constructed and studied from the previously reported BP QTL1b1, one having significantly lower systolic BP by 17 mmHg than that of the salt-sensitive (S) rat (P = 0.007). The new limits of BP QTL1b1 were between 134.09 Mb and 135.40 Mb with a 43% improvement from the previous 2.31 Mb to the current 1.31 Mb interval containing 4 protein-coding genes (Rgma, Chd2, Fam174b, and St8sia2), 2 predicted miRNAs, and 4 lncRNAs. One new substrain was constructed and studied from the previously reported BPQTL1b1a having a significantly higher systolic BP by 22 mmHg (P = 0.006) than that of the S rat. The new limits of BPQTL1b1a were between 133.53 Mb and 134.52 Mb with a 32% improvement from the previous1.45 Mb to the current 990.21 Kb interval containing 1 protein-coding gene, Mctp2, and a lncRNA. The congenic segments of these two BP QTLs overlapped between 134.09 Mb and 134.52 Mb. No exonic variants were detected in any of the genes. These findings reiterate complexity of genetic regulation of BP within QTL regions, where elements beyond protein-coding sequences could be factors in controlling BP."
https://openalex.org/W2969852955,"Background Influenza virus infection (IVI) was reported to be associated with minor cardiac changes, mostly those detected on electrocardiogram with and without elevated blood markers of myocardial injury; however, the characteristics of myocardial involvement in association with IVI are poorly understood. This study used echocardiographic tissue imaging (tissue Doppler, strain, and strain rate) to evaluate changes in left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) myocardial function after IVI. Methods and results We examined 20 adult individuals (mean age, 43 years) at 2 and 4 weeks after diagnosis of IVI. For myocardial functional variables, we obtained LV global longitudinal strain (GLS), LV early diastolic strain rate (e'sr), LA strain, and LA stiffness (E/e’/LA strain), in addition to data on tissue Doppler (s’, e’, and a’) and myocardial performance index. Blood markers of myocardial injury were also examined. During follow-up, there were no significant changes in global chamber function such as LV ejection fraction, E/e’, and LA volume. However, significant changes in myocardial function were observed, namely, in s’ (8.0 ± 1.6 cm/s to 9.3 ± 1.5 cm/s; p = 0.01), e’ (10.2 ± 2.8 cm/s to 11.4 ± 3.0 cm/s; p < 0.001), e’sr (1.43 ± 0.44 1/s to 1.59 ± 0.43 1/s; p = 0.005), and LA strain (35 ± 8% to 40 ± 12%; p = 0.025), and the myocardial performance index (0.52 ± 0.20 to 0.38 ± 0.09; p = 0.009), but not in a’, LA stiffness, or GLS. Cardiac troponin T and creatinine kinase isoenzyme MB were not elevated significantly at any examination. Conclusions Myocardial dysfunction during IVI recovery appeared to be transient particularly in the absence of myocardial injury. Echocardiographic tissue imaging may be useful to detect subclinical cardiac changes in association with IVI."
https://openalex.org/W2969868610,"Clinical outcomes of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) secondary to membranous nephropathy (MN) have not been well described. This study aimed to evaluate patient and/or allograft outcomes of dialysis or kidney transplantation in patients with ESKD secondary to MN.All adult patients with ESKD commencing renal replacement therapy in Australia and New Zealand from January 1998 to December 2010 were extracted retrospectively from ANZDATA registry on 31st December 2013. Outcomes of MN were compared to other causes of ESKD. In a secondary analysis, outcomes of MN were compared to all patients with ESKD due to other forms of glomerulonephritis.Of 32,788 included patients, 417 (1.3%) had MN. Compared to other causes of ESKD, MN experienced lower mortality on dialysis (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.68-0.92, p = 0.002) and following kidney transplantation (aHR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.97, p = 0.04), had a higher risk of death-censored kidney allograft failure (aHR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.00-2.41, p = 0.05) but comparable risk of overall kidney allograft failure (aHR 1.35, 95% CI 0.91-2.01, p = 0.13). Similar results were obtained using competing-risk regression analyses. MN patients were significantly more likely to receive a kidney transplant (aHR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16-1.63, p<0.001) and to experience primary kidney disease recurrence in the allograft (aHR 4.92, 95% CI 3.02-8.01, p<0.001). Compared to other forms of glomerulonephritis, MN experienced comparable dialysis and transplant patient survival, but higher rates of kidney transplantation, primary renal disease recurrence and death-censored allograft failure.MN was associated with superior survival on dialysis and following kidney transplantation compared to patients with other causes of ESKD, and comparable patient survival compared to patients with other forms of glomerulonephritis. However, patients with MN exhibited a higher rate of death-censored allograft loss as a result of primary kidney disease recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2969499774,"To explore the use of Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) in evaluating angiogenesis in a xenograft nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) model in nude mice and the evolution of CEUS parameters according to the growth of NPC.Nude mice were divided into three groups according to experiments conducted at various times from tumor implantation (8 mice/group; group A: 4 weeks from implantation; group B:6 weeks from implantation; group C:8 weeks from implantation). CNE-2 cells were transplanted in 24 nude mice and CEUS evaluations of the tumors were performed at 4, 6 or 8 weeks from implantation. CEUS parametric perfusion images and pathological findings were recorded. R version 3.4.4 software was used to analyze the CEUS parameters and pathological findings.One-way anova analysis indicated statistically significant differences among the three groups with the parameters of peak intensity (PI) (p<0.001), area wash in (AWI) (p<0.001), area wash out (AWO) (p<0.001) and tumor volumes (p<0.001).Pearson correlation coefficient analysis indicated that microvessel density (MVD) was correlated with tumor volume (r = 0.644, p = 0.001), PI (r = 0.904, p<0.0001), AWI (r = 0.547, p = 0.008) and AWO (r = 0.744, P<0.0001). Tumor volume was correlated with MVD (r = 0.644, p = 0.001), PI (r = 0.625, p = 0.002), AWI (r = 0.528, p = 0.012) and AWO (r = 0.784, p<0.001). The percentage of necrosis in histological sections was correlated with the percentage of CEUS unperfused area (r = 0.446,p = 0.038). Spearman rank correlation coefficient analysis indicated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was correlated with PI (r = 0.462, P = 0.032). Welch t test indicated PI, AWI and AWO parameters were significantly lower than that of kidneys (p<0.001, p = 0.009, p = 0.005).The CEUS parameters PI, AWI and AWO indirectly reflect the MVD and the tumor volume in our model of subcutaneous transplanted NPC in nude mice, providing precious information on angiogenesis and tumor growth. VEGF may play a role in promoting angiogenesis of NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2969411943,"Open source software has been widely used in various industries due to its openness and flexibility, but it also brings potential security problems. Therefore, security analysis is required before using open source software. The current mainstream open source software vulnerability analysis technology is based on source code, and there are problems such as false positives, false negatives and restatements. In order to solve the problems, based on the further study of behavior feature extraction and vulnerability detection technology, a method of using dynamic behavior features to detect open source software vulnerabilities is proposed. Firstly, the relationship between open source software vulnerability and API call sequence is studied. Then, the behavioral risk vulnerability database of open source software is proposed as a support for vulnerability detection. In addition, the CNN-IndRNN classification model is constructed by improving the Independently Recurrent Neural Net-work (IndRNN) algorithm and applies to open source software security vulnerability detection. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed open source software security vulnerability detection method based on dynamic behavior features."
https://openalex.org/W2969720432,"Background The debate whether ""asymptomatic hyperuricemia"" should be treated is still ongoing. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to analyze whether hyperuricema in the elderly is associated with joint pain. Methods and findings Participants in the population-based AGES-Reykjavik Study (males 2195, females 2975, mean age 76(6)) answered standardized questions about joint pain. In addition they recorded intermittent hand joint pain by marking a diagram of the hand. In males, no association was found between hyperuricemia and pain. Females however, showed a positive association between hyperuricemia and joint pain at many sites. After adjustment for age, BMI and hand osteoarthritis however, only intermittent hand joint pain (OR 1.30(1.07–1.58), p = 0.008) and intermittent pain in ≥10 hand joints (OR 1.75(1.32–2.31), p<0.001) remained significant. The best model for describing the relationship between serum uric acid levels (SUA) and intermittent hand joint pain in ≥10 joints was non-linear with a cut-off at 372 μmol/L. The attributable surplus number of symptomatic females with SUA ≥372 μmol/L was approximately 2.0% of the study population for those reporting pain in ≥10 hand joints. Next after having severe hand osteoarthritis, SUA ≥372 was an independent predictive factor of intermittent pain in ≥10 hand joints. Intermittent hand joint pain was also an independent risk factor for worse general health description. Conclusion Results from this population based study indicate that hyperuricemia in elderly females may be a rather frequent cause of intermittent hand joint pain, often in many joints. The most likely explanation relates to low-grade urate crystal induced inflammation. Our data do not allow for assessment of the severity of symptoms or whether they merit specific treatment, but intermittent hand joint pain was an independent predictor of worse general health. These findings may be an important contribution to the debate on whether hyperuricemia should be treated."
https://openalex.org/W2969323021,"The aims of this study were: a) to describe the pathological and laboratory findings in a case series of stranding and mortality associated with ingestion of large amounts of sea urchins in loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), and b) to alert veterinarians and biologists involved in sea turtle conservation of this cause of stranding and/or death.The six loggerheads studied were stranded on the coasts of Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain, between 2008 and 2015. Post mortem studies included pathological, microbiological, and sea urchin species identification procedures.All turtles showed severe intestinal impaction caused by large amounts of sea urchins, mainly affecting the colon and the caudal half of the small intestine. Histologically, severe focal fibrinonecrotic enteritis was diagnosed in two turtles. In the remaining turtles, lesions ranged from mild desquamation of the intestinal epithelium to severe congestion of the blood vessels of lamina propria, submucosa, muscular and serosa, and edema. Vibrio sp. was isolated from the spleen and intestinal mucosa of a loggerhead in which focal fibrinonecrotic enteritis had been diagnosed. In five turtles, all the remains were fragments from long-spined sea urchins (Diadema africanum); the last turtle contained a mixture of long-spined sea urchin (90%) and purple sea urchin (Sphaerechinus granularis) (10%) remains.Although the prevalence of this cause of stranding was low (< 1.6%) compared to other mortality causes, continued overfishing and anthropogenic climate change could increase its incidence. Intestinal impaction with large amounts of sea urchins should be included in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases in sea turtles, and the possible toxic effect of some sea urchin species on sea turtles should also be investigated."
