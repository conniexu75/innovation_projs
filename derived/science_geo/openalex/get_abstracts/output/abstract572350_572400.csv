Differences in median biomarker concentrations between groups, and associations with the free androgen index (FAI; Testosterone/SHBG x100).The cluster analysis identified leptin, RBP-4, DPP-IV and adiponectin as potential discriminative markers for HA-PCOS with a specifically strong correlation in cases with increased BMI. Leptin (R2 = 0.219) and adiponectin (R2 = 0.182) showed the strongest correlation with the FAI. When comparing median protein concentrations adult PCOS women with or without hyperandrogenemia, the most profound differences were observed for leptin (P < 0.001), DPP-IV (P = 0.005), and adiponectin (P < 0.001). Adjusting for age, BMI and multiple testing attenuated all differences. In PCOS offspring, MMP-9 (P = 0.001) and S100A8 (P < 0.001) concentrations were significantly higher compared to a healthy matched reference population, even after correcting for age and BMI and adjustment for multiple testing.In this preliminary investigation we observed significant differences in adipocytokines between women with or without hyperandrogenic PCOS and non-PCOS controls, mostly influenced by BMI. Leptin and adiponectin showed the strongest correlation with the FAI in adult women with PCOS. In PCOS offspring other inflammatory biomarkers (MMP-9, S100A8) were increased, suggesting that these children may exhibit increased chronic low-grade inflammation. Additional research is required to confirm results of the current exploratory investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2548993203,"A subgroup of breast cancers has several metabolic compartments. The mechanisms by which metabolic compartmentalization develop in tumors are poorly characterized. TP53 inducible glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) is a bisphosphatase that reduces glycolysis and is highly expressed in carcinoma cells in the majority of human breast cancers. Hence we set out to determine the effects of TIGAR expression on breast carcinoma and fibroblast glycolytic phenotype and tumor growth. The overexpression of this bisphosphatase in carcinoma cells induces expression of enzymes and transporters involved in the catabolism of lactate and glutamine. Carcinoma cells overexpressing TIGAR have higher oxygen consumption rates and ATP levels when exposed to glutamine, lactate, or the combination of glutamine and lactate. Coculture of TIGAR overexpressing carcinoma cells and fibroblasts compared with control cocultures induce more pronounced glycolytic differences between carcinoma and fibroblast cells. Carcinoma cells overexpressing TIGAR have reduced glucose uptake and lactate production. Conversely, fibroblasts in coculture with TIGAR overexpressing carcinoma cells induce HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) activation with increased glucose uptake, increased 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3), and lactate dehydrogenase-A expression. We also studied the effect of this enzyme on tumor growth. TIGAR overexpression in carcinoma cells increases tumor growth in vivo with increased proliferation rates. However, a catalytically inactive variant of TIGAR did not induce tumor growth. Therefore, TIGAR expression in breast carcinoma cells promotes metabolic compartmentalization and tumor growth with a mitochondrial metabolic phenotype with lactate and glutamine catabolism. Targeting TIGAR warrants consideration as a potential therapy for breast cancer. A subgroup of breast cancers has several metabolic compartments.

There is metabolic coupling with lactate transfer between highly glycolytic carcinoma cells and carcinoma cells with reduced glycolysis in models of vulvar and colon cancer (2.Sonveaux P. Végran F.

TIGAR is the only known phosphatase glycolytic modulator regulated by TP53. It is unknown if TIGAR induces aggressive breast cancer. The human TIGAR gene is similar to the bisphosphatase domain of the glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB) (7.Bensaad K. Tsuruta A. Selak M.A. Vidal M.N.

TIGAR decreases glycolysis by functioning as a bisphosphatase that reduces levels of intracellular fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (7.Bensaad K. Tsuruta A. Selak M.A. Vidal M.N. Nakano K. Bartrons R. Gottlieb E. Vousden K.H.

Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) is a key glycolytic enzyme that converts fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. PFK-1 is allosterically activated by Fru-2,6-P2 (10.Okar D.A. Manzano A. Navarro-Sabatè A. Riera L. Bartrons R. Lange A.J. PFK-2/FBPase-2: maker and breaker of the essential biofactor fructose-2,6-bisphosphate.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 30-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Also, Fru-2,6-P2 is an inhibitor of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, which opposes the activity of PFK-1 by converting fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate (10.Okar D.A. Manzano A. Navarro-Sabatè A. Riera L. Bartrons R. Lange A.J. PFK-2/FBPase-2: maker and breaker of the essential biofactor fructose-2,6-bisphosphate.Trends Biochem.

The synthesis and breakdown of Fru-2,6-P2 depends on the bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase isoenzymes, products of four genes (PFKFB1–4) that code for the different PFKFB isoenzymes and that have distinct cell expression patterns and display different kinase/bisphosphatase activity ratios and control by different protein kinases (10.Okar D.A.

In tumor cells, the concentration of Fru-2,6-P2 is generally elevated due to overexpression and activation of PFKFB3, which has opposite effects of TIGAR (11.Bartrons R. Caro J.

Conversely, TIGAR depletion increases glycolytic flux by increasing the activity of PFK-1 and the glycolytic flux by increasing Fru-2,6-P2 levels (7.Bensaad K. Tsuruta A. Selak M.A. Vidal M.N.

It is unknown if TIGAR modulates catabolism of other substrates such as lactate and glutamine, which have been shown to be alternate catabolites to glucose for carcinoma cells (1.DeNicola G.M. Cantley L.C. Cancer's fuel choice: new flavors for a picky eater.Mol. Cell. 2015; 60: 514-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). TIGAR expression has been shown to be inversely associated with glycolysis as TIGAR expression was inversely associated with 2-deoxyglucose uptake on PET scans in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (15.Zhou X. Xie W. Li Q. Zhang Y. Zhang J. Zhao X. Liu J. Huang G. TIGAR is correlated with maximal standardized uptake value on FDG-PET and survival in non-small cell lung cancer.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e80576Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TIGAR regulates hexokinase 2 (HK2) activity and increases mitochondrial membrane potential, but the effect of TIGAR on mitochondrial metabolism, oxygen consumption rates, and ATP generation is unknown (16.Cheung E.C. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Mitochondrial localization of TIGAR under hypoxia stimulates HK2 and lowers ROS and cell death.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 20491-20496Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In sum, TIGAR reduces glycolysis, but its effects on the catabolism of other substrates and mitochondrial metabolism is poorly characterized. TIGAR has been reported to mediate human cancer aggressiveness, although the mechanism is unclear, and its effect in breast cancer is unknown. In addition to reducing glycolysis, TIGAR reduces apoptosis (7.Bensaad K. Tsuruta A. Selak M.A. Vidal M.N. Nakano K. Bartrons R. Gottlieb E. Vousden K.H. TIGAR, a p53-inducible regulator of glycolysis and apoptosis.Cell. 2006; 126: 107-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). TIGAR is overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and genetic overexpression increases tumor growth with carcinoma cell growth, colony formation, migration, and invasion with NFκB activation in carcinoma cells (17.Zhao M. Fan J. Liu Y. Yu Y. Xu J. Wen Q. Zhang J. Fu S. Wang B. Xiang L. Feng J. Wu J. Yang L.

Zheng J.C. Ge S. Knockdown of TIGAR by RNA interference induces apoptosis and autophagy in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 437: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). TIGAR down-regulation in HepG2 carcinoma cells reduces the size of hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts (19.Xie J.M. Li B. Yu H.P. Gao Q.G. Li W. Wu H.R. Qin Z.H. TIGAR has a dual role in cancer cell survival through regulating apoptosis and autophagy.Cancer Res. 2014; 74: 5127-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). TIGAR reduces apoptosis rates of non-small cell lung cancer H-1299 and osteosarcoma U2OS cells (7.Bensaad K. Tsuruta A. Selak M.A. Vidal M.N. Nakano K. Bartrons R. Gottlieb E. Vousden K.H. TIGAR, a p53-inducible regulator of glycolysis and apoptosis.Cell. 2006; 126: 107-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). TIGAR is also overexpressed in the majority of glioblastomas, protecting cells from starvation-induced cell death by up-regulating respiration and improving cellular redox homeostasis (20.Wanka C. Steinbach J.P. Rieger J. Tp53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) protects glioma cells from starvation-induced cell death by up-regulating respiration and improving cellular redox homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 33436-33446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Radiosensitization of glioma cells also occurs with TIGAR knockdown (14.Peña-Rico M.A. Calvo-Vidal M.N. Villalonga-Planells R. Martínez-Soler F. Giménez-Bonafé P. Navarro-Sabaté À. Tortosa A.

ATM-NFκB axis-driven TIGAR regulates sensitivity of glioma cells to radiomimetics in the presence of TNFα.Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4: e615Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TIGAR is required for proliferation of small intestine cells (22.Cheung E.C. Athineos D. Lee P. Ridgway R.A. Lambie W. Nixon C. Strathdee D. Blyth K. Sansom O.J. Vousden K.H. TIGAR is required for efficient intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis.Dev. Cell. 2013; 25: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). TIGAR null mice have decreased tumorigenesis and increased survival in a model in which the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is deleted in LGR5+ intestinal stem cells (22.Cheung E.C.

However, no reports have described the effect of TIGAR on breast cancer tumor growth in vivo. Also, the role of TIGAR in the low rates of glycolysis and apoptosis with high proliferation observed in human breast cancer is unknown. Breast tumors have high expression of mitochondrial biogenesis transcription factors and mitochondrial markers of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (26.Wallace D.C. Mitochondria and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar) (27.Sotgia F. Whitaker-Menezes D. Martinez-Outschoorn U.E. Salem A.F. Tsirigos A. Lamb R. Sneddon S. Hulit J. Howell A.

Mitochondria “fuel” breast cancer metabolism: fifteen markers of mitochondrial biogenesis label epithelial cancer cells, but are excluded from adjacent stromal cells.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11: 4390-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Multiple metabolic compartments exist in human malignancies (28.Martinez-Outschoorn U.E. Lisanti M.P. Sotgia F. Catabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growth.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2014; 25: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Metabolic compartmentalization occurs in breast cancer with highly glycolytic stromal cells and cancer cells with high OXPHOS (28.Martinez-Outschoorn U.E. Lisanti M.P. Sotgia F. Catabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growth.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2014; 25: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). There are no data on the metabolic effects of TIGAR expression in breast cancer and if it plays a role in metabolic compartmentalization or heterogeneity in tumors. We hypothesize that TIGAR expression in carcinoma cells induces aggressive disease with utilization of alternative catabolites to glucose and metabolic compartmentalization. To investigate the effects of TIGAR on markers of lactate and glutamine utilization, we overexpressed TIGAR in breast carcinoma cells. TIGAR overexpression up-regulated moderately monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 1, A and B). MCT2 is a lactate importer. TIGAR also up-regulates lactate dehydrogenase B (LDH-B), which is the enzyme that converts lactate into pyruvate for mitochondrial metabolism (Fig. 1C) and TIGAR up-regulates glutaminase 1 (GLS1) modestly, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in glutamine catabolism and converts glutamine to glutamate (Fig. 1D). Conversely, glutamate ammonia ligase (GLUL), which is the enzyme that mediates glutamine synthesis from glutamate and ammonia, was down-regulated with TIGAR overexpression (Fig. 1E). TIGAR markedly decreased the NADP+/NADPH ratio (Fig. 1, F and G), which is consistent with increasing flux through the pentose phosphate pathway. To investigate the effects of TIGAR on mitochondrial biogenesis, we studied the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 (PGC1) and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1). TIGAR overexpression induced these markers of mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 2A). To investigate the effects of TIGAR and exposure to glutamine and lactate on OXPHOS, we studied oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in control and TIGAR-overexpressing carcinoma cells. Oxygen consumption rates were higher for TIGAR overexpressing carcinoma cells exposed to glutamine, lactate, or glutamine and lactate compared with carcinoma cells expressing the control vector (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). TIGAR overexpressing carcinoma cells exposed to glutamine have a 1.2-fold greater OCR than control carcinoma cells exposed to glutamine (p < 0.05) and 1.5-fold greater OCR when exposed to lactate or glutamine and lactate than the control carcinoma cells exposed to the same conditions (p < 0.05). OCRs were not increased by glutamine or lactate in the absence of TIGAR overexpression. TIGAR overexpressing carcinoma cells had lower OCR than control cells (0.8-fold) when cultured with glucose but without glutamine and lactate (p < 0.05). Next, we studied the markers of OXPHOS metabolism MITONEET, and Transporter of the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane Member 20 (TOMM20). Both MITONEET and TOMM20 are up-regulated by TIGAR (Fig. 2C). TOMM20 overexpression in carcinoma cells also increased expression of TIGAR (Fig. 2D). Exposure of carcinoma cells to lactate, glutamine, or glutamine and lactate increased ATP generation (Fig. 2E). We then exposed control and TIGAR-overexpressing carcinoma cells to 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3PO), which is a PFKFB3 inhibitor that reduces Fru-2,6-P2 levels. Control cells exposed to 3PO do not have a significant change in ATP levels (Fig. 2F). However, TIGAR-overexpressing cells exposed to 3PO increased ATP levels (Fig. 2F). To investigate stromal-epithelial interactions, we used a coculture model system composed of 1) human fibroblasts immortalized with the telomerase catalytic domain (hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts) and 2) T47D or MCF7 cells, which are well established breast cancer cell lines. TIGAR and PFKFB3 are markers of glycolysis, although they have opposite effects. TIGAR mRNA expression was increased 1.5-fold in T47D cells in coculture (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3A) and 1.6-fold in MCF7 cells in coculture (p < 0.05), whereas PFKFB3 mRNA expression was reduced 1.9-fold in MCF7 cells in coculture (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). No statistically significant difference in PFKFB3 mRNA expression was noted in T47D cells in coculture (Fig. 3A). Fibroblasts induced TIGAR expression in carcinoma cells (Fig. 3C), and TIGAR induced aggressive carcinoma cells with increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Carcinoma cells cocultured with fibroblasts had a 4.7-fold increase in DNA synthesis at the expense of G0-G1 and G2-M (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3D). Carcinoma cells also had a 2-fold decreased apoptosis rate when in coculture with fibroblasts (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3E). We studied 2-deoxyglucose uptake in T47D cells overexpressing TIGAR in coculture with fibroblasts by measuring fluorescence of 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG), which is a green fluorescent 2-deoxyglucose compound. 2-NBDG uptake correlates with glycolysis with higher uptake indicating increased glycolysis. T47D cells overexpressing TIGAR had a 1.3-fold reduced 2-NBDG uptake compared with control T47D cells in coculture (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A). T47D cells overexpressing TIGAR in homotypic culture had no statistically significant difference in 2-NBDG uptake compared with control T47D cells (data not shown). T47D cells overexpressing TIGAR had a 1.9-fold reduced lactate production compared with control T47D cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B). TOMM20 overexpression in carcinoma cells also reduced lactate production 1.9-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4C). Lactate production is a measure of glycolysis with lower lactate levels indicating lower glycolysis. Hence the effect of TIGAR on glycolysis can be phenocopied by expression of TOMM20. Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) is the main importer of lactate into cells and is inversely related to rates of glycolysis. TIGAR overexpression in carcinoma cells up-regulated MCT1 protein expression (Fig. 4D). Conversely TIGAR down-regulation in carcinoma cells using CRISPR-Cas9 reduced MCT1 expression (Fig. 4E–F). Next we studied the effect of TIGAR overexpression in T47D cells on fibroblast metabolism. Fibroblasts cocultured with T47D cells overexpressing TIGAR had a 1.2-fold increase in 2-NBDG uptake compared with fibroblasts in control cocultures (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A). Glucose uptake in fibroblasts was measured by quantifying green fluorescence of the 2-deoxyglucose compound 2-NBDG. 2-Deoxyglucose and 2-NBDG uptake is an additional measure of glycolysis with lower uptake indicating reduced glycolysis. PFKFB3 and LDH-A expression increased in fibroblasts cocultured with TIGAR overexpressing carcinoma cells (Fig. 5, B and C). PFKFB3 and LDH-A are markers of glycolysis. LDH-B expression is reduced with coculture with TIGAR overexpressing carcinoma cells (Fig. 5C). LDH-B has opposite effects to LDH-A, converting lactate to pyruvate. We next assessed the effect of TIGAR on activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in fibroblasts by using a HIF1A luciferase reporter as HIF1A is one of the main glycolytic transcription factors. NIH3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with a HIF1A luciferase reporter were cultured with control T47D cells or TIGAR-overexpressing T47D cells. Activation of HIF1A is increased by 1.6-fold (p < 0.05) in fibroblasts cocultured with T47D cells overexpressing TIGAR cells in 0.5% O2 hypoxia compared with control coculture conditions (Fig. 5D). Note that there was no significant change in HIF1A activation in normoxia between control coculture and coculture with T47D cells overexpressing TIGAR. Fibroblasts exposed to carcinoma cells have reduced TIGAR expression, but overexpression of TIGAR in fibroblasts led to 1.2-fold reduced glucose uptake compared with control fibroblasts (Fig. 5E). In sum, TIGAR overexpression in carcinoma cells induced a glycolytic phenotype in fibroblasts. T47D cells were cultured alone or with fibroblasts and exposed to tamoxifen. TIGAR overexpression in carcinoma cells exposed to tamoxifen induced apoptosis resistance with a 1.2-fold reduction in homotypic culture and a 1.4-fold reduction in coculture with fibroblasts (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6A). In contrast, TIGAR-overexpressing carcinoma cells were more sensitive to apoptosis by mitochondrial modulators. Metformin, which is an OXPHOS complex I inhibitor, doxycycline, which inhibits mitochondrial translation, and ABT-199, which inhibits BCL2 as a single agent or in combination induced higher rates of apoptosis in TIGAR-overexpressing T47D cells than controls (Fig. 6, B–E). Exposure to lactate in MCF7 cells led to increased TIGAR and BCL2 expression with reduced MCT4 expression (Fig. 6F). Exposure to tamoxifen in MCF7 cells decreased expression of TIGAR, BCL-XL, BCL2, MITONEET, and labile subunits of OXPHOS (Fig. 6, G–H). Overexpression of MITONEET in MCF7 cells, which is a marker of OXPHOS, reduced apoptosis rates in coculture with tamoxifen 1.3-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6I). MDA-MB-231, T47D, and MCF7 cells overexpressing TIGAR and control cells were injected into the mammary gland of nude female mice. MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing TIGAR"
https://openalex.org/W2547021583,"Lysyl hydroxylase 2 (LH2) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysine residues in the telopeptides of fibrillar collagens, which leads to the formation of stable collagen cross-links. Recently we reported that LH2 enhances the metastatic propensity of lung cancer by increasing the amount of stable hydroxylysine aldehyde-derived collagen cross-links (HLCCs), which generate a stiffer tumor stroma (Chen, Y., et al. (2015) J. Clin. Invest. 125, 125, 1147–1162). It is generally accepted that LH2 modifies procollagen α chains on the endoplasmic reticulum before the formation of triple helical procollagen molecules. Herein, we report that LH2 is also secreted and modifies collagen in the extracellular space. Analyses of lung cancer cell lines demonstrated that LH2 is present in the cell lysates and the conditioned media in a dimeric, active form in both compartments. LH2 co-localized with collagen fibrils in the extracellular space in human lung cancer specimens and in orthotopic lung tumors generated by injection of a LH2-expressing human lung cancer cell line into nude mice. LH2 depletion in MC3T3 osteoblastic cells impaired the formation of HLCCs, resulting in an increase in the unmodified lysine aldehyde-derived collagen cross-link (LCC), and the addition of recombinant LH2 to the media of LH2-deficient MC3T3 cells was sufficient to rescue HLCC formation in the extracellular matrix. The finding that LH2 modifies collagen in the extracellular space challenges the current view that LH2 functions solely on the endoplasmic reticulum and could also have important implications for cancer biology."
https://openalex.org/W2546580615,"Bacteria behave differently in space, as indicated by reports of reduced lag phase, higher final cell counts, enhanced biofilm formation, increased virulence, and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics. These phenomena are theorized, at least in part, to result from reduced mass transport in the local extracellular environment, where movement of molecules consumed and excreted by the cell is limited to diffusion in the absence of gravity-dependent convection. However, to date neither empirical nor computational approaches have been able to provide sufficient evidence to confirm this explanation. Molecular genetic analysis findings, conducted as part of a recent spaceflight investigation, support the proposed model. This investigation indicated an overexpression of genes associated with starvation, the search for alternative energy sources, increased metabolism, enhanced acetate production, and other systematic responses to acidity-all of which can be associated with reduced extracellular mass transport."
https://openalex.org/W2548202339,"Swallowing dysfunction caused by stroke is a risk factor for aspiration pneumonia. Tongue pressure measurement is a simple and noninvasive method for evaluating swallowing dysfunction. We have hypothesized that low tongue pressure may be able to predict pneumonia occurrence in acute stroke patients. Tongue pressure was measured using balloon-type equipment in 220 acute stroke patients. The modified Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA) score was evaluated independently on the same day. Tongue pressure was measured every week thereafter. An improvement in tongue pressure was observed within the first 2 weeks. Receiver operating curve analysis was performed to determine the ability of tongue pressure to predict modified MASA score <95, which suggests swallowing dysfunction. The optimal cutoff for tongue pressure was 21.6 kPa (χ2 = 45.82, p<0.001, sensitivity 95.9%, specificity 91.8%, area under the curve = 0.97). The tongue pressure was significantly lower in patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia. Using a Cox proportional hazard model for pneumonia onset with a cutoff tongue pressure value of 21.6 kPa and adjustment for age, sex, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission, the tongue pressure had additional predictive power for pneumonia onset (hazard ratio, 7.95; 95% confidence interval, 2.09 to 52.11; p = 0.0013). In the group with low tongue pressure, 27 of 95 patients showed improvement of tongue pressure within 2 weeks. Pneumonia occurred frequently in patients without improvement of tongue pressure, but not in patients with improvement (31/68 and 2/27, p<0.001). Tongue pressure is a sensitive indicator for predicting pneumonia occurrence in acute stroke patients."
https://openalex.org/W2547790698,"Although the importance of light for tomato plant yield and edible fruit quality is well known, the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs), main components of phytochrome-mediated light signal transduction, have been studied almost exclusively in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, the diversity, evolution and expression profile of PIF gene subfamily in Solanum lycopersicum was characterized. Eight tomato PIF loci were identified, named SlPIF1a, SlPIF1b, SlPIF3, SlPIF4, SlPIF7a, SlPIF7b, SlPIF8a and SlPIF8b. The duplication of SlPIF1, SlPIF7 and SlPIF8 genes were dated and temporally coincided with the whole-genome triplication event that preceded tomato and potato divergence. Different patterns of mRNA accumulation in response to light treatments were observed during seedling deetiolation, dark-induced senescence, diel cycle and fruit ripening. SlPIF4 showed similar expression profile as that reported for A. thaliana homologs, indicating an evolutionary conserved function of PIF4 clade. A comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary and transcriptional data allowed proposing that duplicated SlPIFs have undergone sub- and neofunctionalization at mRNA level, pinpointing the importance of transcriptional regulation for the maintenance of duplicated genes. Altogether, the results indicate that genome polyploidization and functional divergence have played a major role in diversification of the Solanum PIF gene subfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2547706032,"A growing body of evidence supports the concept of helminths therapy in a variety of autoimmune diseases. Here, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of autoclaved Schistosoma mansoni antigen (ASMA) and Trichinella spiralis antigen (ATSA) on the clinical and immunopathological features of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Adjuvant arthritis was induced by subcutaneous and intradermal injections of complete Freund's adjuvant into the plantar surface of the right hind paw and the root of the tail, respectively. Rats were randomly assigned to serve as normal control, untreated arthritis, ASMA or ATSA-treated arthritis groups. Antigens were given by intradermal injection in two doses, two weeks apart. The development, progression of arthritic features, and the impact on animals' gait and body weight were followed up for 4 weeks. The associated changes in serum cytokines (IL-17, IFN-γ and IL-10), joints' histopathology and immunohistochemistry of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) were evaluated at the end of the study. Treatment with either ASMA or ATSA attenuated the progression of clinical features of polyarthritis, improved gait and body weight gain, reduced the elevated serum IL-17 and further increased both IFN-γ and IL-10. Histopathologically, this was associated with a remarkable regression of paws' inflammation that was limited only to the subcutaneous tissue, and a significant increase in the number of Foxp 3+ cells versus the untreated arthritis group. In conclusion, both Schistosoma mansoni and Trichinella spiralis derived antigens exerted protective effect against adjuvant arthritis with better effect achieved by ASMA treatment. This anti-arthritic activity is attributed to upregulation of the Foxp3+ Tregs, with subsequent favorable modulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The use of autoclaved parasitic antigens excludes the deleterious effects of imposing helminthic infection by using live parasites, which may pave the way to a new therapeutic modality in treating RA."
https://openalex.org/W2547119947,"In Uganda, abortion is permitted only when the life of a woman is in danger. This restriction compels the perpetuation of the practice in secrecy and often under unsafe conditions. In 2003, 294,000 induced abortions were estimated to occur each year in Uganda. Since then, no other research on abortion incidence has been conducted in the country.Data from 418 health facilities were used to estimate the number and rate of induced abortion in 2013. An indirect estimation methodology was used to calculate the annual incidence of induced abortions ─ nationally and by major regions. The use of a comparable methodology in an earlier study permits assessment of trends between 2003 and 2013.In 2013, an estimated 128,682 women were treated for abortion complications and an estimated 314,304 induced abortions occurred, both slightly up from 110,000 and 294,000 in 2003, respectively. The national abortion rate was 39 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-49, down from 51 in 2003. Regional variation in abortion rates is very large, from as high as an estimated 77 per 1,000 women 15-49 in Kampala region, to as low as 18 per 1,000 women in Western region. The overall pregnancy rate also declined from 326 to 288; however the proportion of pregnancies that were unintended increased slightly, from 49% to 52%.Unsafe abortion remains a major problem confronting Ugandan women. Although the overall pregnancy rate and the abortion rate declined in the past decade, the majority of pregnancies to Ugandan women are still unintended. These findings reflect the increase in the use of modern contraception but also suggest that a large proportion of women are still having difficulty practicing contraception effectively. Improved access to contraceptive services and abortion-related care are still needed."
https://openalex.org/W2546422483,"Recent research has suggested that polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) in the intestinal tract impact the health of animals either negatively or positively. The concentration of polyamines in the intestinal tract results from the balance of uptake and export of the intestinal bacteria. However, the mechanism of polyamine export from bacterial cells to the intestinal lumen is still unclear. In Escherichia coli, PotE was previously identified as a transporter responsible for putrescine excretion in an acidic growth environment. We observed putrescine concentration in the culture supernatant was increased from 0 to 50 μm during growth of E. coli under neutral conditions. Screening for the unidentified putrescine exporter was performed using a gene knock-out collection of E. coli, and deletion of sapBCDF significantly decreased putrescine levels in the culture supernatant. Complementation of the deletion mutant with the sapBCDF genes restored putrescine levels in the culture supernatant. Additionally, the ΔsapBCDF strain did not facilitate uptake of putrescine from the culture supernatant. Quantification of stable isotope-labeled putrescine derived from stable isotope-labeled arginine supplemented in the medium revealed that SapBCDF exported putrescine from E. coli cells to the culture supernatant. It was previously reported that SapABCDF of Salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium and Haemophilus influenzae conferred resistance toantimicrobial peptides; however, the E. coli ΔsapBCDF strain did not affect resistance to antimicrobial peptide LL-37. These results strongly suggest that the natural function of the SapBCDF proteins is the export of putrescine."
https://openalex.org/W2546801493,"Background Health systems often fail to use evidence in clinical practice. In maternal and perinatal health, the majority of maternal, fetal and newborn mortality is preventable through implementing effective interventions. To meet this challenge, WHO’s Department of Reproductive Health and Research partnered with the Knowledge Translation Program at St. Michael’s Hospital (SMH), University of Toronto, Canada to establish a collaboration on knowledge translation (KT) in maternal and perinatal health, called the GREAT Network (Guideline-driven, Research priorities, Evidence synthesis, Application of evidence, and Transfer of knowledge). We applied a systematic approach incorporating evidence and theory to identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation of WHO maternal heath recommendations in four lower-income countries and to identifying implementation strategies to address these. Methods We conducted a mixed-methods study in Myanmar, Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia. In each country, stakeholder surveys, focus group discussions and prioritization exercises were used, involving multiple groups of health system stakeholders (including administrators, policymakers, NGOs, professional associations, frontline healthcare providers and researchers). Results Despite differences in guideline priorities and contexts, barriers identified across countries were often similar. Health system level factors, including health workforce shortages, and need for strengthened drug and equipment procurement, distribution and management systems, were consistently highlighted as limiting the capacity of providers to deliver high-quality care. Evidence-based health policies to support implementation, and improve the knowledge and skills of healthcare providers were also identified. Stakeholders identified a range of tailored strategies to address local barriers and leverage facilitators. Conclusion This approach to identifying barriers, facilitators and potential strategies for improving implementation proved feasible in these four lower-income country settings. Further evaluation of the impact of implementing these strategies is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2546760054,"The emergence and rapid spread of unusual DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant rotavirus strains have been recently reported in Asia, Australia, and Europe. During rotavirus surveillance in Thailand in 2013-2014, novel DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant strains having G8P[8] genotypes (i.e., strains KKL-17, PCB-79, PCB-84, PCB-85, PCB-103, SKT-107, SWL-12, NP-130, PCB-656, SKT-457, SSKT-269, and SSL-55) were identified in stool samples from hospitalized children with severe diarrhea. In this study, we determined and characterized the complete genomes of these 12 strains (seven strains, KKL-17, PCB-79, PCB-84, PCB-85, PCB-103, SKT-107, and SWL-12, found in 2013 (2013 strains), and five, NP-130, PCB-656, SKT-457, SSKT-269, and SSL-55, in 2014 (2014 strains)). On full genomic analysis, all 12 strains showed a unique genotype constellation comprising a mixture of genogroup 1 and 2 genes: G8-P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2. With the exception of the G genotype, the unique genotype constellation of the 12 strains (P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2) was found to be shared with DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant strains. On phylogenetic analysis, six of the 11 genes of the 2013 strains (VP4, VP2, VP3, NSP1, NSP3, and NSP5) appeared to have originated from DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant strains, while the remaining four (VP7, VP6, VP1, and NSP2) and one (NSP4) gene appeared to be of bovine and human origin, respectively. Thus, the 2013 strains appeared to be reassortant strains as to DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant, bovine, bovine-like human, and/or human rotaviruses. On the other hand, five of the 11 genes of the 2014 strains (VP4, VP2, VP3, NSP1, and NSP3) appeared to have originated from DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant strains, while three (VP7, VP1, and NSP2) and one (NSP4) were assumed to be of bovine and human origin, respectively. Notably, the remaining two genes, VP6 and NSP5, of the 2014 strains appeared to have originated from locally circulating DS-1-like G2P[4] human rotaviruses. Thus, the 2014 strains were assumed to be multiple reassortment strains as to DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant, bovine, bovine-like human, human, and/or locally circulating DS-1-like G2P[4] human rotaviruses. Overall, the great genomic diversity among the DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant strains seemed to have been generated through additional reassortment events involving animal and human strains. Moreover, all the 11 genes of three of the 2014 strains, NP-130, PCB-656, and SSL-55, were very closely related to those of Vietnamese DS-1-like G8P[8] strains that emerged in 2014-2015, indicating the derivation of these DS-1-like G8P[8] strains from a common ancestor. To our knowledge, this is the first report on full genome-based characterization of DS-1-like G8P[8] strains that have emerged in Thailand. Our observations will add to our growing understanding of the evolutionary patterns of emerging DS-1-like intergenogroup reassortant strains."
https://openalex.org/W2547253629,"Individuals with tetraplegia lack independent mobility, making them highly dependent on others to move from one place to another. Here, we describe how two macaques were able to use a wireless integrated system to control a robotic platform, over which they were sitting, to achieve independent mobility using the neuronal activity in their motor cortices. The activity of populations of single neurons was recorded using multiple electrode arrays implanted in the arm region of primary motor cortex, and decoded to achieve brain control of the platform. We found that free-running brain control of the platform (which was not equipped with any machine intelligence) was fast and accurate, resembling the performance achieved using joystick control. The decoding algorithms can be trained in the absence of joystick movements, as would be required for use by tetraplegic individuals, demonstrating that the non-human primate model is a good pre-clinical model for developing such a cortically-controlled movement prosthetic. Interestingly, we found that the response properties of some neurons differed greatly depending on the mode of control (joystick or brain control), suggesting different roles for these neurons in encoding movement intention and movement execution. These results demonstrate that independent mobility can be achieved without first training on prescribed motor movements, opening the door for the implementation of this technology in persons with tetraplegia."
https://openalex.org/W2547971536,"In recent years researchers have investigated a growing number of weighted heterogeneous networks, where connections are not merely binary entities, but are proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements. Different degree centrality measures have been proposed for this kind of networks. In this work we propose weighted degree and strength centrality measures (WDC and WSC). Using a reducing factor we correct classical centrality measures (CD) to account for tie weights distribution. The bigger the departure from equal weights distribution, the greater the reduction. These measures are applied to a real network of Italian livestock movements as an example. A simulation model has been developed to predict disease spread into Italian regions according to animal movements and animal population density. Model’s results, expressed as infected regions and number of times a region gets infected, were related to weighted and classical degree centrality measures. WDC and WSC were shown to be more efficient in predicting node’s risk and vulnerability. The proposed measures and their application in an animal network could be used to support surveillance and infection control strategy plans."
https://openalex.org/W2546961906,"Recent work has demonstrated pro-oncogenic functions of the transcription factor CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) in various tumors, implicating C/EBPβ as an interesting target for the development of small-molecule inhibitors. We have previously discovered that the sesquiterpene lactone helenalin acetate, a natural compound known to inhibit NF-κB, is a potent C/EBPβ inhibitor. We have now examined the inhibitory mechanism of helenalin acetate in more detail. We demonstrate that helenalin acetate is a significantly more potent inhibitor of C/EBPβ than of NF-κB. Our work shows that helenalin acetate inhibits C/EBPβ by binding to the N-terminal part of C/EBPβ, thereby disrupting the cooperation of C/EBPβ with the co-activator p300. C/EBPβ is expressed in several isoforms from alternative translational start codons. We have previously demonstrated that helenalin acetate selectively inhibits only the full-length (liver-enriched activating protein* (LAP*)) isoform but not the slightly shorter (LAP) isoform. Consistent with this, helenalin acetate binds to the LAP* but not to the LAP isoform, explaining why its inhibitory activity is selective for LAP*. Although helenalin acetate contains reactive groups that are able to interact covalently with cysteine residues, as exemplified by its effect on NF-κB, the inhibition of C/EBPβ by helenalin acetate is not due to irreversible reaction with cysteine residues of C/EBPβ. In summary, helenalin acetate is the first highly active small-molecule C/EBPβ inhibitor that inhibits C/EBPβ by a direct binding mechanism. Its selectivity for the LAP* isoform also makes helenalin acetate an interesting tool to dissect the functions of the LAP* and LAP isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2548026966,"The mosquito-borne disease avian malaria (Plasmodium spp.) has impacted both captive populations and wild individuals of native New Zealand bird species. However, whether or not it is a cause of concern to their wild populations is still unclear. In Hawaii, the disease has been a major factor in the population declines of some native forest bird species, often limiting their elevational distribution due to an inverse relationship between force of infection and elevation. While studies have investigated latitudinal patterns of infection in New Zealand, elevational patterns are unexplored. To address this, a survey was conducted in Nelson Lakes National Park, a site experiencing native bird declines in which disease has been suggested as playing a role, to investigate whether there is a similar inverse relationship in New Zealand. Results from blood samples (n = 436) collected over three seasons across a broad elevational range (650-1400 m) support there being such a relationship. In addition, an overall higher prevalence in non-native (14.1%) versus native birds (1.7%) may indicate differential impacts on these two groups, while particularly high prevalence in non-native Turdus spp. supports previous suggestions that they are key reservoir hosts for the disease. Overall, these findings add weight to the hypothesis that avian malaria is playing a role in ongoing declines of native New Zealand birds."
https://openalex.org/W2547131977,"Plant hydro-actuated systems provide a rich source of inspiration for designing autonomously morphing devices. One such example, the pentagonal ice plant seed capsule, achieves complex mechanical actuation which is critically dependent on its hierarchical organization. The functional core of this actuation system involves the controlled expansion of a highly swellable cellulosic layer, which is surrounded by a non-swellable honeycomb framework. In this work, we extract the design principles behind the unfolding of the ice plant seed capsules, and use two different approaches to develop autonomously deforming honeycomb devices as a proof of concept. By combining swelling experiments with analytical and finite element modelling, we elucidate the role of each design parameter on the actuation of the prototypes. Through these approaches, we demonstrate potential pathways to design/develop/construct autonomously morphing systems by tailoring and amplifying the initial material’s response to external stimuli through simple geometric design of the system at two different length scales."
https://openalex.org/W2547133881,"Abstract Flagellated bacteria modulate their swimming behavior in response to environmental cues through the CheA/CheY signaling pathway. In addition to responding to external chemicals, bacteria also monitor internal conditions that reflect the availability of oxygen, light, and reducing equivalents, in a process termed taxis. In Escherichia coli, the transmembrane receptor Aer is the primary energy sensor for motility. Genetic and physiological data suggest that Aer monitors the electron transport chain through the redox state of its FAD cofactor. However, direct biochemical data correlating FAD redox chemistry with CheA kinase activity have been lacking. Here, we test this hypothesis via functional reconstitution of Aer into nanodiscs. As purified, Aer contains fully oxidized FAD, which can be chemically reduced to the anionic semiquinone (ASQ). Oxidized Aer activates CheA, whereas ASQ Aer reversibly inhibits CheA. Under these conditions, Aer cannot be further reduced to the hydroquinone, in contrast to the proposed Aer signaling model. Pulse ESR spectroscopy of the ASQ corroborates a potential mechanism for signaling in that the resulting distance between the two flavin-binding PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domains implies that they tightly sandwich the signal-transducing HAMP domain in the kinase-off state. Aer appears to follow oligomerization patterns observed for related chemoreceptors, as higher loading of Aer dimers into nanodiscs increases kinase activity. These results provide a new methodological platform to study Aer function along with new mechanistic details into its signal transduction process."
https://openalex.org/W2548478904,"Abstract Prion diseases are devastating neurodegenerative disorders with no known cure. One strategy for developing therapies for these diseases is to identify compounds that block conversion of the cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC) into the infectious isoform (PrPSc). Most previous efforts to discover such molecules by high-throughput screening methods have utilized, as a read-out, a single kind of cellular assay system: neuroblastoma cells that are persistently infected with scrapie prions. Here, we describe the use of an alternative cellular assay based on suppressing the spontaneous cytotoxicity of a mutant form of PrP (Δ105-125). Using this assay, we screened 75,000 compounds, and identified a group of phenethyl piperidines (exemplified by LD7), that reduces the accumulation of PrPSc in infected neuroblastoma cells by >90% at low micromolar doses, and inhibits PrPSc-induced synaptotoxicity in hippocampal neurons. By analyzing the structure-activity relationships of 35 chemical derivatives, we defined the pharmacophore of LD7, and identified a more potent derivative. Active compounds do not alter total or cell-surface levels of PrPC, and do not bind to recombinant PrP in surface plasmon resonance experiments, although at high concentrations they inhibit PrPSc-seeded conversion of recombinant PrP to a misfolded state in an in vitro reaction (RT-QuIC). This class of small molecule may provide valuable therapeutic leads, as well as chemical biological tools to identify cellular pathways underlying PrPSc metabolism and PrPC function."

A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 2-1-1 callers (n = 500) assigned to control or intervention conditions. 2-1-1 information and referral specialists collected baseline data and delivered the intervention consisting of 3 mailings and 1 coaching call; university-based data collectors conducted follow-up interviews at 3 and 6 months post-baseline. Data were collected from June 2013 through July 2014. Participants were mostly female (87.2%), African American (61.4%), and smokers (76.6%). Participants assigned to the intervention condition were more likely than controls to report a full ban on smoking in the home at both 3- (38.1% vs 19.3%, p = < .001) and 6-month follow-up (43.2% vs 33.2%, p = .02). The longitudinal intent-to-treat analysis showed a significant intervention effect over time (OR = 1.31, p = .001), i.e. OR = 1.72 at 6 months. This study replicates prior findings showing the effectiveness of the minimal intervention to promote smoke-free homes in low-income households, and extends those findings by demonstrating they can be achieved when 2-1-1 information and referral specialists deliver the intervention. Findings offer support for this intervention as a generalizable and scalable model for reducing secondhand smoke exposure in homes."

Median overall survival (mOS) in the cohort was 32months. At the time of analysis deaths were recorded in 47 cases (62.7%). In patients who had Cm below the level of 0.743 risk of OS shortening was significantly higher than in other patients (12.1 and 43.4 months respectively; HR = 8.47, 95%CI: 2.91-24.66; χ2 = 15.38, p = 0.0001).Cm is a strong, independent prognostic factor in head and neck cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2546501407,"Heterochronic development has been proposed to have played an important role in the evolution of echinoderms. In the class Ophiuroidea, paedomorphosis (retention of juvenile characters into adulthood) has been documented in the families Ophiuridae and Ophiolepididae but not been investigated on a broader taxonomic scale. Historical errors, confusing juvenile stages with paedomorphic species, show the difficulties in correctly identifying the effects of heterochrony on development and evolution. This study presents a detailed analysis of 40 species with morphologies showing various degrees of juvenile appearance in late ontogeny. They are compared to a range of early ontogenetic stages from paedomorphic and non-paedomorphic species. Both quantitative and qualitative measurements are taken and analysed. The results suggest that strongly paedomorphic species are usually larger than other species at comparable developmental stage. The findings support recent notions of polyphyletic origin of the families Ophiuridae and Ophiolepididae. The importance of paedomorphosis and its correct recognition for the practice of taxonomy and phylogeny are emphasized."
https://openalex.org/W2546947078,"It has long been known that pathogenic Leptospira can mobilize the immune system but the specific contribution of neutrophils to control the infectious challenge remains to be clarified. We herein analyzed the phenotype of circulating neutrophils of patients with leptospirosis and healthy controls for the expression of toll-like receptor (TLR) type 2 (TLR2, to sense the leptospiral LPS) and several activation markers: interleukin 8 chemokine receptor CD182 (CXCR2), CD11b of the integrin/opsonin complement receptor type 3 (CR3) and CD15 (ligand of the selectin). The plasmatic level of the main CD182 ligand, interleukin 8 (CXCL8), was measured by ELISA. Hospitalized leptospirosis cases showed marked neutrophilia, particularly in the most severe cases. Interestingly, TLR2 was significantly increased in leptospirosis but identical levels of CD182 and CD11b were detected when compared to controls. CD15 was significantly decreased on neutrophils in leptospirosis but returned to normal within 1 month. Basal levels of IL-8 were measured in control subjects and were not increased in leptospirosis cases at the initial stage of the disease. In conclusion, we observed that neutrophils failed to regulate the expression of several of the receptors involved in cell activation and recruitment. This study further emphasizes the paradigm that neutrophils may be impaired in their overall capacity to thwart bacterial infection in leptospirosis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2547156427,"Deforestation and forest degradation are complex and dynamic processes that vary from place to place. They are driven by multiple causes. Local communities are, to some extent, driving and also affected by some of these processes. Can their knowledge aid and add to place-specific assessment and monitoring of Deforestation and forest Degradation (DD) drivers? Our research was conducted in seven villages across three provinces of Indonesia (Papua, West Kalimantan and Central Java). Household surveys and focus group discussions were used to investigate how local community knowledge of DD drivers contributes to place-specific assessment and monitoring of DD drivers. We analyzed the link between drivers and local livelihoods to see how attempts to address deforestation and forest degradation might affect local communities and how this link might influence their participation in climate change mitigation measures such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and Measuring, Reporting and Verifying (MRV) activities. We found that local knowledge is fundamental to capturing the variety of drivers particularly in countries like Indonesia where forest and socio-economic conditions are diverse. Better understanding of drivers and their importance for local livelihoods will not only contribute to a more locally appropriate design of REDD+ and monitoring systems but will also foster local participation."

Although histone acetyltransferases (HATs) have been well characterized both structurally and mechanistically, far less is known about non-histone acetyltransferase enzymes. The human ESCO1 and ESCO2 paralogs acetylate the cohesin complex subunit SMC3 to regulate the separation of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis. Missense mutations within the acetyltransferase domain of these proteins correlate with diseases, including endometrial cancers and Roberts syndrome. Despite their biological importance, the mechanisms underlying acetylation by the ESCO proteins are not understood. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of the highly conserved zinc finger-acetyltransferase moiety of ESCO1 with accompanying structure-based mutagenesis and biochemical characterization. We find that the ESCO1 acetyltransferase core is structurally homologous to the Gcn5 HAT, but contains unique additional features including a zinc finger and an ∼40-residue loop region that appear to play roles in protein stability and SMC3 substrate binding. We identify key residues that play roles in substrate binding and catalysis, and rationalize the functional consequences of disease-associated mutations.

In the case of SMC3, acetylation is performed by the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion acetyltransferases (ESCO1 and ESCO2 in human and Eco1 in yeast). The predicted catalytic cores of these enzymes share sequence homology with the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family of proteins (17.Neuwald A.F. Landsman D.

Together with biochemical and enzymatic studies, this structure reveals unique ESCO1 features that confer SMC3-specific acetylation and generates insight into the pathogenic nature of biologically relevant somatic mutations. To obtain a soluble ESCO/Eco1 construct suitable for crystallization trials, we performed recombinant expression trials in Escherichia coli using yeast and human homologs of the enzyme and a variety of constructs thereof. Although the majority of these proteins were poorly expressed, we found that a human ESCO1 construct consisting of the predicted GNAT acetyltransferase domain as well as the invariant N-terminal C2H2 zinc finger was soluble and monomeric (as judged by gel filtration chromatography), and therefore a good candidate for crystallization (Fig. 1, A and B). We were able to obtain crystals of this construct (human ESCO1 residues 599–825) bound to cofactor acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) that formed in space group I41 and diffracted to a resolution limit of 2.70 Å. Initial molecular replacement trials were performed using other GNAT proteins as model solutions, but were unable to provide adequate structure solutions. We collected a highly redundant dataset at the zinc peak to take advantage of the natively bound zinc ion and were able to obtain experimental phases using the single wavelength anomalous diffraction method. The structure was subsequently refined to an Rwork of 0.248 and an Rfree of 0.291 and shows one ESCO1 molecule per asymmetric unit (Table 1).TABLE 1Crystallographic statistics for ESCO1ESCO1·Ac-CoA crystalZn2+ phasing crystalData collectionBeamlineBNL X25BNL X25Wavelength, Å1.2811.281Crystal parametersSpace groupI41I41Cell lengths, Å115.6, 115.6, 61.1115.6, 115.6, 61.1Resolution, Å40.85–2.70 (2.75–2.70)50.00–2.76 (2.87–2.76)Unique reflections11,046 (485)10,976 (987)Total observations334,558 (10,185)329,280 (20,924)Completeness,aCompleteness values for data collection generated by Scalepack (47). %98.2 (86.8)98.2 (88.7)Redundancy30.3 (21.0)30.0 (21.2)Rsym0.061 (0.624)0.062 (0.599)〈I/σI〉73.3 (2.4)71.7 (2.7)RefinementRwork/Rfree0.250/0.285No. of atoms: totalProtein1370Ligand51Water14Ion1Average B-factors, Å295.0Protein95.0Ligand97.0Water94.0Ion102.6Ramachandran statistics, %Favored96.6Allowed3.4Outlier0.0RMS deviationsBonds, Å0.007Angles, °0.996MolProbityClash scorebValues in parentheses are percentile ranks from MolProbity server (48).17.34 (87%)Overall scorebValues in parentheses are percentile ranks from MolProbity server (48).2.05 (97%)PDB: 5T53a Completeness values for data collection generated by Scalepack (47.Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab The ESCO1 structure reveals a catalytic core containing the characteristic α/β motif (β3, β4, β7, α3, and α4) that is common among GNAT proteins (classically designated as motifs A, B, and D) such as Gcn5 (Fig. 1B). An additional conserved feature is the cofactor binding cleft where Ac-CoA is wedged in a groove comprising the β-strands (β7 and β8) and α-helices (α3 and α4) of the GNAT core (Fig. 1, C and D). The N-terminal zinc finger consists of a hairpin loop followed by an α-helix (α1), which fold around the zinc ion, which is ligated by amino acid ligands Cys-619, Cys-622, His-637, and His-641 (Figs. 1B and 2A). Although the zinc finger is tethered to the GNAT region through a loop and β-strand (β1), this region also forms an extensive hydrophobic interface with the α2 helix and β7 strand of the GNAT core. In particular, Phe-640 and Phe-644 of the α1 helix make van der Waals contacts to Met-688, Trp-773, and Phe-775 of the GNAT core, and Gln-643 of the α1 helix makes a hydrogen bond to Asn-691 of the GNAT core (Fig. 2A) (28.Vetting M.W. S. de Carvalho L.P. Yu M. Hegde S.S. Magnet S. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Structure and functions of the GNAT superfamily of acetyltransferases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Another striking structural feature unique to ESCO1 is an extended “loop insert” (residues 727–766) between the β4 and β7 strands that extends away from the core and contains two short antiparallel β-strands (β5 and β6) that form a hairpin (Fig. 1C). Notably, the segment of the loop connecting these strands (residues 740–753) could not be traced in the electron density map and is presumably disordered. A structural alignment of ESCO1·Ac-CoA with the Gcn5·Ac-CoA·histone H3 peptide ternary complex structure reveals that although the core folds superimpose well (Cα RMSD = 3.60 Å), the structural features of Gcn5 that mediate interaction with the H3 substrate peptide (Gcn5 α1 helix and α5-β5 loop) are not conserved in ESCO1 (Fig. 1E). Notably, the aforementioned β5-β6 hairpin from the β4-β7 loop insert of ESCO1 appears to replace one of the substrate peptide binding loops of Gcn5. Variability within this peptide binding cleft is common among GNAT proteins and has previously been shown to be a common mechanism for achieving substrate specificity (29.Friedmann D.R. Marmorstein R. Structure and mechanism of non-histone protein acetyltransferase enzymes.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 5570-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30.Marmorstein R. Zhou M.M. Writers and readers of histone acetylation: structure, mechanism, and inhibition.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2014; 6: a018762Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that these regions are responsible for cohesin substrate recognition by ESCO1 (Fig. 1E). The packing of the ESCO1 zinc finger against the GNAT core suggests that it may play a role in the stability of the acetyltransferase domain. To test the functional importance of this interaction, three mutants were prepared (F640A, Q643A, and F644A) that we predicted would disrupt the interface based on structural analysis. For these and subsequent functional studies, we employed a larger ESCO1 construct (residues 590–840) than used for crystal structure determination (residues 599–825), which we found to be more stable and active than the construct used for crystallization and X-ray structure determination. We first tested the stability of these proteins using a thermal denaturation assay, which showed that the melting temperature of the wild-type protein (50 °C) was indeed reduced by each these mutations (41, 47, and 36 °C, respectively) (Fig. 2B). Next, we sought to determine the effect of these mutations on catalysis by using a radioactive acetyltransferase assay that monitors transfer of a 14C-labeled acetyl group from Ac-CoA to an SMC3 peptide (residues 97–117). The results from our enzymatic analysis demonstrated that these mutants have severely compromised activity, with F640A, Q643A, and F644A all showing an ∼6-fold decrease in activity at 1 μm protein concentration (Fig. 2C). Together, these findings demonstrate that the zinc finger plays a direct role in ESCO acetyltransferase domain stabilization and an indirect role in positioning of the accompanying active site residues. We next questioned whether the ESCO-specific hairpin within the β4-β7 loop insert region plays a role in protein function. Interestingly, although this loop is of variable length among ESCO1 homologs, there are several residues that appear to be moderately conserved and therefore may be important for substrate binding and/or catalysis (Fig. 1B). To test this possibility, we implemented the thermal denaturation and catalytic assay on a set of loop mutants to assess their effect on protein stability and activity. We identified three conserved residues in this region (Arg-732, Glu-735, and Glu-736) (Fig. 1B) that are required for optimal protein stability and activity (Fig. 2, B and C). Because this loop is located near the predicted peptide binding cleft, we propose that the mutations cause deficiencies in SMC3 substrate recognition. In either case, ESCO1 provides yet another example of how GNATs exploit distinct structural domains to regulate substrate-specific catalysis. We were also prompted to investigate the oligomeric state of ESCO1 by the observation of a symmetrical dimer in the crystal lattice (Fig. 2D). Specifically, the β5-β6 hairpins from the β4-β7 loop inserts wrap around one another and form an antiparallel β-sheet. This interaction also appears to be supplemented by contacts between residues within these loops (Glu-736 and Trp-756) and the putative cohesion substrate binding site of the adjacent subunit (Fig. 2D). Further analysis of the crystal lattice using the PDBePISA server is also consistent with a dimer, showing that the most stable assembly is a dimer with a buried surface area of 5,300 Å2 and a ΔG of dissociation of 23.9 kcal/mol. To test the potential biological relevance of the crystallographic dimer, we subjected ESCO1 to sedimentation equilibrium analysis in the absence or presence of Ac-CoA. Both of these samples showed a single sedimenting species with calculated molecular masses of 36,700 (with Ac-CoA) and 33,692 (without Ac-CoA), as compared with the theoretical molecular weight of 31,753 (28,950 protein + 2,083 tobacco etch virus (TEV) sequence and His6 tag). We also analyzed the WT enzyme with CoA and the SMC3 peptide and found its sedimentation to also be consistent with a single species corresponding to a size close to that of a monomer 38,401 (theoretical molecular weight protein, CoA and peptide = 34,858) (Figs. 2E and 3). These results are consistent with the initial gel filtration analysis (data not shown), which together suggest that ESCO1 exists predominantly as a monomer in solution. Because GNAT proteins have been shown to exploit a variety of residue identities and locations to achieve lysine deprotonation, it is difficult to determine which amino acids in ESCO1 are important for catalysis from protein sequence alignments alone (29.Friedmann D.R. Marmorstein R. Structure and mechanism of non-histone protein acetyltransferase enzymes.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 5570-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30.Marmorstein R. Zhou M.M. Writers and readers of histone acetylation: structure, mechanism, and inhibition.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2014; 6: a018762Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used structure-guided analysis of the active site to identify several residues that are positioned to potentially play catalytic roles. We specifically focused on Asp-690, Glu-725, Ser-770, Arg-771, Ser-809, and Asp-810, all of which have the potential to be involved in the proton transfer step of the acetylation mechanism (Fig. 4C) based on their location relative to Ac-CoA. To probe the catalytic contributions made by each of these residues, we prepared a series of point mutants and analyzed their effect on protein stability and catalytic activity. Although protein stability varied depending on the mutation site, each of the mutants appeared to be properly folded based on their gel filtration elution profiles. Although the steady state catalytic parameters could be determined for the wild-type enzyme (kcat = 0.34 ± 0. 03 min−1, Km, Ac-CoA = 77 ± 14 μm, Km, SMC3 peptide = 53 ± 8 μm), we could not calculate these values for the mutants due to assay detection limits. Therefore, the activity levels were represented as the concentration of product present at the end of each reaction. Surprisingly, all mutations showed low levels of activity (2–9-fold decreases relative to WT), including E725Q, which had no measurable effect on protein stability (Fig. 2, B and C). We next sought to tease out the function of these residues in catalysis, which could be related to substrate binding, lysine deprotonation, or both. Two residues that are particularly well positioned to function as general base residues are Glu-725 and Asp-810. To elucidate the role of these amino acids in catalysis, we calculated the activity of corresponding point mutants at different pH values ranging from 5.5 to 11.0 (Fig. 4, D and E). These assays show that although the E725Q mutant is inactive at all pH values tested, activity for the D810N mutant can be rescued (albeit to a lower degree than WT) as pH values that approach 10, where lysine deprotonation can occur spontaneously. This is strong evidence that Asp-810 contributes to general base catalysis. The possibility that other residues such as Asp-690, Ser-770, Ser-809, and particularly Glu-725, also contribute to lysine deprotonation cannot be ruled out. We also note that Arg-771 is in a position to act as a general acid in the catalytic mechanism. Additionally, these residues could be involved in substrate peptide recognition. To gain further insight into substrate peptide binding, we analyzed a superposition of the ESCO1·Ac-CoA complex with the ternary Gcn5·CoA·histone H3 peptide complex. We then used this alignment to generate a model for how a substrate peptide might engage ESCO1 (Fig. 5, A and B). When docked onto a surface representation of ESCO1, the substrate lysine (H3K14) extends into a narrow"

Given the fluctuating nature of depression and its profound impacts on clinical and quality-of-life outcomes, this study aimed to examine the prevalence, recurrence and incidence of current depressive symptoms and its underlying catalysts longitudinally and systematically among these individuals. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study between October 1, 2007 and December 31, 2012 using longitudinal linked data sources. Current depressive symptoms was identified using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale or the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, first at baseline and again during follow-up interviews. Multivariable regressions were used to characterize the three outcomes. Results Of the 3,816 HIV-positive participants, the point prevalence of depressive symptoms was estimated at 28%. Of the 957 participants who were identified with depressive symptoms at baseline and who had at least two years of follow-up, 43% had a recurrent episode. The cumulative incidence among 1,745 previously depressive symptoms free participants (at or prior to baseline) was 14%. During the five-year follow-up, our multivariable models showed that participants with greater risk of recurrent cases were more likely to feel worried about their housing situation. Participants at risk of developing incident cases were also likely to be younger, gay or bisexual, and unable to afford housing-related expenses. Conclusions Depressive symptoms are prevalent and likely to recur among people living with HIV. Our results support the direction of Ontario’s HIV/AIDS Strategy to 2026, which addresses medical concerns associated with HIV (such as depression) and the social drivers of health in order to enhance the overall well-being of people living with or at risk of HIV. Our findings reinforce the importance of providing effective mental health care and demonstrate the need for long-term support and routine management of depression, particularly for individuals at high risk."
https://openalex.org/W2548890314,"Anti-bone resorptive drugs such as bisphosphonates, the anti-RANKL antibody (denosumab), or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been developed to treat osteoporosis. Mechanisms underlying activity of bisphosphonates or denosumab in this context are understood, while it is less clear how SERMs like tamoxifen, raloxifene, or bazedoxifene inhibit bone resorption. Recently, accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif1α) in osteoclasts was shown to be suppressed by estrogen in normal cells. In addition, osteoclast activation and decreased bone mass seen in estrogen-deficient conditions was found to require Hif1α. Here, we used western blot analysis of cultured osteoclast precursor cells to show that tamoxifen, raloxifene, or bazedoxifene all suppress Hif1α protein accumulation. The effects of each SERM on osteoclast differentiation differed in vitro. Our results suggest that interventions such as the SERMs evaluated here could be useful to inhibit Hif1α and osteoclast activity under estrogen-deficient conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2547305273,"Aleutian disease (AD) is a common immunosuppressive disease in mink farms world-wide. Since the 1980s, counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) has been the main detection method for infection with the Aleutian Mink Disease Virus (AMDV). In this study, six peptides derived from the AMDV structural protein VP2 were designed, synthesized, and used as ELISA antigens to detect anti-AMDV antibodies in the sera of infected minks. Serum samples were collected from 764 minks in farms from five different provinces, and analyzed by both CIEP (a gold standard) and peptide ELISA. A peptide designated P1 (415 aa–433 aa) exhibited good antigenicity. A novel ELISA was developed using ovalbumin-linked peptide P1 to detect anti-AMDV antibodies in mink sera. The sensitivity and specificity of the peptide ELISA was 98.0% and 97.5%, respectively. Moreover, the ELISA also detected 342 early-stage infected samples (negative by CIEP and positive by PCR), of which 43.6% (149/342) were true positives. These results showed that the peptide ELISA had better sensitivity compared with CIEP, and therefore could be preferable over CIEP for detecting anti-AMDV antibodies in serological screening."
https://openalex.org/W2547905121,"We previously reported a loss-of-PITX1 expression in patients suffering of knee/hip osteoarthritis (OA). Search for the mechanism underlying this event led us to discover that PITX1 repression was triggered by the aberrant nuclear accumulation of Prohibitin (PHB1), an E2F1 co-repressor, in OA articular chondrocytes. In the current study, we assessed in details the involvement of E2F transcription factors in regulating PITX1 expression. We also analyzed other genes that are similarly regulated by E2F in regard to osteoarthritis. The transcriptional regulation of the PITX1 promoter by E2F1 was analyzed with the luciferase reporter assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, which confirmed direct E2F1-PITX1 interactions. The probable binding sites for E2F1 in the PITX1 promoter were identified by DNA pulldown experiments. In silico and in vitro analyses show that the PITX1 proximal promoter region contains 2 specific sequences that are bound by E2F1. Overexpression of E2F1 enhances PITX1 promoter activity and mRNA transcription. In primary control and osteoarthritis chondrocytes, real time RT-PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of candidate genes under E2F1 transcriptional control. Transcription Factor Dp-1 (TFDP1) knockdown experiments confirmed that the E2F1-TFDP1 complex regulates PITX1. Knockdown of TFDP1, an E2F1 dimerization partner, inhibits the activating effect of E2F1 and reduces both PITX1 promoter activity and mRNA transcription. Real time RT-PCR results reveal reduced expression of TFDP1 and a similar downregulation of their targets PITX1, BRCA1, CDKN1A, and RAD51 in mid-stage OA chondrocytes. Collectively, our data define a previously uncharacterized role for E2F1 and TFDP1 in the transcriptional regulation of PITX1 in articular chondrocytes. Additional E2F1 targets may be affected in OA pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2548765406,"Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), an emerging multisystem disease, has the similar pathogenesis with diabetes and is prevalent in diabetes. This study investigated whether NAFLD is associated with retinopathy in individuals with diabetes and without diabetes. Methods The association between NAFLD and retinopathy was investigated in 5963 participants aged 40 years and older who participated in the NHANES III, a nationally representative, population-based and cross-sectional study. NAFLD was detected via ultrasonography, and fundus photographs were obtained to grade retinopathy patterns. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the presence of retinopathy and NAFLD and diabetes. Results After adjusting for multiple covariates, NAFLD population had no evidence of retinopathy increase in population without diabetes (odds ratio [OR]: 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48 to 1.26). In addition, NAFLD in individuals with diabetes was not significantly associated with retinopathy (OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.26), independent of age, gender, ethnicity, waist circumference, serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, serum triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, and glycated hemoglobin. Conclusions In the US general population, NAFLD is not a precipitating factor of retinopathy in population with or without diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2548857449,"Healthy subjects under rhythmic breathing have heart interbeat intervals with a respiratory band in the frequency domain that can be an index of vagal activity. Diabetes Mellitus Type II (DM) affects the autonomic nervous system of patients, thus it can be expected changes on the vagal activity. Here, the influence of DM on the breathing modulation of the heart rate is evaluated by analyzing in the frequency domain heart interbeat interval (IBI) records obtained from 30 recently diagnosed, 15 long standing DM patients, and 30 control subjects during standardized clinical tests of controlled breathing at 0.1 Hz, supine rest and standing upright. Fourier spectral analysis of IBI records quantifies heart rate variability in different regions: low-frequencies (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz), high-frequencies (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz), and a controlled breathing peak (RP, centered around 0.1 Hz). Two new parameters are introduced: the frequency radius rf (square root of the sum of LF and HF squared) and β (power of RP divided by the sum of LF and HF). As diabetes evolves, the controlled breathing peak loses power and shifts to smaller frequencies, indicating that heart rate modulation is slower in diabetic patients than in controls. In contrast to the traditional parameters LF, HF and LF/HF, which do not show significant differences between the three populations in neither of the clinical tests, the new parameters rf and β, distinguish between control and diabetic subjects in the case of controlled breathing. Sympathetic activity that is driven by the baroreceptor reflex associated with the 0.1 Hz breathing modulations is affected in DM patients. Diabetes produces not only a rigid heartbeat with less autonomic induced variability (rf diminishes), but also alters the coupling between breathing and heart rate (reduced β), due to a progressive decline of vagal and sympathetic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2546525002,"The production of large numbers of males needed for a sustainable sterile insect technique (SIT) control program requires significant developmental and operational costs. This may constitute a significant economic barrier to the installation of large scale rearing facilities in countries that are undergoing a transition from being largely dependent on insecticide use to be in a position to integrate the SIT against Aedes albopictus. Alternative options available for those countries could be to rely on outsourcing of sterile males from a foreign supplier, or for one centralised facility to produce mosquitoes for several countries, thus increasing the efficiency of the mass-rearing effort. However, demonstration of strain compatibility is a prerequisite for the export of mosquitoes for transborder SIT applications. Here, we compared mating compatibility among Ae. albopictus populations originating from three islands of the South Western Indian Ocean, and assessed both insemination rates and egg fertility in all possible cross-mating combinations. Furthermore, competitiveness between irradiated and non-irradiated males from the three studied strains, and the subsequent effect on female fertility were also examined. Although morphometric analysis of wing shapes suggested phenoptypic differences between Ae. albopictus strains, perfect reproductive compatibility between them was observed. Furthermore, irradiated males from the different islands demonstrated similar levels of competitiveness and induced sterility when confronted with fertile males from any of the other island populations tested. In conclusion, despite the evidence of inter-strain differences based on male wing morphology, collectively, our results provide a new set of expectations for the use of a single candidate strain of mass-reared sterile males for area-wide scale application of SIT against Ae. albopictus populations in different islands across the South Western Indian Ocean. Cross-mating competitiveness tests such as those applied here are necessary to assess the quality of mass reared strains for the trans-border application of sterile male release programs."
https://openalex.org/W2547648658,"Establishment of a proper balance of excitatory and inhibitory connectivity is achieved during development of cortical networks and adjusted through synaptic plasticity. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA3 regulate the perisomatic synapse density of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in the mouse frontal cortex through ephrin-A5-induced growth cone collapse. In this study, it was demonstrated that binding of NCAM and EphA3 occurred between the NCAM Ig2 domain and EphA3 cysteine-rich domain (CRD). The binding interface was further refined through molecular modeling and mutagenesis and shown to be comprised of complementary charged residues in the NCAM Ig2 domain (Arg-156 and Lys-162) and the EphA3 CRD (Glu-248 and Glu-264). Ephrin-A5 induced co-clustering of surface-bound NCAM and EphA3 in GABAergic cortical interneurons in culture. Receptor clustering was impaired by a charge reversal mutation that disrupted NCAM/EphA3 association, emphasizing the importance of the NCAM/EphA3 binding interface for cluster formation.

EphA3 kinase activation and signaling depend on receptor clustering and are important for growth cone collapse, axon repulsion, and synaptic plasticity (29.Lisabeth E.M. Falivelli G. Pasquale E.B. Eph receptor signaling and ephrins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: 1-20Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of EphA receptors consists of a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), and two fibronectin III (FN) domains (30.Himanen J.P. Ectodomain structures of Eph receptors.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 23: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of ephrin-A5 or ephrin-A2 bound EphA2 demonstrated that ephrinA-EphA interactions are mediated by the LBD and an additional surface in the CRD, enabling formation of large multimeric receptor/ligand clusters. Studies of EphA4 clustering suggested that only the CRD interface is important for clustering of EphA4, rather than the additional LBD interface used by EphA2 (31.Seiradake E. Schaupp A. del Toro Ruiz D. Kaufmann R. Mitakidis N. Harlos K. Aricescu A.R. Klein R. Jones E.Y. Structurally encoded intraclass differences in EphA clusters drive distinct cell responses.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Together, these studies indicate that even Eph receptors in the same family can have varying clustering properties based on subtle differences in their ectodomains. The EphA3 structure has not been solved, but its overall sequence is more similar to EphA4 than EphA2. How NCAM engages EphA3 to promote repellent responses is unclear. NCAM has five Ig-class and two FN domains in its extracellular region and a cytoplasmic domain that differs in size among three principal isoforms (32.Soroka V. Kasper C. Poulsen F.M. Structural biology of NCAM.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2010; 663: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The NCAM extracellular region can be modified by polysialylation (PSA-NCAM), which is implicated in mediating synaptic plasticity (33.Rutishauser U. Polysialic acid in the plasticity of the developing and adult vertebrate nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). PSA-NCAM is highly expressed in the embryonic and early postnatal stages and in interneuron populations in the mature cortex (33.Rutishauser U.

The 140-kDa isoform NCAM140 interacts physically and functionally with EphA3 to a greater extent than other isoforms (2.Brennaman L.H. Zhang X. Guan H. Triplett J.W. Brown A. Demyanenko G.P.

Neurol. 1989; 288: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). NCAM forms trans and cis homodimers in the plasma membrane, and these interactions are mediated by the Ig1, Ig2, and Ig3 domains as well as the first FN domain (32.Soroka V. Kasper C. Poulsen F.M. Structural biology of NCAM.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2010; 663: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38.Soroka V. Kolkova K. Kastrup J.S. Diederichs K. Breed J. Kiselyov V.V. Poulsen F.M.

Based on the knowledge that NCAM and EphA3 colocalize at perisomatic synapses in vivo, interact biochemically, and promote remodeling of GABAergic interneuron terminals (2.Brennaman L.H. Zhang X. Guan H. Triplett J.W. Brown A. Demyanenko G.P. Manis P.B. Landmesser L. Maness P.F. Polysialylated NCAM and EphrinA/EphA regulate synaptic development of GABAergic interneurons in prefrontal cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2013; 23: 162-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that NCAM may promote EphA3 receptor clustering and signaling to bring about growth cone collapse and axon terminal retraction. In this study, we utilized an approach combining molecular modeling based on crystal structures of rat NCAM Ig1–3 (PDB code 1QZ1) and the LBD/CRD regions of human EphA4 (PDB code 4M4P), analysis of receptor clustering, and functional assays to define the molecular and cellular mechanism by which NCAM promotes EphA3 signaling required for growth cone collapse of GABAergic interneurons. It was demonstrated that NCAM binding to EphA3 promotes ephrin-A5-dependent receptor clustering to activate EphA3 kinase signaling, necessary for EphA3 autophosphorylation, RhoA-GTPase activation, and growth cone collapse of cortical GABAergic interneurons. Previous studies identified an interaction between NCAM and EphA3 in the mouse forebrain, and the interaction site on NCAM was mapped to the extracellular region (2.Brennaman L.H. Zhang X. Guan H. Triplett J.W. Brown A. Demyanenko G.P. Manis P.B. Landmesser L. Maness P.F. Polysialylated NCAM and EphrinA/EphA regulate synaptic development of GABAergic interneurons in prefrontal cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2013; 23: 162-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that NCAM may promote receptor clustering and signaling by binding EphA3 through association with specific extracellular domains. To identify the binding determinants on EphA3 and NCAM, pulldown experiments were performed using domain deletions of each molecule. HEK293T cells were transfected with WT EphA3, EphA3 lacking the LBD (EphA3ΔLBD), and EphA3 lacking both the LBD and CRD (EphA3ΔLBD/CRD) (39.Janes P.W. Griesshaber B. Atapattu L. Nievergall E. Hii L.L. Mensinga A. Chheang C. Day B.W. Boyd A.W. Bastiaens P.I. Jørgensen C. Pawson T. Lackmann M. Eph receptor function is modulated by heterooligomerization of A and B type Eph receptors.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 195: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transfected lysates were incubated with purified fusion proteins consisting of the entire extracellular region of NCAM, Ig1–5/FN1–2 with a C-terminal Fc tag (NCAM-EC). Protein A/G-Sepharose pulldown of NCAM-EC showed that the extracellular domain of NCAM bound WT EphA3 and EphA3ΔLBD, indicating that the ligand-binding domainof EphA3 was not required for interaction with NCAM. However, EphA3ΔLBD/CRD was unable to bind NCAM-EC (Fig. 1B), identifying the CRD as the critical binding domain. To delineate the EphA3 binding domain on NCAM, full-length NCAM-EC or NCAM truncations containing Ig1–3, Ig1–2, Ig2, or Ig1 as Fc fusion proteins were incubated with lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with WT EphA3. Fc pulldown assays showed that NCAM Ig1–3, Ig1–2, and the Ig2 domain alone bound EphA3, whereas NCAM Ig1 was not sufficient for binding (Fig. 1, C and D). These experiments demonstrated that the Ig2 domain of NCAM contains the required binding site for EphA3. To more finely map the interaction determinants at the amino acid level, molecular modeling was performed using the ClusPro server (40.Comeau S.R. Gatchell D.W. Vajda S. Camacho C.J. ClusPro: an automated docking and discrimination method for the prediction of protein complexes.Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) to analyze docking between rat NCAM Ig1–3 (PDB code 1QZ1) (38.Soroka V. Kolkova K. Kastrup J.S. Diederichs K. Breed J. Kiselyov V.V. Poulsen F.M. Larsen I.K. Welte W. Berezin V. Bock E. Kasper C.

Tzvetkova-Robev D. Xu Y. Goldgur Y. Chan Y.P. Himanen J.P. Nikolov D.B. Insights into Eph receptor tyrosine kinase activation from crystal structures of the EphA4 ectodomain and its complex with ephrin-A5.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 14634-14639Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Docking poses were screened for compatibility with interaction on the surface of a membrane in a cis conformation, lack of steric hindrance between additional domains of the molecules, and the number of hydrogen bonds within the interaction interface. Structural modeling suggested that NCAM and EphA3 bind through a charged interface involving basic residues in the NCAM Ig2 domain (Arg-156, Lys-162, and Arg-192) engaging acidic residues of the EphA3 CRD (Glu-246, Glu-248, and Glu-264) (Fig. 1A). To test this model, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate charge reversal mutants of NCAM and EphA3 at the predicted sites of interaction. The mutations NCAM R156E and K162D decreased binding to EphA3 to levels of 11% and 10% of the WT, respectively (Fig. 1, E and F; p < 0.05). Interestingly, these two basic residues were located in the heparin binding site of the Ig2 domain, KHKGRDVILKKDVRFI (42.Cole G.J. Akeson R. Identification of a heparin binding domain of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM using synthetic peptides.Neuron. 1989; 2: 1157-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The heparin binding sites are solvent-exposed in NCAM dimers, suggesting that NCAM may engage in homophilic and heterophilic binding concurrently. This motif is also important for binding to extracellular matrix proteoglycans (43.Kallapur S.G. Akeson R.A. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCMA) heparin binding domain binds to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans.J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). NCAM R192E exhibited diminished binding to EphA3, although the decrease did not reach significance (p = 0.065). Arg-192 is contained in the sequence GRILARGEINFK of the NCAM Ig2 domain that is required for binding to Ig1 necessary for NCAM-NCAM homodimerization (44.Soroka V. Kiryushko D. Novitskaya V. Ronn L.C. Poulsen F.M. Holm A. Bock E. Berezin V.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24676-24683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Charge reversal mutations in predicted interaction sites of EphA3 (E248R or E264K) significantly inhibited co-immunoprecipitation of EphA3 and NCAM (∼2% of the WT) (Fig. 1, G and H). Together, these mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that the Ig2 domain of NCAM and the CRD domain of EphA3 comprise a charged interface for interaction. EphA3 signaling depends on ligand-induced receptor clustering and is important for growth cone collapse, axon repulsion, and synaptic plasticity (45.Pasquale E.B. Eph receptor signalling casts a wide net on cell behaviour.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 46.Klein R. Kania A. Ephrin signalling in the developing nervous system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 27: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Studies of EphA family members demonstrated that EphA2 forms extended arrays through two distinct interfaces (47.Himanen J.P. Yermekbayeva L. Janes P.W. Walker J.R. Xu K. Atapattu L. Rajashankar K.R. Mensinga A. Lackmann M. Nikolov D.B. Dhe-Paganon S. Architecture of Eph receptor clusters.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 10860-10865Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) in the LBD and CRD, whereas EphA4 clusters are typically smaller and oligomeric because of their reliance on only one of these two corresponding interfaces, the CRD interface, suggesting that EphA receptors can have different clustering tendencies based on their ectodomains (31.Seiradake E. Schaupp A. del Toro Ruiz D. Kaufmann R. Mitakidis N. Harlos K. Aricescu A.R. Klein R. Jones E.Y. Structurally encoded intraclass differences in EphA clusters drive distinct cell responses.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the extent to which these clusters form in the absence of NCAM is not known. The importance of NCAM/EphA3 binding for receptor clustering was assessed in cortical neuron cultures from NCAM KO mice co-transfected with WT or mutant NCAM140 together with pCMV-IRES-eGFP (Fig. 2A). We focused on GABAergic (GABA-immunopositive) interneurons in these cultures based on the identified role of NCAM at interneuron perisomatic puncta. After treatment with preclustered Fc or ephrin-A5-Fc for 30 min, cells were immunostained for GABA, NCAM, and EphA3 and imaged confocally. GFP/GABA double-positive cells were selected in single optical sections, and colocalization of NCAM and EphA3 was assessed. GABA staining allowed the identification of individual axons to ensure that clustering was observed in single neurites and not bundles. The proportion of colocalized signal for each channel was evaluated by colocalization analysis yielding thresholded Manders coefficients (Fig, 2, B and C; tM1, proportion of red pixels colocalizing with green pixels; tM2, proportion of green pixels colocalizing with red pixels). As a further measure of correlation of the two fluorescent signals, Pearson correlation coefficients (R > 0 indicates positive correlation, R < 0 indi"

However, the details of how RNA viruses build such intracellular structures are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the structure and formation of the viral factories, called viral speckle of transcripts (vSPOTs), that are produced in the nuclei of host cells by Borna disease virus (BDV). Super-resolution microscopic analysis showed that BDV assembled vSPOTs as intranuclear cage-like structures with 59–180-nm pores. The viral nucleoprotein formed the exoskeletons of vSPOTs, whereas the other viral proteins appeared to be mainly localized within these structures. In addition, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy revealed that filamentous structures resembling viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) appeared to protrude from the outer surfaces of the vSPOTs. We also found that vSPOTs disintegrated into RNPs concurrently with the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis. These observations demonstrated that BDV generates viral replication factories whose shape and formation are regulated, suggesting the mechanism of the integrity of RNA virus persistent infection in the nucleus."

This study aimed to describe the system and report CVD incidence, mortality and case-fatality between urban and rural areas in Zhejiang in 2012. The surveillance system employs a stratified random sampling method covering all permanent residents of 30 counties/districts in Zhejiang. Acute CVD events such as coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke were defined, registered and reviewed based on the adapted MONICA (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease) definitions. Data were collected from health facilities, vital registries, supplementary surveys, and additional investigations, and were checked for data quality before input in the system. We calculated the rates and compared them by gender, age and region. In 2012, the incidence, mortality and case-fatality of total acute CVD events were 367.0 (CHD 59.1, stroke 307.9), 127.1 (CHD 43.3, stroke 83.8) per 100,000 and 34.6% (CHD 73.2%, stroke 27.2%), respectively. Compared with rural areas, urban areas reported higher incidence and mortality but lower case-fatality rates for CHD (P<0.001), while lower incidence but higher mortality and case-fatality rates for stroke (P<0.001). We found significant differences on CHD and stroke epidemics between urban and rural areas in Zhejiang. Special attentions need to be given to stroke control, especially in rural areas."

Talin is a large 235-kDa protein composed of an N-terminal 45-kDa FERM (4.1, ezrin-, radixin-, and moesin-related protein) domain, also known as the talin head domain, and a series of helical bundles known as the rod domain. The talin head domain consists of four distinct lobes designated as F0–F3. Integrin binding and activation are mediated through the F3 region, a critically regulated domain in talin. Regulation of the F3 lobe is accomplished through autoinhibition via anti-parallel dimerization. In the anti-parallel dimerization model, the rod domain region of one talin molecule binds to the F3 lobe on an adjacent talin molecule, thus achieving the state of autoinhibition. Platelet functionality requires integrin activation for adherence and thrombus formation, and thus regulation of talin presents a critical node where pharmacological intervention is possible. A major mechanism of integrin activation in platelets is through heterotrimeric G protein signaling regulating hemostasis and thrombosis. Here, we provide evidence that switch region 2 (SR2) of the ubiquitously expressed G protein (Gα13) directly interacts with talin, relieves its state of autoinhibition, and triggers integrin activation. Biochemical analysis of Gα13 shows SR2 binds directly to the F3 lobe of talin's head domain and competes with the rod domain for binding. Intramolecular FRET analysis shows Gα13 can relieve autoinhibition in a cellular milieu. Finally, a myristoylated SR2 peptide shows demonstrable decrease in thrombosis in vivo.

In this study, we examined the association between RET/PTC rearrangements and thyroid hormone homeostasis, and explored whether concomitant diseases such as nodular goiter and Hashimoto's thyroiditis influenced this association. A total of 114 patients diagnosed with PTC were enrolled in this study. Thyroid hormone levels, clinicopathological parameters and lifestyle were obtained through medical records and surgical pathology reports. RET/PTC rearrangements were detected using TaqMan RT-PCR and validated by direct sequencing. No RET/PTC rearrangements were detected in benign thyroid tissues. RET/PTC rearrangements were detected in 23.68% (27/114) of PTC tissues. No association between thyroid function, clinicopathological parameters and lifestyle was observed either in total thyroid cancer patients or the subgroup of patients with concomitant disease. In the subgroup of PTC patients without concomitant disease, RET/PTC rearrangement was associated with multifocal cancer (P = 0.018). RET/PTC rearrangement was also correlated with higher TSH levels at one month post-surgery (P = 0.037). Based on likelihood-ratio regression analysis, the RET/PTC-positive PTC cases showed an increased risk of multifocal cancers in the thyroid gland (OR = 5.57, 95% CI, 1.39–22.33). Our findings suggest that concomitant diseases such as nodular goiter and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in PTC may be a confounding factor when examining the effects of RET/PTC rearrangements. Excluding the potential effect of this confounding factor showed that RET/PTC may confer an increased risk for the development of multifocal cancers in the thyroid gland. Aberrantly increased post-operative levels of TSH were also associated with RET/PTC rearrangement. Together, our data provides useful information for the treatment of papillary thyroid cancer."

However, the clinical relevance of Ang-1 as a biomarker in PH remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the prognostic and clinical significance of Ang-1 in PH using data from the prospectively recruiting Giessen PH Registry. Methods Patients with suspected PH (without previous specific pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH] therapy) who underwent initial right heart catheterization (RHC) in our national referral center between July 2003 and May 2012 and who agreed to optional biomarker analysis were included if they were diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, connective tissue disease-associated PAH (CTD-PAH), PH due to left heart disease (PH-LHD), or chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH), or if PH was excluded by RHC (non-PH controls). The association of Ang-1 levels with disease severity (6-minute walk distance and pulmonary hemodynamics) was assessed using linear regression, and the impact of Ang-1 levels on transplant-free survival (primary endpoint) and clinical worsening was assessed using Kaplan—Meier curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, and Cox regression. Results 151 patients (39, 39, 32, and 41 with idiopathic PAH, CTD-PAH, PH-LHD, and CTEPH, respectively) and 41 non-PH controls were included. Ang-1 levels showed no significant difference between groups (p = 0.8), and no significant associations with disease severity in PH subgroups (p ≥ 0.07). In Kaplan—Meier analyses, Ang-1 levels (stratified by quartile) had no significant impact on transplant-free survival (p ≥ 0.27) or clinical worsening (p ≥ 0.51) in PH subgroups. Regression models found no significant association between Ang-1 levels and outcomes (p ≥ 0.31). ROC analyses found no significant cut-off that would maximize sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions Despite a strong pathophysiological association in experimental studies, this first comprehensive analysis of Ang-1 in PH subgroups suggests that Ang-1 is not a predictive and clinically relevant biomarker in PH."

Multiple gradient echo images covering a range of echo times, and pulse-acquire spectra were acquired with the wire heater powered using high frequency AC or DC power sources and without any current flowing in order to assess the sensitivity of the MRI acquisitions to the presence of current flow through the heater wire. The efficacy of temperature maintenance using the AC heater was assessed by measuring rectal temperature immediately following induction of general anaesthesia for a period of 30 minutes in three different mice.Images and spectra acquired in the presence and absence of 50-100 kHz AC through the wire heater were indistinguishable, whereas DC power created field shifts and lineshape distortions. Temperature lost during induction of anaesthesia was recovered within approximately 20 minutes and a stable temperature was reached as the mouse's temperature approached the set target.The AC-powered wire heater maintains adequate heat input to the animal to maintain body temperature, and does not compromise image quality."

The oxidation-dependent dissociation of the Calstabin protein from the ryanodine receptor has been shown to result in reduced muscle function in mammals. The S107 molecule is able to reestablish this binding resulting in improved muscle function. We find that S107 is able to restore motor function in aging Drosophila to young levels, and this effect of S107 is absent in calstabin (FK506-BP2) mutants. Interestingly, FK506-BP2 mutant flies have reduced sensitivity to the effects of age and oxidative stress on motor function between 7 and 35 days of age. Muscle expression of FK506-BP2 in FK506-BP2 mutants completely restores the sensitivity of motor function to both age and oxidative stress, supporting the idea that the age-dependent decline in motor function in Drosophila requires FK506-BP2 function within the muscle. Although FK506-BP2 mutant flies are found to have less sensitivity to oxidative stress, FK506-BP2 mutants do not live longer than wild type. These results demonstrate that the deleterious effects of oxidation on motor function early in life are the result of a singular event that does not compromise survival."
https://openalex.org/W2547162990,"Apoptosis mediated by Bax or Bak is usually thought to be triggered by BH3-only members of the Bcl-2 protein family. BH3-only proteins can directly bind to and activate Bax or Bak, or indirectly activate them by binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, thereby relieving their inhibition of Bax and Bak. Here we describe a third way of activation of Bax/Bak dependent apoptosis that does not require triggering by multiple BH3-only proteins. In factor dependent myeloid (FDM) cell lines, cycloheximide induced apoptosis by a Bax/Bak dependent mechanism, because Bax-/-Bak-/- lines were profoundly resistant, whereas FDM lines lacking one or more genes for BH3-only proteins remained highly sensitive. Addition of cycloheximide led to the rapid loss of Mcl-1 but did not affect the expression of other Bcl-2 family proteins. In support of these findings, similar results were observed by treating FDM cells with the CDK inhibitor, roscovitine. Roscovitine reduced Mcl-1 abundance and caused Bax/Bak dependent cell death, yet FDM lines lacking one or more genes for BH3-only proteins remained highly sensitive. Therefore Bax/Bak dependent apoptosis can be regulated by the abundance of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Mcl-1, independently of several known BH3-only proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2548453704,"Background To tackle the high prevalence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in North Korea, it is essential that birth doses of HBV vaccines should be administered within 24 hours of birth. As the country fails to provide a Timely Birth Dose (TBD) of HBV vaccine, the efforts of reducing the high prevalence of HBV have been significantly hampered. Methods To examine the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies to prevent perinatal transmission of HBV in North Korea, we established a decision tree with a Markov model consisting of selective, universal, and the country’s current vaccination program against HBV. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from societal and payer’s perspectives and evaluated by Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). Results The results suggest that introducing the universal vaccination would prevent 1,866 cases of perinatal infections per 100,000 of the birth cohort of 2013. Furthermore, 900 cases of perinatal infections per 100,000 could be additionally averted if switching to the selective vaccination. The current vaccination is a dominated strategy both from the societal and payer’s perspective. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) between universal and selective vaccination is $267 from the societal perspective and is reported as $273 from the payer’s perspective. Conclusion Based on the assumption that the 2012 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in North Korea, $582.6 was set for cost-effectiveness criteria, the result of this study indicates that selective vaccination may be a highly cost-effective strategy compared to universal vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2546653237,"Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) can be formally implemented by various methods. This study compares suitability of four selected MCDM methods, namely WPM, TOPSIS, VIKOR, and PROMETHEE, for future applications in agent-based computational economic (ACE) models of larger scale (i.e., over 10 000 agents in one geographical region). These four MCDM methods were selected according to their appropriateness for computational processing in ACE applications. Tests of the selected methods were conducted on four hardware configurations. For each method, 100 tests were performed, which represented one testing iteration. With four testing iterations conducted on each hardware setting and separated testing of all configurations with the-server parameter de/activated, altogether, 12800 data points were collected and consequently analyzed. An illustrational decision-making scenario was used which allows the mutual comparison of all of the selected decision making methods. Our test results suggest that although all methods are convenient and can be used in practice, the VIKOR method accomplished the tests with the best results and thus can be recommended as the most suitable for simulations of large-scale agent-based models."
https://openalex.org/W2547761576,"Selenocysteine (Sec) is a critical residue in at least 25 human proteins that are essential for antioxidant defense and redox signaling in cells. Sec is inserted into proteins cotranslationally by the recoding of an in-frame UGA termination codon to a Sec codon. In eukaryotes, this recoding event requires several specialized factors, including a dedicated, Sec-specific elongation factor called eEFSec, which binds Sec-tRNASec with high specificity and delivers it to the ribosome for selenoprotein production. Unlike most translation factors, including the canonical elongation factor eEF1A, eEFSec readily localizes to the nucleus of mammalian cells and shuttles between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. The functional significance of eEFSec’s nuclear localization has remained unclear. In this study, we have examined the subcellular localization of eEFSec in the context of altered Sec incorporation to demonstrate that reduced selenoprotein production does not correlate with changes in the nuclear localization of eEFSec. In addition, we identify several novel sequences of the protein that are essential for localization as well as Sec insertion activity, and show that eEFSec utilizes CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway. Our findings argue for two distinct pools of eEFSec in the cell, where the cytoplasmic pool participates in Sec incorporation and the nuclear pool may be involved in an as yet unknown function."
https://openalex.org/W2548649415,"The objective of this study was to extend our previous research and to further characterize the humoral immune responses against HIV-1 p24, gp41 and the specific peptides carrying the immunodominant epitopes (IDEs) that react with human serum samples from HIV-1-infected individuals in China. We found that the majority (90.45%, 180/199) of the samples did not react with any of the three HIV-1 p24 peptides carrying IDEs, but did react with the recombinant full-length p24, suggesting that these samples tested in China were primarily directed against the conformational epitopes of HIV-1 p24. In contrast, 84.54% (164/194) of the samples reacted with at least one HIV-1 linear gp41 peptide, in particular the gp41-p1 peptide (amino acids 560-616). Both recently and long-term HIV-1-infected individuals displayed similar humoral immune responses against the recombinant gp41. However, samples from long-term HIV-1-infected subjects but not from recently infected subjects, showed a very strong reaction against the gp41-p1 peptide. The different response patterns observed for the two groups against the gp41 and the peptide gp41-p1 were statistically significant (P<0.01, Chi-square test). These results have direct relevance and importance for design of improved HIV-1 p24 detection assays and the gp41- based immunoassay that can be used to reliably distinguish recent and long-term HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2549031409,"The aim of this study was to determine whether the internal model regulating grip force (GF)/load force (LF) coordination during a brisk load increase is preserved when the lower extremities produce a perturbation during a single step-down task. We observed the coordination of the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), GF and LF while holding a handheld object during a single step-down task. The 3 forces (vGRF, GF and LF) decreased during the start of the task. While the subject was descending, LF and GF became dissociated from vGRF and increased in value, probably to anticipate the first foot contact. Coordination of LF and GF was maintained until the maximal vGRF (knee extension). LF peaked in the same time window as vGRF, whereas GF peaked about 70 ms later. This desynchronization, which was previously observed in direct load increase on a handheld object, was interpreted to be a predictive action to ensure the smooth management of the brisk increase in load induced by the lower extremities. Incidentally, in this group, kinematic and dynamic differences were observed between men and women, which may highlight a gender-specific strategy to perform the step-down task. In conclusion, these results suggest that the internal model of precision grip is able to integrate a brisk load change, whatever its origin, and regulate the forces to provide an ideal GF to dampen a brisk load increase and secure the object."
https://openalex.org/W2547210335,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are powerful tools for basic and translational research, as well as regenerative medicine. In routine human in vitro fertilization (IVF) practices, cumulus cells (CCs) are discarded, representing a potential source of biological materials for regenerative medicine. In this study, we derived patient-specific iPSCs using CCs from human infertility clinics for the first time. The human cumulus cell derived iPSCs (hc-iPSCs) were characterized for growth, karyotype, expression of pluripotency genes, and were subjected to embryoid bodies (EBs) and teratoma assays to evaluate their differentiation capacity. Hc-iPSCs display typical iPSC characteristics, and are capable of differentiating into all germ layers in vitro and in vivo. We further show that putative primordial germ cell like cells (PGCLCs) can be derived using hc-iPSCs. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of deriving patient-specific pluripotent stem cells using CCs."
https://openalex.org/W2951390915,"Lander-Waterman's coverage bound establishes the total number of reads required to cover the whole genome of size G bases. In fact, their bound is a direct consequence of the well-known solution to the coupon collector's problem which proves that for such genome, the total number of bases to be sequenced should be O(G ln G). Although the result leads to a tight bound, it is based on a tacit assumption that the set of reads are first collected through a sequencing process and then are processed through a computation process, i.e., there are two different machines: one for sequencing and one for processing. In this paper, we present a significant improvement compared to Lander-Waterman's result and prove that by combining the sequencing and computing processes, one can re-sequence the whole genome with as low as O(G) sequenced bases in total. Our approach also dramatically reduces the required computational power for the combined process. Simulation results are performed on real genomes with different sequencing error rates. The results support our theory predicting the log G improvement on coverage bound and corresponding reduction in the total number of bases required to be sequenced."
