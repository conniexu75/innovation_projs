https://openalex.org/W1973075378,"Silencer elements, by analogy to enhancer elements, function independently of their position and orientation. We show that the chicken lysozyme silencer S-2.4 kb has many other characteristics in common with enhancer elements. The silencer is comprised of modules that independently repress gene activity-repression being increased synergistically when different or identical modules are combined. Repression is effective both on a complete and on a minimal promoter consisting of a TATA box only. One silencer module is bound in vitro by a 75–93 kd protein, termed NeP1; the other can be bound either by the product of the oncogene v-erbA or by the thyroid hormone receptor. This erbA binding site is unusual in that the palindromic sequence is inverted."
https://openalex.org/W2028043537,"Genetic studies of adeno-associated virus (AAV) indicate that two AAV genes are required for viral DNA replication: the palindromic terminal repeat, which is the origin for DNA replication, and the rep gene, which codes for a family of at least four viral nonstructural proteins. To determine the biochemical function of the Rep proteins, we have purified the AAV Rep68 protein to apparent homogeneity. We find that it contains a site-specific and strand-specific endonuclease activity that specifically cuts the AAV origin at the terminal resolution site (TRS). The TRS endonuclease requires the presence of ATP for activity and becomes covalently attached to the 5' end at the cut site. In addition to the specific endonuclease activity, Rep68 also contains a DNA helicase activity. These results demonstrate that the large AAV Rep proteins have a direct role in AAV DNA replication; namely, they provide the activities required for the resolution of covalently joined AAV termini."

https://openalex.org/W1574875334,"Cofilin is a widely distributed actin-modulating protein that has the ability to bind along the side of F-actin and to depolymerize F-actin in a pH-dependent manner. We found that phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PIP), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) inhibited both actions of cofilin in a dose-dependent manner, while inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), phosphatidylserine (PS), or phosphatidylcholine (PC) had little or no effect on them. Gel filtration analyses showed that PIP2 bound to cofilin and thereby inhibited the binding of cofilin to G-actin. Destrin is a mammalian, pH-independent actin-depolymerizing protein. The actin-depolymerizing activity of destrin was also inhibited by PI, PIP, and PIP2, but not by IP3, OAG, PS, or PC. In addition, we found further that an actin-depolymerizing activity of bovine pancreas deoxyribonuclease I, a G-actin-sequestering protein, was inhibited by PIP and PIP2, but not by PI, IP3, OAG, PS, or PC. These results together with previous findings (Lassing, I., and Lindberg, U. (1985) Nature 314, 472-474; Janmey, P. A., and Stossel, T. P. (1987) Nature 325, 362-364) suggest that the sensitivity to polyphosphoinositides may be a common feature in vitro among actin-binding proteins that can bind to G-actin and regulate the state of actin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1553668020,"We have recently shown that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) inhibits adenylate cyclase activity in rat platelets where only one population of ANF receptors (ANF-R2) is present, indicating that ANF-R2 receptors may be coupled to the adenylate cyclase/cAMP system. In the present studies, we have used ring-deleted peptides which have been reported to interact with ANF-R2 receptors also called clearance receptors (C-ANF) without affecting the guanylate cyclase/cGMP system, to examine if these peptides can also inhibit the adenylate cyclase/cAMP system. Ring-deleted analog C-ANF4-23 like ANF99-126 inhibited the adenylate cyclase activity in a concentration-dependent manner in rat aorta, brain striatum, anterior pituitary, and adrenal cortical membranes. The maximal inhibition was about 50-60% with an apparent Ki between 0.1 and 1 nM. In addition, C-ANF4-23 also decreased the cAMP levels in vascular smooth muscle cells in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting the cGMP levels. The maximal decrease observed was about 60% with an apparent Ki of about 1 nM. Furthermore, C-ANF4-23 was also able to inhibit cAMP levels and progesterone secretion stimulated by luteinizing hormone in MA-10 cell line. Other smaller fragments of ANF with ring deletions were also able to inhibit the adenylate cyclase activity as well as cAMP levels. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of various agonists such as 5'-(N-ethyl)carboxamidoadenosine, dopamine, and forskolin on adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP levels were also significantly inhibited by C-ANF4-23. The inhibitory effect of C-ANF4-23 on adenylate cyclase was dependent on the presence of GTP and was attenuated by pertussis toxin treatment. These results indicate that ANF-R2 receptors or so-called C-ANF receptors are coupled to the adenylate cyclase/cAMP signal transduction system through inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein."
https://openalex.org/W1558614105,"Human single-stranded DNA binding protein (human SSB) is a multisubunit protein containing polypeptides of 70, 34, and 11 kDa that is required for SV40 DNA replication in vitro. In this report we identify the functions of the SSB and its individual subunits in SV40 DNA replication. The 70 kDa subunit was found to bind to single-stranded DNA, whereas the other subunits did not. Four monoclonal antibodies against human SSB were isolated which inhibited SV40 DNA replication in vitro. The antibodies have been designated alpha SSB70A, alpha SSB70B, alpha SSB70C, and alpha SSB34A to indicate which subunits are recognized. Immunolocalization experiments indicated that human SSB is a nuclear protein. Human SSB is required for the SV40 large tumor antigen-catalyzed unwinding of SV40 DNA and stimulates DNA polymerases (pol) alpha and delta. The DNA unwinding reaction and stimulation of pol delta were blocked by alpha SSB70C, whereas the stimulation of pol alpha by human SSB was unaffected by this antibody. Conversely, alpha SSB70A, -70B, and -34A inhibited the stimulation of pol alpha, but they had no effect on DNA unwinding and pol delta stimulation. None of the antibodies inhibited the binding of SSB to single-stranded DNA. These results suggest that DNA unwinding and stimulation of pol alpha and pol delta are required functions of human SSB in SV40 DNA replication. The human SSB 70-kDa subunit appears to be required for DNA unwinding and pol delta stimulation, whereas both the 70- and 34-kDa subunits may be involved in the stimulation of pol alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1961410890,"Pyrococcus furiosus ferredoxin is the only known example of a ferredoxin containing a single [4Fe-4S] cluster that has non-cysteinyl ligation of one iron atom, as evidenced by the replacement of a ligating cysteine residue by an aspartic acid residue in the amino acid sequence. The properties of the iron-sulfur cluster in both the aerobically and anaerobically isolated ferredoxin have been characterized by EPR, magnetic circular dichroism, and resonance Raman spectroscopies. The anaerobically isolated ferrodoxin contains a [4Fe-4S]+,2+ cluster with anomalous properties in both the oxidized and reduced states which are attributed to aspartate and/or hydroxide coordination of a specific iron atom. In the reduced form, the cluster exists with a spin mixture of S = 1/2 (20%) and S = 3/2 (80%) ground states. The dominant S = 3/2 form has a unique EPR spectrum that can be rationalized by an S = 3/2 spin Hamiltonian with E/D = 0.22 and D = +3.3 +/- 0.2 cm-1. The oxidized cluster has an S = 0 ground state, and the resonance Raman spectrum is characteristic of a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster except for the unusually high frequency for the totally symmetric breathing mode of the [4Fe-4S] core, 342 cm-1. Comparison with Raman spectra of other [4Fe-4S]2+ centers suggests that this behavior is diagnostic of anomalous coordination of a specific iron atom. The iron-sulfur cluster is shown to undergo facile and quantitative [4Fe-4S] in equilibrium [3Fe-4S] interconversion, and the oxidized and reduced forms of the [3Fe-4S] cluster have S = 1/2 and S = 2 ground states, respectively. In both redox states the [3Fe-4S]0,+ cluster exhibits spectroscopic properties analogous to those of similar clusters in other bacterial ferredoxins, suggesting non-cysteinyl coordination for the iron atom that is removed by ferricyanide oxidation. Aerobic isolation induces partial degradation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster to yield [3Fe-4S] and possibly [2Fe-2S] centers. Evidence is presented to show that only the [4Fe-4S] form of this ferredoxin exists in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1572793754,"SecA is an acidic, peripheral membrane protein involved in the translocation of secretory proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. The direct interaction of SecA with secretory proteins was demonstrated by means of chemical cross-linking with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminoprophyl)carbodiimide. OmpF-Lpp, a model secretory protein, carries either an uncleavable or cleavable signal peptide, and mutant secretory proteins derived from uncleavable OmpF-Lpp were used as translocation substrates. The interaction was SecA-specific. None of the control proteins, which are as acidic as SecA, was cross-linked with uncleavable OmpF-Lpp. The interaction was signal peptide-dependent. The interaction was increasingly enhanced as the number of positively charged amino acid residues at the amino-terminal region of the signal peptide was increased, irrespective of the species of amino acid residues donating the charge. Finally, parallelism was observed between the efficiency of interaction and that of translocation among mutant secretory proteins. It is suggested that precursors of secretory proteins interact with SecA to initiate the translocation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1534335694,"Complementary DNAs for the G protein alpha subunits Gi alpha 1, Gi alpha 2, Gi alpha 3, and Go alpha were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the four proteins were purified to homogeneity. The recombinant proteins exchange and hydrolyze guanine nucleotide, are ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin, and interact with beta gamma subunits. The rates of dissociation of GDP from Gi alpha 1 and Gi alpha 3 (0.03 min-1) are an order of magnitude slower than that from rGo alpha; release of GDP from Gi alpha 2 is also relatively slow (0.07 min-1). However, the values of kcat for the hydrolysis of GTP by rGo alpha and the three rGi alpha proteins are approximately the same, about 2 min-1 at 20 degrees C. The recombinant proteins restore inhibition of Ca2+ currents in pertussis toxin-treated dorsal root ganglion neurons in response to neuropeptide Y and bradykinin, indicating that the proteins can interact functionally with all necessary components of at least one signal transduction system. The two different receptors function with different arrays of G proteins to mediate their responses, since all four G proteins restored responses to bradykinin, while Gi alpha 2 was inactive with neuropeptide Y. Despite these results, high concentrations of activated Gi alpha proteins are without effect on adenylyl cyclase activity, either in the presence or absence of forskolin or Gs alpha, the G protein that activates adenylyl cyclase. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that G protein beta gamma subunits are primarily responsible for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1586220966,"Cholesterol efflux was studied in cultured mouse adipose cells after preloading with low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Exposure to complexes containing human apolipoprotein A-IV and L-alpha-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) as well as to human lipoprotein particles containing apolipoprotein A-IV but not apolipoprotein A-I and particles containing apolipoproteins A-IV and A-I showed that both artificial and native apolipoprotein A-IV-containing particles were able to promote cholesterol efflux at 37 degrees C as a function of time and concentration. The half-maximal concentration was found to be 0.3 X 10(-6) M for apolipoprotein A-IV.DMPC complexes. Binding experiments performed in intact cells at 4 degrees C with labeled apolipoprotein A-IV.DMPC complexes showed the existence of specific binding sites, with a Kd value of 0.32 x 10(-6) M and a maximal binding capacity of 223,000 sites/cell. By cross-competition experiments with labeled and unlabeled complexes containing apolipoprotein A-IV, A-I, or A-II, it appeared that all three apolipoproteins bind to the same cell-surface recognition sites. It is suggested that apolipoprotein A-IV, which is present in the interstitial fluid surrounding adipose cells in vivo at concentrations similar to those required in vitro for the promotion of cholesterol efflux, plays a critical role in cholesterol removal from peripheral cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064579290,"Pharmacological characterization of Zn2+ effects on glutamate ionotropic receptors was investigated in Xenopus oocytes injected with rat brain mRNA, using a double microelectrode, voltage-clamp technique. At low concentration, Zn2+ inhibited NMDA currents (IC50 = 42.9 ± 1.3 μM) and potentiated both AMPA (EC50 = 30.0 ± 1.2 μM) and desensitized kainate responses (EC50 = 13.0 ± 0.1 μM). At higher concentrations, Zn2+ inhibited non-NMDA responses with IC50 values of 1.3 ± 0.1 mM and 1.2 ± 0.3 mM for AMPA and kainate, respectively. The potentiation of AMPA or quisqualate currents by Zn2+ was more than 2-fold, whereas that of the kainate current was only close to 30%. This potentiating effect of Zn2+ on AMPA current modified neither the affinity of the agonist for its site nor the current-voltage relationship. In addition, 500 μM Zn2+ differentially affected NMDA and non-NMDA components of the glutamate-induced response. The possible physiological relevance of Zn2+ modulation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1523615229,"Cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane proteins play a critical role in cellular processes involving interactions between membrane and cytosolic components. Activation of the phagocytic cell respiratory burst oxidase, the electron transport chain responsible for superoxide anion (O2-.) production, requires membrane components including cytochrome b558 and several cytosolic proteins; but the biochemical interactions of these components are poorly understood. Cytochrome b558 is an electron transport component of the oxidase. A role for cytochrome b558 in the organization or integration of other oxidase components has also been hypothesized. Antibodies binding the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail of the transmembrane 91-kDa subunit of cytochrome b558 specifically inhibited an amphiphile-activated cell-free O2-.-generating system that requires neutrophil membranes and cytosol. Synthetic peptides encompassing a 7-amino acid carboxyl-terminal sequence (RGVHFIF) within the same region of the 91-kDa subunit blocked activation of the oxidase by arachidonate, but did not affect activity of the assembled oxidase when added after arachidonate to the cell-free O2-.-generating system. The same peptides inhibited activation of the respiratory burst when allowed to diffuse into electrically permeabilized neutrophils before stimulation with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or phorbol myristate acetate. These studies define a functional cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane 91-kDa subunit of cytochrome b558 which may mediate interactions with other cellular proteins essential to activation of the phagocyte respiratory burst."
https://openalex.org/W1596313018,"The proteolytic targeting function of ubiquitin was investigated by a combination of site-specific mutagenesis and covalent modification. Lys48 was replaced by a cysteine via mutagenesis of a synthetic ubiquitin gene to generate the mutant Ub-C48. The single cysteine residue in Ub-C48 can be converted into a lysine analog by modification with the sulfhydryl-specific reagent, aminoethyl-8 (N-(iodoethyl)trifluoroacetamide). The resulting protein, Ub-(S-aminoethyl)C48, is equivalent to a wild type ubiquitin except for the substitution of a sulfur atom at the gamma carbon of Lys48. We have tested the ability of these two modified ubiquitins to target the degradation of an engineered beta-galactosidase substrate protein in ubiquitin-depleted reticulocyte lysates. Ub-C48 was unable to stimulate the degradation of this protein substrate although a monoubiquitinated beta-galactosidase was formed. In contrast, Ub-(S-aminoethyl)C48 appears to be as effective as wild type ubiquitin in targeting this substrate protein's degradation as well as the formation of multiply ubiquitinated beta-galactosidase intermediates. In conjunction with the cysteine substitution and modification, we have also examined the effects of blocking the amino groups in ubiquitin with reductive methylation. The methylation of either Lys48 in ubiquitin or its S-aminoethylcysteine counterpart abolished its proteolytic function while the blockage of the remaining six lysines in Ub-(S-aminoethyl)C48 did not alter its competence. Thus, of the seven lysine residues in ubiquitin, only Lys48 is essential. These results established unambiguously that a uniform multiubiquitin chain with ubiquitin-ubiquitin linkage solely at Lys48 is sufficient to target the degradation of a substrate protein in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1487576512,"Pyrophosphorolysis by bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase leads to the degradation of specific dideoxynucleotide-terminated fragments on DNA sequencing gels. This reaction can be prevented by pyrophosphatase. It is also inhibited by a high concentration of dNTPs; only the dNTP complementary to the next base in the template is an effective inhibitor, suggesting the formation of a stable polymerase-primer-template-nucleotide complex despite the absence of a 3' hydroxyl group on the primer. The use of pyrophosphatase, a genetically modified T7 DNA polymerase that lacks exonuclease activity, and Mn2+ rather than Mg2+ to eliminate discrimination between dideoxynucleotides and deoxynucleotides (Tabor, S., and Richardson, C. C. (1989) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 4076-4080) generates bands of uniform intensity on a DNA sequencing gel. Uniform band intensities simplify the analysis of a DNA sequence, particularly with automated procedures. For example, when genomic DNA is sequenced directly, heterozygotic sequences are readily detected because their bands have half the intensity of homozygotic sequences. A procedure for automated DNA sequencing is described that exploits the uniformity. A single reaction with a single labeled primer is carried out using four different ratios of dideoxynucleotides to deoxynucleotides; after gel electrophoresis in a single lane, the sequence is determined by the relative intensity of each band."
https://openalex.org/W1568585284,"P388D1 cells are stimulated by platelet-activating factor (PAF) to release arachidonic acid metabolites (Lister, M. D., Glaser, K. B., Ulevitch, R. J., and Dennis, E. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8520-8528). While the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in response to PAF is only two to three times the constitutive PGE2 production, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are able to prime P388D1 cells for enhanced arachidonic metabolism, increasing PAF-stimulating PGE2 production to 9-12 times the constitutive PGE2 production. The extent and rate of [3H]arachidonic acid release from prelabeled P388D1 cells are also increased in primed cells relative to unprimed cells in response to PAF-stimulation. LPS from either Salmonella Re595 or Escherichia coli 0111:B4 prime P388D1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner but have themselves no ability to stimulate arachidonic acid metabolism. LPS priming is sensitive to inhibition by actinomycin D, while primed PAF-stimulation of PGE2 production is blocked by cyclohexamide which implicates a protein which is rapidly turning over. Primed PAF stimulation is also inhibited by the phospholipase A2 inhibitor manoalogue and the tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitor genistein, but not by the kinase inhibitor H-7. These results suggest that priming amplifies signal transduction pathways for PAF, which results in increased arachidonate availability. The multiple levels at which primed PAF-stimulated PGE2 production appears to be regulated are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1604426609,"SecA is a protein translocation ATPase. The secA gene was engineered so as to code for SecA fragments of different sizes, either from the amino terminus or the carboxyl terminus. These SecA fragments, most of which formed aggregates in the cytosol, were overproduced and then purified in the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The fragments were renatured by means of dilution and dialysis, and then examined as to their ability to interact with ATP by means of photoaffinity cross-linking with [alpha-32P]ATP. Individual SecA fragments thus renatured were inactive as to ATP binding. However, when two fragments (amino- and carboxyl-terminal ones), which structurally complemented each other and which had an overlapping region, were mixed, cross-linking was observed at the amino-terminal segments. The cross-linking was appreciably enhanced when two such fragments were first mixed together in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and then renatured. It is concluded that SecA has an ATP-binding domain near its amino-terminal region and that the binding requires a carboxyl-terminal fragment that is large enough to cover the region deleted from the amino-terminal fragment. An amino-terminal fragment, which constituted about 92% of the entire SecA molecule, was active in not only ATP binding but also protein translocation. Based on these findings, the structure-function relationship of SecA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2007681273,"The influence of glycine on the desensitization of NMDA-induced currents was studied using cultured embryonic mouse neurons. Although glycine often appeared to reduce desensitization in the whole-cell mode, it had no effect on desensitization in outside-out patches. Various interpretations can be proposed for this discrepancy, such as the presence in intact cells of an intracellular factor regulating desensitization, or the masking of desensitization in intact cells by restricted diffusion of the agonist in the extracellular space. The fact that glycine potentiates the NMDA responses under conditions where it does not regulate desensitization indicates that the potentiation cannot be explained by a reduction of desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1483275313,"Expression of the rat gene designated S14 is rapidly and markedly induced by 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) in the liver. We have used nuclear run-on assays and transfection studies to explore the basis of this regulation. These studies indicate that T3 induction of hepatic S14 mRNA is due primarily, if not exclusively, to changes in the rate of gene transcription. Both alpha and beta forms of the thyroid hormone receptor (c-erbA) can activate S14 promoter activity in a co-transfection assay. This activation occurs in a dose-dependent manner and requires the expression of the T3 receptor from transfected cDNA in either COS-1 cells or primary rat hepatocytes. Delineation of sequences essential for control of S14 promoter activity indicates that multiple thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) are involved. These TREs have been localized in the far upstream 5'-flanking region of the S14 gene, approximately 2.7 kilobases from the S14 transcriptional initiation site. DNA-binding studies with in vitro translated c-erbA indicate that each of the S14 TREs contains a specific binding site for the receptor. The location of the S14 TREs far upstream from the promoter site may necessitate the presence of multiple TREs for hormonal responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2092245042,"The amino acid sequences of three fragments of cyanogen bromide-digested human placental inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate 2-phosphohydrolase, an enzyme of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, are identical to sequences within lipocortin III, a member of a family of homologous calcium- and phospholipid-binding proteins that do not have defined physiological functions. Lipocortin III has also been previously identified as placental anticoagulant protein III (PAP III) and calcimedin 35α. Antibodies to PAP III detected PAP III and inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate 2-phosphohydrolase with identical reactivity on immunoblotting. In addition, inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate 2-phosphohydrolase was stimulated by the same acidic phospholipids that bind lipocortins."
https://openalex.org/W2160303375,"Besides its role in the control of the rate of functioning of each Na-K-ATPase unit (as a substrate of the enzyme), the intracellular sodium concentration also regulates the number of active Na-K-ATPase units, as previously described in cultured cells. To evaluate such a possibility in kidney epithelial cells, the intracellular concentration of sodium in rat cortical collecting tubules (CCT) maintained in vitro was altered by the use of the sodium ionophore nystatin. When CCT were preincubated for 2-3 h at 37 degrees C in the presence of nystatin, the enzymatic activity of Na-K-ATPase was markedly stimulated as compared to tubules preincubated without nystatin or in the presence of the ionophore but in the absence of extracellular sodium. Although nystatin increased both Na-K-ATPase activity and [3H]ouabain specific binding in CCT, its action was independent of de novo synthesis of the pump since neither actinomycin D nor cycloheximide abolished it. It is suggested that increasing the sodium concentration in CCT cells induces the recruitment of a latent pool of Na-K-ATPase units. The size of this latent pool of enzyme is under the control of corticosteroids as it is markedly decreased in CCT from adrenalectomized rats."
https://openalex.org/W1541607559,"Interactions of nuclear proteins with cis-control elements are involved in the programmed developmental expression of the islet polypeptide hormone genes. Three transcriptional control elements within 300 base pairs of the 5'-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene interact with regulatory cellular proteins and direct transcription only in glucagon-producing islet cells. Two islet cell-specific enhancer-like elements (G2, G3) act together with the glucagon promoter (including the G1 element), which confers A cell specificity of glucagon gene expression. In the present study, the G3 element was analyzed in detail by protein binding and in vivo and in vitro transcription assays. Mutational analyses showed that the sequence of the G3 element comprises two distinct protein-binding domains: a more upstream domain A (5'-CGCCTGA-3'), and a more downstream domain B (5'GATTGAAGGGTGTA-3'). Binding of proteins to these two domains is mutually exclusive. Domain A, but not domain B, is responsible for both functional protein binding and the enhancement of transcription from the glucagon or thymidine kinase gene promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene transfected in vivo into glucagon-producing islet cells (InR1-G9) and transcribed in vitro in a HeLa cell-free transcription system. In islet cell extracts, the Southwestern blot technique labeled a protein of 45 kDa binding to domain A within G3. We conclude that although the G3 sequence contains two protein-binding motifs, the organization of the G3 enhancer-like element is not bipartite. The islet cell specificity of the G3 element is conferred by a tissue-specific transcription factor or protein complex interacting with domain A of G3. This protein or protein complex recognizes different DNA sequences and provides promoter as well as enhancer activity because it binds also to the apparently unrelated sequence of the G1 promoter element."
https://openalex.org/W1566260385,"We have used genetic and biochemical techniques to study carotenoid biosynthesis (crt) mutants of Rhodobacter capsulatus, a purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium. All nine identified crt genes are located within the 46-kilobase pair photosynthesis gene cluster, and eight of the crt genes form a subcluster. We have studied the operon structure of the crt gene cluster using transposon Tn5.7 mutants. The Tn5.7 insertion sites in 10 mutants have been mapped to high resolution (25-267 base pairs) by Southern hybridization. Two insertions each map within the coding regions of the crtA, crtC, crtE, and crtF genes, and one insertion lies within the crtI gene. The insertion in crtI is not polar on the downstream crtB gene, suggesting that crtI and crtB may form two separate operons. Another insertion located in the 5' noncoding region between the divergent crtA and crtI genes has no effect on wild-type pigmentation and apparently lies between the promoters for these operons. A Tn5.7 mutation in the 3' region of crtA yields a bacteriochlorophyll-minus phenotype, while a 5' insertion affects only carotenoid biosynthesis. Regulatory signals for transcription of a downstream operon required for bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis may thus overlap the coding region of crtA. We also present the first evidence for the functions of the crtB, crtE, and crtJ gene products using a new in vitro assay for the incorporation of [14C]isopentenyl pyrophosphate into carotenoid precursors and phytoene in cell-free extracts. Extracts from a crtE mutant accumulate [14C]prephytoene pyrophosphate, while those from crtB and crtJ mutants accumulate [14C]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. We therefore propose that CrtE is the phytoene synthetase and that CrtB, and possibly CrtJ, are components of the prephytoene pyrophosphate synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1536005676,"The single nuclear gene encoding human ubiquinone-binding protein, a subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex, was isolated previously (Suzuki, H., Hosokawa, Y., Toda, H., Nishikimi, M., and Ozawa, T. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 161, 371-378). The 5'-flanking region contains four putative CCAAT boxes, one putative NF-Y-binding site, and one sequence homologous to the AP-1 recognition site, but lacks typical TATA and GC boxes. Three common nucleotide sequences (5'-TATTCAGGT-3', 5'-ATCTGGCT-3', and 5'-TGGTGA(T/G)AG-3', designated Mt1, Mt3, and Mt4, respectively) were found in the 5'-flanking regions of the genes for human ubiquinone-binding protein and for human cytochrome c1, another subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex. All three sequences are located in the 280-base pair BamHI-HindIII fragment of the ubiquinone-binding protein gene and in the 154-base pair SalI-PstI fragment of the cytochrome c1 gene. Interestingly, a computer-assisted homology search revealed that the SalI-PstI fragment of the cytochrome c1 gene is related to the long terminal repeat of an endogenous retrovirus. Sequences highly homologous to the three Mt-sequences were also found in the 5'-flanking regions of the genes for the beta subunit of human F0F1-ATPase and rat somatic cytochrome c. The Mt1 sequence (TATT-CAGGT) is similar to the GFII recognition site (RTCACGTG) found in the 5'-flanking regions of the yeast nuclear genes for three cytochrome bc1 complex subunits. Gel retardation assay demonstrated that protein factors in a whole HeLa cell extract bound to both of those fragments. At least three different specific binding sites were thought to exist in the fragments. Specific binding of the protein factors to the sites, possibly to the three Mt sequences, may play an important role in the coordinate regulation of the transcription of nuclear genes encoding subunits responsible for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2016629308,"Anesthesia ""cutoff"" refers to the phenomenon of loss of anesthetic potency in a homologous series of alkanes and their derivatives when their sizes become too large. In this study, hydrogen bonding of 1-alkanol series (ethanol to eicosanol) to dipalmitoyl-L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in DPPC-D2O-in-CCl4 reversed micelles. The alkanols formed hydrogen bonds with the phosphate moiety of DPPC and released the DPPC-bound deuterated water, evidenced by increases in the bound O-H stretching signal of the alkanol-DPPC complex and also in the free O-D stretching band of unbound D2O. These effects increased according to the elongation of the carbon chain of 1-alkanols from ethanol (C2) to 1-decanol (C10), but suddenly almost disappeared at 1-tetradecanol (C14). Anesthetic potencies of these alkanols, estimated by the activity of brine shrimps, were linearly related to hydrogen bond-breaking activities below C10 and agreed with the FTIR data in the cutoff at C10."
https://openalex.org/W1592117612,"Dexamethasone treatment of the Jurkat T77 cell clone inhibited the enhancing effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylporbol-13-acetate (TPA) and the calcium ionophore A23187 on the interleukin 2 (IL2) mRNA levels and gene transcription from intact nuclei. Dexamethasone treatment of Jurkat T77 cells inhibited the TPA/A23187-dependent activation of the transcription from the transfected pIL2CAT, containing 600 base pairs of the genomic sequences upstream of the coding region of IL2 gene, including the TPA/calcium responsive cis-regulatory elements and promoter sequences, driving the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Transfection of either Jurkat T77 cell clone or glucocorticoid-resistant Jurkat cells with a human glucocorticoid receptor cDNA under the transcriptional control of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (LTR) (pRShGR alpha) significantly increased or induced, respectively, the dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of the TPA/A23187-dependent expression of pIL2-CAT as well as the enhancing effect on the expression of the cotransfected CAT gene under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus LTR, as a marker of glucocorticoid receptor action. This suggests a role for the glucocorticoid receptor in mediating the dexamethasone action on IL2 gene expression. To study the cis-regulatory sequence specificity of the dexamethasone-induced interference with the TPA/A23187-mediated T cell activating signals, we studied the effect of the hormone on the regulatory elements contained in the Rous sarcoma virus and human T lymphotropic virus 1 long terminal repeats and the SV40 promoter, which are known to be transcriptionally enhanced by those activating agents. Dexamethasone was unable to interfere with the TPA/A23187-mediated enhancement of these cis-regulatory elements, suggesting that the hormone effect is specific for IL-2 gene sequences. Our data suggest that the dexamethasone-mediated transcriptional inhibition of the IL2 gene is mediated by an interference with the protein kinase C and calcium-mediated trans-activation of the antigen-responsive and T cell-specific elements lying in the 5'-flanking region of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1549096372,"Cyanide binding to bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase at five redox levels has been investigated by use of infrared and visible-Soret spectra. A C-N stretch band permits identification of the metal ion to which the CN- is bound and the oxidation state of the metal. Non-intrinsic Cu, if present, is detected as a cyanide complex. Bands can be assigned to Cu+CN at 2093 cm-1, Cu2+CN at 2151 or 2165 cm-1, Fe3+CN at 2131 cm-1, and Fe2+CN at 2058 cm-1. Fe2+CN is found only when the enzyme is fully reduced whereas the reduced Cu+CN occurs in 2-, 3-, and 4-electron reduced species. A band for Fe3+CN is not found for the complex of fully oxidized enzyme but is for all partially reduced species. Cu2+CN occurs in both fully oxidized and 1-electron-reduced oxidase. CO displaces the CN- at Fe2+ to give a C-O band at 1963.5 cm-1 but does not displace the CN- at Cu+. Another metal site, noted by a band at 2042 cm-1, is accessible only in fully reduced enzyme and may represent Zn2+ or another Cu+. Binding of either CN- or CO may induce electron redistribution among metal centers. The extraordinary narrowness of ligand infrared bands indicates very little mobility of the components that line the O2 reduction site, a property of potential advantage for enzyme catalysis. The infrared evidence that CN- can bind to both Fe and Cu supports the possibility of an O2 reduction mechanism in which an intermediate with a mu-peroxo bridge between Fe and Cu is formed. On the other hand, the apparent independence of Fe and Cu ligand-binding sites makes a heme hydroperoxide (Fe-O-O-H) intermediate an attractive alternative to the formation an Fe-O-O-Cu linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1580184135,"We show that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 22 residues of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV presequence blocked import of pre-subunit IV into yeast mitochondria. The 22-residue peptide pL4-(1-22) did not alter the electrical potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane (the delta psi). Inhibition of import was reversible and could be overcome by the addition of increased amounts of precursor. Two other peptides, pL4-(1-16) and pL4-(1-23), which correspond to, respectively, the N-terminal 16 and 23 residues of the same presequence, also blocked import of pre-subunit IV. However, pL4-(1-16) was a much weaker inhibitor of import, while the inhibitory effect of pL4-(1-23) was due to its ability to completely collapse the delta psi. pL4-(1-22) seems to be a general inhibitor of mitochondrial import, in that it also blocked uptake of several other proteins. These included the precursors of the yeast proteins cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va, the F1-ATPase beta subunit, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, and the ATP/ADP carrier. In addition, uptake of two non-yeast precursor proteins (human ornithine transcarbamylase and a cytochrome oxidase subunit IV-dihydrofolate reductase fusion), was also blocked by the peptide. Subsequent studies revealed that pL4-(1-22) did not block the initial recognition or binding of proteins to mitochondria. Rather, our results suggest that the peptide acts at a subsequent translocation step which is common to the import pathways of many different precursor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1490306683,"The effects of the local anesthetic bupivacaine on the oxidative phosphorylation in rat liver mitochondria were examined. Bupivacaine caused a maximum of about 7-fold stimulation of state 4 respiration at about 3 mM, released oligomycin-inhibited state 3 respiration, and activated ATPase to a similar extent to that by the weakly acidic uncoupler SF 6847. These effects were greatly enhanced by the addition of certain hydrophobic anions such as 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate, tetraphenyl borate, and picrate. In the absence of these anions, bupivacaine did not increase the proton conductance in either energized or nonenergized mitochondrial membranes or in artificial bilayer lipid membranes and did not have any effect on the proton motive force. However, it greatly enhanced the proton conductivity of these membrane systems and collapsed the proton motive force in the presence of hydrophobic anions. The results of noise analysis of artificial lipid bilayer membranes indicated that an ion pair complex of bupivacaine with hydrophobic anions formed a leakage-type ion pathway. Thus it is concluded that bupivacaine acts as a decoupler in the absence of added hydrophobic anions but in cooperation with certain anions as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation due to formation of a H(+)-specific pathway in the membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1580672895,"This study establishes the characteristics of electroneutral Na-H exchange present in apical membrane vesicles isolated from colonocytes of rat large intestine. An outward directed proton gradient stimulated 22Na uptake and demonstrated transient accumulation that was not altered by voltage clamping with K and its ionophore, valinomycin. Amiloride inhibited proton gradient-stimulated 22Na (0.1 mM) uptake by 97% by a noncompetitive mechanism with a Ki of 27 microM. 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride, an amiloride analogue which is a specific potent inhibitor of electroneutral Na-H exchange, inhibited proton gradient-stimulated 22Na uptake with a Ki of 400 nM. Increasing Na concentration saturated the proton gradient-stimulated 22Na uptake with an apparent Km of 11.7 +/- 2.2 mM. Increasing intravesicular proton concentration also resulted in saturation of 22Na uptake with a Km of 2.8 microM. Proton gradient-stimulated 22Na uptake was inhibited significantly by 10 mM Na+, Li+, and NH4+, while outward directed gradients of these ions in the absence of proton gradient accelerated 22Na uptake. The mechanism of Li+ inhibition of proton gradient-stimulated 22Na uptake was competitive with a Ki of 2 mM. 22Na uptake either stimulated by an outward directed Na gradient (i.e. Na-Na exchange) at pH 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5 or stimulated by 10-fold outward directed proton gradient at different pH values was similar; observations that do not suggest proton activation of Na-H exchange. We conclude from these results that proton gradient-stimulated 22Na uptake in colonic apical membrane vesicles represents tightly coupled electro-neutral Na-H exchange with several kinetic properties unlike those described in other epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W1507908059,"A series of DL-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) analogs, with a bulky substitutent on the 2nd carbon of the inositol ring, has been synthesized. These compounds exert biological activities with only minor reduction in potency, in several assay systems (Hirata, M., Watanabe, Y., Ishimatsu, T., Ikebe, T., Kimura, Y., Yamaguchi, K., Ozaki, S., and Koga, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20303-20308). Two analogs with aminocyclohexanecarbonyl (designated as analog 206) or aminobenzoyl group (analog 209) were separated into individual optical isomers and examined for stereospecificity in recognition by IP3-5-phosphatase, IP3-3-kinase and IP3 binding activity. IP3-5-phosphatase activity of erythrocyte ghosts was competitively inhibited by L-209 with a lower Ki value than D-IP3, but with a higher Ki value by L-206. D-Isomers of both analogs at 100 microM failed to inhibit the hydrolysis of D-[3H]IP3. On the other hand, D-isomers but not L-isomers of both analogs were as potent as D-IP3 in the recognition by IP3-3-kinase of rat brain cytosol and only the D-isomer of analog 206 could serve as substrate for the kinase. Also D-isomers of both analogs were equipotent to D-IP3 in displacing [3H]IP3 binding to rat cerebellum microsomes. These observations suggest that the IP3 analogs we synthesized are stereospecifically recognized by three IP3-recognizable proteins, but the phosphatase recognizes opposite isomers. Such being the case, the second hydroxyl group of D-IP3 may be involved in the recognition by IP3-5-phosphatase, but not by IP3-3-kinase and binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1611362805,"Following shocks with low voltage electric current, earthworms, Lumbricus terrestris, secrete a yellow mucus that has alarm properties for conspecifics and chemoattractive properties for garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis. A proteinaceous chemoattractant for garter snakes has been isolated and purified to homogeneity from such secretions by means of permeation chromatography and semipreparative nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified protein is highly attractive to garter snakes; it loses its activity after proteolytic digestion. It is a glycoprotein consisting of a single polypeptide chain with an NH2-terminal alanine. This chemoattractant has a minimum molecular mass of 15.4 kDa calculated from its amino acid and carbohydrate contents and an apparent molecular mass of about 20 kDa as estimated from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It has a pI of about 4.0, and it binds wheat germ agglutinin but not concanavalin A. This chemoattractant shows a protein to carbohydrate ratio of 2.0 +/- 0.08 (n = 5) and a ratio of total sugar to amino sugar of 1.9 +/- 0.08 (n = 3). The sequence of its NH2-terminal 15 amino acid residues has been determined. Studies were also conducted on the chemosignal transduction through the vomeronasal sensory system of the garter snake. Dot blot analysis showed that the purified chemoattractant bound to snake vomeronasal sensory epithelial membrane fractions. It did not bind to membrane extracts of the nonsensory epithelium of the vomeronasal mushroom body. The chemoattractant also bound specifically to vomeronasal sensory epithelial membrane in a reversible and saturable fashion with Kd and Bmax values of about 0.3 microM and 0.4 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. In electrophysiological studies, the chemoattractant applied to the vomeronasal epithelium caused an increase in firing rate of individual neurons in the accessory olfactory bulb of garter snakes, the projection site for vomeronasal neurons. The present results are the first clear biochemical and electrophysiological evidence for a vomeronasal epithelium response to a purified nonvolatile odorant, and this makes the garter snake vomeronasal system ideal for studying the mechanisms of chemosignal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1601044667,"Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) is an extracellular protein that has been suggested to participate in the visual process as a carrier for visual retinoids. A chimeric gene composed of the human IRBP promoter fused to the bacterial reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was used to generate transgenic mice. Analysis of six transgenic families revealed that the CAT gene, concomitant with the endogenous IRBP gene, was expressed primarily in the retina and, to a lesser extent, in the pineal gland. These results establish that a 1.3-kilobase fragment from the 5' end of the human IRBP gene is sufficient to direct transgene expression to a visual subdivision of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1569339613,"A variety of modifications of sialic acids have been described in nature. There are currently many difficulties in the detection and quantitation of these modified sialic acids from biological sources. We report here that fast-atom bombardment-mass-spectrometry (FAB-MS) of native sialic acids provides specific detection and quantitation of many previously known compounds. Derivatization of the sialic acids by reduction and peracylation under acidic conditions prior to FAB-MS provides further confirmation of their identity and improves the sensitivity of detection. Samples containing as little as 100 ng of a derivatized sialic acid loaded onto the FAB target allowed accurate identification. Mixtures of sialic acids could be analyzed, and minor components were seen, at levels undetectable by other currently known techniques. Analysis of known mixtures of different sialic acids gave reproducible relative signal intensities, indicating that quantitative data can be derived from the FAB-MS spectra. After reduction and peracylation, each sialic acid gave two major molecular ions, corresponding to the fully derivatized linear species and a lactone form, and a minor ion, corresponding to an anhydro form. Lactone formation was minimal in the case of four substituted sialic acids, indicating that the hydroxyl group at the 4-position is involved in lactonization. Differentiation between different positional isomers of the modified sialic acids could be achieved using controlled degradation with periodate, tagging of the fragments with p-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester under acid reducing conditions, peracylation, and FAB-MS of the derivatized products. We used this FAB-MS strategy to identify a novel sialic acid, 8-O-methyl-7,9-di-O-acetyl-N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid from the starfish Pisaster brevispinus, and to demonstrate the presence of a previously undetected sialic acid, 4,8-anhydro-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid in acid hydrolysates of horse serum. We also use FAB-MS to show that the alkaline conditions traditionally used for analytical de-O-acetylation of sialic acids causes substantial conversion of 4-O-acetylated sialic acids into the same anhydro compound."
https://openalex.org/W1589167027,"Although G proteins have been shown to regulate cation channels, regulation of Cl- channels by G proteins has not been demonstrated directly. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to examine whether a G protein regulates Cl- channels in the apical membrane of rabbit kidney CCD cells grown in culture. Previous studies showed that this channel is activated by adenosine and protein kinase C and has a single channel conductance of 305 picosiemens. The PCl-:PNa+ is 9:1 and the PCl-:PHCO3- is 2:1 (Schwiebert, E.M., Light, D.B., Dietl, P., Fejes-Toth, G., Naray-Fejes-Toth, A., and Stanton, B. (1990) Kidney Int. 37,216). In the present study, Cl- channels in the apical membrane of CCD cells were studied by the patch clamp technique. GTP and guanosine 5'-O(3-thiophosphate) (GTP gamma S), a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, increased the single channel open probability (Po). In contrast, guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiophosphate), a nonhydrolyzable analog of GDP, and pertussis toxin (PTX) decreased the Po. GTP gamma S, but not GTP, reversed PTX inhibition of the channel. The alpha i-3-subunit of Gi increased the Po in both untreated and PTX-treated membrane patches. Because GTP gamma S activated the Cl- channel in the presence of H8, a protein kinase inhibitor, we conclude that the G protein does not activate the channel by stimulating a protein kinase. Thus, a PTX-sensitive G protein activates a Cl- channel in the apical membrane of renal CCD cells."
https://openalex.org/W1545476397,"Human neutrophils (PMN) possess at least two distinct mechanisms for the ingestion of IgG-opsonized pathogens; one is independent of and the other is dependent on products of the respiratory burst. Oxidant-mediated ingestion is not induced by exposure to the IgG-opsonized target but requires additional stimulation by phorbol esters or cytokines. The purpose of the present work is to elucidate the signal transduction pathways underlying these two distinct phagocytic mechanisms. Both phorbol ester- and cytokine-stimulated ingestion of IgG-opsonized targets and superoxide anion production were inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors TFP and H7. In contrast, neither phagocytosis nor superoxide anion generation induced by stimulation with IgG-opsonized targets alone was affected by either of these inhibitors, even when IgG opsonization was increased to generate equal levels of ingestion and superoxide anion as that observed with cytokine stimulation. Moreover, TNF-alpha and IgG-opsonized target stimulation of PMN showed marked synergy in translocation of PKC activity from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. These data indicate that a pathway for activation of the respiratory burst which is dependent on protein kinase C is involved in oxidant-mediated amplification of ingestion. Cytokine stimulation of PMN not only augments IgG-dependent ingestion and generation of superoxide anion but also changes the signaling pathway for these two IgG-dependent functions from PKC-independent to PKC-dependent. In this regard, cytokine stimulation differentiates two pathways for activation of PMN by IgG."
https://openalex.org/W1508798492,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been shown to block the morphological and molecular events associated with myoblast differentiation. During fusion of C2 myoblasts, TGF-beta receptors are down-regulated, and muscle-specific genes become refractory to the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. To define further the mechanisms that modulate TGF-beta receptor expression during myogenesis, we have developed culture conditions that support the differentiation of C2 cells in the absence of fusion and have examined the expression of functional TGF-beta receptors in biochemically differentiated mononucleated myocytes. Exposure of C2 myoblasts to growth factor-deficient medium containing 1.4 mM [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) leads to withdrawal from the cell cycle and high level expression of muscle-specific mRNAs and proteins. Under these conditions, TGF-beta receptors fail to be down-regulated, and the differentiation program remains sensitive to repression by TGF-beta. These studies demonstrate that EGTA uncouples muscle-specific gene expression from fusion in C2 cells and that in the absence of fusion, C2 myocytes retain a functional TGF-beta signaling system."
https://openalex.org/W1599740626,"In the accompanying paper (Glaser, S. M., and Cumsky, M. G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8808-8816) we demonstrated that pL4-(1-22), a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 22 residues of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV presequence, blocked protein import into mitochondria. Import inhibition was reversible and occurred at a step subsequent to the initial recognition and binding of precursor proteins to the mitochondrial surface. In the present work we have studied the nature of the association between the peptide and mitochondria, as well as determined its intramitochondrial location. We found that pL4-(1-22) was imported into mitochondria in a manner that was dependent upon the delta psi and that the majority of the mitochondrially associated peptide was in the membrane fraction. Density gradient analysis of total membranes indicated that pL4-(1-22) cofractionated with the inner membrane, although the possibility that it was present in both membranes could not be ruled out. It appeared to be inserted within the bilayer since it could not be extracted with salts, chaotropic agents, or high pH. We observed a steady decrease in the amount of pL4-(1-22) found within peptide-treated mitochondria over time. Coincident with this decrease was an increase in the ability of those mitochondria to import and process precursor proteins, suggesting that the peptide was ultimately turned over. The results presented here correlate well with those of the accompanying paper. Together they suggest that pL4-(1-22) blocks import at the level of the mitochondrial membranes, although the exact nature of the import block is not yet clear."
https://openalex.org/W1580916182,"The rate of GTP hydrolysis by microtubules has been measured at tubulin subunit concentrations where microtubules undergo net disassembly. This was made possible by using microtubules stabilized against disassembly by reaction with ethylene glycol bis-(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS) as sites for the addition of tubulin-GTP subunits. The tubulin subunit concentration was varied from 25 to 90% of the steady state concentration, and there was no net elongation of stabilized microtubule seeds. The GTPase rate with EGS microtubules was linearly proportional to the tubulin-GTP subunit concentration when this concentration was varied by dilution and by using GDP to compete with GTP for the tubulin E-site. The linear dependence of the rate is consistent with a GTP mechanism in which hydrolysis is coupled to the tubulin-GTP subunit addition to microtubule ends. It is inconsistent with reaction schemes in which: microtubules are capped by a single tubulin-GTP subunit, which hydrolyzes GTP when a tubulin-GTP subunit adds to the end; hydrolysis occurs primarily in subunits at the interface of a tubulin-GTP cap and the tubulin-GDP microtubule core; hydrolysis is not coupled to subunit addition and occurs randomly in subunits in a tubulin-GTP cap. It was also found that GDP inhibition of the microtubule GTPase rate results from GDP competition for GTP at the tubulin subunit E-site. There is no additional effect of GDP on the GTPase rate resulting from exchange into tubulin subunits at microtubule ends."
https://openalex.org/W1508307357,"A spontaneous transformant derived from a mouse lung epithelial cell line exhibited decreased cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity. DEAE column chromatography demonstrated that this was caused by specific loss of the type I PKA isozyme (PKA I). Western immunoblot analysis indicated that indeed several mouse lung tumor-derived cell lines and spontaneous transformants of immortalized, nontumorigenic lung cell lines contained less PKA I regulatory subunit (RI) protein than normal cell lines. PKA II regulatory subunit protein differed only slightly among cell lines and showed no conspicuous trend between normal and neoplastic cells. The decrease in RI was apparently concomitant with decreased catalytic (C) subunit levels in neoplastic cells since no free catalytic subunit activity was detected by DEAE chromatography. Northern blot analysis using RI alpha and C alpha cDNA probes showed that the levels of RI alpha and C alpha mRNAs paralleled their intracellular protein concentrations; neoplastic cell lines contained significantly less RI alpha and C alpha mRNAs than the normal cell line. The decreased expression of both RI and C subunits therefore results in a net decrease of PKA I in neoplastic lung cells, an isozymic difference which may account for the differential effects of cAMP analogs on cell growth and differentiation in normal and neoplastic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1502310852,"A key step in the sorting of endocytosed ligands from their receptors is dissociation, which is triggered by the acidic pH of endosomes. To determine whether dissociation occurs synchronously for all ligands, we compared in Chinese hamster ovary cells the intracellular dissociation of insulin, which dissociates between pH 6.3 and 7.0, with that of lysosomal hydrolases bearing the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker (Man-6-P proteins), which dissociate around pH 5.8. Chinese hamster ovary cells were pulsed for 2 min with 125I-insulin, acid-washed to remove surface binding, and chased. During a 40-min period, about 50% of the internalized 125I-insulin was released intact via a retrocytotic pathway. Retrocytosis was not inhibited by monensin, suggesting that the release was not dependent on acidic endosomes. The remaining insulin dissociated from its receptor in an acidification-sensitive manner and was eventually degraded. Dissociation was 70% complete within 5 min of internalization. When cells were similarly incubated with 125I-Man-6-P proteins, about 35% of the internalized radioactivity was released during a 1-h chase, reflecting proteolytic maturation of the Man-6-P proteins. Dissociation of Man-6-P proteins was acidification-dependent (i.e. inhibited by monensin), and was 50% complete after about 11 min. The results indicate that acidification-dependent dissociation of ligands does not occur in a single step and suggest that multiple endocytic compartments are involved in receptor/ligand sorting."
https://openalex.org/W1522306017,"Most peptide hormones and neurotransmitters are synthesized as larger precursor proteins, which are post-translationally processed to mature bioactive products. An early event in prohormone maturation is endoproteolytic cleavage, occurring usually at pairs of basic amino acids (e.g. Lys-Arg). Since many of the characteristics of a prohormone endoprotease are unknown, distinguishing these enzymes from other cellular proteases in vitro has been difficult. In this report, the substrate specificity of a model prohormone processing system, the insulinoma cell line Rin m5F, was characterized in vivo to establish a set of criteria by which putative proinsulin endoproteases may be assessed. To determine the role of composition of the paired basic amino acid site in directing cleavage, a series of mutant prohormones containing altered cleavage sites was constructed and expressed in Rin m5F cells. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) was used as a substrate since this prohormone was previously shown to be processed by these cells. To control for positional effects, all four permutations of lysine and arginine (Lys-Arg, Arg-Arg, Arg-Lys, and Lys-Lys) were introduced at both the efficiently processed cleavage site separating the ACTH and beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) domains of POMC and at the inefficiently processed site in the beta-endorphin sequence near the COOH-terminus of the precursor. His-Arg and Met-Arg sites were also introduced at the ACTH/beta-LPH junction to assess the requirement for paired lysines and arginines. Identification of POMC-derived peptides demonstrated efficient processing of Lys-Arg and inefficient processing of Lys-Lys and Arg-Lys sites at both positions in the prohormone. The Arg-Arg sequence, however, was processed in a position-dependent manner, being efficiently cleaved between ACTH and beta-LPH but only about 50% processed within beta-endorphin. His-Arg was not cleaved in Rin m5F cells, although surprisingly Met-Arg was partially processed. These results indicate a strict preference of the insulinoma prohormone endoprotease(s) for paired basic amino acids ending in arginine, but that processing efficiency of some sequences may be modulated by location within the precursor molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1493296105,"A procedure combining immunoprecipitation and immunotransblot employing subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies of the brain phosphatase, VJ6 and VA1, was used on tissues including heart, muscle, lung, spleen, pancreas, uterus, and liver. The various tissue extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation by the beta subunit-specific VA1-immunoabsorbant, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunotransblot, using both the alpha and beta subunit-specific antibodies VJ6 and VA1, respectively. Protein bands corresponding to alpha and beta subunits and the immunostain of beta subunit were detected in all samples, whereas alpha subunit was strongly stained only in the brain extract, weakly in heart and muscle extracts, and essentially negatively in all the other samples. In contrast, a polyclonal antiserum of bovine brain calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase could immunostain both alpha and beta subunits from all tissues. Calmodulin-binding protein fractions from a number of bovine tissues were all shown to contain the immunoprecipitable alpha subunit, as well as calmodulin-stimulated p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity. Micropeptide mapping showed that alpha subunits of bovine brain and bovine lung calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase isozymes were distinct molecular species. These results provide direct evidences for the existence of calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase isozymes in mammalian tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1582761283,"The crucial role of collagen in fibrotic disorders has prompted attempts to develop drugs that inhibit collagen accumulation. Peptides containing the unphysiological amino acid 5-oxaproline (Opr) have recently been found to act as specific syncatalytic inactivators of pure prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens. The present study indicates that oxaproline-containing peptides benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Opr-Gly-benzyl ester (I) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Opr-Gly-ethyl ester (II) inactivate prolyl 4-hydroxylase in cultured human skin fibroblasts, peptide I being about twice as potent as peptide II. Inactivation by 50% was observed after culturing with about 20-40 microM concentrations of peptide I for 48 h. The inactivation appears to be specific, as no changes were found in the activities of two other intracellular enzymes of collagen synthesis, lysyl hydroxylase and galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase. Synthesis of 4-hydroxyproline by the cells was markedly decreased, and 4-hydroxyproline-deficient procollagen accumulated intracellularly, whereas no changes were found in the incorporation of [14C]leucine into protein after culturing of the cells with a 30 microM concentration of peptide I for 48 h. No changes were seen in the viability of the cells or the release of lactate dehydrogenase from them into the culture medium. No significant changes were found in the steady-state levels of the mRNAs for the pro-alpha 1 chains of type I and type III procollagens or for the alpha and beta subunits of prolyl 4-hyroxylase or fibronectin after culturing with 75 microM peptide I for 48 h. The data indicate that inactivation of cellular prolyl 4-hydroxylase has marked effects on cellular 4-hydroxyproline formation and collagen secretion but no effects on the steady-state levels of mRNAs for type I and III procollagens or the two types of subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase."

A protocol consisting of DEAE-cellulose, phenyl-Sepharose, and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography yielded a mixture of two proteins. The low molecular weight protein contaminant was removed by limited tryptic digestion leaving a purified enzyme consisting of a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 41,000. A weak, featureless uv spectrum above 300 nm suggested no common chromophoric cofactor contributes to enzyme activity and no protein-associated metals were detected. The stereospecificity of nicotinamide oxidation was determined to be pro-R stereospecific. Reduction of ferricyanide during NADH oxidation and confirmation of the intermediacy of O2- in the reaction flux suggested that enzyme-catalyzed H2O2 formation is not a direct two-electron reduction of molecular oxygen, but is rather the consequence of an enzymatic 2e-/1e- switch. The sugar deoxygenation reaction may therefore proceed through a radical mechanism."

P., English, D., and Gabig, T. G. (1988) Blood 72, 322-327). The present studies directed at identifying the molecular mechanism(s) involved in NADPH oxidase deactivation showed that a heat- and trypsin-insensitive species in the cytosolic fraction from normal unstimulated neutrophils was capable of deactivating the membrane-associated NADPH oxidase isolated from opsonized zymosan- or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated neutrophils. This cytosolic species also deactivated the cell-free-activated oxidase. Deactivation by this cytosolic species occurred in the absence of NADPH-dependent catalytic turnover and was reversible, since NADPH oxidase activity could be subsequently reactivated in the cell-free system. The sedimentable particulate fraction from unstimulated neutrophils did not demonstrate deactivator activity. Deactivator activity was demonstrated in the neutral lipid fraction of neutrophil cytosol extracted with chloroform:methanol. Following complete purification of cytosolic deactivator activity by thin layer chromatography and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, the deactivator species was shown to be a lipid thiobis ester compound by mass spectroscopy. Cellular metabolism of this compound in human neutrophils may reveal a unique mechanism for enzymatic control of the NADPH oxidase system and thereby play an important role in regulation of the inflammatory response."

D., and Sneed, T. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6412-6416). Half-maximal increase in protamine kinase activity occurred at about 1 nM insulin. This effect of insulin was detected only when 25 mM NaF or 50 mM KPO4 were included in the homogenization buffers and was not prevented by preincubation of the hepatocytes with 10 microM cycloheximide. Insulin stimulation of protamine kinase was maintained following chromatography of extracts on protamine-agarose, DEAE-cellulose, and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration. The apparent Mr of the protamine kinase from control and insulin-treated hepatocytes was 45,000 as estimated by gel permeation chromatography. Experiments utilizing partially purified protamine kinase from control and insulin-treated hepatocytes indicated that insulin did not affect the apparent Km for protamine, Mg2+, or ATP, but increased the Vmax for the protamine kinase reaction by 1.6-2-fold. Incubation with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A completely inactivated the protamine kinase from control and insulin-treated cells. The results indicate that the insulin-stimulated increase in protamine kinase activity may be due to a covalent modification, possibly phosphorylation, of the protamine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1526179151,"Specific transcription complexes were formed with yeast RNA polymerase I using a cognate oligoribotri-nucleotide primer (GCG) to initiate transcription on short synthetic single-stranded DNA templates. The templates were designed to limit the incorporation of a photoprobe, 4-thiouridine triphosphate, to a single unique position at the 3' terminus of the product RNA (position 12, 13, 14, or 15). The resulting transcription complexes were photolyzed to cross-link the bound transcript (radiolabeled with [alpha-32P]CTP) to the protein with the probe located at the catalytic site. Separation of the protein subunit components by 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analysis by autoradiography and silver staining revealed that the two largest subunits (A190 and A135) were radiolabeled. The ratio of subunit labeling (A190/A135) decreased as the RNA transcript increased from 12 to 15 nucleotides in length. This decrease in ratio resulted from a progressive reduction of A190 subunit labeling while the A135 subunit derivatization remained essentially constant. It was also observed that the DNA template was radiolabeled."
