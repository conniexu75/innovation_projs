Here, we identify that colorectal cancer (CRC) manifests with altered ILC3s that are characterized by reduced frequencies, increased plasticity, and an imbalance with T cells. We evaluated the consequences of these changes in mice and determined that a dialog between ILC3s and T cells via major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) is necessary to support colonization with microbiota that subsequently induce type-1 immunity in the intestine and tumor microenvironment. As a result, mice lacking ILC3-specific MHCII develop invasive CRC and resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Finally, humans with dysregulated intestinal ILC3s harbor microbiota that fail to induce type-1 immunity and immunotherapy responsiveness when transferred to mice. Collectively, these data define a protective role for ILC3s in cancer and indicate that their inherent disruption in CRC drives dysfunctional adaptive immunity, tumor progression, and immunotherapy resistance.

Interactions between mammals and microbes profoundly impact cancer (Dzutsev et al., 2017Dzutsev A. Badger J.H. Perez-Chanona E. Roy S. Salcedo R. Smith C.K. Trinchieri G. Microbes and Cancer.Annu.

This occurs through a number of well-described mechanisms, and vaccination is an important approach to prevent these infection-associated cancers (Grivennikov et al., 2010Grivennikov S.I. Greten F.R.

In contrast, mammals are continuously colonized with trillions of normally beneficial microbes, termed the microbiota, that also substantially impact cancer, but the mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood (Dzutsev et al., 2017Dzutsev A. Badger J.H. Perez-Chanona E. Roy S. Salcedo R. Smith C.K. Trinchieri G. Microbes and Cancer.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 35: 199-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar; Garrett, 2015Garrett W.S.

One important connection with cancer is the ability of the microbiota to modulate the immune system and promote chronic inflammation (Belkaid and Hand, 2014Belkaid Y. Hand T.W.

Cancer and inflammation: an old intuition with rapidly evolving new concepts.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 677-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This can occur in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is associated with a loss of immunologic tolerance, the development of inflammatory immune responses directed against intestinal microbiota (Maloy and Powrie, 2011Maloy K.J.

Itzkowitz S.H. Cancers complicating inflammatory bowel disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, most CRC cases develop independently of IBD and yet are still directly linked with substantial microbiota-dependent engagement of inflammatory pathways, such as the cytokine interleukin (IL)-23 and associated T helper (TH)17 cell responses (Langowski et al., 2006Langowski J.L.

It remains poorly defined how malignant transformation in the intestine promotes these inflammatory responses to the microbiota, and the development of novel strategies to prevent this outcome could be beneficial in CRC. Emerging evidence indicates that microbiota also substantially impacts the responsiveness of tumors to therapies, including revolutionary immune checkpoint blockade (Iida et al., 2013Iida N.

Provocative data from these studies demonstrated that the microbiota is required for the success of checkpoint blockade in mouse models, and further, that the composition or presence of specific microbes in patient populations are sufficient to augment therapeutic outcome when transferred to germ-free or antibiotics (ABX)-treated recipient mice (Vétizou et al., 2015Vétizou M.

Sugita K. et al.A defined commensal consortium elicits CD8 T cells and anti-cancer immunity.Nature. 2019; 565: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies demonstrated that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may be harnessed as a method to boost responsiveness to checkpoint blockade in resistant cancer patients (Baruch et al., 2021Baruch E.N. Youngster I. Ben-Betzalel G. Ortenberg R. Lahat A. Katz L. Adler K. Dick-Necula D. Raskin S. Bloch N. et al.Fecal microbiota transplant promotes response in immunotherapy-refractory melanoma patients.Science. 2021; 371: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar; Davar et al., 2021Davar D.

Pagliano O. et al.Fecal microbiota transplant overcomes resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients.Science. 2021; 371: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These studies provide one explanation for the variable response of individual cancer patients or tumor types to checkpoint blockade therapy (Sharma et al., 2017Sharma P. Hu-Lieskovan S. Wargo J.A. Ribas A. Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy.Cell. 2017; 168: 707-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). In particular, CRC and other gastrointestinal cancers demonstrate a remarkably poor response to checkpoint blockade, with a notable exception of tumors harboring high microsatellite instability (Le et al., 2015Le D.T. Uram J.N. Wang H. Bartlett B.R. Kemberling H. Eyring A.D. Skora A.D. Luber B.S. Azad N.S. Laheru D. et al.PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372: 2509-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (5658) Google Scholar). These studies provoke a number of fundamental gaps in knowledge, including a need to define the mechanisms by which the microbiota regulates checkpoint blockade, the pathways that control colonization with beneficial microbes, as well as the relevance of these findings to CRC patients who are known to exhibit microbiota dysbiosis and resistance to checkpoint blockade (Brennan and Garrett, 2016Brennan C.A.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a recently appreciated family of tissue-resident innate lymphocytes that play critical roles in regulating host-microbe interactions at mucosal barrier surfaces of the mammalian body (Artis and Spits, 2015Artis D. Spits H. The biology of innate lymphoid cells.Nature. 2015; 517: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar; Colonna, 2018Colonna M.

In particular, group 3 ILCs (ILC3s) are innate counterparts of TH17 cells, express retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt), are enriched in the intestine, and regulate interactions with the microbiota through production of cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22 (Sonnenberg and Artis, 2015Sonnenberg G.F.

ILC3s also play a broader role in modulating adaptive immunity through direct cellular interactions with T cells (Sonnenberg and Hepworth, 2019Sonnenberg G.F. Hepworth M.R. Functional interactions between innate lymphoid cells and adaptive immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19: 599-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The CCR6+ lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi)-like subset of ILC3s express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) and have the potential to process and present antigens to CD4 T cells (von Burg et al., 2014von Burg N.

Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human brain organoids, we attempted to simplify the complexities and demonstrate formation of forebrain-associated bilateral optic vesicles, cellular diversity, and functionality. Around day 30, brain organoids attempt to assemble optic vesicles, which develop progressively as visible structures within 60 days. These optic vesicle-containing brain organoids (OVB-organoids) constitute a developing optic vesicle's cellular components, including primitive corneal epithelial and lens-like cells, retinal pigment epithelia, retinal progenitor cells, axon-like projections, and electrically active neuronal networks. OVB-organoids also display synapsin-1, CTIP-positive myelinated cortical neurons, and microglia. Interestingly, various light intensities could trigger photosensitive activity of OVB-organoids, and light sensitivities could be reset after transient photobleaching. Thus, brain organoids have the intrinsic ability to self-organize forebrain-associated primitive sensory structures in a topographically restricted manner and can allow interorgan interaction studies within a single organoid."

https://openalex.org/W3195047309,"Understanding the growth and development of individual plants is of central importance in modern agriculture, crop breeding, and crop science. To this end, using 3D data for plant analysis has gained attention over the last years. High-resolution point clouds offer the potential to derive a variety of plant traits, such as plant height, biomass, as well as the number and size of relevant plant organs. Periodically scanning the plants even allows for performing spatio-temporal growth analysis. However, highly accurate 3D point clouds from plants recorded at different growth stages are rare, and acquiring this kind of data is costly. Besides, advanced plant analysis methods from machine learning require annotated training data and thus generate intense manual labor before being able to perform an analysis. To address these issues, we present with this dataset paper a multi-temporal dataset featuring high-resolution registered point clouds of maize and tomato plants, which we manually labeled for computer vision tasks, such as for instance segmentation and 3D reconstruction, providing approximately 260 million labeled 3D points. To highlight the usability of the data and to provide baselines for other researchers, we show a variety of applications ranging from point cloud segmentation to non-rigid registration and surface reconstruction. We believe that our dataset will help to develop new algorithms to advance the research for plant phenotyping, 3D reconstruction, non-rigid registration, and deep learning on raw point clouds.

https://openalex.org/W3194055126,"Social media has become an ideal platform for the propagation of rumors, fake news, and misinformation. Rumors on social media not only mislead online users but also affect the real world immensely. Thus, detecting the rumors and preventing their spread became an essential task. Some of the recent deep learning-based rumor detection methods, such as Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-GCN), represent rumor using the completed stage of the rumor diffusion and try to learn the structural information from it. However, these methods are limited to represent rumor propagation as a static graph, which isn't optimal for capturing the dynamic information of the rumors. In this study, we propose novel graph convolutional networks with attention mechanisms, named Dynamic GCN, for rumor detection. We first represent rumor posts with their responsive posts as dynamic graphs. The temporal information is used to generate a sequence of graph snapshots. The representation learning on graph snapshots with attention mechanism captures both structural and temporal information of rumor spreads. The conducted experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Dynamic GCN over the state-of-the-art methods in the rumor detection task."
https://openalex.org/W3194806548,"Gordon Moore famously observed that the number of transistors in state-of-the-art integrated circuits (units per chip) increases exponentially, doubling every 12-24 months. Analysts have debated whether simple exponential growth describes the dynamics of computer processor evolution. We note that the increase encompasses two related phenomena, integration of larger numbers of transistors and transistor miniaturization. Growth in the number of transistors per unit area, or chip density, allows examination of the evolution with a single measure. Density of Intel processors between 1959 and 2013 are consistent with a biphasic sigmoidal curve with characteristic times of 9.5 years. During each stage, transistor density increased at least tenfold within approximately six years, followed by at least three years with negligible growth rates. The six waves of transistor density increase account for and give insight into the underlying processes driving advances in processor manufacturing and point to future limits that might be overcome."

Using transgenic reporter mice and human cerebral organoids, we found that <i>Neurog2</i> and <i>Ascl1</i> expression defines a continuum of four lineage-biased neural progenitor cell (NPC) pools. Double<sup>+</sup> NPCs, at the hierarchical apex, are least lineage restricted due to Neurog2-Ascl1 cross-repression and display unique features of multipotency (more open chromatin, complex gene regulatory network, G<sub>2</sub> pausing). Strikingly, selectively eliminating double<sup>+</sup> NPCs by crossing <i>Neurog2-Ascl1</i> split-Cre mice with diphtheria toxin-dependent ""deleter"" strains locally disrupts Notch signaling, perturbs neurogenic symmetry, and triggers cortical folding.

https://openalex.org/W3193894665,"Citizen science plays an important role in observing the natural environment. While conventional citizen science consists of organized campaigns to observe a particular phenomenon or species there are also many ad hoc observations of the environment in social media. These data constitute a valuable resource for ‘passive citizen science’—the use of social media that are unconnected to any particular citizen science program, but represent an untapped dataset of ecological value. We explore the value of passive citizen science, by evaluating species distributions using the photo sharing site Flickr. The data are evaluated relative to those submitted to the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Atlas, the largest collection of species distribution data in the UK. Our study focuses on the 1500 best represented species on NBN, and common invasive species within UK, and compares the spatial and temporal distribution with NBN data. We also introduce an innovative image verification technique that uses the Google Cloud Vision API in combination with species taxonomic data to determine the likelihood that a mention of a species on Flickr represents a given species. The spatial and temporal analyses for our case studies suggest that the Flickr dataset best reflects the NBN dataset when considering a purely spatial distribution with no time constraints. The best represented species on Flickr in comparison to NBN are diurnal garden birds as around 70% of the Flickr posts for them are valid observations relative to the NBN. Passive citizen science could offer a rich source of observation data for certain taxonomic groups, and/or as a repository for dedicated projects. Our novel method of validating Flickr records is suited to verifying more extensive collections, including less well-known species, and when used in combination with citizen science projects could offer a platform for accurate identification of species and their location."

Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed 2170 patients with ARF in Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Database III from 2001 to 2012. By drawing the receiver operating characteristic curve, LAR shows a better predictive value in predicting the 30-day mortality of ARF patients (AUC: 0.646), which is higher than that of albumin (AUC: 0.631) or lactate (AUC: 0.616) alone, and even higher than SOFA score(AUC: 0.642).

These host proteases activate the spike protein and enable SARS-CoV-2 entry. We herein performed genomic-guided gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify upstream regulatory elements altering the expression of TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L. Further, medicinal compounds were identified based on their effects on gene expression signatures of the modulators of TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L genes. Using this strategy, estradiol and retinoic acid have been identified as putative SARS-CoV-2 alleviation agents. Next, we analyzed drug-gene and gene-gene interaction networks using 809 human targets of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The network results indicate that estradiol interacts with 370 (45%) and retinoic acid interacts with 251 (31%) human proteins. Interestingly, a combination of estradiol and retinoic acid interacts with 461 (56%) of human proteins, indicating the therapeutic benefits of drug combination therapy. Finally, molecular docking analysis suggests that both the drugs bind to TMPRSS2 and CTSL with the nanomolar to low micromolar affinity. The results suggest that these drugs can simultaneously target both the entry pathways of SARS-CoV-2 and thus can be considered as a potential treatment option for COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3194036877,"Social interactions routinely lead to neural activity in a ""social brain network"" comprising, among other regions, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). But what is the function of these areas? Are they specialized for behavior in social contexts or do they implement computations required for dealing with any reactive process, even non-living entities? Here, we use fMRI and a game paradigm separating the need for these two aspects of cognition. We find that most social-brain areas respond to both social and non-social reactivity rather than just to human opponents. However, the TPJ shows a dissociation from the dmPFC: its activity and connectivity primarily reflect context-dependent outcome processing and reactivity detection, while dmPFC engagement is linked to implementation of a behavioral strategy. Our results characterize an overarching computational property of the social brain but also suggest specialized roles for subregions of this network."
https://openalex.org/W3193941422,"China's announcement of its goal of carbon neutrality has increased the practical significance of research on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that result from urbanization. With a comprehensive consideration of population migration in China, this study examines the impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions based on provincial panel data from 2000 to 2012. Two indicators (resident population and household registration population) are used to measure urbanization rate. The results reveal that the impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions in China is closely correlated with the structure of urban resident population and interregional population migration. The estimation results are still robust by using generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator and two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator. The proportion of temporary residents is introduced as a proxy variable for population migration. The panel threshold model regression results show that the proportion of temporary residents has a marginal effect on the relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions. In regions with a higher proportion of temporary residents, the positive effects of resident population urbanization on CO2 emissions tend to be weaker. These findings are consistent with the theories of ecological modernization and urban environmental transition. This paper makes suggestions on China's urbanization development model and countermeasures are proposed to minimize the CO2 emissions caused by urbanization."

Suppression events were based on a previous survey of public health academics. Participants answered questions concerning seven suppression events in their efforts to report the trial, e.g., [I was…] ""asked to suppress certain findings as they were viewed as being unfavourable."" We also examined the association between information on study funder, geographical location, targeted health behaviour, country democracy rating and age of publication with reported suppression.We received responses from 104 authors (50%) of 208 eligible trials, from North America (34%), Europe (33%), Oceania (17%), and other countries (16%). Eighteen percent reported at least one of the seven suppression events relating to the trial in question.

https://openalex.org/W3195208411,"Soil enzymes mediate key processes and functions of the soils, such as organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Here, we studied the activity of five extracellular soil enzymes involved in the C, N, and P-mineralizing process in both litter and surface soil layer of rainforest in the northwest region of the Colombian Amazon and the response of those soil enzymes to land use change. The experimental study design included six study sites for comparing long-term pasture systems to native forest and regeneration practices after pasture, within the main landscapes of the region, mountain and hill landscapes separately. Results showed considerable enzymatic activity in the litter layer of the forest, highlighting the vital role of this compartment in the nutrient cycling of low fertility soils from tropical regions. With the land use transition to pastures, changes in soil enzymatic activities were driven by the management of pastures, with SOC and N losses and reduced absolute activity of soil enzymes in long-term pastures under continuous grazing (25 years). However, the enzyme activities expressed per unit of SOC did not show changes in C and N-acquiring enzymes, suggesting a higher mineralization potential in pastures. Enzymatic stoichiometry analysis indicated a microbial P limitation that could lead to a high catabolic activity with a potential increase in the use of SOC by microbial communities in the search for P, thus affecting soil C sequestration, soil quality and the provision of soil-related ecosystem services."
https://openalex.org/W3195292176,"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) originates from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection due to the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway to maintain proliferation and survival. An important mechanism of the activated NF-κB signaling pathway in ATLL is the activation of the macroautophagy (herafter referred to as autophagy in the remainder of this manuscript)-lysosomal degradation of p47 (NSFL1C), a negative regulator of the NF-κB pathway. Therefore, we considered the use of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (CQ/HCQ) as an autophagy inhibitor to treat ATLL; these drugs were originally approved by the FDA as antimalarial drugs and have recently been used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this paper, we determined the therapeutic efficacy of CQ/HCQ, as NF-κB inhibitors, in ATLL mediated by blockade of p47 degradation. Administration of CQ/HCQ to ATLL cell lines and primary ATLL cells induced cell growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner, and the majority of cells underwent apoptosis after CQ administration. As to the molecular mechanism, autophagy was inhibited in CQ-treated ATLL cells, and activation of the NF-κB pathway was suppressed with the restoration of the p47 level. When the antitumor effect of CQ/HCQ was examined using immunodeficient mice transplanted with ATLL cell lines, CQ/HCQ significantly suppressed tumor growth and improved the survival rate in the ATLL xenograft mouse model. Importantly, HCQ selectively induced ATLL cell death in the ATLL xenograft mouse model at the dose used to treat SLE. Taken together, our results suggest that the inhibition of autophagy by CQ/HCQ may become a novel and effective strategy for the treatment of ATLL."
https://openalex.org/W3192904328,"Large mammalian herbivores use a diverse array of strategies to survive predator encounters including flight, grouping, vigilance, warning signals, and fitness indicators. While anti-predator strategies appear to be driven by specific predator traits, no prior studies have rigorously evaluated whether predator hunting characteristics predict reactive anti-predator responses. We experimentally investigated behavioral decisions made by free-ranging impala, wildebeest, and zebra during encounters with model predators with different functional traits. We hypothesized that the choice of response would be driven by a predator's hunting style (i.e., ambush vs. coursing) while the intensity at which the behavior was performed would correlate with predator traits that contribute to the prey's relative risk (i.e., each predator's prey preference, prey-specific capture success, and local predator density). We found that the choice and intensity of anti-predator behaviors were both shaped by hunting style and relative risk factors. All prey species directed longer periods of vigilance towards predators with higher capture success. The decision to flee was the only behavior choice driven by predator characteristics (capture success and hunting style) while intensity of vigilance, frequency of alarm-calling, and flight latency were modulated based on predator hunting strategy and relative risk level. Impala regulated only the intensity of their behaviors, while zebra and wildebeest changed both type and intensity of response based on predator traits. Zebra and impala reacted to multiple components of predation threat, while wildebeest responded solely to capture success. Overall, our findings suggest that certain behaviors potentially facilitate survival under specific contexts and that prey responses may reflect the perceived level of predation risk, suggesting that adaptive functions to reactive anti-predator behaviors may reflect potential trade-offs to their use. The strong influence of prey species identity and social and environmental context suggest that these factors may interact with predator traits to determine the optimal response to immediate predation threat."
https://openalex.org/W3193632471,"Monitoring variables such as dissolved oxygen, pH, and pond temperature is a key aspect of high-quality fish farming. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been proposed to model the dynamics of such variables to improve the fish farmer's decision-making. Most of the research on ML in aquaculture has focused on scenarios where devices for real-time data acquisition, storage, and remote monitoring are available, making it easy to develop accurate ML techniques. However, fish farmers do not necessarily have access to such devices. Many of them prefer to use equipment to manually measure these variables limiting the amount of available data to process. In this work, we study the use of random forests, multivariate linear regression, and artificial neural networks in scenarios with limited amount of measurements to analyze data from water-quality variables that are commonly measured in fish farming. We propose a methodology to build models in two scenarios: i) estimation of unobserved variables based on the observed ones, and ii) forecasting when a low amount of data is available for training. We show that random forests can be used to forecast dissolved oxygen, pond temperature, pH, ammonia, and ammonium when the water pond variables are measured only twice per day. Moreover, we showed that these prediction models can be implemented on a mobile-based information system and run in an average smartphone that fish farmers can afford."
https://openalex.org/W3194482175,"The use of saliva for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 has shown to be a good alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), since it permits self-collection, avoids the exposure of healthy persons to infected patients, reduces waiting times, eliminates the need of personal protective equipment and is non-invasive. Yet current saliva testing is still expensive due to the need of specialized tubes containing buffers to stabilize the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 and inactivate the virus. These tubes are expensive and not always accessible in sufficient quantities. We now developed an alternative saliva testing method, using TRIzol for extraction, viral inactivation, and storage of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, combined with RT-qPCR, which was comparable in its performance to NPS. Paired saliva samples and NPS were taken from 15 asymptomatic healthcare workers and one patient with SARS-CoV-2. Further 13 patients with SARS-CoV-2 were only saliva-tested. All the tests were performed according to CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. Saliva (4 mL) was taken in sterile 50 mL tubes, 1.5 mL TRIzol were added and mixed. Our results show that 5 μL of saliva RNA extracted with TRIzol allow for an adequate detection of the virus in patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was equally sensitive to NPS in TRIzol. We conclude that saliva testing using TRIzol is a recommendable method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 since it has several advantages over currently used saliva tests: it can be done with normal sterile tubes, does not need cold-chain handling, is stable at room temperature, is non-invasive and less costly, making it more accessible for low-income countries. Cheaper saliva testing using TRIzol is especially relevant for low-income countries to optimize diagnosis and help define quarantine durations for families, healthcare workers, schools, and other public workplaces, thus decreasing infections and mortality caused by SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3196092533,"Several molecular phylogenetic studies of the mistletoe family Loranthaceae have been published such that now the general pattern of relationships among the genera and their biogeographic histories are understood. Less is known about species relationships in the larger (> 10 species) genera. This study examines the taxonomically difficult genus Taxillus composed of 35-40 Asian species. The goal was to explore the genetic diversity present in Taxillus plastomes, locate genetically variable hotspots, and test these for their utility as potential DNA barcodes. Using genome skimming, complete plastomes, as well as nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA sequences, were newly generated for eight species. The plastome sequences were used in conjunction with seven publicly available Taxillus sequences and three sequences of Scurrula, a close generic relative. The Taxillus plastomes ranged from 121 to 123 kbp and encoded 90-93 plastid genes. In addition to all of the NADH dehydrogenase complex genes, four ribosomal genes, infA and four intron-containing tRNA genes were lost or pseudogenized in all of the Taxillus and Scurrula plastomes. The topologies of the plastome, mitochondrial rDNA and nuclear rDNA trees were generally congruent, though with discordance at the position of T. chinensis. Several variable regions in the plastomes were identified that have sufficient numbers of parsimony informative sites as to recover the major clades seen in the complete plastome tree. Instead of generating complete plastome sequences, our study showed that accD alone or the concatenation of accD and rbcL can be used in future studies to facilitate identification of Taxillus samples and to generate a molecular phylogeny with robust sampling within the genus."

Through constructing the evaluation index system of the coupling and coordination development degree between sports industry and health service industry, using entropy evaluation method and coupling and coordination degree model, this paper explore the comprehensive level and coupling and coordination development status of sports industry and health service industry in thirty-one provinces, municipality cities and autonomous regions of China from 2013 to 2017. The results of this paper show that the comprehensive China's sports industry and health service industry both present an incremental development trend year by year, and are characterized by the distribution of ""high in the east and low in the west"" in space. The government's policy support provides superior industrial supporting conditions for the development of sports industry. However, it is not conducive to the promotion of industrial economic benefits. In the health service industry, the rapid development of health insurance is beneficial to the integration of industrial resources and the perfection of industrial chain. Whereas as the core content of health service industry, health service has greater space for development; the coupling and coordination degree between the two industries rises from mild maladjustment to basic coordination, which is characterized by the distribution of ""high in the east and low in the west"" in space; among provinces, with Beijing, the Yangtze River Delta and Guangdong as the three development center points, it shows the spatial evolutionary process from ""dispersion-type plaques"" to ""gathering type scattered surfaces""."

The empirical test shows that the accuracy was 95%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.872. 2) The seven types of manufacturing industries including the pulp and paper (PP) industry, metallurgical chemical (MC) industry, pharmaceutical manufacturing (PM) industry, machinery and electronics (ME) industry, wood furniture (WF) industry, textile clothing (TC) industry, and agricultural and food product processing (AF) industry are drawn through a 1 km× 1km projection grid. The evolution map of the spatial pattern and the density field hotspots are also drawn. 3) After analyzing the driving forces of the changes in the number of manufacturing industries mentioned above, we found that manufacturing base, distance from town, population, GDP per capita, distance from the railway station were the significant driving factors of changes in the manufacturing industries mentioned above. The results of this research can help guide the development of manufacturing industries, maximize the advantages of regional factors and conditions, and provide insight into how the spatial layout of the manufacturing industry could be optimized."
https://openalex.org/W3193393597,"In females, estrogens have two main modes of action relating to gonadotropin secretion: positive feedback and negative feedback. Estrogen positive and negative feedback are controlled by different regions of the hypothalamus: the preoptic area/anterior portion (mainly the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, AVPV) of the hypothalamus is associated with estrogen positive feedback while the mediobasal hypothalamus (mainly the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, ARH), is associated with estrogen negative feedback. In this study, we examined the temporal pattern of gene transcription in these two regions following estrogen treatment. Adult, ovariectomized, Long Evans rats received doses of estradiol benzoate (EB) or oil every 4 days for 3 cycles. On the last EB priming cycle, hypothalamic tissues were dissected into the AVPV+ and ARH+ at 0 hrs (baseline/oil control), 6 hrs, or 24 hrs after EB treatment. RNA was extracted and sequenced using bulk RNA sequencing. Differential gene analysis, gene ontology, and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed. Overall, we found that the AVPV+ and ARH+ respond differently to estradiol stimulation. In both regions, estradiol treatment resulted in more gene up-regulation than down-regulation. S100g was very strongly up-regulated by estradiol in both regions at 6 and 24 hrs after EB treatment. In the AVPV+ the highest number of differentially expressed genes occurred 24 hrs after EB. In the ARH+, the highest number of genes differentially expressed by EB occurred between 6 and 24 hrs after EB, while in the AVPV+, the fewest genes changed their expression between these time points, demonstrating a temporal difference in the way that EB regulates transcription these two areas. Several genes strongly implicated in gonadotropin release were differentially affected by estradiol including Esr1, encoding estrogen receptor-α and Kiss1, encoding kisspeptin. As an internal validation, Kiss1 was up-regulated in the AVPV+ and down-regulated in the ARH+. Gene network analysis revealed the vastly different clustering of genes modulated by estradiol in the AVPV+ compared with the ARH+. These results indicate that gene expression in these two hypothalamic regions have specific responses to estradiol in timing and direction."
https://openalex.org/W3193640466,"Identifying the historical processes that drive microhabitat transitions across deep time is of great interest to evolutionary biologists. Morphological variation can often reveal such mechanisms, but in clades with high microhabitat diversity and no concomitant morphological specialization, the factors influencing animal transitions across microhabitats are more difficult to identify. Lungless salamanders (family: Plethodontidae) have transitioned into and out of the arboreal microhabitat many times throughout their evolutionary history without substantial morphological specialization. In this study, we explore the relationship between microhabitat use and broad-scale climatic patterns across species’ ranges to test the role of climate in determining the availability of the arboreal microhabitat. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we reveal that arboreal species live in warmer, lower elevation regions than terrestrial species. We also employ ecological niche modeling as a complementary approach, quantifying species-level pairwise comparisons of niche overlap. The results of this approach demonstrate that arboreal species on average display more niche overlap with other arboreal species than with terrestrial species after accounting for non-independence of niche model pairs caused by geographic and phylogenetic distances. Our results suggest that occupation of the arboreal microhabitat by salamanders may only be possible in sufficiently warm, low elevation conditions. More broadly, this study indicates that the impact of micro-environmental conditions on temporary microhabitat use, as demonstrated by small-scale ecological studies, may scale up dramatically to shape macroevolutionary patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3193675876,"Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that uses felids as definitive hosts and warm-blooded animals as intermediate hosts. While the dispersal of T. gondii infectious oocysts from land to coastal waters has been well documented, transmission routes to pelagic species remain puzzling. We used the modified agglutination test (MAT titre ≥ 10) to detect antibodies against T. gondii in sera collected from 1014 pelagic seabirds belonging to 10 species. Sampling was carried out on eight islands of the Western Indian Ocean: Reunion and Juan de Nova (colonized by cats), Cousin, Cousine, Aride, Bird, Europa and Tromelin islands (cat-free). Antibodies against T. gondii were found in all islands and all species but the great frigatebird. The overall seroprevalence was 16.8% [95% CI: 14.5%-19.1%] but significantly varied according to species, islands and age-classes. The low antibody levels (MAT titres = 10 or 25) detected in one shearwater and three red-footed booby chicks most likely resulted from maternal antibody transfer. In adults, exposure to soils contaminated by locally deposited oocysts may explain the detection of antibodies in both wedge-tailed shearwaters on Reunion Island and sooty terns on Juan de Nova. However, 144 adults breeding on cat-free islands also tested positive. In the Seychelles, there was a significant decrease in T. gondii prevalence associated with greater distances to cat populations for species that sometimes rest on the shore, i.e. terns and noddies. This suggests that oocysts carried by marine currents could be deposited on shore tens of kilometres from their initial deposition point and that the number of deposited oocysts decreases with distance from the nearest cat population. The consumption of fishes from the families Mullidae, Carangidae, Clupeidae and Engraulidae, previously described as T. gondii oocyst-carriers (i.e. paratenic hosts), could also explain the exposure of terns, noddies, boobies and tropicbirds to T. gondii. Our detection of antibodies against T. gondii in seabirds that fish in the high sea, have no contact with locally contaminated soils but frequent the shores and/or consume paratenic hosts supports the hypothesis of an open-sea dispersal of T. gondii oocysts by oceanic currents and/or fish."
https://openalex.org/W3193903083,"Research indicates that increasing diversity in doctoral programs can positively affect students’ academic success. However, little research examines students’ responses to female scholars’ representation. The two studies presented here examine how students’ exposure to female academic role models shapes students’ attitudes toward their own academic success (i.e. self-efficacy). Such attitudes are critical because they predict student retention rates. In our first study, we randomly exposed 297 Ph.D. students in one academic discipline to either a gender-diverse (i.e. 30% female authors) or non-diverse syllabus in research methods (i.e. 10% female authors). We examined the effect of the intervention on students’ perceived likelihood of succeeding in the hypothetical course. Contrary to expectations derived from the literature, we found that increasing women’s representation in syllabi did not affect female students’ self-efficacy. Rather, male students expressed lower self-efficacy when evaluating the more gender-diverse syllabus. We also found that students’ attitudes toward diversity in academia predicted their reactions more strongly than did their own gender: gender-diverse syllabi reduced self-efficacy among those students unsupportive of diversity. In our second study, we analyzed non-interventional survey questions to examine the relationship between female role models and long-term academic self-efficacy. Analysis was observational and thus did not assess causality. We found that students with more role models have higher academic self-efficacy, irrespective of student and role model gender. Nonetheless, results also suggested that some students actively seek female role models: namely, female students, and particularly those valuing diversity. Our results ultimately suggest that exposure to female role models relates in surprising ways to Ph.D. students’ self-efficacy. Having more female role models correlates with greater expectations of academic success among certain groups of students, but with diminished expectations of academic success among other groups."
https://openalex.org/W3195188297,"Post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading direct cause of maternal mortality in India. Uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) is recommended for atonic PPH cases not responding to uterotonics. This study assessed cost-effectiveness of three UBT devices used in Indian public health settings.A decision tree model was built to assess cost-effectiveness of Bakri-UBT and low-cost ESM-UBT alternatives as compared to the recommended standard of care i.e. condom-UBT intervention. A hypothetical annual cohort of women eligible for UBT intervention after experiencing atonic PPH in Indian public health facilities were evaluated for associated costs and outcomes over life-time horizon using a disaggregated societal perspective. Costs by undertaking primary costing and clinical parameters from published literature were used. Incremental cost per Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) averted, number of surgeries and maternal deaths with the interventions were estimated. An India specific willingness to pay threshold of INR 24,211 (USD 375) was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness. Detailed sensitivity analysis and expected value of information analysis was undertaken.ESM-UBT at base-case Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of INR -2,412 (USD 37) per DALY averted is a cost-saving intervention i.e. is less expensive and more effective as compared to condom-UBT. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis however shows an error probability of 0.36, indicating a degree of uncertainty around model results. Bakri-UBT at an ICER value of INR -126,219 (USD -1,957) per DALY averted incurs higher incremental societal costs and is less effective as compared to condom-UBT. Hence, Bakri-UBT is not cost-effective.For atonic PPH management in India, condom-UBT offers better value as compared to Bakri-UBT. Given the limited clinical effectiveness evidence and uncertainty in sensitivity analysis, cost-saving result for ESM-UBT must be considered with caution. Future research may focus on generating high quality comparative clinical evidence for UBT devices to facilitate policy decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3194259952,"Background Microbial keratitis (MK) is the most common non-surgical ophthalmic emergency, and can rapidly progress, causing irreversible sight-loss. This study explored whether the COVID-19 (C19) national lockdown impacted upon the clinical presentation and outcomes of MK at a UK tertiary-care centre. Methods Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for all patients with presumed MK requiring corneal scrapes, presenting between 23 rd March and 30 th June in 2020 (Y2020), and the equivalent time windows in 2017, 2018 and 2019 (pre-C19). Results In total, 181 and 49 patients presented during the pre-C19 and Y2020 periods, respectively. In Y2020, concurrent ocular trauma (16.3% vs. 5.5%, p = 0.030) and immunosuppression use (12.2% vs 1.7%, p = 0.004) were more prevalent. Despite proportionately fewer ward admissions during the pandemic (8.2% vs 32.6%, p&lt;0.001), no differences were observed in baseline demographics; presenting visual acuity (VA; median 0.6 vs 0.6 LogMAR, p = 0.785); ulcer area (4.0 vs 3.0mm 2 , p = 0.520); or final VA (0.30 vs 0.30 LogMAR, p = 0.990). Whilst the overall rates of culture positivity were similar in Y2020 and pre-C19 (49.0% vs. 54.7%, p = 0.520), there were differences in the cultures isolated, with a lower rate of poly-microbial cultures in Y2020 (8.3% vs. 31.3%, p = 0.022). Conclusions Patient characteristics, MK severity and final visual outcomes did not appear to be affected in the first UK lockdown, despite fewer patients being admitted for care. Concurrent trauma and systemic immunosuppression use were greater than in previous years. The difference in spectra of isolated organisms may relate to behavioural changes, such as increased hand hygiene."
https://openalex.org/W3194362191,"Natural resources are scarce in the Loess Plateau, and the ecological environment is fragile. Sustainable development requires special attention to resource and environmental carrying capacity (RECC). This study selected 24 representative cities in five natural areas of the Loess Plateau; used the entropy-weight-based TOPSIS method to evaluate and analyze the RECC of each city and region from 2013 to 2018; established a diagnosis model to identify the obstacle factors restricting the improvement of RECC; and constructed the theoretical framework of the RECC system mechanism. The results show that the RECC of the Loess Plateau is increasing in general but is relatively small. The environmental and social subsystems have the highest and lowest carrying capacities, respectively. There is an evident contradiction between economic development and the environment. Population density, investment in technological innovation, per capita sown area, and per capita water resources are the main obstacles affecting the improvement of RECC in the Loess Plateau. Such evaluations and diagnoses can support ecological civilization and sustainable development."
https://openalex.org/W3194372420,"Change-of-direction (CoD) ability is an important determinant of athletic performance. Muscle strength is among the most important determinants of CoD ability. However, previous studies investigating the relationship between CoD ability and muscle strength focused mostly on flexor and extensor muscle groups, or used multi-joint exercises, such as jumps, squats or mid-thigh pull. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between CoD ability and strength of ankle, knee, hip and trunk maximal and explosive strength. The participants (n = 327), consisting of male and female basketball players, tennis players and long-distance runners completed isometric strength assessments and CoD testing (90° and 180° turn tests). The times of both CoD tests were associated with muscle strength (peak torques and the rate of torque development variables), with correlation coefficients being mostly weak to moderate (r = 0.2-0.6). Strength variables explained 33%, 62% and 48% of the variance in the 90° turn task, and 42%, 36% and 59% of the variance in the 180° turn task, in basketball players, long-distance runners and tennis players, respectively. Hip and trunk muscle strength variables were the most prevalent in the regression models, especially hip adduction and abduction strength. Our results suggest that the strength of several lower limb muscles, in particular of the hip abductors and adductors, and trunk muscles, but also hip rotators, extensors and flexors, as well as knee and ankle flexors and extensors should be considered when aiming to improve CoD performance."
https://openalex.org/W3194831968,"The correct communication of the severity of violence is essential in the context of legal trials, custody cases, support of victims, etc., for providing fair treatment. A narrator that communicates their experiences of interpersonal violence may rate the seriousness of the incident differently than a rater reading the narrator's text, suggesting that there exist perceptual differences (PD) in severity ratings between the narrator and the rater. We propose that these perceptual differences may depend on whether the narrative is based on physical or psychological violence, and on gender differences. Physical violence may be evaluated as more serious by the receiver of the narrative than by the narrator (Calibration PD), whereas the seriousness of psychological violence may be difficult to convey, leading to a discrepancy in the seriousness ratings between the narrator and the rater (Accuracy PD). In addition, gender stereotypes may influence the seriousness rating (Gender PD), resulting in violence against women being perceived as more serious than the same violence against men. These perceptual differences were investigated in 3 phases using a new experimental procedure. In Phase 1, 113 narrators provided descriptions and seriousness ratings of self-experienced physical and psychological violence in relationships. In Phase 2, 340 independent raters rated the seriousness of 10 randomly selected narrations from Phase 1. In Phase 3, the genders in the narrations were changed to the opposite gender, and seriousness ratings were collected from 340 different raters. Our results confirmed the hypothesized perceptual differences. Violence to male victims was considerably more likely to be seen as severe when the raters were misled to believe the victim was a woman. We propose that these data provide practical guidelines for how to deal with misinformation in the communication of violence. The data also show that mean values and the confidence of such severity ratings need to be adjusted for several factors, such as whether it is self-experienced or communicated, the type of violence, and the gender of the victims and raters."
https://openalex.org/W3196180298,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an important infectious cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, with significant morbidity and mortality. Current diagnostic algorithms are based on identifying toxin by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and toxin gene by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in patients with diarrhea. EIA's sensitivity is poor, and PCR, although highly sensitive and specific, cannot differentiate infection from colonization. An ideal test that incorporates microbial factors, host factors, and host-microbe interaction might characterize true infection, and assess prognosis and recurrence. The study of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has the potential to be an ideal diagnostic test. The presence of VOCs accounts for the characteristic odor of stool in CDI but their presence in breath and plasma has not been studied yet. A cross-sectional proof-of-concept study analyzing VOCs using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) was done on breath, stool, and plasma of patients with clinical features and positive PCR for CDI (cases) and compared with patients with clinical features but a negative PCR (control). Our results showed that VOC patterns in breath, stool, and plasma, had good accuracy [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 93%, 86%, and 91%, respectively] for identifying patients with CDI."
https://openalex.org/W3196269472,"To expand the knowledge on the tempo-spatial patterns of zooplankton and the key modulated factors in urban aquatic ecosystem, we investigated zooplankton and water quality from April 2018 to January 2019 in the hinterland of the Three Gorges Reservoir area, Wanzhou City of China. The results indicated that water quality indicated by the trophic state index (TSI) reached a state of mesotrophication to light eutrophication in the Yangtze River, and a state of moderate- to hyper- eutrophication in its tributaries. Based on the biomass of zooplanktons, Asplanchna priodonta was the most common specie in April; Encentrum sp., Filinia cornuta and Epiphanes senta were the most noticeable species in summer; Cyclopoida Copepodid, Sinocalanus dorrii and Philodina erythrophthalma became the dominant species in winter. Generally, rotifers prevailed in April and August, and copepods became the most popular in January. According to canonical correspondence analysis, nitrate, temperature (T), ammonia, water level and permanganate index (CODMn) significantly influenced the community structure of zooplankton (p < 0.05). The dominant species shifts of zooplankton were partly associated with nutrient level (nitrate and ammonia) under periodic water level fluctuations. Rotifers and protozoans were characterized as high T adapted and CODMn-tolerant species comparing with cladocerans and copepods. The ratio of microzooplankton to mesozooplankton (Pmicro/meso) has presented a strongly positive relationship with T (p < 0.001), as well as Pmicro/meso and CODMn (p < 0.001). It implied that zooplankton tended to miniaturize individual size via species shift under high T and/or CODMn conditions induced by global warming and human activities. The information hints us that climate change and human activities are likely to produce fundamental changes in urban aquatic ecosystem by reorganizing biomass structure of the food web in future."

https://openalex.org/W3194068958,"The most unexpected and toughest phenomenon that has occurred in recent times is the global COVID-19 pandemic. One of the first measures to prevent the spread of the disease was to close educational institutions. The students were forced to start a learning process through social networks and web platforms. In some countries, a return to face-to-face classes was established. However, weeks later, some of them had to return to virtual activities due to an upswing in the COVID-19 cases. In Mexico, classes have been held virtually, with face-to-face activities only re-established in two of the 32 states. In our state, Yucatan, scholarly activities are still virtual. In this work, the dispersion of COVID-19 at different academic establishments in Yucatan was simulated. Networks of Friendship, noncordial treatment, family ties and study groups were considered. Based on these networks, we evaluated the possibility of returning to school without inducing a rebound in the COVID-19 cases in the state. Agent-based simulations were used, with each student as an agent. Interaction rules were established based on international research regarding good practices in times of COVID-19. We used seven networks from different academic institutions, ranging from primary through college level. As a result, possible contagion curves were obtained for different scenarios, which leads to a discussion about the measures that would be relevant once a return to face-to-face classes is overseen. Simulations show that isolating students and reducing the number of students in the same classroom are good strategies and substantially reduce the possible contagiousness."

https://openalex.org/W3195089561,"Understanding larval duration and hence dispersal potential of the European oyster Ostrea edulis is crucial to inform restoration strategies. Laval duration has an obligatory period of maturity to pediveliger (when larvae are ready to settle), but also an unknown period until metamorphosis is triggered by a settlement cue. The extent to which larvae can prolong the pediveliger period and delay metamorphosis has not been studied. Here we show that O. edulis larvae can delay metamorphosis for a period of 11 days, while retaining the capability to settle in high proportions when presented with a suitable settlement cue. O. edulis larvae are likely to be able to delay metamorphosis even further, since 80% of larvae in the control treatment were still alive when the experiment was terminated at day 14. The results indicate the ability of O. edulis larvae to more than double pelagic duration and probably further delay metamorphosis. We discuss these findings in the context of larval mortality, and the importance of O. edulis' larval settlement requirements for dispersal potential, recruitment success and connectivity of restoration sites."
https://openalex.org/W3195173750,"We determined social and behavioral factors associated with virologic non-suppression among pregnant women receiving Option B+ antiretroviral treatment (ART). Baseline data was used from women in Mobile WAChX trial from 6 public maternal child health (MCH) clinics in Kenya. Virologic non-suppression was defined as HIV viral load (VL) ≥1000 copies/ml. Antiretroviral resistance testing was performed using oligonucleotide ligation (OLA) assay. ART adherence information, motivation and behavioral skills were assessed using Lifewindows IMB tool, depression using PHQ-9, and food insecurity with the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. Correlates of virologic non-suppression were assessed using Poisson regression. Among 470 pregnant women on ART ≥4 months, 57 (12.1%) had virologic non-suppression, of whom 65% had HIV drug resistance mutations. In univariate analyses, risk of virologic non-suppression was associated with moderate-to-severe food insecurity (RR 1.80 [95% CI 1.06-3.05]), and varied significantly by clinic site (range 2%-22%, p <0.001). In contrast, disclosure (RR 0.36 [95% CI 0.17-0.78]) and having higher adherence skills (RR 0.70 [95% CI 0.58-0.85]) were associated with lower risk of virologic non-suppression. In multivariate analysis adjusting for clinic site, disclosure, depression symptoms, adherence behavior skills and food insecurity, disclosure and food insecurity remained associated with virologic non-suppression. Age, side-effects, social support, physical or emotional abuse, and distance were not associated with virologic non-suppression. Prevalence of virologic non-suppression among pregnant women on ART was appreciable and associated with food insecurity, disclosure and frequent drug resistance. HIV VL and resistance monitoring, and tailored counseling addressing food security and disclosure, may improve virologic suppression in pregnancy."

The nucleolar localization of PUF-A redistributes to the nucleoplasm upon the exposure to genotoxic agents in cells. However, little is known regarding the roles of PUF-A in tumor progression. Phosphoprotein database analysis revealed that Y259 phosphorylation of PUF-A is the most prevalent residue modified. Here, we reported the importance of PUF-A's phosphorylation on Y259 in tumorigenesis. PUF-A gene was knocked out by the Crispr/Cas9 method in human cervix epithelial HeLa cells. Loss of PUF-A in HeLa cells resulted in reduced clonogenic and lower transwell invasion capacity. Introduction of PUF-AY259F to PUF-A deficient HeLa cells was unable to restore colony formation. In addition, the unphosphorylated mutant of PUF-A, PUF-AY259F, attenuated PUF-A protein stability. Our results suggest the important role of Y259 phosphorylation of PUF-A in cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W3195848187,"This study aimed to investigate the structure of two deciduous forests and assess their above-ground carbon stock in order to promote community forest management (CFM) for REDD+ opportunities in the Ban Mae Chiang Rai Lum Community Forest in northern Thailand. A systematic sampling method was used to establish twenty-five sample plots of 40 m × 40 m (0.16 ha) each that were used to survey the entire 3,925 ha area of the community forest. Cluster analysis identified two different forest types: dry dipterocarp forest and mixed deciduous forest. It was determined that the above-ground carbon stock did not vary significantly between them. An analysis of carbon sequestration in the community forest indicates that carbon stock increased under CFM from 2007 to 2018 by an estimated 28,928 t C and participation in the carbon market would have yielded approximately US $339,730.43 or US $8.66 /ha/year to the community for that 10-year period. Projections for 2028 reflect that carbon stock will experience continual growth which indicates that maintaining CFM can increase carbon sequestration and reduce CO2 emissions. However, though further growth of carbon stock in the community forest is expected into 2038, that growth would be at a lesser rate than during the preceding decade. This suggests that CFM management should address forest utilization practices with a focus on maintaining long term carbon stock growth. Additional measures to address the impact of drought conditions and to safeguard against forest fires are required to sustain tree species' growth and expansion in order to increase their carbon accumulation potential. Thailand's community forest involvement in REDD+ and participation in its international carbon market could create more economic opportunities for local communities."
https://openalex.org/W3194298979,"Contract farming in seed production has played an instrumental role in bringing private investment into seed research and production. As developing countries have predominantly small and marginal farmers, the number of inefficiencies that arise from seed contractual agreements hinders producers from realizing the full potential benefits from seed contracts. We carried out an economic experiment with real producers and organizers currently engaged in seed production to analyze their preference for group seed contracts, its sustainability and welfare implications in the seed value chain. The producers are offered two types of group contracts: B and C. Contract B involves a company-organizer-seed producer group (SPG) whereas contract C removes the organizer and directly engages with the SPG (company → SPG). In the experiment, producers are asked to choose between an existing contract and either of the proposed group contracts. The experiment consists of two treatments: (i) concealed and revealed price information between agents, and (ii) presence and absence of a local organizer while making the decision. We find that the preference for group contract B is higher than for group contract C, suggesting the need for producers bargaining which can be achieved through group contract in the existing contract, Bargaining is high (6.3 percentage points) when price information is concealed. SPGs survive for about four out of five rounds and more than half of the groups (53%) formed in the first round survived throughout the five rounds, indicating a very high group sustainability."

There is a growing body of literature quantifying breeding season resource selection in bobwhite; however, winter information is particularly sparse despite it being a season of substantial mortality. Information regarding winter resource selection is necessary to quantify the extent to which resource requirements are driving population change. We modeled bobwhite fall and winter resource selection as a function of vegetation structure, composition, and management from traditionally (intensively) managed sites and remnant (extensively managed) grassland sites in southwest Missouri using multinomial logit discrete choice models in a Bayesian framework. We captured 158 bobwhite from 67 unique coveys and attached transmitters to 119 individuals. We created 671 choice sets comprised of 1 used location and 3 available locations. Bobwhite selected for locations which were closer to trees during the winter; the relative probability of selection decreased from 0.45 (85% Credible Interval [CRI]: 0.17–0.74) to 0.00 (85% CRI: 0.00–0.002) as distance to trees ranged from 0–313 m. The relative probability of selection increased from near 0 (85% CRI: 0.00–0.01) to 0.33 (85% CRI: 0.09–0.56) and from near 0 (85% CRI: 0.00–0.00) to 0.51 (85% CRI: 0.36–0.71) as visual obstruction increased from 0 to 100% during fall and winter, respectively. Bobwhite also selected locations with more woody stems; the relative probability of selection increased from near 0.00 (85% CRI: 0.00–0.002) to 0.30 (85% CRI: 0.17–0.46) and near 0.00 (85% CRI: 0.00–0.001) to 0.35 (85% CRI: 0.22–0.55) as stem count ranged from 0 to 1000 stems in fall and winter, respectively. The relative probability of selection also decreased from 0.35 (85% CRI: 0.20–0.54) to nearly 0 (85% CRI: 0.00–0.001) as percent grass varied from 0 to 100% in fall. We suggest that dense shrub cover in close proximity to native grasslands is an important component of fall and winter cover given bobwhite selection of shrub cover and previously reported survival benefits in fall and winter."
https://openalex.org/W3195202126,"Cardiac hypertrophy is the result of responses to various physiological or pathological stimuli. Recently, we showed that polycystin-1 participates in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy elicited by pressure overload and mechanical stress. Interestingly, polycystin-1 knockdown does not affect phenylephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, suggesting that the effects of polycystin-1 are stimulus-dependent. In this study, we aimed to identify the role of polycystin-1 in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling in cardiomyocytes. Polycystin-1 knockdown completely blunted IGF-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We then investigated the molecular mechanism underlying this result. We found that polycystin-1 silencing impaired the activation of the IGF-1 receptor, Akt, and ERK1/2 elicited by IGF-1. Remarkably, IGF-1-induced IGF-1 receptor, Akt, and ERK1/2 phosphorylations were restored when protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B was inhibited, suggesting that polycystin-1 knockdown deregulates this phosphatase in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibition also restored IGF-1-dependent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in polycystin-1-deficient cells. Our findings provide the first evidence that polycystin-1 regulates IGF-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through a mechanism involving protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B."
https://openalex.org/W3187532593,"Pharmaceuticals and their packaging have a significant negative impact on the environment providing a very strong argument for action on the part of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to engage with pro-environmental behaviours (PEBs) in their workplaces. The aims of this research were therefore to investigate in hospital pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, 1) factors affecting engagement with workplace PEBs, and 2) determine if legislated carbon reduction targets in the UK influenced workplace PEBs in the UK compared with Australia which does not have legislated carbon reduction targets. The environmentally responsible disposal of pharmaceutical waste was the PEB of interest in this study. A mixed methods research design was utilised and a conceptual model (key variables: environmental attitude, concern, and knowledge, and organisational factors) was developed to identify factors influencing workplace PEBs. Participants were from five hospitals in Queensland, Australia and five NHS hospitals in England, UK. There was no statistically significant difference in environmental attitude or concern between the two groups—most had a mid-environmental attitude score and low levels of environmental concern. Participants lacked knowledge of the issue and the link between the environment and public health. Both Australian and UK participants reported recycling packaging waste was not a priority in the hospital pharmacy workplace (even in hospitals with recycling capability) as hospitals focused on compliance with clinical (contaminated) and confidential waste streams. Environmental attitude, knowledge, and concern therefore appeared to be weak influences on intention to perform workplace PEBs with workplace social norms (compliance due to audits) appearing to be a significant mediator of action. The key difference between the cohorts was that UK pharmacists felt waste was not in the scope of their role, and therefore not their responsibility. This study identified that legislated carbon reduction targets did not influence hospital pharmacy workplace PEBs–neither cohort reported engaging significantly in workplace PEBs. UK Government and NHS sustainability policy did not appear to have disseminated to pharmacy department level of UK public hospitals to any great extent."
https://openalex.org/W3193827173,"Crohn's disease (CD) and Intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) are chronic inflammatory ulcero-constrictive intestinal diseases with similar phenotype. Although both are disease models of chronic inflammation and their clinical presentations, imaging, histological and endoscopic findings are very similar, yet their etiologies are diverse. Hence, we aimed to look at differences in the prevalence of pathobionts like adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica in CD and ITB as well as their associations with host-associated genetic polymorphisms in genes majorly involved in pathways of microbial handling and immune responses.The study cohort included 142 subjects (69 patients with CD, 32 with ITB and 41 controls). RT- PCR amplification was used to detect the presence of AIEC, L. monocytogenes, C. jejuni, and Y. enterocolitica DNA in colonic mucosal biopsies. Additionally, we tested three SNPs in IRGM (rs13361189, rs10065172, and rs4958847), one SNP in ATG16L1 (rs2241880) and one SNP in TNFRSF1A (rs4149570) by real-time PCR with SYBR green from peripheral blood samples in this cohort.In patients with CD, AIEC was most frequently present (16/ 69, 23.19%) followed by L. monocytogenes (14/69, 20.29%), C. jejuni (9/69, 13.04%), and Y. enterocolitica (7/69, 10.14%). Among them, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were significantly associated with CD (p = 0.02). In addition, we identified all the three SNPs in IRGM (rs13361189, rs10065172, and rs4958847), one SNP in ATG16L1 (rs2241880) and TNFRSF1A (rs4149570) with a significant difference in frequency in patients with CD compared with ITB and controls (p<0.05).Higher prevalence of host gene polymorphisms, as well as the presence of pathobionts, was seen in the colonic mucosa of patients with CD as compared to ITB, although both are disease models of chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4210390603,"Memorizing pheromonal locations is critical for many mammalian species as it involves finding mates and avoiding competitors. In rodents, pheromonal information is perceived by the main and accessory olfactory systems. However, the role of somatosensation in context-dependent learning and memorizing of pheromone locations remains unexplored. We addressed this problem by training female mice on a multimodal task to locate pheromones by sampling volatiles emanating from male urine through the orifices of varying dimensions or shapes that are sensed by their vibrissae. In this novel pheromone location assay, female mice' preference toward male urine scent decayed over time when they were permitted to explore pheromones vs neutral stimuli, water. On training them for the associations involving olfactory and whisker systems, it was established that they were able to memorize the location of opposite sex pheromones, when tested 15 days later. This memory was not formed either when the somatosensory inputs through whisker pad were blocked or when the pheromonal cues were replaced with that of same sex. The association between olfactory and somatosensory systems was further confirmed by the enhanced expression of the activity-regulated cytoskeleton protein. Furthermore, the activation of main olfactory bulb circuitry by pheromone volatiles did not cause any modulation in learning and memorizing non-pheromonal volatiles. Our study thus provides the evidence for associations formed between different sensory modalities facilitating the long-term memory formation relevant to social and reproductive behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3193975553,"Zimbabwe has made large strides in addressing HIV. To ensure a continued robust response, a clear understanding of costs associated with its HIV program is critical. We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation in 2017 to estimate the annual average patient cost for accessing Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT) services (through antenatal care) and Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) services in Zimbabwe. Twenty sites representing different types of public health facilities in Zimbabwe were included. Data on patient costs were collected through in-person interviews with 414 ART and 424 PMTCT adult patients and through telephone interviews with 38 ART and 47 PMTCT adult patients who had missed their last appointment. The mean and median annual patient costs were examined overall and by service type for all participants and for those who paid any cost. Potential patient costs related to time lost were calculated by multiplying the total time to access services (travel time, waiting time, and clinic visit duration) by potential earnings (US$75 per month assuming 8 hours per day and 5 days per week). Mean annual patient costs for accessing services for the participants was US$20.00 [standard deviation (SD) = US$80.42, median = US$6.00, range = US$0.00-US$12,18.00] for PMTCT and US$18.73 (SD = US$58.54, median = US$8.00, range = US$0.00-US$ 908.00) for ART patients. The mean annual direct medical costs for PMTCT and ART were US$9.78 (SD = US$78.58, median = US$0.00, range = US$0.00-US$ 90) and US$7.49 (SD = US$60.00, median = US$0.00) while mean annual direct non-medical cost for US$10.23 (SD = US$17.35, median = US$4.00) and US$11.23 (SD = US$25.22, median = US$6.00, range = US$0.00-US$ 360.00). The PMTCT and ART costs per visit based on time lost were US$3.53 (US$1.13 to US$8.69) and US$3.43 (US$1.14 to US$8.53), respectively. The mean annual patient costs per person for PMTCT and ART in this evaluation will impact household income since PMTCT and ART services in Zimbabwe are supposed to be free."
https://openalex.org/W3194584523,"Production landscapes play an important role in conserving biodiversity outside protected areas. Socio-ecological production landscapes (SEPL) are places where people use for primary production that conserve biodiversity. Such places can be found around the world, but a lack of geographic information on SEPL has resulted in their potential for conservation being neglected in policies and programs. We tested the global applicability of the Satoyama Index for identifying SEPL in multi-use cultural landscapes using global land use/cover data and two datasets of known SEPL. We found that the Satoyama Index, which was developed with a focus on biodiversity and tested in Japan, could be used globally to identify landscapes resulting from complex interactions between people and nature with statistical significance. This makes SEPL more relevant in the global conservation discourse. As the Satoyama Index mapping revealed that approximately 80% of SEPL occur outside recognized conservation priorities, such as protected areas and key biodiversity areas, identifying SEPL under the scheme of other area-based conservation measures (OECM) may bring more conservation attention to SEPL. Based on the issues identified in the SEPL mapping, we discuss ways that could improve the Satoyama Index mapping at global scale with the longitudinal temporal dimension and at more local scale with spatial and thematic resolution."
https://openalex.org/W3195259359,"Sampling rare and clustered populations is challenging because of the effort required to find rare units. Heuristically, a practitioner would prefer to discontinue sampling in areas where rare units of interest are apparently extremely sparse or absent. We take advantage of the characteristics of inverse sampling to adaptively inform practitioners when it is efficient to move on to sample new areas. We introduce Adaptive Two-stage Inverse Sampling (ATIS), which is designed to leave a selected area after observation of an a priori number of only non-rare units and to continue sampling in the area when rare units are observed. ATIS is efficient in many cases and yields more rare units than conventional sampling for a rare and clustered population. We derive unbiased estimators of population total and variance. We also introduce an easy-to-compute estimator, which is nearly as efficient as the unbiased estimator. A simulation study on a rare plant population of buttercups ( Ranunculus ) shows that ATIS even with the easy-to-compute estimator is more efficient than its conventional sampling counterparts and is more efficient than Two-stage Adaptive Cluster Sampling (TACS) for small and moderate final sample sizes. Additional simulations reveal that ATIS is efficient for binary data (e.g., presence or absence) whereas TACS is inefficient for binary data. The overall results indicate that ATIS is consistently efficient compared to conventional sampling and to adaptive cluster sampling in some important cases."

We adopted unbalanced panel data on Chinese listed companies from 2007 to 2018. Empirical research shows that there are significant differences in the impact of venture capital on the growth performance of family enterprises and non-family enterprises. Venture capital negatively affects the growth performance of family enterprises, while the negative impact of venture capital on family enterprises is not significant. In addition, family control positively moderates the negative impact of venture capital on family enterprise growth performance."
https://openalex.org/W3196131584,"Subcontractors depend heavily on their prime contractor and thus find it very risky to enter a new business on their own. This study proposes a framework for these subcontractors to develop blue ocean technologies related to their prime contractor. First, the primary technologies predicted to be promising are extracted from the business reports of the prime contractor. Sub-technologies are then selected through a patent-based search using keywords and International Patent Classification codes of the primary technologies. From them, blue ocean technologies are proposed by optimizing the weighted mean of the min-max normalized market value, degree of competition in the technology market, and subcontractors' potential technological capabilities for each sub-technology. This study shows that subcontractors can enhance their technology competitiveness by finding a low-risk blue ocean technology. Our empirical research on the subcontractors of a semiconductor firm identified technological patent fields for them to pursue. From our framework, subcontractors can identify blue ocean technologies by considering their prime contractor's future industrial areas and technologies of interest as well as their own technological capabilities. Furthermore, the prime contractors can gain the synergy effect of technology expansion through cooperation."
