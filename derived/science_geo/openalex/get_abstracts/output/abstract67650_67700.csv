https://openalex.org/W1539795437,"Abstract The procedures used in the collection and analysis of x-ray diffraction data from single crystals of ribonuclease-S are described. Both isomorphous and anomalous scattering were measured on heavy atom derivatives prepared with the uranyl cation, the tetracyanoplatinate(II) anion, and dichloroethylenediamine platinum(II). The amplitudes and phases of 6000 reflections were established. An electron density map with an estimated root mean square error of 0.23 electron per (A)3 and a nominal resolution of 2 A was produced. An interpretation of this map on the basis of the known chemical sequence has been made. The actual fit of the physical model to the map is shown in a series of stereophotographs of superimposed images. A preliminary list of the coordinates of all nonhydrogen atoms in this enzyme has been prepared. The level of confidence in the proposed structure varies markedly in different parts of the protein. Comments on the quality of the electron density map at individual residues and on the fit of the model in the different regions are given."

Similar condensation reactions occurred in cow adrenal glands perfused with dilute aldehyde solutions at 37 degrees C. Biosynthesis of these alkaloids in vivo could play a role in altering an individual's behavior during and after the ingestion of alcohol."
https://openalex.org/W1575357160,"Abstract Rabbit antisera have been prepared against three yeasts (Kloeckera brevis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Saccharomyces lactis) whose mannans have closely related but unique structures. All three antisera cross-react with the isolated mannans of the three yeasts, and the immunochemical bases for these cross-reactions were determined by a study of the inhibition of the precipitin reactions with oligosaccharides obtained from the mannans by acetolysis. The immunodominant side chain of the S. cerevisiae mannan is thought to be the tetrasaccharide unit M1 → 3M1 → 2M1 → 2M, since this oligosaccharide was the most effective inhibitor of the homologous precipitin reaction. While the S. lactis mannan contained this side chain, it also contained a pentasaccharide side chain of undetermined structure which was the immunodominant group of this mannan. The antiserum against the S. lactis mannan contained at least two antibody specificities, one against the tetrasaccharide side chain and the other against the pentasaccharide side chain. This antiserum could be made specific for the pentasaccharide side chain by absorption with S. cerevisiae mannan."

https://openalex.org/W1526692287,"Abstract The interaction of bilirubin at concentrations less than 25 µm with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in aqueous solutions ranging from pH 3.5 to 8.6 was studied at room temperature by using the methods of optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) and absorption spectrophotometry between 230 and 600 mµ. The binding of bilirubin by BSA at pH 5 caused a red shift of an absorption maximum from about 440 to 457 mµ, the latter having a millimolar extinction coefficient of 58. This bilirubin-BSA complex exhibited probably the largest Cotton effect ever reported in the visible region, with an amplitude of approximately 1.5 x 106 degrees·cm2·decimole-1, expressed as molar rotation of bilirubin (protein rotations were deducted), with a peak at 435 mµ and a trough at 485 to 487 mµ. In addition, relatively smaller anomalous rotations were observed in the region between 250 and 400 mµ. The ORD behavior of the bilirubin-BSA complex was dependent upon the pH and buffer in the system. The amplitude of the main Cotton effect decreased greatly at either side of pH 5, with significant changes in the absorption spectra. At pH 5, low concentrations of sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer (0.2 mm ionic strength) decreased the amplitude to about one-tenth of that observed in the absence of acetate buffer when the order of addition was: bilirubin, buffer, and finally excess BSA. Sodium chloride, 50 mm, added last did not affect the ORD profile at pH 5 in the presence of excess BSA; however, at pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer added last reduced the Cotton effect significantly. ORD as well as spectrophotometric titrations gave a molar ratio of unity for the bilirubin-BSA complex at both pH 5 and 7.4. At pH 5 and 25° ± 2°, the apparent association (binding) constant was estimated to be (5.7 ± 1.5) x 106 m-1. The remarkably large Cotton effects observed at pH 5 were interpreted by the formation of a dissymmetric conformation of the bilirubin molecule upon binding to BSA in a specific manner which would permit dipole-dipole coupling between the juxtaposed dipyrrylmethene chromophores. This conformation was considered to be modified by pH, through changes in the ionization of binding groups and by changes in the protein conformation with pH, occurring in particular below about pH 4. The extrinsic effect of the asymmetric protein environment was also considered to be a factor in contributing to the observed anomalous rotations."

https://openalex.org/W1549958213,"Abstract Reduced, S-aminoethylated porcine ribonuclease was subjected to tryptic hydrolysis. A sequence of fractionation steps that included gel filtration and chromatography over SE-Sephadex C-50, Dowex 50-X2, and Dowex 1-X2 afforded a series of glycopeptide fractions which were recognized to derive from three separate regions of the molecule. Heterogeneity of the attached polysaccharide chains precluded the isolation of glycopeptides homogeneous with respect to polysaccharide and hampered the preparation of fractions suitable for amino acid sequence determination. However, fractions representative of individual segments of the primary structure of the protein moiety were obtained. Their amino acid sequences were determined by conventional procedures. These fractions represent 35 of the 124 amino acid residues in the molecule. By reference to the amino acid sequence of porcine ribonuclease, determined in concurrent experiments, the three sites of polysaccharide attachment were recognized to be at positions 21, 34, and 76, designated as Sites I, II, and III, respectively. Aspartic acid occupies each of these positions and it is presumed that the carbohydrate-peptide attachment in each is represented by a β-N-aspartamido-2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxyglucopyranoside unit. By reference to the structure of bovine ribonuclease, the three attachment sites are recognized to be at residues which have external side chains in regions of the molecule remote from the active site. The polysaccharides at the three sites have notably different compositions. The side chain at Site II contains 2 N-acetylglucosamine and 6 mannose residues. With respect to composition and site of attachment it is homologous with the single polysaccharide side chain in bovine ribonuclease B. The side chains at Sites I and III are about twice as large as that at Site II and display a more complex composition. In addition to N-acetylglucosamine and mannose, they contain galactose, fucose, and N-glycolylneuraminic acid. All three attachment sites are in sequences of the type: [see PDF for equation] At Sites I and III residue B is serine; at Site II, it is methionine. The present results, considered in relation to data in the literature, suggest the hypothesis that the nature of residue B exerts a determinative influence on the manner in which the polysaccharide is elaborated during glycoprotein biosynthesis: when residue B is polar, the side chain elaborated is of the more complex type; when B is apolar, the elaboration of the simpler mannose—N-acetylglucosamine side chain is favored."

https://openalex.org/W1495424041,"Abstract On incubation of ferricytochrome c with bromoacetate in the presence of cyanide, the methionyl residues at positions 65 and 80 are alkylated. A similar product can be obtained by alkylating cytochrome c dimer in the absence of cyanide. In the oxidized form of the reaction product, three different spectrophotometric types can be observed between pH values of 2.8 and 7.0. At neutral pH, the alkylated cytochrome c cannot be reduced with H2, ascorbate, or cysteine. The extinction coefficient of the reduced product at 520 and 550 mµ increases up to pH 10, at which it finally reaches the value for the native unsubstituted protein. The modified hemoprotein in both oxidation states readily forms complexes with metal ligands. In the reduced state, it forms a complex with molecular oxygen. Carboxymethylation of the methionyl residues renders cytochrome c inactive in restoring the respiration of cytochrome c-depleted rat liver mitochondria and in the succinic oxidase enzyme system."
https://openalex.org/W1582075931,"Binding of bilirubin with mitochondria, mitochondrial membranes, various cells, and cellular fragments resulted in a hypochromicity with a red shift of the absorption spectrum of bilirubin. It was found that the mitochondrial lipids rather than the proteins were involved in the binding. Isolated mitochondrial lipid and lipids from various other sources caused similar spectral changes of the bilirubin absorbance. Exogenous lipid could prevent the toxic effect of bilirubin on well defined mitochondrial reactions as did serum albumin. Washing of bilirubin-treated mitochondria with albumin restored their normal function to a considerable extent. These findings suggest that the binding of bilirubin with lipid alters the characteristics of mitochondrial membranes so that membrane-linked functions are impaired. In view of the lipophilic nature of bilirubin, this explanation might be considered as a mechanism of toxicity of bilirubin for cells in general."

https://openalex.org/W1937060797,"Abstract A highly purified preparation of 1,2-α-l-fucosidase, free of β-galactosidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activities, has been obtained from a commercial preparation of Aspergillus niger by a simple isolation procedure involving ammonium sulfate precipitation, pressure dialysis, repeated gel filtration on Sephadex G-150, and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex A-50. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 3.8 ± 0.2 and Km and Vmax values of 8.3 x 10-5 m and 16.0 µmoles per mg per hour, respectively, at 37° for methyl 2-O-α-l-fucopyranosyl-β-d-galactoside as substrate. The detailed specificity studies indicate that it is highly specific for nonreducing terminal l-fucose residues linked to d-galactose residues by 1 → 2-α linkage. It hydrolyzes fucose residues quantitatively from 2-O-α-l-fucopyranosyl-d-galactose, 2-O-α-l-fucosyllactose, and lacto-N-fucopentaose I. It does not split p-nitrophenyl-α-l-fucoside, 2-O-, 3-O-, and 4-O-α-l-fucopyranosylfucoses, and 3-O- and 4-O-α-l-fucopyranosyl-d-galactoses. It also does not release any focuse from oligosaccharides of human milk such as lacto-N-fucopentaose II, lacto-N-fucopentaose III, and 3'-O-α-l-fucosyllactose. The enzyme liberates 80 to 90% of fucose residues from porcine and canine submaxillary mucins. It has no action on orosomucoid, human chorionic gonadotropin, and fucan sulfate. The enzyme is extremely active against human blood group substance H, destroying virtually all of the detectable activity."
https://openalex.org/W1554971596,"Abstract Preparations of thyrotropin which are purified by standard procedures of column chromatography contain several electrophoretically distinct components which have exophthalmogenic activity and contain galactose. Although preparative disc gel electrophoresis can resolve these heterogeneous preparations into individual glycoproteins, several of the resultant components still have both thyrotropic and exophthalmogenic activity. Two such glycoproteins, each with both activities, are homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge, with a molecular weight of 27,000 ± 3,000. They have a similar, if not identical, amino acid composition. Previous suggestions that the determinants for both thyrotropic and exophthalmogenic activity can reside on the same glycoprotein molecule are reinforced by these data. Terminal galactose residues of glycoproteins may be enzymatically labeled with tritium. This procedure involves a preliminary exposure of the glycoprotein to galactose oxidase and subsequent reduction with (3H) sodium borohydride. Application of this technique has established the terminal nature of galactose in the multiactive but homogeneous preparations obtained by preparative gel electrophoresis. Both the thyrotropic and the exophthalmogenic activities are preserved in the tritiated glycoproteins. The procedure is applicable to crude pituitary preparations, the tritium serving as a convenient marker of the individual thyrotropic and exophthalmogenic species once the several contaminant glycoproteins have been removed. Thyroid-stimulating hormone derived from mouse transplantable tumors also contains terminal galactose which can be labeled by tritiation. Distinct differences from bovine thyrotropin can otherwise be shown in its sugar composition."
https://openalex.org/W1539280472,"Abstract Porcine pancreatic ribonuclease is a glycoprotein in which the associated heteropolysaccharide is distributed among three side chains. The preceding paper describes experiments that established the amino acid sequences of glycopeptide fractions, isolated from a tryptic hydrolysate of the reduced, S-aminoethylated protein, which were representative of those regions of the molecule around the sites of carbohydrate-peptide attachment. In the present communication the isolation of tryptic peptides representative of the remainder of the amino acid residues in the single peptide chain is described. The amino acid sequences of these peptides were determined by conventional methods. The order in which the tryptic peptides occur in the molecule was established by a combined approach that involved the utilization of chymotryptic hydrolysis and selective cleavage with cyanogen bromide. Coupled with knowledge of the pairing of the half-cystine residues, the results establish the primary structure of the protein moiety in porcine pancreatic ribonuclease. Comparison of the structure with the structures of the bovine and rat enzymes clearly reveals those features of the ribonuclease molecule that are conserved during speciation. They comprise the residues of the substrate-binding and catalytic sites and the side chains that contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic core of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1630128553,"Abstract Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase is 90% inactivated by binding 2 to 4 moles of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate per mole of tetrameric enzyme. Incubation with pyridoxal-5'-P in 0.2 m imidazole (pH 7.5) results in a time-dependent loss of enzymatic activity which reaches a final value in 10 to 20 min at 25°. Half-maximal loss of activity occurs with 0.04 mm pyridoxal-5'-P. The inactivation is not accompanied by a gross conformational change. The inactivation is first order with respect to pyridoxal-5'-P concentration and enzyme concentration; the second order rate constant is 37 m-1 sec-1. Generally, increasing the ionic strength decreases the rate of inactivation by pyridoxal-5'-P, but low concentrations (1 to 10 mm) of divalent cations increase it above the level with no salt. The phosphate-containing metabolites, ADP, ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, and fructose diphosphate, also decrease the rate; the effect is more pronounced in the presence of low concentrations (0.1 mm) of divalent cations. The inactivation is relatively specific for pyridoxal-5'-P, since various analogues including pyridoxamine, pyridoxamine 5-phosphate, and pyridoxal cause little or no inactivation. Reduction with NaBH4 at various concentrations of pyridoxal-5'-P shows that there are two types of binding: (a) a specific, inactivating binding, involving 2 to 4 moles of pyridoxal-5'-P bound per mole of enzyme, and (b) a nonspecific, noninactivating binding which can involve 20 or more additional moles of pyridoxal-5'-P bound per mole of enzyme. Both types involve Schiff base formation with e-NH2 groups of lysine. Reversal of the inactivation is accomplished, only with unreduced enzyme, by dilution, by dialysis, or by addition of Tris."

https://openalex.org/W1585719366,"Abstract Citrate synthase has a molecular weight of 1.0 x 105, as determined from sedimentation equilibrium and also from a combination of hydrodynamic properties. The sedimentation and diffusion coefficients were found to be 6.0 S and 5.8 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1, respectively, and the intrinsic viscosity was 3.95 ml g-1. Optical rotatory dispersion showed a 233 mµ trough and a 198 mµ peak with [m']233 = -7,150 and [m']198 = +28,500 deg cm2 dmole-1; the b0 of the Moffitt equation was -240. Circular dichroism showed a double minimum at 222 and 210 mµ and a maximum at 191 mµ with [θ]222 = -20,000, [θ]210 = -21,000, and [θ]191 = +42,000 deg cm2 dmole-1. These findings indicate the presence of a moderate amount of α-helical segments in the protein molecule. Citrate synthase does not dissociate in the presence of 2 m KCl, dioxane, 8 m urea, p-chloromercuribenzoate, or β-mercaptoethanol, but it can be readily split into two physically indistinguishable subunits upon succinylation. The succinylated subunit was enzymatically inactive. Its sedimentation coefficient was one-half that of the native enzyme and its diffusion coefficient was reduced by about 10%. The optical properties also suggested a helical content of about one-half that of the native protein. Citrate synthase can also dissociate into two subunits in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, but the molecule becomes completely unordered."

https://openalex.org/W1575777410,"The rate and extent of reaction of bovine α-lactalbumin with iodoacetate has been examined under conditions where only the side chains of methionine 90, histidine 32, histidine 68, and histidine 107 are carboxymethylated extensively. Examination of the amino acid composition of partially carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin and the tryptic peptides from carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin indicated that methionine 90 was the most reactive residue. Histidine 68 reacted with iodoacetate at a slower rate, but more rapidly than histidine 32. Histidine 107 was carboxymethylated at a rate much slower than the other histidyl residues. The relative rates of reaction of these residues are generally in accord with those which may be expected on consideration of the predicted conformation of α-lactalbumin. Carboxymethylation of the histidyl and methionyl residues does not completely destroy the ability of α-lactalbumin to stimulate lactose synthesis. Carboxymethylation of methionine 90 has little effect on the activity of α-lactalbumin, but there is a progressive loss in activity as the histidyl residues are carboxymethylated. When all three residues were modified, about 40% of the activity of α-lactalbumin remained."

https://openalex.org/W1482878666,"Human hemoglobin A exhibits pH-dependent and deoxygenation-dependent ultraviolet difference spectra which can be ascribed to perturbations of aromatic chromophores in the protein. The spectra support the presence of changes in protein structure with ligand binding. The pH-dependent spectra of carbon monoxide hemoglobin with peaks at 288.5 mµ and representing titrations with pK' = 7.36 at 3° and 7.03 at 23° (ΔH' = 6 kcal per mole) probably are due to perturbation of a tyrosyl by a histidyl residue. Oxyhemoglobin, ferrihemoglobin, and ferrihemoglobin cyanide show very similar spectra, but for deoxyhemoglobin the spectrum is only one-fourth as large and pK' increases by about 0.7 pH unit. Among carbon monoxide hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, ferrihemoglobin, and ferrihemoglobin cyanide, form-dependent spectra show only broad bands attributable to the heme groups, but when compared to deoxyhemoglobin narrow banded difference spectra with peaks near 291 mµ appear and are probably due to tryptophanyl perturbation. The difference spectra persist in the presence of deaggregation induced by KCl. This, with the absence (or diminution) of the spectra in isolated subunits of hemoglobin, as shown in the following paper, and the known structure of hemoglobin can be used to make tentative identification of the interchain region (the α1β2 contact) and the specific residues involved in the perturbations (tyrosine C7α(42) perturbed by histidine FG4β(97) for pH-dependent and tryptophan C3(β(37) for form-dependent spectra). The deoxygenation-dependent change in pK' reflects a portion of the Bohr effect. The deoxygenation-dependent change in magnitude of the pH-dependent spectra and the existence of the form-dependent spectra probably reflect the known conformational isomerization with deoxygenation. Tryptophan C3β(37) may be critical for interchain interactions and thus for production of functional properties through interaction with α and β chain vinyl groups in the α1β2 contact."
https://openalex.org/W1608347739,"Abstract A phytotoxic glycopeptide was isolated from cultures of Corynebacterium sepedonicum and from potato plants infected by this pathogen. The glycopeptides from both sources were identical with respect to their mobility by paper and acrylamide gel electrophoresis, optical rotation, infrared spectra, x-ray diffraction patterns, sugar, organic acid and amino acid content, molecular weight as judged by their elution volumes from Sephadex G-200 columns, serological reactivity, and reaction with ninhydrin. The glycopeptide was present in infected plants in quantities large enough to account for symptom production in biological assay tests. The compound meets the requirements of a vivotoxin. The purified bacterial glycopeptide has its isoelectric point at about pH 2.1. The specific optical rotation of the compound is [α]30d = +32.0°. Alanine and glycine occur in a 3:2 ratio as NH2-terminal amino acids. The amino acid composition of the peptide portion of the molecule is: Asp1, Thr1, Ser1, Gly1, Lys1, Ala1, Met1, Glu2, and His1. The peptide makes up about 4.4% of the weight of the toxin molecule. The sugar composition of the toxin is 48% glucose, 13% mannose, and approximately 1% l-fucose. 2-Keto-3-deoxygluconic acid contributes to the acidic nature of the toxin.

https://openalex.org/W1841221206,"Abstract The effect of 2'-cytidylic acid and 3'-cytidylic acid upon the binding of cupric ions by RNase has been studied by gel filtration, together with the effect of cupric ions upon binding of 2'- and 3'-cytidylic acids. The results confirm that binding of 2'-CMP by RNase weakens its affinity for cupric ions; reciprocally, binding of cupric ion diminishes the affinity of RNase for 2'-CMP. The negative interactions between cupric ion and 2'-CMP upon binding to RNase have been shown to lead to distortion of the gel filtration ligand trough. At pH 5.5 these interactions are tentatively interpreted in terms of competition between 2'-CMP and Cu(II) for the strongest Cu(II)-binding site on RNase together with an acetate-dependent increase in the Cu(II) affinity of one of the weaker RNase sites in the presence of bound 2'-CMP. Binding of 3'-CMP to RNase increases the affinity of RNase for 2 cupric ions; similarly binding of cupric ions to RNase increases its affinity for 3'-CMP. Analysis of the binding pattern of Cu(II) to the 3'-CMP-RNase complex indicates co-operative interactions between two Cu(II)-binding sites on the 3'-CMP-RNase complex; at least one of these sites differs from any on free RNase and could involve the phosphate group of 3'-CMP. In further contrast to free RNase, the Cu(II)-binding sites at pH 5.5 on the 3'-CMP-RNase complex have been shown to have a diminished affinity for the cupric ion-monoacetate complex relative to free cupric ion. This suggests that, on the average, Cu(II) is coordinated with more ligands on the 3'-CMP-RNase complex than on free RNase or, alternatively, that binding of Cu(II) to the complex occurs in a more sterically limited environment than on free RNase."
