https://openalex.org/W1549614989,"Abstract The interaction of 3H-progesterone in vitro with the chromatins from several chick tissues was investigated. Progesterone, complexed with an oviduct cytosol protein (the receptor for progesterone), binds more extensively (about 10-fold) with oviduct chromatin than does the free hormone. However, progesterone in combination with cytosol from liver or spleen or with chick serum shows very little binding to oviduct chromatin. Part of the hormone-receptor complex can be reextracted intact from the chromatin by treatment with high salt. The association of the labeled progesterone in oviduct cytosol with the oviduct chromatin in vitro is sensitive to conditions of temperature, ionic strength, and pH. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, the progesterone-oviduct receptor complex displays more extensive binding to oviduct chromatin than to the chromatins of chick spleen, heart, mature erythrocytes, or liver. Thus, the target tissue chromatin may contain acceptor sites for the steroid hormone-receptor complex. This extensive binding is maintained in chromatins which have been dissociated and reconstituted in high salt and urea. Hybrid chromatins composed of histones from chromatin of one tissue and the DNA with associated acidic proteins from the chromatin of another tissue were reconstituted. The association of the progesterone-oviduct cytosol complex with these hybrid chromatins demonstrates that the acidic proteins of oviduct chromatin are responsible for the extensive association of progesterone with the oviduct chromatin. Furthermore, chromatin reconstituted without the acidic protein fraction from oviduct is not extensively bound by progesterone. Finally, studies with dehistonized chromatin as well as with pure DNA support the concept that it is the acidic protein in association with DNA, and not the histone, which enhances chromatin binding of the steroid hormone-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1584666396,"Abstract In skeletal muscle microsomes, Ca2+ uptake activated by acetyl phosphate is inhibited by alkali ions. The inhibitory activity of these ions depends on the acetyl-P concentration in the assay medium. For 0.2 mm acetyl-P the pattern of inhibition is Li+ g Na+ g K+ = Rb+ = Cs+ and for 2.0 mm acetyl-P it is Na+ g Li+ ≥ K+ = Rb+ = Cs+. In assay media containing 7.1 µm Ca2+ and either 20 mm KCl, 120 mm KCl, or 120 mm NaCl, the plot of the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake against acetyl-P concentration yields hyperbolic saturation curves. In an assay medium containing 120 mm LiCl, this saturation curve has a sigmoidal shape. In the presence of 2 mm acetyl-P, the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake measured as a function of the Ca2+ concentration in the assay medium displays a saturation curve with a sigmoidal shape. However, if ATP is used as substrate, a hyperbolic saturation curve is obtained. For 2 mm acetyl-P, the inhibitory activity of the alkali ions depends on the Ca2+ concentration in the assay medium. For Ca2+ concentrations ranging from 1 to 2 µm, the pattern of inhibition is Li+ ≥ Na+ g K+, and for Ca2+ concentration of 7.1 µm, the pattern of inhibition is Na+ g Li+ ≥ K+."
https://openalex.org/W1972784483,"Principles of functional organization of the bilaterally symmetric buccal ganglia of Aplysia were studied in 20 identified cells used as a reference population. Four of the identified cells (two in each ganglion) are multiaction interneurons, each of which innervates six identified ipsilateral follower cells, mediating cholinergic excitation to one cell and cholinergic inhibition to five others. Bilateral coordination is effected by common inputs to all four interneurons. Ipsilateral pairs of interneurons are electrotonically coupled and produce identical synaptic actions on their common follower population. This apparent redundancy of interneuronal action leads to feed-forward summation, eliciting amplified synaptic output from each interneuron pair."

Simultaneously, the depolarizing action of intracellularly injected chloride ions on the inhibitory membrane is enhanced and recovery therefrom is prolonged. Passive membrane properties remain unaltered. The results indicate a blocking of active extrusion of chloride which normally maintains a high ionic gradient for hyperpolarizing inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2043427249,The click-evoked electrical responses of the human cochlear nerve were recorded from the external ear canal concurrently with the cortical evoked potentials from the scalp. Paying attention to the clicks during a discrimination task resulted in a highly significant enhancement of the cortical response but no change in the cochlear nerve response. Hence no evidence was obtained for the operation of a peripheral gating mechanism during attention in man.

https://openalex.org/W1498577073,"Abstract Cerebroside sulfotransferase, the enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of the sulfate group from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to galactosylceramide to form sulfogalactosylceramide is located primarily in microsomes and possibly in myelin of 17-day-old rat brain. Subfractionation of the microsomes demonstrates the enzyme activity to be present in the lighter, smooth membrane fraction. Virtually all of the cerebroside sulfotransferase activity can be extracted with Triton X-100. The extracted enzyme demonstrates a linear response for 2 hours in the presence of exogenous substrate, galactosylceramide, and has an apparent Km of 8 x 10-5 m. Cruder preparations such as homogenate or microsomes without added substrate were linear for only about 15 min. This lack of linearity appears to be related to decreased availability of endogenous substrate. Both α-hydroxy fatty acid galactosylsphingosine and nonhydroxy fatty acid galactosylsphingosine act as sulfate acceptors. Two further galactosphingolipids, lactosylceramide and galactosylsphingosine, can act as sulfate acceptors in vitro. Small amounts of lactosylceramide have been found in both normal and abnormal brain, whereas naturally occurring galactosylsphingosine has not been described. Glucosylceramide and other lipids examined were unable to act as acceptors for sulfate in this extracted system. [6-3H] Galactosylceramide was utilized as an acceptor for the sulfate group from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phospho-[35S]sulfate. The isolated product, sulfogalactosylceramide, contained both the tritium and 35SO4 label, indicating that the exogenous galactosylceramide could be utilized as a substrate by cerebroside sulfotransferase of brain."

https://openalex.org/W1557366298,"Abstract The synthesis of proteins, as indicated by the incorporation of triatiated leucine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material, was studied in vivo in the rat parotid gland. In a series of preliminary studies, it was shown that in the rat parotid gland most of the incorporated label was used for the synthesis of secretory materials. In animals fed solid chow there was a diurnal variation in the rate of synthesis. During the day, as the gland stores of zymogen granule materials increased, synthesis decreased. Conversely, during the night, as these stores of secretory products were expelled, synthesis increased. If solid chow was replaced by liquid chow, secretion was not stimulated, the gland became atrophic, and the gland stores of secretory products were reduced to low levels. Synthesis also decreased to a stable level equivalent to 50% of the initial 8 a.m. level; no diurnal pattern was seen. If animals were then refed solid chow, synthesis was increased to normal levels. It was concluded that, in addition to stimulating secretion, mastication also plays a role in regulating the synthesis of the secretory products."

https://openalex.org/W1587117096,"Abstract CNBr cleaves nonreduced human serum albumin into three large fragments, A, B, and C, which account for the total amino acid composition of albumin. Reduction and carboxamidomethylation of the free —SH groups produce four subfragments from A, identified according to their NH2-terminal amino acid residues as A-ProI (32 residues), A-AsxI (38 residues), A-ProII (109 residues), and A-Phe (92 residues). A small residue which contains no homoserine is unaccounted for in this sum of the subfragments in A. A-AsxI contains the COOH-terminal leucine of albumin. Reduction and carboxamidomethylation of fragment B produce two further subfragments, B-Ala (36 residues) and B-AspII (89 residues). These subfractions account for all amino acid residues in B. B-AspII contains the NH2-terminal Asp and free —SH group of albumin. Fragment C has only one peptide chain (164 residues) with an NH2-terminal Cys residue. Heterogeneity in disulfide linkages is evident in some preparations."

https://openalex.org/W1601755777,Abstract Cell-tree extracts of Mucor rouxii contain enzymes which synthesize uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-d-glucosamine from N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Procedures are described to prepare radiolabeled UDP-GlcNAc using cell-free extracts or living cells of this fungus. This sugar nucleotide serves as the precursor for chitin synthesis. Free N-acetyl-d-glucosamine is a strong activator of chitin synthesis. Chitin synthetase activity is found in the different particulate fractions of the cell. The cell walls are particularly rich in chitin synthetase activity. Autoradiographic studies showed that chitin synthetase is localized preferentially in the apical region of hyphal walls. This is also the region of chitin deposition in vivo. The total chitin synthetase content of a culture was shown to increase concomitantly with cell growth and with the total hexosamine content of the cells.
https://openalex.org/W1602102867,"Abstract A number of substrate analogues of serine transhydroxymethylase were tested as competitive inhibitors and substrates. Our previous results show that l-serine, l-threonine, allothreonine, and d-alanine serve as substrates. In this study, we found that threo- and erythro-β-phenylserine were cleaved to benzaldehyde and glycine. Tetrahydrofolate was not required for this reaction. Substrate analogues which contained an amino group adjacent to a carboxyl, phosphonate, or sulfonate group were bound by the enzyme. Analogues which lacked either the amino group or a carboxyl group of the amino acid had little if any affinity for the active site. The only exceptions to this were several sulfhydryl compounds. Several d-amino acids were competitive inhibitors with d-cysteine being the most effective. This shows that the configuration around the α-carbon of the amino acid is not critical for substrate binding. The variation of Vmax and Km with pH for the substrate allothreonine was determined. Both Vmax and Km were found not to change from pH 5.8 to 7.6. However, an anion binding site on the enzyme with a pK of 6.2 was found. This site showed little specificity for anions with all anions tested serving as competitive inhibitors. The enzyme-glycine complex exhibits absorption maxima at 343, 425, and 495 mµ. The equilibrium between the complexes absorbing at 343 and 425 mµ was found to be sensitive to both temperature and pH. A group on the enzyme-glycine complex with a pK of 6.9 was found to be involved. The temperature sensitivity was observed to be due in part to a large increase in entropy, which suggests that conformational changes in the protein are also involved in the interconversion of the enzyme-glycine complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1557401501,"Abstract When cells of the marine pseudomonad B-16 (ATCC 19855) grown in nutrient broth-salts medium containing 0.01 m KCl, were washed in a complete salts solution consisting of 0.3 m NaCl, 0.05 m MgSO4, and 0.01 m KCl the intracellular K+ concentration was approximately 0.3 m and the cells rapidly accumulated α-aminoisobutyric acid-14C (AIB-14C). Cells washed with 0.05 m MgSO4 solution alone lost some 95 to 98% of the total intracellular K+. Transport studies revealed that K+-depleted cells resuspended in salts solution containing 0.3 m NaCl, 0.05 m MgSO4, and 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) failed to accumulate AIB-14C. Penetration studies under these conditions showed that α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) nevertheless entered the cells, and occupied the total available fluid space in a packed cell preparation of K+-depleted cells. Entry of AIB was Na+ dependent, and equivalent concentrations of Li+ or K+ failed to replace this cation in mediating AIB penetration and equilibration. Addition of K+ to the equilibrated system resulted in rapid accumulation of the substrate. The rate of AIB accumulation was maximal at 0.01 m KCl and kinetic analysis revealed that K+ increased Vmax but did not change the Km for transport. Additions of adenine nucleotides further increased the rate of AIB accumulation in the presence but not in the absence of K+. When K+-depleted cells were again loaded with K+ and subsequently transferred to AIB uptake medium lacking K+, there was immediate and rapid accumulation of substrate. Active transport of AIB is apparently mediated by two distinct cation-dependent steps. The first stage involves the entry and equilibration of AIB into the cells by a Na+-dependent facilitated diffusion mechanism. In the K+-dependent second stage, the cation, acting at the intracellular level, brings about the accumulation of AIB against a concentration gradient."
https://openalex.org/W1596472619,"Abstract We have studied the ligand-binding reactions of lamprey (Petromyzon marinus and Petromyzon fluviatilis) hemoglobin with O2 and CO in the pH range 9.0 to 5.6 by means of both rapid reaction and equilibrium techniques. All the data can be accurately described by a model in which it is assumed that there are two forms of hemoglobin, a high affinity monomer and a lower affinity dimer, and that the formation of the dimer is pH dependent and requires the protonation on the protein of one specific site which has a pK of 6.0. For the deoxyhemoglobin monomer-dimer reactions, the dissociation equilibrium constant, K2,1, is estimated as 0.5 µm at pH 5.6; the association rate constant as 2 x 106 m-1sec-1; and the dissociation rate constant as 1 per sec. The binding rates for the reaction of CO with the monomer and the dimer are 0.9 x 106 m-1 sec-1 and 0.12 x 106 m-1 sec-1, respectively, and for the reaction of O2, 10 x 106 m-1 sec-1 and 0.25 x 106 m-1 sec-1. The dissociation rates of CO and O2 from the monomer are 0.09 and 80 per sec, respectively, and for the monomer the partition coefficient, M, is 89. In the proposed mechanism the deoxyhemoglobin dimer itself is supposed to be noncooperative, and cooperativity, as seen at acid pH, results from the oxygen-linked dissociation of the liganded dimer which has a dissociation rate constant of 150 per sec. This dissociation gives rise to a high affinity species, and thus produces the observed cooperativity. The rate constants that gave the best fits to the kinetic data were used to simulate equilibrium O2-binding curves. The model accurately predicts the equilibrium behavior of this protein without considering aggregation above the level of the dimer. Physiologically, higher aggregates may not have functional importance."

https://openalex.org/W1931694652,"Abstract An homogenate of rat liver which was capable of converting 2-3H-lanosta-8, 24-dien-3β-ol to 2-3H-cholest-5-en-3β-ol failed to convert 2-3H-9,19-cyclolanost-24-en-3β-ol to 2-3H-cholest-5-en-3β-ol. However, both substrates underwent reduction at C-24,25. 2-3H-9,19-Cyclolanost-24-en-3β-ol was not converted to 2-3H-lanosta-8,24-dien-3β-ol. Both the presence and biosynthesis (from 2-14C-mevalonate) of 9,19-cyclolanost-24-en-3β-ol were demonstrated in vivo in corn seedlings. The latter were also shown to contain 24ξ-stigmast-5-en-3β-o1 as their dominant sterol with lesser amounts of 24ξ-ergost-5-en-3β-ol and 24ξ-stigmasta-5, trans22-dien-3β-ol. A very small amount of cholest-5-en-3β-ol and traces of 9,19-cyclolanostan-3β-ol and 24-methylene-9,19-cyclolanostan-3β-ol were detected. The three major sterols as well as stigmasta-5,24(28)-dien-3β-ol and 24-methylene-9,19-cyclolanostan-3β-ol (but not lanosta-8,24-dien-3β-ol) were shown to be labeled after incubation with 2-14C-mevalonate in vivo. The corn seedlings, when presented with either lanosta-8,24-dien-3β-ol (labeled biosynthetically with 14C or chemically with tritium) or labeled 9,19-cyclolanost-24-en-3β-ol (similarly biosynthetically or chemically labeled), produced labeled 4-desmethyl-Δ5-sterols, primarily 24ξ-stigmast-5-en-3β-ol and stigmasta-5, 24(28)-dien-3β-ol. The yields were nearly the same from either substrate. The latter data, which were obtained in vivo with an angiosperm, confirm earlier observations made in vivo with an alga and with tissue cultures of an angiosperm. They indicate that lanosta-8,24-dien-3β-ol (lanosterol) and its 9,19-cyclo derivative (cycloartenol) are both acceptable precursors in the biosynthesis of the major sterols of photosynthetic organisms. However, the data obtained with the liver homogenate demonstrate that a typical (nonphotosynthetic) tissue of the animal kingdom is more restricted in its enzymatic capability. The liver preparation did not contain an isomerase for the opening of the 9,19-cyclo grouping, and, except for the Δ24-reductase, the enzymes in the pathway would not accept the 9,19-cyclosteroid. Consequently, discrimination between lanosta-8,24-dien-3β-ol and its 9,19-cyclo derivative in liver is made at two points in the sterol pathway (cyclization and utilization), whereas in photosynthetic systems only one point (cyclization) governs the choice."
https://openalex.org/W3119817776,"Abstract From studies with a large number of l-γ-glutamyl derivatives, it has been found that formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) amidotransferase can catalyze the hydrolysis of esters, thioesters, and substituted amides in addition to the amide bond of glutamine. The hydrolytic reactions are dependent on the presence of FGAR, ATP, and Mg2+; however, in contrast to the reaction of glutamine they are not accompanied by the stoichiometric formation of ADP in the case of amides and there is no ADP formation when esters and thioesters are substrates. Km and Vm values are reported for l-γ-glutamylmethoxyamide, l-γ-glutamylhydroxamate, l-γ-glutamylhydrazide, γ-methyl l-glutamate, and γ-ethyl l-glutamate. Km values of FGAR and MgATP2- for these l-γ-glutamyl derivatives are also reported. In the case of the hydrolysis of l-γ-glutamyl esters and thioesters, only a catalytic amount of FGAR is needed. In the reaction catalyzed by FGAR amidotransferase ethanol is released from γ-ethyl l-glutamate in amounts equal to the glutamate formed. Thus, when l-γ-glutamyl esters or thioesters were used as substrates, the reactions of the glutamine site can be separated from those of the whole FGAR-amidotransferase complex. Both glutamine and NH4Cl inhibit the enzymatic reaction with respect to γ-ethyl l-glutamate as substrate. Hydrazine and methylamine are competitive and mixed type inhibitors of the reaction, respectively, with glutamine as substrate. On the other hand, l-γ-glutamylmethylamide, l-γ-glutamylhydroxamate, and γ-methyl l-glutamate all acted as mixed type inhibitors of the reaction relative to NH4Cl. The effect of a number of monovalent cations on the enzyme activity is examined. Potassium ion is required for maximum activity whereas sodium ion inhibits the enzyme probably at the FGAR-MgATP site."
https://openalex.org/W1555626267,"Abstract Human peripheral lymphocytes were incubated in the presence of Phaseolus vulgaris phytohemagglutinin. The rate of incorporation of 14CO2 into the acid-soluble uridine nucleotides of the phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cells and their carbamyl-P synthetase activity were determined. The rate of 14CO2 incorporation increased markedly after an initial lag of about 24 hours, the rate at 48 hours of culture being about 4 times as much as that of freshly isolated cells. On the other hand, the rate of 14CO2 incorporation in cultures without phytohemagglutinin decreased gradually. At least 80% of the radioactivity fixed into the acid-soluble uridine nucleotides was due to 14C incorporated into the C-2 position of uracil. Preceding the increase in 14CO2 incorporation, a significant elevation of carbamyl-P synthetase activity was found. Enzyme activity at 48 hours of culture was about 4 times that of freshly isolated cells. The elevation of enzyme activity could be prevented either by puromycin or by actinomycin D. The increase in enzyme activity was shown to be a result of enzyme induction rather than activation of a previously existing enzyme. Properties of the induced enzyme were, so far as we have examined, indistinguishable from those of the glutamine-utilizing carbamyl-P synthetase which is distributed in a wide variety of mammalian tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1507081240,"Abstract Photolysis of 14C-labeled diazoacetyl α-chymotrypsin incorporates radiocarbon into the protein; O-carboxymethyl-tyrosine had previously been found in the hydrolysate of the photolysis product. Now this tyrosine residue has been identified as number 146 in the amino acid sequence by partial degradation of the protein, followed by enzymic release of the labeled residue. It has been further identified by showing that photolysis of diazoacetyl δ-chymotrypsin (where the carboxyl end of tyrosine 146 is not free) yields little if any carboxymethyltyrosine. These and other data suggest that the reaction with tyrosine 146 occurs in the chymotrypsin dimer, between one subunit and its neighbor."

Hematin was as effective as, or superior to, the acetone extract in restoring the activity in three of the four apoperoxidases. The pyridine hemochromogen spectra of the acetone extract and hematin were similar, but not identical, and, because other substances in the acetone extract may have altered the spectrum of the native prosthetic group, its identification was inconclusive. However, the data conclusively show that the prosthetic group of thyroid peroxidase is not covalently linked to the apoenzyme and that ferriprotoporphyrin IX, or a closely related iron porphyrin, is essential for enzymatic activity."

There was no significant effect of halothane on the conformation of the α chain whereas the helicity in the β chain of hemoglobin was significantly decreased in the presence of halothane at 23°. These changes were reversed by re-equilibration of the hemoglobin solution with air at 37°. The effect of the d and l enantiomers of halothane on oxyhemoglobin was the same as the racemic mixture.

https://openalex.org/W1574162569,"Abstract Both deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb) and carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) from the lamprey Petromyzon marinus undergo subunit association-dissociation equilibria. By means of sedimentation equilibrium techniques these equilibria were examined at a variety of heme concentrations and at pH values from 4.9 to 8.5. The reactions for deoxyHb are described by the scheme: Hb4 (K4,2)/⇌ 2Hb2 (K2,1)/⇌ 4Hb Both constants are pH dependent above pH 6.0, while below this pH they are essentially invariant and have values of K4,2 = 600 µm and K2,1 = 0.4 µm. The association of single chains to dimers is most simply explained by assuming that protonation of one site per monomer promotes dimer formation: the pK of this site in deoxyHb is calculated to be 6.0. At higher pH the value of K2,1 increases rapidly, and a plot of log K2,1 versus pH is linear with a slope of 2. Aggregation of HbCO and oxyhemoglobin, HbO2, occurs via similar reactions. Below pH 6.0 K'2,1, the dissociation equilibrium constant for HbCO, is essentially invariant with a value of 0.4 mm, and, for this liganded form, the pK of the protonatable group is also estimated to be 6.0. This value of K'2,1 agrees well with the value expected for HbO2 from the linkage requirements of the O2-binding equilibria. Association of HbCO to tetramers also occurs, and at low pH K'4,2 for HbCO is approximately 2 to 3 mm. The calculated values of the association-dissociation equilibrium constants suggest that at pH between 7.0 and 8.0 and at protein concentrations found in the lamprey erythrocyte, deoxyHb will be predominantly dimeric and HbO2 will be predominantly monomeric. Thus, oxygenation in the red cell is accompanied by dissociation. The cooperativity in ligand binding which is exhibited by lamprey hemoglobin can be explained by this linkage between ligation and subunit association-dissociation reactions. Under conditions where these interactions cannot occur, whether in dilute protein solution at alkaline pH or in strong protein solution at acid pH, cooperativity is greatly diminished. Finally, these physical properties of lamprey hemoglobin are used to formulate a model which accounts for the efficient transport of oxygen in vivo by these animals."

https://openalex.org/W206651205,"Abstract The subunit interactions of fumarase have been examined as a function of enzyme concentration, pH, and concentration of guanidine hydrochloride. Fumarase was found to dissociate, with loss of activity, either at low concentrations of the enzyme (l1 x 10-4 mg per ml), below pH 6, above pH 10, or in solutions of guanidine hydrochloride (g1 m). At pH 9 a species of enzyme was produced which was fully associated, but whose hydrodynamic structure was different from that of the native enzyme. Fumarase dissociated in dilute acid or alkali or by guanidine hydrochloride could be reassociated with nearly complete recovery of activity. The reassociation of the acid-dissociated fumarase was observed to follow first order kinetics with respect to enzyme concentration. l-Malate, citrate, phosphate, and ATP all reduced the rate of dissociation and increased the extent of recombination of the subunits. As judged by optical rotatory dispersion measurements, little change in polypeptide chain conformation was noted between native fumarase and the enzyme dissociated between pH 5 and 11. The thiol groups of the dissociated enzyme, however, were found to be more exposed to solvent than the same groups located in the tetrameric molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1519468139,"Abstract N-methylglutamate synthetase (glutamate + methylamine ⇌ N-methylglutamate + ammonia) from Pseudomonas MA (ATCC 23819) has been purified and characterized. The purified enzyme exhibits multiple bands on disc gel electrophoresis; however, sedimentation equilibrium studies on the native enzyme, the succinylated enzyme, and the enzyme in 7 m guanidine hydrochloride all indicate homogeneity. In the presence of glutamate the enzyme has an s20,ω value of 13, while in the absence of glutamate dissociation of the enzyme into two components (s20,ω of 11 and 2.8) occurs. The native enzyme (molecular weight 350,000) is composed of approximately 12 subunits (molecular weight 30,000 to 35,000). The enzyme is specific for the amino acid substrate, but a number of amines can substitute for methylamine."
https://openalex.org/W1505769170,"Abstract The ability of yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase to transfer the phenylalanyl moiety from its phenylalanyladenylate complex to purified yeast phenylalanine tRNA (tRNAphe) has been examined in the presence of various cations. With the assay conditions employed (10 mm Trisacetate, pH 7.2, 21°), this transfer reaction was completely dependent upon the addition of an oligovalent cation. Low concentrations of Mg2+, organic diamines, spermidine, or spermine were effective in stimulating the formation of phenylalanyl-tRNA. The concentration-dependent stimulation of the transfer reaction by Mg2+, spermidine, and spermine correlated reasonably well with the concentration-dependent enhancement of the fluorescence of tRNAphe effected by these same cations. Organic diamines (0.7 mm) exhibited a diminishing ability to stimulate the rate of the transfer reaction as the number of carbon atoms between the two amine groups increased. NaCl, at concentrations as high as 1.0 m, appeared not to stimulate the transfer reaction. In the presence of Mg2+ (0.3 mm), concentrations of NaCl greater than 0.2 m increasingly inhibited the rate of the transfer reaction. The cation-specific differences in transfer efficiency were shown not to be caused by any major variation in the stability of the phenylalanyladenylate-enzyme complex under the different ionic conditions examined. These results are consistent with those of our previous study of yeast tRNAphe (Robison, B., and Zimmerman, T. P., J. Biol. Chem., 246, 110 (1971)) in support of the hypothesis that the oligovalent cation-induced fluorescence/conformational changes of tRNAphe represent the conversion to its biologically active form, principally through the formation of tertiary structure."

The plhotoaddition intermediates represent a new class of dihydropyrimidines, namely analogs of 5,6-dihydro-5,6-cyclobutanyluracil and its nucleosides; the biological significance is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2398520998,"Purified formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase polymerizes when stored in solution at 0°. This polymerization can be inhibited by the presence of 2-mercapto-ethanol or dithiothreitol and is therefore probably a result of the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges. Although the glutamine-binding site of the enzyme contains at least one essential highly reactive, sulfhydryl group, this group is not involved in the formation of the intermolecular disulfide bridges, and the polymers retain full enzymatic activity. Preparations in an early stage of polymerization can be completely reduced to monomeric species by dithiothreitol or mercaptoethanol. Reduction of highly polymerized preparations is complete in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and thiol reagent. Treatment of the enzyme with these reagents does not result in the breakdown of the enzyme into units smaller than the catalytic unit (monomer) of molecular weight, 133,000."
https://openalex.org/W2031025989,"Selective dissemination of information to individuals provides a new and promising method for keeping abreast of current scientific information. Since SDI services are directed to the information needs of each individual, they are a significant step beyond grouporiented services and products, which require considerable expenditure of effort by each user as he sorts useful information from trash. However, SDI systems do require a high degree of precision in matching scientists against documents. They must operate more efficiently and economically than many current systems which occasionally provide a useful item of information to users. To meet these stringent requirements for quality, precision, efficiency, and economy, more research must be devoted to comparing and improving indexing methods, which are the basic component of all information storage and retrieval systems. It is incredible that so much money has been spent on the development and operation of scientific information systems before basic data on the comparative performance of various indexing methods have been gathered, analyzed, and confirmed by multiple investigators. The design of an effective information system would seem to require this type of basic knowledge, just as basic properties of alternative materials must be known before an engineer can design a building, bridge, or factory. Yet, except for the few studies mentioned in the previous section, research on indexing methods has been greatly neglected. Bourne's comment about studies of indexing languages is still an appropriate description of the situation: ""In almost all the experimental reports, the investigator worked with an indexing language different than that of other experimenters. Consequently, no one has ever had his test results verified, or expanded, or made more precise by another experimenter"" (47). Most existing information systems are based on keyword indexing, with concepts broken into isolated terms during input operations and recombined to synthesize the original concept during search and retrieval. Such systems tend to involve imprecise indexing, with a high level of ""noise"" in retrieved documents, difficult search strategy involving extensive post-coordination, and lengthy, complex computer manipulations. This situation reflects the fact that many producers of indexed data originally focused the design of their systems on the production of a published product with entries printed under short, concise index headings. Production of magnetic tapes as a by-product of the publication process, and their use for retrospective searching or for SDI services, was a much later development, almost an afterthought. Yet use of these tapes is growing so rapidly that it may be time to redesign the tape-producing systems, with ease of tape use for SDI services and retrospective searching as the primary consideration, and with publication of abstract and index bulletins or title listings relegated to secondary importance (49). The use of keywords to index documents creates a high degree of disorganization in information search and retrieval operations: Information is scattered under the many different terms that can be used to index different aspects of a concept. If the large-scale, comprehensive abstracting and indexing services were based on enumerative classifications with assignment of documents to logical hierarchical categories at the time of initial indexing, then many of the specialized information centers (50) and the 1300 abstracting and indexing services (3) would be unnecessary, and much of the reindexing and reprocessing of documents, the repackaging and reworking of abstracts and index data, and the resulting overlap and duplication characteristic of current information processing could be terminated. Partly because of the disorganization resulting from keyword indexing, the cost of a 5-year retrospective search of information on just one data base on magnetic tapes is a major investment (16). The effort and cost required to find a few items of useful information scattered among 1,285,000 abstracts indexed on 116 full reels of magnetic tape (11 million characters per reel) which will be needed for the 5-year Eighth Collective Index to Chemical Abstracts (1967-1971) (51) staggers the imagination. In contrast, when HICLASS systems based on enumerative hierarchical classifications are used, concepts that might be useful for later retrieval are identified and related items of information are grouped together during the indexing process. These enumerative classifications, with single-hit matching, make it possible to index and retrieve ideas as intact units and to perform simple sequential searches of the very small segment of a file that deals with a given topic (31). The experiments at both the Science Information Exchange and the National Cancer Institute, as described in this article, demonstrate that automated HICLASS systems are feasible and can operate at a very satisfactory level of performance. Although considerable effort may be required for the development and constant updating of detailed enumerative classifications, HICLASS categories may facilitate organization of data at the time of input, improve the precision of matching documents with users, and greatly simplify search logic and computer manipulations. If so, then output savings and performance would more than justify input costs, and the development and use of enumerative classifications would be a better solution to information problems than the current keyword-and-coordination approach. It is time to think beyond the ease of the single input step in information systems and to take a hard look at ways of easing retrieval problems for the multitude of information systems that process the indexed data (52). Indexing effort is expended only once, whereas search and retrieval effort is required by every user of a system. If information were better analyzed and organized during input operations, if more basic research were devoted to the effect of indexing methods on the performance of information systems, and if more emphasis were placed on the quality and usefulness of retrieved information, then the magnitude of problems related to the storage and retrieval of scientific information might be considerably reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1581367037,"Abstract 2-Keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase of Pseudomonas putida reacts with about 4 moles of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene per mole of aldolase; this is accompanied by 85 to 90% loss in activity. Both the arylation reaction and the inactivation are prevented by 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate, and inorganic phosphate. The substrate binding site was then blocked by adding 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate and reducing the azomethine linkage to a lysine residue with sodium borohydride. Subsequent dialysis of the treated enzyme to remove noncovalently bound 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate, followed by reaction with fluorodinitrobenzene, results in only one of the four originally observed dinitrophenylations. This indicates that 3 molecules of fluorodinitrobenzene react in or close to the active site. Only the lysine e-amino group is dinitrophenylated, and these lysines were shown to be distinct from those forming an azomethine with pyruvate, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate, and, presumably, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate. The Km of dinitrophenylated aldolase for 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate is about 2-fold higher than that of native aldolase, whereas there is a 10-fold decrease in Vmax. Thus, the loss in activity by dinitrophenylation seen at saturating 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate concentration is attributed to a decrease in catalysis rather than to a decrease in binding of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate. The rate of tritium exchange from T2O into pyruvate decreased about 10-fold following dinitrophenylation. Since tritium exchange in native 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase is only 2 to 3 times the rate of cleavage, the 10-fold loss of activity may be attributed to either direct or indirect impairment of the C—H bond cleavage part of the reaction mechanism. Discrepancies between the rate and extent of dinitrophenylation and the loss in activity were observed. These are attributed to a conformational change elicited by addition of the first molecule of fluorodinitrobenzene. An altered conformation is also supported by the unexpected change in pI to a more basic region, increased thermal stability, and decreased number of sulfhydryl groups available for titration with dithiodinitrobenzoate. The data do not support the hypothesis that dinitrophenylation impairs the substrate phosphate group binding site but, rather, that it effects changes in conformation which indirectly diminish catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1569362186,"Abstract Information concerning the mechanism of action of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) amidotransferase from chicken liver has been obtained from initial rate studies of the reaction of the three substrates of the enzyme system. The data are consistent with the belief that the substrates add sequentially to form a quaternary complex with the enzyme before undergoing reaction with release of products, and that glutamine adds first to the enzyme with ATP and FGAR adding randomly thereafter (partially compulsory order mechanism). Further studies with competitive and product inhibitors have led to this same conclusion. It was observed that albizziin, a competitive inhibitor of glutamine, acted as a mixed type inhibitor of the enzyme with respect to the other substrates. β,γ-5'-Adenylyl methylene diphosphonate, a competitive antagonist of ATP, acted as an uncompetitive and noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme with respect to glutamine and FGAR, respectively. Similarly, ADP functions as a competitive product inhibitor of the enzyme with respect to ATP but shows uncompetitive and mixed type inhibition patterns relative to glutamine and FGAR, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1581497463,"Abstract Endonuclease I was purified from a lysate of Proteus mirabilis by dihydrostreptomycin sulfate precipitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex, and isoelectric density gradient electrophoresis. Purified endonuclease I sediments as a 3 S molecule and degrades double stranded P. mirabilis chromosomal DNA to acid-soluble products. In the presence of Escherichia coli tRNA the enzyme sediments as 7.2 and 6 S molecular forms and degrades double stranded chromosomal DNA to fragments that sediment as 8 S DNA molecules. The 7.2 and 6 S forms of endonuclease I that can be generated by the addition of tRNA to the purified enzyme also are observed in the dihydrostreptomycin sulfate precipitate of the crude extract of the bacteria. The limited digestion of DNA in vitro to the 8 S fragments is not caused by insufficient enzyme or end product inhibition by the 8 S DNA products. The 8 S DNA fragments also can be extracted from intact P. mirabilis cells grown under certain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1631545961,"Abstract The effect of variation of total CO2 concentration at constant pH on the intermediates of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway and citric acid cycle in the isolated perfused liver has been studied. Total CO2 concentration of the perfusate was changed either from 10 to 34 mm or from 34 to 10 mm at pH 7.40 at the midpoint of 2-hour liver perfusions. In livers perfused with a medium containing 14 mm glycerol and 17 mm glucose, the liver concentration of glucose-6-P, fructose-6-P, fructose diphosphate, pyruvate, malate, and citrate was found to have increased when CO2 concentration was increased, and decreased when CO2 concentration was decreased, in a range of 6 to 59%, when compared to control values. The tissue concentration of 3-P-glycerate, P-enolpyruvate, and aspartate changed in an inverse manner, decreasing and increasing in a range of 12 to 104% as the CO2 concentration of the liver perfusate was increased and decreased, respectively. Livers perfused with a medium to which glucose (5.8 mm) was the only added substrate were found to have generally similar changes in metabolite concentrations with change in CO2 concentration. Citrate and pyruvate concentrations were, however, more markedly altered and the change in malate concentration was opposite in direction, with respect to the change in the CO2 concentration of the perfusate, and greater than that observed when both glycerol (14 mm) and glucose (17 mm) were present in the perfusate. Livers perfused with medium containing the combined higher concentrations of glycerol and glucose had higher absolute levels of glucose-6-P, fructose-6-P, fructose diphosphate, 3-P-glycerate, P-enolpyruvate, and pyruvate and lower malate, aspartate, and citrate concentrations at both CO2 concentrations. The results of this study support the concept that physiological changes in extracellular CO2 concentration markedly alter the concentration of metabolic intermediates associated directly with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism."
