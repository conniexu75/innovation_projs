https://openalex.org/W2013449613,Concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons in airborne dust carried by the trade winds from the European-African land areas to Barbados range from less than 1 to 164 parts per billion. The lower limit of the average content of 1 cubic meter of air is 7.8 x 10-(14) gram. The contributions of river-borne and atmospherically transported pesticides to parts of the marine environment are calculated approximately and comtpared. The amnounts of pesticides contributed to the tropical Atlantic by the trade winds appear to be comparable to those carried to the sea by major river systems.
https://openalex.org/W1551793157,"Abstract Inhibitions of the relatively highly purified flavoenzyme, bovine kidney mitochondrial monoamine oxidase, previously described in Paper I (Erwin, V. G., and Hellerman, L., J. Biol. Chem., 242, 4230 (1967)), by several agents of current interest have been investigated. The inhibitors include N-methyl-N-(2-propynyl)benzylamine (pargyline), (+)-trans-phenylcyclopropylamine (d form of tranylcypromine), as well as various substituted hydrazines including 1-hydrazino-phthalazine (hydralazine) and β-phenylethylhydrazine (phenelzine). With the exception of hydralazine which produced a reversible, substrate-competitive inhibition (Ki, 2 x 10-5 m), the inhibitory hydrazine derivatives investigated caused irreversible inhibitions, differing primarily in the rate of attack on the enzyme; aromatic hydrazines, e.g. phenylhydrazine, were more aggressive than aliphatic hydrazines, e.g. methylhydrazine, members of either class being more active than hydrazides. When graded amounts of arylhydrazine, tranylcypromine, or pargyline were allowed to react with the enzyme, the activity of the enzyme was observed to decrease as a linear function of the amount of inhibitor added; complete inhibition was attained at a ratio of 1 mole of inhibitor per 105 g of protein. It is proposed that these results represent titration at the catalytic site of monoamine oxidase. (+)-Tranylcypromine is known to act as a substrate-competitive inhibitor of monoamine oxidase; for our preparation, Ki was determined as 5.8 x 10-8 m and inhibition was seen to be only partially reversed by dialysis in the presence of substrate. Inhibition by pargyline was not reversible and studies performed with 14C-pargyline (labeled at C-7) indicated that reaction of this inhibitor with monoamine oxidase included ultimate formation of a bond to the flavoenzyme that appeared to be essentially covalent in character. Evidence is presented that suggests that pargyline interacts initially with monoamine oxidase as an electron donor for this flavoenzyme; in a nitrogen atmosphere, reduction of the flavoenzyme by pargyline is followed by or accompanies the irreversible binding step. It was observed that pargyline did not inhibit after the enzyme was first reduced anaerobically with excess benzylamine or with sodium dithionite (followed by addition of benzylamine before the introduction of air). Tranylcypromine, a reversible, nonreducing inhibitor, was found capable of inhibiting the enzyme under such conditions. Analytical determination establishing persistence of approximately 8 sulfhydryl residue equivalents per 105 g of protein in the enzyme initially inhibited by either pargyline or phenylhydrazine (identical with the sulfhydryl content of the native enzyme in our uninhibited preparation) established that these compounds had not effected inhibition of monoamine oxidase through a process involving irreversible interaction with these protein sulfhydryl residues. A mechanism for inhibition of monoamine oxidase by pargyline is proposed. Evidence is cited suggesting that the catalytic mechanism for mitochondrial monoamine oxidase follows a pattern closely related to the mechanism (Neims, A. H., De Luca, D. C., and Hellerman, L., Biochemistry, 5, 203 (1966); Hellerman, L., and Coffey, D. S., J. Biol. Chem., 242, 582 (1967)) recently proposed for the enzyme, d-amino acid oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1979661259,The rate at which (3)H-norepinephrine disappears from rat braint increases after gonadectomy; the effect is observed 6 days after the operation and 24 hours after introduiction of the labeled mnaterial; it is not reprodluced by hypophysectomy. The content of endogenouis brain norepinephrinie does not decline after removal of the ovaries or testes; thus synlthesis of the catecholamine is probably increased by these procedures.
https://openalex.org/W1497402290,"Conditions have been described for the observation of the efflux of amino acids from the Ehrlich cell as a function of concentration. Failure to use very large volumes of suspending medium gives rise to confusion between factors influencing exodus and those affecting re-entry. The neutral and cationic amino acids that enter this cell by specific mediated transport show net exodus from the cell by routes with patterns of analogue inhibition similar to those for their entry. Two model amino acids whose entry is specific each to a different mediating system do not show significant interaction for exodus. Phenylalanine escapes partly by a route inhibitable by one of these models, partly by a route inhibitable by the other. Alanine exodus appears to divide itself among the systems serving principally for its entry, although in somewhat different proportions. The competition for entry shown between lysine and substrates of the L system is also seen for exodus, with indications that a portion of the exodus of lysine escapes that inhibition, as is the case for entry. The apparent Km values for exodus are in general much higher than those for entry, whereas the Vmax values for the two directions are similar. A component of exodus of neutral α-amino acids with a relative rate of slightly less than 0.03 min−1 appears not to be subject to saturation, in correspondence to the magnitude of a similar component of entry. Little or no reactivity for alanine exodus by countertransport has been found except by one of two Na+-dependent systems."

https://openalex.org/W1567525073,"Abstract A new preparative procedure for bovine milk xanthine oxidase avoids exposure of the enzyme to proteases. The enzyme so obtained exhibited a molecular weight of about 300,000 as did chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase. The former readily yielded species with a molecular weight of 150,000 in guanidine and in acid but could not be resolved into smaller subunits. Aldehyde oxidase of rabbit liver exhibited a molecular weight of 275,000 and again deaggregated into molecules of about half that size in guanidine and in acid but was not further deaggregated. Dihydroorotic dehydrogenase has a molecular weight of 112,000 to 124,000 and deaggregated into 4 identical subunit molecules in guanidine solution. The major features of the optical rotatory dispersion spectra of xanthine oxidase were associated with the large absorption peaks due to its flavin and iron complexes and were abolished by the procedures which led to deaggregation into subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2018805476,Immunoglobulin M rabbit antibodies to a hapten are shown to have ten binding sites per molecule. The affinity for the specific hapten is approximately 100 times greater for one-half of the sites than for the other half. All sites are retained in the five 7S subunits produced by reduction and alkylation of the immunoglobulin M. Each of the 7S subunits of the IgM molecule apparently has one strong and one weak site.
https://openalex.org/W1568133411,"Abstract The β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A cleavage enzyme has been obtained in a highly purified but unstable form from bovine liver. A study of the stoichiometry of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction indicated that equimolar amounts of acetoacetate and acetyl coenzyme A are formed, and that only half the synthetically prepared substrate undergoes cleavage. From a consideration of this and other metabolic reactions in which β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A participates, it is concluded that, of the two possible diastereomers, only the one having the S configuration at the β carbon atom is active. The enzyme exhibits an absolute requirement for a divalent metal and a thiol (dithiothreitol, cysteine, or glutathione), and preincubation with the thiol is necessary for optimal initial reaction rates. The Km of the active isomer of the substrate is 8.0 x 10-6 m with Mg++ ions present, and 1.2 x 10-5 m with Co++ ions. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme is 48,000, and the turnover number at 37° and pH 9.5 (the optimal pH) is 3,600 moles per mole of enzyme per min."
https://openalex.org/W1626371877,"Abstract Kinetic data have been obtained concerning model interactions of partially purified monoamine oxidase preparations prepared from human liver mitochondria with the use of Triton X-100 or sonic treatment. The effect of pH upon apparent Michaelis and inhibitor constants of benzylamines and n-alkylamines indicates that the nonprotonated species of these substrates are bound by the enzyme. Ammonia competitively inhibits the enzyme. Primary aliphatic alcohols, which are electronic analogues of nonprotonated monoamines, are also competitive inhibitors. Alcohol inhibitor constants do not vary with pH. The inhibitory effects of mixtures of ammonia and benzyl alcohol suggest that hydroxy and amino groups of interactants are bound at the same enzyme site. The affinities of both the n-alkylamine substrates and the l-hydroxy-n-alkane inhibitors for the enzyme depend upon the number of methylene residues in these interactants. The effects of the chain lengths of the n-alkylamines and the alcohol analogues upon enzyme affinities are remarkably similar. In the case of both types of l-substituted n-alkanes with less than 6 methylene residues, the contribution of each methylene residue to the change in standard free energy that determines the alkane-enzyme complex at 25° is constant and amounts to - 1.3 kcal per mole. We interpret these data as evidence that the enzyme active center contains both electrophilic and hydrophobic binding sites. Substrate inhibitions observed with high concentrations of benzylamine and n-butylamine are consistent with this hypothesis. The kinetic data obtained with Triton X-100 preparations agree with data obtained with sonically treated preparations. We were unable to detect discrepancies in the kinetic data of either preparation, which might have suggested the presence of multiple monoamine oxidase activities. On the other hand, the mitochondrial activity differed in several respects from that of the monoamine oxidase of human plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1596513110,"Abstract A rapidly labeled 45 S ribonucleoprotein complex has been isolated and characterized from purified rat liver nuclei. The chemical and physical characterization of the nuclear RNA-protein complex revealed the following properties. (a) An RNA component that was identified as messenger RNA on the basis of rapid incorporation of RNA precursors, molecular wieght, nucleotide base composition, and RNA-DNA hybridization. (b) A protein component, distinct from ribosomal proteins or histones with respect to its electrophoretic properties. (c) An RNA-protein complex different from ribosomal subunits with respect to its structural organization and its nucleic acid to protein ratio. These studies suggest that the 45 S ribonucleoprotein complex does not represent a precursor to cytoplasmic ribosomal subunits but represents a complex of newly synthesized mRNA and specific nuclear proteins. The formation of such a specific mRNA-protein complex within the nucleus could provide a mechanism for the release of mRNA from its DNA template, or the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, or both."

https://openalex.org/W1493741720,"Abstract The molecular properties of cytochrome c2 isolated from light grown cells of the facultative photoanaerobe, Rhodospirillum rubrum, are described as evaluated after final purification by isoelectric fractionation. The protein was found to consist of a single polypeptide chain comprising 112 amino acid residues, with freely available glutamic acid and lysine marking the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal positions, respectively. Based on the presence of a single protoheme IX, a formula weight of 12,840 was obtained. The distinctively different physiological and physicochemical properties of this c-type cytochrome, as compared to mammalian cytochromes c, are discussed. The peptides resulting from digestion of the protein by trypsin and by thermolysin were isolated and purified; their compositions and amino acid sequences are presented in several tables. Extensive application of the Edman degradation to these peptides, together with positive identification of the resulting phenylthiohydantoins, afforded direct evidence for all sequence assignments within the peptides obtained. The advantages and disadvantages of hydrolysis by trypsin and thermolysin as applied to cytochrome c2 are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1533445116,"Abstract Ribosomal preparations isolated from rat cerebral cortex exhibited basal amino acid-incorporating activities comparable to those observed with the analogous preparations from rat liver. In each instance, polyribosomes larger than the tetramer were most active in protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro. However, following the initial incorporation of radioactive amino acids into heavy polyribosomes, a substantial portion of the radioactivity incorporated became associated with the lighter ribosomal species in the cerebral but not in the hepatic systems. Cerebral ribosomal preparations contained a smaller proportion of heavy polyribosomes than the corresponding hepatic ribosomes. These cerebral polyribosomes dissociated more rapidly than hepatic polyribosomes during incubation in amino acid-incorporating systems. Under these conditions, disruption of cerebral polyribosomes was accompanied by greatly accentuated incorporation of phenylalanine in response to polyuridylic acid. Nevertheless, the cerebral systems uniformly contained significantly lower ribonuclease activities than the corresponding hepatic preparations. Moreover, cerebral polyribosomes exhibited greater sensitivity to disruption than hepatic polyribosomes in the presence of low concentrations of pancreatic ribonuclease or Mg2+. The data support the concept that certain cerebral messenger RNA-ribosome complexes are unusually labile. The possible relationship of these findings to the specialized biological functions of the central nervous system is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W161898954,"Abstract The time course of the appearance of rapid hemoglobin, as judged by the results of partial photodissociation of carbon monoxide, was followed with a stopped-flow flash photolysis apparatus. Deoxyhemoglobin was mixed with carbon monoxide and a photolysis flash was fired after a short accurately measured time interval. There is a marked lag in the appearance of rapid hemoglobin. Analysis of the results suggests that this is not due to a first order process following ligand binding. The lag cannot, therefore, be due to dissociation of hemoglobin into subunits or to loss of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The results appear to be incompatible with schemes having the dimer as the prime unit of function. It is proposed that the change in reactivity associated with the appearance of rapid hemoglobin occurs after at least three ligand molecules have combined. This conclusion is supported by experiments with the hybrid species αNOβCO which behaves as a functional tetramer. The time course of the appearance of rapid hemoglobin was not significantly influenced by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate."

https://openalex.org/W1538281610,"Abstract The effect of 38 structural analogues of AMP on glycogen phosphorylase b has been studied in order to determine which functional groups or atoms of AMP are important for the binding to and activation of the enzyme. Among the compounds tested, 21 were activators, and the mode of interaction was analyzed kinetically in terms of the maximal activation and the activation constant which was the concentration giving a half-maximal activation. With 12 compounds, which did not activate the enzyme but counteracted the activation by AMP, the inhibition constant against the activation was determined for the evaluation of the binding capacity. The results indicated the following: The amino group at position 6 and the nitrogen atom at position 1 were effective in the binding; the hydroxyl group at position 2 of the ribose moiety contributed both to the binding and to the activation, while the hydroxyl group at position 3 did not; the monophosphate group was absolutely required and should be located at position 5 of the ribose moiety for the activation."

https://openalex.org/W2043550026,"The Vinca alkaloids vinblastine sulfate and vincrystine sulfate, which are mitotic poisons, inhibit RNA synthesis in human (HEp-2) cells cultured in vitro. Analyses of RNA synthesis by cells treated with these drugs by acrylamide gel electrophoresis show that 28s rRNA and to a lesser extent 18s rRNA are preferentially inhibited. The synthesis of tRNA is affected much less than that of rRNA. The present experiments suggest that the drugs inhibit both the synthesis and processing of the nucleolar RNA precursors of rRNA. An explanation is also given for previous reports that these alkaloids preferentially inhibit the synthesis of tRNA in animal cells in vitro."
