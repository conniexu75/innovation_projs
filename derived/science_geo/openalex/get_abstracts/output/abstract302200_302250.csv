The frequencies of the oscillations have already provided measures of the sound speed and the rate of rotation throughout much of the solar interior. These quantities are important for understanding the dynamics of the magnetic cycle and have a bearing on testing general relativity by planetary precession. The oscillation frequencies yield a helium abundance that is consistent with cosmology, but they reinforce the severity of the neutrino problem. They should soon provide an important standard by which to calibrate the theory of stellar evolution."

Daily averages were linearly related to the local wind power. When integrated over the depth range of 10 to 110 meters, the dissipation was 10.6 ergs per square centimeter per second or 0.92 +/- 0.10 percent of the wind power, a proportion not substantially different from those found in mid-latitude surface mixed layers. These results suggest that much of the energy dissipated above the equatorial undercurrent may be extracted directly from the local wind."

Studies with a three-dimensional global atmospheric circulation model showed that heating of the smoke by sunlight would be important and might produce several effects that would decrease the efficiency with which precipitation removes smoke from the atmosphere. The heating gives rise to vertical motions that carry smoke well above the original injection height. Heating of the smoke also causes the tropopause, which is initially above the smoke, to reform below the heated smoke layer. Smoke above the tropopause is physically isolated from precipitation below. Consequently, the atmospheric residence time of the remaining smoke is greatly increased over the prescribed residence times used in previous models of nuclear winter."

The experimental effects of this organism, while in the filterable state, upon rabbits, is discussed. 2. A procedure is formulated for inducing at will both a filterable and a non-filterable state in bacteria. Mention is made of a series of experiments in which both the filterable and the non-filterable state has thus been induced in a series of well-known bacteria comprising a variety of types. 3. It is postulated that a majority, if not all, known bacteria can and do exist in a filterable and in a non-filterable state. 4. A preliminary report of the isolation of microbes in the blood, not only of cases of influenza, but also from common cold, rheumatic fever, arthritis, from Staphylococcus bacteriophage and Besredka's Staphylococcus Antivirus is presented in evidence of the ubiquity of the procedure. 5. An explanation of the chemical basis for the existence of bacteria, both in the filterable and non-filterable states, in the animal and human body, and in culture, is proferred. 6. The relation of this chemical concept to microbic infection, and the state of microbes in the body during infection is discussed. In conclusion, it is a privilege as well as a pleasure to inscribe here my appreciation for the courteous cooperation of Dean Irving S. Cutter, Doctors Charles A. Elliott, Paul Starr, James G. Carr, Walter Nadler, Howard Alt and Herbert Barker, of the department of medicine, and to Northwestern University for the generous facilities and unrestricted opportunity for research which have contributed immeasurably to this investigation."

https://openalex.org/W1993288387,"The arrest of British, French, Swedish and American paleontologic and archeologic work in Central Asia constitutes a very serious setback to the cause of science and of civilization. The matter would not be so serious if there were any possibility or prospect of the present ability of the Chinese to carry out this work themselves. They have neither the scholarship nor the financial means of doing so beyond the confines of old China. The American Museum geologic, paleontologic and stratigraphic and topographic work in Mongolia and the great publications issuing therefrom have been possible only because the party was composed of a body of field experts such as has never been brought together before in the history of these branches of science, under a leader who has shown unprecedented ability to organize a series of expeditions into an absolutely unknown desert where all previous explorers had failed either to make discoveries or obtain substantial results."
