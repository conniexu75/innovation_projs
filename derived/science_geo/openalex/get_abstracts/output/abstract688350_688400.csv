https://openalex.org/W4210511145,"Abstract The cardiovascular complications of acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are well described, but the post-acute cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 have not yet been comprehensively characterized. Here we used national healthcare databases from the US Department of Veterans Affairs to build a cohort of 153,760 individuals with COVID-19, as well as two sets of control cohorts with 5,637,647 (contemporary controls) and 5,859,411 (historical controls) individuals, to estimate risks and 1-year burdens of a set of pre-specified incident cardiovascular outcomes. We show that, beyond the first 30 d after infection, individuals with COVID-19 are at increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease spanning several categories, including cerebrovascular disorders, dysrhythmias, ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, heart failure and thromboembolic disease. These risks and burdens were evident even among individuals who were not hospitalized during the acute phase of the infection and increased in a graded fashion according to the care setting during the acute phase (non-hospitalized, hospitalized and admitted to intensive care). Our results provide evidence that the risk and 1-year burden of cardiovascular disease in survivors of acute COVID-19 are substantial. Care pathways of those surviving the acute episode of COVID-19 should include attention to cardiovascular health and disease."

We have previously shown that the disialoganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on H3K27M-mutated glioma cells and have demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy of GD2-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells2, providing the rationale for a first-in-human phase I clinical trial (NCT04196413). Because CAR T cell-induced brainstem inflammation can result in obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure and dangerous tissue shifts, neurocritical care precautions were incorporated. Here we present the clinical experience from the first four patients with H3K27M-mutated DIPG or spinal cord DMG treated with GD2-CAR T cells at dose level 1 (1 Ã— 106 GD2-CAR T cells per kg administered intravenously). Patients who exhibited clinical benefit were eligible for subsequent GD2-CAR T cell infusions administered intracerebroventricularly3. Toxicity was largely related to the location of the tumour and was reversible with intensive supportive care. On-target, off-tumour toxicity was not observed. Three of four patients exhibited clinical and radiographic improvement. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were increased in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Transcriptomic analyses of 65,598 single cells from CAR T cell products and cerebrospinal fluid elucidate heterogeneity in response between participants and administration routes. These early results underscore the promise of this therapeutic approach for patients with H3K27M-mutated DIPG or spinal cord DMG."
https://openalex.org/W4210943449,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant has become the dominant infective strain. We report the structures of the Omicron spike trimer on its own and in complex with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or an anti-Omicron antibody. Most Omicron mutations are located on the surface of the spike protein and change binding epitopes to many current antibodies. In the ACE2-binding site, compensating mutations strengthen receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to ACE2. Both the RBD and the apo form of the Omicron spike trimer are thermodynamically unstable. An unusual RBD-RBD interaction in the ACE2-spike complex supports the open conformation and further reinforces ACE2 binding to the spike trimer. A broad-spectrum therapeutic antibody, JMB2002, which has completed a phase 1 clinical trial, maintains neutralizing activity against Omicron. JMB2002 binds to RBD differently from other characterized antibodies and inhibits ACE2 binding."
https://openalex.org/W4210917455,"Epidural electrical stimulation (EES) targeting the dorsal roots of lumbosacral segments restores walking in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, EES is delivered with multielectrode paddle leads that were originally designed to target the dorsal column of the spinal cord. Here, we hypothesized that an arrangement of electrodes targeting the ensemble of dorsal roots involved in leg and trunk movements would result in superior efficacy, restoring more diverse motor activities after the most severe SCI. To test this hypothesis, we established a computational framework that informed the optimal arrangement of electrodes on a new paddle lead and guided its neurosurgical positioning. We also developed software supporting the rapid configuration of activity-specific stimulation programs that reproduced the natural activation of motor neurons underlying each activity. We tested these neurotechnologies in three individuals with complete sensorimotor paralysis as part of an ongoing clinical trial ( www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02936453). Within a single day, activity-specific stimulation programs enabled these three individuals to stand, walk, cycle, swim and control trunk movements. Neurorehabilitation mediated sufficient improvement to restore these activities in community settings, opening a realistic path to support everyday mobility with EES in people with SCI."
https://openalex.org/W4210752017,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated a clear need for high-throughput, multiplexed and sensitive assays for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other respiratory viruses and their emerging variants. Here, we present a cost-effective virus and variant detection platform, called microfluidic Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (mCARMEN), which combines CRISPR-based diagnostics and microfluidics with a streamlined workflow for clinical use. We developed the mCARMEN respiratory virus panel to test for up to 21 viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses and both influenza strains, and demonstrated its diagnostic-grade performance on 525 patient specimens in an academic setting and 166 specimens in a clinical setting. We further developed an mCARMEN panel to enable the identification of 6 SARS-CoV-2 variant lineages, including Delta and Omicron, and evaluated it on 2,088 patient specimens with near-perfect concordance to sequencing-based variant classification. Lastly, we implemented a combined Cas13 and Cas12 approach that enables quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A viral copies in samples. The mCARMEN platform enables high-throughput surveillance of multiple viruses and variants simultaneously, enabling rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants."
https://openalex.org/W4210689197,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 261 million people and has led to more than 5 million deaths in the past year and a half1 ( https://www.who.org/ ). Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection typically develop mild-to-severe flu-like symptoms, whereas infection of a subset of individuals leads to severe-to-fatal clinical outcomes2. Although vaccines have been rapidly developed to combat SARS-CoV-2, there has been a dearth of antiviral therapeutics. There is an urgent need for therapeutics, which has been amplified by the emerging threats of variants that may evade vaccines. Large-scale efforts are underway to identify antiviral drugs. Here we screened approximately 18,000 drugs for antiviral activity using live virus infection in human respiratory cells and validated 122 drugs with antiviral activity and selectivity against SARS-CoV-2. Among these candidates are 16 nucleoside analogues, the largest category of clinically used antivirals. This included the antivirals remdesivir and molnupiravir, which have been approved for use in COVID-19. RNA viruses rely on a high supply of nucleoside triphosphates from the host to efficiently replicate, and we identified a panel of host nucleoside biosynthesis inhibitors as antiviral. Moreover, we found that combining pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors with antiviral nucleoside analogues synergistically inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo against emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a clinical path forward. A combination of pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors and antiviral nucleoside analogues can boost the antiviral effect of nucleoside analogues against SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W4225590988,"The unprecedented rise in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections during December 2021 was concurrent with rapid spread of the Omicron variant in England and globally. We analyzed the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and its dynamics in England from the end of November to mid-December 2021 among almost 100,000 participants in the REACT-1 study. Prevalence was high with rapid growth nationally and particularly in London during December 2021, with an increasing proportion of infections due to Omicron. We observed large decreases in swab positivity among mostly vaccinated older children (12 to 17 years) relative to unvaccinated younger children (5 to 11 years), and in adults who received a third (booster) vaccine dose versus two doses. Our results reinforce the importance of vaccination and booster campaigns, although additional measures have been needed to control the rapid growth of the Omicron variant."
https://openalex.org/W4210887696,"The repetitive nature and complexity of some medically relevant genes poses a challenge for their accurate analysis in a clinical setting. The Genome in a Bottle Consortium has provided variant benchmark sets, but these exclude nearly 400 medically relevant genes due to their repetitiveness or polymorphic complexity. Here, we characterize 273 of these 395 challenging autosomal genes using a haplotype-resolved whole-genome assembly. This curated benchmark reports over 17,000 single-nucleotide variations, 3,600 insertions and deletions and 200 structural variations each for human genome reference GRCh37 and GRCh38 across HG002. We show that false duplications in either GRCh37 or GRCh38 result in reference-specific, missed variants for short- and long-read technologies in medically relevant genes, including CBS, CRYAA and KCNE1. When masking these false duplications, variant recall can improve from 8% to 100%. Forming benchmarks from a haplotype-resolved whole-genome assembly may become a prototype for future benchmarks covering the whole genome. Variant detection in problematic genes is facilitated with a curated benchmark."
https://openalex.org/W4221108904,"Classical models of perceptual decision-making assume that subjects use a single, consistent strategy to form decisions, or that decision-making strategies evolve slowly over time. Here we present new analyses suggesting that this common view is incorrect. We analyzed data from mouse and human decision-making experiments and found that choice behavior relies on an interplay among multiple interleaved strategies. These strategies, characterized by states in a hidden Markov model, persist for tens to hundreds of trials before switching, and often switch multiple times within a session. The identified decision-making strategies were highly consistent across mice and comprised a single 'engaged' state, in which decisions relied heavily on the sensory stimulus, and several biased states in which errors frequently occurred. These results provide a powerful alternate explanation for 'lapses' often observed in rodent behavioral experiments, and suggest that standard measures of performance mask the presence of major changes in strategy across trials."
https://openalex.org/W4210915535,"Cell-free RNA from liquid biopsies can be analyzed to determine disease tissue of origin. We extend this concept to identify cell types of origin using the Tabula Sapiens transcriptomic cell atlas as well as individual tissue transcriptomic cell atlases in combination with the Human Protein Atlas RNA consensus dataset. We define cell type signature scores, which allow the inference of cell types that contribute to cell-free RNA for a variety of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4210895143,"How multiple epigenetic layers and transcription factors (TFs) interact to facilitate brain development is largely unknown. Here, to systematically map the regulatory landscape of neural differentiation in the mouse neocortex, we profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility in single cells and integrated these data with measurements of enhancer activity, DNA methylation and three-dimensional genome architecture in purified cell populations. This allowed us to identify thousands of new enhancers, their predicted target genes and the temporal relationships between enhancer activation, epigenome remodeling and gene expression. We characterize specific neuronal transcription factors associated with extensive and frequently coordinated changes across multiple epigenetic modalities. In addition, we functionally demonstrate a new role for Neurog2 in directly mediating enhancer activity, DNA demethylation, increasing chromatin accessibility and facilitating chromatin looping in vivo. Our work provides a global view of the gene regulatory logic of lineage specification in the cerebral cortex."
https://openalex.org/W4210848411,"Globally, a lower income is associated with poorer health status and reduced quality of life (QOL). However, more research is needed on how being older may influence QOL in lower-income households, particularly as older age is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases and care needs. To this end, the current study attempts to determine the health-related QOL (HRQOL) among individuals from lower-income households aged 60 years and over compared to lower-income adults aged less than 60 years.Participants were identified from the Department of Statistics Malaysia sampling frame. Surveys were carried out with individual households aged 18 years and older through self-administered questionnaires. Information was collected on demographics, household income, employment status, number of diseases, and HRQOL assessed using the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) tool.Out of a total of 1899 participants, 620 (32.6%) were female and 328 (17.3%) were aged 60 years and above. The mean (SD) age was 45.2 (14.1) and mean (SD) household income was RM2124 (1356). Compared with younger individuals, older respondents were more likely to experience difficulties in mobility (32.1% vs 9.7%, p<0.001), self-care (11.6% vs 3.8%, p<0.001), usual activities (24.5% vs 9.1%, p<0.001), pain/discomfort (38.8% vs 16.5%, p<0.001) and anxiety/depression (21.4% vs 13.5%, p<0.001). The mean (SD) EQ-5D index scores were lower among older respondents, 0.89 (0.16) vs 0.95 (0.13), p = 0.001. After adjusting for covariates, age was a significant influencing factor (p = 0.001) for mobility (OR = 2.038, 95% CI:1.439-2.885), usual activities (OR = 1.957, 95% CI:1.353-2.832) and pain or discomfort (OR = 2.241, 95% CI:1.690-2.972).Lower-income older adults had poorer HRQOL compared to their younger counterparts. This has important implications concerning intervention strategies that incorporate active ageing concepts on an individual and policy-making level to enhance the QOL and wellbeing, particularly among the older lower-income population."
https://openalex.org/W4210924745,"A growing body of research has reported on the potential opioid-sparing effects of cannabis and cannabinoids, but less is known about specific mechanisms. The present research examines cannabis-related posts in two large online communities on the Reddit platform (""subreddits"") to compare mentions of naturalistic cannabis use by persons self-identifying as actively using opioids versus persons in recovery. We extracted all posts mentioning cannabis-related keywords (e.g., ""weed"", ""cannabis"", ""marijuana"") from December 2015 through August 2019 from an opioid use subreddit and an opioid recovery subreddit. To investigate how cannabis is discussed at-scale, we identified and compared the most frequent phrases in cannabis-related posts in each subreddit using term-frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting. To contextualize these findings, we also conducted a qualitative content analysis of 200 random posts (100 from each subreddit). Cannabis-related posts were about twice as prevalent in the recovery subreddit (n = 908; 5.4% of 16,791 posts) than in the active opioid use subreddit (n = 4,224; 2.6% of 159,994 posts, p < .001). The most frequent phrases from the recovery subreddit referred to time without using opioids and the possibility of using cannabis as a ""treatment."" The most frequent phrases from the opioid subreddit referred to concurrent use of cannabis and opioids. The most common motivations for using cannabis were to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms in the recovery subreddit, often in conjunction with anti-anxiety and GI-distress ""comfort meds,"" and to enhance the ""high"" when used in combination with opioids in the opioid subreddit. Despite limitations in generalizability from pseudonymous online posts, this examination of reports of naturalistic cannabis use in relation to opioid use identified withdrawal symptom management as a common motivation. Future research is warranted with more structured assessments that examines the role of cannabis and cannabinoids in addressing both somatic and affective symptoms of opioid withdrawal."
https://openalex.org/W4210323662,"Trop-2 is a transmembrane signal transducer that is overexpressed in most human cancers, and drives malignant progression. To gain knowledge on the higher-order molecular mechanisms that drive Trop-2 signaling, we applied next-generation sequencing, proteomics, and high-resolution microscopy to models and primary cases of human colorectal cancer (CRC). We had previously shown that Trop-2 induces a Ca2+ signal. We reveal here that Trop-2 binds the cell membrane Na+/K+-ATPase, and that clustering of Trop-2 induces an intracellular Ca2+ rise followed by membrane translocation of PKCÎ±, which in turn phosphorylates the Trop-2 cytoplasmic tail. This feed-forward signaling is promoted by the binding of Trop-2 to the PKCÎ± membrane-anchor CD9. CRISPR-based inactivation of CD9 in CRC cells shows that CD9 is required by Trop-2 for recruiting PKCÎ± and cofilin-1 to the cell membrane. This induces malignant progression through proteolytic cleavage of E-cadherin, remodeling of the Î²-actin cytoskeleton, and activation of Akt and ERK. The interaction between Trop-2 and CD9 was validated in vivo in murine models of CRC growth and invasion. Overexpression of the components of this Trop-2-driven super-complex significantly worsened disease-free and overall survival of CRC patients, supporting a pivotal relevance in CRC malignant progression. Our findings demonstrate a previously unsuspected layer of cancer growth regulation, which is dormant in normal tissues, and is activated by Trop-2 in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W4210788873,"Most mammalian phospholipids contain a saturated fatty acid at the sn-1 carbon atom and an unsaturated fatty acid at the sn-2 carbon atom of the glycerol backbone group. While the sn-2 linked chains undergo extensive remodeling by deacylation and reacylation (Lands cycle), it is not known how the composition of saturated fatty acids is controlled at the sn-1 position. Here, we demonstrate that lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (LPGAT1) is an sn-1 specific acyltransferase that controls the stearate/palmitate ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine. Bacterially expressed murine LPGAT1 transferred saturated acyl-CoAs specifically into the sn-1 position of lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) rather than lysophosphatidylglycerol and preferred stearoyl-CoA over palmitoyl-CoA as the substrate. In addition, genetic ablation of LPGAT1 in mice abolished 1-LPE:stearoyl-CoA acyltransferase activity and caused a shift from stearate to palmitate species in PE, dimethyl-PE, and phosphatidylcholine. Lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase 1 KO mice were leaner and had a shorter life span than their littermate controls. Finally, we show that total lipid synthesis was reduced in isolated hepatocytes of LPGAT1 knockout mice. Thus, we conclude that LPGAT1 is an sn-1 specific LPE acyltransferase that controls the stearate/palmitate homeostasis of PE and the metabolites of the PE methylation pathway and that LPGAT1 plays a central role in the regulation of lipid biosynthesis with implications for body fat content and longevity."
https://openalex.org/W4210861900,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a fatal disease, and its metastatic process is poorly understood. Although aberrant methylation is involved in tumor progression, the mechanisms underlying dynamic DNA methylation remain to be elucidated. It is significant to study the molecular mechanism of NSCLC metastasis and identify new biomarkers for NSCLC early diagnosis. Here, we performed MeDIP-seq and hMeDIP-seq analyses to detect the genes regulated by dynamic DNA methylation. Comparison of the 5mC and 5hmC sites revealed that the CD147 gene underwent active demethylation in NSCLC tissues compared with normal tissues, and this demethylation upregulated CD147 expression. Significantly high levels of CD147 expression and low levels of promoter methylation were observed in NSCLC tissues. Then, we identified the CD147 promoter as a target of KLF6, MeCP2, and DNMT3A. Treatment of cells with TGF-Î² triggered active demethylation involving loss of KLF6/MeCP2/DNMT3A and recruitment of Sp1, Tet1, TDG, and SMAD2/3 transcription complexes. A dCas9-SunTag-DNMAT3A-sgCD147-targeted methylation system was constructed to reverse CD147 expression. The targeted methylation system downregulated CD147 expression and inhibited NSCLC proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, we used cfDNA to detect the levels of CD147 methylation in NSCLC tissues and found that the CD147 methylation levels exhibited an inverse relationship with tumor size, lymphatic metastasis, and TNM stage. In conclusion, this study clarified the mechanism of active demethylation of CD147 and suggested that the targeted methylation of CD147 could inhibit NSCLC invasion and metastasis, providing a highly promising therapeutic target for NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W4210875780,"Genomic surveillance empowers agile responses to SARS-CoV-2 by enabling scientists and public health analysts to issue recommendations aimed at slowing transmission, prioritizing contact tracing, and building a robust genomic sequencing surveillance strategy. Since the start of the pandemic, real time RT-PCR diagnostic testing from upper respiratory specimens, such as nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, has been the standard. Moreover, respiratory samples in viral transport media are the ideal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In early 2021, many clinicians transitioned to antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tests, which use anterior nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. Despite this shift in testing methods, the need for whole-genome sequence surveillance remains. Thus, we developed a workflow for whole-genome sequencing with antigen test-derived swabs as an input rather than nasopharyngeal swabs. In this study, we use excess clinical specimens processed using the BinaxNOWâ„¢ COVID-19 Ag Card. We demonstrate that whole-genome sequencing from antigen tests is feasible and yields similar results from RT-PCR-based assays utilizing a swab in viral transport media."
https://openalex.org/W4210873682,"Narrowing the communication and knowledge gap between producers and users of scientific data is a longstanding problem in ecological conservation and land management. Decision support tools (DSTs), including websites or interactive web applications, provide platforms that can help bridge this gap. DSTs can most effectively disseminate and translate research results when producers and users collaboratively and iteratively design content and features. One data resource seldom incorporated into DSTs are species distribution models (SDMs), which can produce spatial predictions of habitat suitability. Outputs from SDMs can inform management decisions, but their complexity and inaccessibility can limit their use by resource managers or policy makers. To overcome these limitations, we present the Invasive Species Habitat Tool (INHABIT), a novel, web-based DST built with R Shiny to display spatial predictions and tabular summaries of habitat suitability from SDMs for invasive plants across the contiguous United States. INHABIT provides actionable science to support the prevention and management of invasive species. Two case studies demonstrate the important role of end user feedback in confirming INHABIT's credibility, utility, and relevance."
https://openalex.org/W4210939040,"Urban growth and decline occur every year and show changes in urban areas. Although various approaches to detect urban changes have been developed, they mainly use large-scale satellite imagery and socioeconomic factors in urban areas, which provides an overview of urban changes. However, since people explore places and notice changes daily at the street level, it would be useful to develop a method to identify urban changes at the street level and demonstrate whether urban growth or decline occurs there. Thus, this study seeks to use street-level panoramic images from Google Street View to identify urban changes and to develop a new way to evaluate the growth and decline of an urban area. After collecting Google Street View images year by year, we trained and developed a deep-learning model of an object detection process using the open-source software TensorFlow. By scoring objects and changes detected on a street from year to year, a map of urban growth and decline was generated for Midtown in Detroit, Michigan, USA. By comparing socioeconomic changes and the situations of objects and changes in Midtown, the proposed method is shown to be helpful for analyzing urban growth and decline by using year-by-year street view images."
https://openalex.org/W4210933237,"Insect immune responses to multiple pathogen groups including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and entomopathogenic nematodes have traditionally been documented in model insects such as Drosophila melanogaster, or medically important insects such as Aedes aegypti. Despite their potential importance in understanding the efficacy of pathogens as biological control agents, these responses are infrequently studied in agriculturally important pests. Additionally, studies that investigate responses of a host species to different pathogen groups are uncommon, and typically focus on only a single time point during infection. As such, a robust understanding of immune system responses over the time of infection is often lacking in many pest species. This study was conducted to understand how 3rd instar larvae of the major insect pest Helicoverpa zea responded through the course of an infection by four different pathogenic groups: viruses, bacteria, fungi, and entomopathogenic nematodes; by sampling at three different times post-inoculation. Physiological immune responses were assessed at 4-, 24-, and 48-hours post-infection by measuring hemolymph phenoloxidase concentrations, hemolymph prophenoloxidase concentrations, hemocyte counts, and encapsulation ability. Transcriptional immune responses were measured at 24-, 48-, and 72-hours post-infection by quantifying the expression of PPO2, Argonaute-2, JNK, Dorsal, and Relish. This gene set covers the major known immune pathways: phenoloxidase cascade, siRNA, JNK pathway, Toll pathway, and IMD pathway. Our results indicate H. zea has an extreme immune response to Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a mild response to Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus, and little-to-no detectable response to either the fungus Beauveria bassiana or Steinernema carpocapsae nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W4210898176,"Objective To assess the accuracy of principal investigatorsâ€™ (PIs) predictions about three events for their own clinical trials: positivity on trial primary outcomes, successful recruitment and timely trial completion. Study design and setting A short, electronic survey was used to elicit subjective probabilities within seven months of trial registration. When trial results became available, prediction skill was calculated using Brier scores (BS) and compared against uninformative prediction (i.e. predicting 50% all of the time). Results 740 PIs returned surveys (16.7% response rate). Predictions on all three events tended to exceed observed event frequency. Averaged PI skill did not surpass uninformative predictions (e.g., BS = 0.25) for primary outcomes (BS = 0.25, 95% CI 0.20, 0.30) and were significantly worse for recruitment and timeline predictions (BS 0.38, 95% CI 0.33, 0.42; BS = 0.52, 95% CI 0.50, 0.55, respectively). PIs showed poor calibration for primary outcome, recruitment, and timelines (calibration index = 0.064, 0.150 and 0.406, respectively), modest discrimination in primary outcome predictions (AUC = 0.76, 95% CI 0.65, 0.85) but minimal discrimination in the other two outcomes (AUC = 0.64, 95% CI 0.57, 0.70; and 0.55, 95% CI 0.47, 0.62, respectively). Conclusion PIs showed overconfidence in favorable outcomes and exhibited limited skill in predicting scientific or operational outcomes for their own trials. They nevertheless showed modest ability to discriminate between positive and non-positive trial outcomes. Low survey response rates may limit generalizability."
https://openalex.org/W3187903793,"Deep learning increasingly accelerates biomedical research, deploying neural networks for multiple tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, neural networks are commonly trained supervised on large-scale, labeled datasets. These prerequisites raise issues in biomedical image recognition, as datasets are generally small-scale, challenging to obtain, expensive to label, and frequently heterogeneously labeled. Furthermore, heterogeneous labels are a challenge for supervised methods. If not all classes are labeled for an individual sample, supervised deep learning approaches can only learn on a subset of the dataset with common labels for each individual sample; consequently, biomedical image recognition engineers need to be frugal concerning their label and ground truth requirements. This paper discusses the effects of frugal labeling and proposes to train neural networks for multi-class semantic segmentation on heterogeneously labeled data based on a novel objective function. The objective function combines a class asymmetric loss with the Dice loss. The approach is demonstrated for training on the sparse ground truth of a heterogeneous labeled dataset, training within a transfer learning setting, and the use-case of merging multiple heterogeneously labeled datasets. For this purpose, a biomedical small-scale, multi-class semantic segmentation dataset is utilized. The heartSeg dataset is based on the medaka fish's position as a cardiac model system. Automating image recognition and semantic segmentation enables high-throughput experiments and is essential for biomedical research. Our approach and analysis show competitive results in supervised training regimes and encourage frugal labeling within biomedical image recognition."
https://openalex.org/W4210849176,"One of the major reasons that limit the practical applications of a brain-computer interface (BCI) is its long calibration time. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reducing the calibration time of motor imagery (MI)-based BCIs without sacrificing classification accuracy. The approach aims to augment the training set size of a new subject by generating artificial electroencephalogram (EEG) data from a few training trials initially available. The artificial EEG data are obtained by first performing empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and then mixing resulting intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The original training trials are aligned to common reference point with Euclidean alignment (EA) method prior to EMD and pooled together with artificial trials as the expended training set, which is input into a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier or a logistic regression (LR) classifier. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on two motor imagery (MI) data sets and compared with that of the algorithm trained with only real EEG data (Baseline) and the algorithm trained with expanded EEG data by EMD without data alignment. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the amount of training data needed to achieve a given performance level and thus is expected to facilitate the real-world applications of MI-based BCIs."
https://openalex.org/W4225979430,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) elicit massive inflammatory leukocyte recruitment to the aorta. CD4+ T cells, which include regulatory T cells (Tregs) and conventional T cells (Tconvs), are involved in the progression of AAA. Tregs have been reported to limit AAA formation. However, the function and phenotype of the Tconvs found in AAAs remain poorly understood. We characterized aortic Tconvs by bulk RNA sequencing and discovered that Tconvs in aortic aneurysm highly expressed Cxcr6 and Csf2. Herein, we determined that the CXCR6/CXCL16 signaling axis controlled the recruitment of Tconvs to aortic aneurysms. Deficiency of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), encoded by Csf2, markedly inhibited AAA formation and led to a decrease of inflammatory monocytes, due to a reduction of CCL2 expression. Conversely, the exogenous administration of GM-CSF exacerbated inflammatory monocyte infiltration by upregulating CCL2 expression, resulting in worsened AAA formation. Mechanistically, GM-CSF upregulated the expression of interferon regulatory factor 5 to promote M1-like macrophage differentiation in aortic aneurysms. Importantly, we also demonstrated that the GM-CSF produced by Tconvs enhanced the polarization of M1-like macrophages and exacerbated AAA formation. Our findings revealed that GM-CSF, which was predominantly derived from Tconvs in aortic aneurysms, played a pathogenic role in the progression of AAAs and may represent a potential target for AAA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4210570138,"Stable isotope ratios are used to reconstruct animal diet in trophic ecology via mixing models. Several assumptions of stable isotope mixing models are critical, i.e., constant trophic discrimination factor and isotopic equilibrium between the consumer and its diet. The isotopic turnover rate (Î» and its counterpart the half-life) affects the dynamics of isotopic incorporation for an organism and the isotopic equilibrium assumption: Î» involves a time lag between the real assimilated diet and the diet estimated by mixing models at the individual scale. Current stable isotope mixing model studies consider neither this time lag nor even the dynamics of isotopic ratios in general. We developed a mechanistic framework using a dynamic mixing model (DMM) to assess the contribution of Î» to the dynamics of isotopic incorporation and to estimate the bias induced by neglecting the time lag in diet reconstruction in conventional static mixing models (SMMs). The DMM includes isotope dynamics of sources (denoted Î´ s ), Î» and frequency of diet-switch ( Ï‰ ). The results showed a significant bias generated by the SMM compared to the DMM (up to 50% of differences). This bias can be strongly reduced in SMMs by averaging the isotopic variations of the food sources over a time window equal to twice the isotopic half-life. However, the bias will persist (âˆ¼15%) for intermediate values of the Ï‰ /Î» ratio. The inferences generated using a case study highlighted that DMM enhanced estimates of consumerâ€™s diet, and this could avoid misinterpretation in ecosystem functioning, food-web structure analysis and underlying biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W4210800756,"A wide range of bacteria possess virulence factors such as aminoacyl-tRNA transferases (ATTs) that are capable of rerouting aminoacyl-transfer RNAs away from protein synthesis to conjugate amino acids onto glycerolipids. We recently showed that, although these pathways were thought to be restricted to bacteria, higher fungi also possess ergosteryl-3Î²-O-L-aspartate synthases (ErdSs), which transfer the L-Asp moiety of aspartyl-tRNAAsp onto the 3Î²-OH group of ergosterol (Erg), yielding ergosteryl-3Î²-O-L-aspartate (Erg-Asp). Here, we report the discovery, in fungi, of a second type of fungal sterol-specific ATTs, namely, ergosteryl-3Î²-O-glycine (Erg-Gly) synthase (ErgS). ErgS consists of a freestanding DUF2156 domain encoded by a gene distinct from and paralogous to that of ErdS. We show that the enzyme only uses Gly-tRNAGly produced by an independent glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) to transfer glycine onto the 3Î²-OH of Erg, producing Erg-Gly. Phylogenomics analysis also show that the Erg-Gly synthesis pathway exists only in Ascomycota, including species of biotechnological interest, and more importantly, in human pathogens, such as Aspergillus fumigatus. The discovery of a second type of Erg-aa not only expands the repertoire of this particular class of fungal lipids but suggests that Erg-aa synthases might constitute a genuine subfamily of lipid-modifying ATTs."
https://openalex.org/W4210632002,"In humans, ciliary dysfunction causes ciliopathies, which present as multiple organ defects, including developmental and sensory abnormalities. Sdccag8 is a centrosomal/basal body protein essential for proper cilia formation. Gene mutations in SDCCAG8 have been found in patients with ciliopathies manifesting a broad spectrum of symptoms, including hypogonadism. Among these mutations, several that are predicted to truncate the SDCCAG8 carboxyl (C) terminus are also associated with such symptoms; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study, we identified the Sdccag8 C-terminal region (Sdccag8-C) as a module that interacts with the ciliopathy proteins, Ick/Cilk1 and Mak, which were shown to be essential for the regulation of ciliary protein trafficking and cilia length in mammals in our previous studies. We found that Sdccag8-C is essential for Sdccag8 localization to centrosomes and cilia formation in cultured cells. We then generated a mouse mutant in which Sdccag8-C was truncated (Sdccag8Î”C/Î”C mice) using a CRISPR-mediated stop codon knock-in strategy. In Sdccag8Î”C/Î”C mice, we observed abnormalities in cilia formation and ciliopathy-like organ phenotypes, including cleft palate, polydactyly, retinal degeneration, and cystic kidney, which partially overlapped with those previously observed in Ick- and Mak-deficient mice. Furthermore, Sdccag8Î”C/Î”C mice exhibited a defect in spermatogenesis, which was a previously uncharacterized phenotype of Sdccag8 dysfunction. Together, these results shed light on the molecular and pathological mechanisms underlying ciliopathies observed in patients with SDCCAG8 mutations and may advance our understanding of protein-protein interaction networks involved in cilia development."
https://openalex.org/W4210826154,"This paper proposes some high-ordered integer-valued auto-regressive time series process of order p (INAR(p)) with Zero-Inflated and Poisson-mixtures innovation distributions, wherein the predictor functions in these mentioned distributions allow for covariate specification, in particular, time-dependent covariates. The proposed time series structures are tested suitable to model the SARs-CoV-2 series in Mauritius which demonstrates excess zeros and hence significant over-dispersion with non-stationary trend. In addition, the INAR models allow the assessment of possible causes of COVID-19 in Mauritius. The results illustrate that the event of Vaccination and COVID-19 Stringency index are the most influential factors that can reduce the locally acquired COVID-19 cases and ultimately, the associated death cases. Moreover, the INAR(7) with Zero-inflated Negative Binomial innovations provides the best fitting and reliable Root Mean Square Errors, based on some short term forecasts. Undeniably, these information will hugely be useful to Mauritian authorities for implementation of comprehensive policies."

However, in countries like Sri Lanka, where continuous professional development is not mandatory for license renewal and antimicrobial stewardship is not implemented, prescribing practices go largely unchecked.To identify the knowledge on antibiotic use and practices related to antibiotic prescribing among Sri Lankan doctors.This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020. We used a validated, pretested Google-form based questionnaire with multiple choices, single best answer questions, polar questions (Yes/No) and five-point Likert scale questions. The Google-sheet generated was used for data analysis. Knowledge and practice scores were calculated.Of the 262 respondents, 40.1% were males. Majority (61.8%) were aged 25-35-years and in medical practice for 0-5 years (48.9%) while 46.2% had or were engaged in post graduate studies. Knowledge scores ranged from 98.31% to 46.55% [mean:71.27% (SDÂ±10.83); median:71.18% (IQR 64.4-79.7)]. Most (98.09%) obtained â‰¥50 marks while 45.8% scored more than the mean. The practice scores ranged from 100% to 0% [mean:65.33% (SDÂ±18.16), median:66.67% (IQR53.3-80)]. The majority (81.3%) scored â‰¥50 in the practice score while 52.3% achieved more than the mean practice score. The knowledge score and the practice score differed significantly (p<0.001, related sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) but the knowledge and practice scores were significantly correlated [Spearman correlation, p<0.001, r = 0.343 (Bias corrected 95% CI 0.237-0.448)]. Knowledge scores and the practice scores were significantly higher in those with or undergoing postgraduate training.While the knowledge and practice scores were high, and knowledge and practice scores were correlated, the practices score was lower than that of knowledge indicating the need to encourage correct practices through means other than solely promoting knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W4210866175,"Aspherical- and multi-curve rigid gas-permeable hard contact lenses (HCLs) have a flattened curve in the peripheral zone and are mostly used for patients with keratoconus who cannot wear glasses, soft contact lenses, or spherical HCLs. In this retrospective study, a total of 95 eyes of 77 patients who used aspherical- or multi-curve HCLs (mean age: 40.0 Â± 11.0 years) were evaluated. This study examined the types of aspherical- and multi-curve HCLs, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) values before and after wearing HCLs, the association with the Amsler-Krumeich classification, duration of wear, corneal/conjunctival disorder, and the frequency of changing HCLs. There were 78 eyes that used aspherical-curve HCLs and 17 that used multi-curve HCLs. BCVA significantly improved from 0.42 logMAR to 0.06 logMAR after wearing either form of HCL. The Amsler-Krumeich classification showed that aspherical-curve HCLs were commonly used for patients with stage 2 keratoconus, and multi-curve HCLs were commonly used for stage 4 patients. The BCVA values were worse when the disease stage was more severe (stages 3 and 4) regardless of HCL type. The mean base curve of the lenses was steeper in multi-curve HCLs than in aspherical-curve HCLs. The more severe the disease stage, the steeper the base curve in both aspherical- and multi-curve HCLs. The duration of wear significantly improved from 2.1 h to 10.2 h, and corneal/conjunctival disorder similarly improved. The mean frequency of changing HCL types was 1.1 times. This study suggests that a flat peripheral curve design with aspherical- and multi-curve HCLs is useful for patients with keratoconus."
https://openalex.org/W4210872925,"Non-healing wounds are a major medical challenge, affecting over 6.5 million people in the US alone, with associated healthcare costs of about $16 billion annually. They can result in prolonged hospitalizations, work loss, disability, poor quality of life, and in diabetic patients with foot ulcers, amputation of the affected limb in 25% of patients. Though chronic ulcers may arise from different underlying diseases, the unifying feature is chronic infection, driving persistent inflammation that prolongs the healing process. One of the most frequently cultured or genetically identified pathogens in skin wounds is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This species avidly forms biofilms in the wound that impede bacterial eradication by the host's immune mechanisms and limit efficacy of systemic antibiotics. Thus, non-antibiotic approaches to limit the growth and biofilm formation of this wound pathogen would be an advance in the treatment of chronic wounds. Prior work has demonstrated that the growth of other microbial species can be modulated by catecholamine agonists and antagonists of the adrenergic receptors (ARs). Here, we demonstrate that not only can the growth of this common wound pathogen be modulated by catecholamines, but also that the beta-AR antagonists can significantly decrease their growth, and importantly, limit their ability to form biofilms. These findings suggest that beta adrenergic antagonists may have a therapeutic role in the treatment of chronic skin wounds."
https://openalex.org/W4210879305,"Objective To determine the significance of dysphagia on clinical outcomes of geriatric trauma patients. Methods This is a retrospective population-based study of geriatric trauma patients 65 years and older utilizing the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration dataset from 2010 to 2019. Patients with pre-admission dysphagia were excluded. Multivariable regression was used to create statistical adjustments. Primary outcomes included mortality and the development of dysphagia. Secondary outcomes included length of stay and complications. Subgroup analyses included patients with dementia, patients who received transgastric feeding tubes (GFTs) or tracheostomies, and speech language therapy consultation. Results A total of 52,946 geriatric patients developed dysphagia after admission during a 9-year period out of 1,150,438 geriatric trauma admissions. In general, patients who developed dysphagia had increased mortality, length of stay, and complications. When adjusted for traumatic brain and cervical spine injuries, the addition of mechanical ventilation decreased the mortality odds. This was also observed in the subset of patients with dysphagia who had GFTs placed. Of the three primary risk factors for dysphagia investigated, mechanical ventilation was the most strongly associated with later development of dysphagia and mortality. Conclusion The geriatric trauma population is vulnerable to dysphagia with a large number associated with traumatic brain injury, cervical spine injury, and polytraumatic injuries that lead to mechanical ventilation. Earlier intubation/mechanical ventilation in association with GFTs was found to be associated with decreased inpatient hospital mortality. Tracheostomy placement was shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of dysphagia. The utilization of speech language therapy was found to be inconsistently utilized."
https://openalex.org/W4210895214,"Infiltrative gliomas are the most common neoplasms arising in the brain, and remain largely incurable despite decades of research. A subset of these gliomas contains mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1mut) or, less commonly, IDH2 (together called ""IDHmut""). These mutations alter cellular biochemistry, and IDHmut gliomas are generally less aggressive than IDH wild-type (IDHwt) gliomas. Some preclinical studies and clinical trials have suggested that various forms of a ketogenic diet (KD), characterized by low-carbohydrate and high-fat content, may be beneficial in slowing glioma progression. However, adherence to a strict KD is difficult, and not all studies have shown promising results. Furthermore, no study has yet addressed whether IDHmut gliomas might be more sensitive to KD. The aim of the current study was to compare the effects of a unrestricted, cycling KD (weekly alternating between KD and standard diet) in preclinical models of IDHwt versus IDHmut gliomas. In vitro, simulating KD by treatment with the ketone body Î²-hydroxybutyrate had no effect on the proliferation of patient-derived IDHwt or IDHmut glioma cells, either in low or normal glucose conditions. Likewise, an unrestricted, cycling KD had no effect on the in vivo growth of patient-derived IDHwt or IDHmut gliomas, even though the cycling KD did result in persistently elevated circulating ketones. Furthermore, this KD conferred no survival benefit in mice engrafted with Sleeping-Beauty transposase-engineered IDHmut or IDHwt glioma. These data suggest that neither IDHwt nor IDHmut gliomas are particularly responsive to an unrestricted, cycling form of KD."
https://openalex.org/W4210944977,"This paper aims to explore several ways to construct a scientific and comprehensive early warning system (EWS) for local government debt risk in China. In order to achieve this goal, this paper studies the local government debt risk from multiple perspectives, i.e., individual risk, contagion risk, static risk and dynamic risk. Firstly, taking China's 30 provinces over the period of 2010~ 2018 as a sample, this paper establishes early warning indicators for individual risk of local government debt, and uses the network model to establish early warning indicators for contagion risk of local government debt. Then, this paper applies the criteria importance though intercrieria correlation (CRITIC) method and coefficient of variation method to obtain the proxy variable â… , which combines the above two risks. Secondly, based on the proxy variable â… , both the Markov-switching autoregressive (MS-AR) model and coefficient of variation method are used to obtain the proxy variable â…¡, which comprehensively considers the individual risk, contagion risk, static risk and dynamic risk of local government debt. Finally, machine learning algorithms are adopted to generalize the EWS designed in this paper. The results show that: (1) From different perspectives of local government debt risk, the list of provinces that require early warning is different; (2) The support vector machines can well generalize our EWS."
https://openalex.org/W4226310562,"FGF19/FGF15 is an endocrine regulator of hepatic bile salt and lipid metabolism, which has shown promising effects in the treatment of NASH in clinical trials. FGF19/15 is transcribed and released from enterocytes of the small intestine into enterohepatic circulation in response to bile-induced FXR activation. Previously, the TSS of FGF19 was identified to bind Wnt-regulated TCF7L2/encoded transcription factor TCF4 in colorectal cancer cells. Impaired Wnt signaling and specifical loss of function of its coreceptor LRP6 have been associated with NASH. We, therefore, examined if TCF7L2/TCF4 upregulates Fgf19 in the small intestine and restrains NASH through gut-liver crosstalk. We examined the mice globally overexpressing, haploinsufficient, and conditional knockout models of TCF7L2 in the intestinal epithelium. The TCF7L2+/- mice exhibited increased plasma bile salts and lipids and developed diet-induced fatty liver disease while mice globally overexpressing TCF7L2 were protected against these traits. Comprehensive in vivo analysis revealed that TCF7L2 transcriptionally upregulates FGF15 in the gut, leading to reduced bile synthesis and diminished intestinal lipid uptake. Accordingly, VilinCreert2 ; Tcf7L2fl/fl mice showed reduced Fgf19 in the ileum, and increased plasma bile. The global overexpression of TCF7L2 in mice with metabolic syndrome-linked LRP6R611C substitution rescued the fatty liver and fibrosis in the latter. Strikingly, the hepatic levels of TCF4 were reduced and CYP7a1 was increased in human NASH, indicating the relevance of TCF4-dependent regulation of bile synthesis to human disease. These studies identify the critical role of TCF4 as an upstream regulator of the FGF15-mediated gut-liver crosstalk that maintains bile and liver triglyceride homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4210826908,"The demand for long-term continuous care has led healthcare experts to focus on development challenges. On-chip energy consumption as a key challenge can be addressed by data reduction techniques. In this paper, the pseudo periodic nature of ElectroCardioGram(ECG) signals has been used to completely remove redundancy from frames. Compressing aligned QRS complexes by Compressed Sensing (CS), result in highly redundant measurement vectors. By removing this redundancy, a high cluster of near zero samples is gained. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is assessed using the standard MIT-BIH database. The results indicate that by aligning ECG frames, the proposed technique can achieve superior reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art techniques for all compression ratios. This study proves that by aligning ECG frames with a 0.05% unaligned frame rate(R-peak detection error), more compression could be gained for PRD > 5% when 5-bit non-uniform quantizer is used. Furthermore, analysis done on power consumption of the proposed technique, indicates that a very good recovery performance can be gained by only consuming 4.9Î¼W more energy per frame compared to traditional CS."
https://openalex.org/W4210865921,"To examine the diffusion characteristics of airflow and dust particles, a multi-factor and multi-level physical self-developed testing system is established. In this study, bunker height, chute angle, feeding speed, coal granularity, and belt speed are selected as independent variables, and airflow velocity and dust concentration are the response variables. The two-factor interactive model is established to analyze the primary and secondary relationship between the independent variables and the response variables. The results demonstrate a denser contour distribution of three-dimensional curved surfaces, suggesting an obvious interaction between the factors. The bunker height increases from 0.75 m to 1.15 m, the maximum increment of the induced airflow velocity at the outlet of the guide chute is observed to be 0.35 m/s, meanwhile, and with the increase in the feed speed from 2t/h to 8t/h, the increment of the induced airflow velocity at the outlet of the guide chute is recorded to be 51%. The coal granularity and bunker height depicted the highest influence on induced air velocity and dust concentration, and the feeding speed proved to be the secondary parameter. This two-factor interactive model can accurately forecast the actual values with a deviation of the calculated values limited to 9%. These research results support the existing research and provide a theoretical foundation to guide the dust control at belt conveyor transfer stations."

The aim of this study was to quantify the impact on sleep, wellness and training of Super Rugby players. Sleep of 122 players from four teams was monitored using activity monitors for up to three nights before and after matches played at home and overseas. Wellness and internal training load (questionnaires) and external training load (GPS/accelerometer) were also recorded. Separate analyses were performed for each team using a general linear mixed model to estimate the mean effects of travel (translocation overseas and return to the home country) on sleep, wellness and training. The mean effects of matches on sleep and wellness on the nights before, of and after matches. were also estimated. Teams generally experienced small to large reductions in sleep and wellness when overseas; on return, sleep and wellness recovered somewhat. The impact of matches on sleep and wellness differed in magnitude and direction (large reductions to small increases) between teams. External load overseas and upon return was reduced for three of the four teams, whilst internal load was reduced for the three teams that measured it. The changes in sleep, wellness and training can be explained by a combination of travel- and match-related stressors that differed between teams. Teams should consider remediation strategies to mitigate the effects of travel."

Our objective was to conduct an explorative pilot study to examine parents' perception of food intake for themselves and their young adult children with ASD. We employed comparative analysis to discover potential pathways to improve diet quality and lower the risk for chronic disease in individuals with ASD. Data from an online survey in n = 493 parent-child dyads on parentally reported intake patterns, food group, and food consumption was analyzed using kappa statistics to determine the level of agreement between reported parental and child intake patterns, body weight status and activity level. Average age was 48 years for parents and 22 years for their children, respectively. Parent-child agreement for obesity was high. We found very strong agreement between the reported diet variety (kappa = 0.82) and changing daily intake (kappa = 0.63) and strong agreement for some vegetable intake patterns (kappa = 0.61 for orange, white, and starchy vegetables) but not in meat intake (no agreement). Results of this study indicate evidence for perceived intergenerational transfer of dietary intake patterns, which may offer effective approaches to change parental diet, to subsequently improve diet quality in young adults with ASD and prevent diet-related chronic diseases in individuals with ASD."
https://openalex.org/W4210932864,"The ability to determine a sound's location is critical in everyday life. However, sound source localization is severely compromised for patients with hearing loss who receive bilateral cochlear implants (BiCIs). Several patient factors relate to poorer performance in listeners with BiCIs, associated with auditory deprivation, experience, and age. Critically, characteristic errors are made by patients with BiCIs (e.g., medial responses at lateral target locations), and the relationship between patient factors and the type of errors made by patients has seldom been investigated across individuals. In the present study, several different types of analysis were used to understand localization errors and their relationship with patient-dependent factors (selected based on their robustness of prediction). Binaural hearing experience is required for developing accurate localization skills, auditory deprivation is associated with degradation of the auditory periphery, and aging leads to poorer temporal resolution. Therefore, it was hypothesized that earlier onsets of deafness would be associated with poorer localization acuity and longer periods without BiCI stimulation or older age would lead to greater amounts of variability in localization responses. A novel machine learning approach was introduced to characterize the types of errors made by listeners with BiCIs, making them simple to interpret and generalizable to everyday experience. Sound localization performance was measured in 48 listeners with BiCIs using pink noise trains presented in free-field. Our results suggest that older age at testing and earlier onset of deafness are associated with greater average error, particularly for sound sources near the center of the head, consistent with previous research. The machine learning analysis revealed that variability of localization responses tended to be greater for individuals with earlier compared to later onsets of deafness. These results suggest that early bilateral hearing is essential for best sound source localization outcomes in listeners with BiCIs."

CALY-SWE are targeted towards use in cost-effectiveness evaluations of social welfare consequences. Here, we first motivate the measure both from a theoretical and from a Swedish policy-making perspective. Then, we outline the core principles of the measure, namely the relation to the capability approach, embedded equity considerations inspired by the fair-innings approach, and the bases for which capabilities should be considered. The aims were to 1) the most vital capabilities for individuals in Sweden, 2) to define a sufficient level of each identified capability to lead a flourishing life, and to 3) develop a complete questionnaire for the measurement of the identified capabilities.For the selection of capabilities, we used a Delphi process with Swedish civil society representants. To inform the questionnaire development, we conducted a web survey in three versions, with each Swedish 500 participants, to assess the distribution of capabilities that resulted from the Delphi process in the Swedish population. Each version was formulated with different strictness so that less strict wordings of a capability level would apply to a larger share of participants. All versions also included questions on inequality aversion regarding financial, educational, and health capabilities.The Delphi process resulted in the following six capabilities: Financial situation & housing, health, social relations, occupations, security, and political & civil rights. We formulated the final phrasing for the questionnaire based on normative reasons and the distribution of capabilities in the population while taking into account inequality aversion.We developed a capability-based model for cost effectiveness economic evaluations of broader social consequences, specific to the Swedish context."
https://openalex.org/W4210836252,"Ecological restoration frequently involves the addition of native plants, but the effectiveness (in terms of plant growth, plant survival, and cost) of using seeds versus container plants has not been studied in many plant communities. It is also not known if plant success would vary by species or based on functional traits. To answer these questions, we added several shrub species to a coastal sage scrub restoration site as seeds or as seedlings in a randomized block design. We measured percent cover, density, species richness, size, survival, and costs. Over the two years of the study, shrubs added to the site as seeds grew more and continued to have greater density than plants added from containers. Seeded plots also had greater native species richness than planted plots. However, shrubs from containers had higher survival rates, and percent cover was comparable between the planted and seeded treatments. Responses varied by species depending on functional traits, with deep-rooted evergreen species establishing better from container plants. Our cost analysis showed that it is more expensive to use container plants than seed, with most of the costs attributed to labor and supplies needed to grow plants. Our measurements of shrub density, survival, species richness, and growth in two years in our experimental plots lead us to conclude that coastal sage scrub restoration with seeds is optimal for increasing density and species richness with limited funds, yet the addition of some species from container plants may be necessary if key species are desired as part of the project objectives."

https://openalex.org/W4210862801,"Focal polarization is necessary for finely arranged cell-cell interactions. The yeast mating projection, with its punctate polarisome, is a good model system for this process. We explored the critical role of the polarisome scaffold protein Spa2 during yeast mating with a hypothesis motivated by mathematical modeling and tested by in vivo experiments. Our simulations predicted that two positive feedback loops generate focal polarization, including a novel feedback pathway involving the N-terminal domain of Spa2. We characterized the latter using loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants. The N-terminal region contains a Spa2 Homology Domain (SHD) which is conserved from yeast to humans, and when mutated largely reproduced the spa2Î” phenotype. Our work together with published data show that the SHD domain recruits Msb3/4 that stimulates Sec4-mediated transport of Bud6 to the polarisome. There, Bud6 activates Bni1-catalyzed actin cable formation, recruiting more Spa2 and completing the positive feedback loop. We demonstrate that disrupting this loop at any point results in morphological defects. Gain-of-function perturbations partially restored focal polarization in a spa2 loss-of-function mutant without restoring localization of upstream components, thus supporting the pathway order. Thus, we have collected data consistent with a novel positive feedback loop that contributes to focal polarization during pheromone-induced polarization in yeast."

Prior to the implementation of this policy, coverage of four ANC visits has been suboptimal in many low-income settings. In this study we explore socio-demographic factors associated with early initiation of first ANC contact and attending at least four ANC visits (""ANC4+"") in Malawi using the Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) data collected between 2004 and 2016, prior to the implementation of new recommendations.We combined data from the 2004-5, 2010 and 2015-16 MDHS using Stata version 16. Participants included all women surveyed between the ages of 15-49 who had given birth in the five years preceding the survey. We conducted weighted univariate, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis of the effects of each of the predictor variables on the binary endpoint of the woman attending at least four ANC visits and having the first ANC attendance within or before the four months of pregnancy (ANC4+). To determine whether a factor was included in the model, the likelihood ratio test was used with a statistical significance of P< 0.05 as the threshold.We evaluated data collected in surveys in 2004/5, 2010 and 2015/6 from 26386 women who had given birth in the five years before being surveyed. The median gestational age, in months, at the time of presenting for the first ANC visit was 5 (inter quartile range: 4-6). The proportion of women initiating ANC4+ increased from 21.3% in 2004-5 to 38.8% in 2015-16. From multivariate analysis, there was increasing trend in ANC4+ from women aged 20-24 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.27, 95%CI:1.05-1.53, P = 0.01) to women aged 45-49 years (aOR = 1.91, 95%CI:1.18-3.09, P = 0.008) compared to those aged 15-19 years. Women from richest socio-economic position ((aOR = 1.32, 95%CI:1.12-1.58, P<0.001) were more likely to demonstrate ANC4+ than those from low socio-economic position. Additionally, women who had completed secondary (aOR = 1.24, 95%CI:1.02-1.51, P = 0.03) and tertiary (aOR = 2.64, 95%CI:1.65-4.22, P<0.001) education were more likely to report having ANC4+ than those with no formal education. Conversely increasing parity was associated with a reduction in likelihood of ANC4+ with women who had previously delivered 2-3 (aOR = 0.74, 95%CI:0.63-0.86, P<0.001), 4-5 (aOR = 0.65, 95%CI:0.53-0.80, P<0.001) or greater than 6 (aOR = 0.61, 95%CI: 0.47-0.79, <0.001) children being less likely to demonstrate ANC4+.The proportion of women reporting ANC4+ and of key ANC interventions in Malawi have increased significantly since 2004. However, we found that most women did not access the recommended number of ANC visits in Malawi, prior to the 2016 WHO policy change which may mean that women are less likely to undertake the 2016 WHO recommendation of 8 contacts per pregnancy. Additionally, our results highlighted significant variation in coverage according to key socio-demographic variables which should be considered when devising national strategies to ensure that all women access the appropriate frequency of ANC visits during their pregnancy."
