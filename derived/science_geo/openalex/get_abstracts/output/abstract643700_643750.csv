https://openalex.org/W2991023348,"Identifying the causes of human diseases requires deconvolution of abnormal molecular phenotypes spanning DNA accessibility, gene expression and protein abundance1-3. We present a single-cell framework that integrates highly multiplexed protein quantification, transcriptome profiling and analysis of chromatin accessibility. Using this approach, we establish a normal epigenetic baseline for healthy blood development, which we then use to deconvolve aberrant molecular features within blood from patients with mixed-phenotype acute leukemia4,5. Despite widespread epigenetic heterogeneity within the patient cohort, we observe common malignant signatures across patients as well as patient-specific regulatory features that are shared across phenotypic compartments of individual patients. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin-accessibility maps identified 91,601 putative peak-to-gene linkages and transcription factors that regulate leukemia-specific genes, such as RUNX1-linked regulatory elements proximal to the marker gene CD69. These results demonstrate how integrative, multiomic analysis of single cells within the framework of normal development can reveal both distinct and shared molecular mechanisms of disease from patient samples."
https://openalex.org/W2989680640,"Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a transcriptional co-activator that regulates cell proliferation and survival by binding to a select set of enhancers for target gene activation. How YAP coordinates these transcriptional responses is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that YAP forms liquid-like condensates in the nucleus. Formed within seconds of hyperosmotic stress, YAP condensates compartmentalized the YAP transcription factor TEAD1 and other YAP-related co-activators, including TAZ, and subsequently induced the transcription of YAP-specific proliferation genes. Super-resolution imaging using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with photoactivated localization microscopy revealed that the YAP nuclear condensates were areas enriched in accessible chromatin domains organized as super-enhancers. Initially devoid of RNA polymerase II, the accessible chromatin domains later acquired RNA polymerase II, transcribing RNA. The removal of the intrinsically-disordered YAP transcription activation domain prevented the formation of YAP condensates and diminished downstream YAP signalling. Thus, dynamic changes in genome organization and gene activation during YAP reprogramming is mediated by liquid-liquid phase separation."
https://openalex.org/W2990395719,"How transcription factors (TFs) interpret cis-regulatory DNA sequence to control gene expression remains unclear, largely because past studies using native and engineered sequences had insufficient scale. Here, we measure the expression output of >100 million synthetic yeast promoter sequences that are fully random. These sequences yield diverse, reproducible expression levels that can be explained by their chance inclusion of functional TF binding sites. We use machine learning to build interpretable models of transcriptional regulation that predict ~94% of the expression driven from independent test promoters and ~89% of the expression driven from native yeast promoter fragments. These models allow us to characterize each TF's specificity, activity and interactions with chromatin. TF activity depends on binding-site strand, position, DNA helical face and chromatin context. Notably, expression level is influenced by weak regulatory interactions, which confound designed-sequence studies. Our analyses show that massive-throughput assays of fully random DNA can provide the big data necessary to develop complex, predictive models of gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2990466613,"Viruses are implicated in autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet β cells, which results in insulin deficiency and type 1 diabetes (T1D)1-4. Certain enteroviruses can infect β cells in vitro5, have been detected in the pancreatic islets of patients with T1D6 and have shown an association with T1D in meta-analyses4. However, establishing consistency in findings across studies has proven difficult. Obstacles to convincingly linking RNA viruses to islet autoimmunity may be attributed to rapid viral mutation rates, the cyclical periodicity of viruses7 and the selection of variants with altered pathogenicity and ability to spread in populations. β cells strongly express cell-surface coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CXADR) genes, which can facilitate enterovirus infection8. Studies of human pancreata and cultured islets have shown significant variation in enteroviral virulence to β cells between serotypes and within the same serotype9,10. In this large-scale study of known eukaryotic DNA and RNA viruses in stools from children, we evaluated fecally shed viruses in relation to islet autoimmunity and T1D. This study showed that prolonged enterovirus B rather than independent, short-duration enterovirus B infections may be involved in the development of islet autoimmunity, but not T1D, in some young children. Furthermore, we found that fewer early-life human mastadenovirus C infections, as well as CXADR rs6517774, independently correlated with islet autoimmunity."

https://openalex.org/W2991172159,"Biomarkers for monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy are lacking for muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Noninvasive in vivo molecular imaging with multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) uses pulsed laser light to induce acoustic pressure waves, enabling the visualization of endogenous chromophores. Here we describe an application of MSOT, in which illumination in the near- and extended near-infrared ranges from 680-1,100 nm enables the visualization and quantification of collagen content. We first demonstrated the feasibility of this approach to noninvasive quantification of tissue fibrosis in longitudinal studies in a large-animal Duchenne muscular dystrophy model in pigs, and then applied this approach to pediatric patients. MSOT-derived collagen content measurements in skeletal muscle were highly correlated to the functional status of the patients and provided additional information on molecular features as compared to magnetic resonance imaging. This study highlights the potential of MSOT imaging as a noninvasive, age-independent biomarker for the implementation and monitoring of newly developed therapies in muscular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2989837443,"Materials can be made multifunctional by embedding them with living cells that perform sensing, synthesis, energy production, and physical movement. A challenge is that the conditions needed for living cells are not conducive to materials processing and require continuous water and nutrients. Here, we present a three dimensional (3D) printer that can mix material and cell streams to build 3D objects. Bacillus subtilis spores were printed within the material and germinated on its exterior surface, including spontaneously in new cracks. The material was resilient to extreme stresses, including desiccation, solvents, osmolarity, pH, ultraviolet light, and γ-radiation. Genetic engineering enabled the bacteria to respond to stimuli or produce chemicals on demand. As a demonstration, we printed custom-shaped hydrogels containing bacteria that can sense or kill Staphylococcus aureus, a causative agent of infections. This work demonstrates materials endued with living functions that can be used in applications that require storage or exposure to environmental stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2989809536,"The enormous size of mammalian genomes means that for a DNA-binding protein the number of nonspecific, off-target sites vastly exceeds the number of specific, cognate sites. How mammalian DNA-binding proteins overcome this challenge to efficiently locate their target sites is not known. Here, through live-cell single-molecule tracking, we show that CCCTC-binding factor, CTCF, is repeatedly trapped in small zones that likely correspond to CTCF clusters, in a manner that is largely dependent on an internal RNA-binding region (RBRi). We develop a new theoretical model called anisotropic diffusion through transient trapping in zones to explain CTCF dynamics. Functionally, transient RBRi-mediated trapping increases the efficiency of CTCF target search by ~2.5-fold. Overall, our results suggest a 'guided' mechanism where CTCF clusters concentrate diffusing CTCF proteins near cognate binding sites, thus increasing the local ON-rate. We suggest that local guiding may allow DNA-binding proteins to more efficiently locate their target sites."

https://openalex.org/W2990122700,"The first lineage specification of pluripotent mouse epiblast segregates neuroectoderm (NE) from mesoderm and definitive endoderm (ME) by mechanisms that are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the induction of ME gene programs critically relies on the T-box transcription factors Eomesodermin (also known as Eomes) and Brachyury, which concomitantly repress pluripotency and NE gene programs. Cells deficient in these T-box transcription factors retain pluripotency and differentiate to NE lineages despite the presence of ME-inducing signals transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Nodal and Wnt. Pluripotency and NE gene networks are additionally repressed by ME factors downstream of T-box factor induction, demonstrating a redundancy in program regulation to safeguard mutually exclusive lineage specification. Analyses of chromatin revealed that accessibility of ME enhancers depends on T-box factor binding, whereas NE enhancers are accessible and already activation primed at pluripotency. This asymmetry of the chromatin landscape thus explains the default differentiation of pluripotent cells to NE in the absence of ME induction that depends on activating and repressive functions of Eomes and Brachyury."
https://openalex.org/W2990399259,"Wild bees are important pollinators in many ecosystems threatened by anthropogenic disturbance. Urban development can reduce and degrade natural habitat for bees and other pollinators. However, some researchers suggest that cities could also provide refuge for bees, given that agricultural intensification may pose a greater risk. In this study, we surveyed bee communities at 15 farms and gardens across an urban-rural gradient in southeastern Michigan, USA to evaluate the effect of urbanization on bees. We examined how floral resources, bee functional traits, temperature, farm size, and the spatial scale of analysis influence bee response to urbanization. We found that urbanization positively affected bee diversity and evenness but had no effect on total abundance or species richness. Additionally, urbanization altered bee community composition via differential effects on bee species and functional groups. More urbanized sites supported a greater number of exotic, above-ground nesting, and solitary bees, but fewer eusocial bees. Blooming plant species richness positively influenced bee species diversity and richness. Furthermore, the amount of available floral resources was positively associated with exotic and eusocial bee abundances. Across sites, nearly 70% of floral resources were provided by exotic plants, most of which are characterized as weedy but not invasive. Our study demonstrates that urbanization can benefit some bee species and negatively impact others. Notably, Bombus and Lasioglossum (Dialictus), were two important pollinator groups negatively affected by urbanization. Our study supports the idea that urban environments can provide valuable habitat for diverse bee communities, but demonstrates that some bees are vulnerable to urbanization. Finally, while our results indicate that increasing the abundance and richness of floral resources could partially compensate for negative effects of urbanization on bees, the effectiveness of such measures may be limited by other factors, such as urban warming."
https://openalex.org/W2991436924,"Apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis) elicits an anti-inflammatory response by phagocytes, but the mechanisms that underlie this response are still being defined. Here, we uncover a chloride-sensing signalling pathway that controls both the phagocyte 'appetite' and its anti-inflammatory response. Efferocytosis transcriptionally altered the genes that encode the solute carrier (SLC) proteins SLC12A2 and SLC12A4. Interfering with SLC12A2 expression or function resulted in a significant increase in apoptotic corpse uptake per phagocyte, whereas the loss of SLC12A4 inhibited corpse uptake. In SLC12A2-deficient phagocytes, the canonical anti-inflammatory program was replaced by pro-inflammatory and oxidative-stress-associated gene programs. This 'switch' to pro-inflammatory sensing of apoptotic cells resulted from the disruption of the chloride-sensing pathway (and not due to corpse overload or poor degradation), including the chloride-sensing kinases WNK1, OSR1 and SPAK-which function upstream of SLC12A2-had a similar effect on efferocytosis. Collectively, the WNK1-OSR1-SPAK-SLC12A2/SLC12A4 chloride-sensing pathway and chloride flux in phagocytes are key modifiers of the manner in which phagocytes interpret the engulfed apoptotic corpse."
https://openalex.org/W2990404188,"Early disease diagnosis is key to the effective treatment of diseases. Histopathological analysis of human biopsies is the gold standard to diagnose tissue alterations. However, this approach has low resolution and overlooks 3D (three-dimensional) structural changes resulting from functional alterations. Here, we applied multiphoton imaging, 3D digital reconstructions and computational simulations to generate spatially resolved geometrical and functional models of human liver tissue at different stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We identified a set of morphometric cellular and tissue parameters correlated with disease progression, and discover profound topological defects in the 3D bile canalicular (BC) network. Personalized biliary fluid dynamic simulations predicted an increased pericentral biliary pressure and micro-cholestasis, consistent with elevated cholestatic biomarkers in patients' sera. Our spatially resolved models of human liver tissue can contribute to high-definition medicine by identifying quantitative multiparametric cellular and tissue signatures to define disease progression and provide new insights into NAFLD pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2991240508,"TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) responds to microbial stimuli and mediates the induction of type I interferon (IFN). Here, we show that TBK1 is also a central mediator of growth factor signalling; this function of TBK1 relies on a specific adaptor-TBK-binding protein 1 (TBKBP1). TBKBP1 recruits TBK1 to protein kinase C-theta (PKCθ) through a scaffold protein, CARD10. This enables PKCθ to phosphorylate TBK1 at Ser 716, a crucial step for TBK1 activation by growth factors but not by innate immune stimuli. Although the TBK1-TBKBP1 signalling axis is not required for the induction of type I IFN, it mediates mTORC1 activation and oncogenesis. Conditional deletion of either TBK1 or TBKBP1 in lung epithelial cells inhibits tumourigenesis in a mouse model of lung cancer. In addition to promoting tumour growth, the TBK1-TBKBP1 axis facilitates tumour-mediated immunosuppression through a mechanism that involves induction of the checkpoint molecule PD-L1 and stimulation of glycolysis. These findings suggest a PKCθ-TBKBP1-TBK1 growth factor signalling axis that mediates both tumour growth and immunosuppression."

https://openalex.org/W2989766840,"The agriculture sector may help to improve the environment of any country. The purpose of this research is to test the existence of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis while keeping the energy consumption and agriculture share in income into account and analyze their effects on the CO2 emissions per capita of Saudi Arabia. We test both symmetrical, asymmetrical and quadratic effects of agriculture sector on the CO2 emissions. An inverted U-shaped relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and CO2 emissions per capita is found. Hence, EKC hypothesis is validated with a turning point at GDP per capita of 77,068 constant Saudi Riyal. Further, a negative and significant effect of agriculture sector on the CO2 emissions per capita has been found both in symmetrical and asymmetrical analyses. The magnitudes of effects of increasing and decreasing agriculture share are found statistically different on the CO2 emissions, and rising agriculture share in GDP has larger effect than that of decreasing agriculture share. An inverted U-shaped relationship is also found between agriculture share in GDP and CO2 emissions per capita with a turning point at 3.22% agriculture share in GDP."
https://openalex.org/W2990836466,"The enteric nervous system (ENS) predominantly originates from vagal neural crest (VNC) cells that emerge from the caudal hindbrain, invade the foregut and populate the gastrointestinal tract. However, the gene regulatory network (GRN) orchestrating the early specification of VNC remains unknown. Using an EdnrB enhancer, we generated a comprehensive temporal map of the chromatin and transcriptional landscape of VNC in the avian model, revealing three VNC cell clusters (neural, neurogenic and mesenchymal), each predetermined epigenetically prior to neural tube delamination. We identify and functionally validate regulatory cores (Sox10/Tfap2B/SoxB/Hbox) mediating each programme and elucidate their combinatorial activities with other spatiotemporally specific transcription factors (bHLH/NR). Our global deconstruction of the VNC-GRN in vivo sheds light on critical early regulatory mechanisms that may influence the divergent neural phenotypes in enteric neuropathies."
https://openalex.org/W2989791081,"Multiciliated cells (MCCs) amplify large numbers of centrioles that convert into basal bodies, which are required for producing multiple motile cilia. Most centrioles amplified by MCCs grow on the surface of organelles called deuterosomes, whereas a smaller number grow through the centriolar pathway in association with the two parent centrioles. Here, we show that MCCs lacking deuterosomes amplify the correct number of centrioles with normal step-wise kinetics. This is achieved through a massive production of centrioles on the surface and in the vicinity of parent centrioles. Therefore, deuterosomes may have evolved to relieve, rather than supplement, the centriolar pathway during multiciliogenesis. Remarkably, MCCs lacking parent centrioles and deuterosomes also amplify the appropriate number of centrioles inside a cloud of pericentriolar and fibrogranular material. These data show that the centriole number is set independently of their nucleation platforms and suggest that massive centriole production in MCCs is a robust process that can self-organize. Mercey et al. demonstrate that without deuterosomes, multiciliated cells still develop the proper number of centrioles with normal step-wise kinetics, independent of the growing platform."

https://openalex.org/W2991142785,"Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are used for structural1,2 and evolutionary predictions1,2, but the complexity of aligning large datasets requires the use of approximate solutions3, including the progressive algorithm4. Progressive MSA methods start by aligning the most similar sequences and subsequently incorporate the remaining sequences, from leaf to root, based on a guide tree. Their accuracy declines substantially as the number of sequences is scaled up5. We introduce a regressive algorithm that enables MSA of up to 1.4 million sequences on a standard workstation and substantially improves accuracy on datasets larger than 10,000 sequences. Our regressive algorithm works the other way around from the progressive algorithm and begins by aligning the most dissimilar sequences. It uses an efficient divide-and-conquer strategy to run third-party alignment methods in linear time, regardless of their original complexity. Our approach will enable analyses of extremely large genomic datasets such as the recently announced Earth BioGenome Project, which comprises 1.5 million eukaryotic genomes6. Alignment of 1.4 million sequences is made possible by upgrading T-Coffee with a regressive alignment algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2992537377,"MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is highly expressed in hepatocytes, where it plays an important role in regulating cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, and it is also a host factor required for hepatitis C virus replication. miR-122 is selectively stabilized by 3′ adenylation mediated by the cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase GLD-2 (also known as PAPD4 or TENT2). However, it is unclear how GLD-2 specifically stabilizes miR-122. Here, we show that QKI7 KH domain-containing RNA binding (QKI-7), one of three isoforms of the QKI proteins, which are members of the signal transduction and activation of RNA (STAR) family of RNA-binding proteins, is involved in miR-122 stabilization. QKI down-regulation specifically decreased the steady-state level of mature miR-122, but did not affect the pre-miR-122 level. We also found that QKI-7 uses its C-terminal region to interact with GLD-2 and its QUA2 domain to associate with the RNA-induced silencing complex protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2), indicating that the GLD-2–QKI-7 interaction recruits GLD-2 to Ago2. QKI-7 exhibited specific affinity to miR-122 and significantly promoted GLD-2–mediated 3′ adenylation of miR-122 in vitro. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-122 binds Ago2–interacting QKI-7, which recruits GLD-2 for 3′ adenylation and stabilization of miR-122."
https://openalex.org/W2991244815,"Our primary goal is to therapeutically target the oncogenic transcription factor MYC to stop tumor growth and cancer progression. Here, we report aspects of the biophysical states of the MYC protein and its interaction with one of the best-characterized MYC cofactors, TRansactivation/tRansformation-domain Associated Protein (TRRAP). The MYC:TRRAP interaction is critical for MYC function in promoting cancer. The interaction between MYC and TRRAP occurs at a precise region in the MYC protein, called MYC Homology Box 2 (MB2), which is central to the MYC transactivation domain (TAD). Although the MYC TAD is inherently disordered, this report suggests that MB2 may acquire a defined structure when complexed with TRRAP which could be exploited for the investigation of inhibitors of MYC function by preventing this protein-protein interaction (PPI). The MYC TAD, and in particular the MB2 motif, is unique and invariant in evolution, suggesting that MB2 is an ideal site for inhibiting MYC function."
https://openalex.org/W2992119762,"Background Despite advancements in pharmacological and device-based treatment, heart failure (HF) continues to impose an enormous burden for health care system worldwide. Decompensation of HF is one of the main causes of hospitalization, therefore the identification of patients with the highest risk of such complication is still of great clinical importance. The prognostic significance and utility of global longitudinal strain (GLS) has been previously studied in patients with the broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases in various endpoints, however its role in assessing the risk of hospitalization due to HF exacerbation of optimally treated outpatients has not been fully explored. Therefore, the aim of the study was to verify whether the GLS of the left ventricle (LV) derived by 2D speckle tracking echocardiography has, independently of other well-known clinical parameters, an additional impact on the risk of HF decompensation in stable patients with LV systolic dysfunction of ischemic origin. Methods In 193 clinically stable HF outpatients with LV ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 50%, GLS, additionally to other clinical parameters, was analyzed. During 34 (14–71) months of follow-up, 58 patients were hospitalized due to HF decompensation (EVENT). Results EVENT was significantly associated with age, QRS width, NYHA functional class, left atrium diameter, LV systolic and diastolic volume, LVEF, hemoglobin, brain natriuretic peptide, diuretic treatment, absence of beta-blockers, impaired renal function and history of diabetes in univariate Cox analyzes. GLS with pre-specified cut-off value of -9.4% was also significantly associated with the EVENT (HR 15.16; 95% CI 1.81–126.91). After adjusting for above-mentioned parameters GLS was still a significant predictor of hospitalization due to HF decompensation. Conclusions GLS measurement can provide incremental information on the risk of HF decompensation in stable outpatients with LV systolic dysfunction of ischemic origin."
https://openalex.org/W2993572480,"Objectives The primary objective of this trial was to assess safety and anti-inflammatory effects of an add-on training program involving breathing exercises, cold exposure, and meditation in patients with axial spondyloarthritis Methods This study was an open-label, randomised, one-way crossover clinical proof-of-concept trial. Twenty-four patients with moderately active axial spondyloarthritis(ASDAS >2.1) and hs-CRP ≥5mg/L were included and randomised to an intervention (n = 13) and control group (n = 11) group that additionally received the intervention after the control period. The intervention period lasted for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was safety, secondary endpoints were change in hs-CRP, serum calprotectin levels and ESR over the 8-week period. Exploratory endpoints included disease activity measured by ASDAS-CRP and BASDAI, quality of life (SF-36, EQ-5D, EQ-5D VAS), and hospital anxiety and depression (HADS). Results We found no significant differences in adverse events between groups, with one serious adverse event occurring 8 weeks after end of the intervention and judged ‘unrelated’. During the 8-week intervention period, there was a significant decline of ESR from (median [interquartile range] to 16 [9–26.5] to 9 [5–23] mm/hr, p = 0.040, whereas no effect was found in the control group (from 14 [8.3–27.3] to 16 [5–37] m/hr, p = 0.406). ASDAS-CRP declined from 3.1 [2.5–3.6] to 2.3 [1.9–3.2] in the intervention group (p = 0.044). A similar trend was observed for serum calprotectin (p = 0.064 in the intervention group versus p = 0.182 in the control group), but not for hs-CRP. Conclusions This proof-of-concept study in axial spondyloarthritis met its primary endpoint with no safety signals during the intervention. There was a significant decrease in ESR levels and ASDAS-CRP upon the add-on training program in the intervention group. These findings warrant full-scale randomised controlled trials of this novel therapeutic approach in patients with inflammatory conditions. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02744014"
https://openalex.org/W2991421987,"Unregulated protein-tyrosine kinase signaling is a common feature of AML, often involving mutations in Flt3 and overexpression of myeloid Src-family kinases (Hck, Fgr, Lyn). Here we show that high-level expression of these Src kinases predicts poor survival in a large cohort of AML patients. To test the therapeutic benefit of Flt3 and Src-family kinase inhibition, we used the pyrrolopyrimidine kinase inhibitor A-419259. This compound potently inhibits Hck, Fgr, and Lyn as well as Flt3 bearing an activating internal tandem duplication (ITD). Flt3-ITD expression sensitized human TF-1 myeloid cells to growth arrest by A-419259, supporting direct action on the Flt3-ITD kinase domain. Cells transformed with the Flt3-ITD mutants D835Y and F691L were resistant to A-419259, while co-expression of Hck or Fgr restored inhibitor sensitivity to Flt3-ITD D835Y. Conversely, Hck and Fgr mutants with engineered A-419259 resistance mutations decreased sensitivity of TF-1/Flt3-ITD cells. To investigate de novo resistance mechanisms, A-419259-resistant Flt3-ITD+ AML cell populations were derived via long-term dose escalation. Whole exome sequencing identified a distinct Flt3-ITD kinase domain mutation (N676S/T) among all A-419259 target kinases in each of six independent resistant cell populations. These studies show that Hck and Fgr expression influences inhibitor sensitivity and the pathway to acquired resistance in Flt3-ITD+ AML."
https://openalex.org/W2993760864,"The Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) is a sporozoite surface protein whose role in sporozoite motility and cell invasion has made it the leading candidate for a pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine. However, production of high yields of soluble recombinant PfCSP, including its extensive NANP and NVDP repeats, has proven problematic. Here, we report on the development and characterization of a secreted, soluble, and stable full-length PfCSP (containing 4 NVDP and 38 NANP repeats) produced in the Lactococcus lactis expression system. The recombinant full-length PfCSP, denoted PfCSP4/38, was produced initially with a histidine tag and purified by a simple two-step procedure. Importantly, the recombinant PfCSP4/38 retained a conformational epitope for antibodies as confirmed by both in vivo and in vitro characterizations. We characterized this complex protein by HPLC, light scattering, MS analysis, differential scanning fluorimetry, CD, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with conformation-dependent and -independent mAbs, which confirmed it to be both pure and soluble. Moreover, we found that the recombinant protein is stable at both frozen and elevated-temperature storage conditions. When we used L. lactis–derived PfCSP4/38 to immunize mice, it elicited high levels of functional antibodies that had the capacity to modify sporozoite motility in vitro. We concluded that the reported yield, purity, results of biophysical analyses, and stability of PfCSP4/38 warrant further consideration of using the L. lactis system for the production of circumsporozoite proteins for preclinical and clinical applications in malaria vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2992096013,"Antibiotic use in beef cattle is a risk factor for the expansion of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella populations. However, actual changes in the quantity of Salmonella in cattle feces following antibiotic use have not been investigated. Previously, we observed an overall reduction in Salmonella prevalence in cattle feces associated with both ceftiofur crystalline-free acid (CCFA) and chlortetracycline (CTC) use; however, during the same time frame the prevalence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella increased. The purpose of this analysis was to quantify the dynamics of Salmonella using colony counting (via a spiral-plating method) and hydrolysis probe-based qPCR (TaqMan® qPCR). Additionally, we quantified antibiotic-resistant Salmonella by plating to agar containing antibiotics at Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint concentrations. Cattle were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups across 16 pens in 2 replicates consisting of 88 cattle each. Fecal samples from Days 0, 4, 8, 14, 20, and 26 were subjected to quantification assays. Duplicate qPCR assays targeting the Salmonella invA gene were performed on total community DNA for 1,040 samples. Diluted fecal samples were spiral plated on plain Brilliant Green Agar (BGA) and BGA with ceftriaxone (4 μg/ml) or tetracycline (16 μg/ml). For comparison purposes, indicator non-type-specific (NTS) E. coli were also quantified by direct spiral plating. Quantity of NTS E. coli and Salmonella significantly decreased immediately following CCFA treatment. CTC treatment further decreased the quantity of Salmonella but not NTS E. coli. Effects of antibiotics on the imputed log10 quantity of Salmonella were analyzed via a multi-level mixed linear regression model. The invA gene copies decreased with CCFA treatment by approximately 2 log10 gene copies/g feces and remained low following additional CTC treatment. The quantities of tetracycline or ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella were approximately 4 log10 CFU/g feces; however, most of the samples were under the quantification limit. The results of this study demonstrate that antibiotic use decreases the overall quantity of Salmonella in cattle feces in the short term; however, the overall quantities of antimicrobial-resistant NTS E. coli and Salmonella tend to remain at a constant level throughout."
https://openalex.org/W2991253552,"Although the high-fat-diet-induced metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a precursor of human cardiac pathology, the myocardial metabolic state in MetS is far from clear. The discrepancies in metabolite handling between human and small animal models and the difficulties inherent in obtaining human tissue complicate the identification of the myocardium-specific metabolic response in patients. Here we use the large animal model of swine that develops the hallmark criteria of human MetS. Our comparative metabolomics together with transcriptomics and computational nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) interpretation of the data exposes significant decline in metabolites related to the fatty acid oxidation, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathway. Behind the reversal lies decreased expression of enzymes that operate in the pathways. We showed that diminished glycogen deposition is a metabolic signature of MetS in the pig myocardium. The depletion of glycogen arises from disbalance in expression of genes that break down and synthesize glycogen. We show robust acetoacetate accumulation and activated expression of key enzymes in ketone body formation, catabolism and transporters, suggesting a shift in fuel utilization in MetS. A contrasting enrichment in O-GlcNAcylated proteins uncovers hexosamine pathway and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) expression involvement in the myocardial response to MetS. Although the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) activity and the availability of the UDP-GlcNAc substrate in the MetS myocardium is low, the level of O-GlcNacylated proteins is high as the O-GlcNacase is significantly diminished. Our data support the perception of transcriptionally driven myocardial alterations in expression of standard fatty acids, glucose metabolism, glycogen, and ketone body related enzymes and subsequent paucity of their metabolite products in MetS. This aberrant energy metabolism in the MetS myocardium provide insight into the pathogenesis of CVD in MetS."

https://openalex.org/W2990432613,"Early detection of postoperative increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) correlates with postoperative complications. The present study examined the association between preoperative / intraoperative factors and postoperative CRP levels, with development and validation of a prediction model of early postoperative CRP level, for prophylactic management of postoperative complications in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia.Multivariate regression analysis was retrospectively performed to determine the independent factor of CRP levels on postoperative day (POD) 1 and to develop a prediction model. Validation of the prediction model was prospectively performed. Data from 316 adult patients on perioperative variables were retrospectively obtained in a training cohort in patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery. In a validation cohort, 88 patients undergoing mastectomy and 68 patients undergoing laparoscopic colon surgery were prospectively utilized to evaluate the value of the prediction model. Major complications after surgery were defined as the Clavien-Dindo grade IIIa or greater.Duration of surgery, mean nociceptive response (NR) during surgery as intraoperative nociception level, and preoperative CRP level were selected to set up the prediction model of CRP level on POD1 (P < 0.0001). In the validation cohort, the predicted CRP levels on POD1 significantly correlated with the measured CRP after mastectomy (P < 0.0001) and laparoscopic colon surgery (P = 0.0001). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the predicted CRP levels on POD1 was significantly associated with major complications after mastectomy (P = 0.0259) and laparoscopic colon surgery (P = 0.0049). The measured and predicted CRP levels significantly increased in the order of severity of postoperative complications (P < 0.01).Increases in duration of surgery, intraoperative nociceptive level and preoperative CRP level were selected to predict early increases in CRP level after non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia. Predicted CRP levels on POD1 were likely associated with severity of postoperative complications."
https://openalex.org/W2991746080,"A positive interaction between plant populations is a type of population relationship formed during long-term evolution. This interaction can alleviate population competition, improve resource utilization in populations, and promote population harmony and community stability. However, cultivated plant populations may have insufficient time to establish a positive interaction, thereby hindering the formation of the positive interaction. As current studies have not fully addressed these issues, our study established soybean/wheat intercropping populations beneficial for growth and explored the effects of nutrient level and planting density on the positive interaction between the two crops. Changes across population modules in both sole cropping and intercropping populations of soybean and wheat were analyzed. Results using nutrient levels of ½- or ¼-strength Hoagland solution indicated that soybean/wheat intercropping population modules significantly increased at low planting densities (D20 and D26) and significantly decreased at high planting densities (D32 and D60). Therefore, as planting density increased, the modules of both intercropping populations initially increased before decreasing. Similarly, positive interaction initially strengthened before weakening. Moreover, at an intermediate planting density, the population modules reached their maxima, and the positive interaction was the strongest. Under the same planting density, ¼-strength Hoagland solution recorded better growth for the soybean/wheat intercropping population modules compared to results using the ½-strength Hoagland solution. These findings indicated that low nutrient level can increase the positive interaction of intercropping populations at a given planting density, and that environmental nutrient level and population planting densities constrain the positive interaction between soybean and wheat populations in the intercropping system. This study highlights issues that need to be addressed when constructing intercropping populations."
https://openalex.org/W2993505955,"Essential medicines lists and related policies are intended to meet the priority health needs of populations and their implementation is associated with more appropriate use of medicines. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that countries carefully select the medicines to be included in their national essential medicines lists. Lists that are used to prioritize access to important treatments should not include medicines that have been withdrawn elsewhere because of an unfavourable benefit-to-harm balance; however, countries still list and use medicines that have been withdrawn worldwide. The objective of this study was to determine whether the national essential medicines lists of 137 countries include medicines that have been withdrawn in other countries.We performed an audit of national essential medicines lists for medicines that had been withdrawn. Medicines withdrawn from worldwide markets between 1953 and 2014 were identified using a systematic review of published literature and regulatory documents. The reviewers used sources including the WHO's database of drugs, PubMed, and the websites of regulatory agencies to obtain information regarding adverse effects associated with the medicines, the year of first withdrawal, markets of withdrawal, and the level of evidence supporting each withdrawal. We recorded the number of countries with a withdrawn medicine included in their national medicines list, the number of withdrawn medicines included in each nation's list, and the number of national essential medicines including each withdrawn medicine. 97 medicines were withdrawn in at least one country but still included in one more national essential medicines list. Of 137 countries with a national essential medicines list, 136 lists included at least one withdrawn medicine, with 54% of the lists containing 5 or fewer withdrawn medicines, and 27% including 10 or more withdrawn medicines. 11 medicines were withdrawn worldwide but still included on at least one national essential medicines list. Countries with longer essential medicines lists had more withdrawn medicines included in their lists.This study found that withdrawn medicines are included in all but one national essential medicines list, representing a need for more stringent processes for selecting and removing medicines on these lists. Countries may wish to apply special scrutiny to medicines withdrawn in other nations when selecting medicines to include on their lists."
https://openalex.org/W2990149583,"In recent years, natural viewing settings with video presentation have been used in neurological and psychological experiments. However, the experienced cognitive load may differ among participants. In this study, we show that rapid serial blinks (RSB) can indicate temporally increased cognitive load with high temporal resolution. We proposed a method to create a personal criterion for respective participants by using empirical blink intervals. When we focused on more than four serial blinks (i.e., three inter-blink intervals), an increased number of RSB detect participants who felt hard to understanding, indicating a poor understanding of the subject matter. By contrast, a constant criterion across participants used in previous study could not detect participant’s understanding. These results suggest that individual differences in cognitive trait of each participant may skew the results of experiments. To avoid biases, we recommend researchers to perform an operational check on individually different temporally increased cognitive loads among experimental groups."
https://openalex.org/W2994435966,"Community mobilization has been recognized as a critical enabler for HIV prevention and is employed for challenging gender inequalities. We worked together with community partners to implement the 'One Man Can' intervention in rural Mpumalanga, South Africa to promote gender equality and HIV risk reduction. During the intervention, we conducted longitudinal qualitative interviews and focus group discussions with community mobilizers (n = 26), volunteer community action team members (n = 22) and community members (n = 52) to explore their experience of being part of the intervention and their experiences of change associated with the intervention. The objective of the study was to examine processes of change in community mobilization for gender equity and HIV prevention. Our analysis showed that over time, participants referred to three key elements of their engagement with the intervention: developing respect for others; inter-personal communication; and empathy. These elements were viewed as assisting them in adopting a 'better life' and associated with behaviour change in the intervention's main focus areas of promoting gender equality and HIV risk reduction behaviours. We discuss how these concepts relate to the essential domains contained within our theoretical framework of community mobilization-specifically critical consciousness, shared concerns and social cohesion -, as demonstrated in this community. We interpret the focus on these key elements as significant indicators of communities engaging with the community mobilization process and initiating movement towards structural changes for HIV prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2991990617,"Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has been used in analysis of proteins and their post-translational modifications. A recently developed data analysis method, which simulates MS/MS spectra of phosphopeptides and performs spectral library searching using SpectraST, facilitates confident localization of phosphorylation sites. However, its performance has been evaluated only on MS/MS spectra acquired using Orbitrap HCD mass spectrometers so far. In this study, we have investigated whether this approach would be applicable to another type of mass spectrometers, and optimized the simulation and search conditions to achieve sensitive and confident site localization. Synthetic phosphopeptides and enriched K562 cell phosphopeptides were analyzed using a TripleTOF 6600 mass spectrometer before and after enzymatic dephosphorylation. Dephosphorylated peptides identified by X!Tandem database searching were subjected to spectral simulation of all possible single phosphorylations using SimPhospho software. Phosphopeptides were identified and localized by SpectraST searching against a library of the simulated spectra. Although no synthetic phosphopeptide was localized at 1% false localization rate under the previous conditions, optimization of the spectral simulation and search conditions for the TripleTOF datasets achieved the localization and improved the sensitivity. Furthermore, the optimized conditions enabled sensitive localization of K562 phosphopeptides at 1% false discovery and localization rates. These results suggest that accurate phosphopeptide simulation of TripleTOF MS/MS spectra is possible and the simulated spectral libraries can be used in SpectraST searching for confident localization of phosphorylation sites."
https://openalex.org/W2989792882,"The objectives of this study were to examine differences in physical activity behaviors as a function of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status and sex, to test differences in physical activity self-efficacy (PASE), body weight satisfaction (BWS), and enjoyment of physical activity as a function of HIV status, and to determine if PASE, BWS, and enjoyment are associated with daily physical activity (daily PA), muscle strengthening activities, and sedentary behavior of youth with and without HIV. A total of 250 HIV positive (HIV+) and HIV negative (HIV-) youth from Botswana aged 12-23 years (Mean = 17.87, SD = 2.24) participated in the study. The HIV+ group (n = 88) was recruited from a previous 12-month antiretroviral therapy (ART) and nutrition intervention study. The HIV- group (n = 162) was randomly selected from public junior and senior (secondary) high schools in and around Gaborone. Participants' PASE, BWS, enjoyment of physical activity, daily PA, muscle strengthening, body mass index (BMI), and sedentary behavior were obtained using items from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed that the HIV- group (M = 1.20, SE = 0.06, CI = 1.08 to 1.32) had significantly higher daily PA than the HIV+ group (M = 0.99, SE = 0.08, CI = 0.82 to 1.15). The HIV- group (M = 0.91, SE = 0.06, CI = 0.79 to 1.03) also reported participating significantly more in muscle strengthening activities than the HIV+ group (M = 0.63, SD = 0.08, CI = 0.47 to 0.78). Multiple regression analyses showed that higher PASE (p < .001) and greater enjoyment of PA (p < .01) were predictive of higher daily PA. HIV- participants had higher PASE but lower BWS compared to HIV+ participants. Sex and age differences were observed in muscle strengthening activities and sedentary behavior. This study supports previous findings on the association of efficacy beliefs to daily PA and muscle strengthening activities. The findings have implications for PA interventions aimed at health promotion and mitigation of the effects of living with HIV/AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2992156252,"Grazing is the most common land use type for grasslands, and grazing may alter the impacts of the predicted enhancement of nitrogen deposition on soil CH4 flux. To understand the effects of nitrogen addition, grazing, and their interactions on soil CH4 flux, we conducted a field study on CH4 flux in a meadow steppe in Northeast China from 2017 to 2018. We measured the soil CH4 flux and soil physiochemical and vegetation parameters. The studied meadow steppe soil acted as a CH4 source due to the legacy effects of an extreme rainfall event. During the experimental period, the average CH4 fluxes were 7.8 ± 1.0, 5.8 ± 0.5, 9.3 ± 0.9 and 7.6 ± 0.6 μg m-2 h-1 for the CK (control), G (grazing), N (nitrogen addition) and NG (grazing and nitrogen addition) treatments, respectively. The cumulative CH4 fluxes were 24.9 ± 2.6, 11.5 ± 4.9, 28.8 ± 4.2 and 17.8 ± 3.5 μg m-2 yr-1 for the CK, G, N and NG treatments, respectively. The N addition increased the average CH4 flux by 19%, and the grazing treatment reduced it by 25%. The soil CH4 flux was positively correlated with the 0-10 cm soil water filled pore space (P < 0.01), soil NH4+-N (P < 0.01) and soil NO3--N (P < 0.01), but negatively correlated with the 0-10 cm soil temperature (P < 0.01), except for the sampling dates that were strongly influenced by the extreme rainfall event. The average CH4 flux was significantly (P < 0.05) affected by the grazing and N addition treatments with the N addition treatment significantly (P < 0.05) increased the CH4 flux, whereas grazing significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the CH4 flux. Grazing offset the stimulating effects of N addition on CH4 flux, and there was no difference (P = 0.79) in the CH4 flux between the CK and NG plots. In summary, moderate grazing has the potential to reduce the negative impacts of N addition on CH4 flux and can increase the capacity of the soil CH4 sink in the studied meadow steppe."
https://openalex.org/W2989989333,"The Liolaemus montanus group is a diverse group of lizards that ranges from central Peru to southwestern Mendoza, Argentina, including much of the Plurinational State of Bolivia (“Bolivia”) and Chile. The species of this group mainly inhabit high elevation areas with cold temperatures. In the last years, several species of this group have been described, mostly in Argentina and Chile. In Bolivia, there are at least thirteen valid species belonging to the L. montanus group. In this study, we describe a new species of the L. montanus group with a marked endemism in the Cordillera de Sama of the Tarija Department, Bolivia, and a combination of unique character states that allows its formal description as a new species. The phylogenetic relationships based on analysis of 159 morphological characters suggest that it belongs to the L. montanus group, and that it is closest to Liolaemus pulcherrimus, which is found allopatrically in a small area of the Jujuy Province, Argentina. The multivariate analyses of 66 morphological characters support the phylogenetic relationships. Statistical analyses of inter-species comparisons of morphological characters are not considered the only methods due to the non-independence of some characters states among species; thus, a phylogenetic analysis is recommended. The detailed revision of specimens of the L. montanus group held in the collections of Bolivia is filling major geographic gaps and improving our understanding of the phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships of this widely distributed group of South American lizards."
https://openalex.org/W2990519124,"Background Kindergartens represent an important arena for promoting vegetable intake when it is essential to establish healthy dietary behaviours early in life. To develop and implement successful interventions targeting dietary behaviours in kindergartens, a good understanding of the factors influencing their food environment and the interplay between these factors is essential. The present study aimed to explore associations between workplace climate and culture in the kindergarten setting and the staff’s food-related practices, vegetables served and the possible mediating role of staff’s food-related practices. Method Vegetables served, staff’s food-related practices, and data on workplace climate and culture were collected using a 5-day, weighted, vegetable diary and three paper-based questionnaires. Seventy-three kindergartens in the Norwegian counties of Vestfold and Buskerud participated in the study. Spearman’s rho was used to assess the association between workplace climate and culture, and staff’s food-related practices and vegetables served. Mediation analyses were conducted to assess the mediating role of staff’s food-related practices in the relationship between workplace climate and culture and vegetables served in this setting. Results There was one significant positive correlation between factors in the workplace climate and culture, and staff’s food-related practices and vegetables served. The staff’s food-related practices were found to mediate the association between support from superior and the variety of vegetables served. They also mediated the association between commitment to the organization and the frequency, as well as the variety, of vegetables served. Conclusion The results identified commitment to the organization and support from superior as two important factors in the workplace climate and culture. Furthermore, these two factors seems to be important to target when developing kindergarten-based interventions aimed at increasing the variety and frequency of vegetables served as they were associated with more favourable food-related practices among staff."
https://openalex.org/W2990763251,"Neck compression collars have been proposed to reduce injury to the brain caused by head impacts. Our objective was to test if compression of the carotid artery affected the baroreflex and influenced blood pressure control.Cerebrovascular and autonomic responses of healthy young men and women (n = 8 each) to paced deep breathing, Valsalva, and 70o head-up tilt with or without use of a Q-collar were determined. Continuous measurements of heart rate, beat-to-beat blood pressure, transcranial Doppler, and end-tidal gases were obtained. Heart rate variability was measured during supine rest and head-up tilt. Carotid artery and jugular vein cross-sectional area were measured at end-inhalation and end-exhalation using cross-sectional ultrasound images at diastole.Wearing the collar reduced carotid cross-sectional area (CSA; P = 0.022; η2 = 0.03) and increased jugular CSA (P = 0.001; η 2 = 0.30). In both men and women, wearing the collar increased systolic blood pressure during Valsalva (P<0.05; η 2 = 0.38). In only men, wearing the collar resulted in prolonged pressure recovery time during Valsalva (P = 0.02; η 2 = 0.05). In only women, wearing the collar increased baseline diastolic (P = 0.026; η 2 = 0.09) and mean (P = 0.041; η 2 = 0.06) middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocity, which attenuated the normal increase of diastolic (P = 0.01; η 2 = 0.03) and mean (P = 0.038; η 2 = 0.02) MCA blood flow velocity during Valsalva. There were no effects of sex or collar on the responses to deep breathing (P>0.05), and there were no effects of the collar on cerebrovascular function, hemodynamics, cardiovagal baroreceptor sensitivity, or heart rate variability (P>0.05) during upright tilt.Use of the Q-collar compresses both the jugular vein and carotid artery influencing sympathetic nerve activity in both men and women while influencing brain blood flow in women."
https://openalex.org/W2991801902,"This study examined the relationship between urbanization and parasite community structure in the estuarine fish, Fundulus heteroclitus. We measured landscape and physicochemical factors associated with urbanization at 6 sites from 4 collection periods. Concurrently, we quantified the metazoan parasite community in F. heteroclitus collected at those sites, with 105 fish studied per site during the 4 collection periods. Parasite community composition differed among sites. Host size was the most important variable for direct life-cycle parasite assemblages and indirect life-cycle parasites at the individual fish level, while landscape and physicochemical factors determined the structure of indirect life-cycle parasite assemblages at the population scale. Variation in the prevalence and intensity of infection of two indirect life-cycle parasites, Lasiocotus minutus and Glossocercus caribaensis, were the primary parasites that drove differences across sites. Variation in the presence/absence of these indirect life-cycle parasite species was associated with sediment Ni concentrations, patch density, and marsh size. Our data support the hypothesis that urbanization, acting at both landscape and physicochemical scales, can have a significant impact on parasite community structure. This, however, varied by parasite life history: there was little effect of urbanization on the prevalence and intensity of direct life-cycle parasites, but significant variation was detected for indirect life-cycle parasites. This study demonstrates how anthropogenically driven landscape change influences fine-scale population dynamics of parasites."

https://openalex.org/W2992049228,"Hypotrichosis simplex (HS) with and without woolly hair (WH) comprises a group of rare, monogenic disorders of hair loss. Patients present with a diffuse loss of scalp and/or body hair, which usually begins in early childhood and progresses into adulthood. Some of the patients also show hair that is tightly curled. Approximately 10 genes for autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms of HS have been identified in the last decade, among them five genes for the dominant form. We collected blood and buccal samples from 17 individuals of a large British family with HS and WH. After having sequenced all known dominant genes for HS in this family without the identification of any disease causing mutation, we performed a genome-wide scan, using the HumanLinkage-24 BeadChip, followed by a classical linkage analysis; and whole exome-sequencing (WES). Evidence for linkage was found for a region on chromosome 4q35.1-q35.2 with a maximum LOD score of 3.61. WES led to the identification of a mutation in the gene SORBS2, encoding sorbin and SH3 domain containing 2. Unfortunately, we could not find an additional mutation in any other patient/family with HS; and in cell culture, we could not observe any difference between cloned wildtype and mutant SORBS2 using western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses. Therefore, at present, SORBS2 cannot be considered a definite disease gene for this phenotype. However, the locus on chromosome 4q is a robust and novel finding for hypotrichosis with woolly hair. Further fine mapping and sequencing efforts are therefore warranted in order to confirm SORBS2 as a plausible HS disease gene."
https://openalex.org/W2992296366,"To investigate the relationship between visceral fat and the hemodilution effect of carcinoembryonic antigen in both sexes.A total of 15,340 females and 20,024 males who visited the health promotion center at Chung-Ang University Hospital from 2011 to 2014 were retrospectively collected. Correlation analysis and chi-square test for linear by linear association were used to determine the correlation between carcinoembryonic antigen concentration, carcinoembryonic antigen mass and visceral fat. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to calculate the mean of carcinoembryonic antigen concentration and the mean of carcinoembryonic antigen mass, reflecting age, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, body fat percentage, body mass index, lean body mass and waist circumference as confounding variables.Higher body mass index was related with lower carcinoembryonic antigen concentration in men (r = -0.019, P = 0.019), but higher carcinoembryonic antigen concentration in women (r = 0.084, P<0.001). Average of waist circumference for male is greater than that of female (P<0.01). Average of body fat percentage for male is lesser than that of female (P<0.01). Male lean body mass mean is larger than that of women (P<0.01). Increased waist circumference was significantly associated with higher carcinoembryonic antigen mass in both female and male (P<0.001 for trend). Postmenopausal women might be more likely to have increased carcinoembryonic antigen mass and carcinoembryonic antigen concentration (P<0.001 for trend).This study suggests that visceral fat may increase total amount of CEA in the body. Visceral fat should be taken into account when evaluating serum CEA levels in both sexes."
