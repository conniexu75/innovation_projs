https://openalex.org/W2040645020,"The tight junction protein ZO-1 belongs to a family of multidomain proteins known as the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs (MAGUKs). ZO-1 has been demonstrated to interact with the transmembrane protein occludin, a second tight junction-specific MAGUK, ZO-2, and F-actin, although the nature and functional significance of these interactions is poorly understood. To further elucidate the role of ZO-1 within the epithelial tight junction, we have introduced epitope-tagged fragments of ZO-1 into cultured MDCK cells and identified domains critical for the interaction with ZO-2, occludin, and F-actin. A combination of in vitroand in vivo binding assays indicate that both ZO-2 and occludin interact with specific domains within the N-terminal (MAGUK-like) half of ZO-1, whereas the unique proline-rich C-terminal half of ZO-1 cosediments with F-actin. Consistent with these observations, we found that a construct encoding the N-terminal half of ZO-1 is specifically associated with tight junctions, whereas the unique C-terminal half of ZO-1 is distributed over the entire lateral surface of the plasma membrane and other actin-rich structures. In addition, we have identified a 244-amino acid domain within the N-terminal half of ZO-1, which is required for the stable incorporation of ZO-1 into the junctional complex of polarized MDCK cells. These observations suggest that one functional role of ZO-1 is to organize components of the tight junction and link them to the cortical actin cytoskeleton.

The tight junction forms the apical barrier to the paracellular movement of water, solutes and immune cells in polarized epithelia (1Cereijido, M. (ed) ull-92) Tight Junctions, pp. 1–13, CRC, Boca Raton, FLGoogle Scholar). Electron micrographs reveal that the paracellular seal is composed of a series of highly ordered membrane contact sites (2Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 412Crossref Scopus (2132) Google Scholar), which in freeze-fracture micrographs can be visualized as a series of interconnected fibrils within the plasma membrane (3Staehelin L.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1974; 39: 191-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Actin filaments terminate at these membrane contact sites (4Hirokawa N. Tilney L.G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 5Madara J.L. Pappenheimer J.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cytoskeleton is involved in the structural and functional organization of the tight junction. Although many of the molecular components of the tight junction have now been identified, little is known about how they interact to regulate the assembly and permeability of the paracellular barrier. At least one transmembrane component of the tight junction, occludin (6Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar), has been demonstrated to contribute to the paracellular seal in cultured cells (7Balda M.S. Whitney J.A. Flores C.

More recently, investigators have identified two novel transmembrane proteins, claudin-1 and claudin-2, which are also presumably components of the paracellular seal (11Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Both occludin and claudins localize to the discrete membrane contact sites, or kisses, within the freeze-fracture fibrils (6Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). These kisses are in turn intimately associated with the cytosolic plaque proteins ZO-1 (12Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar), ZO-2 (13Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and ZO-3 (14Balda M.S. Gonzales-Mariscal L. Matter L. Contreras R.G. Cereijido M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). These proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated as a complex from cultured epithelial cells (14Balda M.S. Gonzales-Mariscal L.

Nagafuchi F. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Other components of the cytosolic plaque include cingulin (17Citi S. Sabannay H. Jakes R. Geiger B. Kendrick-Jones J. Nature. 1988; 333: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), 7H6 (18Zhong Y. Saitoh T. Minase T. Sawada N. Enomoto K. Mori M. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1003-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The plaque proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 probably play a unique role in the organization/regulation of tight junctions. These proteins are members of a family of membrane-associated signaling proteins known as the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs (MAGUKs), which include the Drosophila tumor suppressor dlg (21Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Dev. Biol. 1989; 134: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), theCaenorhabditis elegans signaling protein LIN2 (22Hoskins R. Hajnal A. Harp S. Kim S.K. Development. 1995; 122: 97-111Google Scholar), synaptic proteins hDlg and PSD95 (23Lue R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1991; 88: 6595-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Members of this family are distinguished by a core cassette of protein-binding domains, which include one or more PSD95/dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains, an SH3 domain, and a region of homology to guanylate kinase (GuK) (27Fanning A.S. Lapierre L.A. Brecher A.R. Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. Curr. Top. Membr. 1996; 43: 211-235Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All of these proteins are associated with cell-cell contact sites such as synapses, intercalated disks, and epithelial tight junctions. Mutations in the genes for Dlg and LIN2 cause severe alteration in cell growth and differentiation (21Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Dev. Biol. 1989; 134: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22Hoskins R. Hajnal A. Harp S. Kim S.K. Development. 1995; 122: 97-111Google Scholar), suggesting that MAGUKs are involved in signal transduction pathways controlling growth and differentiation (27Fanning A.S. Lapierre L.A. Brecher A.R. Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. Curr. Top. Membr. 1996; 43: 211-235Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Anderson J.M. Curr.

Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The role of MAGUKs in signal transduction may be due in large part to the demonstrated ability of these proteins to organize protein complexes at the plasma membrane. There are several examples in which expression of a given MAGUK with its transmembrane binding partner results in clustering of both proteins within the plasma membrane (30Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng S. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar,31Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). This property appears to be due to the presence of multiple protein binding motifs within these proteins, as well as their ability to form heterodimers with other MAGUKs. This organizational capacity may also be enhanced by interactions with the cytoskeleton since hdlg, p55, and the human LIN2 homolog all bind to the actin-binding protein 4.1 via a conserved motif located between the SH3 and GUK domains (23Lue R. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 91: 9818-9822Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar,32Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Many members of this family have been demonstrated to interact directly with ion channels, transmembrane receptors, and known cytosolic signal transduction proteins (34Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1996; 272: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 35Hanada T. Lin L. Chandy K.G.

These observations suggest that MAGUKs can act as a scaffold for signal transduction complexes, organizing cytosolic signaling molecules at the plasma membrane with transmembrane receptors and ion channels. It is likely that the tight junction MAGUKs like ZO-1 have organizational/functional roles analogous to other MAGUKs. ZO-1 binds to several other tight junction components (13Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 16Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi F. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and has also been demonstrated to interact with several known signaling proteins, such as the Ras substrate AF-6 (19Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), heterotrimeric G-proteins (38Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), an unidentified serine kinase (39Balda M.S. Anderson J.M. Matter K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and connexin 43 (40Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12725-12731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). ZO-1 has also been shown to bind directly to F-actin in vitro (41Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of these interactions and their relevance to tight junction assembly is poorly understood. For example, it is not known whether the binding sites for other tight junction proteins reside within the MAGUK-like N-terminal half or within the C-terminal domain, which is unique to tight junction MAGUKs. In addition, although ZO-1 interacts with the cytoskeleton like other MAGUKs, it lacks the band 4.1 binding site found in other members of this family. To better understand the role of MAGUK proteins like ZO-1 in the tight junction, we have used epitope-tagged deletion constructs to map the binding sites for ZO-2, occludin, and F-actin on ZO-1. Furthermore, we have examined how these domains are involved in the assembly of ZO-1 into the tight junction complex. Our results suggest that ZO-1 may serve as a link between the proteins of the tight junction and the actin cytoskeleton. A diagram of the expression constructs used in this study is shown in Fig. 1. To insert an epitope tag on the C terminus of the full-length human ZO-1 (ZO1myc), a 203-base pair fragment of the C terminus was amplified from a ZO-1 cDNA using the sense primer 5′-GAAGATGGTCATACTGTGG-3′, which is complimentary to a sequence 5′ of a unique MscI site in ZO-1, and the antisense primer 5′-GGACTAGTTTACAAGTCCTCTTCAGATATCAGCTTTTGCTCGGCAAAGTGGTCAATAAGGACAG-3′. This antisense primer contained a 20-base pair region of homology to ZO-1 (bold) followed by a sequence encoding an alanine linker, an 11-amino acid epitope from the c-Myc protein, a stop codon, and aSpeI restriction enzyme site. This product was amplified using Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), digested withMscI and SpeI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and subcloned into a pSK+ Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing ZO-1, which had been digested with MscI and SpeI to remove the 203-base pair sequence encoding the native C terminus. All C-terminal deletion constructs were produced using a variation of this technique. N-terminal deletion constructs were produced by digesting ZO1myc with restriction enzymes that removed specific DNA sequences (for example amino acids 2–156 for del 2–156), and replacing those sequences with an annealed pair of complimentary oligonucleotides that reestablish the appropriate reading frame. Exact details of plasmid construction are available from the authors by request. The pSK+ Bluescript constructs described here were subsequently digested with KpnI and SpeI and subcloned into the KpnI and XbaI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pCB6 (Karl Matter, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). MDCK cells were obtained from Michael Caplan (Yale University, New Haven, CT) and maintained as described previously (14Balda M.S. Gonzales-Mariscal L. Matter L. Contreras R.G. Cereijido M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Expression constructs were introduced into cells using a variation on standard calcium-phosphate mediated transfection (42Chen C.A. Okayama A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the isolation of stably transfected lines, cells were selected in 1.0 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Colonies were isolated using cloning loops and subsequently analyzed for transgene expression by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting with the anti-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10. In all assays, transgene expression was induced by supplementing the normal growth medium with 5.0 mm sodium butyrate. To examine the interactions between ZO-1 and ZO-2, two 60-mm dishes of transfected MDCK cells were placed on ice, washed twice with PBS, and incubated for 30 min in 1.0 ml of extraction/binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm benzamidine, 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml antipain). Cell lysates were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and clarified for 30 min at 18,000 ×g. The supernatants were mixed with 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), incubated for 2.0 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 1 min at 500 × g. Supernatants were then transferred to a new tube, mixed with 5 μl of the anti-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10, and incubated for 2–15.0 h at 4 °C. Following this incubation, 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Protein A-Sepharose were added and incubated for 2.0 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed three times in extraction/binding buffer, once in extraction/binding buffer without Triton X-100 or SDS, and resuspended in 50 μl of 2× gel sample buffer (43Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). These immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and analyzed by Western blotting using standard techniques (43Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Filters were incubated for 2.0 h in a 1:2500 dilution of the anti-ZO-2 polyclonal antiserum R9989, and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The same filters were then stripped (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of the anti-myc ascites 9E10 or a 1:300 dilution of a culture supernatant from the anti-ZO-1 hybridoma R40.76. To assess the binding of different epitope-tagged proteins to occludin, confluent monolayers of transfected MDCK cells were washed twice with PBS+ (containing 1.0 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mm MgCl2) and lysed in extraction/binding buffer as described for ZO-2 co-immunoprecipitations. The supernatants were then transferred to a new tube, mixed with 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of GST beads, and incubated for 2.0 h at 4 °C. The GST beads were sedimented by a quick pulse in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. A GST fusion protein encoding aa 358–504 of chicken occludin (GST-occ) (44Fallon M.B. Brecher A. Balda M.S. Matter K. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 260: C1057-C1062Crossref Google Scholar) was prepared as described by Ausubel et al. (43Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar), and 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of GST-occ was added to the supernatant and incubated overnight (12–18 h) at 4 °C. The GST-occ beads were then washed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with the 9E10 sera. Cells were plated into 100-mm dishes at confluent density, grown for 2 days, and induced for 20 h with 5.0 mm sodium butyrate. For each construct, two dishes of cells were washed twice with PBS+ and scraped on ice into 1.0 ml of a hypotonic carbonate buffer consisting of 10 mm sodium carbonate (pH 11.0), 1.0 mm K-EGTA, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (∼50 strokes), and the resulting lysate was clarified at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4°/C. The pH of the resulting supernatant was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of 9.0 μl of 1.0 m HCl and 20 μl of 1.0 m Tris (pH 7.0) before being used in cosedimentation assays. To polymerize F-actin, G-actin stocks (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) were diluted to 2.5 mg/ml in binding buffer (10 mmimidazole, pH 7.2, 75 mm KCl, 5.0 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), incubated for 30 min on ice, and stabilized by adjusting to 25 μg/ml phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). F-actin, at a final concentration of 22 μm, was mixed with 60 μl of the cell lysate in binding buffer in a final volume of 200 μl and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were subsequently spun at 100,000 ×g for 20 min. Binding was tested in the presence or absence of 2.0 mm ATP (Boehringer Mannheim) and/or 5.0 μm myosin subfragment-1 (S1) (Sigma) as indicated in the legend of Fig. 7. Gel samples were prepared as described previously (45Fanning A.S. Wolenski J.S. Mooseker M.S. Izant J.G. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 29: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and examined by Western blotting with the 9E10 antisera. To analyze the distribution of the epitope-tagged proteins in immature and mature cell-cell contacts, clonal cell lines expressing these constructs were plated at 80% confluence (106 cells/ml) onto acid-washed 12-mm circular coverslips and induced for 12 h with 5.0 mm sodium butyrate starting 24–72 h after plating, as indicated in figure legend. Alternatively, 106 cells were plated onto 12-mm Transwell filter inserts (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA), incubated for 10 days, and induced for 24 h with 5.0 mm butyrate. Coverslips or filter inserts were then washed briefly with PBS+ and fixed in freshly prepared 1.0% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Subsequently, coverslips were permeabilized for 15 min with a solution of 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 2.0% donkey serum in PBS, incubated with 2.0% donkey serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in PBS for 60 min, and finally incubated for 2.0 h with an undiluted cell supernatant from the 9E10 hybridoma supplemented with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, 1:40 dilution), a rat monoclonal antibody against ZO-1 (R40.76 cell supernatant, 1:10 dilution), or a rabbit polyclonal against human occludin (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA). Following incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA), coverslips were mounted on glass slides (Corning) in Vectashield antifade solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were viewed on a Nikon Microfot FX microscope using a 60× PlanApo lens and photographed using Kodak TMAX 400 film. Alternatively, slides were viewed using a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope on a Zeiss Axiovert using a 63× PlanApo lens. Film images were digitized using a Sprintscan slide scanner (Polaroid, Cambridge, MA). Figures were assembled using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA). ZO-1 can be divided into an N-terminal half, which constitutes the region of homology to other members of the MAGUK family, and a unique proline-rich C-terminal half. Each of these halves contains several previously identified protein domains whose specific roles are unknown in ZO-1 (46Willott E. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Jameson B. Van Itallie C. Anderson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). To address the functional role of these domains in protein binding and tight junction assembly, we created a panel of myc epitope-tagged expression constructs which encode overlapping fragments of human ZO-1 (Fig. 1; see “Experimental Procedures”) and introduced these constructs into cultured MDCK epithelial cells. One of the first molecular interactions to be defined at the tight junction was that between ZO-1 and ZO-2. These proteins can be coimmunoprecipitated from epithelial cell extracts (Fig. 2) under relatively stringent conditions, suggesting a tight and possibly direct interaction (13Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 15Gumbiner B. Lowenkopf T. Apatira D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, if ZO-1 does bind directly to ZO-2, then the striking homology between these two proteins (53% identity between human ZO-1 and ZO-2) suggests that these proteins might also form homodimers in vivo. To address these questions and further elucidate the interaction between ZO-1 and ZO-2, the epitope-tagged fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates of transfected MDCK cells. The immunoprecipitates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies recognizing the endogenous canine ZO-1 and ZO-2 to identify which constructs coprecipitated either of these proteins (Fig. 2). We found that all of the constructs used expressed a polypeptide of the appropriate apparent molecular weight (Fig. 2,myc). In addition, the full-length epitope-tagged construct, ZO1myc, was targeted to the tight junction (discussed below), indicating that the myc epitope does not interfere with these properties of ZO-1. Analysis of the epitope tag immunoprecipitates with an antibody (R40.76) that recognizes only the endogenous canine ZO-1 isoform (Fig. 2, ZO-1), and not the transfected human polypeptide, indicates that the endogenous protein does not coimmunoprecipitate with the full-length epitope-tagged ZO-1 construct under these conditions, nor does it interact with any of the deletion constructs. This result strongly suggests that ZO-1 does not form homodimers in vivo, but instead forms a simple “αβ” heterodimer with ZO-2. When the same blots were probed with a polyclonal antisera against ZO-2, we found that only deletion constructs which still contained the second PDZ domain of ZO-1 (PDZ2) could coprecipitate the endogenous ZO-2 polypeptide (Fig. 2, ZO-2). Furthermore, a construct in which only PDZ2 was specifically deleted (del 159–252) also fails to coprecipitate ZO-2. These results, summarized in Fig. 1, indicate that the PDZ2 domain mediates the interaction with ZO-2. Furuse et al. (16Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi F. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) have identified a ZO-1 binding site within the C-terminal aa 358–504 of chicken occludin, and have established that this domain binds directly to the full-length ZO-1 polypeptide. To identify the reciprocal occludin binding site on ZO-1, we performed binding assays between the epitope-tagged ZO-1 constructs and a GST fusion protein encoding this 146-aa domain. Total lysates from MDCK cells transfected with the epitope-tagged cDNA constructs (Fig. 3 A, total) were incubated with the immobilized GST-occludin (GST-occ) fusion protein, and the myc-tagged proteins bound to the GST fusion protein were identified by Western blotting with the anti-myc antisera (Fig. 3 A, bound). The relative amount of protein binding to GST-occ was assessed by comparing the amount of myc-tagged protein in the bound fraction to that in the total lysate or unbound fraction. In all cases, the expression of deletion constructs was identical to or greater than that of the full-length construct ZO1myc. An initial comparison of tagged constructs encoding the N- and C-terminal halves of ZO-1 (z1–876 and del 67–1033, respectively) indicates that only the N-terminal half of ZO-1 associates with the GST-occ fusion protein (Fig. 3 A). Progressive C-terminal deletions beyond aa 876 severely diminish the ability to associate with GST-occ (Fig. 3 B). For example, no binding is detected with the constructs z1–412, z1–549, and z1–572. These observations suggest that sequences within the 305-aa domain between aa 572 and 876 mediate a strong interaction with occludin (Fig. 1). The binding site can be further refined from the observation that the construct del 294–633 also binds to the GST-occ fusion protein. Interactions with PDZ1 (del 2–156), PDZ2 (del 159–252, del 1–245), PDZ3 (del 294–633), and the SH3 domain (del 550–603) do not appear to be required for binding to occludin (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the primary occludin binding site resides within the 244-aa domain between aa 633 and 876 (Fig. 1). To determine the contribution of the N-terminal half, which interacts with ZO-2 and occludin, and the unique C-terminal half of ZO-1 t"

Herbimycin A, a drug that binds to Hsp90, induces the destruction of tyrosine kinases and causes the down-regulation of cyclin D and an Rb-dependent growth arrest in the G1phase of the cell cycle. We find that the induction of D-cyclin expression by serum and its repression by herbimycin A are regulated at the level of mRNA translation. Induction of cyclin D by serum occurs prior to the induction of its mRNA and does not require transcription. Herbimycin A repression is characterized by a decrease in the synthetic rate of D-cyclins prior to changes in mRNA expression and in the absence of changes in the half-life of the protein. This effect on D-cyclin translation is mediated via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)-dependent pathway. PI 3-kinase inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of FRAP/TOR, cause a decline in the level of D-cyclins, whereas inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and farnesyltransferase do not. Cells expressing the activated, myristoylated form of Akt kinase, a target of PI 3-kinase, are refractory to the effects of herbimycin A or serum starvation on D-cyclin expression. These data suggest that serum induction of cyclin D expression results from enhanced translation of its mRNA and that this results from activation of a pathway that is dependent upon PI 3-kinase and Akt kinase.

Growth factors elicit their biological effects by activating a complex network of receptors and signaling pathways. Activation of transmembrane tyrosine kinases by serum or polypeptide growth factors results in the transit of cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle into S-phase. Several lines of evidence suggest that the D-type cyclins and their associated kinases (Cdks)1 are among the targets of these growth signals (1Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem.

Cellular stress results in the loss of cyclin D1 expression, with a concomitant arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (8Miyatake S. Nakano H. Park S.Y. Yamazaki T. Tadase K. Matsushime H. Kato A.

The networks of pathways responsible for the transduction of these signals are complex and not completely understood. There is some evidence suggesting that a Ras- and MAP kinase-dependent signaling pathway is involved. Expression of activated Ras is associated with the increased expression of cyclin D1 in both epithelial cells (12Filmus J. Robels A.L. Shi W. Wong M.J. Colombo L.L. Conti C.J.

Moreover, in the absence of growth factors, activation of the Raf1 → MEK → MAP kinase pathway has been shown to be sufficient to induce cyclin D1 transcription (5Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A.

We found that treatment of tumor cells with this drug causes a decrease in the expression of D-type cyclins and an Rb-dependent G1block. 2N. Rosen, manuscript in preparation. We report here that the reduction in the level of D-type cyclins induced by herbimycin A is due to inhibition of translation of cyclin D mRNAs. Furthermore, the increase in the level of D-type cyclins in cells treated with serum is due to an increase in the translation of their mRNAs. These effects are due to the regulation of a PI 3-kinase/Akt kinase-dependent, Raf1- and MAP kinase-independent pathway. This pathway is activated by serum and is blocked by the drug herbimycin A. Colo205, a human colon carcinoma cell line, and MCF7, a breast cancer cell line, were obtained from ATCC, and maintained in RPMI or DMEM-F12, respectively, supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin. MCF10A, a nontransformed human mammary epithelial cell line obtained from Dr. J. Mendelsohn (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY), was maintained in DMEM-F12 containing 8% donor horse serum, glutamine, and penicillin and streptomycin as above, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 μg/ml insulin (Collaborative Biomedical Science), 20 ng/ml EGF (Collaborative Biomedical Science), and 1 μg/ml amphotericin (Sigma). MCF10A were serum-starved in DMEM-F12 supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin as above plus 0.1% donor horse serum for 48 h. The cells were stimulated for the times indicated in the text with the media described above. DLD1 tetracycline-repressible cells were maintained in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 400 μg/ml G418, 2.5 μg/ml puromycin, 2.0 μg/ml tetracycline, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin. Herbimycin A (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used at a concentration of 500 μg/ml or as indicated in the text. Farnesyltransferase inhibitor L-744,832 was a gift from Drs. N. Kohl and A. Oliff at Merck (West Point, PA) and was used at a concentration of 20 μm. Rapamycin and wortmannin (Sigma) were used at a concentration of 250 or 200 nm, respectively. Treated cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Nonidet P-40 Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μm each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor) for 10 min on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by a BCA protein assay reagent using the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting. Blots were blocked in Blotto (5% nonfat dry milk in TS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH7.4)) plus 0.1% Tween 20, and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against cyclin D1 or D3, or Cdk2 (Santa Cruz Technologies) overnight at 4 °C. After washing twice for 10 min in TS plus 0.1% Tween 20, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was applied and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and the blots washed twice for 10 min with TS plus 0.1% Tween 20 and developed using ECL Reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For pulse-labeling experiments, 4 × 106 cells/100-mm plate were pre-incubated in RPMI without cysteine or methionine supplemented with 8% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 20 min and pulse-labeled for the indicated times by addition of 250 μCi of Promix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For pulse-chase experiments, pulses were performed as above, media was removed, and chase media (normal growth media containing 10 μg/ml l-methionine; Sigma), was added and allowed to incubate for the times indicated in the text. Cell lysates were prepared as described above, and equal amounts of total protein were immunoprecipitated using 5 μl of the cyclin D3 polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were pelleted, washed once with Nonidet P-40 Lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× sample buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, dried, exposed to x-ray film, and quantitated using a Fuji phosphoimaging system. Total RNA was isolated using an RNAsol B RNA isolation kit by procedures supplied by the manufacturer (Biotecx).

Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The D1 and D3 subclones were linearized with EcoRI, and 36B4 subclone was linearized withPvuII. The linearized glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was a gift from Dr. D. Hochhauser (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). 32P-Labeled antisense probes were synthesized according to the manufacturer (Promega). The specific activity of the 36B4 internal control was adjusted by increasing the amount of cold nucleotide and was empirically determined to be within the linear range of the assay. RNase protection analysis was performed as described previously (16Lebwohl D.E. Muise-Helmericks R.C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Serve S. Timaul M. Bol R. Borgen P. Rosen N. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1925-1929PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cpm of each probe was hybridized to 30 μg of total RNA overnight at 50 °C. Hybridization reactions were digested with a combination of RNase A (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and RNase T1(Life Technologies, Inc.). After ethanol precipitation, the samples were resuspended in formamide loading buffer and resolved by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gels. The gels were dried, exposed to x-ray film, and quantitated using a Fuji phosphoimaging system or a Bio-Rad molecular imaging system. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged c-Akt and myrAkt were cloned into the retroviral vector pMV12-SRα. Retroviral vectors were propagated by transient co-transfection into COS cells with a packaging plasmid. Retroviral infections were performed by treating MCF7 cell monolayers with 40 μg/ml DEAE-dextran for 1 h and then incubating with viral stocks overnight. G418 was added to 500 μg/ml, and resistant colonies were pooled. Akt kinase assays were performed as described previously (28Franke T.F. Yang S. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cellular lysate, treated as described in the text, was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody (Babco) and used in a kinase assay with histone H2B as the exogenous substrate. The tetracycline system plasmids pUHD15–1 neo and pUHD10–3 as described (29Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar) were used. HA-tagged Akt was cloned into the pUHD10–3 vector at the EcoRI site. DLD1 cells expressing the tTA gene (pUHD15–1 neo) were obtained from T. Papas (30Huang C.C. Papas T.S. Bhat N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and were transfected with pUHD10–3/Akt plasmids and MSCVpac (31Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Single colony clones of tet-inducible Akt were isolated following selection with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Herbimycin A caused a G1 arrest in multiple cell lines, which was preceded by a decrease in the expression of cyclins D1 and D3 (data not shown and Fig. 1). Fig. 1 A shows the effects of herbimycin A on D-cyclin and PI 3-kinase (p85) expression in two Rb-positive cell lines. Neither cell line expressed cyclin D2 protein or mRNA (data not shown). In MCF7, a breast carcinoma cell line, cyclin D1 and D3 levels were reduced to 30% and 50% of control levels, respectively, by 24 h of drug treatment. In the nontransformed mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A, the decline in D-type cyclins occurred more rapidly: 50% reduction by 3 h of HA treatment. The p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was unaffected by herbimycin A treatment in both cell lines. To determine whether the decrease in cyclin D protein levels results from a decrease in mRNA levels, RNase protection analyses were performed. These results are shown in Fig. 1 B. Neither cyclin D1 nor D3 mRNA levels were affected by herbimycin A treatment of MCF7 cells. In MCF10A cells, cyclin D1 mRNA levels were reduced to 50% of the control at 9–12 h of drug treatment; cyclin D3 mRNA levels were unchanged. Fig. 1 C shows a summary of the quantitation of these results. In both cell lines tested, a reduction in D-type cyclin protein levels preceded the effect, if any, on the corresponding transcript. These results suggest that the primary effect of herbimycin A on cyclin D levels is at the post-transcriptional level. Changes in steady state protein levels can be accomplished by alterations in either the rate of synthesis or in protein half-life. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of MCF7 cells with herbimycin A specifically decreased the incorporation of labeled amino acids into cyclin D3. The drug reduced the rate of incorporation into cyclin D3 by approximately 50%, while isotope incorporation into total protein synthesis remained unaffected. Chase experiments were performed in MCF7 cells, following a 45-min pulse labeling (Fig. 3 A, Control) and showed that the half-life of cyclin D3 was approximately 2 h (Fig. 3 B). This half-life was unaffected when the chase media contained herbimycin A, or when the cells were pretreated with herbimycin A for 6 h and chased with herbimycin A-containing media (Fig. 3 A). The pulse-chase experiment was repeated using a 10-min pulse, and the half-life was identical (data not shown). These results indicate that herbimycin A affects cyclin D3 expression by reducing its rate of synthesis. Given that the commercially available antibodies against cyclin D1 were inadequate for immunoprecipitation, we were unable to confirm that herbimycin A also affected the synthesis of cyclin D1.Figure 3Effect of herbimycin A on cyclin D3 protein turnover.

This could reflect a direct effect of herbimycin A on the translational machinery or result from inhibition of signaling pathways such as those initiated by tyrosine kinase activation. Herbimycin A inhibits tyrosine kinase signaling by inducing the degradation of TKs and of Raf1 (18Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Lebwohl D.E. Vinitsky A. Rosen N. J. Biol.

MCF10A is an immortalized, untransformed human mammary epithelial cell line, which requires growth factors and hormone supplements for proliferation and arrests in G1 when deprived of growth factors (32Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, addition of complete media to serum- and growth factor-starved MCF10A cells caused a 7-fold increase in the amount of cyclin D1 and a 3-fold increase in cyclin D3 proteins within 12 h. RNase protection analyses shown in Fig. 4 B indicate that although the cyclin D1 message was increased almost 2-fold, this increase occurred at approximately 12 h, much later than the increase in protein level. The background hybridization due to the internal control is indicated by the asterisks. When compared with the internal control, cyclin D3 mRNA levels remained unchanged during the 12-h time period tested. Quantitation of these results is shown in Fig. 4 C. To confirm the contribution of a post-transcriptional component to the induction of cyclin D protein levels, additional serum induction experiments were performed. The pulse-labeling experiment shown in Fig. 5 A indicates that the synthesis of cyclin D3 was increased 13-fold over the control 6 h after addition of fresh media to serum-starved MCF10A cells. Treatment of these cells with actinomycin D had little effect on the induction of cyclin D1 or D3 by serum, whereas the induction of c-Fos, which is transcriptionally controlled, was completely inhibited (Fig. 5 B). Early induction of cyclin D1 was not affected by actinomycin D treatment. However, the level of expression was slightly reduced after 6 h of treatment as compared with the control. The magnitude of cyclin D3 induction was also slightly reduced in the presence of actinomycin D. Although these results do not preclude a transcriptional component, they confirm that the induction of cyclin D by serum results from a post-transcriptional mechanism.Figure 5Growth factors cause an increase in the rate of D-type cyclin protein synthesis.

Treatment of MCF7 cells with the MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 for increasing amounts of time (33Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Growth arrest induced by treatment with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor was also not associated with a down-regulation of D-cyclins (data not shown). This was true in multiple cell lines, including those with wild-type Ras such as MCF7 and Colo205 and in v-Ha-rastransformants of MCF10A and NIH3T3 cells. The effects of wortmannin and LY294002, inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase-related protein TOR/FRAP, were also assessed (35Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V.

As shown in Fig. 6 B, treatment of MCF7 cells with either 250 nm rapamycin or 200 nm wortmannin, a concentration that specifically inhibits PI 3-kinase, or 50 nm LY294002 caused the down-regulation of both cyclin D1 and cyclin D3. Since rapamycin is immunosuppressive, we also tested the effect of rapamycin on a lymphoid cell line. Treatment of Jurkat cells with rapamycin caused the down-regulation of cyclin D3; however, cyclin D2 levels were unaffected (data not shown). Quantitation of these results is shown in Fig. 6 C. Rapamycin, wortmannin, and LY294002 treatment down-regulated D-type cyclins to approximately 50% of the control by 5–8 h of treatment while the MEK inhibitor had no effect. The Akt kinase is a downstream target of PI 3-kinase and is activated by platelet-derived growth factor, EGF, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor (28Franke T.F. Yang S. Chan T.O. Datta K.

Obesity, an increasing health problem in wealthy societies, has been causatively linked to hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. Adipose cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia occur as the ultimate consequence of a disequilibrium in energy balance and exert adverse effects on longevity (1Kushner R.F. Nutr.

Several causal genetic determinants responsible for spontaneous monogenic obesity in mice (ob, db, tub, A r, and fat genes) have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 3Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). In humans, a limited number of obese syndromes have been related to single gene disorders (e.g.Ahlstrom, Bardet Biedl, Cohen, Prader Willi). Recently, two mutations, affecting the leptin signal transduction pathway and leading to human early onset morbid obesity, have been characterized. They affect theob gene (4Montague C.T. Farooqi I.S. Whitehead J.P. Soos M.A. Rau H. Wareham N.J. Sewter C.P. Digby J.E. Mohammed S.N. Hurst J.A. Cheetham C.H. Earley A.R. Barnett A.H. Prins J.B. O'Rahilly S.

A mutation in the human prohormone convertase 1 gene, leading to childhood obesity, has been documented (6Jackson R.S. Creemers J.W. Ohagi S. Raffin-Sanson M.L. Sanders L. Montague C.T. Hutton J.C. O'Rahilly S. Nat.

Proconvertases act, proximally to carboxypeptidase E, in the pathway of post-translational processing of prohormones and neuropeptides, therefore associating this syndrome with the fat/fat murine phenotype. Prevalence of these mutations in the human obese population was reported as being rather limited (4Montague C.T. Farooqi I.S. Whitehead J.P. Soos M.A. Rau H. Wareham N.J. Sewter C.P. Digby J.E.

Consequently, the etiology of numerous human obesity syndromes remains elusive. Results using transgenic models engineered to alter fat mass through manipulation of a specific metabolic protein or to alter energy intake or energy expenditure have been recently reviewed (9Morin C.L. Eckel R.H. Nutr. Biochem. 1997; 8: 702-706Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). They have reemphasized that obesity is most frequently a polygenic disorder. Considerable evidence points to the contribution of multiple genetic determinants to human obesity (10Bouchard C. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1532-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,11Naggert J. Harris T. North M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Additionally, the recent and rapid emergence of the obesity pandemic underlines the role of environmental factors. Although several transcription factors can promote adipogenesis, their direct implication in mammalian obesity remains to be fully substantiated (3Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Among them, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ),1 a nuclear receptor activated by the insulin-sensitizing drugs thiazolidinediones and oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (12Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G.A. Chen H. Evans R.

Among PP are the widely prescribed lipid-lowering drugs of the fibrate (phenoxyisobutyrate) class. When administrated to rodents, the PP that are not genotoxic produce a liver-specific stereotypical response resulting in peroxisomal proliferation, hepatomegaly, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma (18Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In humans, peroxisome proliferation and hepatocarcinoma are not observed, while beneficial serum triglyceride and cholesterol lowering by fibrates is retained (19Balfour J.A. McTavish D. Heel R.C. Drugs. 1990; 40: 260-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PP trigger the coordinate transcriptional gene modulation of an array of proteins located in diverse cellular compartments (e.g. microsomal cytochrome P450 4A (20Johnson E.F. Palmer C.N. Griffin K.J.

These observations established the pivotal role of PPARα in the regulation of lipid oxidation (peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation, microsomal ω-hydroxylation). Additionally, PPARα influences lipid trafficking by altering the gene expression of lipoproteine lipase and apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) in the liver, thus leading to a significant serum triglyceride lowering (27Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 1996; 3: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, PPARα could represent a key mediator of lipid homeostasis, as a physiological sensor of lipid levels (16Kliewer S.A Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar) and a molecular regulator of an array of lipid metabolism-related genes. Generation of PPARα knockout mice (PPARα −/−) established that the receptor is a prerequisite for hepatic peroxisome proliferation and coordinate induction of acyl-coenzyme A oxidase, bifunctional enzyme, thiolase, cytochrome P450 4A 1/3, and liver fatty acid-binding protein genes by clofibrate (29Lee S.S-T.

Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the role of PPARα in the duration of the inflammatory response induced by leukotriene B4, a bona fide natural ligand of the receptor, was confirmed in these mice (15Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). This model, which exhibits reduced levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), was thoroughly investigated under pharmacological conditions of treatment by the extremely potent PP Wy 14,643 (31Peters J.M.

An additional set of hepatic genes (apoA-I, apoC-III) was shown to be under PPARα-dependent modulation by PP, suggesting a causal link with the hypotriglyceridemic capability of fibrates. Nevertheless, a provocative paradigm remained: how to reconcile the putative influence of PPARα on lipid metabolism with the absence of a documented, naturally occurring, null phenotype. In the absence of any pharmacological influence, our experimental procedures were designed to substantiate putative pathophysiological traits observed in both sexes. We report that PPARα deficiency leads to an original form of monogenic, late onset, spontaneous obesity with a stable caloric intake and a remarkable sexual dimorphism. The specificity and extrapolation of this phenotype will be discussed. Care of mice was according to institutional guidelines. PPARα −/− mice originated from homologous recombinant 129Sv-derived cells. Chimeric males were initially backcrossed to C57BL/6 females. For the purpose of this study, several additional rounds of backcrossing were performed in our animal facility to increase the C57BL/6 genetic background (common to several murine obese phenotypes) and to generate the animals used. We developed an original PCR-based animal screening, using a set of primers located at both ends of exon 8 of the PPARα gene that amplified either 200 bp (wild type) or 1250 bp (knockout) from tail DNA (forward, 5′-ATCGGCCTGGCCTTCTAAAC-3′; backward, 5′-GTCTCTGTAGATCTCTTGC-3′). Mice were housed in conventional conditions, under 12 h/12 h dark/light cycles, each group being divided in two cages of five animals each. Sampling of animals was designed to reduce the influence of interfering parameters such as parental imprinting or litter specificity. C57BL/6 controls were from IFFA-CREDO (Les Oncins, France). Mice received a regular chow diet, 3200 kcal/kg (UAR, Epinay, France) containing 4.5% lipids. Water and food were available ad libitum. Prior to phenobarbital anesthesia and euthanasia, blood was collected at the orbital sinus. Upon collection, serum samples were stabilized (32Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and stored 16 h at 4 °C prior to analysis. Serum lipids were evaluated as a single batch of samples on a Cobas FARA apparatus (Roche, Paris) using biochemical reagents (Bio-Merieux, Marcy l'Etoile). Hepatic lipids were extracted from liquid nitrogen-frozen samples from the same anatomical site (liver large lobe) and analyzed by gas chromatography (cholesterol) and biochemical test (triglycerides) (Bio-Merieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) according to published protocols (33Bligh E.G. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Following euthanasia, livers were dissected, and fragments of the large lobe were treated by a formaldehyde solution (10% in 1× phosphate-buffered saline) for 48 h prior to paraffin embedding. Hematoxilin/eosin-stained sections were 5 μm thick, while frozen sections for oil red-O staining, embedded in Tissue-Teck (Miles, Inc., Kankakee, IL), were 15 μm thick. In situ liver dissociation was performed by collagenase perfusion according to published protocols (34Aiken J. Cima L. Schloo B. Mooney D. Johnson L. Langer R. Vacanti J.P. J. Pediatr. Surg. 1990; 25: 140-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) except that solutions and media were buffered with Hepes (pH 7.4). Flow rates for rinsing solution and dissociation solution were 5 and 4 ml/min, respectively. Cells resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium following filtration on a sterilized gauze were centrifuged (3 min, 120 ×g); fat-loaded cells were collected as a distinct top ring. Total RNA was prepared from 100 μg of fresh fragments of liver large lobe or 300 μl of dissociated cell suspension, homogenized in 1 ml of Trizol solution (Life Technologies, Paris) using a tissue homogenizer (Ika, Jena, Germany) with a 7-mm diameter probe. Four μg of RNAs were reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and 250 ng were used for PCR with Taq polymerase (enzymes from Life Technologies). Mouse primer sequences and PCR parameters were as follows: PPARγ2, 5′-TGTTGACCCAGAGCATGTGCCTT-3′ (forward, PPARγ2-specific) and 5′-TCGTGTAGATGATCTCATGGACACCA-3′ (reverse, shared with PPARγ1) for 38 cycles; LHS, 5′-GCACTTCTGGAAAGCCTTCTGG-3′ (forward, exon 3) and 5′-GAAGGAGTTGAGCCATGAGGAGG-3′ (reverse, exon 7) for 45 cycles; aP2, 5′-ATGTGTGATGCCTTTGTGGGAACCTG-3′ (forward, exon 1) and 5′-CTCTTGTGGAAGTCACGCCTTTCA-3′ (reverse, exon 4) for 37 cycles; adipoQ, 5′-TGCAAGCTCTCCTGTTCCTCTTAACC-3′(forward) and 5′-TAGAGTCCCGGAATGTTGCAGTAGAAC-3′ (reverse) for 45 cycles; and rat albumin, 5′-CCTAGTCCTGATTGCCTTTTCCCAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCAACAAAGTCAGCAGCTATTGAGGG-3′ (reverse) for 40 cycles. Following gel electrophoresis and transfer on Gene Screen Plus membrane (DuPont, Les Ulis, France), hybridization was performed with random priming radiolabeled specific cDNA probes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France). Autoradiograms were quantified with a scanner (Bioimage, Roissy, France). We randomly selected control and deficient mice from different litters for the purpose of this study. They were kept under identical conditions of housing and feeding and received a standard mouse chow diet (3200 kcal/kg) suitable for reproduction. Under these conditions, 7–11-week-old PPARα −/− mice, like those investigated in previous reports (29Lee S.S-T. Pineau T. Drago J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H.

Surprisingly, an apparent obesity developed specifically among 6–12-month-old breeders of the PPARα deficient colony kept under standard dietary conditions. To substantiate our supposition of a delayed pathophysiological trait in the PPARα −/− mice, we implemented a protocol aimed at monitoring the body weight gain relative to food intake and the adipose tissue mass at various critical locations (36Cummings D.E.

Weekly recordings of individual weight during 8 months revealed an increased body growth rate for PPARα-deficient mice compared with controls and a marked sexual dimorphism in the kinetics of weight gain (Fig. 1). By the age of 219 days, weight differences between PPARα −/− mice and controls were 40 and 18.6% for females and males, respectively. A durable, statistically significant difference of body weight was established between females of both genotypes by 69 days, while it occurred only at 168 days for males. Statistical analysis of daily food intake monitoring indicated no increase of caloric intake in PPARα −/− animals compared with wild type, when expressed per gram of body weight (Fig. 1). Relative body weight increase among aged PPARα-deficient animals was obvious with 200-day-old females (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Top, female PPARα knockout mice (right) display morphological signs of obesity when compared with age-matched (200 days) wild type C57BL/6 control (left).

Additionally, the liver and the interscapular brown adipose tissue were dissected. We compared the adipose tissue mass from PPARα-deficient mice to those from wild type controls for all samples and expressed it as a percentage of the wild type tissue mass (Table I). We observed that, with a single exception (male retroperitoneal white adipose tissue), all fat tissues from the various anatomical sites, including the interscapular brown adipose tissue, showed a statistically significant increase in PPARα −/− animals of both sexes compared with wild type controls. The total amount of dissected fat pads for PPARα −/− females and males represented 238 and 150% of C57BL/6 mice, respectively (Table I), thus confirming that a size increase of fat adipose tissue accounts for the higher body weight recorded in knockouts compared with controls. Also, in accordance with the sexual dimorphism of weight gain, substantially greater fat deposits were observed in deficient females compared with males.Table IPPARα null mutants at 240 days have increased adipose tissue mass and mutant males have increased hepatic indexLiver weightInguinal WAT weightReproductive WAT weightInterscapular WAT weightRetroperitoneal WAT weightInterscapular BAT weightTotal WAT weight% body weightMale Wild type4.04 ± 0.120.98 ± 0.142.79 ± 0.240.37 ± 0.060.90 ± 0.120.35 ± 0.025.05 ± 0.44 PPARα-deficient5.08 ± 0.221.99 ± 0.253.67 ± 0.270.73 ± 0.101.19 ± 0.270.51 ± 0.077.58 ± 0.63 Percentage of wild type125.8% (p = 0.0005)203.0% (p = 0.0024)131.6% (p = 0.0247)194.1% (p = 0.0093)131.3% (p = 0.2012)143.7% (p = 0.046)150.1% (p = 0.042)Female Wild type4.47 ± 0.121.03 ± 0.212.39 ± 0.260.40 ± 0.040.40 ± 0.050.25 ± 0.034.24 ± 0.45 PPARα-deficient4.62 ± 0.162.49 ± 0.385.83 ± 0.750.93 ± 0.120.71 ± 0.100.45 ± 0.0910.09 ± 1.26 Percentage of wild type103.3% (p = 0.4673)240.9% (p = 0.0036)243.9% (p = 0.0004)229.1% (p = 0.0006)177.1% (p = 0.0035)179.1% (p = 0.0528)238% (p = 0.0004)Liver and discrete fat pads from five anatomical sites were dissected and weighed.

Statistical relevance of data is assessed by p values. Necropsy analyses revealed striking hepatic abnormalities exclusively in deficient males. All PPARα −/− males displayed a considerable hepatic enlargement, which was associated with a pale steatotic color (Fig. 2 B). Detailed examination of the organ surface revealed a regular pattern of clearer dots expressed on all lobes (not shown). Liver weight analyses (Table I) showed a male-specific hepatomegaly. The liver weight from PPARα −/− males represented 125% of wild type organs, while no difference was noted when comparing livers from females. This spontaneously occurring abnormality, observed in all deficient male individuals, arose with a strong statistical significance (p = 0.0005, n = 10). The correlation between liver morphological changes and hepatomegaly in deficient males was strongly evocative of hepatic steatosis. To substantiate this hypothesis, a separate study was designed. PPARα −/− and control mice of both sexes, kept under the same standard diet conditions, were euthanized at 44, 116 (data not shown), 166, and 302 days to evaluate the kinetics of a putative lipid accumulation in the liver (Fig. 3). Histological analyses revealed a unique pattern of accumulation of intracellular fat droplets, clearly restricted to the centrilobular area of deficient male livers. At 44 days, no abnormality was detected. Numerous lipid microvesicules were seen already at 110 days in the cytoplasm of mono- and polynucleated parenchymal cells (Fig. 3 L). The extent of lipid storage and the size of the fat droplets increased progressively with time. At 302 days, normal hepatocytes were restricted to periportal zones, while wide centrilobular areas evoked adipose tissue, indicating a cellular heterogeneity of the liver toward fat storage capability. This heterogeneity is highlighted by the lipid-specific oil red-O-positive staining of frozen liver sections of 302-day-old deficient males (Fig. 3 L). Preliminary studies conducted with 8–10-week-old males of both genotypes showed steady levels of serum triglycerides, while an increase of the cholesterol level in the deficient mice was noted (data not shown), in accordance with a previous report (31Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). When performed at 240 days, the analysis revealed increased levels of circulating triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids in PPARα −/− mice compared with controls (Fig. 4). Deficient females exhibited a markedly high level of triglycerides, 250.5% of control values. By quantifying lipoproteins in these samples, we observed similar values for VLDL, LDL, and high density lipoproteins between deficient or wild type males or females with a single exception; the VLDL value in PPARα −/− females was 246% of wild type. When expressed as the ratio VLDL/LDL, deficient females show 291% of the wild type value (Fig. 4). Considering the high contribution of triglycerides in the composition of VLDL, triglycerides and VLDL values in deficient females are very corroborative data that suggest a VLDL increase as the primary cause for total triglyceride increase. Additional blood parameters such as transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and urea were not different from C57BL/6 in PPARα −/− mice (data not shown). Lipids were quantified from frozen fragments of the liver large lobe. The results accurately correlate with histological and serological studies. Steatotic PPARα −/− male livers exhibit 10-fold more cholesteryl esters and 9.5-fold more triglycerides than controls. In deficient females, who presented the highest circulating levels in triglycerides but the mildest hepatic repercussions, these ratios were only 3.3- and 2.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 5).Figure 5Lipid content analysis of li"

We accounted for oxygen consumption quantitatively from the rates of substrate oxidation, measured on a minute-to-minute basis. Total β-oxidation (but not exogenous oleate oxidation) was increased by the work jump, consistent with a decrease in the level of malonyl-CoA. Glycogen and lactate were important buffers for carbon substrate when heart work was acutely increased. Three mechanisms contributed to high respiration from glycogen: 1) carbohydrate oxidation was increased selectively; 2) stimulation of glucose oxidation was delayed at glucose uptake; and 3) glycogen-derived pyruvate behaved differently from pyruvate derived from extracellular glucose. Despite delayed activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase relative to phosphorylase, glycogen-derived pyruvate was more tightly coupled to oxidation. Also, glycogen-derived lactate plus pyruvate contributed to an increase in the relative efflux of lactate versuspyruvate, thereby regulating the redox. Glycogen synthesis resulted from activation of glycogen synthase late in the protocol but was timed to minimize futile cycling, since phosphorylase a became inhibited by high intracellular glucose.

Increased heart work, usually elicited by catecholamines, increases carbohydrate oxidation because of activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)1by dephosphorylation (1Hiraoka T. DeBuysere M. Olson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7604-7609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); PDC phosphatase is stimulated by increased mitochondrial Ca2+ (2McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Activation of PDC under conditions of high workload could be advantageous, tending to increase carbohydrate oxidation selectively. Under the assumption that the ATP yield per O2 consumed is higher for oxidation of carbohydrate versus lipid, a selective increase in carbohydrate oxidation could provide increased ATP synthesis despite maximum oxygen extraction. Whether increased substrate oxidation with workload is selective for carbohydrate remains unresolved. Studies by us (3Goodwin G.W. Ahmad F. Doenst T. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1239-H1247PubMed Google Scholar) and by Collins-Nakai et al. (4Collins-Nakai R.L. Noseworthy D. Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1862-H1871PubMed Google Scholar), using isolated working rat hearts, indicated that increased substrate oxidation is selective for carbohydrate, with little or no increase in exogenous fatty acid oxidation. In contrast, early studies by Neely et al. (5Neely J.R. Bowman R.H. Morgan H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 216: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Neely J.R. Whitmer K.M. Mochizuki S. Circ. Res. 1976; 38 (suppl. 1): I22-I30Google Scholar) and Crass et al. (7Crass M.F., III McCaskill E.S. Shipp J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 216: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggested that fatty acid and carbohydrate oxidation increase in parallel. Hall et al. (8Hall J.L. Lopaschuk G.D. Barr A. Bringas J. Pizzorro R.D. Stanley W.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 879-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that swine heart exhibit increased fatty acid uptake in vivo in response to dobutamine, presumably from stimulated β-oxidation, since levels of malonyl-CoA were reduced. Increased systemic nonesterified fatty acids resulting from peripheral lipolysis could also have promoted fatty acid uptake in that study. Awan and Saggerson (9Awan M.M. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) found reduced malonyl-CoA in isolated hearts and stimulated palmitate oxidation by isolated (nonworking) heart myocytes upon adrenergic stimulation. Therefore, the potential exists for direct adrenergic stimulation of total β-oxidation in the heart resulting from lowered malonyl-CoA, which is a potent inhibitor of a limiting enzyme for β-oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. The problem with existing studies is the failure to consider all relevant exogenous and endogenous substrates. The question of whether carbohydrate oxidation is increased selectively with the workload cannot be answered based on measures of glucose and exogenous fatty acid oxidation alone. Regulation of total β-oxidation should, ideally, consider both exogenous and endogenous lipids. Therefore, we extended existing studies in the following important ways. We examined oxidation of all carbohydrates (glucose, glycogen, and lactate) that together contribute virtually all PDC flux. We also considered total β-oxidation of exogenous and endogenous lipids. We used a pulse-chase technique to measure glycogen turnover continuously. Using this method, we find that the degree of coupling of glycogen utilization to oxidation varies depending on the relation between glycogenolysis and the capacity for carbohydrate oxidation (i.e. phosphorylase activation versus PDC activation). To explain the tight coupling of glycogen to subsequent oxidation, we examined the hypothesis that the burst of glycogenolysis is coordinated with activation of PDC. Surprisingly, it was not. Lactate and pyruvate are released or consumed by tissues at different rates, since their systemic concentrations differ. We hypothesize that heart, which, at times, displays large fluxes for lactate or pyruvate across the plasma membrane, uses differential efflux of lactateversus pyruvate (a redox pair) as a supplemental mechanism for regulation of the cytosolic redox. We previously found small amounts of simultaneous glycogen synthesis and degradation in heart, especially during glycogen depletion (10Goodwin G.W. Arteaga J.A. Taegtmeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9234-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Compared with total glycolytic flux, the contribution of flux through glycogen in the absence of cyclical changes in glycogen content (“glycogen cycling” (11Villar-Palasi C. Larner J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1960; 86: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) was minor. In the present study, we examined activities for synthase and phosphorylase and their allosteric effectors in relation to fluxes for glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis. We postulate that the well described reciprocal regulation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase, apparently designed to prevent futile cycling of glycogen, is robust, preventing more than minor glycogen cycling in heart. Isotopes were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim. Other chemicals were from Sigma. Fatty acid synthase was purified from rat liver after inducing the enzyme; rats were fasted for 2 days and then fed bread (8% protein, no fat) for 3 days. Enzyme was purified from the cytosol of four rat livers (53 g) as described by Awan and Saggerson (9Awan M.M. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) except that chromatography was on DEAE-cellulose, as described by Linn (12Linn T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We obtained 68 units (1.1 unit/mg of protein), assayed by the method of Carey and Dils (13Carey E.M. Dils R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 210: 371-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hearts from chow-fed male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (349 ± 8 g, n = 25) were perfused using the working heart apparatus (14Taegtmeyer H. Hems R. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) in a gas-tight configuration described previously (10Goodwin G.W. Arteaga J.A. Taegtmeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9234-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The filling pressure was 15 cm H2O, and the afterload/perfusion pressure was initially 100 cm H2O, increased to 140 cm H2O at the time of adrenergic stimulation. The initial perfusate was Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1.4 mm free Ca2+ (1.5 mm CaCl2 plus 0.1 mm EDTA), equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Hearts were perfused in the working mode using 200 ml of recirculated perfusate, lacking carbon substrate initially. The initial part of this protocol (Fig. 1) was designed to deplete and then resynthesize glycogen, as we previously described (3Goodwin G.W. Ahmad F. Doenst T. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1239-H1247PubMed Google Scholar). After 20 min, the perfusate was supplemented to 5 mm glucose, 40 microunits/ml regular insulin (Lilly), 5 mm sodium d-β-hydroxybutyrate, and 0.5 mm sodium l-lactate, and perfusion was continued for 25 min to allow glycogen resynthesis while contractile function returned to base line. Hearts were then switched to a nonrecirculating mode as described previously (3Goodwin G.W. Ahmad F. Doenst T. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1239-H1247PubMed Google Scholar). The perfusate during this period was Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 5 mmglucose, 40 microunits/ml insulin, 0.5 mm sodiuml-lactate, 0.4 mm sodium oleate prebound to 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V, fatty acid free, Intergen, Purchase, NY), with 1.4 mm free Ca2+ (the preparation was dialyzed against a large volume of albumin-free perfusate containing 1.5 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mm EDTA). At 55 min, epinephrine bitartrate was added to 1 μm, and the height of the aortic overflow was raised to 140 cm above the heart. Hearts were freeze-clamped on their cannulae with aluminum tongs cooled in liquid N2. We studied three treatment groups according to the time at which hearts were freeze-clamped: “unstimulated” (n = 5, clamped at 55 min of the protocol), “acute stimulation” (n= 5, clamped at 58 min at the peak of glycogen oxidation, Fig. 3), and “prolonged stimulation” (n = 15, clamped at 75 min). Hearts subjected to prolonged stimulation were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups according to which14C-labeled isotope was traced: exogenous [U-14C]glucose (n = 5, 20 μCi/liter, 4 μCi/mmol), exogenous [U-14C]lactate (n= 5, 3 μCi/liter, 6 μCi/mmol), or 14C-glycogen (n = 5, 100 μCi/liter, 20 μCi/mmol [U-14C]glucose included between 20 and 45 min of the protocol). In some perfusions, we included [9,10-3H]oleate (30 μCi/liter, 75 μCi/mmol) to measure fatty acid oxidation and de novo triglyceride synthesis. A portion of the coronary flow (10 ml/min) was pumped through a stirred, thermostated 3-ml chamber fitted with a Clark electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.) and then returned to the heart chamber. A second electrode was fitted to the bottom of the oxygenator, and the two electrode currents were displayed continuously. MVO2 was calculated from the A −V difference times the coronary flow, using 1.06 mm for the concentration of dissolved O2 at 100% saturation (15Starnes J.W. Wilson D.F. Ereciňska M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: H799-H806PubMed Google Scholar). Electrodes were calibrated with air-saturated water (19.6% O2 saturation after correction for water vapor, 47 mm Hg at 37 °C). Hydraulic power (watts) is the product of cardiac output (coronary plus aortic flow, m3/s) times the afterload (pascals). Aortic pressure was recorded continuously with a Millar pressure transducer (Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) at the side arm of the aortic cannula, interfaced to a Gould physiologic recorder (Gould model 2400S; Cleveland, OH). 14CO2 and3H2O were determined in fresh perfusate as described previously (3Goodwin G.W. Ahmad F. Doenst T. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1239-H1247PubMed Google Scholar). We verified that14CO2 is recovered quantitatively by injecting 2 μCi of [14C]NaHCO3 into the apparatus. The sum of 14C-lactate plus 14C-pyruvate was determined in deproteinized perfusate by paper chromatography (16Goodwin G.W. Ahmad F. Taegtmeyer H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Lactate and pyruvate migrate together in this system. The recovery of lactate from perfusate spiked with authentic [U-14C]lactate was 88 ± 2% (n = 5) and was completely separated from [U-14C]glucose. Other metabolites (lactate, pyruvate, glucose, glycerol) were measured in deproteinized samples by established spectrophotometric enzymatic assays (17Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974Google Scholar). Metabolic rates were calculated as described previously (3Goodwin G.W. Ahmad F. Doenst T. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1239-H1247PubMed Google Scholar). Apparent rates from glycogen were calculated based on the specific activity of glucose used to prelabel glycogen and then converted to true rates by assuming uniform isotopic enrichment of 54.7% (unstimulated treatment group in Table I).Table IGlycogen content and enrichmentTreatment group[Total glycogen][[14C]Glycogen] (enrichment)μmol/g, dry wtUnstimulated (n = 5)107 ± 659 ± 10 (55 ± 10%)Acute stimulation (n = 5)80 ± 2ND1-aNot determined.Prolonged stimulation (n = 15)55 ± 5NA1-bNot applicable.

Frozen hearts were weighed and ground to a fine powder under liquid N2, and a portion was taken for dry weight determination. High energy phosphates (ATP, ADP, AMP, glucose 6-phosphate, phosphocreatine), Pi, pyruvate, and malonyl-CoA were measured in freshly prepared 6% perchloric acid extracts, adjusted to pH 5 with buffered KOH. High energy phosphates and pyruvate were measured using established enzymatic assays (17Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974Google Scholar). Inorganic phosphate was measured with the acid molybdate reaction (18Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA was measured radiochemically with purified fatty acid synthase (19McGarry J.D. Stark M.J. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8291-8293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of triglycerides, a total lipid extract was prepared (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar), and the triglyceride fraction was isolated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates (Whatman No. 4860-320) using CHCl3 as the mobile phase. Lipid in the triglyceride band (R F = 0.5) was extracted from the silica (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar), hydrolyzed with alcoholic KOH, neutralized with perchloric acid, and analyzed for glycerol (17Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974Google Scholar). Values were referred to acyl content (glycerol/3). This procedure had a recovery of 80%, using tripalmitin as an internal standard. To determine de novo synthesis, a portion of the neutralized hydrolysate was taken for scintillation counting, and the radioactivity referred to new acyl group incorporation based on the specific activity of extracellular [9,10-3H]oleate. Glycogen was measured as described previously (3Goodwin G.W. Ahmad F. Doenst T. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1239-H1247PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated glycogen was free from contamination by glucose and extracellular isotopes. To measure the tissue distribution of 14C in glycogen, heart powder (50 mg) was dispersed into 1 ml of glacial acetic acid and then evaporated to dryness to remove14CO2. The residue was dissolved by heating with 1 ml of SolvableTM (Packard Instrument Co.) and then counted after adding 10 ml of scintillation mixture (Ultima Gold; Packard). In hearts subjected to 14C-pulse labeling (i.e. 14C-glycogen and unstimulated treatment groups), 85 ± 3 and 90 ± 3% of 14C was found in glycogen, respectively. This indicates that glycogen recovery from the isolation procedure is at least 90% (otherwise there would be more14C-glycogen than total radioactivity) and that glycogen was virtually the sole source of radioactivity during the chase. Glycogen synthase was measured as described by Skurat et al. (21Skurat A.V. Lim S-S. Roach P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using the filter binding assay of Thomas et al. (22Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The glycogen phosphorylase assay was based on the method of Gilboe et al. (23Gilboe D.P. Larson K.L. Nuttall F.Q. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We determined the enzyme in the reverse direction by release of Pi measured with the acid molybdate reaction (18Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Phosphorylase a was measured in the presence of 0.5 mm caffeine to prevent activation by endogenous AMP (24Hue L. Bontemps F. Hers H-G. Biochem. J. 1975; 152: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and total phosphorylase was measured in the presence of 3 mm AMP. Pyruvate dehydrogenase was measured by 14CO2 production from 2 mm [1-14C]pyruvate, as described by Harriset al. (25Harris R.A. Yamanouchi K. Roach P.J. Yen T.T. Dominianni S.J. Stephens T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14674-14680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active form was measured directly, and the total activity was measured following incubation for 30 min at 30 °C with 1 mm CaCl2 plus 5 mmMgCl2, to allow dephosphorylation by endogenous PDC phosphatase. This procedure produced stable, maximal values for the total activity of PDC. We established that all of the enzyme assays were linear with respect to time and amount of tissue extract used in the assays. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparison was by analysis of variance with post hoc comparison by Newman-Keuls multisample test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. We performed five sets of matched perfusions, three of which were used to measure oxidation of three different 14C-labeled substrates (14CO2 from glucose, glycogen, or lactate). Physiologic performance of these three groups is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 A shows contractile activity (hydraulic power, watts), and the bottom panel shows oxygen consumption (MVO2). Two other treatment groups (unstimulated, and acute stimulation) were omitted from the figure for clarity, because the data points overlapped the values presented. These two groups were freeze-clamped at earlier times of the protocol, for tissue analysis. Various measures of performance for all the groups are given in the Appendix . The five groups were well matched for all values of performance measured. Performance is comparable with values measured in vivo for resting and exercising rats (26Flaim S.F. Minteer W.J. Zelis R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1979; 46: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). During the first 20 min of the protocol (Fig. 1), the absence of exogenous substrates resulted in diminishing contractile function. The protocol was designed to deplete endogenous substrates, evidenced by continued oxygen consumption. The addition of substrates at 20 min (glucose plus insulin, lactate, and d-β-hydroxybutyrate) restored performance (Fig. 2). We usedd-β-hydroxybutyrate as a co-substrate to maintain incorporation of glucose into glycogen. Perfusions were switched to a nonrecirculating mode starting at 45 min (beginning of the “chase” for glycogen labeling), and the only change in substrate availability at that time was the replacement of β-hydroxybutyrate for a physiologic long-chain fatty acid, oleate prebound to albumin. Following a 10-min equilibration period, hearts were stimulated with epinephrine (1 μm), and at the same time, we raised the afterload by 40%. There was an immediate 95% increase in contractile performance and 103% increase in MVO2. As occurs in vivo, oxygen extraction was slightly increased by this intervention, and O2 was almost completely extracted, but most of the increase in MVO2 resulted from an increase in coronary flow (see Appendix). Immediately after the work jump, there was no change in the supply/demand ratio for oxygen (MVO2/power), suggesting that hearts did not experience acute demand ischemia (this issue is examined further below). There was a 14% reduction in the ratio MVO2/power after prolonged stimulation, consistent with the well known reduction in cardiac efficiency during adrenergic stimulation. Fig. 3 shows rates of substrate oxidation during the chase period for glycogen. Rates were measured by the Fick principle (V − A difference times coronary flow, but the A side was fresh perfusate or endogenous substrate), based on 14CO2 production for carbohydrate oxidation, or 3H2O production from exogenous [9,10-3H]oleate. The results are similar to those we reported previously (3Goodwin G.W. Ahmad F. Doenst T. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1239-H1247PubMed Google Scholar), determined in the absence of insulin and lactate and without increasing the perfusion pressure. The new finding is that, like glycogen, lactate oxidation is rapidly increased, but unlike glycogen, increased lactate oxidation is sustained. Table I gives values for the content of total glycogen, 14C-glycogen, and enrichment. In hearts clamped at 55 min (unstimulated), the glycogen enrichment achieved by the labeling protocol (pulse portion of the pulse-chase) was 55 ± 10%. With acute adrenergic stimulation, the decrease in glycogen content was not large, since the duration of stimulation was short (3 min). Following prolonged stimulation, the total glycogen content decreased by half, as did the content for 14C-glycogen. The enrichment of residual glycogen remained the same (49 ± 9%,14C-glycogen group in Table I). A similar value for enrichment (49%) was calculated for the glycogen that was broken down, correcting for the small amount of de novo synthesis ([14C]glucose group in Table I). These findings indicate that glycogen was degraded randomly, without discretion for new [14C]glycosyl residues and preexisting [12C]glycogen. As expected, there was no glycogen synthesis from lactate (Table I, last line). We next considered the possibility that the initial glycogen degraded was enriched to a greater extent than the rest (i.e. a hybrid of random and ordered degradation). The distinction (purely random versus hybrid model) is important for interpretation of the present data, as well as data from 13C NMR spectroscopy studies. To do this, we examined the time course of glycogen enrichment by taking advantage of oxygen consumption measurements, but it was first necessary to account for oxygen consumption from all the substrates. Total triglyceride content of the hearts increased slightly (not significantly) during the 20 min of adrenergic stimulation (from 56.9 ± 6.2 (n = 5) to 59.3 ± 6.3 (n = 15) μmol of acyl/g, dry weight for unstimulated and prolonged stimulation treatment groups, respectively). During the same interval, de novo synthesis, based on incorporation of [9,10-3H]oleate into triglycerides, increased (p < 0.05) from 1.38 ± 0.34 (n = 3) to 6.38 ± 1.40 (n = 15) μmol of acyl/g, dry weight. Therefore, the total triglyceride pool size expanded by 2.4 μmol acyl/g, dry weight, and de novo synthesis was 5.0 μmol of acyl/g, dry weight. Using the relation degradation = synthesis − change in pool size, the value for degradation is 5.0–2.4 = 2.6 μmol/g, dry weight, and the corresponding rate over 20 min is 0.13 μmol/min/g, dry weight (8% of exogenous oleate oxidation). To calculate oxygen consumption, we assumed that triglycerides were oxidized using a value of 25.5 mol of O2/mol for the average acyl group (i.e. like oleate). Release of pyruvate contributes slightly to oxygen consumption (0.5 mol of O2/mol of pyruvate release) because pyruvate is more oxidized than its precursors (glucose, glycogen, or lactate). Rates of pyruvate release are given in Appendix Table IIA.Table IIGlycogen synthase activity and the content of glucose 6-phosphateTreatment groupActivity state[Glucose 6-phosphate]%μmol/g, dry wtUnstimulated (n = 5)12.7 ± 2.01.90 ± 0.16Acute stimulation (n = 5)9.1 ± 2.22.19 ± 0.25Prolonged stimulation (n = 15)21.0 ± 1.12-ap < 0.05 versusunstimulated.1.61 ± 0.09Values are the mean ± S.E.

Glycogen synthaseD did not differ between the different groups and was 6.9 ± 0.2 μmol/min/g, dry weight (n = 25). Fig. 4 shows predicted and measured rates of oxygen consumption. Predicted rates are based on the sum for the measured rates of oxidation of every major substrate (glucose, glycogen, lactate, oleate, triglycerides, and release of pyruvate). To calculate rates of oxygen consumption resulting from glycogen oxidation, we assumed that there is uniform isotopic dilution (i.e. that a purely random pattern of synthesis and degradation applies) and used the values given in Fig. 3. Two conclusions can be drawn from the close agreement between measured and predicted MVO2. First, we accounted for every major oxidizable substrate for the heart quantitatively. Second, the assumption of uniform isotopic dilution is valid. The second conclusion is shown more clearly in Fig. 5, which depicts oxygen consumption resulting from glycogen oxidation over time. The upper curve is oxygen consumption from oxidation of all glycogen, based on the difference between MVO2 and oxygen consumption from every substrate except glycogen. The lower curve is oxygen consumption from oxidation of that portion of glycogen (55% of the total) that was labeled with 14C (i.e. the apparent rate of glycogen oxidation × 6). The relationship between the two curves is precisely the pattern expected based on purely random synthesis and/or degradation. It is distinguished from the pattern expected based on the last on-first off model or from a hybrid model.Figure 5Oxygen consumption resulting from total glycogen oxidation compared with [14C]glycogen oxidation.

In this study, we demonstrate that SPARC inhibits DNA synthesis by >90% in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) stimulated by the endothelial cell mitogen vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Peptides derived from SPARC domain IV, which contains a disulfide-bonded EF-hand sequence and binds to endothelial cells, mimicked the effect of native SPARC. The inhibition was also observed with a peptide from the follistatin-like domain II, whereas peptides from SPARC domains I and III had no effect on VEGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. The inhibition of HMEC proliferation was mediated in part by the binding of VEGF to SPARC. The binding of125I-VEGF to HMEC was reduced by SPARC and SPARC peptides from domain IV in a concentration-dependent manner. In a radioimmune precipitation assay, peptides from SPARC domains II and IV each competed with native SPARC for its binding to VEGF. It has been reported that VEGF stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2. We now show that SPARC reduces this phosphorylation in VEGF-stimulated HMEC to levels of unstimulated controls. SPARC thus modulates the mitogenic activity of VEGF through a direct binding interaction and reduces the association of VEGF with its cell-surface receptors. Moreover, an additional diminution of VEGF activity by SPARC is accomplished through a reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases.

Angiogenesis, the sprouting of new capillaries from established vasculature, occurs in many physiological and pathological processes (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7152) Google Scholar, 2Battegay E.J. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and involves several distinct steps that include proteolysis of the extracellular matrix (ECM),1 cell migration, proliferation, and changes in capillary permeability (3Sage E.H. Adv. Oncol. 1996; 12: 17-29Google Scholar). Modulation of cell adhesion and ECM is influenced by SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine; also known as BM-40 and osteonectin) and thrombospondin 1, both of which promote counteradhesion and exhibit increased levels in remodeling tissues (see Ref. 4Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, and references therein). These proteins belong to a small group of secreted matricellular components that mediate cell-matrix interactions and thus do not serve primarily structural roles (4Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). SPARC inhibits cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase (5Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2648-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Studies on human fibroblasts have shown that SPARC regulates cellular proliferation through an interaction with PDGF-AB and -BB and a subsequent inhibition of binding to cognate cell-surface receptors (6Raines E.W. Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.-L. Ross R. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). SPARC also reduces the proliferative and migratory effects of bFGF on endothelial cells. A direct interaction between bFGF and SPARC, however, has not been established (7Hasselaar P. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). VEGF is an endothelial cell mitogen that also increases vascular permeability (8Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar). There are five different human VEGF isoforms, consisting of monomers of 121, 145, 165, 189, and 206 amino acids, that are derived from a single gene by alternative splicing (9Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L. Leung D.W. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar, 10Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky L. Keshet E Neufeld G. J. Biol.

Each monomer is capable of forming an active homodimer that is secreted either exclusively into the culture medium (VEGF121), localized at the cell surface, and/or associated with the ECM, possibly as a result of differential binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. VEGF exhibits a 20% similarity in amino acid sequence to PDGF A and B chains and a 53% similarity to placenta growth factor (12Thomas K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The class III receptor tyrosine kinases Flt-1 and KDR/Flk-1 interact specifically with VEGF (13Neufeld G. Tessler S. Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Levi B.-Z. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). An essential role for Flk-1 in embryonic vasculogenesis has been established, since flk −/− mice exhibited significantly reduced formation of blood islands and died in utero. In contrast, mice lacking the Flt-1 receptor did form blood islands, but the morphogenesis of the vasculature was impaired (14Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L.

A major stimulus for VEGF/VEGF receptor expression in adult tissue is hypoxia, a condition resulting from ischemia (16Aiello L.P. Avery R.L. Arrigg P.G. Keyt B.A. Jampel H.D. Shah S.T. Pasquale L.R.

Invest. 1995; 72: 638-645PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that VEGF could regulate angiogenesis-dependent tumor growth (18Melnyk O. Shuman M.A. Kim K.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 921-924PubMed Google Scholar), in part through induction of integrin receptors that recognize one or more collagen types. We have proposed that SPARC modulates, directly or indirectly, the effects of growth factors and ECM on cell behavior (3Sage E.H. Adv. Oncol. 1996; 12: 17-29Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that SPARC interferes with VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation. Since pericytes and endothelial cells respond to PDGF and VEGF, respectively, SPARC appears to be a significant factor in the regulation of vascular growth. SPARC was purified from the culture medium of murine parietal yolk sac carcinoma cells (19Sage E.H. Vernon R. Funk S. Everitt E. Angello J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar); SPARC peptides were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (20Lane T.F. Sage E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3065-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Concentrations in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, were determined by absorbance at 280 nm (extinction coefficient for a 1 mm solution at 280 nm is 0.82 for SPARC and 7.21 for peptides 4.2 and 4.0). Concentrations for peptides 2.1 and 3.4 were calculated by weight only. Low passage (5Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Collins, CO), 50 μg/ml endothelial growth supplement (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA), 20 μg/ml heparin, and 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma). Confluent HMEC were growth-arrested by incubation in MCDB 131, devoid of serum and growth supplement, for 24 h. Cells were replated in fully supplemented MCDB 131 at a density of 25,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate. Within 2 h, 90% of the cells were attached. The medium was replaced with MCDB 131 containing heparin and glutamine only. SPARC, SPARC peptides and/or VEGF165 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was added for 20 h, and 1 μCi/ml (3.7 × 104 Bq/ml) [3H]thymidine was present during the last 4 h. Material precipitated in trichloroacetic acid was hydrolyzed in 0.2 m NaOH and was subsequently dissolved in 3 ml of Ecolume (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for scintillation counting (5Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2648-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). VEGF and fibronectin were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% milk/0.05% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad), and incubated for 3 h at room temperature with 125I-SPARC (1 pm), in the presence or absence of a 250-fold molar excess of unlabeled SPARC. Proteins that bound 125I-SPARC were visualized by autoradiography (6Raines E.W. Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.-L. Ross R. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). 125I-SPARC was incubated with VEGF as indicated and was immunoprecipitated with goat anti-human VEGF IgG (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and Protein G-Sepharose™ (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The immune complex bound to the Sepharose™ beads was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl in 150 mm NaCl, boiled in Laemmli buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205496) Google Scholar), and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels under nonreducing conditions (7Hasselaar P. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The binding of125I-VEGF to cells was performed as described for125I-PDGF binding (22Bowen-Pope D.F. Ross R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 69-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), with minor variations. Briefly, cells were grown on non-coated plastic since it was found to decrease nonspecific binding without affecting the specific binding of125I-VEGF. Confluent HMEC were incubated in serum- and growth supplement-free MCDB 131 for 24 h. Cells were rinsed once with ice-cold MCDB 131 containing 0.025 m HEPES and 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). 125I-VEGF with or without SPARC was added at the indicated concentrations and was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h on a platform shaker. The cells were washed three times with PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.25 mmCaCl2, and were incubated for 5 min in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.16% NaN3 to remove bound VEGF. The soluble content of each well was counted in a γ counter. For assessment of nonspecific binding, a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled VEGF was added per well. The counts (less than 15% of total counts) were subtracted from the total counts. Binding assays were performed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments and were analyzed according to Scatchard (23Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17745) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the dish, and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol; Complete Protease-Inhibitor Mixture™ (Boehringer Mannheim)). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C, and the cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-human Flt-1 or anti-human KDR IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The immune complex was precipitated for 2 h with Protein A-Sepharose™ beads (Pierce) and was washed five times with lysis buffer. The immunodepleted supernatant was saved and was used for the detection of α-enolase. The beads were subsequently boiled in Laemmli buffer and were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 5 s. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7% gels) under reducing conditions and were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was incubated for 1 h with 3% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. The blot was incubated with mouse anti-human phosphotyrosine IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Immunoreactivity was detected by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase and was subsequently visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 10% of the immunodepleted supernatant of each reaction mix was saved to probe for α-enolase (24Redlitz A. Fowler B.J. Plow E.F. Miles L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, and incubated with rabbit anti-human enolase IgG followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. The detection of the phosphorylated forms of Erk1 and Erk2 was performed as described above with rabbit anti-human phospho-MAPK IgG (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Immunoreactivity was detected by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. For assessment of differences in protein loading, the membrane was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min with 2-mercaptoethanol (100 mm) and SDS (2%) in Tris-HCl (62 mm, pH 6.7) (“stripping buffer”), blocked, and incubated with rabbit anti-α-enolase IgG as described above. Sagittal sections of mouse embryos (gestational day 12) were embedded in paraffin and were immersed in methyl-Carnoy's fixative (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, 10% acetic acid). Paraffin was removed by two 5-min washes each with xylene, ethanol, and PBS. Sections were incubated for 30 min in 10% rabbit serum and subsequently for 1 h with mouse monoclonal anti-human osteonectin IgG (Hematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT), rabbit polyclonal anti-human VEGF IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit preimmune serum for 1 h. After three rinses in PBS, the sections were incubated for 30 min with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG or biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunoreactivity was detected by avidin-rhodamine (Vector Laboratories) and was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Addition of VEGF to HMEC stimulated DNA synthesis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a maximal 3-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation after 4 days (data not shown). When HMEC were incubated with SPARC, they exhibited generally a less flattened morphology but remained attached and viable for a minimum of 48 h. We treated the cells for a maximum of 20 h in the presence of 0.12 nm VEGF and/or 0.6 μmSPARC, the established ED50 for inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation (5Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2648-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), in serum-free medium. VEGF stimulated an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation of 80–100%, whereas SPARC alone had no effect on DNA synthesis at a concentration of 0.6 μm (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, the change in cell shape elicited by 0.6 μm SPARC did not result in a diminution of DNA synthesis in these cells. When SPARC and VEGF were added simultaneously to the cells, no significant increase in DNA synthesis compared with the solvent control was apparent (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, simultaneous addition of SPARC and VEGF did not result in increased cell number, as measured by cell counts (data not shown). SPARC has four structurally different regions (domains I–IV) (25Engel J. Taylor W. Paulsson M. Sage H. Hogan B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6958-6965Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Lane T.F. Sage E.H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar); domains III and IV comprise an extracellular Ca2+-binding module (27Hohenester E. Maurer P. Hohenadl C. Timpl R. Jansonius J.N. Engel J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). SPARC peptides 4.2 (amino acids 254–273) and 4.0 (amino acids 248–285) are located at the C terminus, within domain IV. Increasing concentrations of peptide 4.0 alone reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation by 82% (Fig. 1 B), as noted for other endothelial cells (28Sage E.H. Bassuk J.A. Yost J.C. Folkman M.J. Lane T.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Addition of peptides 4.2 or 2.1 (amino acids 54–73) to HMEC stimulated by VEGF also inhibited cell proliferation (Fig. 1 C). Peptide 3.4 (amino acids 184–303), however, had no significant effect on VEGF-stimulated DNA synthesis (Fig. 1 C). These results demonstrate that SPARC and SPARC peptides from domains II and IV abrogated significantly the mitogenic effect of VEGF on HMEC. Similar levels of inhibition of VEGF-stimulated proliferation by SPARC were observed in human aortic endothelial cells and human iliac arterial endothelial cells (data not shown). To understand how SPARC inhibits VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, we incubated125I-SPARC with VEGF (200 ng) and fibronectin (1 μg) that had been separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Fig. 2). 125I-SPARC bound to VEGF but not to fibronectin. When the blot was incubated with125I-SPARC in the presence of a 250-fold molar excess of unlabeled SPARC, the binding of 125I-SPARC to VEGF was eliminated. Staining of the blot with Amido Black indicated that both proteins were transferred completely (not shown). 125I-SPARC and VEGF were also incubated overnight and were subsequently immunoprecipitated by a polyclonal anti-human VEGF antibody (Table I). When125I-SPARC and VEGF were incubated with excess SPARC peptides, the amount of immunoprecipitated 125I-SPARC decreased significantly in the presence of peptides 2.1, 4.2, or 4.2ND, but not 3.4. Peptide 4.2 was the most effective competitor for the binding of SPARC to VEGF (85%).Table IBinding of 125I-SPARC to VEGF is competed by specific SPARC peptidesSPARC peptide competitor125I-SPARC, % of total precipitateNo peptide100Peptide 2.163 ± 2.01-bThree independent experiments were quantified by densitometry.

Open table in a new tab 125I-SPARC (0.85 pm) was incubated with VEGF (1 nm) overnight and was immunoprecipitated by anti-VEGF IgG1 in the presence of SPARC peptides (500-fold molar excess over SPARC).

Immunoprecipitated samples that were not resolved by SDS-PAGE but were measured alternatively in a γ counter produced similar results. The interaction of SPARC and SPARC peptides from domains II and IV with VEGF is expected to result in reduced levels of VEGF available for binding to its receptors. To test this prediction, we incubated cells with increasing concentrations of125I-VEGF. At a concentration of 0.4 nm,125I-VEGF binding was maximal; half-maximal binding occurred at a concentration of 48 pm. In the presence of 0.2 mm peptide 4.2, the maximum binding of125I-VEGF was reduced by 40% (Fig. 3 A). Increasing concentrations of peptide 4.2 added in the presence of 130 pm125I-VEGF decreased the binding of VEGF to HMEC by 70% of initial binding (Fig. 3 B). Scatchard analysis indicated two types of binding sites: a low affinity site (K d = 4.2 × 10−10m, approximately 3.2 × 105 receptors/cell), and a high affinity site (K d = 2.1 × 10−11m, approximately 1.2 × 103 receptors/cell) (Fig. 3 C). The addition of peptide 4.2 led to a reduction in the number of high affinity receptors available for 125I-VEGF binding by 40%, with no appreciable change in affinity. In contrast, low affinity binding was not affected significantly by the addition of peptide 4.2. The results of 125I-VEGF binding to HMEC indicated that SPARC interfered to a large extent with the high affinity binding site of VEGF, which we speculated to be Flt-1. To investigate the effect of SPARC on the activation of VEGF receptors Flt-1 and KDR, we treated HMEC with VEGF in the presence or absence of SPARC, performed an immunoprecipitation with anti-Flt-1 IgG, and incubated the blot with anti-phosphotyrosine IgG (Fig. 4 A). HMEC that were not stimulated with VEGF did not exhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt-1, whereas cells grown in the presence of VEGF (0.12 nm) showed a marked tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt-1. In the presence of VEGF (0.12 nm) + SPARC (0.6 μm), however, tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt-1 was not detected. To account for potential differences in loading, we blotted an equal amount of total protein from the immunodepleted supernatant and incubated it with anti-enolase IgG (Fig. 4, B and D). VEGF also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR, but this modification was not altered by the presence of SPARC (Fig. 4 C). SPARC thus strongly reduced the activation of one VEGF receptor, Flt-1, but had no or minimal effect on the activation of KDR. Since the signaling pathway activated by VEGF includes the MAPKs Erk1 and Erk2 (29D'Angelo G. Struman I. Martial J. Weiner R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6374-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 30Seetharan L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether these threonine/tyrosine kinases were affected by SPARC. A time course for MAPK activation by VEGF (0.12 nm) produced a maximum of phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 after 5–10 min (data not shown). In the presence of VEGF, Erk1 and Erk2 were phosphorylated within 10 min as much as 7.5-fold relative to that of cells grown in PBS (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2). Addition of SPARC (0.6 μm) to cells stimulated with VEGF resulted in a marked inhibition (7–8-fold) of Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylation (lane 3). HMEC in growth-supplemented media exhibited phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 at presumably maximal levels (lane 4). Incubation of the blot with anti-α-enolase IgG demonstrated equal loading of the samples (Fig. 5 B). We investigated the expression of SPARC and VEGF in developing mouse embryos. Fig. 6 A shows SPARC in the neuroepithelial layer of the embryonic day 12 telencephalon; a similar distribution was noted for VEGF (Fig. 6 B). Nonspecific staining of sections incubated with preimmune serum was essentially absent (not shown). In adult tissue, endothelial cells from the microvasculature participate in angiogenesis during wound healing, a process during which both SPARC and VEGF are expressed (31Reed M.J. Puolakkainen P. Lane T.F. Dickerson D. Bornstein P. Sage E.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1467-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 32Brown L.F. Yeo K.T. Berse B. Yeo T.K. Senger D.R. Dvorak H.F. Van De Water L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence that SPARC modulates the mitogenic activity of VEGF. Specifically, the mitogenic effect of VEGF on HMEC was abrogated in the presence of SPARC or peptides from different domains of SPARC. Previous work has established that SPARC counteracts the proliferative effect of PDGF-BB and -AB (6Raines E.W. Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.-L. Ross R. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) on human fibroblasts by a direct binding to these mitogens. Moreover, both chemotaxis and proliferation mediated by bFGF in endothelial cells are inhibited by SPARC (7Hasselaar P. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Another matricellular protein, thrombospondin 1, reduced bFGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation within a concentration range similar to that of SPARC used in the experiments reported here (33Panetti T.S. Chen H. Misenheimer T.H. Getzler S.B. Mosher D.M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1997; 129: 208-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The concentrations of SPARC and SPARC peptides that produced 50–90% inhibition of proliferation (0.6 μm for SPARC and 200 μm for the 20-amino acid SPARC peptides; Fig. 1) are completely consonant with previously published reports, in which SPARC was shown to modulate cell cycle progression (5Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2648-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), inhibit binding of PDGF-AB and -BB to its receptors (6Raines E.W. Lane T.F.

A. 1994; 91: 3448-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Disparities between concentrations of peptides and protein that are necessary to effect biological results in vitro are reported frequently and are most likely due to differences in the loss or destabilization of tertiary structure that is commonly seen in sequences of <20–40 amino acids (see Ref. 20Lane T.F. Sage E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3065-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, and references therein). Previous reports have shown inhibition of the mitogenic activity of VEGF by anti-angiogenic factors such as the 16-kDa fragment of prolactin (29D'Angelo G. Struman I. Martial J. Weiner R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6374-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and the chemokine platelet factor-4 (PF-4) (35Gengrinovitch S. Greenberg S.M. Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H.

https://openalex.org/W2071649496,"Mammalian cells typically contain hundreds of peroxisomes but can increase peroxisome abundance further in response to extracellular stimuli. We report here the identification and characterization of two novel human peroxisomal membrane proteins, PEX11alpha and PEX11beta. Overexpression of the human PEX11beta gene alone was sufficient to induce peroxisome proliferation, demonstrating that proliferation can occur in the absence of extracellular stimuli and may be mediated by a single gene. Time course studies indicated that PEX11beta induces peroxisome proliferation through a multistep process involving peroxisome elongation and segregation of PEX11beta from other peroxisomal membrane proteins, followed by peroxisome division. Overexpression of PEX11alpha also induced peroxisome proliferation but at a much lower frequency than PEX11beta in our experimental system. The patterns of PEX11alpha and PEX11beta expression were examined in the rat, the animal in which peroxisome proliferation has been examined most extensively. Levels of PEX11beta mRNA were similar in all tissues examined and were unaffected by peroxisome-proliferating agents. Conversely, PEX11alpha mRNA levels varied widely among different tissues, were highest in tissues that are sensitive to peroxisome-proliferating agents, and were induced more than 10-fold in response to the peroxisome proliferators clofibrate and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. Taken together, these data implicate PEX11beta in the constitutive control of peroxisome abundance and suggest that PEX11alpha may regulate peroxisome abundance in response to extracellular stimuli."

We initially cloned mortalins mot-1 and mot-2, which code for pancytosolically and perinuclearly distributed members of the hsp70 family of proteins, from normal and immortal murine cells, respectively (13Wadhwa R.

RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies on mortalin in normal murine tissues showed a higher level of expression in nondividing cell populations than in dividing cells. However, tumor tissues were seen to have a high intensity of mortalin staining by an antibody that reacts with both the mot-1 and mot-2 proteins (17Kaul S.C. Matsui M. Takano S. Sugihara T. Mitsui Y.

Mortalin was also identified as PBP-74, mtHSP70, and Grp75 and has been assigned roles in antigen processing, in vivo nephrotoxicity, and radioresistance in independent studies from other groups (19Kaul S.C.

In the present study, we demonstrate functional interactions of mot-2 protein with wild-type p53. Colocalization of wild-type p53 and mortalin protein was observed in transformed (nonpancytosolic mortalin) but not in normal (pancytosolic mortalin) cell types. The transcriptional activation function of p53 was impaired by transfections of mot-2 but not mot-1. Consistently, transfections of mot-2, but not those of mot-1, resulted in the down-regulation of p53-responsive genes p21WAF-1 and mdm-2. Furthermore, G1-associated nuclear translocation of p53 was abrogated by mot-2 but not by mot-1. These results demonstrated that mot-2 protein inactivates wild-type p53 function.

Three-dimensional images with enhanced fluorescence were obtained using laser digital imaging microscopy with a ×40 Plan-NEOFLUAR objective on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a CELLscan system (Scanalytics, Billerica, MA; Ref. 22Fay F.S.

The extent to which the two proteins were similarly distributed was assessed by combining the two images using computer graphics software. The individual mortalin and p53 images were seen as red and green fluorescence, respectively, and the colocalized proteins appeared yellow under this program. Transient and stable transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). Typically, 3 μg of plasmid DNA were used per 6-cm dish. All assays were performed after 48 h of transfections. Stable clones of NIH 3T3 cells with temperature-sensitive p53 expression were isolated by cotransfections of pMSVp53Val135 (a kind gift from Dr. Paul Jackson; Ref. 23Reed M. Wang Y. Mayr G.

Nonidet P-40 lysates (500 μg) from NIH 3T3 and NIH 3T3/p53.4 cells were precleared by incubating with 40 μl of protein A-agarose for 2 h. The supernatant was incubated with slow agitation overnight at 4 °C with 2–5 μg of control (isotype-matched IgG) or anti-p53 antibody (PAb421) that was cross-linked to protein A-agarose beads with dimethylpimelimidate as described previously (24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 521-523Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by semidry transfer. The membrane was probed with an anti-mortalin antibody raised against a peptide (amino acids 469–487; Ref. 13Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Ikawa Y. Sugimoto Y. J. Biol.

Cotransfections of pRL-CMV were performed as an internal control to determine the efficiency of transfections. 48 h after transfection, luciferase assays (Dual-LuciferaseTMReporter Assay System; Promega) were performed. Luciferase values were calculated per microgram of the protein as determined by Bradford protein assay. The protein sample (20–40 μg) separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer blotter. Immunoassays were performed with anti-mortalin, anti-p53 (PAb421), anti-mdm-2 (SMP14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p21WAF-1 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GFP1(CLONTECH), and anti-actin (Boehringer Mannheim) antibodies. Normal and immortal murine fibroblasts were double-stained for mortalin and p53. Whereas cytoplasmic staining of p53 was barely visible, nuclear p53 could be detected easily with an epifluorescence microscope (Fig. 1 A). Next, the immunofluorescence was observed under a high-resolution three-dimensional digital laser microscope (Fig. 1 B). Negative controls, including the staining of p53−/− fibroblasts and the staining of NIH 3T3 cells with secondary antibodies alone (data not shown), confirmed the specificity of the p53 immunostaining. Fluorescence digital imaging analysis revealed the colocalization of p53 and mortalin in the perinuclear region of NIH 3T3 cells that express mot-2; however, no colocalization was observed in normal mouse fibroblasts (CMEF cells expressing pancytosolically distributed mot-1 protein; Fig. 1 B). Normal and transformed human cells containing wild-type p53 were also examined for p53 and mortalin immunolocalization. Nonpancytosolic mortalin staining was apparent in all of the immortalized cell lines examined. Notably, coimmunolocalization of the two proteins was observed in HeLa, U2OS, and A172 cells (Fig. 1 B) and also in NT-2, SY-5Y, and YKG-1 cells (data not shown). In contrast, normal human fibroblasts TIG-3 (Fig. 1 C) and MRC-5 (data not shown), which express wild-type p53 and pancytosolic mortalin, did not show any colocalization. To determine whether the colocalized proteins actually interact, p53 immunocomplexes from NIH 3T3 cells (which contain mot-2 protein) were Western blotted with anti-mortalin antibody. A faint band of mortalin was detected in these immunocomplexes. Control precipitations with isotype-matched IgG did not bring down mortalin protein. Quantitation of the input and immunoprecipitated mortalin signals revealed that approximately 0.7% of the total mortalin present in the lysate was coprecipitated with p53. This was consistent with the low amounts of p53 (undetectable by Western blotting) present in these cells. To substantiate these findings, we stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells with a temperature-sensitive p53 expression plasmid, pMSVp53Val135. A clone (NIH 3T3/p53.4) isolated from these transfections expressed wild-type p53 at 32.5 °C and mutant p53 at 37 °C, as demonstrated by the accumulation of the latter on Western blotting with the p53-specific antibody PAb421 (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, p53-responsive reporter assays were performed on NIH 3T3/p53.4 cells maintained at 32.5 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 2 B). PG13-luc containing a synthetic wild-type p53-responsive promoter that contains 13 repeats of wild-type p53 binding consensus sequence was transfected into these cells. A 3–4-fold higher activity was observed in NIH 3T3/p53.4 cells as compared with untransfected NIH 3T3 controls when the cells were maintained at 32.5 °C after the transfections. In contrast, the cells maintained at 37 °C showed p53 activity comparable to that of the control. This confirmed the wild-type and mutant conformations of exogenous p53 in the NIH 3T3/p53.4 clone at 32.5 °C and 37 °C, respectively. The clone was next used for p53 immunoprecipitation. Western blotting of the p53 immunocomplexes from NIH 3T3/p53.4 cells (grown at 32.5 °C) with anti-mortalin antibody revealed the presence of mortalin (mot-2) at a level that was much higher than that in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2 C). Quantitation of the input and immunoprecipitated mot-2 signals revealed that approximately 3.2% of the total mortalin present in the NIH 3T3/p53.4 lysate was immunoprecipitated. These data demonstrated a nearly 4.5-fold enrichment of the coimmunoprecipitated mot-2 protein in cells overexpressing p53 and therefore suggest that mot-2 and p53 bindin vivo. We next examined whether mot-2 can functionally inactivate p53 by carrying out p53-responsive reporter assays. NIH 3T3, COS7, and embryonic fibroblasts from a p53-null (p53−/−) mouse were used for p53-mediated reporter assays with PG13-luc plasmid. Both NIH 3T3 and COS7 cells showed the presence of transcriptionally active p53 (Fig. 3 A). Cotransfections of the expression plasmid (pSRα/mot-2) encoding mot-2 resulted in the decline of p53-responsive reporter activity. In contrast, mot-1 cotransfections did not show any effect. Next, the p53−/− cells were transfected with a temperature-sensitive p53 expression plasmid, pMSVp53Val135, together with a wild-type p53-responsive reporter plasmid, either pWWP-luc containing the native p53-responsive promoter or PG13-luc. As expected, the cells maintained at 37 °C showed no transactivation (data not shown) of the reporter plasmids. Cotransfections of the p53 and mot-2 expression plasmids resulted in a significant decline of pWWP-luc (Fig. 3 B) and PG13-luc (data not shown) activities at 32.5 °C. Furthermore, a dose-dependent effect of mot-2 plasmid concentration on reporter repression was observed. Cotransfections of the mot-1 expression plasmid, pSRα/mot-1, did not affect p53-mediated transactivation (Fig. 3 B). Inactivation of p53 by mot-2 but not mot-1 was supported by the analysis of p53-responsive genes in cells that were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding mot-1 or -mot-2 proteins tagged with GFP. The expression of exogenous mortalins was first analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody (data not shown) and anti-mortalin antibody (Fig. 3 C). The cell lysates were subsequently analyzed for p53 and p53-responsive genes mdm-2and p21WAF-1 by Western blotting with specific antibodies. Cells transfected with mot-2 exhibited a lower level of steady-state expression of p53, mdm-2, and p21WAF-1 as compared with those transfected with the empty vector or mot-1 (Fig. 3 C). These data were consistent with the inactivation of p53 by mot-2 but not mot-1 seen in the abovementioned reporter assays. The data also suggest that mot-2 acts, at least in part, by reducing the p53 steady-state levels. Wild-type p53 has been reported to translocate to the nucleus at the G1 stage of the cell cycle. It exhibits bright immunofluorescence in the nucleus as compared with the cytoplasm, where it is barely detected by epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 A). Coimmunolocalization of mot-2 and p53 in transformed cells prompted us to investigate whether the mot-2-mediated inactivation of p53 was accompanied by its retention in cytoplasm. Expression plasmids encoding fusion proteins containing GFP and either mot-1 or mot-2 were transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 cells grown on coverslips. Expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by Western analysis with anti-GFP and anti-mortalin antibodies. The transfected cells were serum-starved for 48 h and stained for p53. Cytoplasmic p53 (detected as a very faint staining with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody) translocated to the nucleus (brighter staining) upon serum starvation in untransfected background cells. Of 155 cells that exhibited green fluorescence for mot-2-GFP, 139 (approximately 90%) were seen to have no nuclear staining of p53. On the contrary, of 89 mot-1-GFP-transfected cells, 78 (87.6%) were seen to have nuclear p53 similar to that of the untransfected cells in the same cultures. Thus, the transfected cells that expressed mot-2 (green fluorescence) were significantly devoid of nuclear p53 (red fluorescence; Fig. 4), demonstrating the abrogation of its translocation. Parallel experiments with mot-1-GFP did not reveal an equivalent effect in three independent experiments in which ≈100–150 transfected cells were examined. The data were consistent with the abovementioned analysis on p53-responsive exogenous reporter assays and endogenous gene expression in mot-2- and mot-1-transfected cells and suggested that mot-2 interacts with wild-type p53 and causes its inactivation both by a reduction in its steady-state level and by nuclear exclusion. Double immunolocalization studies with laser digital microscopy showed the colocalization of p53 and mot-2 in NIH 3T3 cells that have wild-type p53 (26Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Sugihara T. Obuchi K.

The faint staining of p53 observed by epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 A) and the undetectable amounts of p53 in these cells on Western blots (Fig. 2 A) were consistent with a low-level expression of the wild-type protein. A perinuclear staining pattern for p53 has also been reported in immortalized but untransformed Balb/3T3 cells (30Milner J. Cook A. Virology. 1986; 150: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The colocalization of mot-2 and p53 suggested that these proteins might interact, and this was confirmed by in vivocoimmunoprecipitations of the two proteins from NIH 3T3 and its transfected derivative that overexpressed wild-type p53. COS7 cells showed detectable amounts of p53 by Western blotting, and p53 immunocomplexes from these cells were seen to have mortalin by Western blot analysis (data not shown). This supported the in vivo interactions of the two proteins. p53-responsive reporter assays in COS7 cells revealed that p53 is transcriptionally active in these cells. Several other studies have detected the presence of p53 that is unbound to SV40 T antigen in SV40-transformed cells (31Deppert W. Huang M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 7: 4453-4463Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Kierstead T.D. Tevethia M.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1817-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Michael-Michalovitz D. Yehiely F.

Furthermore, similar to NIH 3T3 cells, transfections of mot-2 but not mot-1 were seen to repress p53 activity in COS7 cells. Reporter assays performed on p53−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed repression of exogenous p53-mediated reporter activity by cotransfections of mot-2. In parallel experiments with mot-1, no effect on p53 reporter activity was observed. Analysis on p53-responsive genesp21WAF-1 and mdm-2 exhibited down-regulation in mot-2-transfected cells, but not in mot-1-transfected cells. These data demonstrated the inactivation of wild-type p53 by mot-2. Consistent with the double immunolocalization data and the p53-responsive reporter assays, mot-1 did not show any effect on p53-responsive endogenous gene expression. Immunolocalization studies on serum-deprived NIH 3T3 cells transfected with GFP-tagged mot-1 and mot-2 proteins showed abrogation of its nuclear translocation by mot-2. The differential effects of mot-1 and mot-2 in this respect were consistent with the results obtained in the above-described p53 transactivation and p53-responsive gene analysis. Such functional impairment of wild-type p53 may abrogate some or all of its normal tumor suppressor activity and therefore may contribute, at least in part, to the malignant transformation of mot-2-overexpressing NIH 3T3 cells (16Kaul S.C. Duncan E.L. Englezou A. Takano S. Reddel R.R. Mitsui Y. Wadhwa R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 907-911Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An elevated level of mortalin has been observed in rat and human brain tumors (17Kaul S.C. Matsui M. Takano S. Sugihara T. Mitsui Y. Wadhwa R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Takano S. Wadhwa R. Yoshii Y. Nose T. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting that up-regulation of mot-2 may be an event that contributes to tumor growth and/or progression. In addition, a reduced amount of steady-state p53 was detected in NIH 3T3 (data not shown) and COS7 (Fig. 3 C) cells that were transfected with the mot-2 expression plasmid. The data suggested that mot-2 may cause either p53 degradation or transcriptional repression. Direct interactions of p53 and mot-2 (Fig. 2 C), along with the predicted chaperonin function of the latter, suggested that it is more likely to be the result of mot-2-mediated p53 degradation. Functional inactivation of wild-type p53 by abnormal sequestration in the cytoplasm has been reported in a subset of neuroblastomas (35Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this sequestration has not been elucidated. Our immunofluorescence results (as described above) demonstrated that mortalin was colocalized with p53 in the cytoplasm of neuroblastoma (SY-5Y and YKG-1), glioblastoma (A172), teratocarcinoma (NT-2), cervical carcinoma (HeLa), bladder carcinoma (A2182), and osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells, all of which have wild-type p53, and suggested that mot-2 may be involved in the inactivation of wild-type p53 function in these cells. Ostermeyer et al. (36Ostermeyer A.G. Runko E. Winkfield B. Ahn B. Moll U.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15190-15194Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have reported that the carboxyl terminus of p53 is involved in cytoplasmic aggregates in neuroblastomas. Interestingly, in in vitro pull down assays of mot-2 and in vitro-translated p53, a fragment of p53 protein that lacks the carboxyl terminus was not coimmunoprecipitated with mortalin in in vitro binding assays, 3Unpublished observations. suggesting that the carboxyl terminus of p53 may be involved in its interactions with mortalin. These observations are particularly interesting in the context of the presence of three nuclear localization signals in the carboxyl terminus of p53 (37Kubbutat M.H.G. Vousden K.H. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 250-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and may provide an explanation, at least in part, to the mot-2-mediated abrogation of the nuclear localization of p53. In summary, mot-2 was shown to colocalize with wild-type p53 in vivo and to inhibit p53-mediated exogenous and endogenous transactivation. The mot-2-mediated reduction in the steady-state level and the abrogation of nuclear translocation of p53 suggested a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation that may contribute to tumorigenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2114304073,"Human orbital fibroblasts play a putative role in the pathogenesis of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). We hypothesize that the hyaluronan accumulation and inflammation in TAO derive from enhanced biosynthetic activities of orbital fibroblasts. CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor superfamily, is a critical signaling molecule expressed by B lymphocytes. Engagement of CD40 with CD154 or CD40 ligand results in the activation of target genes. Orbital fibroblasts also display CD40. Here we report that CD40 engagement leads to substantial increases in hyaluronan synthesis in orbital fibroblasts. The increase is approximately 5-fold above control values, is comparable to the induction elicited by IL-1beta and could be attenuated with dexamethasone but not by SC 58125, a prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-2 (PGHS-2)-selective inhibitor. PGHS-2 is also induced by CD40 engagement in a time-dependent manner, and this is mediated through increases in levels of steady-state mRNA. The induction of PGHS-2 leads to a dramatically enhanced prostaglandin E2 production that can be blocked by SC 58125 and dexamethasone. CD40 ligand up-regulates the synthesis of IL-1alpha, and blocking this cytokine with exogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) or with IL-1alpha neutralizing antibodies partially attenuates the induction of PGHS-2. In contrast, CD40 ligand up-regulation of hyaluronan synthesis is unaffected by IL-1ra. CD40 cross-linking enhances mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and interrupting this pathway attenuates the PGHS-2 induction. Thus the CD40/CD40 ligand bridge represents a potentially important activational pathway for orbital fibroblasts that may underlie the cross-talk between these cells and leukocytes. These findings may be relevant to the pathogenesis of TAO and provide insights into previously unrecognized, potential therapeutic targets."

Early discoveries assigned functions in cell growth and stress to MAPKs, suggesting redundant roles in basic cell functions. However, ERK, JNK, and p38MAPK families are encoded by multiple genes, with further diversification by alternative mRNA splicing into a growing number of isoforms. At least five isoforms of the p38MAPK family are currently known. Some isoforms show a pronounced preference in tissue expression and selective interaction with upstream kinases and downstream substrates, pointing to highly specialized functions (17Yang D.D.

The present study aimed to dissect the many different functions of the p38αMAPK MAPK pathway by identifying downstream p38αMAPK substrates. We performed an intracellular interaction trap screen in yeast, using a Gal4 DNA binding domain-p38αMAPK construct as bait, and identified a novel kinase, termed RSK-B, similar to the RSK family and containing two complete catalytic domains. RSK-B associates with and is activated by p38αMAPK. It is also activated, albeit more weakly, by ERK1, and may represent a convergence point between the p38αMAPK and ERK1 pathways. RSK-B controls CREB and AP-1 activity in luciferase reporter construct studies, and CREB and c-Fos are RSK-B substrates. RSK-B is nuclear and localizes p38αMAPK to the nucleus. Standard reagents were from various sources as reported (45Kalb A. Bluethmann H. Moore M.W. Lesslauer W. J. Biol.

Antibodies to RSK1, -2, and -3 and to epitope tags FLAG (antibody M2) and His6 (anti-X-express) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), International Biotechnology (New Haven, CT), and Invitrogen (Leek, The Netherlands), respectively. Transfectam procedure was from Biosepra. Luciferase assay kit was from Promega. PathDetect cisexpression plasmids carrying luciferase genes under the control of CRE (x4) and AP-1 (x7) binding elements (pCRE-luc, pAP1-luc), and expression plasmids carrying constitutively active mutants of MEKK (380–672; mMEKK), and MEK1 (S218/222E, Δ32–51; mMEK1) under cytomegalovirus promoter; PathDetect trans expression plasmids carrying SV-40 and Gal4 (1–147) DNA binding domain fused to the activation domain of CREB (1–283), and the luciferase reporter gene under the control of Gal4 binding element (x4) (Gal4-CREB) were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). FLAG M2 affinity gel was from Eastman Kodak (New Haven, CT). Intracellular interaction trap screen plasmids pAS2, pGAD424, pTD1, pVA3, and pCL1 were from CLONTECH. Plasmids pTD1 and pVA3 encoding GAL4-activation domain-SV40 large T-antigen and GAL4 binding domain-p53 fusion protein, respectively, were used as a positive control in the two-hybrid assays and to eliminate false positives. A XhoI-BamHI cDNA fragment encoding p38αMAPKα was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned in-frame in pGBT9X, a modified version of the original pGBT9 vector which contains an unique XhoI site in the polylinker at position 873. A HpaI/BamHI fragment containing the Gal4 binding domain and the p38αMAPK region was inserted into pAS2.1 vector. A GAL4-AD/human placenta cDNA fusion library in pGAD10 vector was screened as recommended by CLONTECH. Positive clones were sequenced using a Li-Cor DNA 4000 automated sequencer. One class of cDNA identified in the intracellular p38αMAPK interaction trap assay (five independent clones) showed similarity with C-terminal sequences of the MAPKAPK family; it was called RSK-B and selected for further investigation. Using anEcoRI-SmaI fragment of the initial 1.3-kb RSK-B cDNA fragment (RSK-BΔN2) from the two-hybrid screen, a human placenta λgt11 library (CLONTECH) screen and 5′-RACE techniques yielded full-length 3.2-kb RSK-B cDNA according to standard protocols (47Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequences were analyzed using the GCG Sequence Analysis software package (Madison, WI). A mammalian expression vector for FLAG-tagged RSK-B was engineered by introducing RSK-B cDNA into modified pALTER plasmid (Promega). AnNdeI linker (5′-TATGGTACCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGATGACGATAAGCA-3′) containingKpnI site, Kozak (48Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar), and FLAG epitope sequences was inserted in the NdeI site 5′ to RSK-B cDNA in pGAD424 vector. The KpnI-SalI fragment from this vector was ligated into the KpnI-SalI sites of pALTER to result in FLAG-tagged RSK-B in pALTER. The same strategy was used for RSK-BΔN1 and RSK-BΔC expression plasmids. RSK-B(K65A), RSK-B(K440A) and RSK-B(S360E) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). Wild-type MKK6 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned into pALTER, and the active MKK6 mutant mMKK6(S207G/T211G) was constructed using the the same strategy. p38αMAPK, ERK1 and JNK1β1 were subcloned into pEBV-His expression vector (Invitrogen) as His6-epitope tag construct. Transient expression of all epitope-tagged proteins was tested in HEK 293 cells. Recombinant RSK-B and RSK-BΔN1 were expressed in HEK 293 cells transfected with the respective FLAG-fusion vectors. FLAG M2 affinity gel was equilibrated in lysis buffer, washed once in lysis buffer with 300 mmNaCl added, once in lysis buffer, and incubated with transfected cell lysate (800 μg of total protein, 25 μl of affinity gel) for 1 h at 4 °C. FLAG-tagged protein was eluted by adding 20 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 400 μg/ml FLAG peptide, 0.01% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 30 °C with agitation, and recovered from 14,000 rpm supernatant. By SDS-PAGE, FLAG-tagged proteins and bovine serum albumin were the two major components. HEK 293 (ATCC CRL 1573) and HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2) were cultured in humidified air with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK 293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4. For recombinant protein expression in HEK 293 cells, 3 × 106 cells in 25-cm2 flasks were transfected with 3 μg of DNA with the Transfectam procedure. HeLa cells for reporter construct assays were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4. For recombinant protein expression in HeLa cells, 5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates were transfected with the specified amounts of plasmid DNA with the DEAE-dextran method. Luciferase assays were done as recommended by Promega. Luciferase activity was measured with a Packard top count luminometer. Cell lysates were prepared as reported (45Kalb A. Bluethmann H.

Lysate aliquots (50 μg of total protein) were precleared (three times) for 20 min at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated with 1 μg of either anti-FLAG or anti-p38αMAPK antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. Immune complexes were allowed to bind to 13 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and washed, and immunoblots were performed as reported (45Kalb A. Bluethmann H. Moore M.W. Lesslauer W. J.

Precipitation kinase assays were carried out as reported without adding exogenous substrate (45Kalb A. Bluethmann H. Moore M.W. Lesslauer W. J. Biol.

Extracts with 500 μg of total protein were precipitated with 30 μg of M2 as described above. Samples were separated in 10.5% SDS-PAGE containing 200 μg/ml MBP, CREBtide, or Fos peptide copolymerized in the running gel. HEK 293 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. After 24 h, cells were transfected with various expression constructs as above. After 24 h of culture, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h in minimal essential medium containing 0.3% fetal calf serum. The coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min, placed in methanol for 1 min, followed by sequential washes with PBS and 1% horse serum in PBS. The coverslips were incubated with antibody (10 μg/ml) for 1 h in the dark, and washed with PBS. Secondary labeled antibodies were applied for 1 h in the dark, followed by PBS washes. To visualize nuclei, the coverslips were placed in H2O for 2 min, treated with bisbenzimide (1.25 μg/ml H2O) for 1 min, and washed once with H2O. Coverslips were dried, mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and viewed with a Leica confocal fluorescence microscope. A 1.3-kb cDNA insert containing an open reading frame encoding 160 amino acid residues (RSK-BΔN2, amino acids 603–772) was isolated from a human placenta cDNA-Gal4 activation domain fusion library using a full-length p38αMAPK-Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion construct as bait. 5′-RACE and cDNA library screen techniques yielded the parent 3.2-kb cDNA with an open reading frame encoding a 772-amino acid protein, termed RSK-B. The presumed translational start codon is preceded by a 5′-CCGCC sequence consistent with an optimal initiation context (48Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). The 733-nucleotide 3′-nontranslated sequence contains an AATAAA polyadenylation signal 30 nucleotides in front of the poly(A) tail. The predicted RSK-B amino acid sequence revealed similarity withCaenorhabditis elegans putative protein kinase C54G4 (50% overall amino acid identity) and human RSK1 (49Moller D.E. Xia C.H. Tang W. Zhu A.X. Jakubowski M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1); two complete catalytic protein-Ser/Thr kinase domains with 53% and 43% identity with RSK1 in the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively, were predicted. The C-terminal domain is similar to MAPKAPK-2, and the N-terminal domain to p70S6 kinase. Both catalytic domains of RSK-B show 11 consensus kinase subdomains and fully conserved ATP-binding and activation domain sequences (16Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 50Johns S.W. Erikson E. Blinis J. Maller J. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3377-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain has a protein kinase C-like and the C-terminal domain a calcium/calmodulin kinase-like sequence (16Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 50Johns S.W. Erikson E. Blinis J. Maller J. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ser236 in the N-terminal domain, Ser343 in the sequence linking the two domains, and Thr568 and Thr687 in the C-terminal domain fit the minimal MAPK consensus phosphorylation site, ΨX(S/T)P (Ψ = proline or aliphatic) (30Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Ser343 is conserved in RSK-B, RSK1 (49Moller D.E. Xia C.H. Tang W. Zhu A.X. Jakubowski M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and p70S6K (51Grove J.T. Banerjee P. Balasubramanyam A. Coffer P.J. Price D.J. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); it has been shown to be essential in MAPK activation of the RSK1 N-terminal domain (52Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Ser360 and Ser737 are conserved between RSK-B and RSK1, where they have been identified as a regulatory (auto-) phosphorylation sites induced by MAPK activity (52Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B.

Commun. 1997; 235: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thr568 and Thr687 are conserved between RSK-B and MAPKAPK-2 (54Stokoe D. Caudwell B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses revealed that RSK-B is widely expressed in tissues and various cell lines (data not shown). The physical association between FLAG-tagged RSK-B and MAPKs in mammalian cells was investigated by co-immunoprecipitation. HEK 293 cells were transfected with full-length and truncated RSK-B (RSK-BΔC, amino acids 1–334; RSK-BΔN1, amino acids 335–772). Two days after transfection, cell lysate aliquots were precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 (M2) (Fig. 2 A). Parallel M2 precipitates were probed by Western analysis for co-precipitated p38αMAPK and ERK. Full-length RSK-B and RSK-BΔN1, but not RSK-BΔC, co-precipitated p38αMAPK, confirming the C-terminal RSK-B sequence as p38αMAPK interaction domain. Converse precipitation with anti-p38αMAPK monoclonal antibody followed by Western blot analysis with M2 similarly revealed the RSK-B and p38αMAPK association (data not shown). Interestingly, a weaker, but significant, co-precipitation of ERK1 with RSK-BΔN1 was also seen; a similar association of ERK1 with full-length RSK-B was detected in most but not all experiments. This suggested that RSK-B, in addition to p38αMAPK, is a substrate also of the ERK1 pathway. In contrast, no association between RSK-B and JNK1 was detected (Fig. 2 B). To investigate a possible stimulus-enhanced association of RSK-B with either p38αMAPK, ERK1/2, or JNK1, HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with (i) RSK-B, p38αMAPKHis6, and mMKK6, and (ii) with RSK-B together with either mMEK1 or mMEKK. Cell lysates of these various transfectants were precipitated with M2, and immunoblot analyses were performed with anti-p38αMAPK, -ERK1/2, and -JNK1 antibodies (Fig. 2 B). No enhancement of RSK-B association with p38αMAPK and ERK1 was seen, suggesting a stimulus-independent association of RSK-B with endogenous/transfected p38αMAPK and ERK1. Co-transfection of mMEKK did not lead to JNK1 co-precipitation, consistent with a lack of RSK-B and JNK1 interaction in the presence and absence JNK pathway activation. RSK-B could be produced in recombinant expression only in low yield and furthermore, had a strong tendency for degradation and aggregation. This is in close parallel to the excellent study of Dalby et al. (52Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), who reported that recombinant RSK1 can only be expressed in very low yield, was highly degraded and could not be activated by ERK. To investigate whether RSK-B is a p38αMAPK substrate, we made therefore first use of the pronounced association of RSK-B and p38αMAPK and tested RSK-B phosphorylation by co-precipitated p38αMAPK in an ex vivo type experiment. RSK-B, RSK-BΔN1, and RSK-BΔC were precipitated by M2 from HEK 293 transfectants and assayed as substrates of co-precipitated p38αMAPK in standardized in vitro kinase assays, and 33P incorporated in specific bands was PhosphorImager counted (Fig. 3 A). Activation of the p38αMAPK pathway by mMKK6/p38αMAPKHis6 co-transfection resulted in a more than 5-fold increase in 33P-incorporation in RSK-B when compared with RSK-B from unstimulated cells. The C-terminal catalytic domain, RSK-BΔN1, showed a similar p38αMAPKstimulus-enhanced 33P-incorporation, whereas the N-terminal domain, RSK-BΔC, did not show any 33P-incorporation, consistent with a lack of interactivity with p38αMAPK. The specific inhibitor of p38α/βMAPK, FHPI (12Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M.

https://openalex.org/W2035580449,"The β-amyloid peptide 1–42 (Aβ1–42), a major component of neuritic and core plaques found in Alzheimer's disease, activates microglia to kill neurons. Selective modifications of amino acids near the N terminus of Aβ showed that residues 13–16, the HHQK domain, bind to microglial cells. This same cluster of basic amino acids is also known as a domain with high binding affinity for heparan sulfate. Both Aβ binding to microglia and Aβ induction of microglial killing of neurons were sensitive to heparitinase cleavage and to competition with heparan sulfate, suggesting membrane-associated heparan sulfate mediated plaque-microglia interactions through the HHQK domain. Importantly, small peptides containing HHQK inhibited Aβ1–42 cell binding as well as plaque induction of neurotoxicity in human microglia. <i>In vivo</i> experiments confirmed that the HHQK peptide reduces rat brain inflammation elicited after infusion of Aβ peptides or implantation of native plaque fragments. Strategies which exploit HHQK-like agents may offer a specific therapy to block plaque-induced microgliosis and, in this way, slow the neuronal loss and dementia of Alzheimer's disease."

As such, caspases are capable of activating each other in a manner analogous to the processing of zymogens observed in the coagulation cascade. To date, twelve caspases have been identified that can be classified into three subfamilies: caspase-1 (interleukin-1 converting enzyme), caspase-4 (ICErelII, TX, ICH2), caspase-5 (ICErelIII, TY), caspase-11 (Ich-3), and caspase-12 belong to the caspase-1 subfamily; caspase-2 (Ich-1) is the sole member of the caspase-2 subfamily; caspase-8 (FLICE, MACH, Mch5), caspase-9 (ICE-LAP6, Mch6), caspase-10 (FLICE2, Mch4), caspase-3 (Yama, CPP32, apopain), caspase-7 (ICE-LAP3, Mch3, CMH-1), and caspase-6 (Mch2) belong to the caspase-3 subfamily (2Alnemri E.S.

An alternate classification is based on the size of the prodomain because large prodomain caspases function as upstream signal transducers, whereas short prodomain caspases function as downstream amplifiers that cleave death substrates (8Fraser A. Evan G. Cell. 1996; 85: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar).

Three short prodomain caspases exist in the caspase-3 subfamily, whereas none have been found in the other two subfamilies (2Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A.

Here we report a novel developmentally regulated short prodomain caspase designated MICE or caspase-14 that is a member of the caspase-1 subfamily and possesses unique biochemical properties. Human embryonic kidney 293 and 293-EBNA cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids,l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids,l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Expression constructs of tumor necrosis factor receptor family members were in pFLAG-CMV-1 (Kodak). Bax, Bak, and Bik expression constructs were generously provided by G. Chinnadurai, IAP1 and IAP2 by D. V. Goeddel, and Hrk by G. Nunez. All other expression constructs were made in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Epitope tags were placed at the C termini unless otherwise indicated. cDNA sequences corresponding to the partial open reading frame of caspase-14 were identified as expressed sequence tags (EST) (GenBankTMaccession numbers AA103647 and AA167930) homologous to caspase family members. Both clones were sequenced using plasmid DNA template by the dideoxy chain termination method employing modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, United States Biochemical). The AUI epitope-tagged version of MICE was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using custom synthesized primers. Mouse adult multiple tissue and embryo tissue poly (A)+ RNA blots were obtained fromCLONTECH and processed according to manufacturer instructions. A 32P-labeled cDNA corresponding to MICE amino acid residues 44–152 was used as probe. Transient transfections of 293 cells were performed as described previously (13O'Rourke K.M. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24921-24924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 20–30 h following transfection and either immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted or directly immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. 293 EBNA cells and MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with 0.1 and 0.25 μg of the reporter plasmid pCMV β-galactosidase, respectively, plus 0.5–1.0 μg of test plasmids in the presence or absence of 2.0 μg of inhibitory plasmids. 24–30 h following transfection, cells were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside. Percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by calculating the fraction of membrane-blebbed blue cells as a function of total blue cells. All assays were evaluated in duplicate, and the mean and standard deviation was calculated. Recombinant MICE was expressed in Escherichia coli strain Bl21 (DE3) plysS following induction for 4 h at 37 °C with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8, and lysed by freeze-thaw cycles followed by sonication. The supernatant was recovered by centrifugation and applied directly to immobilized Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid for purification utilizing the engineered N-terminal His tag. The protein was eluted with a 0–200 mm imidazole gradient, and the recovered MICE was contaminated with an equal amount of E. coli histidine-rich protein. Final purification of MICE was achieved by ion exchange utilizing a gradient of 0–500 mmNaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl following adsorption to DEAE-Sepharose. Approximately 1 mg of MICE was obtained from 3 liters of E. coli, and the final concentration was 0.3 mg/ml. Purified MICE (10 μl) was added to 40 μl of caspase assay buffer (20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, pH 7.2) in the absence (control) or presence of the following caspase inhibitors: 2 μmZ-VAD-FMK, or 5 μm CrmA(REF) or 0.3 μm p35, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min to allow for complex formation. Residual activity was assayed by adding 50 μl of a 0.2 mm solution of the caspase substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC, and measurement of released AFC at 37 °C using a Perkin-Elmer LS50 spectrofluorimeter with excitation at 400 nm and emission at 505 nm. Analysis of the full-length cDNA sequence of MICE revealed a 774-base pair open reading frame that encoded a novel protein of 257 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 29.5 kDa (Fig. 1 A). Comparison of this protein with all known caspases revealed that it had a unusually short prodomain of only six amino acids (Fig. 1, A and C). Given this, the molecule was termed MICE (for mini-ICE). The caspase designation for it is caspase-14. Phylogenetic analysis revealed MICE to be most related to caspase-1 subfamily members, and it is therefore the first short prodomain caspase to be part of the caspase-1 subfamily (Fig. 1 B). Overall, MICE displayed 21.4, 19.5, and 20.2% identity to the known short prodomain caspases 3, 6, and 7, respectively (Fig. 1 C). The QACRG pentapeptide motif present in most caspases is also conserved in this novel caspase. In addition, based on the x-ray crystal structure of caspase-1 and caspase-3, amino acid residues involved in catalysis are conserved in MICE as are residues that form a binding pocket for the carboxylate side chain of the P1 aspartic acid (Fig. 1 C) (4Walker N.P.

Mouse adult and embryonic tissue poly(A)+ RNA blots were probed with a32P-labeled cDNA corresponding to the large catalytic subunit of MICE. A single transcript of 2.8 kilobases was observed (Fig. 2). Unlike almost all known caspases that are expressed in both adult and embryonic tissues (7Craen M.V. Vandenabeele P. Declercq W.

Interestingly, the expression level of MICE appeared to increase during the later stages of development (the attenuated expression in day 11 may be because of lower loading of mRNA). Because small prodomain caspases function downstream of large prodomain caspases, we asked if MICE, being a short prodomain caspase, bound any of the putative upstream large prodomain caspases. Surprisingly, MICE associated with most large prodomain caspases, including caspase-1, -2, -4, -8, and -10 (Fig. 3 A). The other short prodomain caspases including caspase-3, -6, and -7 associated only with caspase-10 (data not shown). MICE did not bind the other short prodomain caspases and displayed only weak self-association in contrast to caspase-3 and other caspases that strongly self-associated (Fig. 3 B, and unpublished data). The preferential dimerization with large prodomain caspases and weak self-association suggest that MICE may function through heterodimerization. Previous studies have shown that initially long pro-domain and then short pro-domain caspases are processed following activation of death receptors including TNFR1 and CD95 death receptors (19Chinnaiyan A.M.

To further characterize MICE, we asked if it was processed on activation of these receptors. 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding death signaling receptors and MICE, or the three known short prodomain caspases: caspase-3, -7, and -6. Interestingly, all three known short prodomain caspases were processed upon coexpression with the death signaling receptors (Fig. 4 A). MICE, however, was not processed, suggesting that it is not involved in the death pathway engaged by these proapoptotic receptors (Fig. 4 A). Bax, Bak, Bik, Bad, Bid, and Hrk are proapoptotic members of the bcl-2 family (23Jacobson M.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R277-R281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding short prodomain caspases and proapoptotic bcl-2 family members. In keeping with the prior results, all three known short prodomain caspases were processed on co-expression, but MICE was not processed (Fig. 4 B). Because MICE was not processed on activation of a number of distinct physiologically relevant death pathways, we asked if it could serve as a substrate for known caspases. Expression constructs encoding MICE and known caspases were coexpressed in the presence or absence of the death signaling receptor TNFR1. Consistent with previous results, no processing of MICE was observed despite the additional death signal from TNFR1 (Fig. 4 C). MICE was also not processed by caspase-1 or -4, both members of the caspase-1 subfamily (data not shown). The failure of processing of MICE suggests that it likely functions in a very specific pathway that remains to be defined. To determine whether MICE plays a role in cell death, 293 EBNA and MCF7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding wild-type MICE, a mutant version of MICE in which the presumed catalytic cysteine was altered to an alanine (QACRG to QAARG mutant) and caspase-8 as a positive control that has previously been shown to potently induce apoptosis in both cell lines (9Boldin M.P.

Like the three other known short prodomain caspases, MICE had little effect on 293 EBNA cells (Fig. 5 A, and unpublished data). However, it induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells (Fig. 5 A). As expected, catalytically inactive MICE displayed substantially less death-inducing activity. More importantly, MICE-induced apoptosis in MCF7 was inhibited by the baculoviral-encoded inhibitors of apoptosis 1 and 2 (IAP1 and IAP2) and the broad spectrum baculoviral caspase inhibitor p35, but not by CrmA, MC159, or I-FLICE (Fig. 5 B). CrmA is a cowpox serpin that inhibits caspase-1 and -8 activity, whereas MC159 is a death effector domain-containing decoy molecule encoded by molluscum contagiosum virus (26Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K.

These inhibitors function at the apex of the apoptotic cascade by disrupting assembly of receptor signaling complexes and/or inhibiting the initiating caspase (27Hu S. Vincenz C. Buller M. Dixit V.M.

Because they had no effect on cell death induced by MICE, it is possible that MICE functions as a downstream signal transducer of cell death. However, it should be emphasized that the results from these overexpression studies should not be construed to imply a definitive role for caspase-14 in apoptosis. This will have to await more definitive studies including the generation of a mouse that is homozygous null for the gene in question. Recombinant MICE prepared by overexpression in E. coli possessed intrinsic caspase activity that was inhibitable by the broad spectrum caspase inhibitors zVADfmk and p35 but not by CrmA (Fig. 6). In summary, the failure of MICE to undergo processing in multiple known death pathways and its ability to physically interact with large prodomain caspases and induce cell death suggests that MICE likely functions as a downstream active caspase in an as yet unidentified signaling pathway.

One of the most intensively characterized members of the MAGUKs is the mammalian ZO-1, which is known to associate with several cellular proteins including the components of cell-cell junctions (occludin, β-catenin, and ZO-2) and the components of cytoskeletal networks (α-spectrin and actin filaments (F-actin)) (4Stevenson B.R.

We recently identified a new Drosophila MAGUK protein, Tamou, and reported its significant homology with ZO-1 (12Takahisa M. Togashi S. Suzuki T. Kobayashi M. Murayama A. Kondo K. Miyake T. Ueda R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We will refer to Tamou as Drosophila ZO-1 (DZO-1) because we also found that the transgenes of mouse ZO-1 could replace the tam gene function in Drosophila. 2S. Togashi, M. Takahisa, and R. Ueda, unpublished results. TheDZO-1 tam1 mutant flies exhibit the supernumerary mechanosensory organs. This is a similar phenotype to that of anextramacrochaetae (emc) mutation. Theemc gene encodes a helix-loop-helix type transcriptional regulator and negatively regulates specification of sensory organ precursor cells (13Ellis H. Spann D. Posakony J.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2592-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We have previously shown thatDZO-1 locates at cell-cell junctions and is involved in the signaling pathway, which activates the transcription of emc(12Takahisa M. Togashi S. Suzuki T. Kobayashi M. Murayama A. Kondo K. Miyake T. Ueda R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Toward the elucidation of the DZO-1 functions in the signaling pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify the Drosophila proteins that interact with DZO-1. One of the obtained cDNA clones is encoding a protein highly homologous to vertebrate cortactin. Cortactin is an F-actin binding protein initially discovered as a prominent substrate for Src protein-tyrosine kinase (17Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 18Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A human homolog was identified as a protein product of a putative oncogene,EMS1, and has been implicated in both cell adhesion and cell signaling (19Schuuring E. Verhoeven E. Litvinov S. Michalides R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2891-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We now report the primary structure of Drosophila cortactin (DCortactin) and show multiple lines of evidence suggesting that DCortactin interacts with DZO-1. We also present results demonstrating the association between cortactin and ZO-1 in mouse tissues. In association with ZO-1, cortactin may play important roles in the formation and/or regulation of cell-cell adhesion and communication during growth, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. pBD-DZO885–1367 was constructed as follows. The XhoI end of the 1.5-kb NcoI-XhoI fragment of the DZO-1 cDNA (12Takahisa M. Togashi S. Suzuki T. Kobayashi M. Murayama A. Kondo K. Miyake T. Ueda R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was blunted and ligated to pAS2–1 (CLONTECH) digested with NcoI and SmaI. Deletion variants were constructed by double digesting pBD-DZO885–1367 with some pairs of restriction enzymes, one cut it within the DZO-1 coding region and another within the multi-cloning site, followed by blunt-ending before self-ligating. The SmaI, PinAI,Van91I, and AspI sites within theDZO-1 coding region and the BamHI,NcoI, and NdeI sites within the multi-cloning site were used for these construction. Point mutations were introduced into pBD-DZO1115–1253 by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (20Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). The synthetic oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: 5′-gggtgctggcaccgccttgaagggt-3′ and 5′-tcaaggcggtgccagcacccaaacc-3′ for pBD-DZO1115–1253M1, 5′-attcgcagaacgggccgaaccagag-3′ and 5′-gttcggcccgttctgcgaatggctt-3′ for pBD-DZO1115–1253M2, 5′-cgaagccgttggtgcataatagaag-3′ and 5′-attatgcaccaacggcttcgcatca-3′ for pBD-DZO1115–1253M3, 5′-cgaagcacgctgtgctgtgccatt-3′ and 5′-gcacagcacagcgtgcttcgaatct-3′ for pBD-DZO1115–1253M4, and 5′-caaagccttgcgtgcgctgctttcc-3′ and 5′-gcagcgcacgcaaggctttggtgga-3′ for pBD-DZO1115–1253M5. pGST407BtXm was constructed by inserting the blunt-ended 1.9-kbBstEII-XmnI fragment of the DCortactin cDNA into the SmaI site of pGEX-5X-3 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). To construct pMBPMCort, mouse cortactin cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and digested with PstI. The resulting 7.5-kb PstI fragment was blunt-ended and inserted into the XmnI site of pMAL-TER, which is a derivative of pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs) containing stop codons for all three reading frames downstream from a multi-cloning site. The nucleotide sequences of the primers used for the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were 5′-cattgatcatcgcagatgcc-3′ and 5′-tgctctgtagtgtgaaccct-3′. Two-hybrid screening was performed using a Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). Each of the bait constructs and a Drosophila melanogaster(Canton-S wild type) 0- to 18-h embryo cDNA library constructed in pGAD10 (CLONTECH) were co-introduced simultaneously into yeast strain CG1945. Transformants were selected for growth on plates lacking histidine and supplemented with 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Plasmids were recovered and reintroduced into yeast strain Y187 to confirm the interaction by quantitative β-galactosidase liquid assay utilizing a luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit (CLONTECH) and a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The interaction between the DZO-1 C-terminal domain variants and the DCortactin SH3 domain was also tested by the same assay. Northern blot analysis was done as described previously (12Takahisa M. Togashi S. Suzuki T. Kobayashi M. Murayama A. Kondo K. Miyake T. Ueda R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A Canton-S 4- to 8-h embryo cDNA library in a pNB40 plasmid vector was screened with a32P-labeled 1.8-kb EcoRI fragment from pcT407A. The nucleotide sequences of the plasmid clones were determined using an ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer (Perkin Elmer). Rabbit and rat antibodies againstDCortactin (amino acid residues 8–467) were directed against a bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein encoded by pGST407BtXm. Anti-DZO-1 polyclonal antibody, anti-mouse ZO-1 monoclonal antibody, and anti-DE-cadherin monoclonal antibody have been described previously (6Itoh M. Yonemura S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Tsukita S.

Anti-chicken p80/85 (cortactin) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Samples separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). Immunodetection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal substrate, Pierce). Immunostainings of wing discs from full grown Canton-S wild-type larvae were done as described previously (12Takahisa M. Togashi S. Suzuki T. Kobayashi M. Murayama A. Kondo K. Miyake T. Ueda R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-DZO-1 antiserum, rabbit anti-DCortactin antiserum, rat anti-DCortactin antiserum, and rat anti-DE-cadherin monoclonal antibody were used in 1:50–200 dilution. TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) was used for staining F-actin. Visualization of antibodies was performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig antibody (Amersham Life Science, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig antibody (Organon Teknika, West Chester, PA), and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig antibody (Organon Teknika). Specimens were observed with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Dechorionated 0- to 16-hCanton-S wild-type embryos or tissues of 1–3-day postnatal mice (ICR) were homogenized in 25 volumes of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min to pellet debris. The supernatant was then spun at 140,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was precleared by incubating with a 250-μl settled volume of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) per ml of supernatant for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was saved as precleared extract. 400 μl of precleared extracts were incubated with 1–4 μl of rabbit anti-DZO-1 antiserum, anti-DCortactin antiserum, or preimmune rabbit sera at 4 °C for 3–12 h. Immune complexes were recovered by adding 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 2–8 h with rocking. The beads were washed three times with cold lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and processed for Western analysis. By a yeast two-hybrid screen, a cDNA clone pcT407A was isolated as a clone encoding a polypeptide that interacts specifically with the C-terminal 483 amino acids region of DZO-1 (Fig. 1). Developmental Northern analysis of the Canton-S wild type, using a 0.85-kb insert of pcT407A as a probe, represented a 2.7-kb transcript in all developmental stages (Fig. 2). To isolate a full protein-coding cDNA, we screened a Canton-S wild-type embryo cDNA library by the same probe. Several positive clones were isolated, and the longest insert was sequenced. This insert has a single long open reading frame encoding a deduced protein of 559 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 61 kDa (Fig. 3). A data base search found that the deduced protein is a new member of a protein family consisting of cortactin and HS1 (17Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Thus, we concluded that the isolated cDNA encodes a Drosophilahomolog of cortactin (DCortactin).Figure 2Developmental Northern blot analysis of DCortactin transcript. 5 μg of poly(A)+RNA from 0–20-h embryos (lane 1), 3rd instar larvae (lane 2), pupae (lane 3), and adult flies (lane 4) of the Canton-S wild type were loaded. The blot was hybridized with the 32P-labeled 0.85-kbEcoRI fragment from pcT407A. The same blot probed with theras2 cDNA fragment is shown below.

The 2413-base pair cDNA sequence includes a 173-base pair 5′-untranslated region, a 1677-base pair open reading frame, and a 548-base pair 3′-untranslated region. The nucleotide sequence of the 0.85-kb cDNA derived from the clone pcT407A matched the boxed region exactly. The deduced protein contains four direct repeats of a 37-amino acid unit (indicated by anunderline), an approximately 50-amino acid region similar to the predicted alpha-helical domain of vertebrate cortactin (broken underline), a proline-rich domain (21% proline content in 167 amino acids; dotted line), and an SH3 domain (double-underline). This feature is similar to vertebrate cortactin.

Vertebrate cortactin and DCortactin contains the 37-amino acid repeats (indicated by the shaded boxes), a predicted alpha-helical domain (hatched boxes), a proline-rich domain (dotted boxes), and a C-terminal SH3 domain (striped boxes). HS1 does not have a predicted alpha-helical domain but has a proline-glutamate repeat (closed box) just behind the proline-rich domain. This feature is not found in either vertebrate cortactin or DCortactin. The total numbers of amino acid residues for the three proteins are shown at the right. The percentage of identities of the N-terminal region, the 37-amino acid repeated units, and the SH3 domain of DCortactin with those of human cortactin or human HS1 are shown between the respective bars. Scores between human cortactin and human HS1 are indicated below the bar of HS1.b, the SH3 domain of the DCortactin is more closely related to that of cortactin than to that of HS1. The sequence of the C-terminal region of DCortactin (amino acid residues 498–559) was aligned with that of human cortactin (492–550) and human HS1 (428–486). Conserved amino acid residues are represented bydots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cDNA clone pcT407A encodes the C-terminal 96 amino acids of DCortactin (Fig. 3, boxed region). An SH3 domain of approximately 60 amino acids dominates this region, and no other significant structural motif is found. The SH3 domain is known to bind to a PXXP motif often found in proline-rich regions (27Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). To determine a region withinDZO-1 sufficient to interact with the C-terminal SH3 domain of DCortactin, we constructed a series of deletion mutants of DZO885–1367 (Fig. 5). Their ability to interact with the DCortactin SH3 domain in yeast was analyzed by monitoring β-galactosidase activity. The 139-amino acid region extending from amino acid 1115 to 1253 (DZO1115–1253) was sufficient for the interaction. This region contains four isolated PXXP motifs and three overlapping motifs (PFKPVPPPKP). To identify the PXXP motif necessary for the interaction, we introduced a series of point mutations into DZO1115–1253. The mutation that substitutes two proline residues of the central PXXP within the three overlapping motifs at amino acid residues 1192–1201 (PFKAVPAPKP,DZO1115–1253M1) abolished the interaction with theDCortactin SH3 domain, whereas mutations altering other isolated PXXP motifs did not. These results show that theDCortactin SH3 domain binds to the PXXP motif located at the center of the DZO-1 C-terminal proline-rich domain, where three PXXP motifs are clustered. Rabbit and rat antisera were raised against a GST-DCortactin fusion protein. Western blot analysis with the rabbit antiserum showed two prominent proteins with molecular masses of 105 and 110 kDa in all developmental stages (Fig. 6). The preimmune serum did not react with them. 3T. Katsube, M. Takahisa, R. Ueda, N. Hashimoto, M. Kobayashi, and S. Togashi, unpublished results. The expression of these proteins in adults was substantially less than those in other developmental stages. Western blotting with the rat antiserum gave almost the same profile.3 The molecular weights of these proteins determined by SDS-PAGE are significantly larger than the predicted value (61 kDa). Similar observations of two forms of protein products with anomalous electrophoretic mobility have also been reported for vertebrate cortactin (17Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 19Schuuring E. Verhoeven E. Litvinov S. Michalides R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2891-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Miglarese M.R. Mannion-Henderson J. Wu H. Parsons J.T. Bender T.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1989-1997PubMed Google Scholar). The proline-rich domains may be responsible for their anomalous electrophoretic mobility. To examine the cellular localization, DCortactin was immunostained in epithelial cells of imaginal discs. The typical honeycomb-like images indicated that the protein distributes in a cell-cell contact-associated manner. To clarify the subcellular localization, the double stainings of DCortactin withDZO-1, F-actin, and DE-cadherin were conducted using a laser-scanning confocal microscope. DE-cadherin is a component of the adherens junction and localizes at the apicolateral region of epithelial cell junctions (21Oda H. Uemura T. Harada Y. Iwai Y. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 716-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 28Uemura T. Oda H. Kraut R. Hayashi S. Kotaoka Y. Takeichi M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The distribution of DZO-1 partially overlaps with that of DE-cadherin and extends to the slightly basal region corresponding to the site of the septate junction (12Takahisa M. Togashi S. Suzuki T. Kobayashi M. Murayama A. Kondo K. Miyake T. Ueda R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Colocalization of DCortactin,DZO-1, and DE-cadherin was evident, while the staining area of DCortactin in the periplasm seemed slightly broader than those of DZO-1 and DE-cadherin (Fig. 7, c and i). Colocalization of DCortactin and F-actin in a periplasmic region was also observed (Fig. 7 f). Regarding the apical-basal axis, the distribution of DCortactin extended from the basal half side of the adherens junction to the more baso-lateral region (Fig. 7, j, k, and l). To examine thein vivo association of DZO-1 and DCortactin, we immunoprecipitated Canton-Swild-type embryo lysates with the rabbit anti-DCortactin antiserum, the rabbit anti-DZO-1 antiserum, or the respective preimmune sera and analyzed the precipitates by Western blotting (Fig. 8). Western blotting with the affinity-purified anti-DZO-1 antibody detected a 160-kDa protein in the precipitate of the anti-DZO-1 antiserum (lane 1). This protein was coprecipitated by the anti-DCortactin antiserum (lane 3) but not by the corresponding preimmune serum (lane 2). An extra band of about 100 kDa, detected in lanes 2 and 3, was not precipitated by the anti-DZO-1 antiserum and is thought to be not specific for the anti-DZO-1 antibody. Western blotting with rat anti-DCortactin antiserum revealed that the DCortactin 105-kDa form was specifically coprecipitated by the anti-DZO-1 antiserum (compare lanes 5 and 6). These results clearly proved that DCortactin associates with DZO-1 in Drosophila embryo cells. The absence of the DCortactin 110-kDa form in the precipitate of the anti-DZO-1 antiserum is thought to be due to the instability of that form in lysate because it also disappeared in the diluted lysate (lane 4). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the 110-kDa form cannot associate withDZO-1. We found that rabbit anti-DCortactin antibody could also react with a bacterially expressed protein containing the mouse cortactin 37-amino acid repeat domain fused to maltose binding protein.3 Using this antibody, Western blot analysis of tissue lysates from a 4-day postnatal mouse detected 80- and 85-kDa proteins (Fig. 9 a). These proteins are fairly abundant in brain and testis but not so in liver and kidney. Western blot analysis using the rat anti-DCortactin antiserum also yielded the same pattern as that using an anti-chicken p80/85 (cortactin) monoclonal antibody,3 which was reported to cross-react with mouse cortactin (17Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 24Miglarese M.R. Mannion-Henderson J. Wu H. Parsons J.T. Bender T.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1989-1997PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that both the rabbit and rat anti-DCortactin antibodies can cross-react with mouse cortactin. To examine the interaction between mouse cortactin and mouse ZO-1, we conducted immunoprecipitation analysis of brain and testis lysates with the rabbit anti-DCortactin antiserum. Western blotting of a mouse tissue lysate with anti-mouse ZO-1 monoclonal antibody showed one faint and two prominent bands with molecular masses of 210, 200, and 190 kDa, respectively (Fig. 9 b, lane 1). A 200-kDa protein was detected in the immunoprecipitates of the anti-DCortactin antiserum from brain and testis lysates of 1–3-day postnatal mice (lanes 3 and 5) but not in those of the pre-immune serum (lanes 2 and 4). These results clearly show that mouse cortactin associates with mouse ZO-1 in vivo. We have identified DCortactin as a protein that interacts with the C-terminal proline-rich domain of DZO-1 by a yeast two-hybrid system. Interaction of these proteins was supported by colocalization at cell-cell junction sites in wing disc epithelial cells and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation from embryo lysates (Figs. 7 and 8). We showed that mouse cortactin associates with mouse ZO-1 in brain and testis of 1–3-day postnatal mice as DCortactin does with DZO-1 in Drosophila embryo (Fig. 9 b). This conservation suggests that the interaction of these proteins has a functional significance. Recently, the SH3 domain of vertebrate cortactin was found to bind preferentially to peptides sharing the consensus motif +PPΨPXKPXWL (+ and Ψ represent basic and aliphatic residues, respectively) (29Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quillam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A search of the proline-rich domain of DZO-1 revealed that the KPVPPPKPKNY sequence (amino acid residues 1194–1204) is the most likely ligand sequence for the SH3 domain of cortactin. This is consistent with our result showing that proline residues at amino acids 1195 and 1198 (PFKPVPPPKP) are necessary for the interaction with DCortactin in yeast (Fig. 5). We have previously shown that DZO-1 is involved in a signaling pathway that activates transcription of emc and proposed that mammalian ZO-1 is involved in a similar signaling pathway that activates transcription of Id genes (12Takahisa M. Togashi S. Suzuki T. Kobayashi M. Murayama A. Kondo K. Miyake T. Ueda R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Idgenes encode transcriptional regulators homologous to emcand are known to play an important role in the regulation of fate determination, proliferation, and transformation in several cell lineages (30Benezra R.

DCortactin is not as abundant in adult flies as in embryos, larvae, and pupae, in which developmental stages cells are actively proliferating (Fig. 6). Further, the result of our preliminary experiment indicates that cortactin is abundant in highly proliferating cultured human cells but not in adult human tissues.3 These observations suggest that cortactin is involved in both cell differentiation and proliferation. Human cortactin encoding gene EMS1 is amplified and overexpressed in subsets of breast carcinomas (19Schuuring E. Verhoeven E. Litvinov S. Michalides R.J. Mol. Cell.

Cortactin is an F-actin binding protein primarily localizing at cortical structures and thought to be important for microfilament-membrane interactions (18Wu H. Parsons J.T. J.

Cortactin also has an F-actin cross-linking activity and is implicated in cytoskeleton reorganization (45Huang C. Ni Y. Wang T. Gao Y. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol.

As we have shown, subcellular localization of DCortactin overlaps well with F-actin as well as with DZO-1 at cell-cell junction sites in wing disc cells (Fig. 7). Thus, cortactin may be included in the structural linkage in association with ZO-1. The tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by Src, which affects the F-actin binding and cross-linking activities, may regulate the cell-cell junction formation (45Huang C. Ni Y. Wang T. Gao Y.

We found that the DCortactin gene is situated on the chromosome segment between 93B3 and 93B7.3The isolation of mutant alleles of DCortactin gene is currently under progress using deficiency lines encompassing this region. Molecular genetic studies of DCortactin will provide further information on the conserved roles of cortactin in cell adhesion and signaling required for cell fate determination and cell proliferation.

Both soluble and integral membrane proteins can be targeted from the ER to proteasomal degradation in this fashion. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an integral, multidomain membrane protein localized to the apical surface of epithelial cells that functions to facilitate Cl−transport. CFTR was among the first membrane proteins for which a role of the proteasome in ER-related degradation was described. However, the signals that route CFTR to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation are not known. Moreover, limited information is available concerning the subcellular localization of polyubiquitinated CFTR or mechanisms underlying retrograde dislocation of CFTR from the ER membrane to the proteasome either before or after ubiquitination. In the present study, we show that proteasome inhibition with clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (4 μm, 1 h) stabilizes the presence of a deglycosylated CFTR intermediate for up to 5 h without increasing the core glycosylated (band B) form of CFTR. Deglycosylated CFTR is present under the same conditions that result in accumulation of polyubiquitinated CFTR. Moreover, the deglycosylated form of both wild type and ΔF508 CFTR can be found in the cytosolic fraction. Both the level and stability of cytosolic, deglycosylated CFTR are increased by proteasome blockade. During retrograde translocation from the ER to the cytosol, CFTR associates with the Sec61 trimeric complex. Sec61 is the key component of the mammalian co-translational protein translocation system and has been proposed to function as a two way channel that transports proteins both into the ER and back to the cytosol for degradation. We show that the level of the Sec61·CFTR complexes are highest when CFTR degradation proceeds at the greatest rate (approximately 90 min after pulse labeling). Quantities of Sec61·CFTR complexes are also increased by inhibition of the proteasome. Based on these results, we propose a model in which complex membrane proteins such as CFTR are transported through the Sec61 trimeric complex back to the cytosol, escorted by the β subunit of Sec61, and degraded by the proteasome or by other proteolytic systems.

Certain mutations in the CFTR gene, including the frequent ΔF508 mutation, lead to rapid degradation of the protein prior to maturation beyond the endoplasmic reticulum (4Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J.

In vitro, up to 75% of newly synthesized wild-type molecules are degraded without maturing beyond the ER in a fashion kinetically similar to the degradation of ΔF508 CFTR. Proteasome inhibition impedes CFTR degradation without increasing the post-ER processed form, but the inhibition is not complete, indicating the involvement of other proteolytic pathways (1Jensen T.J.

More recently it has been demonstrated in cell-free systems that CFTR ubiquitination is a co-translational process, and that the fate of the protein may be established while the polypeptide chain is still elongating on the ribosomes.

However, the signals that route CFTR either to maturation or to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, and the differences between the wild type and mutant protein degradation are not known. Moreover, no information is available concerning mechanisms underlying CFTR retrograde dislocation, before or after ubiquitination, from the ER membrane to the proteasome.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The existence of a protein-conducting channel that leads proteins across the ER membrane was proposed more than 20 years ago (15Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), but the structure and function of the heterotrimeric protein complex was revealed only recently (13Oliver J. Jungnickel B.

Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Polypeptide chains associate with Sec61 during their co-translational insertion into ER membranes (17Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I.M. Vonheijne G. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), but the dimensions of the translocation channel formed by the Sec61 heterotrimeric complex are not sufficient to accommodate multiple membrane-spanning domains simultaneously (16Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Versvhor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanisms of insertion and subsequent integration into the ER membrane or the excision and retrograde transport of these proteins through the channel remains unclear. It has been proposed that the heterotrimeric complex may form oligomers suitable to contain polytopic membrane proteins (16Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Versvhor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), but an association between Sec61 and a polytopic membrane protein has not been shown previously in mammalian cells. Very recently, models have been suggested in which membrane proteins are selected for degradation from the ER because they never leave or reversibly enter protein-conducting channels such as Sec61 (18Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that certain glycoproteins are deglycosylated by a peptide:N-glycanase prior to degradation (10Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 11Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu, J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L.

A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The deglycosylation process may take place in the cytosol, or in the microsomes, since the existence of enzymes with similar activity has been shown in both compartments (20Suzuki T. Kitajima K. Emori Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6244-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,21Weng S. Spiro R.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on the above information, we designed experiments using CFTR, which contains 12 membrane-spanning domains, to investigate the role of the Sec61 complex in ER-associated degradation of the wild type and ΔF508 mutant proteins. We show that CFTR interacts with the Sec61 complex and that this interaction participates in proteasomal degradation of both the wild type and ΔF508 mutant proteins. Proteasome inhibition not only increases the ubiquitinated forms of CFTR but also results in the appearance of a deglycosylated intermediate that is present in the cytosol. Our results confirm the hypothesis that deglycosylation and removal from the ER membrane precedes proteasomal destruction of CFTR and have important implications for cytosolic dislocation and degradation of other complex membrane-localized proteins. HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Anti-CFTR C-terminal monoclonal antibody was purchased from Genzyme Corp. (Boston MA). Anti-CFTR NBD1 polyclonal antibody was produced as described (22Hartman J. Huang Z. Rado T.A. Peng S. Jilling T.

Protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete Mini, Boehringer Mannheim) were used in all cell lysis and homogenization buffers according to the manufacturer's protocol. A vaccinia/T7 expression protocol was used to transiently express wild type or ΔF508 CFTR as described previously for studies of wild type and mutant CFTR processing (23Sheppard D.N. Carson M.R.

Virus stocks were stored at −70 °C. T7 RNA polymerase-expressing vaccinia virus (vTF-7) was a gift from Dr. B. Moss (National Institutes of Health). A plasmid expressing wild-type CFTR or ΔF508 CFTR under the regulatory control of the T7 promoter was obtained from Dr. D. Bedwell (26Howard M. Frizzell R.A. Bedwell D.M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Briefly, CFTR or ΔF508 CFTR genes were cloned into theNcoI site of the pTM1 vector (27Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The resulting clones were used to transiently express CFTR by co-infecting with vTF-7 vector. The same clones were used to build recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing CFTR in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase, according to published protocols (28Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B.

Prior to immunoprecipitation, cells were plated on six-well trays. 10–12 h later, vTF-7 and virus containing the CFTR were added at a multiplicity of infection of 1–2. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h. One well of a six-well tissue culture plate (∼2 × 106 cells) was used per sample. Cells were labeled with 100–200 μCi of [35S]methionine for 15–60 min. Incorporation was terminated by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline and replacing the medium with nonradioactive Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with methionine). Before lysis, cells were placed on ice and rinsed at 4 °C (2.5 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm CaCl2). Ice-cold lysis buffer (500 μl, containing 1% digitonin in 2.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm CaCl2) was then added in all experiments for co-immunoprecipitation of CFTR with Sec61. Direct immunoprecipitation of CFTR was carried out after lysing the cells in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0). The cells were scraped, lysed for 30 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Immunoprecipitation was for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In some experiments, proteins from an initial immunoprecipitation with anti-Sec61β or anti-CFTR antibody were redissolved in SDS and diluted 1:10 in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and a second immunoprecipitation was carried out on the resolubilized protein as described (11Wiertz E.J.

Metabolically labeled and immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred onto Trans-Blot® transfer medium (polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; 0.2 μm) (Bio-Rad) membranes (transfer was at 300 mA for 120 min). Membranes were blocked and probed with an anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem) and developed with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate (Boehringer Mannheim). Cells were scraped into ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmtriethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Complete Mini and ALLN) and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Fractionation was as described by Wiertz et al. (30Wiertz E.J.H.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze A. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were then transferred and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant from the 10,000 × g centrifugation was spun at 100,000 × g for 60 min in an ultracentrifuge to clarify a cytosolic fraction. All pellets were washed with HEPES buffer (2.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mmCaCl2), and then 500 μl of lysis buffer (2.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm CaCl2 plus 1% digitonin) was added to each sample. After 30 min of lysis on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described above. Immunoprecipitated samples were treated with endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 37 °C according to manufacturer's protocol in order to remove high mannose-type glycan chains from core glycosylated CFTR. Gels were placed on Phosphor Screen (Molecular Dynamics) and analyzed with PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Images were further characterized and densitometry was carried out using IPLab Spectrum (Signal Analytics Corp.). Wild-type and ΔF508 CFTR were expressed in HeLa cells. 10 h later, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, followed by chase (0–5 h). Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-CFTR NBD1 antibody. CFTR appeared as a doublet of approximately 140 kDa in either wild-type (Fig. 1 A) or ΔF508 (Fig. 1 B) cell lysates immediately after the pulse (T = 0 h). In the absence of proteasome inhibition, the lower molecular weight form in the doublet markedly decreased without any increase in the upper band by 1–3 h of chase. Fully glycosylated CFTR (band C) could be detected by 3 h specifically in cells expressing wild-type CFTR (Fig. 1 A). No mature CFTR was found in ΔF508 samples (Fig. 1 B). According to earlier data (4Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar), CFTR appears in three different forms in living cells, including band A (nonglycosylated), band B (core glycosylated), and band C (fully glycosylated) forms. Because protein translocation into the ER membrane and core glycosylation are believed to occur co-translationally in mammalian cells (14Rapoport T.A. Rolls M.M. Jungnickel B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), we propose that full-length, nonglycosylated CFTR is likely to represent a previously glycosylated form that has been deglycosylated. As seen in Fig. 1, A and B, proteasome inhibition increases the amount of the lower molecular weight form of CFTR without increasing the amount of core glycosylated CFTR. We interpret this result to indicate that unglycosylated CFTR is an intermediary that exists after CFTR core glycosylation but before proteasomal degradation. Proteasome inhibition also increased the amount of polyubiquitinated forms of CFTR as judged by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). [35S]methionine-labeled cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CFTR antibody, separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and developed with an anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 A) or by phosphor imaging of the same membrane (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Increase of polyubiquitinated CFTR corresponds with an increase in the lower molecular weight (band A) form of CFTR. Proteasome inhibitor treated cells (4 μm clasto-lactacystin β-lactone given for 1 h before the pulse) and control (nontreated) HeLa cells expressing wild type (wt) or ΔF508 CFTR (▵) were labeled with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitated with anti-CFTR NBD1 antibody, and then separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and developed with antiubiquitin (mouse monoclonal) antibody (A) and by autoradiography (B). Proteasome inhibition resulted in increased amounts of polyubiquitinated forms of CFTR, as shown in panel A by Western blotting, in which anti-CFTR polyclonal antibody immunoprecipitated samples were probed with anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody. In the same samples, autoradiography (B) indicated the appearance of the lower molecular weight form of CFTR (band A, CHO−) specifically after proteasome inhibition. M, molecular weight marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Increased amounts of polyubiquitinated CFTR and the appearance of a lower molecular weight (deglycosylated) form of CFTR were specific to proteasome inhibitor-treated cells expressing either wild type or ΔF508 CFTR. To confirm that the lower molecular weight form is a deglycosylated intermediate of CFTR, immunoprecipitated samples were treated with endoglycosidase H to remove high mannose-type asparagine-linked glycans. Disappearance of the higher molecular weight (band B) form of CFTR was observed after Endo H treatment (Fig. 3). To further verify the nature and subcellular localization of the deglycosylated form of CFTR, we combined metabolic labeling, pulse-chase, and subcellular fractionation. First, [35S]methionine-labeled cells were homogenized and fractionated as described (30Wiertz E.J.H.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze A. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). As presented in Fig. 4 A, three fractions were collected: 1000 × g pellet or crude fraction (Cr) containing nonhomogenized cells; 100,000 ×g pellet or membrane fraction (M); and 100,000 × g supernatant (C) or cytosolic fraction. Each fraction was immunoprecipitated using anti-CFTR antibody. Immediately after a 15-min labeling with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine, CFTR localized to the membrane fractions (T1 time point, Cr and M). After a 30-min chase, very low levels of deglycosylated CFTR appeared in the cytosolic fraction specifically in proteasome inhibitor treated cells (Fig. 4 A, T2, fraction C). No CFTR was detected in cytosolic fractions at the T1 time point immediately after the pulse (Fig. 4 A, T1, wild type and ΔF508 CFTR). In Fig. 4 B, cell homogenates were separated into four fractions: 1000 ×g pellet (Cr), 10,000 × g pellet (M1), 100,000 × g pellet or microsomal fraction (M2), and 100,000 × g supernatant or cytosolic fraction (C). Following a longer (60-min) pulse with [35S]methionine, CFTR processing and degradation were followed over a 3-h chase period. CFTR was present in both proteasome inhibitor-treated and -untreated cytosolic fractions at the T1 time point, and the cytosolic intermediate persisted longer due to proteasome blockade both in wild type and ΔF508 CFTR-expressing cells. Proteasome inhibition also resulted in an increse of deglycosylated intermediates in the 100,000 × g(M2) fraction. The core glycosylated (band B, CHO+) and fully processed forms (band C) were restricted to the membrane fractions and not detected in the cytosol as expected (Fig. 4,A and B). As a control, the transferrin receptor (an endogenous integral membrane protein) and β-galactosidase (a cytosolic protein control) were expressed in HeLa cells as described in methods, and immunoprecipitated from each fraction. As expected, the transferrin receptor was found exclusively in the membrane fractions, while β-galactosidase was recovered only from the 100,000 ×g supernatant or cytosolic fraction (data not shown). Based on previous studies indicating that a major histocompatibility complex I/Sec61 association could be detected only in the presence of proteasome inhibition (11Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu, J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), we pretreated cells with 100 μm ALLN for 1 h before and during the pulse labeling period. The effect of this inhibitor is reversible (1Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 2Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Therefore, after its removal, labeled proteins proceed down the proteasome degradation pathway. After a 15-min pulse, cells were chased for 30, 90, and 150 min, based on the hypothesis that a Sec61/CFTR interaction occurs during CFTR synthesis and ER processing. To detect Sec61·CFTR complexes, cells were lysed in a low salt digitonin lysis buffer (a buffer shown previously to leave Sec61 complexes intact), and immunoprecipitated with anti-Sec61β polyclonal antibody (Fig. 5 A). Similar samples immunoprecipitated with anti-CFTR antibody were used as positive controls to detect CFTR under the same conditions (Fig. 5 C). Proteasome inhibitor pretreatment resulted in the appearance of both the core glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of CFTR when samples were immunoprecipitated with anti CFTR antibody. Anti-Sec61β antibody immunoprecipitated the same doublet form of CFTR, indicating that CFTR physically interacts with Sec61 and that the complexes could be co-immunoprecipitated. Cells expressing control (vaccinia T7) proteins without CFTR were studied as negative controls. The differences in the interaction of wild type and ΔF508 CFTR with the Sec61 complex were analyzed by densitometry. Sec61 complexed to ΔF508 CFTR was detected earlier and persisted slightly longer than Sec61 complexed to wild type CFTR (Fig. 5 A). The interaction with the Sec61 complex was strongest over a time period when CFTR degradation proceed at the highest rate (Fig. 5, compare Band D). This result further supports the specificity of the Sec61/CFTR interaction, since the level of CFTR in association with Sec61 was increased at a time point when total CFTR amount had substantially decreased (T = 90 min; Fig. 5). If the interactions with Sec61 were not specific, we would have expected that the levels of complexes would be the greatest at the T = 30 min time point when CFTR levels were maximal. To verify that the protein co-immunoprecipitated with Sec61 is CFTR, we performed an experiment in which anti-Sec61 immunoprecipitated proteins were redissolved in 2% SDS, diluted in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation using anti-CFTR C-terminal antibody. Lysates from comparably treated cells without the CFTR construct were tested as negative controls. ΔF508 CFTR-transfected samples, immunoprecipitated with anti-CFTR antibody, were used as positive controls to verify that CFTR proteins could be reimmunoprecipitated from radioimmune precipitation buffer-diluted samples. Both wild-type and ΔF508 CFTR could be reimmunoprecipitated from protein samples resolubilized from Sec61 complexes (data not shown). To test whether the Sec61/CFTR interaction related specifically to protein synthesis and ER membrane insertion or also to an ER degradation pathway, we examined the effect of omitting ALLN on Sec61·CFTR complexes. As shown in Fig. 6, co-immunoprecipitation in the absence of ALLN resulted in decreased amounts of CFTR bound to the Sec61 complex, and only the higher molecular weight form was found in complex with Sec61 (Fig. 6). The result indicates that the deglycosylated form of the protein is a transient intermediate that binds Sec61 and can only be detected when proteasome function is inhibited. These results further support the notion that proteasome inhibition results in accumulation of a deglycosylated form that is bound to the Sec61 complex and is produced after core glycosylation in the presence of proteasome blockade. 60 min after pulse labeling, cells were homogenized and fractionated as described above. Membrane fractions from 100,000 × gpellets were lysed in low salt digitonin lysis buffer to leave Sec61·CFTR complexes intact. Solubilized pellet fractions and cytosolic fractions (without detergent) were immunoprecipitated using anti-CFTR or anti-Sec61β antibodies. CFTR was detected in both membrane (M1) and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 7). CFTR was also co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Sec61 antibodies from both the 100,000 × gmembrane fraction (containing microsomes) and from the cytosolic fraction. Involvement of the proteasome in ER-related selective protein degradation has been shown for CFTR (1Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the ways in which complex membrane proteins like CFTR are removed from the ER membrane and the signals that route CFTR for processing or degradation are not known. Neither proteasome blockade nor inhibition of ubiquitination lead to increased maturation of wild-type or ΔF508 CFTR but instead cause the accumulation of CFTR otherwise targeted for degradation (1Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 2Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). CFTR has also been shown to be ubiquitinated during the elongation of the polypeptide chain on the ribosome (6Sato S. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7189-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These past experiments therefore suggest that interactions determining the fate of wild-type or ΔF508 CFTR occur early in biosynthesis and do not depend upon the subsequent addition of ubiquitin side chains. Sec61 participates in co-translational protein synthesis in mammalian cells. Taken together with the present studies, it is very likely that CFTR is co-translationally bound to Sec61 at a very early step in CFTR protein synthesis. The failure of proteins to integrate into the ER membrane may act as a signal for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal destruction. In our experiments, as in earlier studies, an increase in polyubiquitinated CFTR was observed in the presence of clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (Fig. 2). In concert with the accumulation of polyubiquitinated CFTR, we also detected the accumulation of a deglycosylated CFTR intermediate, indicating that this intermediate exists along the pathway leading to the proteasome (Fig. 2). Because these experiments do not exclude the possibility that some CFTR was produced off of the native pathway and also targeted the proteasome, perhaps as a result of the transient expression system, we performed experiments using a cell line stably expressing CFTR under the regulatory control of an inducible promoter (4Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Proteasome inhibition resulted in the accumulation of a deglycosylated product similar to the data presented here. We conclude therefore that the lower molecular weight form of CFTR is a deglycosylated intermediate that is produced from the core glycosylated form. The deglycosylation process is believed to take place in the cytosol by a peptide:N-glycanase (33Romisch K. Ali B.R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6730-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, portions of CFTR suitable for glycosylation that are exported to the luminal side of ER may have to enter the cytosol for deglycosylation to occur. Microsomal peptide:N-glycanase could also contribute to deglycosylation, since enzymes with similar activity to the cytosolic peptide:N-glycanase have also been reported in microsomes (20Suzuki T. Kitajima K. Emori Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6244-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Weng S. Spiro R.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In either case, the deglycosylated form of CFTR is targeted for degradation (Figs. 1 and 4), either by residual proteasome activity or by other degradative pathways (34Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It has not been clear from earlier experiments (11Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu, J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) whether proteins selected for degradation detach from the Sec61 channel or are escorted to the proteasome by Sec61. From co-immunoprecipitation studies combined with cell fractionation (Fig. 7), our experiments suggest that CFTR can be co-immunoprecipitated in complex with Sec61β from the cytosol. This result establishes that at least some CFTR has been cut out of the membrane in a complex with Sec61β. The role of each of the Sec61 complex subunits in the translocation defect of yeast mutants has been studied earlier (35Laird V. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1983-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Wilkinson B.M. Esnault Y. Craven R.A. Skiba F. Fieschi J. Kepes F. Stirling C.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4549-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Only Sec61p (Sec61α in mammals) and Sss1p (Sec61γ in mammals) have been found essential to complement a protein transport defect across the ER membrane (13Oliver J. Jungnickel B. Gorlich D. Rapoport T. High S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Laird V. High S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4549-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), while the role of the third component of the heterotrimer (Sec61β) was not found to be necessary for protein insertion and integration into the lipid bilayer. Our results demonstrate that Sec61β accompanies CFTR into the cytosol if proteasome function is inhibited. Although the role of this particular Sec61 subunit in ER membrane protein insertion is not known, the present studies point to a function related to ER-associated proteolysis. In summary, our findings demonstrate the existence of a pathway in which polytopic ER membrane-localized proteins such as CFTR can be targeted to the proteasome through cytosolic deglycosylated intermediates bound to the ER membrane protein, Sec61β. Our findings support the notion that a general pathway, which has been proposed for proteins with a single membrane-spanning motif, also applies to complex polytopic membrane proteins such as CFTR. Characterization of the intermediary complex and its components offers a means by which biosynthesis of membrane proteins and their degradation in the proteasome can be more fully understood."

H+-transporting F1F0 ATP synthases utilize the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical H+ gradient to catalyze formation of ATP. Closely related enzymes are found in the plasma membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria, and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The enzyme is composed of distinct extramembranous and transmembrane sectors, termed F1 and F0, respectively. Proton movement through F0 is reversibly coupled to ATP synthesis or hydrolysis in catalytic sites of F1. Each sector of the enzyme is composed of multiple subunits with the simplest composition being α3β3γδε for F1 and a 1 b 2 c 9–12for F0 in the case of the Escherichia colienzyme (2Fillingame R.H. Kurlwich T.A. The Bacteria. 12. Academic Press, New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar). Homologous subunits are found in mitochondria and chloroplasts. An atomic resolution x-ray structure of the α3β3γ portion of bovine F1shows the three α and three β subunits alternating around a centrally located γ subunit, with the γ subunit interacting asymmetrically with the 3 β catalytic subunits (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). Subunit γ was subsequently shown to rotate with respect to the 3 β subunits during catalysis (4Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proton binding and release at a conserved Asp/Glu side chain in the center of the membrane (Asp-61 in the case of E. coli subunitc) is proposed to drive rotation of the coligomer. The NMR structure of monomeric subunit c shows that it folds as a hairpin of two transmembrane α-helices with interacting residues in the two helices located at positions predicted from genetic and chemical studies of F0 in situ(14Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The NMR model is supported by a cross-linking analysis of Cys-substituted proteins, which indicated a ring-like arrangement of at least 10 and quite probably 12 subunits c (15Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The subunits interact with the front face of one subunit packed against the back face of the next, with the Asp-6l carboxylate lying at the center of the four helices of adjacent subunits. The exact stoichiometry of subunit c in the F0complex remains uncertain, although 12 copies are favored (16Fillingame R.H. J. Exp.

The stoichiometry of subunits in F0 should directly relate to the stoichiometry of H+ transported per ATP synthesized, if the hypothesis of c-oligomer rotation is correct (4Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V.

Acta. 1996; 1276: 51-56Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which, with three alternating catalytic sites in F1, is consistent with 12 subunits c per F0. A homologue of subunit c is found in a related family of vacuolar or V1V0 ATPases. The V-type subunitc is approximately twice the size of that in F1F0, exhibiting four apparent transmembrane helices, and appears to have evolved by duplication from an F0-like progenitor gene (23Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y-C.E. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 24Cross R.L. Taiz L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Chemical analysis of a purified V1V0 ATPase indicates six copies of the V-type subunit c per enzyme (25Arai H. Terres G.

Biomemb. 1992; 24: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and if correct, would imply 12 copies of subunit c in the F1F0 enzymes. In this study we have made genetic fusions of E. coli subunit c based upon the precedent of the homologous V-type subunit. The subunitc dimers (c 2) and trimers (c 3) proved to be functional, which indicates that the stoichiometry of c monomers in F0 must be a multiple of both 2 and 3. Following genetic substitution of Cys, oligomers of c 2 dimers and c 3 trimers were generated by cross-linking. The maximal size of the cross-linked product corresponded to a multimer of 12 c subunits. The experiments provide compelling support for arrangement of subunit c in F0 as ac 12 oligomer. The plasmids used in this study are derivatives of plasmid pNOC, which contains the wild type uncBEFH genes (bases 870–3216 1The unc DNA numbering system corresponds to that used by Walker et al. (34Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay J.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). All three of the F0 subunits coded by plasmid pNOC lack Cys. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)2 strategy was used to construct the subunit c dimer (c 2). An oligonucleotide primer, 5′-CGCG GCTAACGGTTCTCTGAACGATGGTATCTCTGCTATGGAAAACCTGAATATGG -3′, which at the 3′ end corresponds to the first 19 bases of the sense strand of the uncE (subunit c) gene (bold italic type) and additional sequence (regular type) that encodes the amino acid sequence ANGSLNDGISA. The four bases at the 5′ end of this primer (bold italic type) correspond to the last four bases of the uncE gene. The 11-residue sequence ANGSLNDGISA corresponds to the amino acid sequence linking helices 2 and 3 of the larger and related subunit c of the bovine V1V0 ATPase (23Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y-C.E. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out with this primer and an antisense primer (primer 2) hybridizing 3′ to theuncE gene (bases 2174–2189) using plasmid pNOC as the template DNA. The product of the PCR (product A) should encode an 11-amino acid extension lying in-frame with the start of theuncE gene coding sequence. In another amplification using plasmid pNOC DNA as template, a sense primer (primer 3) hybridizing 5′ to uncE (bases 1844–1860) was used with an antisense primer, 5′-ACCATCGTTCAGAGAACCGTTAGCCGC GACAGCGAACATCAC -3′, designed to incorporate the last 18 bases of uncE at the 3′ end (bold italic type). This primer contains sequence that is complementary to the primer used to generate product A (sequence underlined in both primers). The product of the PCR (product B) should incorporate the additional sequence at the end of uncE (underlined), corresponding to the amino acid sequence ANGSLNDG. Products A and B were used to construct a sequence encodingc 2 by a PCR strategy. The reaction was set up so that during the first three cycles of a 30-cycle regime in total, products A and B acted as both primer and template. During these first three cycles, the overlapping complementary DNA sequence at opposing termini in products A and B was predicted to produce a template consisting of two uncE genes linked by sequence encoding the 11-amino acid stretch of ANGSLNDGISA. After the three initial PCR cycles, primers 2 and 3 were added to amplify this product. The final product was then digested with AvaI restriction enzyme. A single AvaI site is present in the pNOC plasmid, at bases 1976–1981 in the uncE gene in codons for amino acid residues 31 and 32. The product of the final PCR described above will contain two such AvaI sites. The AvaI fragment cut from the PCR product was ligated into the AvaI site of plasmid pNOC to generate the genetic fusion of two subunitsc and the plasmid pPJC2. This was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The above strategy was also carried out whereby a random sequence, designed to be flexible, was used to join the two subunits c. The amino acid sequence used was ASASNGASA and the plasmid encoding the fused c 2 gene was designated plasmid pPJC2R, where R designates random. A subunit c trimer (c 3) or tetramer (c 4) was generated by subcloning theAvaI fragment, or duplicate AvaI fragments, from plasmid pPJC2 back into plasmid pPJC2 DNA that was partially digested with AvaI and dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase. The subcloning was confirmed by restriction mapping. This generated plasmids pPJC3 and pPJC4. Double Cys substitutions were constructed in plasmid pNOC as described previously (15Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Plasmid pPJC1-11/75 was generated so that Cys now occupied positions 11 and 75 in monomeric subunit c. Likewise Cys were substituted at positions 20 and 66 to generate plasmid pPJC1-20/66 and at positions 21 and 65 to generate plasmid pPJC1-21/65. Subunitc dimers and trimers were constructed to incorporate these double Cys substitutions. This was carried out essentially as described above whereby the AvaI fragment of plasmid pPJC2 was subcloned into the AvaI site of plasmids pPJC1-11/75, pPJC1-20/66, and pPJC1-21/65. Dimer and trimer constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping. Trimer formation occurs, albeit at a lower efficiency, due to the ligation of two AvaI fragments into the AvaI cut plasmid. This was enhanced somewhat by increasing the concentration of the fragment with respect to the plasmid. Because the AvaI site falls in the coding sequence for amino acids 31 and 32, subcloning of the AvaI fragment from plasmid pPJC2 into plasmids pPJC1-11/75, pPJC1-20/66, and pPJC1-21/65 should generate dimers and trimers with one Cys in the first helix and one Cys in the last helix (Fig. lA). The chromosomal uncBEFH deletion strain, JWP109 (pyrE41, entA403, ArgHI, rspsL109, supE44, ΔuncBEFH) (27Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), was made recA by cotransduction of recA56 with srl::Tn10 from strain CP242 (F(+), asnA31, asnB32, thi-l, uncB108, recA56, srl::Tn10)(28Paule C.R. Fillingame R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 270-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) resulting in strain JJ001. Transduction was confirmed by UV sensitivity (28Paule C.R. Fillingame R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 270-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Strain JJ001 was transformed with plasmids pNOC, pPJC2, pPJC2R, pPJC3, pPJC4, and their Cys-substituted derivatives. Complementation was tested by transferring transformant colonies to minimal medium 63 plates (29Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing 22 mmsuccinate, 2 mg/liter thiamin, 0.2 mm uracil, 0.2 mml-arginine, 0.02 mmdihydroxybenzoic acid, and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. ATPase and ATP-driven ACMA quenching assays were carried out as described (30Mosher M.E. White L.K. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4807-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with membranes prepared from cells disrupted by passage through a French press. Cross-linking was carried out as described previously (15Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using membranes in TMG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and 1.5 mm Cu(II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)2 (CuP) as an oxidant. Reactions were terminated by addition and incubation for 10 min with 50 mm EDTA and 25 mm N-ethylmaleimide and then mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) containing 20 mm EDTA. The solubilized membrane proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a Tris-Tricine buffer system (31Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar), and proteins were transferred from the gel electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). Immunostaining was carried out using the “ECL system” (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit antiserum to subunit c was pretreated as described (15Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and diluted 1:10,000 prior to use. Subunit c dimers and trimers were generated by a PCR strategy that joins the N and C termini of repeating subunit c with a flexible sequence of 9–11 amino acids. Two dimer proteins were generated that differed in the linker sequence, the first sequence being derived from the equivalent loop sequence linking helices 2 and 3 in subunit c of the bovine V1V0 ATPase (c 2V) and the second being a random sequence of small and polar amino acids designed to be flexible (c 2R). Subunitsc 3 and c 4 were constructed with two or three vacuolar (V) linker sequences. The fused genes were expressed in a ΔuncBEFH chromosomal background that was also made recA to prevent recombination between identical sequences. Transformant strains expressing thec 2 and c 3 fusion proteins retained the capacity to grow by oxidative phosphorylation, as indicated by growth on succinate minimal medium (Table I). The growth rate (colony size) diminished somewhat as the number of repeats increased, i.e.colony size c 1 > c 2 >c 3. The transformant strain expressingc 4 did not grow on the succinate medium. Based upon immunoblotting results (shown as controls in Figs. 3 Aand 4 A), the c 2 and c 3 products appear to be expressed at levels equivalent to that of c 1. Further, there is no indication of proteolytic cleavage to monomeric products as a possible explanation for function. 3Very light bands at positions corresponding toc 1 and c 2 are present in the c 3-21/65′ lanes shown in Fig. 3 A. Very faint c 1 and c 2bands have been seen in other overexposed, ECL immunoblots of untreatedc 3-21/65′ mutant membranes, but curiously not in wild type c 3 or c 2-21/65′ membranes. From scans of these blots we estimate that thec 1 and c 2 contents in these lanes are each maximally <1% of the total of c 3 plus dimerized c 3content. Bands corresponding to c 4 and c 5 are not typically observed.The ATPase activity of membranes prepared from the pPJC2 and pPJC3 transformant cells closely matched that of membranes prepared from the transformant control expressing monomeric subunit c (Table II). The activity in the presence of lauryldimethylamine oxide is the best indicator of total F1-ATPase activity bound to the membrane and hence number of F0 binding sites. The ATP-driven proton pumping capacity of mutant membranes was tested by the quenching of ACMA fluorescence (Fig. 2). In this assay, membranes with the c 3 trimer showed greater function than membranes with the c 2 dimer. The functional significance of this difference is not clear since cells expressingc 2 clearly grow better by oxidative phosphorylation than those expressing c 3.Table IGrowth of cells expressing c2 and c3 fusion proteins by oxidative phosphorylation on succinate minimal mediumVersion of Subunit c 1-aSubunit c derivatives or fusion proteins were expressed from a pNOC-like plasmid in ΔuncBEFH(a, c, b, δ) chromosomal background strain JJ001 (recA), except as noted.Growth on succinate (colony size)1-bColony size after 72-h incubation at 37 °C.mmc 1 (wild type)1-cExpressed in strain JWP109 (ΔuncBEFH, recA +).2.4c 22.2c 2R2.0c 31.0c 40c 1-M11C/M75C2.0c 2-M11C/M75′C1.5c 3-M11C/M75""C0.5c 1-A20C/I66Cc0.8c 2-A20C/I66′C2.0c 1-M21C/M65Cc1.5c 2-M21C/M65′C1.8c 3-M21C/M65""C1.01-a Subunit c derivatives or fusion proteins were expressed from a pNOC-like plasmid in ΔuncBEFH(a, c, b, δ) chromosomal background strain JJ001 (recA), except as noted.1-b Colony size after 72-h incubation at 37 °C.1-c Expressed in strain JWP109 (ΔuncBEFH, recA +).

The positions of the substitutions are also indicated by this nomenclature. For example, c 2 A21C/M65′C indicates Cys substitutions in position 21 of helix 1 and position 65 of helix 2′ of the c 2V dimer (Fig. lA). The effects of the double Cys substitutions on growth rate are indicated in Table I. It is of interest that strains expressing thec 2-20/66 and c 2-21/65 dimers grew better than strains expressing the equivalently doubly substituted monomers. This observation argues further that the functional protein is not generated by proteolysis of the fused dimer to a monomeric protein. In a previous study (15Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), subunit cwas shown by cross-linking to pack in a ring-like arrangement of 10–12 monomers with the front of one subunit juxtaposed to the back of a second subunit (Fig. 1 B). Positions 20 and 21 of helix 1 fall on opposite sides of the face making contact with helix 2. Likewise, positions 65 and 66 of helix 2 fall on opposite sides of the contact region. In the model, position 21 falls to the opposite side of position 65, and this explains why the 21/65 double Cys construct forms cross-linked multimers on sulfhydryl oxidation. Similarly, the 20/66 double Cys subunit c construct forms multimers on oxidation, but the 20/65 construct does not (15Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cys substitutions were introduced at positions 20/66′ and 21/65′ in subunit c 2V. The cross-linking of the 21/65 c 1 monomer shows a distinct tendency to stop at the position of a c 10 oligomer (Fig. 3). Similarly, the 21/65′ double Cys mutant formed extensive c 2 multimers up to the size corresponding to an oligomer of 10 subunits c. In contrast, the 20/66′ c 2 subunit cross-linked very poorly, showing a very faint band at the position of ac 4 multimer only (data not shown). This set of results suggests that there is considerable bias as to how the second half of the subunit c dimer packs with respect to the first half. The results can be explained if the second half of the molecule packs to the right side of the first half when viewed from the F1 binding side (Fig. 1 B). In such a case, the 20/66′ c 2 subunit should only form intramolecular cross-links. For this reason, only the 21/65′′ double Cys substitution in the c 3 trimer was constructed for further analysis. On cross-linking by oxidation the 21/65′′ double Cys c 3 trimer showed products corresponding to c 6 and c 9 oligomers (Fig. 3, A and B) and on prolonged oxidation a faint band corresponding to a c 12 oligomer (Fig. 3 B). To maximize oligomer formation, double Cys substitutions were introduced at positions 11 and 75 in c 1,c 2, and c 3 versions of the subunit. Single Cys substitutions at these positions form high yield cross-linked homodimers (Ref. 15Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Fig. 4 A). The residues are thought to lie in flexible regions at the N and C termini of the molecule since Cys substitutions in residues immediately adjacent, i.e. in positions 8–11 and 73–75, also form high yield dimers (15Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the 11/75 double Cys mutants might allow maximal oligomerization during CuP treatment. This proved to be the case as shown in Fig. 4, A and B. Beginning with the 11/75 c 1 monomer in Fig. 4 A and using the multimeric ladders formed on oxidation of 11/75′c 2 dimers and 11/75′′ c 3trimers as calibration standards, note that the 11/75c 1 forms distinct cross-linked species corresponding to oligomers at the c 2,c 3, c 4,c 5, c 6,c 7, c 8,c 10, and c 12 positions. Also note that cross-linking stops at the position of c 12. Distinct cross-linked products of the 11/75′ c 2 dimer, corresponding toc 4, c 6,c 8, c 10, and c 12 oligomers, are also obvious (Fig. 4,A and B). For the 11/75′′c 3 trimer in Fig. 4 A, obvious products corresponding to c 6,c 9, and c 12 oligomers are observed, but the cross-linking results are confounded by traces of higher molecular weight material in this lane. From a series of experiments with 11/75′′ c 3, we believe that the traces of material seen on some gels at positions greater thanc 12 (e.g. as in Fig. 4 A) are likely due to aggregates not dissociated by SDS treatment. 5The subunit c aggregates are most commonly observed on immunoblotting, perhaps because they bind more avidly to the blotting membrane. Aggregate formation is promoted by heat treatment in SDS sample buffer or by freeze/thaw cycles. For that reason all samples shown here were prepared immediately before use by incubation in SDS sample buffer for 1 h at room temperature, a treatment that may in some cases be insufficient for disaggregation of all complexes. In the second set of experiments shown in Fig. 4 B, cross-linking of the 11/75′′ c 3 trimer clearly stops at the position of the c 12 oligomer. Thec 12 band seen in Fig. 4 B for 11/75′′c 3 appears as a distinct doublet. Conceivably, one band of the doublet could correspond to the linear form of thec 12 oligomer and the other band to the entirely cross-linked c 12 ring. The experiments described here, when correlated with previous information, provide compelling evidence for arrangement of subunitc in F0 as a c 12oligomer. First, both the fused c 2 dimers and c 3 trimers of subunit c were active on incorporation into F0. This evidence by itself argues that the total number of monomeric subunit c in F0 must be a multiple of 2 and 3, i.e. 6, 12, 18, etc., if one assumes that the number of subunits c in F0 is fixed and constant. Twelve is the only multiple of 2 and 3 within the range of the stoichiometry determined by labeling in the experiments of Foster and Fillingame (17Foster D.L. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2009-2015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We note the experimental values of the ratio of subunit c normalized to 3(α + β) was 10 ± 1 for purified F1F0 and 12 for crude membranes in which F1F0 was overproduced by 6-fold, the latter estimate being done only once. Using similar methods, von Meyenburg et al. (18von Meyenburg K. Jorgensen B.B. Nielsen J. Hansen F.G. Michelsen O. Tokai J. Exp. Clin. Med. 1982; 7 (suppl.): 23-31PubMed Google Scholar) have independently estimated the subunit c content of crude membranes after overproduction of F1F0 and reported 12.5 ± 1.5 c subunits per 3 α subunits. The disulfide cross-linking experiments reported here with doubly Cys-substituted subunits clearly indicate c 12 as the maximum sized multimer. The experiments extend and clarify the previous report of Jones et al. (15Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) where cross-linking of doubly Cys-substituted monomeric subunits was examined in detail. In that report, the oligomeric content of the highest molecular weight multimers was uncertain due to lack of calibration standards. Here the multimers of the c 2-fused dimer and c 3-fused trimer could be used as calibration standards. Multimers of the 21/65 monomer do tend to maximize atc 10 (Fig. 3, A and B). However, cross-linking of the 21/65′′ trimer clearly shows maximum sized multimers corresponding to c 12 (Fig. 3 B). The results may indicate that two of the monomeric subunits c in F0, perhaps those associated with subunit a, may be in different conformations that are not subject to cross-linking. We emphasize here that both the 11/75c 1 monomer and 11/75′ c 2dimer form multimers that maximize at a size corresponding toc 12 (Fig. 4). This seems to eliminate the possibility that the c 12 multimers formed by cross-linking of the 21/65′′ and 11/75′′ c 3trimers are a structural aberration caused by the protein fusion. A stoichiometry of 12 subunits c per F0 leads to a prediction of an H+/ATP = 4 if the rotary mechanism of coupling is correct. If the same subunit c stoichiometry holds for mitochondrial F0, an H+/ATP stoichiometry of 4 would lead to predictions of a P/O ratio of 2 for NADH-linked substrates, if the consensus stoichiometry of 10 H+/2 e− is correct for NADH oxidation (33Nicholls D.G.

In the V-type ATPase, the number of carboxyl groups (equivalent to Asp-61) in the subunit c rotor is half that in F0 due to lack of a carboxylate residue in the first of the two pairs of transmembrane helices. This is presumed to relate to a lower mechanistic H+/ATP pumping ratio for the vacuolar enzyme (24Cross R.L. Taiz L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

Moreover, it has been shown that all of these enzymes bind to the inner surface of the mitochondrial inner membrane, whereas purified isozymes from other cellular compartments do not possess such binding abilities (13Srere P.A.

Organized enzyme complexes may have several kinetic advantages for the cell (16Welch G.R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1977; 32: 103-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 17Spivey H.O. Merz J.M. Bioessays. 1989; 10: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One possible advantage is preventing intermediates from escaping into solution where they may be sequestered by other enzymes for use in different metabolic pathways. In other words, the close proximity of consecutive enzymes of a metabolic pathway may be used to increase the metabolic flow through this pathway, especially by channeling the substrate at reduced bulk substrate concentration. However, there are methodological problems in demonstrating thein vitro existence of such intermediate channeling within enzyme-enzyme complexes. First, many of these interactions between enzymes are relatively weak, and the isolation of their complexes from cells is difficult because during the isolation procedure dilution effects or changes in the ionic strength will tend to dissociate the complexes. Different strategies have been used to obtain the active sites of consecutive enzymes in close proximity and to assess possible kinetic advantages of such an arrangement. Datta et al. (10Datta A. Merz J.M. Spivey H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15008-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed channeling of oxaloacetate (OAA) between mMDH and CS in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitate of the two enzymes by using aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) as a trap for the intermediate OAA. Their results indicate that OAA is channeled between mMDH and CS, because large amounts of AAT are unable to trap OAA in the precipitate of the CS and mMDH. Another approach is the use of genetic fusions of consecutive enzymes, which may indicate the channeling of an intermediate substrate in solution. For instance, recent experimental work of Lindbladh et al. (11Lindbladh C. Rault M. Hagglund C. Small W.C. Mosbach K. Bülow L. Evans C. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11692-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) on yeast mitochondrial CS (CS1) and yeast mitochondrial MDH (Mdh1p) connected by a short linker sequence into a fusion protein showed the existence of channeling of OAA between these two enzymes using the same competitive assay procedure as Datta et al. (10Datta A. Merz J.M. Spivey H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15008-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the short length of the linker connecting the CS and MDH enzymes, the orientational possibilities for the enzymes in the fusion protein are reduced, and a molecular model of the complex (11Lindbladh C. Rault M. Hagglund C. Small W.C. Mosbach K. Bülow L. Evans C. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11692-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was proposed using the known structure of the porcine enzymes. Elcock and McCammon (18Elcock A.H. McCammon J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12652-12658Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) performed Brownian dynamics simulations to investigate the channeling of OAA in this model and provided evidence for an efficient electrostatically based channeling mechanism of OAA, even though mMDH and CS active sites are separated by nearly 60 Å in the model of the fusion protein. Another support for electrostatic channeling between two enzyme sites is provided by recent experimental work which shows that the efficiency of substrate transfer within dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase is dependent on the ionic strength (19Trujillo M. Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6366-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The same enzyme modeling strategy was extended with mACO, and recent computer graphic modeling studies provide a putative complex of porcine mACO·CS·mMDH complex (20Vélot C. Mixon M.B. Teige M. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14271-14277Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The model shows an electrostatically favorable channel between CS and mACO as well as the already reported mMDH-CS channel. Using genetically prepared fusions with a short linker may not provide correct data about electrostatic channeling because the fusion of CS and mMDH may produce an unphysiological orientation of active sites in these constructs. Elcock et al. (21Elcock A.H. Huber G.A. McCammon J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16049-16058Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) recently developed a kinetic model for a coupled two-enzyme system containing a third enzyme that competes for the common intermediate. They then used the kinetic data of Lindbladh et al. (11Lindbladh C. Rault M. Hagglund C. Small W.C. Mosbach K. Bülow L. Evans C. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11692-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) for CS1 and Mdh1p and showed for the free coupled enzyme system using free mMDH and CS, in the presence of increasing amounts of the competing enzyme AAT, that the theoretically derived curve matches exactly the experimentally observed data. When the kinetic data for CS1/Mdh1p fusion protein in the presence of AAT are analyzed with their kinetic model, the experimental data fit a theoretical curve that indicates 74% channeling of the OAA in the fusion protein. In this study, we extend the previous work of Datta et al.(10Datta A. Merz J.M. Spivey H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15008-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to a study of pig heart CS and mMDH in PEG by using the frontal analysis variant of the Hummel-Dreyer (22Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) method of gel filtration and by studying the kinetics of co-precipitates of these enzymes in PEG solution. Because there is a great difference between conditions generally used to characterize biochemical reactions in vitro and conditions that actually exist in the living cells, the use of crowding agents such as PEG make it possible to induce the formation of enzyme complexes in vitro with conditions which reproduce the crowding effect in cells. To ensure that the use of AAT as an OAA trap does not give special results, we also used a second OAA trapping enzyme, OAA decarboxylase (OAADC). By means of these two different OAA trapping reactions, the substrate channeling of OAA within the PEG-precipitated CS and mMDH was demonstrated. No substrate channeling of OAA within a PEG precipitate of CS and cytosolic MDH (cMDH) was detected using the trapping method. We also report the effect of ionic strength on the PEG precipitation and on the OAA channeling of the enzymes. The following enzymes were used: pig heart mMDH and pig heart cMDH (EC 1.1.1.37), pig heart CS (EC 4.1.3.7), AAT (EC 2.6.1.1), and OAADC (EC 4.1.1.3) were obtained from Sigma. Malate, NADH, NAD, OAA, DTNB, and glutamate were also from Sigma. PEG (M r = 4000) was purchased from Fluka (Switzerland). Superdex 200 was obtained from Pharmacia LKB (Sollentuna, Sweden). All other chemicals used were of the highest purity available. Salt and buffer exchanges from the commercial enzyme suspensions were made by using Sephadex G-10 columns just prior to the experiments. CS activity was determined using 0.2 mm acetyl-CoA, 0.5 mm OAA, and 0.1 mm DTNB in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (23Srere P.A. Brazil H. Gonen L. Acta Chem. Scand. 1963; 17: S129-S134Crossref Google Scholar). The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. MDH was assayed using 0.1 mm NADH and 0.1 mm OAA in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 340 nm (24Englard S. Siegel L. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 99-106Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). AAT was assayed with 30 mm aspartate, 2.5 mm α-ketoglutarate, 0.05 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 0.4 mm DTNB, 0.1 mm acetyl-CoA, and excess pig CS in 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 412 nm (25Itoh H. Srere P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 35: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). OAADC was assayed with 40 mm triethanolamine, 9.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.3 mm NADH, 2.3 mm OAA, 9.2 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase (26Dimroth P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients were assumed to be 13,600 and 6300m−1 cm−1 for DTNB and NADH, respectively. One unit of enzyme liberates 1 μmol of product/min. All reactions were measured at room temperature. The overall reaction of malate to citrate catalyzed by MDH and CS, either free or as a PEG CS-MDH precipitate, was monitored in 10 mm malate, 4 mm NAD, and 0.1 mm acetyl-CoA using 0.4 mm DTNB at 412 nm in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.1). Either AAT (10 units) or OAADC (10 units) were used as a competing enzyme for OAA. For AAT, 10 mm glutamate was added to the reaction mixture. For OAADC, the assay was performed in a Tris-HCl buffer with 1 mm MnCl2. Reactions were measured at 10 °C. Enzyme concentrations are indicated in the text. In 30% PEG, the rate of the coupled reaction was one-fourth that in the absence of PEG. The rate of CS in 30% PEG was similarly decreased. This is in agreement with the report by Datta et al. (10Datta A. Merz J.M. Spivey H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15008-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rates of AAT and OAADC were not affected by 30% PEG. The gel filtration column was a Superdex 200 of 0.7 × 30 cm pre-equilibrated in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) with 10% PEG. The optical density of the eluted solution was monitored at 280 nm with a Pharmacia LKB optical unit UV-1. The enzymes, mMDH and cMDH, were added to the column individually to establish their elution volume. The column was then equilibrated by the same buffer containing CS (0.2 mg/ml). Solutions of mMDH and cMDH were injected into the pre-equilibrated column to determine whether a stable complex was formed. The column was thermostatted at 4 °C, and the flow rate was 0.1 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and the activities of CS and MDH were determined as described above. MDH-CS complexes were prepared by incubating the two enzymes at 2 mg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 or 25% of PEG (w/v) for mMDH and cMDH, respectively, at 10 °C for approximately 1 h. After incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, giving a pellet which was then homogeneously suspended in 30% PEG. A frontal analysis method of gel filtration in PEG was used for detecting enzyme-enzyme interaction between CS and the isoenzymes of MDH. The column of Superdex 200 was equilibrated with 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and 10% PEG. mMDH then was added to the column. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the frontal elution volume of mMDH was about 15 ml. The column was then equilibrated with the same buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml of CS. When a mix of 0.2 mg/ml of CS and 0.1 mg/ml of mMDH was applied to the column, the frontal elution volume of mMDH was decreased to 5 ml (Fig. 1 A), which indicated complex formation between CS and mMDH. Under the conditions used for this analysis, no precipitate was formed in the fractions of CS and mMDH that eluted early from these columns. The same experiment was performed with the same amount of cMDH (Fig. 1 B). The presence of CS did not change the elution volume of cMDH. Therefore, the decrease of the frontal elution volume of mMDH in the presence of CS indicated a specific interaction between mMDH and CS. The column was calibrated with four marker proteins (thyroglobulin, apoferritin, CS, and myoglobin) in the presence of 10% PEG (Fig. 1 C).Arrows show the elution volumes of the same proteins in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer without PEG. Next, the dissociation of the PEG CS-MDH complexes prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” was investigated. Samples of the precipitated CS-MDH complexes (protein concentrations, 2 μg/ml) were incubated in a medium with the different PEG concentrations (0 or 30%) and ionic strengths (10 or 200 mm KPO4) for 2 min, and the dissociation of CS-MDH complexes was followed by the decrease in turbidity at 650 nm (Fig. 2). It should be noted that the CS-MDH complexes very quickly dissociate when incubated without PEG (the absorbance at 650 nm rapidly decreased). However, when the suspension of the solid state enzymes was incubated in 30% PEG at low ionic strength, no decrease in turbidity was detected. Increasing the ionic strength at 30% PEG caused, over a period of time, the dissociation of CS-mMDH (data not shown). During the first 2 min (time required for kinetic measurements), about 90% of the CS-mMDH precipitate remained in the solid state at high ionic strength (Fig. 2 A). The same experiments were performed with CS-cMDH complex (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrated that solid state complexes of CS-mMDH and CS-cMDH were stable at 30% PEG even at high ionic strengths. This made it possible to study the kinetic properties of these complexes. To determine whether there was a kinetic advantage of the coupled systems enzyme associated in PEG compared with free enzymes, two different OAA-trapping enzymes were used for the coupled CS-MDH enzyme reaction. In the coupled systems, the rate of conversion of malate to citrate via OAA catalyzed by the enzymes MDH and CS was tested in the presence of either excess AAT or excess OAADC. The same ratio of enzymes was used for all experiments: 1:2:50 by activity for CS-MDH-AAT or OAADC. A scheme of the coupled enzyme reaction with the OAA traps is shown in Fig. 3. This coupled system was used as a test for channeling of the intermediate OAA between the enzymes CS and MDH. First, AAT was added to the reaction mixture CS-mMDH or CS-cMDH. As seen in Fig. 4, PEG concentration and the ionic strength of the reaction mixture caused different kinetic behavior of the coupled systems of CS-mMDH and CS-cMDH. A reaction mixture without PEG (i.e. no complex formed), the coupled reaction (i.e. the production of CoASH), was reduced to 28% by AAT in the CS-mMDH mixture and reduced to 26% for the CS-cMDH mixture, which showed good trapping of the OAA by AAT at low ionic strength. In 30% PEG in which a precipitate for CS-cMDH as well as CS-mMDH exists, the coupled reaction was reduced only to 66% by AAT in CS-mMDH, indicating channeling of OAA from mMDH to CS. However, the coupled reaction rate was still reduced to 27% by AAT for the CS-cMDH precipitate which indicated no channeling of OAA. With 30% PEG, an increase in ionic strength to 200 mm KPO4resulted in a 3-fold decrease in the coupled reaction by AAT in the CS-mMDH complex compared with that in 10 mmKPO4, similar to the result with free enzymes. However, with CS-cMDH, the higher ionic strength did not significantly influence the coupled reaction since AAT was already effectively trapping the OAA that was not being channeled. Similar results were obtained when OAADC was used as the OAA-trapping enzyme instead of AAT. Depending on the MDH isoenzyme used and the ionic strength of the reaction mixture, different effects of the addition of trapping enzymes were observed on the kinetics of coupled systems with CS-mMDH and CS-cMDH. At low ionic strength and in the presence of 30% PEG in the reaction mixture, a significant difference in the coupled reaction was observed depending on the MDH isoenzyme used. In the case of CS-mMDH complex, the coupled reaction was reduced only to 78% of the control but was reduced to 28% of the control in the case of CS-cMDH. An increase in the ionic strength to 200 mm resulted in a dramatic decrease of channeling in the coupled reaction in the presence of OAADC in the case of CS-mMDH, whereas no significant effect was observed of an increase in ionic strength with the CS-cMDH complex. There is a difference between conditions generally used to characterize biochemical reactions in vitro and conditions that actually exist in living systems. Typically, biochemical reactions are studied in vitro in dilute buffer solutions. However, the interior of a living system differs from these conditions. For example, as shown for mitochondria, matrix conditions are crowded with many macromolecules that are bound and organized in multienzyme complexes. Crowding conditions result in the enhancement of macromolecular associations and hindrance of macromolecular diffusion (27Minton A.P. Anal. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 65-69Google Scholar, 28Han J. Herzfeld J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1155-1161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). There are speculations that diffusion of small molecules is affected by less than an order of magnitude by macromolecular crowding, and therefore metabolism proceeds predominantly via the diffusion of small molecular metabolites between the various active sites of enzymes catalyzing sequential reactions (27Minton A.P. Anal. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 65-69Google Scholar, 28Han J. Herzfeld J. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1155-1161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). The use of crowding agents, such as PEG, reduces the solubility of proteins (30Atha D.H. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12108-12117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Haire R.N. Tisel W.A. White J.G. Rosenberg A. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 2761-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Laurent T.C. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) which also induces the formation of enzyme-enzyme complexes, approximating those conditions in situ. The present experiments confirmed and extended evidence for the interaction between CS and mMDH in PEG. The frontal analysis method of gel filtration showed that the elution volume of mMDH was decreased when the column was equilibrated with CS (Fig. 1). When mMDH was replaced with cMDH in these experiments, the elution volume did not change, showing the specificity of the interaction between the CS and mMDH in PEG solutions. It should be noted that the elution volumes of both mMDH and cMDH without CS in PEG were larger than the bed volume of the column (11.6 ml). The four marker proteins in the presence of PEG also had larger elution volumes than without PEG. Larger elution volumes of proteins in gel filtration in the presence of PEG than in its absence may be explained by interactions between PEG and both the proteins and the gel matrix (33Arakawa T. Analyt. Biochem. 1985; 144: 267-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The interaction of CS and mMDH to form an enzyme-enzyme complex in PEG solutions was found by Halper & Srere (7Halper L.A. Srere P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 184: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), who showed that the solutions of CS and mMDH in 14% PEG result in a precipitation of the two enzymes, in contrast to solutions with other enzymes or to a mixture with CS and cMDH. The results reported here demonstrated that the enzyme-enzyme complexes between CS and mMDH obtained by the precipitation in PEG did not dissociate at high PEG concentrations, even for low concentrations of CS and mMDH. An increase in ionic strength caused the dissociation of CS-mMDH complexes, but the complexes (about 90%) remained in a solid state for at least 2 min (the time required for the measuring of enzyme kinetics of coupled reactions). This allowed a study of the kinetics of these complexes. Datta et al. (10Datta A. Merz J.M. Spivey H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15008-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the coupled reaction catalyzed by the solid state complex of CS-mMDH is less sensitive to the AAT trapping of OAA than the free enzyme coupled reaction, which indicates channeling of this intermediate by the solid state complex. Thus, quantities of AAT that reduce the citrate production reaction rate with free mMDH and CS by 90% do not significantly affect rates with comparable amounts of the mMDH-CS complex. The current results agreed with the previous report. In addition, this study showed protection of the OAA intermediate of the CS-mMDH complex using OAADC as an additional trapping enzyme for OAA. These results suggested that the channeling of OAA in the precipitate of CS-mMDH protected it from the trapping by large excesses of AAT and OAADC. We also show that the CS-cMDH precipitate was unaffected by AAT and OAADC, in that the trapping was the same as that of free enzymes. The conclusion is that the kinetic advantages of CS-mMDH complexes were because of direct channeling of substrate OAA from mMDH to CS and not because of the enzymes being in a solid state precipitate and restricting the diffusion of OAA. Recent theoretical (18Elcock A.H. McCammon J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12652-12658Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) work suggests that the substrate channeling of OAA is because of the electrostatic nature of the surface of the proteins between the two active sites, and the efficiency of substrate transfer is enhanced by electrostatic effects. The results reported here on ionic strength effects provide supporting evidence for the theoretical simulations that substrate channeling in CS-mMDH is because of electrostatic mechanisms.

In-frame fusion of EGFP to the carboxyl terminus of CaR had no effect on either the dose response for extracellular Ca2+ activation or CaR desensitization. Carboxyl-terminal truncations, fused in-frame with EGFP (CaRΔ1024-EGFP, CaRΔ908-EGFP, CaRΔ886-EGFP, and CaRΔ868-EGFP), were assessed for alterations in Ca2+-dependent activation or desensitization. Significant effects on the dose-response relation for extracellular Ca2+ were observed only for the CaRΔ868 truncation, which exhibited a decreased affinity for extracellular Ca2+ and a decrease in the apparent cooperativity for Ca2+-dependent activation. The alterations in extracellular Ca2+ affinity and cooperativity observed with CaRΔ868 were recapitulated by a point mutation, T876D, in the full-length CaR-EGFP background. All truncations with wild type dose-response relations exhibited desensitization time courses that were comparable to the full-length CaR, whereas the CaRΔ868 receptor desensitized completely after two exposures to 10 mmCa2+. Interestingly, the CaR point mutation T876D exhibited desensitization comparable to wild type CaR, suggesting that this mutation specifically modifies CaR cooperativity. In conclusion, these studies suggest that amino acid residues between 868 and 886 are critical to the apparent cooperativity of Ca2+-mediated activation of G proteins and to CaR desensitization. Calcium sensing receptors are part of a growing G protein-coupled receptor family, which includes metabotropic glutamate, γ-aminoisobutyric acid, and pheromone receptors.

Its role in many of these tissues has yet to be fully defined, although a common functional consequence of extracellular Ca2+ activation of CaR is a Gq-mediated increase in phospholipase Cβ activity leading to increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and a release of Ca2+ from thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular stores (11Chattopadhyay N. Mithal A. Brown E.M. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 289-307PubMed Google Scholar). In some cell types, CaR activation also leads to rapid alterations in c-myc expression (5Kallay E. Kifor O. Chattopadhyay N.

Calcium sensing receptors represent a novel member of a growing family of G protein-coupled receptors (family C), which include metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) (12Masu M. Tanabe Y.

Cell. 1997; 90: 775-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Agonists for this family of receptors represent simple molecules present in the extracellular milieu,e.g. amino acids and ions, and these receptors most likely developed as a fusion between bacterial periplasmic binding proteins and the seven transmembrane/signaling domains common to G protein-coupled receptors (19Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), rather than in a pocket defined by the seven transmembrane helices as is characteristic of most G protein-coupled receptors (22Strader C.D.

A cluster of CaR mutations identified in patients with hyper- and hypoparathyroidism, which affect CaR affinity for Ca2+, cluster within the extracellular domain (11Chattopadhyay N. Mithal A. Brown E.M. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 289-307PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting this as the location of the Ca2+ binding site(s). Activation of CaR by extracellular Ca2+ is highly cooperative (Hill coefficients for activation in the range of 2–4) both in vivo (24Brown E.M. Chen C.J. LeBoff M.S. Kifor O. Oetting M.H. El-Hajj G. J. Gen. Physiol. Symp. 1988; 44: 251-268Google Scholar) and in vitro (25Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and although the molecular mechanism is undefined, it has been suggested to result from multiple Ca2+ binding sites (25Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5972-5975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A second distinctive feature of many members of this receptor superfamily is the large intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain. Several mGluR genes are alternatively spliced to produce receptors having variations within the carboxyl terminus (27Pin J.-P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Studies on heterologously expressed mGluR1 (a, b, or c) or mGluR5 (a or b) variants suggest that carboxyl-terminal differences affect receptor-mediated signaling (28Flor P.J. Gomeza J. Tones M.A. Kuhn R. Pin J.-P. Knopfel T. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Mary S. Gomeza J. Prezeau L. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 425-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as well as the level of agonist-independent activity (30Prezeau L. Gomeza J. Ahern S. Mary S. Galvez T. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar). Further, the carboxyl-terminal domain of mGluR1 has been shown to affect the sensitivity of the receptor to agonist in chimeras having identical NH2-terminal agonist-binding domains (28Flor P.J. Gomeza J. Tones M.A. Kuhn R. Pin J.-P. Knopfel T. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally, the large carboxyl terminus may be involved in interactions with proteins that assist in transport of expressed receptors to the plasma membrane, as has been shown for Homer-mediated trafficking of mGluRs (31Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Calcium sensing receptors also have a large carboxyl terminus (>210 amino acids). Truncations within the carboxyl terminus have recently been shown to severely limit phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis when the residual carboxyl terminus was limited to <15 amino acids, and a region between amino acids 874 and 888 has been identified as crucial to normal signal transduction (32Ray K. Fan G.-F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this report, we explore the functional consequences of carboxyl-terminal truncations in greater detail, utilizing an assay with enhanced sensitivity and time resolution, applied to individual cells. In order to resolve subtle differences in receptor function, we have characterized the truncations with respect to both the dose-response relation for Ca2+-dependent activation and CaR desensitization, since desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors often involves phosphorylation and/or conformation-dependent exposure of sequestration motifs within the carboxyl-terminal domain (33Grady E.F. Bohm S.K. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G586-G601PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. News Physiol. Sci. 1997; 12: 145-151Google Scholar). Finally, all studies were performed with CaR constructs fused to EGFP at the carboxyl terminus, to allow identification of cells expressing receptors. We find that carboxyl-terminal fusion with EGFP does not affect the functional properties of CaR, and provides a useful marker for assessment of absolute expression levels of CaR within the cell. Modest truncations of the carboxyl terminus (CaRΔ1024, CaRΔ908, and CaRΔ886) had no effect on membrane localization, Ca2+ dose response, or rates of desensitization, whereas truncation CaRΔ868 both altered the dose-response relation for Ca2+ and enhanced desensitization. Finally, a point mutation T876D in the full-length CaR-EGFP background recapitulated the effects observed with CaRΔ868 with respect to the Ca2+ dose-response relation, suggesting that this residue is critically involved in determining the cooperativity of G protein activation. The full-length human CaR clone (in pBluescript) was provided by Dr. Jim Garrett of NPS Pharmaceuticals (Salt Lake City, UT); pEGFP was obtained from CLONTECH. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies Inc. and New England Biolabs. PCR reactions were performed withPfuI polymerase (Stratagene) using 94, 53, and 72 °C as denaturing, annealing, and elongation temperatures, respectively. All constructs were confirmed by restriction digests and automated sequencing. Full-length human CaR was subcloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) after HindIII-NotI digestion (pCCaR). In order to facilitate identification of transfected cells, CaR and EGFP were sometimes expressed behind different promoters in the same mammalian expression vector (described as CaR construct/EGFP). The EGFP gene was excised from its original vector (pEGFP-N1;CLONTECH) by NheI-NotI digestion and inserted downstream of the SV40 promoter of pCCaR after digestion with BstBI-AvrII (replacing the neomycin resistance gene). To create a CaR-EGFP fusion protein, a two-step cloning procedure was used. First, a PCR product was generated using a 5′ primer which anneals before the XmaI site of pBluescript/CaR (TTC CGC AAC ACA CCC ATT GTC AAG G), and a 3′ primer in which the CaR gene stop codon was replaced by a BclI site (GCT GAT CAA CTA CGT TTT CTG TAA CAG T). After PCR amplification, the product was digested with XmaI and subcloned back into the original template using XmaI and a T4 polymerase filled-inNotI site. The final chimeric gene was created by excising the mutated CaR gene from pBluescript/mutCaR usingNotI-BclI and inserting it between theNotI-BamHI sites of pEGFP (CLONTECH). Two of the truncations were constructed by direct subcloning of portions of the CaR gene from pBluescript/CaR into pEGFP (CLONTECH). For CaRΔ886-EGFP, the CaR gene was cut and subcloned into pEGFP-N1 withHindIII-XmaI. The same was done for CaRΔ908-EGFP using HindIII-BamHI and pEGFP-N3. For two other truncations (CaRΔ1024-EGFP and CaRΔ868-EGFP), site-directed mutagenesis PCR products were generated using pBluescript/CaR as a template, a common 5′ primer (GAA TTG TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC GA) and 3′ primers containing an in-frameBamHI site (CGG TCG GAT CCA AGT CCG TTT CCC C for CaRΔ1024-EGFP and GGC GAT GGA TCC GGT GTT GCG GGA TGG C for CaRΔ868-EGFP). The PCR products were cut withHindIII-BamHI, purified by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, isolated, and subcloned into pEGFP. CaRΔ868 was also cloned into pCCaR/EGFP, replacing the full-length CaR gene. The PCR strategy described above was performed, using the same 5′ primer and a 3′ primer containing a stop codon immediately before a BamHI site (CAA CGC GGA TCC TAG ATG GTG TTG CGG GAT GG). CaR-T876D-EGFP was produced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the CaR-EGFP construct as template (5′ primer, GCA CCT CCT CGA TGG TGT TGC G, 3′ primer GTT GCA GCG ACG CAG CTC ACG C). Fig. 1 illustrates the topology of the human CaR, the location within the carboxyl-terminal domain of the various truncations, and the fusion proteins that were produced with EGFP. HEK-293 cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (37 °C, 5% CO2). Cells were transfected with 1 μg of each construct using Superfect (Quiagen), plated on collagen-coated coverslips, and kept in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C until use. Some constructs (CaR, CaR/EGFP, CaR-EGFP, CaRΔ868, and CaRΔ868-EGFP) were also stably transfected after linearization with SspI. The constructs CaR/EGFP and CaRΔ868/EGFP did not contain a neomycin resistance gene and were therefore cotransfected with linearized pCDNA3.1 in a 10:1 ratio. Cells were kept in medium containing 300 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Colonies were selected after 3 weeks, and clones were confirmed by both cell fluorescence and CaR activity. Coverslips containing transfected HEK-293 cells were fixed with acetone for 5 min at −20 °C, mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and viewed with a Noran Oz confocal microscopy system. Transfected cells were identified by viewing green fluorescent protein fluorescence with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter (cells were either transfected with CaR-EGFP fusion proteins or a vector which independently expresses both CaR and EGFP). Cells were loaded with 0.5 μm fura-2-AM (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 37 °C in a solution containing (in mm): 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 20 HEPES, 0.83 Na2HPO4, 0.17 NaH2PO4, and 25 mannose, plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Following the loading period, the coverslip was mounted in an imaging chamber (Warner Instruments) having both a top and bottom coverslip, and washed with 0.5 mmCa2+ bath solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.55 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Selected regions of the field were excited at 340/380 nm (emission wavelength 510 nm) at 8-s intervals (8 frame averaging) on a Universal imaging system based on the MetaFluor software package. Background images at the same settings used during a particular experiment were obtained on regions of the coverslip devoid of cells. All solutions were osmolality-matched (290–300 mOsm), measured on a Wescor 5500 vapor pressure osmometer (Salt Lake City, UT). Variations in extracellular Ca2+ concentration were produced by isosmolar substitution for NaCl. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C). Multiple cells were analyzed from at least three independent transfections or cell passages (for stably transfected cell lines). Data were normalized/averaged as described in the text, and are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. Curves were fitted by least squares minimization using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm (NFIT, Island Products, Galveston, TX). To determine the localization and expression levels of the various CaR constructs, carboxyl-terminal fusions to EGFP were used (Fig. 1 B). Preliminary studies were performed to confirm that EGFP did not affect the functional properties of CaR. Expression of both CaR and CaR-EGFP under either transient transfection conditions or in stable cell lines was robust, with both constructs yielding responses of similar magnitude. Figs. 2 and 3illustrate the functional properties of CaR which were used as a basis for comparing all of the CaR truncations. Extracellular Ca2+-dependent activation of CaR stably expressed in HEK-293 cells is illustrated in Fig. 2 A, with sequential applications of extracellular Ca2+ in the range from 2.5 to 30 mm (60–90 s exposure to each Ca2+ concentration). The averaged dose-response relations for Ca2+-mediated activation of both CaR and CaR-EGFP are illustrated in Fig. 2 B. There were no differences in either EC50 (CaR, 3.3 ± 0.3 mm; CaR-EGFP, 3.5 ± 0.2 mm) or Hill coefficient (CaR, 2 ± 0.3; CaR-EGFP, 2.3 ± 0.3) for Ca2+-mediated activation of CaR introduced by carboxyl-terminal fusion of EGFP to CaR.Figure 3Desensitization of full-length calcium sensing receptors.

Cells expressing CaR-EGFP but not loaded with fura-2-AM were exposed to 0.5 and 10 mm extracellular Ca2+ and the fluorescence measured at an emission wavelength of 510 nm (excitation wavelengths were 340 and 380 nm). The 340/380 fluorescence ratio was low (<0.5) and was unchanged by alterations in bath Ca2+. A second control determined the intracellular Ca2+ responses to changes in extracellular Ca2+ concentrations in the range from 1.5 to 30 mm in untransfected or vector (pCDNA3.1)-transfected HEK-293 cells. No significant changes in intracellular Ca2+were elicited in the absence of CaR. A further means of comparing the functional properties of CaR and CaR-EGFP was to assess the rate of desensitization of the intracellular Ca2+ response to repeated exposures to 10 mmextracellular Ca2+. Fig. 3 (A and B) illustrates the protocols used. For protocol 1 (illustrated in Fig. 3 A), cells stably transfected with CaR were alternately exposed to 10 mm bath Ca2+ for 2 min, followed by 0.5 mm Ca2+ for 3 min. This protocol resulted in a modest rate of CaR desensitization over a 30-min period, as reflected by the peak response to successive 10 mmCa2+ applications. Protocol 2 (illustrated in Fig. 3 B) utilized a 4-min exposure to 10 mmCa2+, followed by a 2-min “recovery” period in 0.5 mm Ca2+. This protocol resulted in significant desensitization of CaR (≈40–50%) over a 30 min experiment. The responses to both protocols strongly suggest that the decline in response is due to CaR desensitization and not to slow depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, since the extent of desensitization is proportional to the duration of receptor stimulation. Fig. 3 C illustrates the time courses for desensitization of the peak intracellular Ca2+ responses for CaR and CaR-EGFP for the two protocols, with all data normalized to the first peak response to 10 mm Ca2+ of each cell. Carboxyl-terminal fusion of CaR to EGFP had no effect on the rate(s) of receptor desensitization. Truncations of the carboxyl terminus of CaR were produced as fusion proteins with EGFP, as illustrated in Fig. 1 B. Each construct was assessed for its cellular distribution prior to functional studies. Illustrated in Fig. 4 are the cellular distributions for constructs expressing full-length CaR plus soluble EGFP (A), full-length carboxyl-terminal fusion of CaR to EGFP, CaR-EGFP (B), and truncations fused in-frame to EGFP, CaRΔ1024-EGFP (C), CaRΔ908-EGFP (D), CaRΔ886-EGFP (E), and CaRΔ868-EGFP (F). There is a clear distinction between cytoplasmic, soluble EGFP (A)versus membrane-localized EGFP (B–F). All EGFP fusion proteins localize to membranes both within the cell and at the plasma membrane. Despite significant intracellular localization, a correlation between EGFP fluorescence intensity (fluorescein isothiocyanate filter) and plasma membrane localization assessed by increases in intracellular Ca2+ (fura-2 fluorescence changes) existed for all CaR-EGFP constructs. Experiments such as those illustrated in Fig. 2 A were performed to assess the dose-response relations for extracellular Ca2+-mediated activation of the CaR carboxyl-terminal truncations. Fig. 5 illustrates the results of fits to data averaged from at least three independent transfections for each construct, and Table I indicates the parameters of the fits. Only CaRΔ868-EGFP exhibited a difference in response to extracellular Ca2+, with both a decreased affinity for Ca2+ (EC50 of 10.9 mm) and a reduction in the Hill coefficient (from the range of 2.0–2.9 down to 1.1). Since the Δ868 truncation leaves a cytoplasmic tail of only 8 amino acids, we also determined the dose-response relation for an additional construct, CaRΔ868 (coexpressed with soluble EGFP) to eliminate the possibility that EGFP presented a physical barrier for access of G proteins to their sites of interaction with CaR. HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing CaRΔ868 were produced and the dose-response relationship for extracellular Ca2+determined. Results were similar for both the CaRΔ868-EGFP and CaRΔ868 constructs (data combined in Fig. 5 and Table I), implying that the decreased responsiveness to Ca2+ is a result of the truncation and not of the carboxyl-terminal fusion to EGFP.Table IComparison of dose-response relations obtained for full-length human CaR and carboxyl-terminal truncations, expressed in human embryonic kidney cellsCaR construct(s)NormalizedR maxEC50Hill coefficientmmnCaR97.6 ± 3.43.3 ± 0.32.0 ± 0.3CaR-EGFP103.4 ± 2.93.5 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.3CaRΔ1024-EGFP96.9 ± 1.92.0 ± 0.142.8 ± 0.6CaRΔ908-EGFP96.6 ± 3.73.78 ± 0.52.7 ± 0.7CaRΔ886-EGFP98.1 ± 1.43.2 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.3CaRΔ868-EGFP/CaRΔ868128.7 ± 3210.9 ± 61.1 ± 0.3CaR-T876D-EGFP116.9 ± 138.38 ± 1.51.5 ± 0.4Data from at least 50 cells from at least three independent experiments (CaR and CaR-EGFP, CaRΔ868) or three independent transfections (CaRΔ1024-EGFP, CaRΔ908-EGFP, CaRΔ886-EGFP, and CaRΔ868-EGFP) were combined, normalized to the peak response at 30 mmCa2+, and fitted with the following equation: R= R max/(1 + (EC50/[Ca2+])n).

The progressive desensitization of peak intracellular Ca2+ in response to repeated exposures to 10 mm extracellular Ca2+ was assessed for all of the CaR carboxyl-terminal truncations, according to the two protocols described, i.e.protocol 1, 2 min 10 mm Ca2+/3 min 0.5 mm Ca2+; and protocol 2, 4 min 10 mm Ca2+/2 min 0.5 mmCa2+. Illustrated in Fig. 6are the combined data for all CaR carboxyl-terminal truncations. For CaRΔ1024-EGFP, CaRΔ908-EGFP, and CaRΔ886-EGFP, desensitization was unchanged from that observed for full-length CaR (lines drawn in the figure represent desensitization of full-length CaR in response to the two protocols, redrawn from Fig. 3 C). Desensitization of CaRΔ868-EGFP, however, was significantly enhanced, with full desensitization occurring after two applications of agonist. Results with the truncations suggest that the region between amino acids 868 and 886 is critical for normal functioning of CaR by several criteria; 1) CaRΔ868 exhibits a decrease in the apparent affinity for extracellular Ca2+, 2) the degree of cooperativity as reflected in the Hill coefficient is decreased, and 3) desensitization of CaRΔ868 is significantly increased. The region between amino acids 874 and 888 has been previously identified as important in normal signal transduction (32Ray K. Fan G.-F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2149453003,"We have identified a novel serine/threonine kinase belonging to the myotonic dystrophy kinase family. The kinase can be produced in at least two different isoforms: a ∼240-kDa protein (Citron Rho-interacting kinase, CRIK), in which the kinase domain is followed by the sequence of Citron, a previously identified Rho/Rac binding protein; a ∼54-kDa protein (CRIK-short kinase (SK)), which consists mostly of the kinase domain. CRIK and CRIK-SK proteins are capable of phosphorylating exogenous substrates as well as of autophosphorylation, when tested by in vitro kinase assays after expression into COS7 cells. CRIK kinase activity is increased severalfold by coexpression of costitutively active Rho, while active Rac has more limited effects. Kinase activity of endogenous CRIK is indicated by in vitro kinase assays after immunoprecipitation with antibodies recognizing the Citron moiety of the protein. When expressed in keratinocytes, full-length CRIK, but not CRIK-SK, localizes into corpuscular cytoplasmic structures and elicits recruitment of actin into these structures. The previously reported Rho-associated kinases ROCK I and II are ubiquitously expressed.

Small GTPases of the Rho family, including Rho-A, -B, and -C; Rac-1 and -2; and CDC42, have been intimately connected with dynamic control of cell structure, as well as downstream transcriptional events (1Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 2Van Aelst L. Souza-Schorey D.C.

Activated Rho GTPases have been shown to trigger distinctive kinase cascades. In particular, the Rho-binding serine/threonine kinase (ROCK)1 binds to Rho (5Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), and its kinase activity is moderately stimulated (2–5-fold) by this association (6Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Moreover, activated Rho has been reported to promote translocation of the ROCK kinase to the membrane (7Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), and this in turn may facilitate recognition of specific substrates. In addition, Rho can function as a bridge between ROCK and selected substrates, such as the myosin-binding subunit of the myosin light chain phosphatase, and the myosin light chain itself (8Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 9Amano M.

A number of other proteins have been identified which associate specifically with the activated form of Rho (10Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 11Mukai H. Toshimori M. Shibata H. Kitagawa M. Shimakawa M. Miyahara M. Sunakawa H. Ono Y. J. Biol.

Some of these molecules may also be effectors of Rho function, while others may modulate function of bona fide effectors (such as ROCK). One of these molecules is Citron (10Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which was identified using the yeast two-hybrid system and overlay assays, as a specific interactor of Rho and Rac but not CDC42. Citron was found to share a significant degree of structural homology with ROCK. However, it contained no kinase domain, leaving open the question of its biochemical function. We report here the identification of a novel serine/threonine protein kinase of the myotonic dystrophy kinase family, CRIK (Citron Rho-interactingkinase, which can be produced into two forms as the result of differential splicing, a smaller size protein kinase, with a region of homology with the myotonic dystrophy and PK428 kinases extending beyond the kinase domain, and a much larger protein, in which most of the shorter form of the kinase is fused to all of Citron except its first 8 amino acids. Unlike ROCK, CRIK is expressed in a restricted number of tissues, suggesting that this kinase may serve a more specialized function in specific cell types. The KK-1 clone was obtained by PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides for protein kinases from a cDNA library from mouse primary keratinocytes, essentially as described by Holzmanet al. (14Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both 5′- and 3′-directed rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR were performed with two nested amplification primers using as template a spleen Marathon-ReadyTMcDNA (CLONTECH), according to the manufacturer's specifications. In every case the clones obtained were sequenced on both strands using the Thermo-Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequence similarity searches were performed using the Blastnt and Blastx programs at the NCBI on the Non Redundant Data base. Alignment of the kinase domain sequences was obtained using the CLUSTAL method. Total and poly(A)+ RNA were extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar, 16Calautti E. Sara Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Radioactive probes corresponded to nucleotides 810–2260 of CRIK-SK (short kinase) and nucleotides 1610–2240 of the published mouse Citron cDNA sequence (10Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR analysis, 100 ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed with an RNase H-Moloney murine leukemia virus enzyme (Promega) after random priming. The kinase domain-specific forward oligonucleotide (KS) corresponded to nucleotides 1849–1873, while the three different Citron-specific reverse oligonucleotides corresponded to nucleotides 1289–1264 (CS1), 1755–1729 (CS2), and 2715–2692 (CS3) of the Citron sequence. For expression of CRIK-SK, a fragment of the CRIK-SK cDNA from nucleotide 810 to 2260 was amplified from the full-length CRIK-SK and cloned in frame with a FLAG epitope in the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen), to give the plasmid FLAG-CRIK-SK. The amino acid substitution K126A was introduced by PCR using the oligonucleotides GACGTCTATGCCATGGCAATCAAGAAGAAG and CTTCTTCTTGATTGCCATGGCATAGACGTC, to give the plasmid FLAG-CRIK-SK-KD>. For expression of full-length CRIK, the coding sequence of mouse CRIK was amplified by PCR from a spleen Marathon-ReadyTMcDNA (CLONTECH) using the same forward oligo as above and a reverse oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 4983–4957 of Citron and including a NotI restriction site. The plasmids FLAG-CRIK and FLAG-CRIK(KD>) were then generated by replacing the BamHI-NotI fragment of FLAG-CRIK-SK and FLAG-CRIK-SK-KD>, respectively, with the correspondingBamHI-NotI derived from the full-length CRIK cDNA. In every case the amplifications were performed using the AdvantageTM KlenTaq polymerase mix (CLONTECH), and the recombinant plasmids were verified by sequencing. Subconfluent COS7 cells in 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method with 10 μg of empty vector or recombinant FLAG-CRIK plasmids. In case of cotransfection experiments, cells were transfected either with 25 μg of empty vector alone, or with a combination of 20 μg of CRIK expression vector plus 5 μg of either empty vector or of an expression vector for the Rho V14 or Rac V12 mutants. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously, and cells were probed with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Eastman Kodak Co.). Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitations of COS7 cells or primary mouse keratinocytes, cultivated in medium at low calcium concentrations (16Calautti E. Sara Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), were performed as described previously (16Calautti E. Sara Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), by overnight incubation at 4 °C with either anti-FLAG (Kodak) or anti-Citron S-20 and C-20 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (16Calautti E. Sara Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) by incubating immune complexes in 50 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), in the presence or absence of 5 mg of histone H1 or myelin basic protein, plus 0.1 mm ATP and 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mm, NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min at 30 °C. The products were analyzed by 5% or 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins, primary keratinocytes were incubated with 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Expre35S; NEN Life Science Products) for 4 h in methionine-free medium in the presence of serum (16Calautti E. Sara Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by autoradiography. Mouse primary keratinocytes plated on collagen-coated glass coverslips were transfected with FLAG-tagged CRIK expression vectors. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldheyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked in 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL). For actin staining, Bodipy 581–591-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was added during the incubation with the secondary antibodies. For labeling of the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, cells were incubated in serum-free medium with Fluorescein-conjugated dextran (10,000 M r, anionic; Molecular Probes) for either 5 or 10 min, prior to paraformaldheide fixation (17Berthiaume E.P. Medina C. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Slides were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a TCS4D scanner (Leica) connected to an inverted LEITZ DM IRB microscope. In order to identify new kinases specifically expressed in mouse primary keratinocytes, a degenerate oligonucleotide-based PCR approach was undertaken to screen a keratinocyte c-DNA library (14Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting amplification products were cloned and sequenced. A BLAST sequence similarity search revealed that one of the clones (KK-1) encoded a new serine/threonine kinase domain. Northern blot analysis showed that the corresponding mRNA is specifically expressed in mouse primary keratinocytes and not dermal fibroblasts, and that KK-1 mRNA levels in cultured keratinocytes were comparable to those in total skin (Fig. 1 A). The nucleotide sequence assembled from a series of overlapping cDNAs (obtained by screening a keratinocyte cDNA library with a KK-1 probe) consists of 2373 base pairs, with a large open reading frame extending from nucleotides 772 to 2253, and coding for a 495-amino acid protein (GenBankTM accession no. AF086824). The predicted amino acid sequence contains a complete serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain that extends from amino acids 96 to 359 (18Ronco L.V. Silverman S.L. Wong S.G. Slamon D.J.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (32% identity) (Fig. 2 A). Outside the highly conserved kinase domain, KK-1 shared a lower but still significant homology with the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (31% identity, 61% homology), and PK428 (27% identity, 49% homology) proteins in their C-terminal region.Figure 2Structure of CRIK and related gene products. Panel A, alignment of the CRIK kinase domain with the sequences of human myotonic dystrophy kinase (DMK, accession no.

Areas of amino acid identity are highlighted in black. Panel B, left, sequence of the junction between the amino-terminal part of the protein, common to both CRIK and CRIK-SK, and the Citron moiety, present only in CRIK. Thearrows point to the site of alternative splicing that produces the full-length form of CRIK. Right, the CRIK/Citron splicing product as assessed by RT-PCR. Total RNA from primary mouse keratinocytes was analyzed by RT-PCR, using an oligonucleotide corresponding to the kinase domain-part of CRIK as common forward primer (KS), and three different oligonucleotides (CS-1, -2, and -3) corresponding to Citron-specific sequences as reverse primers (see “Materials and Methods” for details). The expected molecular size for RT-PCR products with oligonucleotide pairs KS-CS1 (lane 1), KS-CS2 (lane 3), and KS-CS3 (lane 5) were 1,412, 1,872 and 2,833 base pairs, respectively. Negative controls with PCR performed without reverse transcriptase were also included (lanes 2, 4, and 6). The position of molecular size markers is indicated (kb). Panel C, schematic representation of the three possible products of the CRIK gene. Indicated are the KD, the coiled coil region (Coiled-coil), the Rho/Rac binding domain (RRB), the zinc finger region (ZF), the plekstrin homology domain (PH), the proline-rich, putative SH3 binding domain (Pro).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The overlapping KK-1 cDNA clones obtained in our initial screening corresponded to ∼2.2 kb of sequence, which is substantially less than the entire length of the major transcript detected by Northern blotting (∼9.5 kb) (Fig. 1). Additional bands of smaller size were also evident on the KK-1 RNA blots after prolonged exposures. This raised the possibility that the transcripts coding for the KK-1 kinase may exist in multiple forms, as a result of differential splicing and/or alternative polyadenylation. For this reason, we decided to expand our KK-1 cDNA cloning using RACE-PCR, with a set of nested oligonucleotides extending toward either the 5′ or 3′ direction. Myotonic dystrophy-related kinases can be subdivided into two subfamilies, depending on whether the catalytic domain is located at the amino-terminal (as in myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, ROCK, PK428) or carboxyl-terminal (as in Drosophila warts) part of the protein (20Mahadevan M.S.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 534-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The 5′-directed RACE-PCR of KK-1 transcripts did not result in any significant extension of the coding sequence. In contrast, sequencing of clones obtained by 3′-directed RACE-PCR, revealed the existence of an alternative coding sequence beyond position 2169, corresponding to codon 466 of KK-1 (Fig. 2 B). The sequence 3′ of that point extended for an additional 4770 nucleotides of open reading frames, and was found to be identical to that of the Rho/Rac interacting protein Citron (10Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A possible site of alternative splicing at codon position +8 of Citron was noted (10Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing at this position is now supported by our 3′-RACE-PCR experiments, which produced cDNAs with an in frame fusion of the KK-1 coding region to codon +9 of Citron (Fig. 2 B). To confirm the existence of these KK-1/Citron transcripts, total RNA from primary keratinocytes was directly analyzed by RT-PCR, using a common oligonucleotide corresponding to bases 1807–1832 of KK-1 as a forward primer, and a set of nucleotides at different positions of Citron as reverse primers. Products of the expected molecular weight were generated in all cases (Fig. 2 B, right panel), which were cloned and found to have the predicted nucleotide sequence (not shown). Using this approach, the existence of transcripts coding for the short form of this kinase was also confirmed (not shown). Henceforth, we will refer to the full-length KK-1/Citron product as CRIK, and to its short kinase form as CRIK-SK. In keeping with the literature, we will still use the name of Citron for the already reported form, devoid of kinase domain. To examine whether the different CRIK/Citron isoforms exhibit a similar pattern of expression, Northern blots from different mouse tissues were sequentially hybridized with a probe corresponding to the catalytic kinase domain, found in CRIK and CRIK-SK but not Citron, and with a second probe within the coiled-coil region of Citron, found in CRIK and Citron but not in CRIK-SK. As in primary keratinocytes and skin, a major 9.5-kb mRNA band was found to hybridize with the kinase domain probe in brain, spleen, lung, kidney, and, as an especially strong signal, in testis (Fig. 1 B, left panel). A second ∼7-kb band was also detectable in the testis and, after longer exposures, in spleen, kidney, and brain (not shown). No expression was detectable in heart, liver, and skeletal muscle. When the same blot was rehybridized with the Citron probe, the two 9.5- and 7-kb bands were also detected, which showed a similar but not identical hybridization pattern as with the kinase domain probe (Fig. 1 B, right panel). In particular, the RNA derived from testis again yielded the strongest signal, but the relative signal intensity of the 9.5- versus 7-kb bands was reversed with the Citronversus kinase domain probe. Similarly, in brain RNA, the signal intensity of the 9.5-kb band was much stronger with the Citron probe and, in testis and spleen, two weaker bands of approximately 5.5 and 4.4 kb, respectively, were detected only with this probe (Fig. 1 B). To demonstrate that the CRIK gene encodes functional kinases, full-length cDNAs for both CRIK and CRIK-SK were fused to an amino-terminal FLAG epitope and cloned into a cytomegaloviurs mammalian expression vector. Mutant forms of these cDNAs were also constructed, with a lysine to alanine (K/A) substitution at position 126, in the predicted ATP binding pocket (18Ronco L.V. Silverman S.L. Wong S.G. Slamon D.J. Park L.S. Gasson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 277-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations were expected to generate CRIK and CRIK-SK forms devoid of kinase activity. Total cell extracts were prepared from COS7 cells transfected with the various expression plasmids, and immunoprecipitated with anti FLAG antibodies. An in vitrokinase assay was then performed with histone H1 as exogenous substrate. Elevated kinase activity toward histone H1 was found in cells transfected with the expression constructs for wild type forms of both CRIK and CRIK-SK (Fig. 3 A). Myelin basic protein also functioned as an efficient substrate (not shown). In addition to exogenous substrates, two in vitrophosphorylated proteins of the expected molecular weight for CRIK and CRIK-SK were found in the respective immunoprecipitates, consistent with the two proteins being capable of autophosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, none of these in vitro kinase activities was found in cells transfected with the mutants of CRIK and CRIK-SK harboring the Lys to Ala (K126A) substitution. Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibodies indicated that the wild type and mutated forms were expressed at similar levels in the transfected cells (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). Activity of the ROCK kinase has been shown to be increased a few folds by coexpression of an activated form of Rho (6Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Similarly, cotransfection of cells with expression vectors for CRIK and Rho(V14) resulted in an 8-fold stimulation of CRIK kinase activity, while coexpression of activated Rac (Rac(V12)) led only to a 1.5-fold stimulation (Fig. 3 E). Two different polyclonal antibodies, raised against peptides corresponding to amino acids 1547–1576 (S-20) and 1578–1597 (C-20) of the previously published Citron sequence were found to immunoprecipitate the exogenously expressed full-length form of CRIK (Fig. 3 B). Untransfected primary keratinocytes were immunoprecipitated with these antibodies, to test whether an endogenous kinase activity amenable to CRIK could be recovered. In vitro kinase activity with myelin basic protein as an exogenous substrate was found in the immunoprecipitates with these antibodies, and recovery of this activity was effectively competed in immunoprecipitates performed in the presence of blocking peptides (Fig. 3 C). Immunoprecipitation experiments with35S-labeled keratinocytes revealed that two endogenous proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated by the C-20 antibodies, with molecular weights consistent with those of CRIK and Citron (Fig. 3 D). Interestingly, the other antibodies immunoprecipitated only the larger of these proteins, which is likely to correspond to CRIK, both on the basis of size and on the similar recovery of kinase activity in the C-20 and S-20 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3, Cand D). Under our conditions, immunoblotting with the C-20 and S-20 antibodies generated no detectable bands above background, thus preventing further analysis with this technique. In parallel with their different structure, CRIK and CRIK-SK may differ significantly in their intracellular localization and/or their effects on the actin cytoskeleton. This possibility was investigated by transfecting keratinocytes with epitope tagged forms of CRIK or CRIK-SK, followed by double immunofluorescence with epitope-specific antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondaries (green), and BODIPY-conjugated phalloidin (red). Growing keratinocytes in medium at low calcium concentrations (0.05 mm) have a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio that hampers detailed analysis of their cytoplasmic organization. For this reason, cells were analyzed 24 h after growth in extracellular calcium (2 mm), which causes flattening of cell morphology, with a well ordered disposition of the actin cytoskeleton. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, full-length CRIK showed a discrete pattern of intracellular localization, into dotted cytoplasmic structures to which F-actin was also recruited. Interestingly, this corpuscolar pattern of intracellular organization was maintained by the kinase-dead mutant form of CRIK, while colocalization of actin in these structures was reduced or absent (Fig. 4, C and D). Expression of an activated Rho protein in keratinocytes did not induce the changes caused by full-length CRIK, nor additional effects were observed by overexpression of the two proteins (not shown). In contrast to full-length CRIK, CRIK-SK showed diffuse localization throughout the cytoplasm, and had little if any effect on the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 4, E and F). Additional experiments were performed where keratinocytes were transfected with an expression vector for the epitope-tagged full-length form of CRIK and loaded with fluorescein-conjugated dextran prior to fixation. Immunofluorescence analysis with antiepitope antibodies and Texas Red-conjugated secondaries indicated that the discrete subcellular localization of CRICK does not coincide with the endosomal compartment as detected by the fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran-labeling technique (17Berthiaume E.P. Medina C. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Among the downstream effectors of Rho function, ROCK proteins are probably the best characterized (5Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 6Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The activated form of Rho appears to directly associate with ROCK. Consequently, the ROCK kinase is moderately activated (6Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) and translocates to peripheral membranes where it may interact with some of its substrates (8Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M.

Citron was reported to share many of the structural features of ROCK, including a domain mediating direct association with Rho (10Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, no biochemical activity was attributed to Citron. We have shown here the existence of a new Ser/Thr kinase, CRIK, which can be expressed in at least two forms, one of which encompasses the previously reported form of Citron in almost its entirety. Besides cDNA cloning, RT-PCR and Northern data indicate that CRIK and Citron are part of the same gene. This conclusion is further supported by our cloning of the human homologue of the CRIK kinase domain, and the finding that it maps to chromosome 12q24 1-3, 2F. Di Cunto, E. Calautti, J. Hsiao, L. Ong, G. Topley, E. Turco, and G. P. Dotto, unpublished results. which is in excellent agreement with the map position of the human homologue of Citron (Homo sapiens PAC clone 127H14, GenBankTM accession no. AC002563). Like ROCK (6Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), CRIK kinase activity was found to be increased a few folds by coexpression of an activated form of Rho. Interestingly, activated Rac had little or no effect, pointing to a more specific involvement of Rho in control of CRIK activity. The ROCK kinases are ubiquitously expressed (22Nakagawa O. Fujisawa K. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Nakao K. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). By contrast, CRIK expression exhibits a striking pattern of cell type specificity, suggesting that this kinase may serve as a downstream mediator of Rho function in these cells. In keratinocytes, full-length CRIK was found to localize into corpuscular structures which do not correspond to the endosomal compartment, and whose identity remains to be established. Actin was recruited into these structures in a manner that was dependent on CRIK activity, as such recruitment was not observed after expression of a kinase dead form of CRIK. Actin recruitment was not further increased by activated Rho expression, indicating that the basal level of CRIK activity in cells overexpressing this kinase is by itself sufficient for this effect. The subcellular localization of full-length CRIK is likely to depend on one or more of the multiple domains present in the Citron moiety of the protein, as it was not observed with the CRIK-SK isoform, containing only the kinase region. Future studies will have to dissect the function of CRIK and its multiple isoforms in the specific cell types where these molecules are normally expressed. We thank Drs. Jeff Settleman and Cathrin Brisken for critical reading of the manuscript, and Dr. Sylvie Vincent for helpful suggestions."

Various bacterial exotoxins ADP-ribosylate eukaryotic proteins. These proteins are essential for signal transduction or cellular structure. With respect to their protein substrates, these toxins can be classified into at least four groups: (i) elongation factor 2 ADP-ribosylating toxins (e.g. diphtheria toxin) (1Wilson B.A. Collier R.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 27-42PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) heterotrimeric G-protein ADP-ribosylating toxins (e.g.cholera and pertussis toxin) (2Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Herken H. Hucho F. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer, Heidelberg1992: 807-839Google Scholar); (iii) toxins (e.g. Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme) that ADP-ribosylate small GTPases (3Aktories K. Mohr C. Koch G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 115-131PubMed Google Scholar); and (iv) ADP-ribosyltransferases with actin as a substrate (4Aktories K. Wegner A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The fourth group includes the clostridial ADP-ribosyltransferases C. botulinum C2 toxin (5Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), Clostrium perfringens iota toxin (6Simpson L.L. Stiles B.G. Zapeda H.H. Wilkins T.D. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 118-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Clostridium spiroforme toxins (7Popoff M.R. Boquet P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and an ADP-ribosyltransferase fromClostridium difficile (8Perelle S. Gibert M. bourlioux P. Corthier G. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The binary C. botulinum C21 toxin is composed of the binding component C2II (M r ∼100,000) and the enzymatic component C2I (M r ∼49,000). Both components are separate proteins and are neither covalently nor noncovalently linked (9Ohishi I. Iwasaki M. Sakaguchi G. Infect. Immun. 1980; 30: 668-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To elicit toxic effects, the trypsin-activated C2II (M r ∼80,000) binds to the cell surface and forms a binding site for C2I (10Ohishi I. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The toxin enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis (11Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 1223-1228PubMed Google Scholar) followed by translocation of C2I into the cytosol. In the cell, the enzyme component ADP-ribosylates G-actin at arginine 177 (5Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 12Vandekerckhove J. Schering B. Bärmann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 696-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrates of C2 toxin are β/γ-non-muscle actin and γ-smooth muscle actin, but not α-actin isoforms. In contrast to C2 toxin, the related iota toxin ADP-ribosylates all actin isoforms (13Mauss S. Chaponnier C. Just I. Aktories K. Gabbiani G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation inhibits actin polymerization and blocks the actin ATPase activity (5Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 14Geipel U. Just I. Schering B. Haas D. Aktories K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, ADP-ribosylation turns G-actin into a capping protein that binds to the fast-growing (barbed) ends of F-actin, which inhibits polymerization of nonmodified actin at these ends (15Wegner A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13739-13742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, ADP-ribosylation of actin blocks the nucleation activity of the gelsolin-actin complex (16Wille M. Just I. Wegner A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 50-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In intact cells, C2 toxin causes complete depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton and eventually cell death (17Reuner K.H. Presek P. Boschek C.B. Aktories K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 134-140PubMed Google Scholar).Despite a rather poor amino acid sequence homology between the various bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases, recent crystallographic data revealed a very similar tertiary structure between Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (18Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), diphtheria toxin (19Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fujii G. Curmi P.M.G.

Klein M.H. Read R.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The NAD-binding and catalytic site, which is formed by two antiparallel β-sheets flanked by two α-helices, appears to be highly conserved among all these ADP-ribosylating toxins. The crystallographic analyses corroborated earlier biochemical findings that indicated a highly conserved glutamic acid residue as the essential part of the transferase active site (22Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3307-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Jung M. Just I. van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23215-23218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a second glutamic acid residue, located two residues upstream of the “catalytic” glutamate residue is conserved in many ADP-ribosyltransferases. It has been suggested that this glutamic acid residue is also important for the transferase reaction (24Domenighini M. Magagnoli C. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Domenighini M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Takada T. Iida K. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 541-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, most toxins (with the exception of group (i) toxins), share a common arginine residue about 50–120 amino acids upstream of the glutamate region and a highly conserved serine-threonine-serine (STS) motif between these two regions (26Takada T. Iida K. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 541-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Recently, the sequence of the structural gene of the enzyme component of C. botulinum C2 toxin was reported (27Fujii N. Kubota T. Shirakawa S. Kimura K. Ohishi I. Moriishi K. Isogai E. Isogai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To compare functionally important domains of C2I with those of other transferases including iota toxin, we analyzed the structure-function relationship of the enzyme component of C2 toxin by site-directed mutagenesis. Here, we report that in addition to the conserved active site glutamic acid residue Glu389, a second glutamic acid residue Glu387 is essential for transferase activity but not for NAD-glycohydrolase activity of C2I. Moreover, the conserved STS motif and the arginine residue most likely involved in NAD-binding of C2I are identified as residues Ser348–Thr349–Ser350 and Arg299, respectively.DISCUSSIONRecently, the structural gene of the enzyme component of C. botulinum C2 toxin, C2I, was cloned and sequenced (27Fujii N. Kubota T. Shirakawa S. Kimura K. Ohishi I. Moriishi K. Isogai E. Isogai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although no significant sequence identity with any other transferase was reported, we detected about 33% sequence identity of C2I with the enzyme component of iota toxin (program: PCGENE, V 6.85, 1995). After alignment of C2I with iota toxin and with various other ADP-ribosyltransferases, we assumed that the glutamic acid residue in position 389 of C2I plays a similar pivotal role for catalysis of the ADP-ribosylation reaction as Glu380 of iota toxin (30Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we report that the exchange of Glu389 of C2I to glutamine blocked the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity as well as the NAD-glycohydrolase activity and prevented the cytotoxic effects of this toxin. These findings are in line with the notion that Glu389 of C2I is the catalytic glutamic acid residue that is highly conserved within the family of ADP-ribosyltransferases. Thus, Glu389 of C2I appears to be functionally equivalent with Glu148 of diphtheria toxin (22Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3307-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), Glu554 of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (31Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23215-23218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Böhmer J. Jung M. Sehr P. Fritz G. Popoff M. Just I. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1).All ADP-ribosyltransferases that modify arginine residues including cholera toxin, the heat-labile E. coli enterotoxins, iota toxin, and C2 toxin contain a second glutamate residue two residues upstream of the invariant “catalytic” glutamic acid residue (34Koch-Nolte F.

The same holds true for some recently described eukaryotic arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases (34Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F. Kahlke D. Willer T. Kastelein R. Bazan F. Thiele H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7686-7693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Okazaki I.J. Moss J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The exchange of this second glutamic acid residue (Glu387) to glutamine in C2I resulted in a loss of transferase activity. This finding is in agreement with recent studies on the heat-labile E. colitoxin (36Lobet Y. Cluff C. Cieplak J.W. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2870-2879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), iota toxin (30Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and rabbit muscle ADP-ribosyltransferase (34Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F. Kahlke D. Willer T. Kastelein R. Bazan F. Thiele H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7686-7693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In all of these cases, the exchange of the second preceding glutamic acid residue inhibited the transferase activity. Surprisingly, the E387Q mutant of C2I still hydrolyzed NAD, indicating that this residue is essential for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity but is not required for NAD-glycohydrolase activity. In this respect, recent studies on rodent T-cell RT6 antigens, which are related to arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases, are noteworthy (34Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F.

RT6.1, which contains the highly conserved “catalytic” glutamic acid residue at position 209 and glutamine at position 207, demonstrates NAD-glycohydrolase activity but not transferase activity.

In contrast, the RT6 mouse homologue Rt6-1, which is characterized by an intrinsic Glu207, possesses ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (39Moss J. Stevens L.A. Cavanaugh E. Okazaki I.J. Bortell R.

Exchange of Glu207 of Rt6-1 to glutamine inhibits the arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (37Hara N. Tsuchiya M. Shimoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29552-29555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).We performed photoaffinity labeling of the single mutants E387Q and E389Q, and of the double mutant E387Q/E389Q of C2I toxin. While the double mutant was not labeled with [carbonyl-14C]NAD, both single mutants were radiolabeled. It has been shown with diphtheria toxin that UV irradiation cross-links NAD to the γ-methylene carbone formed by decarboxylation of the catalytic glutamic acid residue (40Carroll S.F. McCloskey J.A. Crain P.F. Oppenheimer N.J. Marschner T.M. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7237-7241Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We suggest that both glutamic acid residues (Glu387 and Glu389) of C2I toxin serve as targets for UV-induced cross-linking of NAD. Thus, both glutamic acid residues seem to be located in or near the NAD-binding cleft. In line with this notion is the report on the photoaffinity labeling of iota toxin, which is also characterized by the EXE motif (Glu378–Tyr–Glu380) at the catalytic site with Glu380 being the conserved catalytic glutamic acid residue (41van Damme J. Jung M. Hofmann F. Just I. Vandekerckhove J. Aktories K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, UV-irradiation of iota toxin with [14C]NAD resulted in labeling of Glu378. Moreover, recent analysis of the crystal structure of diphtheria toxin bound to NAD and subsequent structural alignments of other ADP-ribosyltransferases suggest a close positioning of the preceding Gln/Glu residue to the nucleotide (42Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).Many mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (e.g. pertussis toxin and E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin) share a common STS motif about 20–70 amino acid residues upstream of the above mentioned glutamate residues (25Domenighini M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This motif is suggested to bind to either the ribose or the phosphate of the AMP moiety of NAD (42Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In C2I, the STS motif is extended to SSTS (Ser347 through Ser350). Exchange of the first (Ser347) or the last (Ser350) serine residues of this sequence to alanine, did not change transferase activity substantially. Similarly, the exchange of both Ser347 and Ser350 to alanine reduced but did not eliminate transferase activity. These findings support the notion that neither serine residue Ser347 or Ser350 is essential for catalysis. Whereas exchange of Thr349 with valine reduced the enzyme activity, the exchange of Ser348 to alanine eliminated transferase activity. Thus, Ser348 may play an essential role in NAD-binding or catalysis. In pertussis toxin and E. coliheat-labile enterotoxin, the first serine residue of the STS motif overlaps with Tyr54 of diphtheria toxin and most likely participates in formation of a groove in which the nicotinamide ring and NMN ribose of NAD fit (42Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).An important role in transferase activity are ascribed to the arginine residues at positions 9 and 7 of pertussis toxin (43Pizza M. Bartoloni A. Prugnola A. Silvestri S. Rappuoli R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and E. coli heat-labile toxin (36Lobet Y. Cluff C. Cieplak J.W. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2870-2879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. These arginine residues overlap exactly with His21 of diphtheria toxin, an amino acid residue, which is essential for transferase activity although it may not directly be involved in catalysis (44Johnson V.G. Nicholls P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deductions from crystal analysis (20Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. Wartna E.S. van Zanten B.A.M. Witholt B. Hol W.G.J. Nature. 1991; 351: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 42Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have suggested that these arginine/histidine residues are essential for NAD-binding and/or maintenance of the active-site integrity of the ADP-ribosyltransferases. We tested whether Arg299 or Arg300 plays a similar crucial role in C2I toxin activity. Only the exchange of Arg299 to alanine induced a dramatic reduction in transferase activity. Therefore we propose that the arginine at position 299 is equivalent to Arg7 of E. coli heat-labile toxin and Arg9 of pertussis toxin. Moreover, our findings are in full agreement with recent site-directed mutagenesis of iota toxin showing that only Arg295, and not Arg296, is essential for transferase activity (30Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).In summary, we demonstrate that Glu389 represents the highly conserved catalytic glutamic acid residue, and Glu387 is essential for transferase but not for NAD-glycohydrolase activity. Furthermore, we identify that Ser348 is essential for transferase activity. Finally, our studies suggest that Arg299 of C2I toxin and not Arg300 is the conserved arginine residue which is most likely involved in NAD binding and/or stabilization of the active site structure. Various bacterial exotoxins ADP-ribosylate eukaryotic proteins. These proteins are essential for signal transduction or cellular structure. With respect to their protein substrates, these toxins can be classified into at least four groups: (i) elongation factor 2 ADP-ribosylating toxins (e.g. diphtheria toxin) (1Wilson B.A. Collier R.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 27-42PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) heterotrimeric G-protein ADP-ribosylating toxins (e.g.cholera and pertussis toxin) (2Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Herken H. Hucho F. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer, Heidelberg1992: 807-839Google Scholar); (iii) toxins (e.g. Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme) that ADP-ribosylate small GTPases (3Aktories K. Mohr C. Koch G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 115-131PubMed Google Scholar); and (iv) ADP-ribosyltransferases with actin as a substrate (4Aktories K. Wegner A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The fourth group includes the clostridial ADP-ribosyltransferases C. botulinum C2 toxin (5Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), Clostrium perfringens iota toxin (6Simpson L.L. Stiles B.G. Zapeda H.H. Wilkins T.D. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 118-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Clostridium spiroforme toxins (7Popoff M.R. Boquet P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and an ADP-ribosyltransferase fromClostridium difficile (8Perelle S. Gibert M. bourlioux P. Corthier G. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binary C. botulinum C21 toxin is composed of the binding component C2II (M r ∼100,000) and the enzymatic component C2I (M r ∼49,000). Both components are separate proteins and are neither covalently nor noncovalently linked (9Ohishi I. Iwasaki M. Sakaguchi G. Infect. Immun. 1980; 30: 668-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To elicit toxic effects, the trypsin-activated C2II (M r ∼80,000) binds to the cell surface and forms a binding site for C2I (10Ohishi I. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The toxin enters the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis (11Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 1223-1228PubMed Google Scholar) followed by translocation of C2I into the cytosol. In the cell, the enzyme component ADP-ribosylates G-actin at arginine 177 (5Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 12Vandekerckhove J. Schering B. Bärmann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 696-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrates of C2 toxin are β/γ-non-muscle actin and γ-smooth muscle actin, but not α-actin isoforms. In contrast to C2 toxin, the related iota toxin ADP-ribosylates all actin isoforms (13Mauss S. Chaponnier C. Just I. Aktories K. Gabbiani G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation inhibits actin polymerization and blocks the actin ATPase activity (5Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 14Geipel U. Just I. Schering B. Haas D. Aktories K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, ADP-ribosylation turns G-actin into a capping protein that binds to the fast-growing (barbed) ends of F-actin, which inhibits polymerization of nonmodified actin at these ends (15Wegner A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13739-13742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, ADP-ribosylation of actin blocks the nucleation activity of the gelsolin-actin complex (16Wille M. Just I. Wegner A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 50-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In intact cells, C2 toxin causes complete depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton and eventually cell death (17Reuner K.H. Presek P. Boschek C.B. Aktories K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 134-140PubMed Google Scholar). Despite a rather poor amino acid sequence homology between the various bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases, recent crystallographic data revealed a very similar tertiary structure between Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (18Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Pastan I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6902-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), diphtheria toxin (19Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fujii G. Curmi P.M.G. Kantardjieff K.A. Collier R.J. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 357: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar),Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (20Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. Wartna E.S. van Zanten B.A.M. Witholt B. Hol W.G.J. Nature. 1991; 351: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), and pertussis toxin (21Stein P.E. Boodhoo A. Armstrong G.D. Cockle S.A. Klein M.H. Read R.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The NAD-binding and catalytic site, which is formed by two antiparallel β-sheets flanked by two α-helices, appears to be highly conserved among all these ADP-ribosylating toxins. The crystallographic analyses corroborated earlier biochemical findings that indicated a highly conserved glutamic acid residue as the essential part of the transferase active site (22Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3307-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Jung M. Just I. van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23215-23218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a second glutamic acid residue, located two residues upstream of the “catalytic” glutamate residue is conserved in many ADP-ribosyltransferases. It has been suggested that this glutamic acid residue is also important for the transferase reaction (24Domenighini M. Magagnoli C. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Domenighini M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Takada T. Iida K. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 541-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, most toxins (with the exception of group (i) toxins), share a common arginine residue about 50–120 amino acids upstream of the glutamate region and a highly conserved serine-threonine-serine (STS) motif between these two regions (26Takada T. Iida K. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 541-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently, the sequence of the structural gene of the enzyme component of C. botulinum C2 toxin was reported (27Fujii N. Kubota T. Shirakawa S. Kimura K. Ohishi I. Moriishi K. Isogai E. Isogai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To compare functionally important domains of C2I with those of other transferases including iota toxin, we analyzed the structure-function relationship of the enzyme component of C2 toxin by site-directed mutagenesis. Here, we report that in addition to the conserved active site glutamic acid residue Glu389, a second glutamic acid residue Glu387 is essential for transferase activity but not for NAD-glycohydrolase activity of C2I. Moreover, the conserved STS motif and the arginine residue most likely involved in NAD-binding of C2I are identified as residues Ser348–Thr349–Ser350 and Arg299, respectively. DISCUSSIONRecently, the structural gene of the enzyme component of C. botulinum C2 toxin, C2I, was cloned and sequenced (27Fujii N. Kubota T. Shirakawa S. Kimura K. Ohishi I. Moriishi K. Isogai E. Isogai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although no significant sequence identity with any other transferase was reported, we detected about 33% sequence identity of C2I with the enzyme component of iota toxin (program: PCGENE, V 6.85, 1995). After alignment of C2I with iota toxin and with various other ADP-ribosyltransferases, we assumed that the glutamic acid residue in position 389 of C2I plays a similar pivotal role for catalysis of the ADP-ribosylation reaction as Glu380 of iota toxin (30Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we report that the exchange of Glu389 of C2I to glutamine blocked the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity as well as the NAD-glycohydrolase activity and prevented the cytotoxic effects of this toxin. These findings are in line with the notion that Glu389 of C2I is the catalytic glutamic acid residue that is highly conserved within the family of ADP-ribosyltransferases. Thus, Glu389 of C2I appears to be functionally equivalent with Glu148 of diphtheria toxin (22Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3307-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), Glu554 of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (31Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8707-8711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Glu112 of E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin (20Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. Wartna E.S. van Zanten B.A.M. Witholt B. Hol W.G.J. Nature. 1991; 351: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), Glu129 of pertussis toxin (32Barbieri J.T. Mende-Mueller M. Rappuoli R. Collier R.J. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3549-3554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Glu174 of C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase (23Jung M. Just I. van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23215-23218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Böhmer J. Jung M. Sehr P. Fritz G. Popoff M. Just I. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1).All ADP-ribosyltransferases that modify arginine residues including cholera toxin, the heat-labile E. coli enterotoxins, iota toxin, and C2 toxin contain a second glutamate residue two residues upstream of the invariant “catalytic” glutamic acid residue (34Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F. Kahlke D. Willer T. Kastelein R. Bazan F. Thiele H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7686-7693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The same holds true for some recently described eukaryotic arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases (34Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F. Kahlke D. Willer T. Kastelein R. Bazan F. Thiele H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7686-7693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Okazaki I.J. Moss J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The exchange of this second glutamic acid residue (Glu387) to glutamine in C2I resulted in a loss of transferase activity. This finding is in agreement with recent studies on the heat-labile E. colitoxin (36Lobet Y. Cluff C. Cieplak J.W. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2870-2879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), iota toxin (30Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and rabbit muscle ADP-ribosyltransferase (34Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F. Kahlke D. Willer T. Kastelein R. Bazan F. Thiele H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7686-7693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In all of these cases, the exchange of the second preceding glutamic acid residue inhibited the transferase activity. Surprisingly, the E387Q mutant of C2I still hydrolyzed NAD, indicating that this residue is essential for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity but is not required for NAD-glycohydrolase activity. In this respect, recent studies on rodent T-cell RT6 antigens, which are related to arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases, are noteworthy (34Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F.

Today. 1996; 17: 402-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). RT6.1, which contains the highly conserved “catalytic” glutamic acid residue at position 209 and glutamine at position 207, demonstrates NAD-glycohydrolase activity but not transferase activity. Exchange of Gln207 of RT6.1 with glutamic acid resulted in expression of transferase activity of RT6.1 (37Hara N. Tsuchiya M. Shimoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29552-29555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, the RT6 mouse homologue Rt6-1, which is characterized by an intrinsic Glu207, possesses ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (39Moss J. Stevens L.A. Cavanaugh E. Okazaki I.J. Bortell R.

While the double mutant was not labeled with [carbonyl-14C]NAD, both single mutants were radiolabeled. It has been shown with diphtheria toxin that UV irradiation cross-links NAD to the γ-methylene carbone formed by decarboxylation of the catalytic glutamic acid residue (40Carroll S.F. McCloskey J.A.

Although no significant sequence identity with any other transferase was reported, we detected about 33% sequence identity of C2I with the enzyme component of iota toxin (program: PCGENE, V 6.85, 1995). After alignment of C2I with iota toxin and with various other ADP-ribosyltransferases, we assumed that the glutamic acid residue in position 389 of C2I plays a similar pivotal role for catalysis of the ADP-ribosylation reaction as Glu380 of iota toxin (30Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we report that the exchange of Glu389 of C2I to glutamine blocked the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity as well as the NAD-glycohydrolase activity and prevented the cytotoxic effects of this toxin. These findings are in line with the notion that Glu389 of C2I is the catalytic glutamic acid residue that is highly conserved within the family of ADP-ribosyltransferases. Thus, Glu389 of C2I appears to be functionally equivalent with Glu148 of diphtheria toxin (22Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3307-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), Glu554 of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (31Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8707-8711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Glu112 of E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin (20Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. Wartna E.S. van Zanten B.A.M. Witholt B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23215-23218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Böhmer J. Jung M. Sehr P. Fritz G. Popoff M. Just I. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). All ADP-ribosyltransferases that modify arginine residues including cholera toxin, the heat-labile E. coli enterotoxins, iota toxin, and C2 toxin contain a second glutamate residue two residues upstream of the invariant “catalytic” glutamic acid residue (34Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F. Kahlke D. Willer T. Kastelein R. Bazan F. Thiele H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7686-7693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The same holds true for some recently described eukaryotic arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases (34Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F. Kahlke D. Willer T. Kastelein R. Bazan F. Thiele H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7686-7693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Okazaki I.J. Moss J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The exchange of this second glutamic acid residue (Glu387) to glutamine in C2I resulted in a loss of transferase activity. This finding is in agreement with recent studies on the heat-labile E. colitoxin (36Lobet Y. Cluff C. Cieplak J.W. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2870-2879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), iota toxin (30Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and rabbit muscle ADP-ribosyltransferase (34Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F. Kahlke D. Willer T. Kastelein R. Bazan F. Thiele H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7686-7693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In all of these cases, the exchange of the second preceding glutamic acid residue inhibited the transferase activity. Surprisingly, the E387Q mutant of C2I still hydrolyzed NAD, indicating that this residue is essential for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity but is not required for NAD-glycohydrolase activity. In this respect, recent studies on rodent T-cell RT6 antigens, which are related to arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases, are noteworthy (34Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F.

Today. 1996; 17: 402-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). RT6.1, which contains the highly conserved “catalytic” glutamic acid residue at position 209 and glutamine at position 207, demonstrates NAD-glycohydrolase activity but not transferase activity. Exchange of Gln207 of RT6.1 with glutamic acid resulted in expression of transferase activity of RT6.1 (37Hara N. Tsuchiya M. Shimoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29552-29555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, the RT6 mouse homologue Rt6-1, which is characterized by an intrinsic Glu207, possesses ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (39Moss J. Stevens L.A. Cavanaugh E. Okazaki I.J. Bortell R. Kanaitsuka T. Mordes J.P. Greiner D.L. Rossini A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4342-4346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Exchange of Glu207 of Rt6-1 to glutamine inhibits the arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (37Hara N. Tsuchiya M. Shimoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29552-29555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We performed photoaffinity labeling of the single mutants E387Q and E389Q, and of the double mutant E387Q/E389Q of C2I toxin. While the double mutant was not labeled with [carbonyl-14C]NAD, both single mutants were radiolabeled. It has been shown with diphtheria toxin that UV irradiation cross-links NAD to the γ-methylene carbone formed by decarboxylation of the catalytic glutamic acid residue (40Carroll S.F. McCloskey J.A. Crain P.F. Oppenheimer N.J. Marschner T.M. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7237-7241Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We suggest that both glutamic acid residues (Glu387 and Glu389) of C2I toxin serve as targets for UV-induced cross-linking of NAD. Thus, both glutamic acid residues seem to be located in or near the NAD-binding cleft. In line with this notion is the report on the photoaffinity labeling of iota toxin, which is also characterized by the EXE motif (Glu378–Tyr–Glu380) at the catalytic site with Glu380 being the conserved catalytic glutamic acid residue (41van Damme J. Jung M. Hofmann F. Just I. Vandekerckhove J. Aktories K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, UV-irradiation of iota toxin with [14C]NAD resulted in labeling of Glu378. Moreover, recent analysis of the crystal structure of diphtheria toxin bound to NAD and subsequent structural alignments of other ADP-ribosyltransferases suggest a close positioning of the preceding Gln/Glu residue to the nucleotide (42Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Many mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (e.g. pertussis toxin and E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin) share a common STS motif about 20–70 amino acid residues upstream of the above mentioned glutamate residues (25Domenighini M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This motif is suggested to bind to either the ribose or the phosphate of the AMP moiety of NAD (42Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In C2I, the STS motif is extended to SSTS (Ser347 through Ser350). Exchange of the first (Ser347) or the last (Ser350) serine residues of this sequence to alanine, did not change transferase activity substantially. Similarly, the exchange of both Ser347 and Ser350 to alanine reduced but did not eliminate transferase activity. These findings support the notion that neither serine residue Ser347 or Ser350 is essential for catalysis. Whereas exchange of Thr349 with valine reduced the enzyme activity, the exchange of Ser348 to alanine eliminated transferase activity. Thus, Ser348 may play an essential role in NAD-binding or catalysis. In pertussis toxin and E. coliheat-labile enterotoxin, the first serine residue of the STS motif overlaps with Tyr54 of diphtheria toxin and most likely participates in formation of a groove in which the nicotinamide ring and NMN ribose of NAD fit (42Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). An important role in transferase activity are ascribed to the arginine residues at positions 9 and 7 of pertussis toxin (43Pizza M. Bartoloni A. Prugnola A. Silvestri S. Rappuoli R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and E. coli heat-labile toxin (36Lobet Y. Cluff C. Cieplak J.W. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2870-2879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. These arginine residues overlap exactly with His21 of diphtheria toxin, an amino acid residue, which is essential for transferase activity although it may not directly be involved in catalysis (44Johnson V.G. Nicholls P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deductions from crystal analysis (20Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. Wartna E.S. van Zanten B.A.M. Witholt B. Hol W.G.J. Nature. 1991; 351: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 42Bell C.E. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have suggested that these arginine/histidine residues are essential for NAD-binding and/or maintenance of the active-site integrity of the ADP-ribosyltransferases. We tested whether Arg299 or Arg300 plays a similar crucial role in C2I toxin activity. Only the exchange of Arg299 to alanine induced a dramatic reduction in transferase activity. Therefore we propose that the arginine at position 299 is equivalent to Arg7 of E. coli heat-labile toxin and Arg9 of pertussis toxin. Moreover, our findings are in full agreement with recent site-directed mutagenesis of iota toxin showing that only Arg295, and not Arg296, is essential for transferase activity (30Perelle S. Domenighini M. Popoff M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In summary, we demonstrate that Glu389 represents the highly conserved catalytic glutamic acid residue, and Glu387 is essential for transferase but not for NAD-glycohydrolase activity. Furthermore, we identify that Ser348 is essential for transferase activity. Finally, our studies suggest that Arg299 of C2I toxin and not Arg300 is the conserved arginine residue which is most likely involved in NAD binding and/or stabilization of the active site structure.

https://openalex.org/W2040062051,"It is well established that an independent inositide cycle is present within the nucleus, where it is involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Previous results have shown that when Swiss 3T3 cells are treated with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) a rapid and sustained increase in mass of diacylglycerol (DAG) occurs within the nuclei, accompanied by a decrease in the levels of both phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. However, it is unclear whether or not other lipids could contribute to this prolonged rise in DAG levels.

Upon stimulation by more than one hundred signaling molecules, the hydrolysis of a minor membrane phospholipid, PIP21 by a specific PI-PLC rapidly occurs (1Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). PIP2 breakdown leads to the generation of two well characterized second messengers: IP3, which is responsible for the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (2Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar), and DAG, which activates some PKC isoforms (3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar). However, DAG can also derive from PC, through the action of PLC or PLD (4Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar). In fact, PLC is reactive with selective PC to produce DAG and p-choline (5Cuadrado A. Carnero A. Dolfi F. Jimenez B. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2959-2968PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that the evidence for the stimulation of this pathway in mammalian cells remains mostly circumstantial and controversial, because so far no PC-PLC activity has been identifiedin vitro (6Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). In this connection, it should be pointed out that recent work by Luberto and Hannun (7Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that sphingomyelin synthase at least in some cell types accounts for the putative mammalian PC-PLC. On the other hand, PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of PC, thus generating phosphatidic acid, which can be dephosphorylated by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase to produce DAG (8Carnero A. Cuadrado A. del Peso L. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1387-1395PubMed Google Scholar, 9Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Whereas DAG production deriving from PIP2hydrolysis occurs in an early and transient manner, DAG production from PC can be delayed and prolonged, thereby allowing a sustained activation of PKC. A prolonged elevation of DAG is frequently observed with long-acting signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and phorbol esters (10Liscovitch M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 393-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Additional evidence has shown that a sustained rise in DAG levels is a prerequisite for long term cellular responses, such as proliferation and differentiation. However, it is not known whether early or continuous PKC activation is needed for a certain period of time in specific cell compartments during the cell cycle (4Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar). The enzymatic machinery that hydrolyzes PIP2 has been shown to be present in the nucleus also, suggesting that it may be involved in second messenger production within this cell compartment (11Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 12Marmiroli S. Ognibene A. Bavelloni A. Cinti C. Cocco L. Maraldi N.M.

Ricci D. Carini C. Marchisio M. Capitani S. Bertagnolo V. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with IGF-I led to a sustained increase in intranuclear DAG and a decrease in the levels of PIP and PIP2, whereas whole-cell levels of DAG showed no changes. This effect of IGF-I was opposite that of bombesin, because the latter had no effect on nuclear DAG and caused a rise in DAG measured in whole-cell extracts (16Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Such an increase in nuclear DAG mass has been related to the translocation of PKC-α to this cell compartment (16Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 17Martelli A.M. Neri L.M. Gilmour R.S. Barker P.J. Huskisson N.S. Manzoli F.A. Cocco L. Biochem. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Subsequently, other investigations showed the existence of a relationship between mitogenic stimuli and changes in nuclear DAG mass: indeed, during compensatory hepatic growth, a peak in nuclear DAG levels was observed at 20 h following hepatectomy (19Banfic H. Zizak M. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and Sun et al. (20Sun B. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26313-26317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) demonstrated that nuclear DAG rises particularly at the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. Nevertheless, extracellular ligands, such as α-thrombin, could increase nuclear DAG derived, at least in part, from PC hydrolysis (21Jarpe M.B. Leach K.L. Raben D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which was followed by translocation of PKC-α to the nucleus in IIC9 cells (22Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Jarpe M.B. Adams L.D. Fabbro D. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21816-21822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence at the nuclear level of PLD has recently been demonstrated in different cell lines, such as Madin-Darby canine kidney and IIC9 cells (23Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11738-11740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4911-4914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In Swiss 3T3 cells treated with IGF-I, Divecha et al. (16Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) noted that the mass increase in DAG is greater than the combined loss in PIP and PIP2, and they could not rule out a contribution to DAG from other lipids. Moreover, the rise in the nuclear DAG levels was sustained, hinting at the possibility that a phospholipase other than PI-PLC could be involved. Therefore, we decided to analyze whether in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts the nuclear elevation of DAG seen after stimulation with IGF-I derives from either PIP2 or PC. In addition, we wanted to clarify whether or not PKC translocation to the nucleus may depend on DAG derived from either inositol lipids or PC because both DAG species have been shown to be capable of activating PKC in vitro(26Zeisel S.H. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that exclusively nuclear PI-PLC activity is responsible for a rise in DAG levels that is followed by PKC-α translocation to the nucleus. Indeed, DAG production and PKC-α translocation were blocked by a specific PI-PLC inhibitor, whereas chemicals that inhibit formation of DAG from PC were ineffective.

Monoclonal antibody to 5′-BrdUrd was from Becton Dickinson (Milan, Italy). ET-18-OCH3 and D609 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). IGF-I and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit were from Boehringer Mannheim. p81 paper was from Whatman (Maidstone, United Kingdom).

The synthetic peptide RFARKGSLRQKNVHEVKN was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to stimulation, cells were subcultured at a density of 104 cells/cm and incubated until they became confluent (6 days). They were then cultured for an additional 24 h in serum-free medium containing 0.5% BSA. Quiescent cultures were washed twice with serum-free medium containing 0.2% BSA and then incubated in the same medium for the indicated times in the presence of 50 ng/ml of IGF-I. The various phospholipase inhibitors were present starting 5 min prior to simulation, at the following concentrations: ET-18-OCH3, 100 μm; D609, 30 μm; neomycin, 1.2 mm; propranolol, 100 μm; ethanol, 1,3% (250 mm). For cell viability, the trypan blue exclusion test was performed. Briefly, cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 0.2% Trypan Blue in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Positive cells were then scored . This was accomplished as previously reported (11Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106) were suspended in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin for 2 min at 0 °C. Then 500 μl of double-distilled H20 was added, and the cells were allowed to swell for 2 min. Cells were sheared by 10 passages through a 22-gauge needle. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 400 × g for 6 min and washed once in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 2 mmMgCl2, plus protease inhibitors as above. This was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Bio-Rad protein assay (detergent-compatible). The assay was performed according to Divecha et al. (16Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), using DAG kinase enzyme purified from rat brain. DAG was extracted from nuclei, dissolved in 20 μl of CHAPS (9.2 mg/ml), and sonicated at room temperature for 15 s. After the addition of 80 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EGTA), the assay was started by the addition of 20 μl of DAG kinase enzyme followed by 80 μl of reaction buffer containing 5 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Incubation was for 1 h at room temperature; then, phosphatidic acid was extracted, chromatographed, and autoradiographed, and its radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation system (Betamatic IV, Kontron, Milan, Italy). Standard curves were obtained as reported by Divecha et al. (16Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), using 1,2-dioleyl-3-palmitoyl-glycerol as substrate. The procedure outlined by Martelliet al. (11Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) was followed. Assays (100 μl) contained 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.7, 150 mm NaCl, 0.06% sodium deoxycholate, 3 nmol [3H]PIP2(specific activity 30,000 dpm nmol−1), 10 μg of nuclear protein. Incubation was for 30 min at 37 °C. Hydrolysis was stopped by adding chloroform-methanol-HCl, and inositol phosphates were recovered by the aqueous phase were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, using a Partisil 10 SAX column eluted with a linear gradient from distilled water to 2 m ammonium formate (pH 3.7, adjusted with phosphoric acid). Fractions (1 ml) were collected and counted by liquid scintillation. For experiments in the presence of inhibitors, isolated nuclei were preincubated with the chemicals for 5 min on ice. Quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice with serum-free medium containing 0.2% BSA and incubated in the same medium containing 50 ng/ml of IGF-I. Cells were then washed twice in cold PBS, pH 7.2, fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (30 min at room temperature), and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min). The anti-PKC-α polyclonal antibody was used at a dilution of 1:100 in 2% BSA, 3% NGS in PBS. The secondary antibody was a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:500. All incubations were carried out at 37 °C. Finally, the coverslips were mounted in glycerol containing 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane to retard fading, using additional coverslips as spacers to preserve the three-dimensional structure of cells. Samples were imaged by a LSM410 CLSM (Zeiss, Oberckochen, Germany). This confocal system was coupled with a 1 mW HeNe ion laser as light source, used to reveal the Cy3 signal with a 543-nm wavelength. Samples were observed with a × 100, 1.4 numerical aperture, Planneofluar objective lens. Images were acquired, frame by frame, with a scanning mode format of 512 × 512 pixels. Digitalized optical sections, i.e. Z series of confocal data (“stacks”) were transferred from the CLSM to the graphics workstation Indy (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA) and stored on the graphics workstation with a scanning mode format of 512 × 512 pixels and 256 gray levels. The image processing was performed using the ImageSpace software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To reduce the unwanted background noise generated by the photomultiplier signal amplification, all the image stacks were treated with a three-dimensional filter (Gaussian filtering) that was carried out on each voxel, with a mask of 3 pixels in the x, y, and z directions (3 × 3 × 3). Photographs were taken by a digital video recorder Focus ImageCorder Plus (Focus Graphics, Foster City, CA) using 100 ASA TMax black and white film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Nuclear proteins separated by 8.0% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets using a semidry blotting apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Sheets were saturated in PBS containing 5% NGS and 4% BSA for 60 min at 37 °C (blocking buffer) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to PKC-α, diluted 1:2,000. After four washes in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, they were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, diluted 1:3,000 in PBS-Tween-20, and washed as above. Bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Isolated nuclei (10 μg of protein) were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 0.4 μg/ml histone H1, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, in the presence of 1.2 mmCaCl2, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 3.3 μm dioleylglycerol. The reactions were terminated with 15 μl of acetic acid and spotted onto Whatman p81 paper, followed by washing with 0.75 mm H3PO4. Radioactivity was measured by Cerenkov counting. In some cases, instead of histone H1, 10 μg of the synthetic peptide RFARKGSLRQKNVHEVKN (corresponding to amino acids 19–36 of PKC) was employed as substrate. An equal volume of Laemmli's sample buffer was added, and proteins were separated using 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, dried, and autoradiographed. The radioactive bands were excised and counted using a liquid scintillation counter. Cells at 15 h after IGF-I stimulation were labeled with 100 μm5′-BrdUrd for 10 min as described previously (28Neri L.M. Mazzotti G. Capitani S. Maraldi N.M. Cinti C. Baldini N. Rana R. Martelli A.M. Histochemistry. 1992; 98: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Samples were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and then DNA was denatured in 4 n HCl for 30 min and fixed in a −20 °C graded ethanol series to prevent reannealing. Slides were then air-dried and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with a monoclonal antibody to 5′-BrdUrd diluted 1:10 in PBS, 2% BSA, and 3% NGS. Slides were then washed three times in PBS and reacted with a Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:400 in PBS, 2% BSA, 5% NGS for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were subsequently washed three times in PBS and mounted as detailed above. Data are the mean from three different experiments and are expressed in the tables as mean ± S.D. Significant differences (p < 0.01) in a Student's paired t test are indicated in the tables by an asterisk. All of the other differences were found to be not significant withp > 0.01. Nuclei were isolated from cells after different times of IGF-I stimulation and assayed for DAG levels. Control nuclei contained about 75 pmol/mg protein of DAG, but after only 5 min of mitogenic stimulation, this value rose to 245 pmol/mg protein, i.e. a 3.25-fold increase (Fig. 1 A). This value was essentially maintained for the following 30 min, as shown in Fig. 1, in agreement with Divecha et al. (16Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), even though the method we have employed to isolate nuclei is different from theirs. However, after 60 min, nuclear DAG mass returned to basal levels (data not shown). To assess the nuclear phospholipase activity responsible for the DAG production that follows IGF-I stimulation of 3T3 cells, we employed inhibitors that interfere with several enzymes that may be involved in DAG formation. First, the specific PI-PLC inhibitor, ET-18-OCH3 (100 μm) was used. As presented in Fig. 1 A, exposure of intact cells for 5 min to this chemical resulted in a slight decrease in nuclear DAG levels (about 15%), to 63 pmol/mg protein. When cells exposed to this chemical were stimulated with IGF-I, no DAG rise was observed at any time (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained when the nonselective phospholipase inhibitor neomycin (1.2 mm) was employed (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, 30 μm D609 (which is thought to be a PC-PLC specific inhibitor, even though so far no such mammalian enzyme has been shown to be sensitive in vitro to this chemical), as well as propranolol (a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase inhibitor, 100 μm) and 1.3% ethanol (which causes PLD to generate phosphatidylethanol rather than phosphatidic acid), did not affect the basal levels of nuclear DAG (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, in these cases, the rise in nuclear DAG that followed IGF-I stimulation was comparable to that seen in controls (Fig. 1 B). Next, we wanted to analyze whether changes in the nuclear DAG mass could also be abolished by different concentrations of the chemicals. Thus, cells were pretreated with the chemicals for 5 min and then stimulated for 15 min with IGF-I, the nuclei were isolated, and the nuclear DAG mass was measured. The results are presented in Table I. When used at 10 μm, ET-18-OCH3 resulted in an approximately 45% decrease in the production of DAG, in good agreement with the IC50 of this chemical (20Sun B. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26313-26317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When employed at 50 μm, the inhibition was 60%. No significant inhibitory effect of D609 was observed in a range of 10–30 μm.Table IEffect of different concentrations of PI-PLC and PC-PLC inhibitors on the production of nuclear DAG in vivo after 15 min of IGF-I stimulation.InhibitorDAG masspmol/mg of nuclear proteinNone (control)255 ± 1910 μmET-18-OCH3141 ± 12*50 μmET-18-OCH3102 ± 9.6*100 μmET-18-OCH360 ± 5.5*10 μmD609245 ± 2120 μm D609241 ± 2030 μm D609238 ± 20Quiescent cells were treated for 5 min with the chemicals, and then stimulated with IGF-I.

The data are the mean ± S.D. from three separate experiments. An asterisk indicates values that are significantly different (p < 0.01) from control. We next assayed in vitro PLC activity in nuclei isolated from cells at various times after IGF-I stimulation using high performance liquid chromatography analysis of radiolabeled IP3 derived from [3H]PIP2hydrolysis. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the rate of IP3 generation corresponded well with that of nuclear DAG. In fact, in control nuclei a nearly 4-fold increase was observed after 5 min of stimulation. Again, a plateau was present up to 30 min. On the contrary, when either ET-18-OCH3 or neomycin sulfate were used, this PLC activity was reduced to negligible levels (Fig. 2 A) for all the examined times, resulting in less than 10% of the original activity. The addition of either D609 or propranolol did not block IP3 formation, which was similar to control nuclei (Fig. 2 B). The increase in nuclear DAG described above has already been suggested to be the driving force that attracts PKC to the nucleus (16Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, no clear evidence has been presented thus far. Therefore, we investigated this issue using a PKC-α-specific antibody, because it has previously been demonstrated that IGF-I induces in Swiss 3T3 cells the selective nuclear translocation of this isoform (18Neri L.M. Billi A.M. Manzoli L. Rubbini S. Gilmour R.S. Cocco L. Martelli A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By means of CLSM, in quiescent cells PKC-α, was mainly detected in the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear region. Nuclei, identified by means of phase-contrast microscopy (data not shown) were immunolabeled to a much lower extent (Fig. 3 A). Incubation of cells with IGF-I showed a progressive increase of PKC-α labeling in the nuclear interior starting from 5 min after IGF-I stimulation (data not shown) and reaching a maximum after 30 min (Fig. 3 B). When Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were preincubated with either ET-18-OCH3 or neomycin, no nuclear translocation of PKC-α was observed (Fig. 3,C and D, respectively). On the other hand, if D609 or propranolol were administered to the cells 5 min before mitogenic stimulation with IGF-I, nuclear translocation of PKC-α was similar to that of control cells after 30 min of stimulation (see Fig. 3, E and F, and compare with Fig. 3 B). In Table II we report the percentage of cells displaying a nuclear translocation of PKC-α following IGF-I stimulation under the various conditions listed above. It is evident that exposure to either ET-18-OCH3 or neomycin sulfate completely blocked nuclear translocation of the kinase. In contrast, chemicals interfering with DAG production from PC did not affect the accumulation of PKC within the nucleus.Table IIPercentage of cells showing nuclear translocation of PKC-αCell treatmentCells with nuclear translocationNone (quiescent)2 ± 1IGF-I38 ± 5*IGF-I + ET-18-OCH3 (100 μm)5 ± 2IGF-I + neomycin (1.2 mm)4 ± 2IGF-I + D609 (30 μm)36 ± 4*IGF-I + propranolol (100 mm)35 ± 4*For each experiment, 300 cells were counted.

Open table in a new tab For each experiment, 300 cells were counted. The data are the mean ± S.D. from three separate experiments. An asterisk indicates values that are significantly different (p < 0.01) from control. We next investigated nuclear translocation of PKC-α by means of Western blotting analysis. In nuclei prepared from unstimulated cells, a band with a molecular mass of 80 kDa was seen (Fig. 4, lane a). After 30 min of treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with IGF-I, there was a clear increase in the amount of nuclear PKC-α (Fig. 4, lane b). This effect was not evident when ET-18-OCH3 or neomycin were administered to the cells prior to stimulation (Fig. 4, lanes c and d). The translocation of PKC-α to the nucleus induced by IGF-I was clearly visible when D609, propranolol, or ethanol were used prior to IGF-I exposure (Fig. 4, lanes e–g). The PKC-α activity present in isolated nuclei was first assayed using histone H1 as substrate. Some activity was detected in nuclei from quiescent cells (Fig. 5 A), in agreement with the results of both immunocytochemical and immunochemical experiments. However, in nuclei prepared from cells treated for 30 min with IGF-I, a more than 5-fold increase in PKC activity was measured. This increase was almost completely abolished by either ET-18-OCH3 or neomycin sulfate, whereas D609, propranolol, and ethanol were ineffective (Fig. 5 A). Similar results were obtained when the synthetic peptide RFARKGSLRQKNVHEVKN (corresponding to amino acids 19–36 of PKC) was employed as substrate instead of histone H1, as presented in Fig. 5 B. To assess the percentage of cells that entered S-phase of the cell cycle after treatment with IGF-I in the absence or presence of various chemicals, we used labeling with 5′-BrdUrd followed by fluorescent immunostaining. The results from these experiments are presented in Table III. We checked cell proliferation at 15 h after mitogenic stimulation because it has previously been reported that at this time after a mitogenic stimulus one can detect a higher number of cells that have entered S-phase than at previous or"

Although the associating factors and the candidate genes for c-Myc targets have been identified as above, precise mechanisms of the regulation of versatile c-Myc functions as well as signal transduction pathways to c-myc remain unclear. Further clarification of the mechanisms necessarily involves cloning and characterization of yet unknown proteins around c-Myc. We describe here a novel protein termed MM-1, which associates with c-Myc and represses the transcription activity of c-Myc.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCellsHuman HeLa, monkey CV-1, monkey COS-I and hamster CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum.Cloning of MM-1 by Two-hybrid SystemSaccharomyes cerevisiae HF7C cells containing thelacZ gene driven by the GAL1 promoter were transformed first with pGBT-c-Myc. The transformant yeast cells were subsequently transformed with Human HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA (CLONTECH), a cDNA library expressing the GAL4 activation domain fused to cDNAs from human HeLa cells. About 2 × 105 colonies were screened for β-galactosidase expression, and the plasmid DNAs in the LacZ-positive cells were extracted by the procedure described in the protocols fromCLONTECH. A plasmid thus obtained was named pGAD-#9 and analyzed. Because the EcoRI-XhoI fragment insert of cDNA in pGAD-#9 did not contain the ATG initiation codon, the λgt11 human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) was further screened with the labeled insert of pGAD-#9 as a probe. The longest cDNA obtained was inserted to the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK(−), and the construct was named pBS-MM-1.In Vitro Binding AssayGST-MM-1 and GST were purified from a 1,000-ml culture of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pGEX-MM-1 and pGEX-6P-1, respectively, as described previously (26Graham F.J. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar).

Although the associating factors and the candidate genes for c-Myc targets have been identified as above, precise mechanisms of the regulation of versatile c-Myc functions as well as signal transduction pathways to c-myc remain unclear. Further clarification of the mechanisms necessarily involves cloning and characterization of yet unknown proteins around c-Myc. We describe here a novel protein termed MM-1, which associates with c-Myc and represses the transcription activity of c-Myc. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCellsHuman HeLa, monkey CV-1, monkey COS-I and hamster CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum.Cloning of MM-1 by Two-hybrid SystemSaccharomyes cerevisiae HF7C cells containing thelacZ gene driven by the GAL1 promoter were transformed first with pGBT-c-Myc. The transformant yeast cells were subsequently transformed with Human HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA (CLONTECH), a cDNA library expressing the GAL4 activation domain fused to cDNAs from human HeLa cells. About 2 × 105 colonies were screened for β-galactosidase expression, and the plasmid DNAs in the LacZ-positive cells were extracted by the procedure described in the protocols fromCLONTECH. A plasmid thus obtained was named pGAD-#9 and analyzed. Because the EcoRI-XhoI fragment insert of cDNA in pGAD-#9 did not contain the ATG initiation codon, the λgt11 human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) was further screened with the labeled insert of pGAD-#9 as a probe. The longest cDNA obtained was inserted to the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK(−), and the construct was named pBS-MM-1.In Vitro Binding AssayGST-MM-1 and GST were purified from a 1,000-ml culture of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pGEX-MM-1 and pGEX-6P-1, respectively, as described previously (26Graham F.J.

About 2 × 105 colonies were screened for β-galactosidase expression, and the plasmid DNAs in the LacZ-positive cells were extracted by the procedure described in the protocols fromCLONTECH. A plasmid thus obtained was named pGAD-#9 and analyzed. Because the EcoRI-XhoI fragment insert of cDNA in pGAD-#9 did not contain the ATG initiation codon, the λgt11 human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) was further screened with the labeled insert of pGAD-#9 as a probe. The longest cDNA obtained was inserted to the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK(−), and the construct was named pBS-MM-1.

In Vitro Binding AssayGST-MM-1 and GST were purified from a 1,000-ml culture of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pGEX-MM-1 and pGEX-6P-1, respectively, as described previously (26Graham F.J. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar). Two μg of the purified GST-MM-1 or GST were first applied to GST-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA. The 35S-labeled c-Myc or its deletion mutants synthesized in vitro using pGEM-c-myc(ATG) or pcDNA3-MYC deletions, respectively, as a template in the coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) were then applied to the column.

https://openalex.org/W1974709847,"Monocytes rolling on the endothelial cell layer interact with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) that is tethered to the proteoglycans on the luminal side of the endothelial cells and consequently initiate adhesion of monocytes in the early phase of immune response. The amino acid residues in MCP-1 involved in tethering to the proteoglycans have not been elucidated. MCP-1 showed binding to [3H]heparin with aK D of 1.5 μm. We substituted lysine or histidine residues at the C-terminal end of MCP-1 with alanine residues and tested these mutants for their ability to bind heparin, heparan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and chondroitin sulfate-C. Substitution of Lys-58 or His-66 drastically reduced glycosaminoglycan binding. Substitution of Lys-56 or deletion of the five amino acid residues at the C terminus, including Lys-75, did not alter the heparin binding ability, suggesting that the other lysine residues at the C terminus are not involved in glycosaminoglycan binding. MCP-1 and its mutants did not bind hyaluronic acid as strongly as the other subunits of the GAGs. Substitution of Lys-58 or His-66 by alanine that prevented glycosaminoglycan binding did not affect Ca2+ influx, receptor binding, or chemotactic activity elicited by the chemokine on monocytic THP-1 cells. Therefore, we conclude that the Lys-58 and His-66 residues in the C-terminal α-helix of MCP-1 are essential for glycosaminoglycan binding and probably for the binding to the endothelial surface proteoglycans. Monocytes rolling on the endothelial cell layer interact with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) that is tethered to the proteoglycans on the luminal side of the endothelial cells and consequently initiate adhesion of monocytes in the early phase of immune response. The amino acid residues in MCP-1 involved in tethering to the proteoglycans have not been elucidated. MCP-1 showed binding to [3H]heparin with aK D of 1.5 μm. We substituted lysine or histidine residues at the C-terminal end of MCP-1 with alanine residues and tested these mutants for their ability to bind heparin, heparan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and chondroitin sulfate-C. Substitution of Lys-58 or His-66 drastically reduced glycosaminoglycan binding. Substitution of Lys-56 or deletion of the five amino acid residues at the C terminus, including Lys-75, did not alter the heparin binding ability, suggesting that the other lysine residues at the C terminus are not involved in glycosaminoglycan binding. MCP-1 and its mutants did not bind hyaluronic acid as strongly as the other subunits of the GAGs. Substitution of Lys-58 or His-66 by alanine that prevented glycosaminoglycan binding did not affect Ca2+ influx, receptor binding, or chemotactic activity elicited by the chemokine on monocytic THP-1 cells. Therefore, we conclude that the Lys-58 and His-66 residues in the C-terminal α-helix of MCP-1 are essential for glycosaminoglycan binding and probably for the binding to the endothelial surface proteoglycans. monocyte chemoattractant protein macrophage inflammatory protein glycosaminoglycan phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

This receptor binding activates the monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cells, followed by diapedesis through interendothelial junction and migration of the monocytes through the MCP-1 gradient to the point of production of MCP-1 at the site of injury or infection.Proteoglycans are proteins that are posttranslationally modified by the addition of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains at serine residues. The common GAGs are heparin, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid characterized by the disaccharide repeats (26Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). These peripherally arranged, highly charged polysaccharide side chains are thought to tether MCP-1 secreted from endothelial cells. Certain basic residues in the C-terminal α-helix of PF4, a member of CXC chemokine family, were found to be responsible for heparin binding (27Maione T.E. Gray G.S. Hunt A.J. Sharpe R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2077-2083PubMed Google Scholar). Progressive C-terminal truncation of the α-helix of interleukin-8 inhibited heparin binding (28Webb L.M.C. Ehrengruber M.U. Clark-Lewis I Baggiolini M. Rot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7158-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues involved in the heparin binding of the members of CC chemokine family are not well understood. In MIP-1α, one study reported that two basic residues were involved in binding heparin as well as the receptor (29Graham G.J. Wilkinson P.C. Nibbs R.J.B. Lowe S. Kolset S.O. Parker A. Freshney M.G. Tsang L.-S. Pragnell I.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6506-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Another report indicated that three noncontiguous basic residues were responsible for binding GAG without affecting interaction with MIP-1α receptor (30Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Residues involved in the proteoglycan binding of MCP-1 have not been elucidated. Here we report that substitution of Lys-58 and His-66 with alanine in the C-terminal α-helix of MCP-1, but not the other basic residues at the C-terminal end, prevents GAG binding without affecting receptor binding, Ca2+ influx, or chemotactic activity.RESULTSSince positively charged residues in the C terminus, located away from the receptor-binding N-terminal region, appeared to be likely sites for binding negatively charged proteoglycan, the effect of removal of such charges on proteoglycan binding was tested. Constructs for deletion of five amino acids including Lys-75 (CΔ5) and substitution of several residues (K56A, K58A, V60K, H66A, K69A, K75A, and a double mutant K58A/V60K) at the C terminus of MCP-1 were made to test for the effect of such modifications on GAG binding. Expression of the mutants in the insect cell system showed that CΔ5, K56A, K58A, and H66A recombinant constructs yielded proteins in the culture fluid; others were not secreted. SDS-PAGE of the resulting purified proteins showed single band at 8.66 kDa (Fig. 1). Immunoblot analysis with rabbit antibodies prepared against human MCP-1 showed a single cross reacting band that coincided with the protein band in each case (data not shown).Interaction of MCP-1 with [3H]heparin was measured. We analyzed the results by non-linear curve fitting and found that heparin bound to MCP-1 with a K D of 1.5 μm(Fig. 2 A). K58A and H66A mutants of MCP-1 showed drastically reduced binding compared with that of the wild type MCP-1 protein (Fig. 2 A and Table I). On the other hand, K56A and CΔ5 mutants bound [3H]heparin just as well as the wild type MCP-1 with similar K D (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table I).Figure 2Binding of heparin with MCP-1 and its mutant.

The values for chemotaxis were obtained at 10 nm chemokine. Open table in a new tab By competition assays, the binding affinities of the wild type MCP-1 was tested with various GAGs, such as heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate-C, and hyaluronic acid. Based on the saturation curve determined in the [3H]heparin binding experiment (Fig. 2 A), 14 μm chemokine was added for competition assays. Chondroitin sulfate-C, heparan sulfate, and heparin competed with similar affinities to bind MCP-1. The relativeK D values for heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate-C, and heparin were close to each other (Table I). Since GAGs contain a range of molecular weights, the K D values for competition assays were calculated using the average molecular weights indicated in Table I. Binding affinity of wild type MCP-1 for hyaluronic acid was much lower compared with the affinity for heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate-C (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3Competition between heparin and other GAGs for binding MCP-1 and its mutants. 3 μg of MCP-1 (A) or K56A (B) mutant was incubated with [3H]heparin alone or with unlabeled heparin (circle), chondroitin sulfate-C (square), heparan sulfate (diamond), or hyaluronic acid (triangle), and [3H]heparin bound to the protein was measured as indicated under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)K56A and CΔ5 mutants bound to [3H]heparin just like wild type (Fig. 2, A and B). The experimentally determined K D value for both K56A and CΔ5 mutants was 1.55 μm. Data from Fig. 2 and theK D values of MCP-1, K56A, and CΔ5 confirmed that the substitutions or deletion of those residues did not alter the binding of the ligand to heparin. In contrast, binding of K58A or H66K mutants was reduced drastically.In the competition assays, chondroitin-C, heparin, or heparan sulfate competed with [3H]heparin with similar affinities for binding the mutant K56A (Fig. 3 B and Table I). Similar to the wild type MCP-1, binding affinity of the mutant K56A for hyaluronic acid was lower compared with the affinity for the rest of the GAGs. The competition for mutants K58A and H66A could not be tested due to their poor heparin binding ability.The involvement of histidine in GAG binding is unusual, as lysines and arginines are the commonly involved residues in other GAG-binding proteins. To further test for the role of histidine in GAG binding of MCP, pH dependence of heparin binding was determined (Fig. 4). Changes in GAG binding with pH showed the involvement of a residue with a pK a of 6.8, strongly supporting the proposed role of a histidine residue of MCP-1 in heparin binding. K D for heparin binding increased with pH from 5 nm at pH 5.8 to 16 nm at pH 6.8 and to 29 nm at pH 7.8.Figure 4pH dependence of heparin binding to MCP-1. Experimental details are the same as in Fig. 2, except that 24 mm phosphate buffer of the indicated pH was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since substitution of amino acids might perturb the structure of the chemokine and thus affect its binding to GAGs and biological function, we tested whether the mutations in the C-terminal regions affected the receptor binding, elicitation of Ca2+ influx, and chemotaxis, using the monocytic THP1 cell line, which expresses CCR-2B receptor of MCP-1. Receptor binding was tested in THP1 cells in presence of different amounts of wild type MCP-1. The mutants bound the receptor with the same K D as the wild type (Table I). Thus, the mutations in the C terminus did not affect receptor binding.Elevation of intracellular calcium was measured with a range of concentrations of the wild type MCP-1 and four mutants with THP-1 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). At 2 nm concentration of the wild type MCP-1, the peak fluorescence was 49% of the saturation fluorescence (caused by digitonin). Similar pattern of fluorescence peaks were obtained by the mutants (Fig. 5 A). At 4 nm concentration of MCP-1 and mutants, the fluorescence peak was similar to that observed at 2 nm concentration. Thus, the results indicated that the amino acid substitution at residues 58 and 66 did not affect the biological response as far as Ca2+ influx was concerned.Figure 5Measurement of intracellular Ca2+flux induced by MCP-1 and its mutants in THP-1 cells.

The mutants showed chemotactic activity virtually identical to that observed with wild type MCP-1.

Chemotaxis was measured in THP-1 cells with MCP-1 (dotted bar), K58A (vertically striped bar), and H66A (solid black bar). To compare the data obtained by different mutants, we expressed the fluorescence values as the percentage of the migration to recombinant wild type MCP-1 at 0.1 nm concentration in each separate experiment. The error bars represent the standard deviation from the six measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe proteoglycans on the luminal surface of endothelial cells are thought to tether MCP-1 to present it to circulating monocytes without being carried away by the blood flow. To identify the specific residues of MCP-1 involved in proteoglycan binding, we tested the effect of substitution of several basic residues at the C terminus of MCP-1 with alanine on GAG binding. The work presented here identifies two amino acids at the C-terminal α-helix of MCP-1 that probably play a critical role in the binding of MCP-1 with GAGs. The substitution of Lys-58 and His-66 with alanine abolished the heparin binding ability of MCP-1. However, substitution of a nearby lysine with alanine (K56A) did not affect binding. In addition, deletion of five amino acids including Lys-75 (CΔ5) from the C-terminal α-helix of MCP-1 also did not affect the heparin binding ability. The K D values of heparin binding to MCP-1 and its mutants were extremely similar at around 1.5 μm. In the competition assays, the wild type MCP-1 or K56A bound to chondroitin sulfate-C and heparan sulfate much more strongly than to hyaluronic acid.Affinity between the chemokine and GAG is most likely based on ionic interaction. The limited number of studies conducted on the binding of chemokines to GAGs have reached somewhat conflicting conclusions about the regions involved in proteoglycan binding. In CXC chemokine the C terminus is highly basic, and in the two cases of such chemokines that have been studied, this basic region was suggested to be involved in GAG association. Progressive reduction of heparin binding was caused by successive deletions of three to four residues from the C-terminal α-helix of interleukin-8 (28Webb L.M.C. Ehrengruber M.U. Clark-Lewis I Baggiolini M. Rot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7158-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In PF4, another member of CXC chemokine family, substitution of two pairs of lysines at 61/62 and at 65/66 with Gln and Glu in the α-helix abolished heparin binding (27Maione T.E. Gray G.S. Hunt A.J. Sharpe R.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2077-2083PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this case, substitution of the positive charges with negative charges complicated the interpretation concerning the role of the lysine residues in binding the negatively charged heparin. Another study indicated that substitution of Arg-20, Arg-22, and Arg-49 simultaneously with Gln decreased heparin binding even more than that caused by substitution of Lys-61, Lys-62, Lys-65, and Lys-66 simultaneously with Ala (39Mayo K.H. Ilyina E. Roongta V. Dundas M. Joseph J. Lai C.K. Maione T.E. Daly T.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In certain members of the CC chemokine family such as RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MCP-2, the conserved Arg residues found at positions 18, 46, and 48 are thought to be involved in heparin binding. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that these residues were required for MIP-1α to bind heparin (29Graham G.J. Wilkinson P.C. Nibbs R.J.B. Lowe S. Kolset S.O. Parker A. Freshney M.G. Tsang L.-S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Based on the limited amount of information available on chemokine binding to heparin, the need to review the proposed primary structure for heparin binding motif (40Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been pointed out (39Mayo K.H. Ilyina E. Roongta V. Dundas M. Joseph J. Lai C.K. Maione T.E. Daly T.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of different heparin-binding proteins other than chemokines (41Mourey L. Samama J.P. Delarue M. Pepitou M. Choay J. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 42van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Lalouel J.M. Cambillau C. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1274-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that spatial proximity of positively charged amino acids in the three-dimensional structure probably makes the heparin binding site. According to the reported results pertaining to the GAG binding of MIP-1α and the present results on the amino acid residues of MCP-1 involved in GAG binding, it is clear that even within the CC chemokine family different structural features may be involved in this binding. In the present study, substitution for Lys-58 and His-66 in the C-terminal α-helix of MCP-1 virtually eliminated heparin binding. In three-dimensional structure, these residues are located in spatial proximity to play a significant role in heparin binding. (Fig. 7). The unusual involvement of a histidine, rather than the arginines and lysines that are usually found to be involved in GAG binding, was strongly supported by the pH dependence of GAG binding that showed a critical role for a residue with a pK a of 6.8. As expected from the involvement of histidine in heparin binding, K D was pH-dependent, increasing from 5 nm at pH 5.8 to 29 nm at pH 7.8. Substitution at position 56 or deletion of residues 72–76 (CΔ5) from the C terminus did not affect heparin binding, suggesting that the positively charged residues at 56 and 75 had no role in GAG binding. According to the crystal structure, these residues do not reside within the α-helix region (17Lubkowski J. Bujacz G. Boqué L. Domaille P.J. Handel T.M. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).Figure 7Proposed model for MCP-1 interaction with its receptor while tethered to the endothelial cells by the interaction of the C-terminal lysine 58 and histidine 66 (arrows) residues with the proteoglycan on the cell surface. The N-terminal rod inserted into the membrane is involved in interaction with G-protein, the red residues were shown to be required for receptor binding, and the green (Tyr) is involved in receptor selectivity. The amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region of MCP is shown at the bottom with the residues in the α-helix in bold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The relationship between the binding site of the chemokines for proteoglycan and the receptor is not clear. In MIP-1α, substitution of amino acid residues suspected to be involved in GAG binding was reported to eliminate also receptor binding (29Graham G.J. Wilkinson P.C. Nibbs R.J.B. Lowe S. Kolset S.O. Parker A. Freshney M.G. Tsang L.-S. Pragnell I.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6506-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, in another study, the three noncontiguous amino acid residues that define GAG binding site were not found to be a prerequisite for receptor binding and signaling by MIP-1α in vitro (30Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A triple mutant in which the basic amino acids at 45, 46, and 48 were replaced with neutral amino acids did bind CC-CKR1, albeit less well than the wild type, and showed undiminished chemotactic activity (44Crisman, J. M., Kolattukudy, P. E. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). Substitution of the basic amino acid residues in the putative GAG binding sites may affect the receptor binding indirectly and such affects may not have physiological relevance. In fact, the presence of GAG in the chemotaxis assay medium for MIP-1α showed no effect (30Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 44Crisman, J. M., Kolattukudy, P. E. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar), indicating that the proteoglycan binding does not interfere with the receptor binding. In the case of MCP-1, our results show that mutations in the α-helix that drastically decreased heparin binding had no effect on receptor binding, calcium flux, and chemotaxis. These results clearly separate receptor binding of MCP-1 from proteoglycan binding and strongly suggest that the α-helix is involved only in the MCP-1 presentation to the monocyte. GAG binding can cause multimerization of chemokines (45Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S. Proudfoot A.E. Borlat F. Clark- Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). As expected from this hypothesis, the number of GAG bound per mole of chemokine is very small in all of the binding experiments. The “polymerization” of the chemokines increases the local concentration of the chemokine and thus enhances the binding to the high affinity receptors within the local environment (45Hoogewerf A.J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar).The finding that the two positively charged residues in the C-terminal α-helix are involved in the tethering of the chemokine is consistent with a general model for the MCP-1 function (Fig. 7). According to the model, the C-terminal α-helix is used to tether the chemokine to the luminal side of the endothelial cells of the blood vessel via the ionic interaction between the two juxtapositioned basic amino acid residues (positions 58 and 66) (Fig. 7) with the negatively charged extracellular proteoglycans. This would leave the N-terminal extended rod and the base of this rod for binding to the receptor on the monocyte rolling on the endothelial layer. Based on the available information, it has been concluded that the residues Asp-3, Thr-10, Tyr-13, Ser-34, and"

Here we show that Vif is phosphorylated and regulated by p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Vif phosphorylation by MAPK was demonstrated in vitro as well as in vivoand was shown to occur on serine and threonine residues. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping indicated that Vif is phosphorylated by MAPK on the same sites in vitro and in vivo. Radioactive peptide sequencing identified two phosphorylation sites, Thr96 and Ser165. These phosphorylation sites do not correspond to the known optimum consensus sequences for phosphorylation by MAPK (PX(S/T)P) nor to the minimum consensus sequence ((S/T)P), indicating that MAPK can phosphorylate proteins at sites other than those containing the PX(S/T)P or (S/T)P motifs. Synthetic Vif peptides corresponding to the local sequences of the phosphorylation sites were not phosphorylated by MAPK, suggesting that recognition of these sites by MAPK is likely to require structural determinants outside the phosphorylation site. Mutations of the Thr96 site, which is conserved among Vif sequences from HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV, resulted in significant loss of Vif activity and inhibition of HIV-1 replication. These results suggest that MAPK plays a direct role in regulating HIV-1 replication and infectivity by phosphorylating Vif and identify a novel mechanism for activation of HIV-1 replication by mitogens and other extracellular stimuli.

Several lines of evidence suggest that Vif plays a role in virus assembly (1Gabuzda D.H. Lawrence K. Langhoff E. Terwilliger E. Dorfman T. Haseltine W.A. Sodroski J. J.

Virology. 1994; 201: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that one of the Gag or Pol proteins may be a target for the action of Vif. Some immortalized cell lines do not require Vif to produce fully infectious virus (1Gabuzda D.H. Lawrence K. Langhoff E. Terwilliger E. Dorfman T. Haseltine W.A. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6489-6495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2von Schwedler U. Song J. Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4945-4955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sakai H. Shibata R. Sakuragi J.

Virol. 1993; 67: 6322-6326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Vif may compensate for a cell-specific factor or neutralize an inhibitory factor that interferes with correct virus assembly. Membrane association of Vif is important for its biological activity and appears to be mediated by an interaction between basic domains in the C terminus and a membrane-associated protein (14Goncalves J. Shi B. Yang X. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7196-7204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We previously demonstrated that Vif is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues by a cellular kinase(s) (15Yang X. Goncalves J. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10121-10129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Vif phosphorylation was shown to occur on Ser144, Thr155, and Thr188. Mutation of Ser144, which is contained within the most highly conserved motif in Vif proteins from all lentiviruses, resulted in significant loss of Vif activity and inhibited HIV-1 replication, suggesting that phosphorylation at this site plays an important role in regulating virus replication and infectivity. The kinase(s) that phosphorylates Vif was not identified. The Vif kinase(s) was relatively insensitive to inhibitors of protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent kinase, and cGMP-dependent kinase, suggesting that it is distinct from these enzymes.A critical aspect of HIV-1 replication in T lymphocytes is activation by mitogens and other extracellular stimuli (16McCune J.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the signal transduction pathways that activate HIV-1 replication in response to extracellular stimulation. Previous studies have shown that the HIV-1 p17 Gag, p24 Gag, Vif, Vpu, Rev, and Nef proteins are phosphorylated by cellular kinases in vitro and in vivo (15Yang X. Goncalves J. Gabuzda D. J. Biol.

Virol. 1994; 68: 2260-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, many kinases that phosphorylate and regulate the functions of HIV-1 proteins have not been identified.In this report, we show that HIV-1 Vif is phosphorylated on Thr96 and Ser165 by p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (also known as ERK1 and ERK2, hereafter referred to as MAPK) both in vitro and in vivo. These sites do not correspond to the known consensus sites for MAPK substrates, indicating that MAPK can phosphorylate proteins at sites other than those containing the PX(S/T)P or (S/T)P motifs. Mutations of the Thr96 site, which is highly conserved among Vif sequences from HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV, result in loss of Vif activity and inhibition of HIV-1 replication, suggesting that phosphorylation at this site is likely to be important for Vif activity. These results provide a direct link between MAPK and the regulation of HIV-1 replication and infectivity. This mechanism may contribute to the activation of HIV-1 replication by mitogens and other extracellular stimuli.DISCUSSIONERK1 and ERK2 MAPK are serine/threonine kinases that are present in all cell types and play a critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in response to mitogens and a wide variety of growth factors and cytokines (reviewed in Refs. 31Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar). Upon activation, these closely related MAPK isoforms phosphorylate a large number of substrates including transcription factors (e.g. c-Myc, c-Jun, NF-IL6, ATF-2, and AP-1), the EGF receptor, phospholipase A2, tyrosine hydroxylase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2C, and cytoskeletal proteins (Refs. 31Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, and 38Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar and references therein). MAPK can also phosphorylate and activate kinases, such as p90rsk and MAPKAP kinase 2. The MAPKs themselves are activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues via the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (reviewed in Ref. 34Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Activation of MAPK occurs during the G0/G1 transition and may be required for progression through the cell cycle (38Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar, 39Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Trends Biochem.

Thus, MAPK serves to link extracellular stimuli to cellular events involved in proliferation and differentiation, including the cell cycle, generation of phospholipid messengers, transcription, and translation. Other MAPKs in mammalian cells are c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38/HOG, which are activated by stress stimuli and inflammatory cytokines.In this study, we demonstrate that the HIV-1 Vif protein is phosphorylated by p44/42 MAPK. Furthermore, our studies suggest that MAPK phosphorylation of Vif plays a role in regulating HIV-1 replication and infectivity. The phosphorylation of Vif by MAPK was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo and was shown to occur on Thr96 and Ser165. Phosphorylation by MAPK is likely to occur on the same sites in vitro and in vivo based on similar patterns of two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Mutations of the Thr96 site, which is highly conserved in HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV, results in significant loss of Vif function and inhibition of HIV-1 replication. These results suggest that MAPK can regulate HIV-1 replication and infectivity by phosphorylating Vif. This mechanism may contribute to the activation of HIV-1 replication by mitogens and other extracellular stimuli. A comparison of Thr96 mutations with a mutation at the Ser144 phosphorylation site identified in a previous study (15Yang X. Goncalves J. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10121-10129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) suggests that Vif function and HIV-1 replication can be significantly impaired by loss of phosphorylation at either site. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that alternative models such as alterations in Vif structure or the ability of Vif to interact with a target protein may account for the impaired function of these mutants. The biological importance of the phosphorylation site at Ser165, which is less conserved than Thr96, or other minor phosphorylation sites that may be utilized by MAPK (Fig. 5) remains to be determined.We previously identified Ser144, Thr155, and Thr188 as major phosphorylation sites in Vif (15Yang X. Goncalves J. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10121-10129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These findings, together with the identification of the Ser165phosphorylation site, indicate that four phosphorylation sites are located within the C-terminal region. The hydrophilic C-terminal region of Vif is likely to be exposed on the surface of the molecule and thus may be accessible to cellular kinase(s) (15Yang X. Goncalves J. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10121-10129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C-terminal region appears to be important for interactions between Vif and a membrane-associated protein (14Goncalves J. Shi B. Yang X. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7196-7204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and possibly the p55 Gag precursor (43Bouyac M. Courcoul M. Bertoia G. Baudat Y. Gabuzda D. Blanc D. Chazal N. Boulanger P. Sire J. Vigne R. Spire B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9358-9365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Thr96 and Ser165 sites phosphorylated by MAPK were not identified in our previous study, most likely because the unstimulated cell lysates used to generate radioactive peptides for sequencing have a relatively low level of MAPK activity. Consistent with this possibility, two major tryptic phosphopeptides generated from Vif phosphorylated by MAPK (Fig. 5, spots 1 and 2) were barely detectable when Vif was phosphorylatedin vitro by unstimulated cell lysates (15Yang X. Goncalves J. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10121-10129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Ser144, Thr155, and Thr188 are not phosphorylated by MAPK, suggesting that other kinases also phosphorylate Vif in vivo. Consistent with this prediction, two minor kinase bands, in addition to p44 and p42, were detected in in-gel kinase assays using Vif as a substrate, suggesting that Vif is also phosphorylated by other kinases present in cell lysates. Moreover, tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of Vif phosphorylated in vivoshowed two major phosphopeptides that are not phosphorylated by MAPKin vitro (Fig. 5, spots 6 and 7). The functional consequences of Vif phosphorylation remain to be determined. Phosphorylation of Vif may induce a conformational change that is important for its biological activity, modulate its association with a membrane-associated protein (12Simon J.H.M. Fouchier R.A.M. Southerling T.E. Guerra C.B. Grant C.K. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5259-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Goncalves J. Shi B. Yang X. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7196-7204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or promote its interaction with one of the Gag proteins (43Bouyac M. Courcoul M. Bertoia G. Baudat Y. Gabuzda D. Blanc D. Chazal N. Boulanger P. Sire J. Vigne R. Spire B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9358-9365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a cellular protein, thereby affecting virus assembly. Alternatively, phosphorylation might affect the incorporation of Vif into HIV-1 virions (44Liu H. Wu X. Newman M. Shaw G.M. Hahn B.H. Kappes J.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7630-7638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Karczewski M.K. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 494-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specificity and biological importance of Vif incorporation into virions remain to be determined (46Camaur D. Trono D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6106-6111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Fouchier R.A.M. Simon J.H.M. Jaffe A.B. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8263-8269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).An unexpected finding in this study was the demonstration that MAPK can phosphorylate Vif at sites other than the known consensus sequences. The optimum consensus sequence for substrate phosphorylation by MAPK is PX(S/T)P, as determined by analysis of synthetic peptides as MAPK substrates (35Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The minimum consensus required for MAPK phosphorylation is reported to be (S/T)P, although this motif is suboptimal compared with PX(S/T)P (31Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies, our data show that the sites in Vif phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro and in vivo do not correspond to any of the known consensus sequences. Moreover, the sequence of HIV-1 Vif does not contain any PX(S/T)P motifs. Although Vif has several (S/T)P motifs, these sites are not the major sites of phosphorylation by MAPK. Interestingly, synthetic peptides corresponding to the local sequences of phosphorylation sites in Vif were not phosphorylated by MAPK, suggesting that these sites serve as MAPK substrates only within the context of the full-length protein. Consistent with these findings, not all synthetic peptide substrates corresponding to local phosphorylation sites are phosphorylated with the same kinetics as the full-length protein (48Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.J. Kemp B.E. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 265-291Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that a three-dimensional structure that includes Vif sequences outside the phosphorylation site is required for recognition and phosphorylation of Vif by MAPK. Consistent with the observation that the MAPK phosphorylation sites in Vif did not correspond to the optimum consensus sequences, we found that the phosphorylation rate for Vif was lower than that for MBP, one of the best MAPK substrates. In addition, the K m for Vif phosphorylation by MAPK was approximately 1.6 μm, which is 10-fold lower than that for MBP (17.5 μm) (33Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M.M. Hu C. Lin T-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the kinetic binding affinity between Vif and MAPK is likely to be high. This finding and the demonstration that MAPK is associated with soluble cytoplasmic, membrane, and cytoskeleton fractions, a subcellular distribution pattern similar to that of Vif (12Simon J.H.M.

Virol. 1996; 70: 494-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raises the possibility that Vif may directly interact with MAPK. However, we were not able to demonstrate a direct interaction between Vif and MAPK by co-immunoprecipitation. 2X. Yang and D. Gabuzda, unpublished observations.Our studies suggest that MAPK phosphorylates and activates Vif but do not exclude the possibility that MAPK may also affect other steps of the virus life cycle. Several steps of the HIV-1 virus life cycle depend on cellular activation by mitogenic stimuli (16McCune J.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For example, virus replication is blocked in quiescent T cells due to incomplete reverse transcription and lack of proviral DNA integration (49Zack J.A. Arrigo S.J. Weitsman S.R. Go A.S. Haislip A. Chen I.S.Y. Cell. 1990; 61: 213-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Stimulation with mitogens allows reverse transcription to proceed to completion and allows subsequent virus replication to occur. Mitogenic stimulation can also activate viral gene expression in latently infected cells that harbor integrated proviral DNA (16McCune J.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We found that the infectivity of HIV-1 virions and subsequent virus replication is enhanced by treatment of cells with MAPK stimulators such as serum and PMA and inhibited by PD098059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK activation.2 We have also shown that the HIV-1 Rev, Tat, and p17 Gag proteins can be phosphorylated by recombinant p42 MAPK or by immunoprecipitated MAPK in vitro.2 However, whether these HIV-1 proteins are phosphorylated by MAPK in vivo remains to be determined. A previous study suggested that MAPK may be associated with HIV-1 virions (50Cartier C. Deckert M. Grangeasse C. Trauger R. Jensen F. Bernard A. Cozzone A. Desgranges C. Boyer V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these observations raise the possibility that MAPK may also regulate HIV-1 replication by other mechanisms that are independent of Vif. For example, MAPK may interact with and phosphorylate other HIV-1 proteins (51Greenway A. Azad A. Mills J. McPhee D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6701-6708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or regulate virion-associated kinases (52Gallay P. Swingler S. Aiken C. Trono D.

In addition, the Ras-Raf pathway is activated in HIV-infected monocytes and participates in the activation of NF-κB (57Folgueira L. Algeciras A. MacMorran W.S. Bren G.D. Paya C.V. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2332-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a key regulator of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (58Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). MAPK is a key component of the Ras-Raf pathway and may therefore play a direct role in the activation of NF-κB in HIV-1-infected cells. The HIV-1 virus life cycle may also be regulated by other members of the MAPK family. For example, p38 MAPK has been shown to activate the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (59Kumar S. Orsini M.J. Lee J.C. McDonnell P.C. Debouck C. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30864-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and appears to be required for HIV-1 replication in T cells (60Cohen P.S. Schmidtmayerova Y. Dennis J. Dubrovsky L. Sherry B. Wang H. Bukrinsky M. Tracey K.J. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 339-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the signal transduction pathways that activate HIV-1 replication in response to mitogens and extracellular stimuli may provide new insights into pathogenic mechanisms involved in AIDS and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies. The Vif protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 and other lentiviruses is essential for virus replication in peripheral blood T lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo (1Gabuzda D.H.

https://openalex.org/W2125476541,"Although purinergic compounds are widely involved in the intra- and intercellular communication of the nervous system, little is known of their involvement in the growth and regeneration of neuronal connections. In dissociated cultures, the addition of adenosine or guanosine in the low micromolar range induced goldfish retinal ganglion cells to extend lengthy neurites and express the growth-associated protein GAP-43. These effects were highly specific and did not reflect conversion of the nucleosides to their nucleotide derivatives; pyrimidines, purine nucleotides, and membrane-permeable, nonhydrolyzable cyclic nucleotide analogs were all inactive. The activity of adenosine required its conversion to inosine, because inhibitors of adenosine deaminase rendered adenosine inactive. Exogenously applied inosine and guanosine act directly upon an intracellular target, which may coincide with a kinase described in PC12 cells. In support of this, the effects of the purine nucleosides were blocked with purine transport inhibitors and were inhibited competitively with the purine analog 6-thioguanine (6-TG). In PC12 cells, others have shown that 6-TG blocks nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth and selectively inhibits the activity of protein kinase N, a partially characterized, nerve growth factor-inducible serine-threonine kinase. In both goldfish and rat retinal ganglion cells, 6-TG completely blocked outgrowth induced by other growth factors, and this inhibition was reversed with inosine. These results suggest that axon outgrowth in central nervous system neurons critically involves an intracellular purine-sensitive mechanism.

Under normal circumstances, neurons in the adult mammalian central nervous system fail to regenerate axons injured by stroke or trauma, resulting in long lasting disabilities in sensory, motor, or cognitive functions. However, many central nervous system neurons have the potential to regrow their axons if exposed to appropriate growth factors and/or if inhibitory influences that normally prevail in the mature central nervous system are suppressed (1So K.-F. Aguayo A.J. Brain Res. 1985; 328: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 2Schnell L. Schneider R. Kolbeck R. Barde Y.A. Schwab M.E.

To identify factors that foster axonal regrowth in the central nervous system, we have turned to the classic model of optic nerve regeneration in lower vertebrates. Following injury to the optic nerve, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)1 in fish and amphibia re-extend axons that synapse upon appropriate central targets within 1–2 months (4Sperry R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). In a dissociated cell culture model of this system, two factors secreted by optic nerve glia were found to be responsible for inducing axon outgrowth from goldfish RGCs (5Schwalb J.M. Boulis N.M. Gu M.-F. Winickoff J. Jackson P.S. Irwin N. Benowitz L.I. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5514-5625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schwalb J.M. Gu M.-F. Stuermer C.A.O. Bastmeyer M. Hu G.-F. Boulis N.M. Irwin N. Benowitz L.I. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The more potent of these, axogenesis factor-1 (AF-1), has a molecular mass <1 kDa and stimulates lengthy axonal outgrowth without altering cell survival. AF-2 is a larger polypeptide that exerts a significant but less pronounced effect than AF-1. The specificity of these effects is demonstrated by the inactivity of a host of polypeptide growth factors or low molecular mass differentiation factors in this system (5Schwalb J.M. Boulis N.M. Gu M.-F. Winickoff J. Jackson P.S. Irwin N. Benowitz L.I. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5514-5625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the role of purines in the regeneration of RGC axons. Although the involvement of purine nucleosides in the intra- and intercellular signaling of the nervous system is well established, their role in axonal outgrowth has not been investigated extensively. Extracellularly, many nerve terminals release adenosine or ATP as cotransmitters that act via P1 or P2 purinergic receptors to mediate changes in ion fluxes and other physiological effects in target cells (7Fredholm B.B. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 76: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 8Williams M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Snyder S.H. Annu.

Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 420-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, purines partially mimic or augment the effects of nerve growth factor (12Braumann T. Jastorff B. Richter-Landsberg C. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 912-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas in sympathetic neurons, adenosine inhibits neurite outgrowth and induces apoptotic cell death (13Wakade T.D. Palmer K.C. McCauley R. Przywara D.A. Wakade A.R. J. Physiol. 1995; 488: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We show here that, in dissociated retinal ganglion cells, inosine and to a lesser extent guanosine act directly upon an intracellular pathway to stimulate axonal outgrowth and expression of the growth-associated protein GAP-43, whereas the purine analog 6-thioguanine acts competitively with these purines to arrest growth. Goldfish (Comet Variety, Mt. Parnell Fisheries, Mt. Parnell, PA), 6–10 cm in length, were dark-adapted, and their retinas were dissected. Retinas were incubated with papain (20 μg/ml) activated with cysteine (2.8 mm) for 30 min at room temperature, and then dissociated by gentle trituration. Repeated cycles of trituration and sedimentation yielded cultures nearly homogeneous in ganglion cells, which are readily identified by their oval shape, phase-bright appearance, size (diameter = 12–25 μm), and extension of 1 or 2 neurites of uniform caliber; these criteria have been verified by retrograde labeling (5Schwalb J.M.

Low density cultures were obtained by plating ∼5 × 103 cells/well in poly-l-lysine coated, 24-well culture dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cells were maintained at 21 °C in a serum-free, defined medium as described (5Schwalb J.M. Boulis N.M. Gu M.-F. Winickoff J. Jackson P.S. Irwin N. Benowitz L.I. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5514-5625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schwalb J.M. Gu M.-F. Stuermer C.A.O. Bastmeyer M. Hu G.-F. Boulis N.M. Irwin N. Benowitz L.I.

Corey D.P. Chun L.L.Y. Neuron. 1988; 1: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Briefly, retinas from postnatal day 8 Sprague-Dawley rats were dissociated enzymatically, and macrophages were removed by incubation with an anti-rat macrophage antibody (Accurate) followed by immunopanning with an anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Ganglion cells were separated from non-adhering cells by immunopanning with an anti-Thy-1 antibody (American Type Culture Collection) and then dislodged with trypsin. RGCs of >95% purity were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in the same medium used for goldfish RGCs except for the addition of 5 μm forskolin to enhance cell viability (16Meyer-Franke A. Laplan M.R. Pfrieger F.W. Barres B.A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 805-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) and 26 mm bicarbonate. Based upon other studies (17Jo, S. A., Wang, E., and Benowitz, L. (1997)Neuroscience, in pressGoogle Scholar), stimulation of growth by recombinant rat ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 20 ng/ml, Promega, Madison, WI) was used as a positive control. Samples were plated in quadruplicate in randomized positions of a 24-well plate. To ensure that scoring was conducted blind, the code was concealed until experiments were completed. All experiments included 4 wells of a negative (defined medium only) and a positive control (partially purified AF-1, 20–30% concentration). Growth and survival were assessed after 6 days by examining 15–25 consecutive fields of each well using phase contrast microscopy (at 400× magnification, ∼150 ganglion cells/well). Extension of a process at least 5 cell diameters in length was used as our criterion for outgrowth (5Schwalb J.M. Boulis N.M. Gu M.-F. Winickoff J. Jackson P.S. Irwin N. Benowitz L.I. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5514-5625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Means and standard errors were calculated (Cricket Graph, CA Associates, Islandia, NY), and data were normalized by subtracting the growth in the negative controls (usually 4–5%) and dividing by the net growth in the positive controls. In the most favorable experiments, >50% of RGCs exposed to AF-1 for 6 days extended axons at least 5 cell diameters in length, and many were several hundred microns in length. At longer intervals, almost all AF-1-treated ganglion cells extend lengthy axons. 2B. Petrausch and L. Benowitz, unpublished data. Group comparisons reported here are based upon pairwise, two-tailed Student'st tests. Several independent experiments were performed for all samples. In some cases, cell viability was assessed using the vital dye 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate. For this, medium was replaced just prior to counting with a 0.005% (w/v) solution of carboxyfluorescein diacetate in PBS for 5 min. Cells were rinsed with PBS, and the fluorescent reaction product was visualized under UV illumination. Survival is reported as the number of viable RGCs/400× field. Experiments using rat RGCs were carried out in a similar fashion except that cells were fixed and counted after 2 days. Outgrowth is reported as the fold increase in growth relative to negative controls. Adenosine, AMP, adenosine deaminase (ADA), ADP, ATP, 8-bromo 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate, cAMP, cGMP, cytidine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, inosine, 5′-inosine monophosphate, α-tocopherol, 6-thioguanine (6-TG), thymidine, and uridine were from Sigma. 8-p-Sulfophenyl-theophylline, dibutyryl cAMP, and deoxycoformycin (DCF) were from Calbiochem; 2-chloroadenosine (2-CA) and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine were from Research Biochemicals, Inc. (Natick, MA); and 4-(nitrobenzyl-6-thioinosine) (NBTI) was from Aldrich. Membrane-permeable, nonhydrolyzable analogs of cAMP and of cGMP were from Biolog. The specific inhibitor to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 and -2 (MEK-1 and -2), PD 098059, and the inhibitor to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, LY 294002, were from Sigma. In experiments using these, RGCs were pretreated with inhibitors overnight prior to introducing growth factors. Thereafter, half the medium was changed daily for 5 days to maintain high concentrations of growth factors and inhibitors. Because PD 098059 and LY 294002 were prepared in Me2SO, positive and negative controls contained Me2SO at the concentration required to solubilize the drugs (0.6% final). Recombinant GAP-43 was made by transforming Escherichia coli with a zebrafish cDNA isolated by Dr. Eva Reinhard (18Reinhard E. Nedivi E. Wegner J. Skene J.H.P. Westerfield M. Development. 1994; 120: 1757-1775Google Scholar) subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pTrcHisB (Invitrogen). The protein was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and used to immunize rabbits. Prior to use, nonspecific binding of the antiserum was reduced by diluting it 1:1000 in 50 mm PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and reacting it at 4 °C with a 1 × 14-cm strip of a Western blot on nitrocellulose membrane containing ∼200 μg of proteins from goldfish internal organs separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specificity of the pre-adsorbed antibody is demonstrated on Western blots, where it reacts only with a 48-kDa band that is enriched in retinal ganglion cells undergoing regeneration (see below). Immunostaining was carried out in cultured neurons fixed in methanol (10 min, 4 °C) and reacted overnight (4 °C) with the immune serum prepared as described above or with non-immune serum. Cells were washed with PBS (3 × 10 min), reacted with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno Research; 1:500 in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin), and washed three times. For Western blots, ∼106goldfish retinal cells were grown in 100-mm dishes in control medium, AF-1 (30%), or inosine (50 μm) for 6 days. Cells were collected and centrifuged, and 50 μg of protein from each was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14% acrylamide), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (200 mA, 15 h, 4 °C), and probed for GAP-43 in a procedure similar to that used for immunocytochemistry except for the use of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In agreement with previous findings (5Schwalb J.M. Boulis N.M. Gu M.-F. Winickoff J. Jackson P.S. Irwin N. Benowitz L.I. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5514-5625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,6Schwalb J.M.

Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), AF-1, a low molecular mass growth factor secreted by optic nerve glia, stimulated extensive outgrowth from goldfish retinal ganglion cells (Fig. 1 a); controls maintained in the absence of AF-1 remained quiescent (Fig. 1 b). At 100 μm, adenosine and guanosine stimulated considerable outgrowth (Fig. 1 c), whereas the pyrimidines cytidine, uridine, and thymidine had no activity. These results are shown quantitatively in Fig. 2 a, with data normalized by the net growth in AF-1-treated positive controls. A more complete dose-response curve (Fig. 2 b) shows that at 50–100 μm adenosine induces a response 60% of that stimulated by AF-1 but that outgrowth decreases at higher concentrations. Based upon 10 independent experiments, the EC50 for adenosine was calculated to be 11.7 ± 1.3 μm (mean ± S.E.). Guanosine was less potent (EC50 = 32.4 ± 13.2 μm, based upon five experiments), but at concentrations above 100 μm, it stimulated the same maximal level of outgrowth as adenosine, with no decrease in activity at higher concentrations. None of these agents altered cell survival (see below, Fig. 3 c).Figure 2Effects of nucleosides and nucleotides on axonal outgrowth: quantitation. a, the nucleosides adenosine (Ado), guanosine (Guo), cytidine (Cyt), uridine (Uri), and thymidine (Thy) were bioassayed at 1, 10, and 100 μm. Data were normalized by subtracting the level of growth in negative controls and then dividing by the net growth in positive controls (AF-1, 25% concentration). b, dose-response curves for adenosine and guanosine. EC50 values estimated from these and other experiments are 11.4 ± 1.3 μm for adenosine and 32.4 ± 13.2 μm for guanosine (mean ± S.E.). c, effects of adenosine nucleotides.d, effects of membrane-permeable analogs of cyclic AMP (dibutyryl cAMP (dB cAMP) and 8-bromoadenosine-3′,5′ cyclic monophosphorothioate (Sp-8Br cAMPs)) or cyclic GMP (8-bromo cyclic GMP (8-Br cGMP) and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-pcpt-cGMP).

Lanes 1–6, outgrowth stimulated by AF-1, 100 μm adenosine (Ado), or 100 μm guanosine (Guo) is unaffected by the addition of 20 μm8-p-sulfophenyl-theophylline (8-PST), an inhibitor of A1 and A2 adenosine receptors (compare growth in lane 1 versus lane 2, lane 3 versus lane 4, and lane 5 versus lane 6). Lane 7, the nonhydrolyzable adenosine analog 2-CA (100 μm) diminishes outgrowth below base-line levels (p < 0.001 in three experiments). b and c, effects of DCF and exogenous ADA on outgrowth and survival. Whereas augmenting adenosine hydrolysis with exogenous ADA leaves the activity of adenosine unaltered (b, lane 6), blocking endogenous ADA activity with DCF causes adenosine to suppress growth (b, lane 5) and survival (c, lane 5). The effect of ADA on guanosine was not tested. ***,p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) cAMP and ATP at concentrations of 1–100 μm had no effect on outgrowth (Fig. 2 c). AMP and ADP were both inactive at 1 and 10 μm but showed slight activity at 100 μm(p = 0.05). These results make it unlikely that the purine nucleosides are acting as precursors to nucleotides that stimulate P2 purinergic receptors (10Burnstock G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 11Zimmermann H. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 420-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the purines could serve as precursors for cyclic nucleotides that act as second messengers to stimulate outgrowth. However, nonhydrolyzable, membrane-permeable analogs of cAMP (8-bromoadenosine-3′,5′ cyclic monophosphorothioate) and of cGMP (8-(4-chlorophenylthio) guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate) were inactive even at concentrations up to 1 mm (Fig. 2 d). Two other cyclic nucleotide analogs, dibutyryl cAMP and 8-bromo-cGMP, likewise showed no activity (Fig. 2 d). As with the nucleosides and other nucleotides, none of the cyclic nucleotides affected cell survival (data not shown). The two most common adenosine receptors (A1 and A2) are effectively blocked with 20 μm 8-p-sulfophenyl-theophylline (19Collis M.G. Jacobson K.A. Tomkins D.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 92: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,20Schäfer K.-H. Saffrey M.J. Burnstock G. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, this concentration of 8-p-sulfophenyl-theophylline had no effect on outgrowth stimulated by adenosine or guanosine (Fig. 3 a, lanes 4 and 6). A further indication that adenosine is not inducing growth through extracellular adenosine receptors comes from studies using the non-hydrolyzable analog, 2-CA, which acts as an agonist at the A1, A2, and A3receptors (21Sajjadi F.G. Takabayashi K. Foster A.C. Domingo R.C. Firestein G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3435-3442PubMed Google Scholar). At 10 and 100 μm, 2-CA actually caused growth to decline below base line (Fig. 3 a, lane 7; decline significant at p < 0.001). The previous results indicate that adenosine must be metabolized to be active. Adenosine is converted to inosine by ADA (22Geiger J.D. Nagy J.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2702-2714Crossref Google Scholar), and we therefore investigated the effects of inhibiting this enzyme with either DCF (10 μm) or erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (10 μm). In the presence of DCF, 100 μmadenosine caused growth to decline below base line (Fig. 3 b, lane 5 versus lane 4: p < 0.01) and impaired cell survival (Fig. 3 c, lane 5 versus lane 4: p < 0.001). These effects can be attributed specifically to nonhydrolyzed adenosine and did not occur when DCF was used alone, with AF-1, or with guanosine (Fig. 3, b and c, lanes 2 and 8). Like DCF, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine prevented 100 μmadenosine from stimulating growth and caused cell survival to decline by 30% (data not shown). Further evidence that the effects of adenosine require its hydrolysis comes from experiments in which we added exogenous ADA. At 0.4 unit/ml, ADA failed to diminish axon growth stimulated by 100 μm adenosine (Fig. 3 b, lane 6) and had no effect on survival. As anticipated, inosine, the primary product of adenosine deamination, was a potent activator of axon outgrowth. The EC50 for inosine was estimated to be 11.4 ± 1.4 μm (average from seven experiments), and a maximal response equal to about 60% the level stimulated by AF-1 was attained at concentrations of 50 μm (Fig. 4 a). Unlike adenosine, increasing the concentration of inosine up to 1 mm did not cause growth to decline. Metabolic hydrolysis of inosine yields hypoxanthine, which was inactive. Inosine 5′ monophosphate had no effect at 10 μm but showed modest activity at 100 μm (Fig. 4 a). Two inhibitors of purine transport, NBTI and dipyridamole, were used to investigate whether inosine and guanosine must be transported into neurons to stimulate growth. At 20 μm, NBTI prevented both nucleosides from stimulating outgrowth (Fig. 4 b, lanes 4 and 6 versus lanes 3 and 5, respectively; p < 0.01) but had little effect on AF-1-induced growth (lanes 1, 2). Dipyridamole (10 μm) likewise blocked the effects of inosine completely (p < 0.01; guanosine not tested). The cultures used here contain 70–90% ganglion cells, with the remainder representing other neural and non-neuronal elements of the retina (5Schwalb J.M. Boulis N.M. Gu M.-F. Winickoff J. Jackson P.S. Irwin N. Benowitz L.I. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5514-5625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Schwartz M. Agranoff B.W. Brain Res. 1981; 206: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity raises the possibility that inosine or guanosine could act upon another cell type that secretes a secondary factor that stimulates RGCs. In this case, the effect of the purines would vary with cell density, because the concentration of any secondary factor should decrease as cell density declines. However, the level of outgrowth stimulated by either 100 μm inosine or 100 μm guanosine remained unchanged over a 10-fold density range, down to 5 cells/mm2 (data not shown). A hallmark of optic nerve regenerationin vivo is the dramatic up-regulation in expression of the phosphoprotein, GAP-43 (23Benowitz L.I. Lewis E. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Heacock A.M. Agranoff B. Neurochem. Res. 1982; 7: 771-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25LaBate M.E. Skene J.H.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 299-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To investigate whether purine nucleoside stimulation mimics this up-regulation, we carried out immunohistochemistry using an antiserum against zebrafish GAP-43. As shown in Fig. 5 (c, e, and g), AF-1, inosine, and guanosine all dramatically altered GAP-43 expression relative to negative controls. This is also evident on Western blots (5 h). In a semi-quantitative analysis, we rated the level of GAP-43 immunoreactivity from 0 (none) to 3 (intense) and correlated staining intensity with the length of the axon of the cell (150–200 cells/condition). Inosine produced a highly significant increase in the number of cells with intensity >1 (χ2 = 18.4; p < 0.0001), and the intensity of GAP-43 immunostaining was correlated with axon length (r = 0.544; p < 0.0001). Appreciable levels of immunostaining were seen in 100% of inosine-treated cells having axons >5 cell diameters in length but in only 21% of inosine-treated cells with axons <5 cell diameters in length. In PC12 cells and peripheral neurons, the purine analog 6-TG selectively blocks NGF-induced differentiation but not survival (26Volonte C. Rukenstein A. Loeb D.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2395-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Greene L.A. Volonte C. Chalazonitis A. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1479-1485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, 6-TG (10 μm) completely blocked AF-1-stimulated outgrowth in goldfish RGCs (Figs. 1 d and 6 a, lane 2; p < 0.001) with no effect on cell survival (Fig. 6 b, lane 2). This concentration of 6-TG reduced outgrowth stimulated by 25 μm inosine by only 50% (Fig. 6 a, lanes 4 versus lane 3) and had no effect on growth stimulated by 100 μm inosine (or 100 μm guanosine; Figs. 1 g and 6 a, lanes 5–8). At 100 μm, inosine restored the growth induced by AF-1 in the presence of 10 μm 6-TG back to its original level (Figs. 1 h and Fig. 6 a, lane 10 versus lane 9), which is significantly above the level induced by inosine alone (Fig. 6 a, lane 10 versus lane 6, p < 0.01). In additional studies, higher concentrations of 6-TG (200 μm) completely blocked growth induced by 50 μm inosine, whereas decreasing concentrations of the inhibitor had progressively less of an effect (data not shown). Thus, inosine and 6-TG appear to compete for the same target molecule, and both of these modulate the effects of the endogenous growth factor AF-1. Because 6-TG has a free thiol, it could be acting by nonspecific redox effects rather than as a purine analog. To test this possibility, we used a free radical scavenger, α-tocopherol (30 μm), and glutathione α-methyl ester (100 μm). Unlike 6-TG, these agents had no effect on outgrowth stimulated by AF-1 (Fig. 6 d). Another question was whether inosine might block the inhibitory effect of 6-TG on outgrowth by interfering with its transport into cells. This was investigated by examining whether the two transport inhibitors that block the positive effects of inosine would also block the negative effects of 6-TG. Neither NBTI (20 μm) nor dipyridamole (10 μm) prevented 6-TG from blocking outgrowth stimulated by AF-1 (Fig. 6 d). Retinal ganglion cells, purified to homogeneity from 8-day-old rats, showed a modest level of spontaneous growth when grown in defined medium for 2 days (Fig. 7 a). Inosine at 25 μm stimulated a 52% increase in outgrowth (p < 0.002 compared with controls; Fig. 7,b and c, lane 2) but failed to alter cell survival (Fig. 7 d). A similar effect was seen with 50 μm inosine, whereas 10 μm was ineffective (not shown). CNTF induced a 3-fold increase in outgrowth over control levels (Fig. 7 c, lane 3; cf. Ref. 17Jo, S. A., Wang, E., and Benowitz, L. (1997)Neuroscience, in pressGoogle Scholar) and enhanced survival significantly. 10 μm 6-TG blocked CNTF-induced outgrowth but did not prevent CNTF from enhancing cell survival (Fig. 7, c and d, lane 5). The addition of 50 μm inosine restored a high level of outgrowth to CNTF-treated cells exposed to 6-TG (Fig. 7 c, lane 6). In PC12 cells, activation of MEK-1 and/or MEK-2 is necessary and sufficient to induce neurite outgrowth (28Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 29Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4235) Google Scholar). Conversely, PD 098059, which acts as a highly specific inhibitor of MEK-1/-2 activation (30Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar,32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar), blocks NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells (31Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20713-20718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). At 50 μm, PD 098059 blocked ∼50% of the outgrowth induced by 100 μm inosine (p < 0.001) but did not alter the effects of AF-1 (Fig. 8; similar results obtained in five separate experiments). PD 098059 at 25 μm was equally effective in blocking growth stimulated by inosine, whereas at 100 μm, it had a stronger effect on growth but also affected cell survival (data not shown). NGF signaling in PC12 cells also activates PI 3-kinase (33Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and inhibitors of this pathway also affect differentiation (34Kimamuara K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LY 294002, a potent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (35Miller T.M. Tansey M.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. Creedon D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9847-9853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), showed similar effects as PD 098059, inhibiting about half the activity of 100 μminosine (p < 0.002) without affecting growth stimulated by AF-1 (Fig. 8). The combination of PD 098059 plus LY 294002 completely blocked outgrowth stimulated by inosine (p < 0.001) but only partially diminished growth stimulated by AF-1 (loss significant at p < 0.002). These results show that the purine nucleosides inosine and guanosine act through an intracellular mechanism to stimulate axonal outgrowth and GAP-43 expression in retinal ganglion cells. Inosine is the more potent of the two, perhaps because it preferentially activates one or more intracellular target(s) or perhaps because it is more readily converted to another active metabolite. It is clear that the nucleosides are not acting primarily as precursors to the cyclic nucleotides, however, because membrane-permeant, nonhydrolyzable analogs of cAMP and cGMP were inactive. The principle product of inosine hydrolysis, hypoxanthine, was likewise ineffective in causing growth, and hence the biologically active agent may be inosineper se. In other cell types, inosine acting through an intracellular mechanism has been shown to prevent cell death in astrocytes (36Haun S.E. Segeleon J.E. Trapp V.L. Clotz M.A. Horrocks L.A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2051-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and to evoke relaxation of the aorta (37Collis M.G. Palmer D.B. Baxter G.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 121: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, inosine was shown to be the principal factor in liver conditioned medium that stimulates differentiation in chick sympathetic neurons (38Zurn A.D. Do K.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The intracellular target of inosine may coincide with a purine-sensitive kinase that has been implicated in mediating NGF-induced differentiation. In PC12 cells and in sensory and sympathetic neurons, the purine analog 6-TG blocks NGF-induced neurite outgrowth without affecting survival (26Volonte C. Rukenstein A. Loeb D.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2395-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Greene L.A. Volonte C. Chalazonitis A. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1479-1485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Research into the mechanism of action of 6-TG has shown that it selectively inhibits an NGF-activated, 45–47-kDa serine-threonine kinase, protein kinase N (39Volonte C. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21663-21670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Batistatou A. Volonte C. Greene L.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), that remains to be characterized further. In the present study, a competition between inosine and 6-TG was evident; whereas outgrowth stimulated by a nearly saturating level of inosine was partially blocked by 6-TG at 10 μm, outgrowth induced by higher concentrations of inosine (or guanosine) was not. However, increasing the concentration of 6-TG progressively inhibited the activity of higher concentrations of inosine. Hence, inosine may be acting as an agonist at the same site at which 6-TG acts as an antagonist, i.e. protein kinase N. The structural similarities among inosine, guanosine, and 6-TG would be consistent with a common site of action. Growth induced by the endogenous low molecular mass factor AF-1 was more robust than by inosine and was more resistant to disruption by inhibitors of MEK-1/-2 and PI 3-kinase. Growth induced by inosine was reduced by half with the MEK-1/-2 inhibitor PD 098059 or by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 and was blocked completely by the combination of the two. In contrast, growth induced by AF-1 was unaffected by either inhibitor alone and still remained high in the presence of the two combined. On the other hand, growth stimulated by AF-1 was completely blocked by 6-TG, whereas inosine seemed to work competitively with 6-TG and restored AF-1-activated growth back to its original level in the presence of the inhibitor. One interpretation of these results is that growth stimulated by AF-1 and by inosine is transduced through protein kinase N but that AF-1 activates additional downstream pathways besides MEK-1/-2 and PI 3-kinase. Axon outgrowth in mammalian RGCs also appears to utilizes a purine-sensitive mechanism, because inosine stimulated some degree of outgrowth by itself and reversed the inhibition of CNTF-induced outgrowth by 6-TG. Throughout these studies, AF-1, inosine, nor 6-TG had any effect on cell survival. A similar dissociation between intracellular signaling pathways leading to survival versus outgrowth is well documented for other cell types (27Greene L.A. Volonte C. Chalazonitis A. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1479-1485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4235) Google Scholar, 30Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). In vivo, optic nerve regeneration is marked by an increase in ganglion cells' expression of the membrane phosphoprotein GAP-43 (23Benowitz L.I. Lewis E. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Heacock A.M. Agranoff B. Neurochem. Res. 1982; 7: 771-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25LaBate M.E. Skene J.H.P.

Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). In goldfish RGCs, purines and AF-1 both stimulated GAP-43 expression, thus mimicking at least one aspect of the molecular changes that underlie axonal regeneration in vivo. In preliminary studies, inosine also strongly stimulated promoter activity for α-1 tubulin 3N. Irwin, A. Taghinia, D. Goldman, and L. Benowitz, unpublished data. and up-regulated expression of the cell adhesion molecule L1, 4R. Petrausch, C. Stuermer, and L. Benowitz, unpublished data. both of which are activated by regeneration in vivo. Adenosine was active only when hydrolyzed to inosine. The nonhydrolyzable adenosine analog 2-CA failed to induce growth, whereas inhibiting the hydrolysis of adenosine itself led to diminished cell survival. Thus, the failure of adenosine to inhibit growth may be secondary to its effects on cell survival. Adenosine has previously been shown to induce apoptotic cell death in sensory neurons (13Wakade T.D. Palmer K.C. McCauley R. Przywara D.A. Wakade A.R. J. Physiol. 1995; 488: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and to inhibit in vitro regeneration of the frog sciatic nerve (42Edstöm A. Edbladh M. Ekström P. Brain Res. 1992; 570: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, adenosine and its nucleotide derivatives potentiated NGF-induced outgrowth (12Braumann T. Jastorff B. Richter-Landsberg C. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 912-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, because inosine also had a positive effect in that study and because adenosine deaminase was not inhibited, it is possible that the stimulatory effects of the adenosine compounds all ultimately reflect the action of inosine. Positive effects of guanosine on neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells have also been reported recently (43Gysbers J.W. Rathbone M.P. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 220: 175-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study, pyrimidine nucleosides had no effect on outgrowth, whereas the purine nucleotides showed only low levels of activity. Catabolic enzymes that rapidly convert cAMP, ATP, ADP, and AMP to adenosine are present extracellularly in cultured neurons (12Braumann T. Jastorff B. Richter-Landsberg C. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 912-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 44Tolkovsky A.M. Suidan H.S. Neuroscience. 1987; 23: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 45Wolinsky E.J.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7673-7682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the low levels of activity found for 5′ inosine monophosphate, 5′ AMP, and ADP may therefore reflect their conversion to inosine. Adenosine, inosine, and guanosine coexist intracellularly, and it is even possible that purine nucleosides might act as second messengers in regulating the neuron's growth state. It will be of interest to identify the intracellular target(s) of the purines, whether it is protein kinase N or another molecule, and to characterize in detail the pathways that lead to axon growth.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 is an essential component of the Gram-negative bacterial cell surface. It forms the major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and, as such, plays an integral role in the interaction of the bacterium with the surrounding environment. The basic structure of LPS can be divided into three regions. From the outer membrane of the cell outward, these are the following: (i) a hydrophobic lipid component (lipid A), which anchors the LPS molecule in the outer membrane; (ii) a core oligosaccharide (core OS) consisting of 10–15 sugars; and (iii) a structurally diverse O-polysaccharide (O-PS), which provides an extended and hydrophilic cell surface layer that aids in resistance to complement-mediated serum killing. In theEnterobacteriaceae, the core OS is divided into two structural regions, an inner core region, which contains 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid and heptose, and an outer core region, which consists primarily of hexose and acetamido sugars. The inner core is highly conserved among Gram-negative enteric bacteria, while the outer core region shows diversity with respect to the type of sugars present and the linkages by which they are joined. There are five different core OS structures described in Escherichia coli (designated K-12, R1, R2, R3, and R4). All E. coli core OSs have three outer core hexose residues designated HexI, -II, and -III, where HexI is the first residue of the outer core OS. The structures of the outer core OSs of E. coli R1 and E. coli R4 are shown in Fig. 1 A. Of the five recognized E. coli outer core OS structures, the R1 and R4 types are most closely related to one another, differing by only a single sugar residue in an equivalent position. This difference lies in the branch substitution at the HexII position of the outer core OS backbone. Specifically, the second Glc (HexII) of the outer core OS backbone is substituted by β-linked Glcp in R1 and β-linked Galp in R4. These two core OS types share a common terminal disaccharide moiety (α-d-Galp-(1→2)-α-d-Galp) which is not found in E. coli K-12, R2, or R3 core types. Lipid A-core and O-PSs are formed by independent assembly pathways (1Whitfield C. Amor P.A. Köplin R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2Schnaitman C.A.

The core OS biosynthesis, or waa(formerly known as rfa), region is located near 81 min on the E. coli K-12 linkage map and contains genes that are required for assembly of the K-12 core OS. Many of the genes at this locus are thought to encode glycosyltransferases that sequentially elongate the core OS on a lipid A acceptor molecule.

Most of the genes in these operons have homologs where predicted products are highly conserved (greater than 70% total similarity) in all three organisms. The R1 core OS structure is the most prevalent among clinical isolates of E. coli (7Appelmelk B.J. An Y.-Q. Hekker T.A.M. Thijs L.G. MacLaren D.M. de Graaf J.

Typhimurium has been hampered by the lack of precisely defined mutations and structural determination of mutant LPSs. This study addresses the assembly of the outer region of the R1 and R4 core types by analyzing the chemical structure of precisely defined insertion mutations within the core OS biosynthesis gene cluster. In this manner, we make definitive assignments of the functions of genes within the core OS biosynthesis operon. Given that there are unique side-branch substituents present within the outer core region of the R1 and R4 core OS types (i.e. sugars and linkages that are not present in any of the other characterizedE. coli or S. enterica sv. Typhimurium core OS types), we identify two novel genes that influence the key determinants of these two LPS core types. In addition, we characterize a third gene, shared by the R1 and R4 core OS biosynthesis regions but not by otherE. coli core OS biosynthesis regions, whose product defines the terminal α-d-Galp-(1→2)-α-d-Galpdisaccharide that is common to only the R1 and R4 core OS structures. Finally, we identify the sugar residue that provides the attachment site for lipid A-core-linked polysaccharides to an R1-type core OS molecule. The location of the attachment site is different from that predicted based on the characterized attachment site in E. coli R2 (9Gamian A. Romanowska E. Ulrich J. Defaye J. Carbohydr.

Open table in a new tab Bacterial strains were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (11Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press, Plainview, New York1992Google Scholar) at 37 °C, unless otherwise stated. Growth medium was supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), gentamicin (15 μg/ml), or tetracycline (10 μg/ml) as necessary. l-Arabinose was used at a final concentration of 0.02% for growth and induction of strains containing pBAD24 derivatives. General methods for manipulation and computer analysis of DNA are as outlined previously (5Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8849-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a Perkin-Elmer 394 DNA synthesizer and sequencing was performed using an ABI 377 DNA sequencing apparatus (Perkin-Elmer) in the Guelph Molecular Supercentre at the University of Guelph. PCR amplification was performed using a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 from Perkin-Elmer. The Expand high fidelity enzyme mix (Boehringer Mannheim) was used as the polymerase enzyme in PCR reactions where products were greater than 5 kb. For generation of products of less than 5 kb in size, PwoI DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) was used. PCR amplification of the chromosomal region flanked by thewaaC and waaA genes was performed as follows: (i) one initial cycle at 94 °C for 1 min; (ii) 20 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s and 68 °C for 12 min; (iii) 16 auto cycles at 94 °C for 15 s and 68 °C for 12 min, with an autoextension at 68 °C for 15 s/cycle; (iv) a final cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. Oligonucleotide primers were based upon conserved regions of DNA sequence in the waaC and waaA genes of E. coli K-12 and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium. The sequence of these primers is as follows: (i) forward primer, 5′-ACGTTGCCCGCACTCACTGA-3′, which hybridizes near the 5′-end of waaC and (ii) complementary reverse primer, 5′-TTCGGTGGCAGGTAAGGTTC-3′, which hybridizes near the 3′-end of waaA. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit from Qiagen. To ensure error-free sequencing, the sequence of each of the DNA strands was determined from the product of separate PCR runs. In the rare instances where a mismatch in sequence between strands occurred, a small region surrounding the mismatch was reamplified and sequenced. ThewaaG, -O, -T, -W, -V, and -L genes of the R1 core OS biosynthesis region were independently mutated by insertion of a nonpolar gentamicin resistance cassette (the aacC1 gene from Tn1696). Briefly, each of the genes was individually cloned from PCR-amplified products, and the aacC1 gene (obtained from plasmid pUCGM) was inserted into an appropriate site within the coding region of the specific waa gene (see Fig. 1 C). Mutagenesis of the waaG, -O, -T, -W, and -V genes was performed by insertion of the aacC1gene at a specific site (Fig. 1 C), whereas mutagenesis of the waaL gene was performed by the replacement of a 396-base pair MluI fragment (present within the waaLcoding region) with the aacC1 gene. A fragment containing the insertionally inactivated gene was then cloned into the suicide delivery vector pMAK705, and chromosomal gene replacement was performed as described previously (12Amor P.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To verify phenotypes and the nonpolar nature of single mutations, each derivative of F470 was complemented with a recombinant pBAD24 plasmid carrying the corresponding PCR-amplified individual open reading frame. Small scale LPS preparations were made from SDS-proteinase K whole-cell lysates as described elsewhere (13Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS was separated on 10–20% gradient SDS-Tricine polyacrylamide gels, which were obtained from Novex (San Diego, CA). PAGE conditions were those recommended by the manufacturer, and the silver-staining procedure has been described (14Tsai G.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). Western immunoblotting procedures have been described (12Amor P.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), as has production of polyclonal rabbit α-d-galactan I serum (15Clarke B.R. Bronner D. Keenleyside W.J. Severn W.B. Richards J.C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5411-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS from an equivalent number of cells was loaded in each lane of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For isolation of LPS from CWG303 and CWG308, cells were first washed twice with each of ethanol, acetone, and petroleum ether. No preliminary cell-washing steps were performed on any other strain. Water-soluble LPSs were then obtained by hot water-phenol extraction of cells (16Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar) and treated with 2% acetic acid at 100 °C to cleave the acid-labile ketosidic linkage between the core OS and lipid A. The water-insoluble lipid A was isolated from the hydrolysate as a pellet by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 °C). The supernatant, which contained core OS, was purified on a column of BioGel P-2 (1 m x 1 cm) with water as eluent. Compositional and linkage data were interpreted based upon the previously published structure of the R1 core OS (17Jansson P.-E. Lindberg A.A. Lindberg B. Wollin R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and that of the R4 core OS (17Jansson P.-E. Lindberg A.A. Lindberg B. Wollin R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Feige U. Jann B. Jann K. Schmidt G. Stirm S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 79: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Sugar composition analysis was performed by the alditol acetate method (19Sawardeker J.H. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A. Anal. Chem. 1967; 39: 1602-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds was achieved by using 4 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h. The samples were then reduced in H2O with NaBD4 and acetylated with acetic anhydride using residual sodium acetate as the catalyst. Characterization of the alditol acetate derivatives was performed by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using a Hewlett-Packard chromatograph equipped with a 30 m DB-17 capillary column (210 °C (30 min) to 240 °C at 2 °C/min). Mass spectrometry in the electron impact mode was recorded using a Varian Saturn II mass spectrometer. Linkage analysis was carried out by methylation according to the procedure of Ciucanu and Kerek (20Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3177) Google Scholar). The permethylated alditol acetate derivatives were fully characterized by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in the electron impact mode using a column of DB-17 operated isothermally at 190 °C for 60 min. 1H NMR spectra of the core OSs were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer at 300 K using standard Bruker software. Prior to performing the NMR experiments, the samples were lyophilized three times with D2O (99.9%). The internal reference for 1H NMR was the HOD peak (δH 4.786). The structure of the outer core region of E. coli R1 and R4 LPS molecules is shown in Fig. 1 A. Similarities between the known sequences of the waaA (encodes the 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid transferase) and waaC (encodes the HepI transferase) genes of E. coli K-12 and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium and the highly conserved inner core OS structures led us to assume that similar sequences would also exist in E. coli strains displaying other core OS types. This led to a PCR strategy already used to characterize the E. coli R2 core OS biosynthesis region (5Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8849-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Primers were designed such that the region between the waaAand waaC genes of E. coli F470 (LPS core type R1) and F2513 (LPS core type R4) was amplified. Sequencing of the PCR products indicated that the amplified region from F470 was 11.8 kb in size and that from F2513 was 11.5 kb in size. Both products contain 11 open reading frames. The two regions encode predicted products with high degrees of total similarity in all but two genes (Fig. 1 B). We have established the role of three enzymes, WaaP, WaaQ, and WaaY, in assembly of the heptose region in the Enterobacteriaceae (21Yethon J.A. Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26310-26316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). WaaP phosphorylates the HepI residue in the core OS and is a prerequisite for other modifications by WaaY (phosphorylates HepII) and WaaQ (adds HepIII residue). AwaaL homolog was identified in both the R1 and R4 core OS biosynthesis regions by hydropathy profile similarities between its predicted product and known WaaL proteins of E. coli K-12 (22Klena J.D. Ashford II R.S. Schnaitman C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7297-7307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), R2 (5Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8849-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium (6MacLachlan P.R. Kadam S.K. Sanderson K.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7151-7163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The WaaL protein is the only protein identified to date whose function involves ligation of cell surface polymers to lipid A-core molecules (1Whitfield C. Amor P.A. Köplin R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The core OS from S. enterica sv. Typhimurium as well as all of the E. coli core OS types have a α-d-Glcp-(1→3)-l-glycero-α-d-manno-Hepplinkage, which defines the junction between the outer and inner core OS regions. The product of the waaG gene is involved in the formation of this disaccharide in S. enterica sv. Typhimurium (23Müller E. Hinckley A. Rothfield L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2614-2622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the LPS structure of an E. coli K-12waaG mutant is in agreement with this activity (24Parker C.T. Kloser A.W. Schnaitman C.A. Stein M.A. Gottesman S. Gibson B.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2525-2538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the R1 and R4 core OS biosynthesis regions contain waaGhomologs whose products are virtually identical (99.5% identity) (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, given the conserved nature of the α-d-Glcp-(1→3)-l-glycero-α-d-manno-Hepplinkage among E. coli and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium, all WaaG proteins (i.e. those of E. coli R1, R2, and R4 and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium) share total similarities of greater than 90%. Consistent with the assignment of the R1 and R4 WaaG proteins as UDP-glucose:(heptosyl) LPS α1,3-glucosyltransferases, LPS of strain CWG303 (waaG::aacC1 derivative of F470) migrates faster than F470 LPS in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). Compositional data (not shown) and linkage analysis (Table II) of the methylated CWG303 core OS indicate the absence of hexose sugars in the core OS molecule. Complementation of CWG303 with pWQ903 (which carries the R1 waaG gene) results in an LPS with equivalent mobility to that of F470 in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B).Table IILinkage analysis and approximate molar ratios of residues in the outer core OSs of E. coli F470 and derivativesStrainLinkage typeStructure2-aPredicted outer core OS structure which also indicates the attachment of the outer core OS to the inner core HepII residue.

Open table in a new tab The WaaI protein of S. enterica sv. Typhimurium and the WaaO proteins of E. coli K-12 and R2 are predicted to be HexII glycosyltransferases (5Heinrichs D.E.

The product of the gene designated waaO in the R1 and R4 core OS biosynthesis clusters shares 64% total similarity with the predicted WaaO protein of E. coli K-12 and R2 and 66% total similarity with the WaaI protein of S. enterica sv. Typhimurium. The position of waaO within the core OS biosynthesis region and the similarity of its product to the other putative HexII transferases suggest an involvement in the transfer of the HexII residue of the core OS backbone in R1 LPS core-type strains. The R1 and R4 WaaO proteins contain the consensus sequence features of the WaaIJ family (5Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8849-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) of α-glycosyltransferases (data not shown). Insertional inactivation of the waaO gene of F470 (strain CWG308) results in a truncated LPS molecule that migrates slower in SDS-PAGE than CWG303 LPS (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, linkage data of methylated core OS from CWG308 indicate that the only hexose present is terminal Glcp (Table II). Complementation of CWG308 with pWQ904 (which carries the R1 waaO gene) returns the LPS mobility in SDS-PAGE to that of F470 (Fig. 2 B). These data identify WaaO as the UDP-glucose:(glucosyl) LPS α1,3-glucosyltransferase. Given that the R4 core OS structure predicts an identical HexII transferase activity and that the R4 core OS biosynthesis region contains a virtually identical homolog of the R1 WaaO protein (99.7% amino acid identity) (see Fig. 1 B), the equivalent gene in R4 has also been designated waaO. The transfer of the HexIII residue of the core OS backbone has historically been attributed to the activity of the product of waaJ (formerly rfaJ) in bothS. enterica sv. Typhimurium and E. coli K-12. The nomenclature for the gene involved in this substitution has recently been changed to waaR in E. coli K-12 to differentiate its activity (formation of α-d-Glcp-(1→2)-α-d-Glcp) from that of waaJ (formation of α-d-Glcp-(1→2)-α-d-Galp) in S. enterica sv. Typhimurium (5Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8849-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HexIII addition in the R1 and R4 core OSs involves formation of α-d-Galp-(1→2)-α-d-Glcp, a disaccharide unique to the R1 and R4 core OS structures. The gene encoding the enzyme with this activity is therefore given the unique designation waaT. Tentative assignment of this gene in the R1 and R4 regions was initially based on its position immediately downstream of the gene involved in HexII transfer (as is the case in the S. enterica sv. Typhimurium, E. coli K-12, and E. coli R2 core OS biosynthesis regions). The predicted WaaT proteins of R1 and R4 share 99.4% identity (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, the WaaT proteins share 58% total similarity with the WaaJ protein of S. enterica sv. Typhimurium and 57% total similarity with the WaaR protein of E. coli K-12 and R2. The WaaT proteins also contain the consensus sequence features of the WaaIJ family (5Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8849-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) of α-glycosyltransferases (data not shown). Insertional inactivation of the waaT gene of F470 (strain CWG309) results in a truncated LPS molecule that migrates slower than LPS of CWG308 in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A), and linkage analysis of the methylated CWG309 core OS indicates that CWG309 contains both terminal Glcp and 3-linked Glcp (Table II). Introduction of plasmid pWQ905 (which carries the R1 waaT gene) into CWG309 returns the LPS profile in SDS-PAGE to that of F470 LPS (Fig. 2 B). These data confirm that the waaT gene product is the UDP-galactose:(glucosyl) LPS α1,2-galactosyltransferase, involved in the addition of the HexIII residue of the R1, and by analogy, R4 core OSs. Substitution of the HexIII residue (α-d-Glcp) of the E. coli K-12, R2, and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium core OSs by side branch sugars occurs in the form of GlcpNAc in S. enterica sv. Typhimurium and E. coli R2 (both at carbon 2 of α-d-Glcp), and by a nonstoichiometric β-d-GlcpNAc-(1→7)-α-l-Heppdisaccharide at carbon 6 of α-d-Glcp in E. coli K-12 (27Brade L. Grimmecke H.-D.

https://openalex.org/W2164098611,"We have shown that, in murine J774 macrophages, binding of UTP to pyrimidinoceptors stimulates phosphoinositide (PI) breakdown and an increase in [Ca2+]i. In this study, UTP modulation of the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) was investigated. Although UTP alone had no effect, stimulation of J774 cells with a combination of UTP (10–300 μm) and LPS (0.1–3 μg/ml) resulted in a potentiated increase in nitrite levels. In parallel, the amount of iNOS protein induced by LPS was also potentiated by UTP treatment. The UTP potentiating effect was attenuated by U73122, suggesting involvement of the downstream signaling pathways of phosphatidylinositide turnover. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein inhibited both the LPS-induced nitrite response and the UTP potentiation. Conversely, two protein kinase C inhibitors, Ro 31-8220 and Go 6976, and a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C inhibitor, D609, inhibited LPS-stimulated nitrite induction, but did not affect the potentiating effect of UTP, which was also unaffected by pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 8 h. Furthermore, the UTP-induced potentiation was abolished by BAPTA/AM or KN-93 (a selective inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)). Nitrite potentiation and iNOS induction were prominent when UTP was added simultaneously with LPS, with the potentiating effect being lost when UTP was added 3 h after treatment with LPS. Pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (3–30 μm), an inhibitor of NF-κB, caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the nitrite response to LPS and UTP. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, LPS produced marked activation of NF-κB and AP-1, which was potentiated by UTP. LPS-induced degradation of IκB-α as well as the phosphorylation of IκB-α were also increased by UTP. Moreover, the UTP-potentiated activation of NF-κB and AP-1 and the degradation and phosphorylation of IκB-α were inhibited by KN-93. Taken together, these data demonstrate that nucleotides, especially UTP, can potentiate the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and AP-1 and of iNOS induction via a CaMK -dependent pathway and suggest that the UTP-dependent up-regulation of iNOS may constitute a novel element in the inflammatory process.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that nucleotides, especially UTP, can potentiate the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and AP-1 and of iNOS induction via a CaMK -dependent pathway and suggest that the UTP-dependent up-regulation of iNOS may constitute a novel element in the inflammatory process. inducible nitric-oxide synthase lipopolysaccharide interferon tumor necrosis factor phosphatidylinositide Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylenetriphosphate) protein kinase C polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate electrophoretic mobility shift assay pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate CaMK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphatidylcholine, PLC, phospholipase C. NO is a free radical gas mediating intracellular communication in many mammalian organs (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). Three isoforms of nitric-oxide synthase have been identified and cloned (2Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar, 3Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The brain (type I) and endothelial (type III) enzymes are constitutively expressed, and their enzymatic activity is regulated by changes in concentrations of free Ca2+. The third member of the family is the inducible (type II) nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS),1 which is expressed in many different cell types and produces high levels of NO. Formation of large amounts of NO is involved in the bactericidal and tumoricidal actions of macrophages.In macrophages, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), alone or in combination with cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-1β, or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), has been shown to increase iNOS activity by increasing the transcription of the iNOS gene (4Lorsbach R.B. Murphy W.J. Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1908-1913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of iNOS induction depends on the cell type and on the animal species, with the enzyme being more easily induced in rodent cells than in their human counterparts, in which a cooperative interaction between several signals is required for iNOS expression (5Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4133) Google Scholar). iNOS protein can catalyze the formation of NO from the terminal guanidino nitrogen atom ofl-Arg (3Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NO generation plays an important role in the host defense response (6Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar).The regulation of iNOS gene expression is governed by the activity of several transcription factors. Sequence analysis of the murine iNOS promoter has revealed the presence of a number of consensus motifs for transcription factors, including NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB), AP-1 (activator protein-1), IFN-γ response element, γ-activated site, IFN-stimulated response element, TNF-α-responsive element, Oct, and NF-IL6 (nuclearfactor-interleukin-6) (7Lowenstein C.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); of these, NF-κB is of paramount importance (9Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D.

Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). NF-κB, named for its ability to recognize a κ light chain immunoglobulin gene regulatory element, can participate in the regulation of numerous genes (12Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4582) Google Scholar). It is a heterodimer composed of two subunits (50 and 65 kDa) belonging to the Rel family of transcriptional activators. In dormant cells, NF-κB is normally complexed with a member of the IκB proteins, which localize the transcription factor to the cytosol in an inactive state. Stimulation of the cells with ligands, such as LPS, TNF-α, or interleukin-1β, results in the rapid dissociation of IκB and the subsequent entry of active NF-κB into the nucleus, where it can interact with DNA (13Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar, 14Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar). Although the signaling mechanisms leading to NF-κB activation are not completely understood, it is widely believed that phosphorylation of IκB-α at Ser-32 or Ser-36, resulting in the degradation of IκB-α, is pivotal in the activation of NF-κB (15Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 16Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar).Extracellular ATP and other purine/pyrimidine nucleotides mediate intracellular signaling via P2 purinoceptors and induce many biological effects in various cell types. Since 1993, at least eight G protein-coupled P2Y purinoceptor subtypes have been cloned; their signaling cascades have been recently reviewed (17Fredholm B.B. Burnstock G. Harden T.K. Spedding M. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 39: 461-466Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, two pyrimidinoceptors, designated the P2Y4 and P2Y6 subtypes, have been cloned and sequenced (18Chang K. Hanaoka K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26152-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Communi D. Pirotton S. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol.

Commun. 1996; 222: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Pyrimidinoceptors are known to activate phosphoinositide (PI)-specific phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 and to increase intracellular Ca2+. In mouse J774 and RAW 264.7 macrophages, except the described P2X7 on the macrophage surface, we have previously demonstrated that UTP, acting via pyrimidinoceptors (another P2Y receptor subtype), can stimulate PI breakdown, increase intracellular Ca2+ levels, activate phospholipase A2, and modulate prostaglandin E1-induced cAMP formation (21Lin W.-W. Lee Y.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Lin W.-W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 321: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 23Lin W.-W. Chen B.-C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown in RAW 264.7 macrophages that extracellular ATP, UTP, and other nucleotides via an unknown P2Y purinoceptor subtype can potentiate LPS-induced NO production (24Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bistolfi T. Benatti U. De Flora A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the receptor subtype involved and the underlying mechanism are still unclear.To gain insight into the effect of nucleotides, particularly UTP, the selective agonist on pyrimidinoceptors, on the LPS-mediated induction of iNOS and its possible role in inflammatory diseases, we further examined the intracellular events involved in iNOS induction in macrophages. We report here that UTP via a calcium-dependent pathway potentiates the LPS-mediated activation of transcriptional factors and expression of iNOS in mouse J774 macrophages. This is the first report elucidating the stimulatory mechanism of nucleotides in NO release.DISCUSSIONNO, a diffusible free radical, is known to play many roles in diverse pathological conditions. Once iNOS is induced in monocytes/macrophages, the primary source of iNOS in inflammation, NO release may continue for hours or even days (40Hibbs Jr., J.B. Res. Immunol. 1991; 142: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have demonstrated the crucial role of NO in macrophage antimicrobial and tumoricidal activity. iNOS activity is mainly controlled at the transcriptional level in response to a wide array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial cell wall products and through the involvement of signaling pathways involved in host defense against pathogens and tumor cells (3Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined the effects of UTP, both alone and in combination with LPS, on iNOS expression and nitrite production in mouse J774 macrophages and have demonstrated that UTP potentiates LPS-induced nitrite production by ∼2-fold and increases iNOS induction by 140%, whereas UTP alone, at concentrations as high as 300 μm, induces neither nitrite production nor iNOS expression.In parallel with its effect on LPS-induced nitrite formation, UTP also potentiated the induction of iNOS by LPS. Pharmacological analysis revealed a requirement for PI turnover in the UTP response. The inhibitory effect seen with U73122 (a G protein-activated PI-PLC inhibitor), but not with its inactive analogue, U73343 (26Smith R.J. Sam L.M. Justen J.M. Bundy G.L. Bala G.A. Bleasdale J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 688-697PubMed Google Scholar), or with D609 (a PC-PLC inhibitor) (27Muller-Decker K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), indicates that UTP-elicited PI breakdown, which occurs via pyrimidinoceptors (21Lin W.-W. Lee Y.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), plays an essential role in NO production.Two bifurcate signaling cascades involved in stimulus-triggered PI breakdown (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and diacylglycerol-mediated PKC activation) have been established (41Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar) and are known to regulate a variety of cellular functions. In our previous study, we demonstrated a UTP-induced Ca2+ increase and PKC activation in mouse J774 macrophages (23Lin W.-W. Chen B.-C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+ is more important than PKC in the UTP-mediated NO response; this is based on the following evidence. First, a potentiating effect on NO induction similar to that produced by UTP is seen with thapsigargin, which elicits an increase in intracellular Ca2+ by inhibiting the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. Second, both the UTP- and thapsigargin-induced potentiating effects are abrogated by BAPTA/AM, a cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator. Our results also support the observation that, in murine peritoneal macrophages (34Park Y.C. Jun C.D. Kang H.S. Kim H.D. Kim H.M. Chung H.T. Immunology. 1996; 87: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), thapsigargin has a marked cooperative effect on LPS-, IFN-γ-, or PMA-induced NO synthesis. Third, the exposure time-dependent synergistic cooperation between LPS and UTP or thapsigargin results in both nitrite production and iNOS expression, and we therefore conclude that the increase in intracellular Ca2+ has a crucial priming effect on iNOS expression in mouse J774 macrophages. Fourth, two specific PKC inhibitors, Ro 31-8220 (an inhibitor of all PKC isoforms) and Go 6976 (a selective inhibitor of the “conventional” PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ) (30Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have no significant inhibitory effects on the UTP response. Fifth, PMA-mediated down-regulation of certain PKC isoforms does not alter the potentiating effect of UTP. According to the report of Fujihara et al. (28Fujihara M. Connolly N. Ito N. Suzuki T. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1898-1906PubMed Google Scholar), in J774 macrophages, PKCβII is primarily involved in LPS induction of NO formation, although the LPS-triggered signal transduction pathway may involve other PKC isoenzymes and/or different protein kinases in addition to PKCβII (28Fujihara M. Connolly N. Ito N. Suzuki T. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1898-1906PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, after 8 h of PMA treatment, a marked decrease in PKCβII, PKCε, and PKCδ, with a parallel decrease in NO release, was seen. In contrast, the down-regulation of PKCβI was less marked, and PKCμ, PKCλ, and PKCζ were resistant to PMA treatment for 24 h (data not shown).Our present results also confirmed the involvement of PKC in the signal transduction pathway by which LPS induces iNOS gene activation in macrophages, as previously suggested in J774 macrophages (28Fujihara M. Connolly N. Ito N. Suzuki T. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1898-1906PubMed Google Scholar, 42Severn A. Wakelam M.J.O. Liew F.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), RAW 264.7 macrophages (32Paul A. Pendreigh R.H. Plevin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and murine peritoneal macrophages (43Sodhi A. Kumar R. Int. J. Immunopathol. Pharmacol. 1994; 7: 65-77Google Scholar). Our data show that the LPS-induced NO production was attenuated by PKC inhibition with Ro 31-8220 or Go 6976 and by the PMA-mediated down-regulation of PKC. In addition, diacylglycerol, derived from PC-PLC, is responsible for LPS-mediated PKC activation in J774 macrophages (44Sands W.A. Clark J.S. Liew F.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and also participates in the LPS-induced NO synthesis, as shown by the fact that D609, a PC-PLC inhibitor (27Muller-Decker K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), attenuated the LPS response by 48% at a concentration not affecting cell viability.Although iNOS gene expression is distinctly regulated in response to specific cytokines in different cell types, it has recently been demonstrated that cAMP induces the expression of iNOS in LPS- or cytokine-stimulated macrophages (31Sowa G. Przewlocki R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 266: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Mullet D. Fertel R.H. Kniss D. Cox G.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 897-904PubMed Google Scholar). Our work, in which we used an inhibitor, rules out the involvement of this possible mechanism in the direct action of LPS and the potentiating effect of UTP since the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 (45Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cannot prevent LPS-mediated iNOS induction or its potentiation by UTP. Additionally, although release of TNF-α, known to be an autocrine factor for iNOS expression, was enhanced by ATP in RAW 264.7 macrophages (46Tonetti M. Sturla L. Giovine M. Benatti U. De Flora A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we did not detect any significant change of TNF-α release by UTP in J774 cells (data not shown). Thus, we exclude the possible involvement of TNF-α in the regulation of UTP-induced NO potentiation in J774 macrophages.There is increasing evidence for the presence, in the iNOS gene, of a consensus sequence for NF-κB binding (9Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimur T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 10Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar); this has been shown to be functionally important for the induction of iNOS. Indeed, our data showed that PDTC treatment of J774 cells blocks both LPS- and LPS/UTP-induced nitrite formation, demonstrating the requirement for NF-κB activation in this process. The time course study (Fig. 6) showed that the NO potentiation by UTP requires its co-addition with LPS and that even the short-term presence of UTP for 30 min is sufficient to elicit NO increase, suggesting the involvement of enhanced NF-κB activation in the UTP response. In correlation with this suggestion, we indeed found that the NF-κB activation caused by LPS was increased after UTP co-presence for 30 min (Fig. 8 C). Unexpectedly, we also found that the induction of iNOS by LPS and the potentiation of this effect by UTP showed different sensitivity to PDTC (Fig. 7), with the UTP effect being more sensitively inhibited than LPS. To explore this phenomenon, we have tested the effects of PDTC on UTP-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+. We found that PDTC at 3 μm can significantly reduce the Ca2+ response elicited by 100 μm UTP from an 856 ± 120 nm increase to 440 ± 45 nm (n = 3) (data not shown).To date, although more than one protein kinase has been shown to be responsible for the enhancement of NF-κB DNA binding by a variety of agents, the signaling mechanisms responsible for NF-κB activation are still not completely clear. Transfection studies have shown PKCε to be a likely candidate for mediating NF-κB activation/NO synthesis in RAW 264.7 macrophages in response to phorbol ester, but not to LPS or pro-inflammatory cytokines (47Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Bodelon O.G. Velasco M. Whelan R. Parker P.J. Bosca L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32028-32033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An in vitro study by Diaz-Meco et al. (48Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Dent P. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Hay R.T. Sturgill T.W. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) showed that PKCζ induces phosphorylation and inactivation of IκB-α. Protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of NF-κB is also involved in the inducible and constitutive activation of NF-κB (49Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Ribosomal S6 protein kinase is reported to be an essential kinase required for the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB-α in response to PMA (50Schouten G.J. Vertegaal A.C.O. Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Toebes M. Dorsman J.C. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3133-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recently, a new serine/threonine kinase IKKα (named CHUK) was shown to be an IκB-α-specific kinase common to receptors of the TNF family and to the interleukin-1 receptor (51DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar, 52Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Casein kinase II has also been proposed as a candidate for IκB-α phosphorylation (53Janosch P. Schellerer M. Seitz T. Reim P. Eulitz M. Brielmeier M. Kolch W. Sedivy J.M. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13868-13874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Although NF-κB activation in T cells has also been shown to be induced by Ca2+ ionophores, especially in the presence of PMA (36Steffan N.M. Bren G.D. Frantz B. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Paya C.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4685-4691PubMed Google Scholar, 54Mattila P.S. Ullman K.S. Fiering S. Emmel E.A. McCutcheon M. Crabtree G.R. Herzenberg L.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4425-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 55Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3396) Google Scholar), to date, only limited studies have demonstrated regulation of iNOS induction by calcium-dependent pathways. Interestingly, the synergistic effect seen here between calcium-dependent (represented by the action of UTP) and LPS-dependent pathways on NF-κB activation suggests the involvement of two distinct kinases acting on NF-κB. It is still unclear how the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase is involved in iNOS expression. However, in this work, we suggest, for the first time, that CaMK activation might play an important role in this downstream Ca2+-dependent signaling cascade. This is based on the fact that the selective CaMK inhibitor KN-93, at concentrations selective for the protein kinase (3 and 10 μm), can inhibit the potentiating effects of UTP on LPS-induced NO production, iNOS induction, NF-κB activation, IκB-α degradation and phosphorylation, and AP-1 activation. Similar prevention was also observed for the effects of thapsigargin on NF-κB activation and IκB-α degradation and phosphorylation. Although the CaMK-dependent pathway has been demonstrated in vivohere to participate in IκB-α phosphorylation, we still need more investigation to understand its direct or indirect action on the IκB-α molecule. To further confirm the specific action of KN-93 on CaMK, we determined the ineffectiveness of KN-93 (10 μm) on UTP-induced PI turnover and intracellular Ca2+ increase (data not shown). In this study, we demonstrated the activation of AP-1 by UTP and KN-93, and these effects are due to their activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated kinase, which in turn stimulates AP-1 via phosphorylation of the c-Jun component (data not shown).Regarding the regulatory role of the calcium/calmodulin-activated phosphatase calcineurin in NF-κB activation, conflicting results have been obtained. In Jurkat T cells and U937 monocytes, calcineurin has been suggested to act in synergy with PMA to accelerate IκB-α degradation and to increase NF-κB DNA-binding activity (35Frantz B. Nordby E. Bren G. Steffan N. Paya C. Kincaid R. Tocci M. O'Keefe S. O'Neill E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 36Steffan N.M. Bren G.D. Frantz B. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Paya C.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4685-4691PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it inhibits the PMA/ionomycin-mediated down-regulation of IκB-α in T cells (56Lai J.-H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our present results rule out any involvement of either of these possible mechanisms in the Ca2+-dependent induction of iNOS in J774 macrophages since FK506, an inhibitor of calcineurin, did not inhibit nitrite production (Fig. 5 A) or NF-κB DNA activity (data not shown).In conclusion, we have demonstrated the involvement of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in the pyrimidinoceptor-mediated potentiation of iNOS induction in mouse J774 macrophages. This effect is dependent on the activation of NF-κB and AP-1. The ability of nucleotides, especially UTP, to modulate iNOS expression via NF-κB activation reflects a potentially novel function of nucleotides in host defense, inflammation, and cytotoxic responses. NO is a free radical gas mediating intracellular communication in many mammalian organs (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). Three isoforms of nitric-oxide synthase have been identified and cloned (2Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar, 3Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The brain (type I) and endothelial (type III) enzymes are constitutively expressed, and their enzymatic activity is regulated by changes in concentrations of free Ca2+. The third member of the family is the inducible (type II) nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS),1 which is expressed in many different cell types and produces high levels of NO. Formation of large amounts of NO is involved in the bactericidal and tumoricidal actions of macrophages. In macrophages, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), alone or in combination with cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-1β, or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), has been shown to increase iNOS activity by increasing the transcription of the iNOS gene (4Lorsbach R.B. Murphy W.J. Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1908-1913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of iNOS induction depends on the cell type and on the animal species, with the enzyme being more easily induced in rodent cells than in their human counterparts, in which a cooperative interaction between several signals is required for iNOS expression (5Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4133) Google Scholar). iNOS protein can catalyze the formation of NO from the terminal guanidino nitrogen atom ofl-Arg (3Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J.

Here we show that mutations at Asp-53 or Asp-55 of theSulfolobus shibatae signature sequence abolish addition of both C and A, demonstrating that a single active site is responsible for addition of both nucleotides. Mutations at Asp-106 (and to a lesser extent, at Glu-173 and Asp-215) selectively impaired addition of A, but not C. We have previously demonstrated that the tRNA acceptor stem remains fixed on the surface of the CCA-adding enzyme during C and A addition (Shi, P.-Y., Maizels, N., and Weiner, A. M. (1998)EMBO J. 17, 3197–3206). Taken together with this new evidence that there is a single active site for catalysis, our data suggest that specificity of nucleotide addition is determined by a process of collaborative templating: as the single active site catalyzes addition of each nucleotide, the growing 3′-end of the tRNA would progressively refold to create a binding pocket for addition of the next nucleotide.

A Single Catalytically Active Subunit in the Multimeric Sulfolobus shibatae CCA-adding Enzyme Can Carry Out All Three Steps of CCA AdditionJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 279Issue 38PreviewThe CCA-adding enzyme ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase builds and repairs the 3′-terminal CCA sequence of tRNA. Although this unusual RNA polymerase has no nucleic acid template, it can construct the CCA sequence one nucleotide at a time using CTP and ATP as substrates. We found previously that tRNA does not translocate along the enzyme during CCA addition (Yue, D., Weiner, A. M., and Maizels, N. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 29693-29700) and that a single nucleotidyltransferase motif adds all three nucleotides (Shi, P.-Y., Maizels, N., and Weiner, A. Full-Text PDF Open Access The CCA-adding enzyme (ATP (CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase) adds the essential 3′-terminal CCA sequence to tRNA (1Deutscher M.P. Enzymes. 1982; 15: 183-215Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Sprinzl M. Cramer F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1979; 22: 1-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This enzyme is present in all three living kingdoms (3Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). In organisms that do not encode the 3′-terminal CCA sequence, including eukaryotes, many eubacteria, and some archaea, the CCA-adding enzyme carries out an essential step in tRNA biosynthesis. In organisms likeEscherichia coli where all tRNA genes encode CCA, the CCA-adding enzyme repairs 3′ termini depleted by exonucleolytic attack, but is not absolutely essential for survival (4Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2473-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The CCA-adding enzyme can use tRNA-CC, tRNA-C, or tRNA-N (containing only the discriminator base) as substrate. It completes the terminal CCA sequence by adding one nucleotide at a time. Despite the fact that the CCA-adding enzyme has no nucleic acid template, incorporation is highly specific and apparently error-free under physiological conditions: neither UTP nor GTP is incorporated into tRNA, and the enzyme does not add oligo(C) to tRNA-C when deprived of ATP or oligo(A) to tRNA-CC when deprived of CTP (3Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar, 5Shi P.-Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA. 1998; 4: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar). We recently cloned the CCA-adding enzyme from the thermophilic archaeonSulfolobus shibatae (3Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). The archaeal CCA-adding enzyme contained a clear match with the active-site signature of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (6Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), but it exhibited no strong homology to the eubacterial and eukaryotic CCA-adding enzymes (which are very similar to one another). This enabled us to divide enzymes of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily into two distinct classes (3Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). Class I enzymes include the archaeal CCA-adding enzymes (Fig. 1), eukaryotic poly(A) polymerases, DNA polymerase β, and kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase. Class II enzymes include eubacterial and eukaryotic CCA-adding enzymes and eubacterial poly(A) polymerases. Class II enzymes share 25 kDa of strong N-terminal homology, but diverge at the C termini (3Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar, 7Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In contrast, Class I enzymes exhibit little obvious similarity to each other or to class II enzymes outside of the active-site signature. The nucleotidyltransferase superfamily active-site signature (6Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) contains two carboxylates (DXD(E)) that are thought to occupy the same positions in space as seen in the crystal structures of DNA polymerase β (8Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 9Davies J.F. Almassy R.J. Hostomska Z. Ferre R.A. Hostomsky Z. Cell. 1994; 76: 1123-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase (10Sakon J. Liao H.H. Kanikula A.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11977-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These two carboxylates, together with a third contributed by a more distant region of the protein, coordinate two divalent metal cations that stabilize the trigonal bipyramidal transition state generated byS n2 attack of a hydroxyl group on a phosphoester bond (11Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Three carboxylates are necessary for DNA polymerase β activity: Asp-190 and Asp-192 within the conserved signature (12Date T. Yamamoto S. Tanihara K. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5286-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the distant Glu-256 (13Menge K.L. Hostomsky Z. Nodes B.R. Hudson G.O. Rahmati S. Moomaw E.W. Almassy R.J. Hostomska Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15934-15942Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly, three carboxylates are necessary for bovine poly(A) polymerase activity: Asp-113 and Asp-115 within the signature and the distant Asp-167 (7Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These data suggest that class I and II enzymes of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily use the same reaction mechanism as many other polymerases (14Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 15Steitz T.A. Smerdon S.J. Jager J. Joyce C.M. Science. 1994; 266: 2022-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The alignment of Martin and Keller (7Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) predicted that the third carboxylate should fall within an RRD motif in class II enzymes and within an RXD motif in class I enzymes as previously shown for DNA polymerase β and poly(A) polymerase. However, no RXD motif could be identified by inspecting the sequences of the four known archaeal CCA-adding enzymes. We therefore set out to mutate systematically each of the conserved carboxylates in the S. shibatae CCA-adding enzyme, keeping in mind that the archaeal enzyme might have dispensed with the need for a third carboxylate, as have a number of DNA and RNA polymerases (see “Discussion”). Sequence alignments predicted that the aspartate residues at positions 53 and 55 within the active-site signature of the S. shibatae CCA-adding enzyme would be critical to catalysis. Here we report that mutation of either Asp-53 or Asp-55 abolishes addition of both CTP and ATP by this enzyme. No third carboxylate seems to be absolutely required, although mutation of Asp-106 (and to a lesser extent, Glu-173 and Asp-215) diminishes ATP but not CTP addition. These data demonstrate that one catalytic center is responsible for addition of both CTP and ATP. In principle, a single catalytic center could translocate along the tRNA molecule to add all three nucleotides of the terminal CCA sequence. However, we have recently found that the tRNA acceptor stem does not translocate or rotate as each nucleotide is added to the 3′-end of tRNA-C, but remains fixed upon the surface of the enzyme (16Shi P.-Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Taken together, the observations that there is a single active site and that RNA polymerization occurs without translocation argue that the specificity of nucleotide addition is determined by a process of collaborative templating in which the enzyme and the bound tRNA substrate jointly specify the identity of the next nucleotide to be added. At each step of addition, the growing 3′-end of the tRNA would progressively refold to create a binding pocket for addition of the next nucleotide, until addition ceases when the CCA-binding pocket is full. To facilitate protein purification and site-directed mutagenesis, the S. shibatae cca gene (3Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the pET22x(b+) vector (Novagen), which supplies a hexahistidine tag. First, plasmid pEt22cca (Fig. 2) was generated by excising the cca gene from pET17cca by digestion withEcoRI and partial digestion with NdeI and cloning this fragment into the corresponding sites of pET22x(b+). To bring the carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag of the vector into frame with the CCA coding region, pET22cca-His was constructed by replacing sequences between the ClaI site in the gene and the HindIII site in the vector with a polymerase chain reaction fragment generated using primer oligonucleotides 1 and 3 and pET17cca as template (Table I); this fused the CCA coding region to the hexahistidine tag through a six-residue tether (LAAALE). The resulting construct was sequenced to ensure that no mutations had been introduced by polymerase chain reaction.Table IOligonucleotidesOligonucleotideUse or mutation generated 1.

(17Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). E. coli strain CJ236 (dut–, ung–) was transformed with pET22cca-His and infected with helper phage M13k07, and single-stranded phage DNA (corresponding to the CCA coding strand) was prepared by multiple phenol and chloroform extractions. Single-stranded DNA was annealed with mismatched oligonucleotides (synthesized at the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Center, Yale School of Medicine) (Table I) by heating to 90 °C, followed by slow cooling to 25 °C in a 10-μl reaction containing 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 2 mmMgCl2. Mutant strands were elongated by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase (100 units/ml) and T4 DNA ligase (300 units/ml) at 37 °C for 90 min in buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 17.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 3.75 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm each dNTP, and 0.75 mm ATP. Reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA, and plasmids were transformed intoE. coli strain BL21(DE3) (dut+ ,ung+). Mutants were identified by DNA sequencing and retransformed into BL21(DE3), and retransformants were resequenced. Two C-terminal mutants were constructed, ΔC30 and ΔC135, lacking 30 and 135 C-terminal residues, respectively. For ΔC30, the region between the ClaI and HindIII sites in pET22cca-His was replaced with a polymerase chain reaction fragment that was generated using primer oligonucleotides 2 and 3 and pET17cca as template and then digested with ClaI and HindIII. The reconstructed region of ΔC30 was sequenced to rule out mutations. For ΔC135, the region between the twoSacI sites in pET22cca was deleted, and the plasmid was recircularized, bringing the truncated CCA coding region into frame with the C-terminal His tag from the vector. His-tagged protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) by growth in 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C to induce gene overexpression. Native protein was purified over a nickel column as recommended by the manufacturer (Novagen). About 2 mg of pure protein could be obtained from 1 g of wet cells. Purified protein was stored at –20 °C in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad dye method. Tagged and untagged recombinant CCA-adding enzymes exhibited comparable activity and thermostability (data not shown). Standard assays measured incorporation of [α-32P]CTP or [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into unfractionated E. coli tRNA trimmed with venom phosphodiesterase (see below). The 10-μl reactions contained 100 mm glycine/NaOH (pH 8.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 μm CTP, 100 μm ATP, 40 pmol of tRNA, and 3 ng of enzyme (for CTP addition reactions) or 10 ng of enzyme (for ATP addition reactions). Reactions were terminated by addition of 5 μl of 95% formamide and 20 mm sodium EDTA (pH 8.0) containing bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol, resolved by denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and quantified by phosphoimager analysis. Reaction rates were measured by withdrawing 10-μl aliquots from a 60-μl reaction, and initial reaction rates were determined while the reaction was in the linear range. As theS. shibatae CCA-adding enzyme has an optimal temperature of 70 °C (3Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar), we compared the relative activities of various mutants at 56 °C in order to reduce potential complications due to globally destabilizing mutations (Ref. 18Shortle D. Lin B. Genetics. 1985; 110: 539-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; for review, see Ref. 19Veenstra D.L. Kollman P.A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The wild-type enzyme has about one-third the activity at 56 °C as at 70 °C (3Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). We also assayed mutants under low substrate “challenge” conditions; the conditions for CTP addition ([α-32P]CTP, 3 μm CTP, and 50 μm ATP; 0.25 μm tRNAAsp-C) and ATP addition ([α-32P]ATP, 100 μm ATP, and 1.5 μm CTP; 0.25 μm tRNAAsp-C) were chosen as described under “Results.” In challenge experiments, CTP- and ATP-adding activities were assayed using 10 and 3 ng of enzyme/10-μl reaction, respectively. Addition of both C and A by the CCA-adding enzyme can be assayed using crude unfractionated E. coli tRNA (Sigma, grade XXI), but the sensitivity of the assay is low and suffers from product inhibition. A more efficient substrate was prepared by trimming the 3′-ends of the unfractionated tRNA (100 mg total in 25 ml) with snake venom phosphodiesterase I (1.2 units/25 ml; Sigma) for 1 h at 20 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. Under these conditions, partial digestion by the 3′-exonuclease leaves a tRNA mixture with N, NC, and NCC ends, where N is the discriminator base; addition of both CTP and ATP increases by ∼10-fold after this treatment. To remove any rRNA fragments and degradation products, 3′-end-trimmed tRNA was bound to Q-Sepharose (2 mg of tRNA/ml column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), washed with the same buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl, and eluted with a 0.4–1.0m NaCl gradient, and the pooled tRNA fractions were precipitated with ethanol. All mutant CCA-adding enzymes were assayed using a single batch of 3′-end-trimmed tRNA substrate. Bacillus subtilis tRNAAsp lacking the 3′-CA sequence was transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase usingFokI-digested pmBsDCCA as template (a kind gift of N. Pace, University of California, Berkeley, CA) (20Oh B.-K. Pace N.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4087-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The runoff transcript was gel-purified as described (16Shi P.-Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). tRNA was quantified assuming anA 260 nm of 24 at 1.0 mg/ml. All CCA-adding enzymes belong to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily and share a similar active-site signature, which contains a DXD motif. Based on crystal structures for two enzymes in this family, DNA polymerase β and kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase, the carboxylates in the signature motif are thought to chelate the two metal ions involved in phosphoester bond transfer (11Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Martin and Keller (7Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) demonstrated by mutational analysis that the two carboxylates in the active-site signature motif are indeed essential for catalysis by another enzyme in this family, bovine poly(A) polymerase. The S. shibataeCCA-adding enzyme contains a clear DXD motif in the predicted active site (3Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the aspartate residues in this motif are critical for catalysis, we generated four mutants: D53A, D55A, D55E, and the D53A/D55A double mutant. We expressed and purified His-tagged proteins carrying these mutations and assayed activity. As shown in Table II, both CTP- and ATP-adding activities were drastically reduced in each of the mutants. D53A exhibited no ATP-adding activity and only 0.6% residual CTP-adding activity, and D55A had no activity at all. Even the relatively conservative substitution of glutamate for aspartate was not tolerated at position 55: D55E retained only 0.3% ATP-adding activity and 1% CTP-adding activity. These data confirm the identity of Asp-53 and Asp-55 as active-site carboxylates and imply that the active site is highly structured.Table IIActivity of C-terminal deletion and signature sequence mutantsEnzymeATP additionCTP addition%%C-terminal deletions WT2-aWT, wild-type enzyme.100100 ΔC300.20.6 ΔC135<0.05<0.05Signature sequence mutation WT100100 D53A<0.050.6 D55A<0.05<0.05 D53A/D55A<0.05<0.05 D55E0.31.0Initial reaction rates are shown and were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” using standard conditions with 5–120 ng of His-tagged purified enzyme/60-μl reaction.

Most enzymes that catalyze nucleotide transfer reactions, including the only two members of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily whose structures are known, DNA polymerase β (8Sawaya M.R.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11977-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), contain three active-site carboxylate residues that chelate two metal ions. Sequence comparisons with other nucleotidyltransferase superfamily members predicted the identity of the third carboxylate in bovine poly(A) polymerase, and the function of this residue was then established by systematic mutational analysis (7Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, sequence comparisons with other members of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily did not reveal a likely candidate for the third active-site carboxylate in the S. shibatae CCA-adding enzyme. We therefore decided to test all carboxylates that are well conserved among the four known archaeal CCA-adding enzyme sequences, S. shibatae (3Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M.

As shown in Fig. 1, alignment of the sequences of these enzymes identified 12 conserved carboxylates, in addition to the two within the active-site signature. We systematically replaced each of the conserved carboxylates in theS. shibatae enzyme with alanine, creating mutants E104A, D106A, E114A, D124A, E139A, D143A, E144A, E161A, E173A, E209A, D215A, and D218A. Surprisingly, none of the mutations in any of these positions had a significant effect on CCA-adding activity assayed under standard conditions with excess substrate and saturating nucleotides (data not shown). Our failure to identify a third active-site carboxylate residue by systematic alanine scanning mutagenesis suggested that saturating levels of all three substrates (tRNA, CTP, and ATP) might have obscured any defects caused by mutation. We therefore retested the mutants at lower substrate concentrations (challenge conditions) in the hope of revealing subtle defects in substrate binding or catalysis. We defined the challenge conditions empirically and, as our goal was to compare the CCA-adding activities of many different mutants, we carried out all assays at 56 °C to reduce the risk of thermal instability or denaturation that might occur at 70 °C, the temperature optimum for the wild-type enzyme. We first sought a tRNA substrate concentration that gave half-maximal CTP-adding activity at saturating ATP and CTP. CTP-adding activity was assayed using 0.125–4 μm tRNA at high (200 μm ATP and 50 μm CTP) and low (50 μm ATP and 12.5 μm CTP) nucleotide concentrations. As shown in Fig. 3, 1μm tRNA was nearly saturating at both NTP concentrations, and we therefore used 0.25 μm tRNA for subsequent assays. Next we sought ATP and CTP concentrations that gave half-maximal CTP- and ATP-adding activities at fixed 0.25 μm tRNA. We assayed CTP-adding activity using 3–50 μm ATP at fixed 25 μm CTP (Fig. 4 A), and using 1.5–25 μm CTP at fixed 50 μm ATP (Fig. 4 B). This experimental protocol was designed to test whether the ATP- and CTP-binding sites of the archaeal enzyme interact with each other, as appeared to be the case for the rabbit liver CCA-adding enzyme (24Masiakowski P. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11233-11239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Masiakowski P. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11240-11246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that CTP-adding activity was unaffected by up to 50 μm ATP (Fig. 4 A) and was half-maximal at 3 μm CTP (Fig. 4 B). Subsequent CTP addition assays were therefore performed at 3 μm CTP + 50 μm ATP. Similarly, we assayed ATP-adding activity using 6.2–100 μm ATP at fixed 50 μm CTP and found that 100 μm ATP was not saturating (Fig. 5 A). ATP was therefore fixed at 100 μm, and ATP-adding activity was assayed by varying CTP from 3 to 50 μm (Fig. 5 B). ATP addition was reduced at 3 μm CTP, the lowest CTP concentration tested. This was expected, as the tRNA substrates prepared by partial digestion of mature tRNA with venom phosphodiesterase lack the 3′-terminal CA and require addition of C before A. Subsequent ATP addition assays were therefore performed at 100 μm ATP + 3 μm CTP. All mutant CCA-adding enzymes, including point mutations and both deletions, were then retested for ATP- and CTP-adding activities under challenge conditions (Fig. 6,left and right panels, respectively). Some level of CTP- and ATP-adding activities (5–90%) was evident in all mutants, except those in the signature sequence (D53A, D55A, D55E, and D53A/D55A) and the two C-terminal deletions (ΔC30 and ΔC135). A number of the other mutants retained considerable activity under these conditions. However, in three mutants, activity was reduced to 20% or less of wild-type levels. D215A was defective in both CTP- and ATP-adding activities (16 and 13% of wild-type levels, respectively), and E173A was also defective in both CTP- and ATP-adding activities (19 and 7% of wild-type levels, respectively). Most intriguingly, D106A retained 90% of normal CTP-adding activity, but was only 14% as active as the wild-type enzyme when assayed for ATP-adding activity. The E. coli CCA-adding enzyme contains a potential ATP-binding motif (GXGXXG) just downstream of the active-site signature sequence, and a mutation in the second G in the motif (G70D) had previously been shown to diminish ATP- but not CTP-adding activity by 7–10-fold in crude extract (26Zhu L.Q. Cudny H. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14875-14877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this GXGXXG motif is not conserved in any other of the highly homologous class II nucleotidyltransferases such as the CCA-adding enzymes of a fungus (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), a higher plant (Lupinus albus), a metazoan (Caenorhabditis elegans), and a variety of other eubacterial CCA-adding enzymes and poly(A) polymerases (Acidominococcus fermentans, B. subtilis, Hemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium leprosae, and Thermus a"

A cell-free system that reconstitutes vesicle trafficking between the cis and medial Golgi cisternae has been used previously to identify several proteins involved in vesicular transport (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein,soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment proteins, p115, and p16); however, these factors are insufficient to drive the transport reaction. We have used a modified version of this in vitro intra-Golgi transport assay to guide purification of a new transport-stimulating activity. The active component is a 13 S hetero-oligomeric complex consisting of at least five polypeptides (approximately 110, 109, 90, 82, and 71 kDa), which we term Golgi transport complex (GTC). Hydrodynamic properties suggest that GTC is approximately 800 kDa and nonglobular. We obtained peptide sequence information from the 90-kDa subunit (GTC-90) that allowed us to identify a number of GTC-90 cDNAs. Comparison of these cDNAs with one another and with the genomic sequence suggests that the GTC-90 mRNA is alternatively spliced.

Much of the intracellular transport of proteins between the various compartments of the secretory pathway is mediated by small membrane-bounded vesicles (1Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar, 2Orci L. Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1986; 46: 171-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 3Orci L.

Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). These vesicles bud from one compartment and transport their cargo to the next compartment of the secretory pathway. A multitude of factors collaborate in this process: coat proteins (e.g. COPI (coatomer) or COPII) shape the membrane into a bud culminating in vesicle release (5Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar); a number of integral membrane proteins of the p24 family function in cargo selection during budding (6Nickel W. Wieland F.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); and a set of soluble and integral membrane proteins mediate target selection and membrane fusion (7Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Many of the proteins involved in vesicular transport have been identified and/or characterized through use of a well characterizedin vitro system that measures intra-Golgi protein traffic (8Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The assay measures the glycosylation of a cargo protein (vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein) present in one population of Golgi stacks by a glycosyltransferase present in another population of Golgi. In this system, COPI-coated transport vesicles form under the direction of a small GTPase termed ADP-ribosylation factor and a cytosolic coat protein complex termed coatomer (9Orci L. Palmer D.J. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 731-734Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The docking and fusion phases of the assay require a number of other proteins. For example,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF)1 and soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs) are required at a time point just prior to fusion and thus have been thought for some time to be integral components of the membrane fusion apparatus (10Malhotra V. Orci L. Glick B.S. Block M.R. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1988; 54: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Another protein identified with this system is p115 (12Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), which is also thought to act at the docking phase (13Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J.

Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 785-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is also required in this cell-free system and most likely acts at the membrane docking step (21Mayer T. Touchot N. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16097-16103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Last, a protein termed p16 has recently been identified and was suggested to have a role in the docking and/or fusion phase of early Golgi transport (22Legesse-Miller A. Sagiv Y. Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The final fusion event in this assay system is likely to be mediated by members of a family of integral membrane proteins called SNAP receptors (SNAREs) (23Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M.

Specific members of the SNARE family can be found on distinct target membranes (t-SNAREs) or on vesicles (v-SNAREs). Cognate v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs interact to form stable complexes (23Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar, 27Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E.

Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar, 31Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol.

This cross-membrane v/t-SNARE complex has recently been termed a “SNAREpin,” and it has been shown that SNAREs in this topological configuration can induce fusion of the docked membranes in the absence of other protein factors (33Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Recent studies of vacuole-vacuole docking and fusion in yeast, where the membranes involved in fusion possess both v- and t-SNAREs, have shown that NSF acts to disassemble v/t-SNARE complexes in the same membrane prior to, and as a prerequisite for, vesicle-target membrane docking and fusion (34Mayer A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 35Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 36Colombo M.I. Taddese M. Whiteheart S.W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18810-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the requirement for NSF and SNAP in the intra-Golgi in vitro system at a point temporally close to membrane fusion may reflect the requirement for unassociated v- and t-SNAREs in both the donor and acceptor membranes for subsequent SNAREpin formation (33Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). This cell-free system used to identify NSF, SNAP, p115, and p16 has been suggested to reconstitute the entire vesicular transport cycle, including vesicle budding, targeting, and fusion (7Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Extensive electron microscopic and biochemical analyses have clearly indicated that vesicles form during the assay, and it has been suggested that they carry the VSV-G protein from the “donor” Golgi to the “acceptor” Golgi, where it is glycosylated, resulting in the signal obtained in the biochemical assay (3Orci L. Malhotra V. Amherdt M. Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 56: 357-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, several studies have shown that the assay signal is not affected by removal of ADP-ribosylation factor (13Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 37Taylor T.C. Kanstein M. Weidman P. Melançon P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Happe S. Weidman P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which is required for vesicle formation (9Orci L. Palmer D.J. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 731-734Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar), suggesting that the transfer of VSV-G protein from donor to acceptor Golgi occurs via a partial transport reaction encompassing only the membrane docking and fusion steps. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the four proteins purified based on their activity in this in vitro system (NSF, SNAPs, p115, and p16) impact on the docking or fusion phases of transport, as shown by both biochemical studies (10Malhotra V. Orci L. Glick B.S. Block M.R. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1988; 54: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and genetic analyses of their homologs in yeast (15Sapperstein S.K. Lupashin V.V. Schmitt H.D. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Cell. 1990; 61: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In addition, removal of Rab proteins, which are generally thought to be involved in membrane docking (40Pfeffer S.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 441-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), inhibits thein vitro assay (41Elazar Z. Mayer T. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 794-797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the output of the intra-Golgi cell-free system is glycosylation of VSV-G, it is also possible that factors that effect glycosylation could exhibit activity. Indeed, it has been shown that the inclusion of uridine monophosphate kinase enhances the signal obtained by indirectly facilitating the uptake of radiolabeled UDP-sugar into the Golgi lumen, which is utilized by the glycosylation machinery (42Hiebsch R.R. Wattenberg B.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6111-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, this cell-free system is a powerful tool for identification and analysis of transport factors and may be primarily dependent on those involved in membrane docking and/or fusion and perhaps glycosylation of VSV-G. In this report, we describe the purification and initial characterization of a novel Golgi-associated protein complex containing at least five polypeptide chains, ranging from 71 to 110 kDa, that stimulates transport in this in vitro intra-Golgi transport system. pH measurements were done at room temperature; other manipulations were performed at 0–4 °C, unless otherwise noted. Dialysis membranes had a molecular mass cutoff of 12–14 kDa (BioDesign Inc.). Salt concentrations were determined by conversion from conductivity using a standard curve generated from 25 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol (w/v) with 0–1m KCl or from 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol (w/v) with 0–500 mm KPi (potassium phosphate). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford protein assay (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad) using a Beckman DU-64 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments). Unless otherwise noted, all fractions that were analyzed in the transport assay were first dialyzed into assay buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KOAc, 1 mm DTT). Six ml of 40 mg/ml BSA (fraction V; Sigma) in 25 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KOAc, 1 mm DTT were loaded onto six 10.5-ml 10–25% glycerol (w/v) gradients in the same buffer. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc.) at 40,000 rpm (198,000 ×g avg) for 24 h. The gradients were then fractionated into ∼0.8-ml fractions, and theA 280 peak was pooled, avoiding the leading edge of the peak that sedimented deeper into the gradient. The pool was loaded at 1.5 ml/min onto an 8-ml Mono-Q column (HR 16/10; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT. The column was washed with 16 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with a 60-ml gradient from 100 mm to 1 m KCl in the same buffer. Fractions (1.5 ml) were collected, and those with a minimum of contaminating proteins, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue-staining, were pooled and was referred to as purified BSA. The transport assay used in this purification is a modification of previously published assays (8Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E.

For the inhibition of in vitro transport with affinity-purified antibodies (Fig. 8), affinity-purified anti-GTC-90 (see below) was dialyzed extensively into assay buffer without DTT. The antibody was then serially diluted in assay buffer without DTT and added to a standard transport assay containing serial dilutions of either BBC-30, or the CHT2-I pool (see below). A preimmune IgG fraction was prepared on a protein A-Sepharose column according to the manufacturer's instructions, dialyzed into assay buffer without DTT, and used as a control for the inhibition experiments. Five cow brains were obtained immediately after slaughter, and bovine brain cytosol (BBC) was prepared and ammonium sulfate-precipitated as described previously (12Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), except that ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 30% saturation at 0 °C, and the pellet was resuspended with and dialyzed against 25 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmDTT, 10% glycerol (w/v). The dialysate (228 ml) had a protein concentration of 36.7 mg/ml. The protein concentration of the dialysate was adjusted to 10 mg/ml with 25 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol (w/v) and was loaded at 7.0 ml/min onto a 450-ml SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with the same buffer, and the protein that flowed through the column was collected and dialyzed extensively against 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT (T/D, pH 8.0) with 50 mm KCl. The material was then clarified in a Sorvall GS3 rotor at 8500 rpm for 15 min, resulting in a 1.2-liter pool with a protein concentration of 4.1 mg/ml. The dialyzed SP-Sepharose flow-through was loaded at 4.0 ml/min onto a 250-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol (w/v) (T/D/G, pH 8.0) with 50 mm KCl. The column was washed with 300 ml of equilibration buffer, followed by elution with a 300-ml gradient from 50 to 350 mm KCl in T/D/G, pH 8.0, followed by a 150-ml gradient from 350 mm to 1 m KCl in T/D/G, pH 8.0. Fractions (15 ml) were collected, and an aliquot of each was assayed for transport activity after dialysis into assay buffer. The active fractions, usually from 55 to 170 mm KCl, were pooled (133 ml) and had a protein concentration of 2.4 mg/ml. The salt concentration of the DEAE pool was adjusted to 100 mm KCl by the addition of T/D/G, pH 8.0, 3.0 m KCl and loaded onto a 30-ml Cibacron Blue 3GA (Sigma) column equilibrated in T/D/G, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl. The column was washed with 50 ml of equilibration buffer, followed by elution with 90 ml of T/D/G, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl. The eluted fractions were pooled (43 ml) and had a protein concentration of 2.4 mg/ml. The salt concentration of the Blue 3GA pool was adjusted to 1.5 m KCl by the addition of T/D/G, pH 8.0, 3 m KCl and loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto a 5-ml butyl-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in T/D/G, pH 8.0, 1.5 m KCl. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer followed by elution with 25 ml of T/D/G, pH 8.0, 3 mm KCl. The eluted material (9.0 ml) had a protein concentration of 4.3 mg/ml. The salt concentration of the butyl pool was adjusted to 100 mm KCl by the addition of T/D/G, pH 7.4. Potassium phosphate (KPi), pH 7.4, was then added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the pool was loaded at 1.0 ml/min onto a 2-ml CHT2-I column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in T/D/G, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm KPi. The column was washed with 4 ml of the same buffer followed by the elution of the bound material with a 14-ml gradient from 2 to 125 mmKPi in the same buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected in “low adhesion” polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (USA/Scientific Plastics) and immediately dialyzed in a microdialyzer (Life Technologies, Inc.) against assay buffer to remove the phosphate (extended exposure to phosphate seemed to reduce the activity of the fractions). An aliquot (7.5 μl) of each fraction was then assayed for transport activity. The active fractions, usually eluting from 50–75 mm KPi, were pooled (3 ml) and had a protein concentration of 0.96 mg/ml. The CHT2-I pool was concentrated to a volume of 0.5 ml using an Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Biomax-10K NMWL). The concentrated material was centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge to remove any insoluble material and then sieved at 0.25 ml/min through a 24-ml Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in T/D, pH 7.4, 100 mm KOAc, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, 250 μg/ml purified BSA. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected in low adhesion microcentrifuge tubes, and 15 μl of each fraction were assayed without prior dialysis. The active fractions, usually eluting between 9 and 11.5 ml, were pooled (2.5 ml). Because the column was run in the presence of BSA, protein concentrations from this point forward were not determined. The Superose 6 pool was loaded at 0.3 ml/min onto a 1-ml Mono-Q column (HR5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in T/D, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl. The column was washed with 2.5 ml of the same buffer followed by elution with a 7.5-ml gradient from 0.1 to 1.0 m KCl in the same buffer. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected in low adhesion tubes, and 3 μl of each fraction were assayed without prior dialysis. The active fractions, usually eluting from 250–300 mm KCl, were pooled (0.7 ml). This column acted primarily as a concentration step. The Mono-Q pool was layered onto a 4.7-ml linear 10–25% glycerol (w/v) gradient in T/D, pH 7.4, 100 mm KOAc. S value standards (α2-macroglobulin (Sigma), 20 S; catalase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 11.4 S; BSA (Sigma), 4.6 S) were loaded onto a second gradient. As a control for minor contaminants that may have remained in the purified BSA, 625 μg of purified BSA (approximately equivalent to the amount of BSA in the Mono Q pool) was applied to a third gradient. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 55,000 rpm for 6.5 h with slow acceleration and deceleration. Fractions (0.6 ml) were collected into low adhesion microcentrifuge tubes and analyzed by electrophoresis and silver staining (50Ansorge W. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1985; 11: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In addition, 7.5 μl of each fraction were assayed directly for transport activity. The active fractions, sedimenting at approximately 13 S, were pooled. The activity co-purified with a hetero-oligomeric complex composed of at least five subunits (see below), which we have termed the GTC. Pools from three GTC purifications (150 μg of total protein, estimated) were prepared for peptide sequencing by 6% trichloroacetic acid precipitation in the presence of 0.02% deoxycholate to concentrate them for SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed for 1 min in HPLC grade water and copper-stained (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each of the bands of the GTC complex was excised along with control gel slices of the same volume and relative molecular weight range from an adjacent lane in which no protein had been loaded. The gel slices were washed twice in 50% acetonitrile (Pierce) for 10 min, gently vortexing every 2 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the wet gel slices were frozen and stored at −20 °C. Sequences of three tryptic peptides derived from the 90-kDa subunit (GTC-90) were obtained at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA), where trypsin digestion, HPLC purification, and sequencing of the peptides by either Edman degradation (one peptide) or mass spectroscopy (two peptides) were performed. The three peptide sequences obtained from GTC-90 were used to search the dBEST data base with the BLAST algorithm (51Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) were found that coded for the three peptides. Two of these, I.M.A.G.E. Consortium clone numbers 53376 and 626427 were obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO), and the complete nucleotide sequences of the two cDNAs were determined. To obtain the 5′-end of the GTC-90 cDNA, a HeLa cDNA library (Stratagene) in Bluescript SK(−) was PCR-amplified in two rounds using a pair of primers nested in the 5′-end of clone 626427 and one primer in the Bluescript polylinker (M13–2) (53Saiki R.

https://openalex.org/W2069720751,"Anti-müllerian hormone type II receptor (AMHRII) is a serine/threonine receptor and a member of type II receptors of the transforming growth factor β superfamily. AMHRII has been recently identified in humans, mice, rats, and rabbits. In the male embryo, the AMHRII gene has been shown to be expressed in Sertoli's cells, in Leydig's cells and in the mesenchymal cells surrounding the müllerian duct. To determine the functional region of the AMHRII promoter as well as the factors controlling AMHRII gene expression, we used a 1.1-kilobase DNA fragment from the 5′-flanking region of the human AMHRII gene to generate a series of deletion or mutation and analyzed the resulting transcriptional activities after transfection of the NT2/D1 teratocarcinoma cell line. Our results indicate that maximal expression of the AMHRII promoter in this particular cell line, a cell line positive for endogenous AMHRII expression, requires a conserved estrogen receptor half-site element (AGGTCA) identical to the binding element for steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1). Studies of this SF-1 binding element using gel mobility shift, antibody supershift assays, and transient transfections of reporter constructs indicate that SF-1 can bind and transactivate the AMHRII promoter. Finally, SF-1 protein expression in human male embryos was shown to display a good coincidence with the previously reported AMHRII expression profile.

Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH),1 also known as müllerian inhibiting substance, is a glycoprotein dimer that belongs to the growing family of the transforming growth factors β (1Jost A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1953; 8: 379-418Google Scholar). AMH, the earliest product secreted by Sertoli's cells, plays a critical role during early male fetal sex differentiation by inducing the regression of the müllerian ducts, the anlagen of the uterus, the Fallopian tubes, and the upper vagina. In the last 4 years, major progress has been realized in our understanding of AMH action by the isolation of its receptor (2Baarends W.M. van Helmond M.J.L. Post M. van der Schoot P.J.C.M.

Members of the transforming growth factor β family signal through a heteromeric signaling complex composed of two related type I and II receptors, both transmembrane serine/threonine kinases (5Wrana J.L. Tran H. Attisano L. Arora K. Childs S.R. Massagué J. O'Connor M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Type II receptors appear able to bind their ligands independently of type I components, but activation of the corresponding signal transduction pathway will require the presence of the two types of receptor (6Massagué J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). As a transforming growth factor β family member, AMH does not escape this rule and the receptor cloned in humans, mice, rats, and rabbits is an AMH type II receptor (AMHRII). Formal proof to equate this receptor with the AMH receptor came from the production of AMHRII mouse mutants using targeted mutagenesis (7Mishina Y. Rey R. Finegold M.J. Matzuk M.M. Josso N. Cate R.L. Behringer R.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2577-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The mutant mice harbor the same resulting phenotype observed in AMH mutant as internal pseudohermaphrodites with uterine and oviductal tissues, a condition known in humans as persistent müllerian duct syndrome (8Guerrier D. Tran D. van der Winden J.M. Hideux S. Van Outryve L. Legeai L. Bouchard L. van Vliet G. de Laet M.H. Picard J.Y. Khan A. Josso N. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Simultaneously, analysis of developmental expression of AMHRII was reported by many groups in different models but always at the transcript level (2Baarends W.M. van Helmond M.J.L. Post M. van der Schoot P.J.C.M. Hoogerbrugge J.W. de Winter J.P. Uilenbroek J.T.J. Karels B. Wilming L.G. Meijers J.H.C. Themmen A.P.N. Grootegoed J.A.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). All these data agree with an expression for AMHRII at the right time and right place in male embryos,i.e. in the window of sensitivity of the müllerian duct to AMH within the mesenchyme cells surrounding the male müllerian epithelium where AMH elicits its action (10Tsuji M. Shima H. Yonemura C.Y. Brody J. Donahoe P.K. Cunha G.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 124: 1481-1488Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In these studies, other cellular sites of AMHRII expression are also depicted in Sertoli's and granulosa cells of both fetal and adult gonads. More recently, expression of AMHRII on Leydig's cells was also reported (11Racine C. Rey R. Forest M.G. Louis F. Ferré A. Huhtaniemi I. Josso N. di Clemente N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A striking coincidence between AMH and AMHRII receptor expressions has led to diverse speculations on a putative autocrine feedback control of AMH (3di Clemente N. Wilson C. Faure E. Boussin L.

Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results also open the possibility that a similar combinatorial transcription factor complex is used to control both genes. Previous studies reported that AMH expression is under the control of a 180-bp DNA fragment including a single estrogen receptor half-site (AGGTCA) recognized by a protein designated steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) (13Shen W.H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The functional importance of the AMH proximal promoter was supported by several observations including the coincident expression profile between SF-1 and AMH (13Shen W.H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 14Giuli G. Shen W.H. Ingraham H.A. Development. 1997; 124: 1799-1807PubMed Google Scholar). Beyond this particular function during the sex determining process in Sertoli's cells, SF-1 was also shown to be important in the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis or in the development of different endocrine tissues (15Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 16Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Because of the parallelism in the expression profile of both anti-müllerian hormone and AMHRII receptors, we now address the possibility that regulation of the two genes could use common factors. Thus, in the present study we first determined a minimal promoter activity within a 1.1-kb DNA fragment from the 5′-flanking of the human AMHRII gene. Then we identified the presence of a conserved SF-1 binding site in this sequence and demonstrated its functional requirement in the regulation of the AMHRII gene. Finally, using immunolocalization studies the developmental pattern of expression of the SF-1 protein was shown to be coincident with AMHRII expression described in previous reports. Human AMHRII DNA 5′ flanking sequences were generated by PCR using genomic DNA as a template and were next extended with a human PromoterFinderTM DNA Walking kit (CLONTECH). The sequences and positions of the two specific primers were as follows. The forward primer, 5′-CCACATAGCAAAATTTACCATTG-3′, is complementary to the human AMHRII genomic sequence deposited in GenBankTM under accession number U29700 and corresponds to nucleotides −544 to −522, whereas the reverse primer, 5′-CTTGCTGGAGGATGGCAGCAGC AG-3′, is complementary to that of nucleotides +81 to +56 (numbering from the transcription start site previously defined (21Imbeaud S. Faure E. Lamarre I. Mattéi M.G. di Clemente N. Tizard R. Carré-Eusèbe D. Belville C. Tragethon L. Tonkin C. Nelson J. McAuliffe M. Bidart J.M. Lababidi A. Josso N. Cate R.L. Picard J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar)). The amplification product was cloned into pUC18 (SureClone ligation kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA sequence was determined to verify identity with AMHRII sequence. The human PromoterFinderTM DNA Walking kit was used with the reverse GSP1 reverse primer 5′-GCCCTTCCCTGACCTTGGAAGAAGA-3′ corresponding to nucleotides −253 to −277 in the first reaction and with the GSP2 reverse primer GAAAACAGTAACAATGGTAAATTT corresponding to nucleotides −511 to −534 (Fig. 1). The 1.1-kb AMHRII 5′-flanking region was finally reconstructed into the pUC18 plasmid with the help of an endogenousBglII restriction site located at position −375 bp and was fully sequenced. The reporter gene construct was generated using the pGL family of luciferase reporter vectors (Stratagene). The −1058/+78-AMHR-pUC18 plasmid was used as a template to amplify AMHRII promoter DNA from positions −1058 to +78 by PCR. The forward and reverse primers contain, respectively, the recognition sites for KpnI and XhoI. After KpnI-XhoI digestion, one copy of the 1136-bp PCR product was inserted in theKpnI-XhoI sites of pGL3-promoter vector. This construct will be referred to as −1058/+78-pGL3p. The same strategy was used to produce −546/+78-pGL3p and −257/+78-pGL3p deletion mutants. −1054/−374 was created by BglII hydrolysis of the −1058/+78-pGL3p construct. Site-directed mutagenesis of the SF-1 binding site to produce −1058SF-1MUT-pGL3p was performed using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the help of the RAMH-MUT oligonucleotide (see below). Full-length SF-1 cDNA was cloned as a BamHI and EcoRI fragment into the pcDNA3 vector, which directs transcription from the cytomegalovirus promoter as described previously. 2de Santa Barbara, P., Bonneaud, N., Boizet, B., Desclozeaux, M., Moniot, B., Sudbeck, P., Scherer, G., Poulat, F., and Berta, P. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol., in press. Nuclear extracts from NT2/D1, HeLa, and transfected HeLa cells were prepared from freshly haversted cultured cells according to the method of Dignam et al. (17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9058) Google Scholar). For SF-1 transfected HeLa cells, 60–80% confluence cells were transfected with 2 μg of SF-1 expression plasmid and 7 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) for 4 h. The nuclear extracts were then prepared after 48 h of culture. The pGEX-4T3-SF-1 expression vector was used to produce the recombinant protein in the bacterial strain BL21 (DE3) after induction by 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 2 h of induction at 30 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 25% sucrose, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) supplemented with bovine deoxyribonuclease I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.5 mm Pefabloc-SC-AEBSF (Interchim) and sonicated for 5 min at 4 °C. Bacterial debris were removed by centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 20 min. The lysate was loaded on glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed three times with buffer I (5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, Tris 50 mm, pH 7.6) and three times with buffer II (5 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, Tris 50 mm, pH 7.6). Purified proteins were checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and then used directly for in vitrobinding assay studies after elution from the matrix with buffer II plus 10 mm reduced glutathione after 30 min of incubation at 4 °C. Protein binding to AMHRII promoter DNA probes was assessed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). For these experiments, duplex oligonucleotides were labeled by end-filling of protruding ends in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and DNA polymerase I-Klenow fragment for 1 h at 37 °C. The labeled probe was purified on a 5% nondenaturant acrylamide gel and eluted overnight in 0.8 mNH4Ac, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS buffer at 50 °C. Binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 15 min in 20 μl comprising 5–10 μg of either nuclear extracts or recombinant proteins mixed to 32P-labeled probe (10,000 cpm), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. For competition or supershift experiments, an unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide or an antibody solution was incubated for 15 min at room temperature before adding the probe. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 4 °C, fixed by 10% methanol/10% acetic acid, dried, and then autoradiographed. The DNA probes used in these assays were complementary double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides including the SF-1 binding site from the AMHRII promoter (RAMH-BS) or the SF-1 binding site from the AMH promoter (SF-1-BS). The nucleotide sequences of the top strands of the oligonucleotides are as follows: RAMH-BS, 5′-GCATCTTCTTCCAAGGTCAGGGAAG-3′; RAMH-MUT, 5′-GCATCTTCTTCCAATTTC AGGGAAG-3′; and SF-1-BS, 5′-GGCACTGTCCCCCAAGGTCGC-3′. The mutated nucleotides are in bold. The human NT2/D1 cell line (N-Tera 2, clone D1, a human pluripotent embryonic carcinoma cell line) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (number CRL 1973, ATCC, Biovaley, France). NT2/D1, HeLa, and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Imperial Laboratories, Flobio, France) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies Inc.), penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mmglutamine with pCO2 of 5% at 37 °C in humidified air. Plasmids used for transfections were purified using the maxiprep reagent system (Qiagen). COS-7, HeLa, or NT2/D1 cells at 60–80% confluence were washed twice with serum-free medium and then cotransfected with 250 ng of reporter plasmid, 25 ng of Renilla luciferase control promoter vector (Promega) used as an internal control for transfection efficiency, and SF-1 expression plasmid with 3 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) in 200 μl of serum-free medium. After 4 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with 500 μl of medium supplemented with 10% serum, and cells were harvested after 48 h of culture. Luciferase assays were checked with the Dual-Luciferase™ Reporter Assay (Promega). Promoter activities were expressed as relative luciferase activity units/Renilla unit, and each value represents the mean of six separate wells. Human embryonic gonadal tissues were obtained from therapeutic termination (week of gestation) as part of a program approved by both the ethics committee from CNRS and by the French National Ethics Committee. Embryos were staged according to the recognizes Carnegie stages (18O'Rahilly R. Anat. Embryol. 1983; 166: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The youngest embryonic DNAs were extracted from limbs and demonstrated to be male by polymerase chain reaction as described (19Josso, N., Lamarre, I., Picard, J. Y., Berta, P., Davies, N., Morichon, N., Peschanski, M., and Jeny, R. Early Hum. Dev.33, 91–99Google Scholar). Sections were probed by an overnight incubation at room temperature with the appropriate antibody, anti-SF-1 (as previously described and fully characterized)2 or anti-AMH, respectively, with a 1:100 and a 1:400 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline-bovine serum albumin. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, primary antibodies were visualized with Fluorolink Cy2-conjugated anti-rat labeled goat antibodies (dilution, 1:200) or with biotinylated anti-rabbit (dilution, 1:200) and Texas red-conjugated streptavidin-labeled sheep antibodies (dilution, 1:400). In each case incubations were performed for 90 min in the same conditions described for the primary antibodies. Sections were washed again and mounted in FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem). Images were collected and processed on a Bio-Rad confocal microscope or on a Zeiss Axiophot. The human AMH receptor type II gene has been previously cloned (2Baarends W.M. van Helmond M.J.L.

As a first step to understand its transcriptional control, we synthesized the recently published 5′-flanking sequence (21Imbeaud S. Faure E. Lamarre I. Mattéi M.G. di Clemente N. Tizard R. Carré-Eusèbe D. Belville C. Tragethon L. Tonkin C. Nelson J. McAuliffe M. Bidart J.M. Lababidi A. Josso N. Cate R.L. Picard J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction, and this sequence was subsequently extended by a walking procedure. As shown in Fig. 1, sequence analysis of the resulting 1.1 kb did not reveal any canonical TATA or CCAAT box. A computer search (20Wingender E. Dietze P. Karas H. Knüppel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) for regulatory elements identified two Sp1 sites (at −42 and −634), one SOX site (at −525), and two GATA motifs lying very closely to the transcription initiation site recently defined (21Imbeaud S. Faure E. Lamarre I. Mattéi M.G. di Clemente N. Tizard R. Carré-Eusèbe D. Belville C. Tragethon L. Tonkin C. Nelson J. McAuliffe M. Bidart J.M. Lababidi A. Josso N. Cate R.L. Picard J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Through this analysis and previous analysis (21Imbeaud S. Faure E. Lamarre I. Mattéi M.G. di Clemente N. Tizard R. Carré-Eusèbe D. Belville C. Tragethon L. Tonkin C. Nelson J. McAuliffe M. Bidart J.M. Lababidi A. Josso N. Cate R.L. Picard J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), a perfect consensus SF-1 response element (CCAAGGTCA) conserved in the mouse was detected at positions −270 to −262. An identical DNA element located in the AMH minimal promoter has led recently to the implication of SF-1 in the regulation of AMH expression (13Shen W.H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To assess its transcription activity, this 1.1-kb DNA fragment was fused to the luciferase reporter gene and then transiently transfected in NT2/D1, HeLa or COS-7 cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the 1.1-kb DNA sequence increased luciferase expression in NT2/D1 cells about 4.5-fold. In contrast, this fragment did not enhance pGL3p expression in HeLa or COS cells. These results document that a promoter activity is indeed present in the 1.1 kb of upstream sequence but also the cell selectivity of this activity. The NT2/D1 cell line has been shown to express most (if not all) the genes described so far as involved in the sex determination cascade (Refs. 22Clépet C. Schafer A.J. Sinclair A.H. Palmer M.S. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar and 23Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.P. Gozé C. Rebillard X. Calas B. Lamb N. Berta P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 737-748Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar and data not shown). Moreover, an endogenous expression of the AMHRII gene in the NT2/D1 cells was detected by reverse transcription-PCR assay confirming that this cell line is a convenient model to explore AMHRII transcriptional regulation (data not shown). A series of reporter constructs was designed to sequentially delete putative transcription factor binding sites within the promoter. The results of this analysis are summarized in Fig. 2 B. Deletion or site-directed mutagenesis of the SF-1 binding site resulted in a significant reduction in the AMHRII promoter activity relative to the 1.1-kb intact promoter. All the activities were estimated using transient transfection assays in the NT2/D1 cell line. To assess whether the SF-1 motif delineated in the above study might effectively bind the corresponding protein, we examined the binding of SF-1 to this sequence derived from the human AMHRII promoter. Therefore, EMSAs were carried out using GST-SF-1 fusion protein and a synthetic oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the AMHRII promoter SF-1 motif (Fig. 3 A). A band containing the SF-1/DNA complex was clearly observed, competed specifically by an unlabeled probe, and ablated by including anti-SF-1 polyclonal antibody. Similar results were obtained when EMSAs were carried out using nuclear extracts prepared from NT2/D1 cell line, a cell line expressing endogenous SF-1. The gel shift band was again competed by unlabeled probe with a sequence derived from either the AMHRII receptor or the AMH promoter and was abolished by including the SF-1 antibody (Fig. 3 B). Finally, as a control, EMSAs were also performed using nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells or from HeLa cells after transfection with a SF-1 expression plasmid pCDNA3-SF-1 (expressing SF-1 under the control of the cytomegalovirus minimal promoter; see “Materials and Methods”) (Fig. 3, C and D). Together, these results demonstrated that SF-1 transcription factor can bind in vitro to the AMHRII gene promoter. We next examined the functional importance of this interaction in co-transfection assays. For this purpose, reporter plasmids containing the 1.1-kb AMHRII promoter region fused to the firefly luciferase (−1058/+78-pGL3p) were transfected into HeLa cells along with pCDNA3-SF-1. As shown in Fig. 4, if the 5′-flanking region of the AMHRII gene has failed again by itself to activate luciferase activity in HeLa cells, a cell line that lacks endogenous SF-1 protein (13Shen W.H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), addition of increasing amounts of SF-1 expression plasmid has led to a 5-fold higher reporter activity. This activation was completely abolished after mutation of the SF-1 binding site (−1058SF-1MUT-pGL3p construct) to prevent SF-1 protein binding (Fig. 4). Even if the level of activation remains rather low with a large amount of exogenous SF-1, these results provide strong evidence on the ability of SF-1 to activate the AMHRII promoter and the requirement of an intact SF-1 binding site to maintain this transactivation capacity. They also suggest that SF-1 do not require a ligand or a cofactor to activate AMHRII expression. This contrasts with the fact that SF-1 by itself was unable to activate the AMH promoter in HeLa cells (13Shen W.H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, contradictory data have been recently outlined on this requirement for SF-1 (24Zimmermann S. Schwärzler A. Buth S. Engel W. Adham I.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 706-71324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of AMHRII, our results do not exclude the involvement of other synergistic factors that could enhance but also direct AMHRII expression to specific sites, even if the AMHRII expression profile remains wider than the one described for AMH in urogenital ridges (25Münsterberg A. Lovell-Badge R. Development. 1991; 113: 613-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence that SF-1 controls AMHRII gene in vivo came from analysis of the expression pattern of SF-1 by immunochemistry to establish a correlation between SF-1 and AMHRII expression. Recently, expression of AMHRII has been extensively analyzed (2Baarends W.M. van Helmond M.J.L. Post M. van der Schoot P.J.C.M. Hoogerbrugge J.W. de Winter J.P. Uilenbroek J.T.J. Karels B.

Androl. 1996; 17: 336-341PubMed Google Scholar). In embryos, this expression appears localized in the urogenital ridges coincidentally with müllerian duct regression, in fetal Sertoli's and granulosa cells. This expression was recently extended to the Leydig's cell compartment (11Racine C. Rey R. Forest M.G. Louis F. Ferré A. Huhtaniemi I. Josso N. di Clemente N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Other sites of expression during the posnatal or adult life are also documented (26Teixera J. Donahoe P.K. J. Androl. 1996; 17: 336-341PubMed Google Scholar). The description of a specific anti-SF-1 polyclonal antibody provides us with an appropriate tool to describe SF-1 expression during human embryonic life at the level of the protein product.2 Using a 6.5–7-week-old human embryo we showed a nuclear expression for SF-1 in aligned Sertoli's cells also characterized by their AMH expression (Fig. 5, panels 1 and 2). Similarly, a nuclear expression was also detected in cells outside the seminiferous tubes, presumably in the future Leydig's cells (Fig. 5, panels 1 and 2). At this developmental stage, SF-1 expression was also detected in the mesenchymal cells surrounding the müllerian duct, a location where the AMHRII is also known to be expressed (Fig. 5, panel 3). In an 8.5-week-old male human embryo, SF-1 immunostaining signal appeared rather diffuse, spreading over the degenerating müllerian duct (Fig. 5, panel 4). This is in agreement with previous reports analyzing AMHRII mRNA expression during müllerian duct regression in the rat (2Baarends W.M. van Helmond M.J.L. Post M. van der Schoot P.J.C.M. Hoogerbrugge J.W. de Winter J.P. Uilenbroek J.T.J. Karels B. Wilming L.G. Meijers J.H.C. Themmen A.P.N. Grootegoed J.A.

In conclusion, the present work suggests that proper AMHRII gene activation may require a perfectly consensual DNA binding element for the SF-1, a member of the orphan nuclear receptor family located in the AMH type II receptor proximal promoter. The present data with previous reports analyzing AMHRII gene expression (2Baarends W.M. van Helmond M.J.L. Post M. van der Schoot P.J.C.M. Hoogerbrugge J.W. de Winter J.P. Uilenbroek J.T.J. Karels B.

Androl. 1996; 17: 336-341PubMed Google Scholar) provide the first evidence that SF-1 could have an essential role in the transcriptional control of the AMHRII promoter. Transgenic experiments using the AMHRII promoter described herein may now be a useful tool to confirm the role of the SF-1 binding site in this regulation, a strategy recently used for AMH (14Giuli G. Shen W.H. Ingraham H.A. Development. 1997; 124: 1799-1807PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the conserved DNA binding sites present in their respective promoters suggest other potential similarities in their mode of control. In this respect both SOX92 and GATA-4 described recently to contribute to AMH regulation (27Viger R.S. Mertineit C. Trasler J.M. Nemer M. Development. 1998; 125: 2665-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) will provide some attractive candidates to contribute to AMHRII control. This intriguing possibility is now under investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2124615128,"Adipocytes contain three major substrate proteins of the insulin receptor, termed IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3. We demonstrated that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are located mainly in the low density microsome (LDM) fraction and are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation, leading to phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activation. In contrast, IRS-3 is located mainly in the plasma membrane (PM) fraction and contributes to PI 3-kinase activation in the PM fraction. The different cellular localizations of IRS proteins may account for the mechanism of insulin resistance induced by a high fat diet, considering that PI 3-kinase activation in the LDM fraction is reportedly essential for the translocation of GLUT4 in adipocytes. High fat feeding in rats increased both protein and mRNA levels of IRS-3 but decreased those of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in epididymal adipocytes. As a result, selective impairment of insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activation was observed in the LDM fraction, whereas PI 3-kinase activation was conserved in the PM fraction. This is the first report showing that different IRS proteins function in different subcellular compartments, which may contribute to determining the insulin sensitivity in adipocytes.

Insulin induces numerous cell activities in adipose tissue, which include cell proliferation and differentiation, stimulation of glucose uptake, inhibition of lipolysis, translocation of various membrane proteins such as transferrin receptor and insulin-like growth factor II receptor, and synthesis and/or secretion of leptin (1Tanner L.I.

Although it remains unclear which step in the insulin signaling pathway is related to each of these individual activities, it seems certain that insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)1 activation plays a critical role in the translocation of GLUT4 from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface (4Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 529-546PubMed Google Scholar, 5Czech M.P. Clancy B.M. Pessino A. Woon C.W. Harrison S.A. Trends Biochem.

J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) suggested that PI 3-kinase activation in the intracellular compartment, but not on the plasma membrane, is necessary for the efficient translocation of GLUT4 (7Yang J. Clarke J.F. Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In adipocytes it has been reported that not only IRS-1 and IRS-2, but also a protein of approximately 60 kDa referred to as pp60, are major substrates that are tyrosine phosphorylated by the insulin receptor (8Thies R.S. Molina J.M. Ciaraldi T.P. Freidenberg G.R. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 250-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mooney R.A. Bordwell K.L. Luhowskyj S. Casnellie J.E.

Recently, pp60 was cloned and termed IRS-3 in rat and mouse adipocytes, and its structure was shown to have several similarities to IRS-1 and IRS-2 (11Sciacchitano S. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4931-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of IRS-3 with the other members of the IRS family revealed that these IRS proteins contain pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains that are highly conserved (11Sciacchitano S. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4931-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

In addition, there is conservation of many tyrosine phosphorylation motifs responsible for interactions with downstream signaling molecules containing SH2 domains, including PI 3-kinase. However, IRS-3 is far smaller than IRS-1/2 and has some regions that have no homology to IRS-1/2. Therefore, IRS-3 may have some unique role in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. IRS-1 and IRS-2 have been shown to participate in the insulin signaling pathway whereby insulin stimulates translocation of GLUT4 in adipose cells (13Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L. Liu M.L.

Our data suggest that different IRS proteins may be important in the activation of SH2-containing proteins including PI 3-kinase in different subcellular compartments, which may induce different cellular activities. In addition, we investigated how the expression levels of IRS-3 as well as IRS-1 and IRS-2 are regulated in high fat-fed rat adipocytes, in which insulin resistance is present. The different regulation of IRS-3 from that of IRS-1 and IRS-2 would induce a different degree of PI 3-kinase activation in the different subcellular locations, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. This is the first paper showing the different role of IRS-3 and also suggesting the possibility that the difference in regulation of expression of IRS proteins may affect insulin sensitivity in fat cells. Bovine serum albumin, fraction V, was purchased from Intergen (Purchase, NY). Collagenase and PI were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Insulin was purchased from Novo Nordisk (Denmark). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Aluminum-backed silica gel thin layer chromatographic plates were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Protein A-Sepharose 6MB was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (U. K). All other chemicals were purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 5 weeks old and 110–140 g, were purchased from Tokyo Experimental Animals (Tokyo, Japan) and housed under controlled light (12/12 h) and temperature conditions with free access to food and water. After a 2–3-day acclimatization period, the rats were divided into a normal chow group and a high fat diet group and fed ad libitum for 2 weeks. The high fat diet consisted of 58% lard (w/w), 30% fish powder, 10% skimmed milk, and a 2% vitamin and mineral mixture (equivalent to 7.5% carbohydrate, 24.5% protein, and 60% fat). The normal chow proportions were 54% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and 4.5% fat. Specific antibodies against IRS-1 and IRS-2 were prepared as described previously (15Anai M. Funaki M. Ogihara T. Terasaki J. Inukai K. Katagiri H. Fukushima Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The antibody against IRS-3 was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide derived from its specific amino acid sequence of the carboxyl terminus (PPLEVPGAAPGNSPHSYASIKF). Anti-p85α antibody and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biochemistry (Lake Placid, NY). All of the rats were killed by decapitation after 12–14 h of fasting. Isolated adipocytes were prepared from epididymal fat pads by shaking at 37 °C for 20 min in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing collagenase (3 mg/ml) and bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml), according to the methods of Robdell (16Robdell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated adipocytes were preincubated in 1% bovine serum albumin and Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 15 min and then stimulated with 10−7m insulin for 5 min. After insulin stimulation, adipocytes were washed three times with HES buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mmsucrose, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate) and used for PI 3-kinase assay or Western blotting immediately or after cell fractionation. Isolated adipocytes incubated with or without insulin were homogenized and fractionated as described previously by Simpson et al. (17Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys.

The homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, the solidified fat cake was removed carefully, and the supernatant was saved for preparation of the microsomal membrane fraction. The initial pellet was resuspended and recentrifuged once before being resuspended in 5 ml of buffer, applied to a 1.12 m sucrose cushion containing 20 mmTris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, and centrifuged at 101,000 ×g max for 70 min. The mitochondria, nuclei, and cell debris were collected as a pellet; however, in this experiment, we did not analyze this fraction further. The plasma membranes (PM), collected at the interface, were resuspended in 50 ml of buffer and centrifuged at 48,000 × g max for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended at approximately 2 mg of protein/ml. The initial supernatant was centrifuged at 48,000 ×g max for 20 min, yielding a pellet of high density microsomal membranes (HDM). The supernatant was then recentrifuged at 212,000 × g max for 70 min, yielding a second pellet of low density microsomal membranes (LDM), and the remaining supernatant was condensed by Centricon-30 and used as cytosol. All pellets were resuspended in 1–10 ml of buffer and repelleted before final resuspension at 1 mg of protein/ml. Isolated adipocytes were prepared, and some were stimulated with insulin as described above. Subcellular fractions were separated as described above, and precipitated fractions were resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 34 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from aliquots of the supernatant containing 1 mg of protein with anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, anti-IRS-3, or 4G10 antibodies, respectively, followed by protein A-Sepharose 6MB. The assays of PI 3-kinase activities in the immunoprecipitates were performed as described previously (15Anai M. Funaki M. Ogihara T. Terasaki J. Inukai K. Katagiri H. Fukushima Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Isolated adipocytes were prepared, and some were stimulated with insulin as described above. For total cellular homogenates, isolated adipocytes were homogenized in ice-cold buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and kept on ice for 30 min. The homogenates were subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, the solidified fat cake was removed carefully, and the supernatants were used as samples. Subcellular fractions were separated as described above, and precipitated fractions were resuspended in ice-cold buffer B. The protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and the concentrations were adjusted to 1 mg/ml. IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from each supernatant containing 1 mg of protein with 2 μg/ml anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, anti-IRS-3, or 4G10 antibodies, respectively, followed by protein A-Sepharose 6MB, so that the efficiency of immunoprecipitation was the same among the samples of fractions. In some experiments, anti-IRS-3 antibody was chemically cross-linked with protein A-Sepharose 4FF to decrease the amount of immunoglobulin heavy chain in the immunoprecipitate and to detect the amount of IRS-3 protein the in immunoprecipitates. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer B and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Aliquots of samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% or 10%). Electrotransfer of proteins from the gel to PVDF membrane was performed for 3 h at 80 V (constant); immunoblotting with each of the aforementioned antibodies was performed with Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL), and band intensities were quantified with a PhosphorImager GS-525 using Imaging Screen CH. In vitro transcription for riboprobe and RNase protection assay was performed as described previously (15Anai M. Funaki M. Ogihara T. Terasaki J. Inukai K. Katagiri H. Fukushima Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A rat IRS-3 cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 982–1526 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction based on the reported sequence. The 544 base pairs of rat IRS-3 cDNA were subcloned in pBluescript2 SK+ and used for in vitrotranscription. Pooled samples of 20 μg of total RNA from adipose tissue were used and hybridized with the riboprobe of IRS-1, IRS-2, or IRS-3. After treatment with RNase, the protected fragments were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide-urea gel, subjected to autoradiography, and the band intensities were determined by PhosphorImager GS-525 using Imaging Screen BI. To determine the efficiency of immunoprecipitation with anti-IRS-3 antibody, the amount of IRS-3 in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation was determined. As shown in Fig. 1, IRS-3 in the second immunoprecipitation was only 6% of that in the first. These results indicate that the anti-IRS-3 antibody used in this study immunodepleted IRS-3 from the cell lysate effectively. The specificity of anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 antibody was demonstrated. As shown in Fig. 1 B, IRS-1 was detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, whereas IRS-1 was not detected in anti-IRS-2 immunoprecipitates by anti-IRS-1 immunoblotting. IRS-2 was also detected in anti-IRS-2 immunoprecipitates, although it was not detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). These results indicate that the anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 antibodies used in this study recognized specific proteins. The subcellular localization of IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3 protein in isolated adipocytes was investigated in the presence or absence of insulin stimulation. After homogenization, the cell lysate of fat cells was fractionated into fractions of PM, HDM, LDM, and cytosol. Indicated amounts of protein from each fraction were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, electrophoresed, and immunoblotting was performed using the specific antibody against IRS-1, IRS-2, or IRS-3 (Figs. 2 A,3 A, and 4, top panel, respectively). IRS-1 and IRS-2 were revealed to be most abundant in the LDM sample. In contrast, IRS-3 was more abundant in the PM sample and was also present in the LDM sample.Figure 3Subcellular localization of IRS-2 in isolated adipocytes. The epididymal fat pad was excised, and adipocytes were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Isolated adipocytes were incubated with or without insulin for 5 min at 37 °C, and PM, LDM, HDM, and cytosol (Cyt) were prepared as described. Aliquots of each fraction (1 mg) were incubated with anti-IRS-2 antibody and subsequently precipitated by adding protein A-Sepharose 4FF. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-IRS-2, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), and anti-p85 antibody to measure IRS-2 protein (panel A), tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 (panel B), and p85α associated with IRS-2 (panel C), respectively.

The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 was detected mainly in the LDM sample, whereas that of IRS-3 was detected more strongly in the PM sample than in the LDM sample. These results of phosphorylation level are in good accordance with the results of the subcellular distribution of each IRS protein. Similar results were obtained regarding the amount of p85α, a regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, associated with each of the IRS proteins, when stimulated with insulin. In the insulin-stimulated condition, p85α associated with IRS-1 and IRS-2 was detected predominantly in the LDM sample (Figs. 2 C and 3 C, respectively), whereas that associated with IRS-3 was detected mainly in the PM, but a smaller amount was also detectable in the LDM sample (Fig. 4, second panel from bottom). The subcellular localization of PI 3-kinase activity in anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, and anti-IRS-3 antibody immunoprecipitates from isolated adipocytes was investigated (Figs. 2 D, 3 D, and 4, bottom panel, respectively). Enhancement of the kinase activity by insulin stimulation was observed irrespective of the fraction. In anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 antibody immunoprecipitates, the majority of PI 3-kinase activity was detected in LDM, and the activity in the PM samples was less than 10% of that in the LDM samples. In contrast, PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-3 was detected mainly in the PM, and a much lower activity was detected in the LDM samples. Taking the different total amounts of protein obtained from each of the subcellular fractions into consideration, the distribution of each IRS protein, the tyrosine phosphorylation level, and PI 3-kinase protein and activity associated with each IRS protein were calculated in whole PM, LDM, HDM, and cytosol fractions and are summarized in Table I. Briefly, 74% and 69% of the PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 and IRS-2, respectively, were detected in the LDM fraction in the insulin-stimulated condition, whereas 77% of that associated with IRS-3 was detected in the PM fraction.Table IProtein characteristics in IRSProteinPMLDMHDMCytosolInsulin(−)(+)(−)(+)(−)(+)(−)(+)IRS-1651043 Phosphorylation8173152011430 p85α binding271459141130 PI 3-kinase activity91919741502IRS-2660133 Phosphorylation11116600133 p85α binding47226233828 PI 3-kinase activity715386956510IRS-35225167 Phosphorylation21371331211921 p85α binding1535513193143 PI 3-kinase activity2577101251001Based on the data presented in Figs.

The data are presented so that total amounts or activities in the whole cell are 100% for each IRS protein in the insulin-stimulated condition. Open table in a new tab Based on the data presented in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and the total amounts of protein prepared as the samples of PM, LDM, HDM, and cytosol, the distribution of the protein, tyrosine phosphorylation level, associated PI 3-kinase protein, and activity in each fraction were calculated for each of IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3. The data are presented so that total amounts or activities in the whole cell are 100% for each IRS protein in the insulin-stimulated condition. It is well known that a high fat diet induces the enlargement of adipocytes and also insulin resistance in glucose uptake. A diet high in fat or a normal diet was given to rats for 2 weeks, and epididymal fat cells were used to investigate the regulation of expression levels of IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3. An RNase protection assay and immunoblotting were performed to measure the amounts of mRNA and protein, respectively. The high fat diet decreased mRNA levels of IRS-1 and IRS-2 by 24 and 27% (Fig. 5, A and B), respectively, compared with the controls, whereas the mRNA level of IRS-3 was up-regulated significantly by 49% (Fig. 5 C). Similar regulation was observed regarding the protein levels. IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins in high fat-fed rat adipocytes were revealed to be decreased by 27 and 52%, respectively, compared with the controls (Fig. 5, D and E), whereas IRS-3 protein level was increased by 282% (Fig. 5 F). These results indicate that the expression level of IRS-3 is regulated differently from that of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and that these different regulations are likely to act at the transcriptional level. LDM and PM fractions were prepared from adipocytes of high fat-fed rats and control rats. The amount of IRS-1 in the PM of normal diet rats was 11% of that in LDM (Fig. 6 A). The amount of IRS-1 in the adipocytes of high fat-fed rats in both PM and LDM was decreased by 31 and 74%, respectively, compared with the controls. Thus, the effect of a high fat diet on IRS-1 protein amount was more pronounced in LDM. IRS-2 expression was also dominant in the LDM in adipocytes of normal diet rats. The high fat diet reduced the IRS-2 protein level in both PM and LDM compared with normal diet by 24 and 59%, respectively. Taken together, in high fat-fed rat adipocytes, the decreases in IRS-1 and IRS-2 content were more marked in the LDM fraction than those in the PM fraction. In contrast, the amount of IRS-3 protein was demonstrated to be increased similarly in both PM (by 62%) and LDM fractions (by 26%). The PI 3-kinase activity associated with anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, and anti-IRS-3 immunoprecipitates was determined. The high fat diet decreased the PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 and IRS-2 after insulin stimulation in the LDM by 46 and 43%, respectively. In contrast, the PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-3 after insulin stimulation was significantly increased in both LDM and PM fractions by high fat diet. Panel C of Fig. 7demonstrates the PI 3-kinase activity associated with anti-IRS-3 immunoprecipitates. The high fat diet increased PI 3-kinase activity associated with anti-IRS-3 immunoprecipitates in the basal state (PM, 1.7-fold; LDM, 1.9-fold). Insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activation associated with anti-IRS-3 immunoprecipitates was also increased by a high fat diet in both PM and LDM (PM, 1.5-fold; LDM, 2.4-fold). PI 3-kinase activity associated with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates may represent the increment of those (associated with) anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, and anti-IRS-3 immunoprecipitates. Fig. 7 D demonstrates that insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activation associated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was decreased in both PM and LDM in high fat-fed rats by 10 and 40%, respectively. Insulin exerts numerous cellular activities in various cells. Insulin signaling is initiated by the binding of insulin to its specific receptor on the cell surface. By the activated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, several substrates reportedly are phosphorylated on their tyrosine residues. In rat adipocytes, not only IRS-1 and IRS-2, but also pp60, were found to be major substrates of the insulin receptor (1Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E868-E873PubMed Google Scholar, 3Remesar X. Rafecas I. Fernandez-Lopez J.A. Alemany M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, pp60 was cloned from rat and mouse adipocytes and termed IRS-3 (11Sciacchitano S. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4931-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). IRS-3 was shown to contain an amino-terminal PH domain, followed by a PTB domain, and these domains are highly homologous (about 50% identical amino acids) to those of IRS-1 and IRS-2 (11Sciacchitano S. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4931-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition, there is conservation of many tyrosine phosphorylation motifs responsible for interactions with downstream signaling molecules containing SH2 domains including PI 3-kinase, SHP2, and Grb-2 (12Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, to date no functional difference of IRS-3 from IRS-1 and IRS-2 has been reported. IRS-3 mRNA is expressed abundantly in adipocytes and hepatocytes but is also highly expressed in the first part of embryonic life, when IRS-1 mRNA is barely detected (11Sciacchitano S. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4931-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These results suggest that IRS-3 may be responsible not only for the regulation of metabolic functions in adipocytes and hepatocytes but also for differentiation and/or proliferation. In this study we used specific antibodies for IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3 and determined the subcellular localization of these proteins and PI 3-kinase activity mediated by each of these insulin receptor substrates. Insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 and IRS-2 was located mainly in the LDM (74 and 69% of total activity in cells, respectively), whereas it was barely detected in plasma membrane (19 and 15% of total activity in cells, respectively) (Table I). In fact, IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins were barely detected in PM. Because increased amounts of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in the LDM were not detected in our experimental condition, PI 3-kinase activation associated with IRS-1 and IRS-2 in LDM resulted from an increase in the PI 3-kinase associated with the YMXM motif in IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by insulin. Heller-Harrison et al. (18Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) reported that insulin action on 3T3-L1 adipocytes progressively decreased the amount of IRS-1 protein associated with the LDM fraction. Although we could not observe a similar decrease in IRS-1 in the LDM of isolated rat adipocytes, we speculate that this contradiction may be caused by differences of the cell types and/or experimental conditions such as serum starvation. In contrast to the case of IRS-1 and IRS-2, IRS-3 protein was detected in both PM and LDM, irrespective of stimulation with insulin. As reflected by the subcellular distribution of IRS-3, 77% of the PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-3 in the whole cell was detected in the PM fraction, and only 12% was in the LDM fraction (Table I). Thus, only IRS-3 efficiently contributes to the insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activation on the plasma membrane in adipocytes. Although it remains unclear how the subcellular distributions of these signaling molecules are determined, it seems that the PH domain plays an important role in anchoring the protein to the membrane via its association with phospholipid (19Burks D.J. Pons S. Towery H. Smith-Hall J. Myers Jr., M.G. Yenush L. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27716-27721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Brooks J. Glasheen E.M. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11715-11718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the PTB domain of IRS proteins is reportedly essential for association with the insulin receptor (21Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, the NH2-terminal portion containing the PH domain and PTB domain could have some role in determining the location of IRS proteins. However, because these portions are highly conserved between IRS-3 and IRS-1/2, it is quite unlikely that these portions contribute to their different subcellular distributions. Because there is no extended homology in the portion outside the PH and PTB domains between IRS-3 and either IRS-1 or IRS-2, it seems reasonable to consider that there is a region other than PH and PTB domains responsible for the different subcellular distributions. Further study is necessary to clarify this issue. Insulin induces numerous cell activities in adipose tissue, which include cell proliferation and differentiation, stimulation of glucose and amino acid uptake, inhibition of lipolysis and translocation of various membrane proteins such as transferrin receptor and insulin-like growth factor II receptor, and synthesis and/or secretion of leptin (1Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Am. J.

Among them, insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activation plays a critical role in the translocation of GLUT4 from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface (4Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 529-546PubMed Google Scholar, 5Czech M.P. Clancy B.M. Pessino A. Woon C.W. Harrison S.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 197-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). In addition, Yang et al. (7Yang J. Clarke J.F. Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) suggested that PI 3-kinase activation in the intracellular compartment, but not on the PM, is necessary for the translocation of GLUT4, because treatment with epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor, which stimulate PI 3-kinase activity in the whole cell as strongly as insulin, failed to induce translocation of the glucose transporter to the cell surface as fully as that with insulin (7Yang J. Clarke J.F. Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Assuming that this is the case, PI 3-kinase activation on the plasma membrane by IRS-3 may not contribute to insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation, but one in LDM by IRS-1 and IRS-2 may be much more important to contribute to insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. A high fat diet is one of the major causes inducing insulin resistance with respect to the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface (22Terasaki J. Anai M. Funaki M. Shibata T. Inukai K. Ogihara T. Ishihara H. Katagiri H. Onishi Y. Sakoda H. Fukushima Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T.

We demonstrated that high fat diet up-regulates IRS-3 but down-regulates IRS-1 and IRS-2. As reflected by these altered expression levels, PI 3-kinase activation associated with IRS-1 and IRS-2 was decreased markedly, whereas that associated with IRS-3 was increased. Because IRS-3 and IRS-1/2 are located mainly in the PM and LDM, respectively, as a consequence of their altered expression levels, insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activation is impaired markedly in the LDM, whereas that on the PM is maintained. We speculate that this abnormality in the portion in the cell where PI 3-kinase activation occurs may be one of the mechanisms causing insulin resistance in high fat diet-induced insulin resistance, in terms of glucose uptake. Although the role of PI 3-kinase activation on the PM induced by IRS-3 in adipocytes remains unclear, several possibilities can be raised. Treatment of adipocytes with platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or fibroblast growth factor reportedly induces a decrease in the number of developing fat cells and the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a marker of adipocyte differentiation (27Hauner H. Rohrig K. Petruschke T. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, this inhibitory action regarding the adipocyte differentiation was associated with markedly potent stimulation of cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect of platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor on adipocyte differentiation was suggested to be induced by the reduction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ1 transcriptional activity caused by phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ1 by mitogen-activated protein kinase (28Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Taking these previous reports into consideration, it can be speculated that IRS-3 phosphorylated mainly on the plasma membrane, similarly to the receptors of epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor, may have a role promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting adipocyte differentiation. In addition to the functions of adipocytes discussed above, fat cells have more specific functions that are affected by insulin stimulation. It would be of great interest to clarify which IRS protein transduces the signal inducing the individual insulin-induced cell activity. Further study of this issue is needed."

This protein can be activated by a variety of stresses such as heat shock, heavy metals, or arsenite (4Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B.

The activated HSF binds to the promoters which contain the heat shock element (HSE) and then stimulates transcription (1Kingston R.E. Schuetz T.J. Larin Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1530-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Sorger P.K. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Nature. 1987; 329: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 12Zimarino V. Wu C. Nature. 1987; 327: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A fundamental question which remains unanswered is how these stresses activate HSF. HSF is phosphorylated under normal growth conditions and is hyperphosphorylated subsequent to stress. It has been proposed that such phosphorylation may be mediated through the MAP kinase family such as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (13Kim J. Nueda A. Meng Y.H. Dynan W.S. Mivechi N.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated that the JNK, also referred to as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), signal transduction pathway can be activated by oxidative stress (14Cui X.-L. Douglas J.G.

Following activation, JNK phosphorylates several transcription factors including activating transcription factor-2 (17Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recent studies also show that oxidative stress can activate HSF and increaseHSP70 gene expression (25Gomer C.J. Ryter S.W. Ferrario A. Rucker N. Wong S. Fisher A.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2355-2360PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest a possibility that oxidative stress-induced activation of HSF is mediated through the SAPK pathway. We have previously observed that glucose deprivation increases intracellular hydroperoxide production and oxidized glutathione in drug-resistant human breast carcinoma MCF-7/ADR cells (26Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Chen J.C. Davis B.H. Sim J.E. Corry P.M. Spitz D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5294-5299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These results led us to investigate the possibility that glucose deprivation-induced metabolic oxidative stress may activate HSF through the SAPK pathway and result in hsp gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that glucose deprivation induces HSP genes, in particular inducible HSP70 gene expression as well as JNK activation. Studies with the bcl-2 gene or dominant-negative JNK1 mutant transfected cells indicate that metabolic oxidative stress-induced HSP70 gene expression is mediated through the SAPK pathway. Multidrug-resistant human breast carcinoma (MCF-7/ADR) cells were cultured in McCoy's 5a medium with 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 26 mm sodium bicarbonate for monolayer cell culture. Two or three days prior to the experiment, cells were plated into 60-mm Petri dishes or T-25 flasks. The Petri dishes/flasks containing cells were kept in a 37 °C humidified incubator with a mixture of 95% air and 5% CO2. For survival determination, the T-25 flasks containing monolayers of asynchronous cells were trypsinized with ice-cold 0.05% trypsin in Hanks' balanced salt solution and 0.53 mm EDTA. After trypsinization, the cells were resuspended in 3 ml of McCoy's 5a medium containing 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum. Cell counts were determined with a Coulter counter, and appropriate dilutions were made. The appropriate number of cells were plated into two replicate T-25 flasks for clonogenic cell survival assay. After 1–2 weeks of incubation at 37 °C, colonies were stained and counted. Data were normalized to sham treated control plating efficiencies. Cells were rinsed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution which took approximately 10 min. Cells were then treated with glucose-free McCoy's 5A medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Monolayer cells were heated in a hot water bath as described previously (27Lee Y.J. Dewey W.C. Radiat. Res. 1986; 106: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were plated 2 days before experiments at a concentration of 4 × 105cells/60-mm culture dish. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-JNK1 (APF) or pCMV–bcl-2 vector (20 μg) by using LipofectinTM Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The pcDNA3-FLAG-JNK1 (APF) vector contains a dominant-negative mutant of JNK1 with a NH2-terminal FLAG tag, which was kindly provided by Dr. R. Davis (Howard Hughes Medical Institute Research Laboratories, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA). The pCMV-bcl-2 vector containing the bcl-2 gene was provided by Dr. S. J. Korsmeyer (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Cells were labeled with 20 μCi/ml [3H]leucine (specific activity 160 Ci/mmol, Amersham) in leucine-free medium. After labeling, cells were washed twice with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. For one-dimensional PAGE, samples were mixed with 2 × Laemmli lysis buffer (1 × = 2.4 m glycerol, 0.14 m Tris, pH 6.8, 0.21m SDS, 0.3 mm bromphenol blue), and boiled for 10 min. Protein content was measured with BCA* Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The samples were diluted with 1 × lysis buffer containing 1.28 m β-mercaptoethanol and an equal amount of protein (30 μg) was applied to a one-dimensional PAGE. Electrophoresis was carried out on a 10–18% linear gradient SDS-PAGE. For two-dimensional PAGE, samples were solubilized in sample buffer containing 8 m urea, 1.7% Nonidet P-40, and 4.3% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were first separated in isoelectric focusing gels (pH 3.5–10). These gels were then laid across the top of a 10–18% linear gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel for two-dimensional analysis (28Walker J.M. Walker J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. 1. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1984: 57-61Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were fixed in 30% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min. For fluorography, gels were dehydrated by washing for 15 min in each of 25% acetic acid, 50% acetic acid, and glacial acetic acid, consecutively. After fixation, gels were placed in 125 ml of PPO solution (20% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole in glacial acetic acid) for 2 h. The PPO solution was removed, and the gel was shaken gently overnight in distilled water and dried for 2.5 h at 60 °C. The gel was loaded into a cassette with Kodak SB-5 x-ray film and placed in a −70 °C freezer. After optimum exposure time, the fluorograph film was developed with Kodak GBX developer and fixed with Kodak GBX fixer. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting using 0.12 A and 30 V overnight. The membrane was then incubated in blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin for non-ECL system or 5% dry milk for ECL system) for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with anti-bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:1,000 for ECL system; Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, CT), anti-ACTIVETM JNK polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:5,000 for ECL system; Promega, Madison, WI), or anti-actin monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:10,000; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). After incubation with the primary antibody, the membrane was washed, and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit-anti-mouse IgG (diluted 2,000; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) for 1–2 h or biotinylated sheep anti-mouse IgG/donkey anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:2, 500-7, 500; Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) for 1–2 h followed by streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (1:4,000; Amersham). The membrane was then stained using either nitro blue tetrazolium and 5′-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate or the detection reagent of the ECL detection kit (Amersham). HSP70and HSP28 mRNA levels were determined using the Northern blot technique. Total cellular RNA was extracted by the LiCl-urea method of Tushinskiet al. (29Tushinski R. Sussman P., Yu, L. Bancroft F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2357-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For RNA analysis, 30 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel (30Lehrach H. Diamond L. Wozney J. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2399) Google Scholar). The RNA was blotted from the gels onto nitrocellulose membranes and baked at 80 °C for 2 h in a vacuum oven. Membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 25 mm KPO4 (pH 7.4), 5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), and 50 μg/ml denatured and fragmented salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations were at 42 °C in prehybridization solution containing 10% dextran sulfate and radiolabeled HSP70, HSP28, GAPDH cDNA probes at a concentration of 1–2 × 106 cpm/ml. For post-hybridization, blots were washed twice in 2 × SSC for 15 min at room temperature, washed once in 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 25 min at 50 °C, and washed twice in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 50 °C. Blots were placed into a stainless steel cassette with intensifying screen and autoradiographed. Conditions for the gel mobility shift assay, a description of the 32P-labeled HSE oligonucleotide, and preparation of whole cell extracts were as published previously (31Demay M.B. Kiernan M.S.

Binding reactions with 20 μg of whole cell extracts for HSE were performed for 15 min at 25 °C in a final volume of 25 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol for HSF; 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 15% glycerol, 2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 20 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol for HSE) containing about 0.5 ng of radiolabeled probe, 10 μg of yeast tRNA (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN), 1 μg of Escherichia coli DNA (Sigma), 2 μg of poly(d[I-C]) (Pharmacia LKB, Piscataway, NJ), 50 μg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Samples were electrophoresed on a nondenaturing 4.5% polyacrylamide gel for 2.5 h at 140 V. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed with 7.5% acetic acid for 15 min and rinsed with water for 3 min. For autoradiography, gels were dried in a slab gel dryer (Model 483, Bio-Rad) for 1.5 h at 80 °C and placed into a stainless steel cassette with an intensifying screen. Gels were autoradiographed on Fuji RX x-ray film. After an exposure of 2–4 days at −70 °C, autoradiographic film was developed with Kodak GBX developer, and fixed with Kodak GBX fixer. To investigate whether glucose deprivation can activate heat shock gene expression, MCF-7/ADR cells were exposed to glucose-free medium for 1 h and then incubated in complete medium before harvest. Relative levels of HSP70 and HSP28 mRNA were determined using the Northern blot technique. Equal loading of the RNA was confirmed by rehybridizing the nitrocellulose membrane with a probe for the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Northern blots in Fig. 1 show significant differences in the intrinsic level of HSP70 and HSP28 mRNA. A low level of HSP70 mRNA was detected in untreated control cells. In contrast, a much higher level of HSP28mRNA was detected in these cells. The levels of both mRNAs increased rapidly and reached a maximal value within 2 h after glucose deprivation for 1 h. The level of HSP70 orHSP28 mRNA increased approximately 22- or 1.5-fold, respectively, as determined by densitometry. Similar results were observed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2). To investigate the glucose deprivation-induced synthesis of heat shock proteins, cells were labeled for 2–8 h with [3H]leucine after glucose deprivation for 1 h. Fluorography of an SDS-PAGE of [3H]leucine-labeled proteins shows that the level of HSP70 significantly increased and reached its maximum value within 4 h after glucose deprivation for 1 h. Unlike HSP70, the level of HSP28 protein was not detectably altered. These results were confirmed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3). For this study, cells were either heated at 45 °C for 15 min or exposed to glucose-free medium for 1 h and then labeled with [3H]leucine for 6 h. The results from two-dimensional SDS-PAGE clearly demonstrated that glucose deprivation induced a significant increase in the level of inducible HSP70 but not constitutive HSP70 (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, the level of both HSP70s increased after heat shock (Fig. 3 B). These two forms of HSP70 which can be separated by their molecular size and charge are highly related to each other. The constitutive HSP70, 73 kDa, is an abundant protein in the normal unstressed cell. The inducible HSP70, 72 kDa, is synthesized at very high levels after stress. In most cells, synthesis of the inducible HSP70 occurs only after stress. However, in human cells, synthesis of both constitutive and inducible HSP70 is observed in cells grown under normal conditions (Fig. 3 A).Figure 2One-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of proteins. MCF-7/ADR cells were exposed to glucose-free medium for 1 h and then labeled with 20 μCi/ml [3H]leucine in complete medium for 2–8 h, as indicated at the bottom of each lane.

Mak J.Y. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3816-3824PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether glucose deprivation-induced heat shock proteins can enhance resistance to stresses, MCF-7/ADR cells were exposed to glucose-free medium for 1 h and then incubated for various times in complete medium before being challenged to glucose deprivation for 4 h (Fig. 4) or heat shock at 45 °C for 1 h (Fig. 5). Survival fraction was plotted as a function of various times (2–16 h) between pretreatment and challenge treatment. Data from Figs. 4 and 5show that tolerance rapidly developed within 5 h and was maintained over 16 h. The time course for development of tolerance was similar for the two types of stress. For example, tolerance to glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity was observed as a 15-fold increase in survival from 4 × 10−2 to 6 × 10−1 after 8 h in complete medium (Fig. 4). In parallel, thermotolerance was observed as a 17-fold increase in survival from 4 × 10−2 to 7 × 10−1 after 8 h in complete medium (Fig. 5).Figure 5The time course for thermotolerance development by glucose deprivation. ▪, cells were incubated for various intervals (2–16 h) in complete medium after pretreatment with glucose-free medium for 1 h and then challenged to heat shock at 45 °C for 1 h. ■, cells were heated at 45 °C for 1 h without pretreatment.

We have also observed that overexpression of bcl-2 prevents an increase in oxidized glutathione content which is an indicator of oxidative stress (data not shown). In this study, we investigated whether overexpression of bcl-2 prevents glucose deprivation-induced heat shock gene expression. For this study, cells were transfected with plasmid pCMV-bcl-2 containing the human BCL-2 cDNA gene and then stable transfectants were selected. Fig. 6 shows an overexpression of bcl-2 in pCMV-bcl-2 (pBcl-2) vector transfected cells. The level of bcl-2 did not significantly change during incubation in complete medium after 1 h of glucose deprivation in control vector pCMV (pNeo) or pBcl-2-transfected cells. Effects of overexpression of bcl-2 on glucose deprivation-induced synthesis of heat shock proteins was observed in these transfected cells (Fig. 7). Data from two-dimensional SDS-PAGE show that glucose deprivation-induced inducible HSP70 gene expression was markedly reduced in pBcl-2 transfected cells (Fig. 7). To determine whether the suppression of HSP70 gene expression was due to the alteration of upstream regulation of transcription, HSF-HSE binding activity was measured by gel mobility shift assay. It is known that the binding of HSF to HSE is necessary for transcriptional activation of eukaryotic heat shock genes (5Sorger P.K. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B.

Gel mobility shift analysis of whole cell extracts from glucose-deprived cells showed the formation of the HSF-HSE complex (Fig. 8). The HSF binding activity was markedly reduced in pBcl-2 transfected cells. This may be due to inhibition of the signal transduction pathway by reducing oxidative damage in pBcl-2-transfected cells. It is well known that metabolic oxidative stress induces the SAPK pathway (37Mendelson K.G. Contois L.-R. Tevosian S.G. Davis R.J. Paulson K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Glucose deprivation which is known to induce metabolic oxidative stress activates HSF and subsequently induces heat shock gene expression, in particular inducible HSP70 gene expression (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and 8). These results are consistent with observations which demonstrate that oxidative stress can activate HSF and induceHSP70 gene expression (25Gomer C.J. Ryter S.W. Ferrario A. Rucker N. Wong S. Fisher A.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2355-2360PubMed Google Scholar). These observations were confirmed by overexpression of bcl-2 which may regulate an antioxidant pathway at sites of free radical generation (38Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D.

https://openalex.org/W1983402179,"Proenkephalin-A (PEA) and its derived peptides (PEAP) have been described in neural, neuroendocrine tissues and immune cells. The processing of PEA has been extensively studied in the adrenal medulla chromaffin cell showing that maturation starts with the removal of the carboxyl-terminal PEAP209–239. In 1995, our laboratory has shown that antibacterial activity is present within the intragranular chromaffin granule matrix and in the extracellular medium following exocytosis. More recently, we have identified an intragranular peptide, named enkelytin, corresponding to the bisphosphorylated PEAP209–237, that inhibits the growth of Micrococcus luteus (Goumon, Y., Strub, J. M., Moniatte, M., Nullans, G., Poteur, L., Hubert, P., Van Dorsselaer, A., Aunis, D., and Metz-Boutigue, M. H. (1996) Eur. J. Biochem. 235, 516–525). As a continuation of this previous study, in order to characterize the biological function of antibacterial PEAP, we have here examined whether this COOH-terminal fragment is released from stimulated chromaffin cells and whether it could be detected in wound fluids and in polymorphonuclear secretions following cell stimulation. The antibacterial spectrum shows that enkelytin is active against several Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, but it is unable to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria growth. In order to relate the antibacterial activity of enkelytin with structural features, various synthetic enkelytin-derived peptides were tested. We also propose a computer model of synthetic PEAP209–237 deduced from 1H NMR analysis, in order to relate the antibacterial activity of enkelytin with the three-dimensional structure. Finally, we report the high phylogenetic conservation of the COOH-terminal PEAP, which implies some important biological function and we discuss the putative importance of enkelytin in the defensive processes."
https://openalex.org/W1983311624,"Although cadherins appear to be necessary for proper cell-cell contacts, the physiological role of VE-cadherin (vascular endothelium cadherin) in adult tissue has not been clearly determined. To shed some light on this question, we have disturbed the adhesive function of VE-cadherin in human endothelial cell culture using a polyclonal anti-VE-cadherin antibody. This antibody disrupts confluent endothelial cell monolayers in vitro and transiently generates numerous gaps at cell-cell junctions. The formation of these gaps correlates with a reversible increase in the monolayer permeability. We present evidence that destruction of the homotypic interactions between the extracellular domains of VE-cadherin induces a rapid resynthesis of VE-cadherin, leading to restoration of endothelial cell-cell contacts. The expression of new molecules of VE-cadherin correlates with a modest but significant increase in VE-cadherin mRNA synthesis. Altogether, these results establish a critical role for VE-cadherin in the maintenance and restoration of endothelium integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2068238048,"Abstract We have previously identified a DNase I-hypersensitive site in the T cell receptor β locus, designated HS1, that is located 400 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional enhancer Eβ and is induced during CD4−CD8− to CD4+CD8+thymocyte differentiation. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we show that HS1 induction correlates with increased binding of two nuclear factors, Cux/CDP and SATB1, to a 170-base pair DNA sequence within HS1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HS1 is a nuclear matrix attachment region, referred to as MARβ. These findings demonstrate that an analogous organization of cis-regulatory elements in which a nuclear matrix attachment region is in close proximity to an enhancer is conserved in the immunoglobulin and T cell receptor loci. In addition, we show that MARβ represses Eβ-dependent reporter gene expression in transient transfection assays. However, the targeted deletion of MARβ from the endogenous locus does not change T cell receptor β gene transcription in developing T cells. These contrasting results suggest a potential pitfall of functional studies of nuclear matrix attachment regions outside of their natural chromosomal context."
https://openalex.org/W1996394751,"The cytoplasmic calcium environments along membrane trafficking pathways leading to gap junction intercellular communication channels at the plasma membrane were studied. Connexins, the constitutive proteins of gap junctions, were fused at their carboxyl terminus to the calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin. The cellular location of the chimeric proteins was determined by immunolocalization and subcellular fractionation. The generation of functional gap junctions by the connexin chimerae was monitored by the ability of the cells to exchange small dyes. Although aequorin fused to connexin-26 was nonfunctional, its ability to report Ca2+ and to form functional gap junctions was rescued by replacement of its cytoplasmic carboxyl tail with that of connexin-43. In COS-7 cells expressing these connexin-aequorin chimerae, calcium levels below the plasma membrane were higher (∼5 μm) than those in the cytoplasm (∼100 nm); gap junctions were able to transfer dyes under these conditions. Cytoplasmic levels of free calcium surrounding the ERGIC/Golgi reported by connexin-43 chimera (∼420 nm) were twice those measured by connexin-32 chimera (∼200 nm); both chimerae measured calcium levels substantially higher than those reported by a connexin-26 chimera (∼130 nm). Dispersion of the ERGIC and Golgi complex by brefeldin A led to a marked reduction in calcium levels. The results show that the various connexin chimerae were located in spatially different subcellular stores and that the ERGIC/Golgi regions of the cell maintain heterogeneous cytoplasmic domains of calcium.

Gap junctions are pervasive intercellular channels that directly connect cells in tissues and organs allowing electrical coupling and the transfer of molecules and ions (<1 kDa) between cells (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Gap junction biogenesis requires the oligomerization of protein subunits (connexins) into a hexameric connexon and their trafficking to the plasma membrane. 14 connexins have been described in rodents, and all appear to have a common arrangement in the membrane (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Interactions between connexons from juxtaposed cells result in functional gap junction channels. Gap junctions have diverse integrative functions including roles in development, synchronous contraction of the heart, regulation of exocytosis, and control of cell growth (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Mutations in connexins or defective production of gap junctions are associated with deafness (2Kelsell D.P. Dunlop J. Stevens H.P. Lench N.J. Liang J.N. Parry G. Mueller R.F. Leigh I.M.

Membrane Protein Assembly. Chapman and Hall, London1997: 119-133Google Scholar) and vesicular transport through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane (8Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Calcium is necessary for the oligomerization of membrane proteins such as annexin V (9Concha N.O. Head J.F.

Elevated levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in the vicinity of gap junctions result in closure of the channel (11Rose B. Loewenstein W.R.

Chen Y. Werner R. Gap Junctions. IOS Press, Netherlands1998: 3-7Google Scholar), intermediaries such as calmodulin (16Torok K. Stauffer K. Evans W.H. Biochem.

Yamasaki H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Gating of gap junction channels is also regulated by H+ ions, cAMP, voltage, and phosphorylation by protein kinase C (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Calcium waves are propagated intercellularly via gap junctions (19Boitano S. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. Science. 1992; 258: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To study the involvement of Ca2+ in connexon and gap junction formation and functioning, chimerae of connexin-26, -32, and -43 (Cx-Aeq) and the calcium-dependent photoprotein aequorin (20Kendall J.M. Badminton M.N. Trends Biotech. 1998; 16: 216-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) were synthesized by attaching aequorin to the carboxyl tail of connexin isoforms. The aequorin moiety was thus positioned to report the cytoplasmic calcium environment at the ER, Golgi, and gap junctions at the plasma membrane. Two chimerae, Cx32-Aeq and Cx43-Aeq, formed functional gap junction channels determined by dye transfer studies when expressed in HeLa cells, and they retained the chemiluminescent activity of aequorin. A chimera of Cx26 (Cx26-Aeq), however, did not form communication competent channels; the activity of the aequorin moiety was abolished (21Martin P.E.M. George C.H. Castro C. Kendall J.M. Capel J. Campbell A.K. Revilla A. Barrio L.C. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but replacing the carboxyl tail of Cx26 with that of Cx43 (Cx26/43T-Aeq) restored its ability to form gap junction channels. Importantly, it fully retained chemiluminescent aequorin activity and was thus able to report Ca2+levels. Aequorin has been targeted to the ER (22Kendall J.M. Badminton M.N. Dormer R.L. Campbell A.K.

Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Aequorin has also been targeted to the plasma membrane using different strategies, but protein trafficking pathways were not studied (28Daguzan C. Nicolas M.T. Mazars C. Leclerc C. Moreau M. Int. J.

These targeted aequorin constructs reveal differences between the calcium environments inside organelles, and they detected functionally separate calcium stores within the ER (24Button D. Eidsath A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Montero M. Alvarez J. Scheenen W.J. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J.

Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), suggest that heterogeneous calcium microenvironments play an important role in channel organization and trafficking between organelles. Here, we describe the use of Cx-Aeq chimerae to measure levels of free cytoplasmic calcium along protein trafficking pathways and at the cell surface following integration of the chimerae into the plasma membrane and the gap junction. PCR was used to generate fragments of Cx26 (35Zhang J.T. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3391-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and Cx32 (36Paul D.L. J.

Domain boundaries in connexins were deduced from Clustal V sequence alignment and current topological models (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Following incubation (30 min, 37 °C) with Klenow fragment (Promega), products were fused with PCR-generated fragments corresponding to the carboxyl tail of Cx43 with aequorin attached (Cx43-Aeq, aa 227–573) in a second stage amplification (21Martin P.E.M. George C.H. Castro C. Kendall J.M. Capel J. Campbell A.K. Revilla A. Barrio L.C. Evans W.H. J. Biol.

The chimeric DNA was ligated into the TA cloning vector PCR3 according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Constructs in which the aequorin was removed from Cx26/43T-Aeq and Cx32/43T-Aeq, thereby creating Cx26/43T and Cx32/43T, respectively (see Fig. 1), were produced using PCR, appropriate forward (sense) primers, and a reverse (antisense) primer (R43BglII, 5′-GCTCCTCTAGATTAAATAAATCTCCAGGTC-3′). The resultant products were incubated with Klenow fragment and ligated into PCR3 as described above. Sequences of oligonucleotide primers were as follows for Cx26/43T-Aeq (Cx26P1 sense, 5′-CAGCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGGATCCATGGATTGGGGCACA-3′; Cx26M4R antisense, 5′-GAAGAAGACGTAGAACAGCTGTGTGATGTT-3′; Cx26M4F sense, 5′-AACATCACAGAGCTGTTCTACGTCTTCTTC-3′; Pet-II antisense, 5′-CCCATCAGATCTTTAGGGGACAGCTCC-3′) and for Cx32/43T-Aeq (Cx (32Golovina V.A.

The DNAs encoding the domain-swapped constructs (1 μg) were transcribed and translated in vitro using a coupled rabbit reticulocyte TNT system (Promega), T7 polymerase (Promega), and35S- labeled methionine and cysteine (Promix, Nycomed-Amersham). Radiolabeled protein products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% (w/v) acrylamide) under reducing conditions followed by fluorography and exposure to x-ray film at −70 °C. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), amphotericin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (v/v). Cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 20 μg of DNA-encoding chimerae using a standard calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique. Cells were split onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips 18 h post-transfection and incubated in 5 mm sodium butyrate to increase expression of recombinant protein (37George C.H. Martin P.E.M.

Following incubation with primary antibody (1 h, 37 °C), cells were washed several times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, in mm: 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 10 Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and stained with fluoroscein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (1 h, room temperature). Cells were mounted in Fluorsave (Calbiochem) and viewed on a Leitz DMRBE confocal microscope. Transfected COS-7 cells (1 × 106) expressing the Cx-Aeq chimerae, were split into 3 × 100-mm dishes, propagated for 48 h, and processed as described (43Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). A postnuclear supernatant (1 ml) obtained by centrifuging the homogenate for 5 min at 1500 × g and 4 °C was applied to linear gradients prepared by mixing 3.8 ml of 24, 19.3, 14.6, and 10% (w/v) isotonic Nycodenz (Nycomed-Amersham) solutions dissolved in buffer (in mm: 150 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 EDTA; 10 Tris, pH 7.4). Non-linear density gradients were generated first by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C, and then the postnuclear supernatant was applied and centrifugation continued for a further 2 h. 16 (1-ml) fractions were collected and density and protein concentration determined. Fractions (500 μl) were incubated in the dark for 2 h with 500 μl of buffer O (in mm: 1 EDTA, 500 NaCl, 5 β-mercaptoethanol, 10 Tris, pH 7.4) and 2 μm coelenterazine (Molecular Probes). Aequorin chemiluminescence in each fraction was analyzed in a luminometer after the injection of saturating amounts of calcium (50 mm). Subcellular markers for ER (mannosyl transferase), Golgi (galactosyl transferase), and plasma membrane (5′ nucleotidase) were measured (29Nakahashi Y. Nelson E. Fagan K. Gonzales E. Guillou J.-L.

ERGIC distribution was by immunoblotting fractions using an anti- Golgi 58K protein monoclonal (Sigma) and detection with ECL (Pierce) by densitometric analysis. The formation of functional gap junction channels was determined by microinjection of the plasmid cDNA encoding each construct into nuclei of small colonies of HeLa cells (37George C.H. Martin P.E.M. Evans W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP;CLONTECH) was used to monitor injection efficiency. A single cell in a colony was injected with Lucifer yellow (LY, 5% (w/v) in 0.3 m LiCl) following expression of the recombinant protein. Dye transfer was quantified by counting the number of cells transferring dye to two or more cells after fixing cells 10 min postinjection in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA (20 μg of DNA per 1 × 106 cells) using a calcium phosphate procedure or infected with a recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus vector expressing a cytosolic firefly luciferase-apoaequorin chimera (LA) at a multiplicity of infection of 100 plaque forming units per cell (38Kendall J.M. Badminton M.N. Sala-Newby G.B. Wilkinson G.W.G. Campbell A.K. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 133-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 48 h later, the cells were washed extensively in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA followed by PBS supplemented with 50 μm EDTA, scraped into a hypo-osmotic extraction buffer (in mm: 0.5 EDTA, 5 β-mercaptoethanol, 20 Tris, pH 7.4), and freeze-thawed three times. The extracts were then centrifuged (10 min, 12,000 × g), and supernatants were dialyzed in zero Ca2+ buffer (pH 7.2) (Molecular Probes). Recombinant photoproteins were activated by incubation in the dark with 2 μm coelenterazine for 4 h at 4 °C. Light production from each chimera was measured in different Ca2+buffers (pH 7.2) (Molecular Probes) and calculated as rate constants from the total aequorin activity assessed in saturating concentrations of calcium (25Badminton M.N.

After the introduction of recombinant DNA encoding the Cx-Aeq chimerae or LA, COS-7 cells (1 × 105) were trypsinized 48 h later and transferred to glass coverslips. Sodium butyrate was added to cells approximately 18 h prior to commencement of experiments (37George C.H. Martin P.E.M. Evans W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To measure cytosolic domains of Ca2+([Ca2+]c) in cells expressing Cx-Aeq chimerae, recombinant apoaequorin was converted to the active photoprotein by adding coelenterazine (final concentration, 2 μm) at least 4 h prior to experiments. To measure Ca2+ directly under the plasma membrane ([Ca2+]pm), the recombinant photoproteins were activated by adding coelenterazine (2 μm) to cells in Ca2+ free medium containing 1 mm EGTA (30Marsault R. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The coverslips were mounted in a perfusion chamber at 37 °C and brought into contact with a fiber optics bundle attached to a photon counting camera (25Badminton M.N. Campbell A.K. Rembold C.M. J.

Cells were perfused for at least 10 min at 37 °C in KRH (in mm: 120 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.3 CaCl2, 25 HEPES, pH 7.4) or in KRH in which the CaCl2 had been replaced with 1 mm EGTA (KRH-Ca2+) to remove excess coelenterazine, prior to monitoring light emission. In measurements of [Ca2+]c, unconsumed aequorin was determined at the end of each experiment by exposing the cells to hypotonic buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 to calculate the fractional discharge of aequorin and to convert light emission into free concentrations of calcium (25Badminton M.N. Campbell A.K. Rembold C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31210-31214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In calculating [Ca2+]pm, after correcting for consumption of active photoprotein during the initial phase of Ca2+ influx, chemiluminescent activity due entirely to plasma membrane-associated Cx-Aeq chimerae was used. Rate constants (k) can be used to accurately determine calcium levels since the rate of change of Ca2+ in a cell is far slower than Ca2+ binding to aequorin (45Cobbold P.H. Lee J.A.C. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.C. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 55-81Google Scholar, 53Cobbold P.H. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Following consumption of >90% aequorin, rate constants generated were excluded from calculations (45Cobbold P.H. Lee J.A.C. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.C. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 55-81Google Scholar). DNA sequencing confirmed that the chimeric Cx-Aeq constructs contained no mutations, and in vitro transcription/translation generated35S-labeled recombinant proteins of the predicted size (Fig. 1). Micro-injection into nuclei of HeLa cells of the cDNA encoding Cx-Aeq chimerae and subsequent expression of recombinant protein was used to assess the gap junction-forming abilities of each chimera. Replacement of the carboxyl tail of Cx26 or Cx32 with that of Cx43 decreased the ability of Cx26/43T and Cx32/43T to transfer LY when compared with wild-type connexins (Table I). Attachment of aequorin to Cx26/43T and Cx32/43T did not further impair the communication competency of the intercellular channels formed (Table I). However, Cx26/43T-Aeq demonstrated a fully restored chemiluminescent emission from the aequorin moiety (>90% specific activity of wild-type aequorin) and an increased ability to be incorporated into gap junction channels when compared with Cx26-Aeq (Table I).Table ITransfer of LY by HeLa cells expressing Cx-Aeq chimeraecDNA injectedDye transfer%EGFP3.7 ± 1.4Cx26WT47.6 ± 8.3Cx32WT52.4 ± 13.3Cx43WT52.2 ± 11.5Cx26/43T-Aeq14.3 ± 5.7Cx26/43T19.2 ± 8.0Cx32/43T-Aeq18.5 ± 4.6Cx32/43T23.1 ± 9.7Cx26-Aeq4.1 ± 1.3Results are given as percentage of cells transferring dye to two or more neighbors (mean ± S.E., n > 30) following enhancement of recombinant protein expression with sodium butyrate.

Immunocytochemistry of COS-7 cells expressing Cx-Aeq chimerae stained with aequorin antibodies showed punctate staining at the plasma membrane. Cx32-Aeq, Cx43-Aeq, Cx26/43T-Aeq, and Cx32/43T-Aeq were also located in intracellular regions near the nucleus (Fig. 2, A—D, respectively, indicated with arrows). The intracellular accumulation of chimeric proteins is characteristic of many cultured cells expressing exogenous connexins (21Martin P.E.M. George C.H. Castro C. Kendall J.M. Capel J. Campbell A.K.

Cells stained with markers to ER (calreticulin, Fig. 2 E), ERGIC (p58, Fig. 2 F), and Golgi (GM130 and TGN46, Fig. 2, G and H, respectively) demonstrated that these intracellular stores of Cx-Aeq chimerae were localized to ERGIC/Golgi compartments. These results were further confirmed by the changes in subcellular location occurring following brefeldin A treatment. The drug redistributed the ERGIC and Golgi markers (Fig. 2, N and O, respectively) but not ER (Fig. 2 M). Brefeldin A redistributed Cx32-Aeq, Cx43-Aeq, and Cx32/43T-Aeq (Fig. 2, I, J, and L, respectively) in a similar manner suggesting that these Cx-Aeq chimerae were all localized in the ERGIC/Golgi region of the secretory pathway. Quantification of immunostaining by confocal microscopy indicated that there was a 90% decrease in plasma membrane-associated Cx-Aeq chimerae following brefeldin A treatment. In contrast, the brefeldin A-induced redistribution of Cx26/43T-Aeq was less marked than observed for the other Cx-Aeq chimerae, and some plasma membrane localization remained (Fig. 2 K, arrows). Since there was overlap in immunostaining of ERGIC and Golgi compartments in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2, F–H), a biochemical subcellular fractionation approach was adopted to independently analyze the cellular location of the various Cx-Aeq chimerae. Subcellular fractionation of COS-7 cells expressing the Cx-Aeq chimerae on Nycodenz density gradients resolved the ER, Golgi, and ERGIC regions of the cell (Fig. 3, A, B, and D, respectively) and confirmed the predominant ERGIC/Golgi localization of Cx32-Aeq, Cx43-Aeq, and Cx32/43T-Aeq chimerae (Fig. 3, E, F, and H, respectively). However, Cx26/43T-Aeq colocalized mainly with an ERGIC marker, and only a small proportion accumulated in the Golgi regions of the cell (∼20% of total Cx26/43T-Aeq protein was found in the Golgi compared with 76% of Cx32-Aeq and 81% of Cx43-Aeq) (Fig. 3 G). Despite its lower efficiency in forming gap junction channels, Cx26/43T-Aeq did not colocalize with an ER marker by subcellular fractionation. The distribution of Cx32/43T-Aeq in the Golgi-containing fractions of the gradient correlated closely wi"

Different PKB constructs that contain mutations or deletions in the PH domain were transfected into cells, and the results on the basal and insulin-induced kinase activities were analyzed. Deletion of the entire PH domain (ΔPH-PKB) did not impair the kinase activity; in contrast, the basal activity was elevated with respect to wild-type PKB. In addition, ΔPH-PKB was responsive to insulin, and as for wild-type PKB, this was dependent on phosphoinositide 3-kinase. By contrast, a point mutation within the PH domain that impairs phospholipid binding (R25C) resulted in a construct that was not responsive to insulin. However, this defect was overcome by mutations that mimic the phosphorylation state of the active kinase. The increase in the basal activity of ΔPH-PKB was shown to be due to an elevation in the level of phosphorylation of this construct. In addition, the subcellular localization of ΔPH-PKB, as determined by both immunofluorescence and fractionation, was predominately cytosolic, and ΔPH-PKB was present in the plasma membrane at much lower levels compared with wild-type PKB. These data show that phosphorylation is the major factor regulating the activity of PKB and that either removal of the PH domain or binding of phospholipids is required to permit this phosphorylation. In addition, membrane localization does not appear to be required for the activation process, but instead, binding of PKB to membrane phospholipids permits a conformational change in the molecule that allows for phosphorylation.

Protein kinase B (PKB),1also referred to as Akt or RAC kinase, is a serine/threonine protein kinase that was cloned by virtue of its homology to protein kinases A and C and is the cellular homolog of the product of the v-akt oncogene (1Staal S.

The activity of PKB in response to these agents is strictly dependent on the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) since (i) it is sensitive to wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K; (ii) mutants of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor that cannot interact with PI3K are incapable of PKB activation; and (iii) constitutively active forms of PI3K are able to activate PKB in intact cells (5Burgering B.M.T.

The effect of 3′-phosphoinositides is believed to be mediated in part by the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PKB. In addition, PI3K-independent activation of PKB has been demonstrated in response to heat shock, β-adrenergic receptor activation, and cAMP (8Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C.

The first identified substrate of PKB was glycogen-synthase kinase-3, which is inhibited in vivo after phosphorylation by PKB (11Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M.

This may be mediated in part by the ability of PKB to phosphorylate BAD, a protein implicated in cell survival decisions (24Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). Currently, a two-step model exists to explain stimulation of PKB in response to growth factors. First, the activation of PI3K subsequent to engagement of growth factor receptors leads to the production of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, which can then be dephosphorylated by a specific phospholipid phosphatase to PtdIns-3,4-P2 (26Whiteford C.C. Best C. Kazlauskas A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This phospholipid product has been shown to bind PKB via the PH domain and may serve to localize PKB to the plasma membrane and/or to directly activate the kinase (27Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 28Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8474-8481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Second, the activation of PKB requires phosphorylation of threonine 308 and serine 473 by two separate kinases (30Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). Recently, a kinase that phosphorylates PKB at Thr-308 has been identified by two independent groups (31Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). This kinase requires PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 to phosphorylate PKB and thus has been called phospholipid-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) (31Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B.

This describes a direct link between the products of PI3K and activation of a downstream event. At present, the involvement of the PH domain in the activation of PKB remains controversial. In addition to PKB, PH domains have been found in a large number of proteins; however, to date, their physiological role is not entirely clear (for reviews, see Refs. 34Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar and 35Lemmon M.A. Falasca M. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 237-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Generally, they interact with phospholipids, although in some cases, they have also been demonstrated to interact with proteins, most notably G protein βγ subunits (36Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because membrane localization has been shown to be important in regulating the function of many PH domain-containing proteins, it is proposed that this domain may serve as a membrane tether. In several proteins, the PH domain has been demonstrated to be crucial for proper function (37Myers Jr., M. Grammer T. Brooks J. Glasheen E. Wang L. Sun X. Blenis J. Pierce J. White M. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 261: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). However, in PKB, removal of the entire domain does not affect signaling through growth factor receptors (7Kohn A.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Despite this, smaller deletions and point mutations impairing phospholipid binding result in a kinase that is incapable of responding to stimulation by growth factors (6Franke T.F. Yang S.-I.

These data further complicate the definition of a PH domain function, but imply that it may exert an inhibitory effect that is relieved either by binding of phospholipids or by removal of the domain. In addition, the significance of the proposed translocation of PKB to the membrane in response to growth factor stimulation is questioned by these findings. It is thought that translocation may be important to localize PKB to the same compartment as activating kinases. At this time, the translocation of PKB in response to peroxyvanadate (40Wijkander J.

However, data showing that PKB without a PH domain (which presumably should not interact with the membrane) remains activable question whether membrane localization is necessary for activation. In this report, we attempt to further clarify the role of the PH domain in the activation of PKB. We show that a construct lacking the PH domain has an increase in its activity prior to stimulation that can be ascribed to a high level of basal phosphorylation. Furthermore, in contrast to wild-type PKB, ΔPH-PKB is found predominately in the cytosol, indicating that membrane localization is not necessary for the activation of PKB. These findings show that the PH domain of PKB plays a unique role in the activation process, and rather than localization, this domain appears to be involved in regulating the phosphorylation of PKB by upstream activating kinases.

The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature before being added dropwise to the cells. After incubation for 15–18 h at 35 °C under 3% CO2, the cells were then removed to an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 8 h before starvation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 14 h. Protocols for transfection of HeLa cells were essentially identical with the following exceptions. Cells were trypsinized and directly plated onto sterile glass coverslips at 100,000 cells/well in six-well tissue culture dishes. The next day, cells were transfected with 8 μg of DNA/well by the calcium phosphate method. Two days after transfection, cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Transfected 293-EBNA cells were stimulated or not with 1 μm insulin for 5 min. When appropriate, cells were preincubated with 100 nm wortmannin for 15 min. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 IU/ml aprotinin, 20 μmleupeptin, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated using an anti-hemagglutinin antibody (12CA5) coupled to protein G-Sepharose. After washing of the immunocomplexes, kinase activity was assayed using Crosstide (11Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar) as a substrate in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP, 30 μm Crosstide, and 3.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/assay. The phosphorylation reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C and was then stopped by spotting 40 μl onto Whatman P-81 filter papers and immersing in 1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid. The papers were washed several times, rinsed in ethanol, and air-dried, and the radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting. Background values obtained from a mixture lacking cell lysate were subtracted from all values. Where indicated, calf intestinal phosphatase (20 units) was added to the immunoprecipitates and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were extensively washed prior to the kinase assay. Transfected HeLa cells grown on coverslips were placed on ice and washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to fixation with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed, treated with 50 mm ammonium chloride, and rewashed. Staining of the membrane was accomplished by incubating the cells in a humid chamber for 30 min with rhodamine-conjugated WGA (10−7m). Coverslips were mounted onto slides using Mowiol and viewed using a Leica upright confocal microscope equipped with a Leica 100× objective (1.4 numerical aperture). The molecules were excited with the 600 line of an argon-krypton laser and imaged using either a 530-nm (GFP) or 600-nm (rhodamine) band-pass filter. Images were acquired with a scanning mode format of 256 × 256 pixels and recorded in the range of 0–255. The two confocal emission images were superimposed on a high-resolution monitor and photographed in pseudocolor mode using Kodak Ektachrome 100 ASA film. 293 cells transfected with PKB constructs were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 1 ml of 20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA including protease and phosphatase inhibitors using a Thomas-Potter type C homogenizer. Subcellular fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation as described (15Tanti J.-F. Grillo S. Grémeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotting with an anti-PKB antibody raised against a peptide containing amino acids 469–480 of PKB (provided by one of us (B. A. H.). Proteins were revealed using incubation with 125I-protein A followed by autoradiography. To study the role of the PH domain in the activation of PKB, we tested the kinase activity of two different PH domain mutants when overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (Fig. 1). Consistent with other reports, we found that the kinase activity was completely abolished in the R25C mutation, a point mutation within the PH domain that has been shown to impair binding to phospholipids (28Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). However, removal of the entire PH domain (Δ1–106) actually resulted in an enhancement of the kinase activity. Notably, the basal activity of this ΔPH-PKB construct was ∼4-fold that of wild-type PKB. However, due to the elevation in the basal activity of ΔPH-PKB, the enhancement of the kinase activity after insulin stimulation was not as pronounced as in the wild-type construct (11-fold for wild-type PKB versus 5.7-fold for ΔPH-PKB). These differences were not due to different levels of protein expression as judged by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The ability of this mutant to respond to insulin is consistent with other reports (7Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 16Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and demonstrates that the PH domain is dispensable for activation of PKB in response to insulin. We next wanted to determine whether the activation of ΔPH-PKB proceeds by mechanisms that are similar to those that also stimulate wild-type PKB. We first tested whether the activation of ΔPH-PKB was also PI3K-dependent by examining the effect of wortmannin on the kinase activity of this mutant in response to insulin. As shown in Fig. 2 A, wortmannin can completely inhibit the insulin-induced kinase activity of both wild-type PKB and ΔPH-PKB. These differences were not due to variation in the level of protein expression (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). However, wortmannin had no effect on the high basal activity of ΔPH-PKB. These results indicate that PKB can be activated by insulin in a PI3K-dependent manner via a mechanism that does not rely on the integrity of the PH domain. To further characterize the activity of ΔPH-PKB, we compared its kinetics of activation with those of wild-type PKB. Although ΔPH-PKB can be activated in response to insulin stimulation, we hypothesized that this process may be less efficient than for the wild-type enzyme, resulting in a delay in the kinetics. Previous reports have shown that PKB is activated rapidly in response to insulin and reaches a maximum by 5 min (11Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar). We also observed that, in our system, PKB was rapidly activated by insulin (Fig. 2 B). The time to maximal activation of ΔPH-PKB was similar to that of wild-type PKB, indicating that the stimulation occurs through similar mechanisms. Therefore, it is likely that ΔPH-PKB is phosphorylated by activating kinases equally efficiently as wild-type PKB and that the PH domain is not critical for recognition by this kinase(s). To date, the role of phospholipids in the activation of PKB is still not entirely clear. Since deletion of the PH domain of PKB does not impair the kinase activity, it appears that the interaction of phospholipids with PKB is not necessary for activation. However, R25C PKB lacks kinase activity (Fig. 1); this could be potentially due to a conformational change resulting from the mutation that renders the kinase inactive. To test whether this mutant is catalytically active, the two residues that are phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation were mutated to acidic amino acids to mimic the effect of phosphorylation (T308D and S473D). These mutations have been shown to result in a PKB that is constitutively active (30Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). We made these activating mutations within R25C PKB (R25C-CA) and tested the effect on the kinase activity (Fig. 3 A). The result of the mutations was an increase (4.5-fold) in the basal kinase activity when compared with wild-type PKB, which could not be further increased by insulin. In contrast with other reports, we found that these mutations in wild-type PKB did not result in a kinase that possessed activity equivalent to that after stimulation by insulin (Fig. 3 A). This could be due in part to the lower levels of expression of this mutant. Therefore, we also determined the kinase activity of the different constructs normalized to the protein expression (Fig. 3 B). From this, it is evident that the activities of constitutively active PKB and R25C-CA are similar and that R25C-CA is significantly more active than wild-type PKB. These data indicate that, once phosphorylated, PKB activity is no longer dependent upon interaction of the PH domain with phospholipids. This implies that the binding of phospholipids to the PH domain of PKB is a prerequisite for phosphorylation of the enzyme. We hypothesized that binding of phospholipids to the PH domain of PKB changes the conformation, thus permitting phosphorylation and activation of PKB. Deletion of the PH domain could potentially mimic the effect of phospholipid binding and thereby also relieve the constraint on PKB phosphorylation. Therefore, the increased basal activity of the ΔPH mutant could be due to an increase in its level of phosphorylation in nonstimulated cells. To test this, we determined whether the kinase activity of ΔPH-PKB could be prevented by dephosphorylation. We treated PKB immunoprecipitates from overexpressing cells with calf intestinal phosphatase prior to the kinase reaction to dephosphorylate the PKB constructs. To ensure that the phosphatase was indeed having an effect on the phosphorylation of PKB and not inhibiting the subsequent kinase assay, we also treated the constitutively active PKB mutant with calf intestinal phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the insulin-stimulated kinase activation of both the wild-type and ΔPH forms of PKB was abolished by treating the immunoprecipitates with calf intestinal phosphatase. Phosphatase treatment had no effect on constitutively active PKB, indicating that the phosphatase was most likely affecting the phosphorylation state of wild-type PKB and ΔPH-PKB. In addition, the basal activity of ΔPH-PKB was reduced after treatment with phosphatase. These results indicate that the increase in the kinase activity in nonstimulated cells is due to an increased level of phosphorylation of ΔPH-PKB. To further verify this hypothesis, we mutated the residues that are phosphorylated after insulin stimulation to alanines (T308A and S473A), thereby preventing their phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B). These mutations completely inhibited the activation of PKB by insulin. In addition, the ΔPH-T308A,S473A mutant exhibited a reduction in the basal kinase activity. This substantiates the findings from the phosphatase experiments showing that the increase in the basal activity of the ΔPH mutant is due to an increase in the level of phosphorylation. It has been proposed that th"

To elucidate the function of the yeast cytosolic hsp70 Ssa1p in vivo, we characterized aSaccharomyces cerevisiae ssa1 temperature-sensitive mutant (ssa1-134). After shifting to the restrictive temperature (37 °C), ssa1-134 mutant cells showed abnormal distribution of nuclei and accumulated as large-budded cells with a 2n DNA content. We observed more prominent mutant phenotypes using nocodazole-synchronized cells: when cells were incubated at the restrictive temperature following nocodazole treatment, viability was rapidly lost and abnormal arrays of bent microtubules were formed. Chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that the interaction of mutant Ssa1p with Ydj1p (cytosolic DnaJhomologue in yeast) was much weaker compared with wild-type Ssa1p. These results suggest that Ssa1p and Ydj1p chaperone activities play important roles in the regulation of microtubule formation in M phase. In support of this idea, a ydj1 null mutant at the restrictive temperature was found to exhibit more prominent phenotypes than ssa1-134. Furthermore, both ssa1-134 and ydj1 null mutant cells exhibited greater sensitivity to anti-microtubule drugs. Finally, the observation that SSA1and YDJ1 interact genetically with a γ-tubulin,TUB4, supports the idea that they play a role in the regulation of microtubule formation.

The hsp701 family of molecular chaperones is highly conserved from bacteria to mammals. Although initially identified as the proteins which are rapidly induced under stress conditions, they are now known to play essential roles in diverse cellular functions under normal conditions as well, including: 1) assisting the folding of newly synthesized proteins; 2) facilitating protein translocation across organelle membranes at the both sides of membranes; 3) promoting assembly or disassembly of oligomeric proteins; and 4) facilitating protein degradation of malfolded or denatured proteins. Hsp70 is known to function by transiently binding the hydrophobic peptide of unfolded or newly synthesized proteins and prevent misfolding by masking their hydrophobic regions. These interactions are assisted by the action of Escherichia coli DnaJ or its eukaryotic DnaJ homologue hsp40 (1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 12 homologues of the hsp70 family have been isolated and characterized so far (2Craig E.A. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 2.

They are classified into at least five subfamilies based on their structural and functional similarities and cellular localization. The SSAsubfamily exhibits the highest homology to mammalian hsp70, and is an essential group of proteins predominantly localized in the cytosol. This subfamily consists of four functionally redundant members (SSA1 to SSA4), each of which can substitute for the others (7Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The effect of various combinations of SSAsubfamily null alleles on cell growth have been extensively studied by Dr. Craig's group (7Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Disruption of the SSA1 and SSA2 genes rendered cells temperature-sensitive for growth at 35 °C or higher, while the additional disruption of theSSA4 gene produced cells which were not viable at any temperature (7Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This result shows that expression of SSA3alone under the control of its own promoter is insufficient to support viability. Experiments in which Ssap expression could be controlled by the GAL1 promoter revealed that Ssa proteins are involved in the translocation of a few proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in vivo (8Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1988; 332: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Further analysis using a temperature-sensitive ssa1 mutant produced similar results (9Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, as previously pointed out (10Nelson R.J. Heschl M.F. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1992; 131: 277-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Craig E.A. Baxter B.K. Becker J. Halladay J. Ziegelhoffer T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 31-52Google Scholar), Ssa1p may be involved in one or more essential functions in addition to protein translocation for the following reasons. First, the translocation defect of thessa1 mutant has been observed to affect only three out of nine proteins examined, α-factor, proteinase A, and mitochondrial β-subunit of F1-ATPase (F1β), and this translocation defect was partial (9Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Second, an extragenic suppressor of the temperature-sensitive ssa1 ssa2 strain,exa2-1, suppressed temperature sensitivity but did not suppress the defect in protein translocation (10Nelson R.J. Heschl M.F. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1992; 131: 277-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the essential role of Ssa proteins (Ssap) may involve more than its translocation function. Recently there is a growing body of evidence suggesting an intimate relationship between molecular chaperones and the cytoskeleton (12Liang P. MacRae T.H. J.

In this paper, we found that some Ts− ssa1mutant cells are defective in microtubular function and form aberrant microtubular structures at the restrictive temperature. Furthermore, mutant Ssa1p was shown to associate poorly with co-chaperone Ydj1p. We discuss a possible role of this putative Ssa1p·Ydj1p complex in the assembly/disassembly of microtubules.

A tub4-1 strain (Strain ESM208) carrying pRS314(TRP1) was crossed to HFSA/316P-SSA and sporulated. A tetrad was isolated with the genotypessa1::HIS3 ssa2::LEU2 ssa4::LYS2 tub4-1 and carrying the SSA1 gene on the single-copy plasmid (316P-SSA1(URA3)) (using auxotroph, red color, temperature sensitivity of tub4-1 allele, and 5-FOA sensitivity as markers). Strains MO203 (tub2-401), MO204 (tub2-402), and MO205 (tub2-403) were crossed to strain HFSA/316P-SSA and sporulated to obtain strains MO207, MO208, and MO209, respectively.

Then the SphI site was converted to a XhoI site by insertion of aXhoI linker. The resulting BamHI-XhoI DNA fragment was randomly mutagenized by PCR according to a previously described procedure (41Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods and Applications 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 28-33Google Scholar). The PCR reaction consisted of 20 fmol of template DNA, 1 μm primers (sequences: 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′ and 5′- GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTG-3′), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.01% gelatin, 7.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmMnCl2, 0.2 mm dATP, 0.2 mm dGTP, 1.0 mm dCTP, 1.0 mm dTTP, and 5 units of Taq polymerase and was performed with an automatic Thermal Cycler for 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min). The PCR product fragments were cut at BamHI and XhoI restriction sites and inserted into theBamHI-SalI site of the pGAP-SSA1 plasmid (42Bitter G.A. Egan K.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) to generate a plasmid library containing pGAP-SSA1M(TRP1), which carries a temperature-sensitive allele of the ssa1gene. This construct placed the PCR-mutagenized SSA1 genes under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. This library was introduced into the yeast strain HFSA-11 which carries disruptions of the chromosomal SSA1, SSA2, and SSA4 genes and is complemented by a single copy plasmid, pGAL-SSA1(URA3) expressing wild-type SSA1 from the GAL1 promoter. Trp+ transformants were obtained on medium. Trp+ Ura+ transformants were selected on media containing galactose and transferred to media containing glucose, which represses expression of pGAL-SSA1(URA3) and rendered cells dependent on mutagenized pGAP-SSA1M(TRP1) for growth. Transformants which grew on glucose at the permissive temperature (23 °C), but not at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) were chosen for further analysis. Plasmid DNA was recovered and reintroduced into strain HFSA-11. Transformants were subsequently replica plated onto 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) plates to obtain Trp+ Ura− strains, and the temperature-sensitive phenotype conferred by the plasmid was re-tested and confirmed. Plasmid DNA from one transformant, designated HFSA/A34, was recovered and the sequence of the ssa1 allele,ssa1-134, was determined. The following amino acid substitutions were found: Q254P, R339G, A633V, stop codon 643K + PIGAAIDNNENVF. A wild-type control strain, designated strain HFSA/AW, was derived by transforming the starting strain, HFSA-11 with the non-mutagenized pGAP-SSA1 plasmid. Radiolabeling of yeast cells and immunoprecipitaion of radiolabeled cell extracts were carried out essentially as described (43Rothblatt J.A. Deshaies R.J. Sanders S.L. Daum G. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2641-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were incubated for 3 h at 23 or 37 °C and then radiolabeled with EXPRESS [35S]Protein labeling mixture (DuPont) (400 μCi/OD600 cells) for 20 min. Extracts were prepared by resuspending cells in 200 μl of lysis buffer (100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by addition of glass beads, and vortexing four times, 30 s each. After addition of DSP, a cross-linking agent, lysates were incubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of 10 mm ATP, and diluted with 1 volume of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) and 4 volume of immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1.25% Triton X-100, 190 mm NaCl, 6 mmEDTA). Background binding was reduced by preincubation with preimmune rabbit antisera and Protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. The supernatant fraction was transferred to fresh siliconized tubes and incubated with 2 μl of rabbit anti-Ssa1p polyclonal antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After incubating the sample with Protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h, beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed three times with IP buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). Finally, the immunoprecipitates were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Yeast cells were cultured to log-phase in YPD medium. Yeast cells were washed once with sterile H2O and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), followed by glass beads lysis (44Oka M. Kimata Y. Mori K. Kohno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was performed with 0.5 mm DSP for 30 min at 30 °C. Yeast lysates were diluted with equal volume of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole) and incubated with pre-equilibrated nickel-charged resin for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 10 s. The supernatant fractions were used as the “unbound fraction.” After washing nickel-charged resin three times with binding buffer, resin-bound protein complexes were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole), concentrated with Centriprep-10 (Amicon, Inc), and used as the “bound fraction.” Both fractions were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunblotting analysis (44Oka M. Kimata Y. Mori K. Kohno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Ssa1p polyclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution) and rabbit anti-Ydj1p polyclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution) were used as primary antibodies in the respective experiments. For microtubule staining, cells were fixed by addition of formaldehyde directly to the culture to a final concentration of 3.7% and incubation at room temperature for 2 h. Fixed cells were washed with potassium phosphate buffer (0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 6.5) and converted into spheroplasts by incubation with 50 μg/ml zymolyase-100T (Seikagaku Corp. Tokyo, Japan) in 1.2 m sorbitol, 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol at 30 °C for between 15 and 40 min. Immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described (45Kilmartin J.V. Adams A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The rat monoclonal anti-yeast α-tubulin antibody, YOL1/34 (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corporation, NY), was used as the primary antibody and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG antiserum (Cappel Research Products, ICN, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was used as the secondary antibody. DNA was stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 3 min at room temperature before mounting. Preparations were viewed in a Zeiss Axiophoto fluorescence microscope. DNA sequences of the ssa1 alleles cloned into pGAP-SSA1M were determined by the dideoxy nucleotide triphosphate termination method using an automated procedure involving differential fluorescent labeling. All sequencing reactions and electrophoresis of the sequencing gels were performed according to the ABI manual for automated sequencing on a 373A DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Japan Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). To study the role of S. cerevisiae Ssa1p, we generated a temperature-sensitive allele of ssa1. We used a strain HFSA-11 as a parental strain, which is disrupted for the chromosomal SSA1, SSA2, and SSA4 genes and is rescued by the expression of pGAL-SSA1, a single copy vector which utilizes the galactose-inducible and glucose-repressibleGAL1 promoter for conditional expression of wild-typeSSA1 gene. To isolate temperature-sensitive ssa1alleles, this strain was transformed with another single copy plasmid carrying a PCR-mutagenized SSA1 gene under the transcriptional control of the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. Transformants were screened for growth on glucose-based media at 23 and 37 °C, conditions under which the wild-type SSA1 gene was not expressed. After counter selecting for pGAL-SSA1(URA) on 5-FOA plates and several precise experiments as described under “Materials and Methods,” we obtained some temperature-sensitive ssa1 strains designated as HFSA/AM. Each strain of HFSA/AM carries a single copy plasmid, pGAP-SSA1M, which expresses a temperature-sensitive ssa1gene, whereas the control strain designated as HFSA/AW carries pGAP-SSA1 which expresses an unmutagenized SSA1 gene. Microscopic and flow cytometric analyses showed that somessa1 mutants accumulate as large-budded cells containing 2n DNA content at the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C (data not shown). We chose ssa1-134 cells (strain HFSA/A34) for further analysis because it exhibited the most prominent phenotype compared with the wild-type SSA1 control cells (strain HFSA/AW), which did not show any significant changes in bud morphologies following the temperature shift (Fig. 1, A and B). To visualize nuclei we stained cells with DAPI (Fig. 1 C). In the large-budded wild-type SSA1 cells, nuclei were located close to the bud neck and relocated accordingly, one each to the mother and daughter cells, soon after nuclear division. However,ssa1–134 mutant cells exhibited a different cell morphology after shift to 37 °C: both nuclei migrated to the mother cell, but none to the daughter cell (Fig. 1 C, lane e). This led us to conclude that ssa1-134 cells may be defective in nuclear migration. Furthermore, in a large portion of ssa1-134 cells a single nucleus was observed to be localized randomly within the mother cell (Fig. 1 C, lane d). In these cells, the nuclei did not migrate to the bud-neck. Fewer SSA1 cells were observed with this morphology than ssa1-134 cells. The percentage of cells with both nuclei correctly distributed and a single nucleus properly located at the bud-neck was dramatically lower in ssa1-134 cells compared with SSA1 cells (Fig. 1 C, lanes b and c). These results imply that Ssa1p plays an important role in the orientation and migration of nuclei during mitosis. Abnormal nuclear migration is a phenotype frequently observed in mutants of tubulin or its functionally related proteins, such as motor proteins or chaperonins (20Ursic D. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell.

Besides the binding to β- or γ-catenin, it is unknown, however, which interaction is critical for the function of cadherins. By expressing a series of E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric molecules on leukemia cells (K562), we have identified the region of α-catenin that confers aggregation inducing activity to nonfunctional tail-less E-cadherin. The region has been mapped to the carboxyl-terminal 295 amino acids of α-catenin. Consistent with this result, expression in α-catenin-deficient cells (DLD-1/Δα) of a mutant α-catenin molecule consisting of the amino-terminal β-/γ-catenin-binding site and the carboxyl-terminal cell adhesion region identified in the above experiments induced E-cadherin-mediated cell aggregation and compaction.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5770-5774PubMed Google Scholar). PC9 cells that lack α-catenin because of deletion of a part of the α-catenin gene exhibit cadherin-dependent adhesion upon introduction of α-catenin, identifying the latter as an indispensable molecule for the cadherin adhesion complex to be functional (12Hirano S. Kimoto N. Shimoyama Y. Hirohashi S. Takeichi M. Cell. 1992; 70: 293-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In addition, reintroduction of α-catenin into the same cell line has been shown to induce a polarized phenotype typical of epithelial cells and to alter the growth rate (13Watabe M. Nagafuchi A.

In such junctions, vinculin is thought to be one of a number of interacting proteins which link the cytoplasmic face of adhesion receptors of the cadherin or integrin family to the actin cytoskeleton.

Jockusch B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that vinculin associates with E-cadherin complexes via β-catenin (29Hazan R.B. Kang L. Roe S. Borgen P.I. Rimm D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32448-32453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). While the discovery and characterization of catenins provided a major insight into the molecular interactions of cadherins, it is possible that the actual junctional complexes contain a multitude of additional proteins. To examine the homophilic adhesive properties of cadherins, we recently developed a model system which involves the transfection of K562 leukemia cells with the cDNA of interest and analysis of the adhesive properties of the resulting transfectants (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The expression of functional cadherin changes non-adhesive cells into cells that grow as aggregates. In those studies we transfected cells with an expression vector encoding an E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric molecule consisting of (a) the entire extracellular and transmembrane domains of E-cadherin as well as the first 80 amino acids of its cytoplasmic domain, excluding the region shown to associate with β- or γ-catenin (6Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), and (b) amino acids 301–906 of α-catenin, which include the domains necessary for association with α-actinin and actin (15Nieset J.E.

The cell clones expressing the chimeric protein on their surface were found to form aggregates in an E-cadherin-dependent manner. These findings provided us with an opportunity to identify the minimum region of α-catenin, besides the β-/γ-catenin-binding site, required for its function in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. In this study we present evidence that the carboxyl-terminal region of α-catenin (residues 612–906) is enough to trigger the adhesive activity of E-cadherin provided it is covalently linked to E-cadherin or associated with the E-cadherin adhesion complex through its interaction with β-/γ-catenin via its amino-terminal β-/γ-catenin-binding site. The expression vector for the wild-type E-cadherin or an E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric protein (EαMC)1 was as described previously (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding an E-cadherin mutant protein, EΔC71 (5Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar), was cloned into the same expression vector, pCAGGS neo (31Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. K. Yamamura, Kumamoto University). A full-length cDNA clone for human α-catenin was described previously (32Ozawa M. Terada H. Pedraza C. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1077-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the expression of E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric proteins, the ClaI-ClaI fragment of E-cadherin cDNA that encodes the 71 amino acids including the catenin-binding domain of E-cadherin was replaced with the following cDNA fragments encoding various regions of α-catenin generated using convenient restriction enzyme sites within the cDNA clones or by means of the polymerase chain reaction using Pwo DNA polymerase (Boehringer) (Fig. 1, A and C). The combinations of restriction enzymes used were: BglII and StuI (for construction of EαN), Eco47III and ClaI (EαM), ClaI and ClaI (EαC), ClaI and PmaCI (EαCΔC1), ClaI and PstI (EαCΔC4), ClaI and HindIII (EαCΔC5),SmaI and EcoRV (EαCΔN2), BalI and EcoRV (EαCΔN3), BalI and EcoRV (EαCΔN4), and BamHI and BamHI (EαCΔN5). For the polymerase chain reaction, three combinations of sense and antisense primers (5′-CCCATCGATACCCCTGAGGAGTTG and 5′-CCCATCGATTAGATGCTGTCCATAGC) (for construction of EαCΔN1), (5′-GAGTTTATCGATGCTTCCCGC and 5′-CCCATCGATTAACCCTGTGACTTTTG) (EαCΔC2), and (5′-GAGTTTATCGATGCTTCCCGC and 5′-CCCATCGATTACCCAGAGACAACAAG) (EαCΔC3), containing aClaI recognition sequence at the 5′-end were used. Expression vectors for E-cadherin-vinculin chimeric molecules were constructed in the same way using cDNA for chicken vinculin (25Price G.L. Jones P. Davison M.D. Patel B. Bendori R. Geiger B. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. B. Geiger, The Weizmann Institute of Science). The restriction enzymes used were: ClaI and ClaI (for construction of EVC1), and Sau3AI and ClaI (EVC2). In the latter case, the reading frame was adjusted using an oligonucleotide, ATCGAT. To construct the expression vector for an E-cadherin chimera with the full-length vinculin, a ClaI recognition sequence was introduced into the vinculin cDNA at positions −6 to −1 of the initiation codon. In the case of the carboxyl-terminal truncation, the termination codon was introduced using either oligonucleotide ATCGGCTACCCCTACGACGTCCCCGACTACGCCGGCGTCTAGATCAAGCTTATCG (for construction of EαN), ATATCGGCTACCCCTACGACGTCCCCGACTACGCCGGCGTCTAGATCAAGCTTATCG (EαM), GCTTAATTAATTAAGC (EαCΔC1 and EαCΔC4), or GTGA (EαCΔC5). The wild-type and mutant α-catenin polypeptides were expressed using the same expression vector. cDNA encoding a mutant α-catenin polypeptide with a deletion in the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the amino-terminal region and the entire middle portion (αΔN′M) was constructed by deleting a 1231-base pairBalI-ClaI fragment. cDNA encoding another mutant α-catenin polypeptide with a further deletion in the carboxyl-terminal region (αΔN′M-2) was constructed by replacing a 1460-base pair BalI-BalI fragment with an oligonucleotide, GGGGG. Human leukemia K562 cells (kindly provided by Dr. K. Sekiguchi, Research Institute, Osaka Medical Center for Maternal and Child Health) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. K562 cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin (EK cells) or an E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric protein (EαMCK cells) were as described previously (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). K562 cells (5 × 106) were transfected with the expression vectors (10 μg) by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser set at 280 V and 960 microfarads. Human colon cancer DLD-1/Δα cells, DLD-1 cells deficient in α-catenin expression, were kindly provided by Dr. S. T. Suzuki (Institute for Developmental Research, Aichi Human Service Center), and were grown as described above. Transfection of DLD-1/Δα cells with the expression vectors was carried out by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (5Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against α-, β-, and γ-catenin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. DECMA-1, a monoclonal antibody to E-cadherin (33Vestweber D. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1985; 13: 3393-3398Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. R. Kemler (Max-Planck-Institut für Immunbiologie). HECD-1, a monoclonal antibody to human E-cadherin, was purchased from Takara Shuzou Co. For immunoblot analysis, cells (1 × 105) were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli SDS gel sample buffer, run on 8% polyacrylamide gels, and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with monoclonal antibodies and finally peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After washing with the buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20, the protein bands were visualized with an ECL detection kit (Amersham). To detect E-cadherin chimeric molecules in the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells, cells (1 × 106) were lysed in 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation, the precipitates were boiled for 5 min in the SDS gel sample buffer and then subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The E-cadherin-catenin complex was collected using HECD-1 anti-E-cadherin monoclonal antibodies which had been preabsorbed to protein G-Sepharose 4B (Sigma). The cell aggregation assay was performed as described previously (6Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) except that the K562 cell transfectants were passed through Pasteur pipettes several times to obtain single cells. The transfected DLD-1/Δα cells were dissociated with 0.01% trypsin in HEPES-buffered saline containing 2 mmCaCl2. After the incubation, the cells were fixed by the addition of an equal volume of 6% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (5Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar) using DECMA-1 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rat IgG. To be fully functional in cell-cell adhesion, E-cadherin is believed to become associated with catenins through its carboxyl-terminal region (Fig. 1 A). Either β-catenin or γ-catenin associates directly with the cadherin; α-catenin binds to β-catenin/γ-catenin. A carboxyl terminus-truncated cadherin (EΔC71) cannot associate with catenins and therefore is nonfunctional, i.e. cells expressing this protein cannot form aggregates. By covalently linking the amino-terminal half or the carboxyl-terminal half of the α-catenin polypeptide to the nonfunctional cadherin, it has been shown that the carboxyl-terminal half of α-catenin has the ability to restore the adhesive activity of nonfunctional E-cadherin (34Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). On expressing, in a leukemia cell line (K562), a similar E-cadherin chimeric molecule containing the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of α-catenin, we observed that, like E-cadherin expressing K562 cells, cells expressing this chimeric E-cadherin not only formed aggregates but also showed compaction (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To identify the region of α-catenin that confers aggregation and compaction inducing activities to the nonfunctional tail-less E-cadherin, I constructed a series of cDNA encoding E-cadherin chimeric molecules containing various regions of α-catenin (Fig. 1 C), and expressed them on K562 cells. K562 cells grow as non-adhesive single cells, with no endogenous cadherin. They are more advantageous than other types of cells, such as L cells, because the aggregates formed by K562 cells expressing E-cadherin can be dissociated into single cells by passage several times through Pasteur pipettes without the use of trypsinization in the presence of Ca2+. Cells stably expressing these molecules were selected and examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with an anti-E-cadherin antibody, DECMA-1 (Fig. 2 A). The E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric molecules migrated as polypeptides of the sizes expected from their constructs. The chimeric protein levels did not differ by more than 20% among the K562 cell lines expressing the different E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric molecules except for EαNK cells and EαMK cells; in these cells the protein levels decreased during the culture. The expression of these two chimeric proteins seemed to be unstable because two types of cells, one positive and the other negative for DECMA-1 staining, were present even after recloning of the cells. To quantitatively compare the cell adhesion activities of different E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric molecules, and that of wild-type E-cadherin, cells expressing the chimeric proteins together with cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin (EK cells) or nonfunctional E-cadherin (EΔC71K cells) were subjected to cell aggregation assaying (Fig. 3). As described previously (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), EK cells expressing the intact form of E-cadherin aggregated in an E-cadherin-dependent manner; i.e. it was inhibited by the presence of the E-cadherin antibody, DECMA-1. EΔC71K cells expressing nonfunctional E-cadherin did not aggregate as extensively as EK cells. Among the cells expressing different E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric proteins, cells expressing the chimeric molecules, EαMC (EαMCK cells) and EαC (EαCK cells), were able to aggregate to a similar extent to EK cells (Fig. 3), and showed a morphological change, so-called compaction (data not shown). EαCΔC1K cells and EαCΔN1K cells aggregated, however, reproducibly to a lower extent as compared with EαMCK cells and EαCK cells. In the case of EαCΔC1K cells, the size of the aggregates formed was significantly smaller (less than half size in diameter) than in the cases of the other cells, such as EαMCK and EαCK cells (data not shown). Cells transfected with the other constructs, EαNK cells, EαMK cells, EαCΔC2K cells, EαCΔC3K cells, EαCΔC4K cells, EαCΔC5K cells, EαCΔN2K cells, EαCΔN3K cells, EαCΔN4K cells, and EαCΔN5K cells, did not aggregate significantly under the same conditions (Fig. 3). As mentioned above, cultures of EαNK or EαMK cells contained two populations of cells, one strongly positive and the other negative as to the expression of E-cadherin chimeras. Despite the strong expression of the E-cadherin chimeras on their surface, these cells did not aggregate under the conditions used. Therefore, it seemed that the region of α-catenin that confers aggregation and compaction inducing activities to nonfunctional tail-less E-cadherin is localized to residues 612–906. Like the aggregation of EK cells, the aggregation of K562 cells expressing the different E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric molecules was inhibited in the presence of the E-cadherin antibody (Fig. 3). The aggregation of these cells is also Ca2+-dependent, since no aggregation was observed in the presence of 5 mm EGTA (data not shown). The detergent insolubility of cadherin has been shown to be an indication of complex association with the actin cytoskeleton (6Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 35Hirano S. Nose A. Hatta K. Kawakami A. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2501-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This association is a prerequisite for the cell adhesive activity of cadherins (4Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 6Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 12Hirano S. Kimoto N. Shimoyama Y. Hirohashi S. Takeichi M. Cell. 1992; 70: 293-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the solubility of the E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric molecules in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Approximately 90% of the wild-type E-cadherin expressed in K562 cells was solubilized in the buffer (data not shown). In EK cells, however, a fraction (∼10%) of E-cadherin was detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction, whereas there was almost no mutant tail-less E-cadherin (EΔC71) (Fig. 2 B). A similar amount (approximately 10%) of E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric molecules containing the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of α-catenin (EαMC) was also detected in the insoluble fraction. Of the E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric molecules containing either the amino-terminal domain (EαN), middle part (EαM), or carboxyl-terminal domain (EαC) of α-catenin, only EαC was detected in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 2B). The progressive deletions from the carboxyl terminus of the carboxyl-terminal domain significantly reduced the amounts of the chimeric proteins recovered in the insoluble fraction (EαCΔC1 and EαCΔC2), and further deletions completely prevented the interaction with the actin cytoskeleton (EαCΔC3, EαCΔC4, and EαCΔC5). The three deletions from the amino-terminal side of the carboxyl-terminal domain did not affect the interaction with the actin cytoskeleton (EαCΔN1, EαCΔN2, and EαCΔN3), but further deletions resulted in a lack of association with the actin cytoskeleton (EαCΔN4 and EαCΔN5). From these results it seemed that the region of the α-catenin polypeptide required for the interaction with the actin cytoskeleton resides in residues 689–906. This region is much smaller than the region that confers aggregation and compaction inducing activities to nonfunctional tail-less E-cadherin (residues 612–906), but it corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal region of α-catenin showing the highest degree of homology with vinculin (Fig. 1 B). These results suggested that the anchorage to the actin cytoskeleton is not enough to rescue the nonfunctional E-cadherin and that the carboxyl-terminal region of α-catenin plays an additional role other than binding to the actin cytoskeleton. The carboxyl-terminal region of α-catenin having the ability to rescue nonfunctional cadherin as an adhesion molecule when covalently attached to the nonfunctional E-cadherin contains the region showing the highest degree (34%) of homology with vinculin (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, we next examined whether or not an analogous region of vinculin can rescue the nonfunctional E-cadherin through covalently linking to the latter protein. Two cDNAs encoding two E-cadherin-vinculin chimeric molecules were constructed (Fig. 1 D). These constructs contained the carboxyl-terminal 350 (amino acid residues 717–1066) or 257 (residues 810–1066) amino acids of vinculin, respectively, thus both included the actin-binding domain (27Menkel A.R. Kroemker M. Bubeck P. Ronsiek M. Nikolai G. Jockusch B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing the respective chimera proteins (EVC1K cells and EVC2K cells) were isolated and examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting with DECMA-1 (Fig. 2 A). The E-cadherin-vinculin chimeric molecules (EVC1 and EVC2) migrated as polypeptides of the sizes expected from their constructs. As expected from their known ability to bind to actin filaments, ∼10% of these chimeric polypeptides were recovered in the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 2 B). The cells expressing these chimeras did not, however, aggregate to the same extent as EK cells or EαCK cells did under the conditions used (Fig. 3). Furthermore, an E-cadherin chimera with the full-length vinculin (EV) expressed on K562 cells (Fig. 2 A) could not support E-cadherin-mediated adhesion (Fig. 3), although ∼50% of the chimera was partitioned in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the results seemed to support the idea that the carboxyl-terminal region of α-catenin plays an additional role other than binding to the actin cytoskeleton. In a normal situation, α-catenin becomes associated with the cadherin-adhesion complex through binding to β-catenin or γ-catenin in the complex. Its amino-terminal binding site for β-catenin or γ-catenin is responsible for the binding. It is therefore of importance to determine whether or not the α-catenin region identified in the above experiments can activate the E-cadherin adhesion complex when connected to either β-catenin or γ-catenin via its own binding site. For this, we constructed a cDNA encoding a mutant α-catenin polypeptide consisting of the amino-terminal β-/γ-catenin-binding site and the carboxyl-terminal 295 amino acids (αΔN′M) by deleting the sequence encoding the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the amino-terminal region and the entire middle part (amino acids 203–611) (Fig. 4 A). As a control, another truncated α-catenin (αΔN′M-2) that lacks amino acids 203–688 was also constructed. A human cell line (DLD1/Δα cells) that did not express endogenous α-catenin was transfected with the expression vector containing cDNA for either wild-type α-catenin or the mutant α-catenin polypeptides, αΔ1/3NM or αΔ1/3NM-2, or the control neo vector. Cells expressing these proteins were cloned and examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with an anti-α-catenin monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4 B). The mutant proteins migrated as a polypeptide of 54 and 46 kDa, respectively, the expected molecular mass of the proteins. Association of the mutant α-catenin proteins with the E-cadherin adhesion complex was studied by means of co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and E-cadherin was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an E-cadherin antibody, HECD-1. A protein migrating to positions corresponding to 88 kDa was coprecipitated with E-cadherin (120 kDa) in the case of DLD1/Δα cells transfected with the control vector (nD cells) (Fig. 4 C). The coprecipitated protein was identified as β-catenin by subjecting the immunoprecipitates to immunoblot analysis with β-catenin antibodies (data not shown). In the case of DLD1/Δα cells expressing wild-type α-catenin (αD cells), a protein of 102 kDa was also coprecipitated in addition to these proteins. The same analysis of DLD1/Δα cells expressing mutant α-catenin polypeptides, i.e. αΔN′M or αΔN′M-2 (αΔN′MD cells or αΔN′M-2D cells), revealed that polypeptides of 54 or 46 kDa, respectively, which correspond to the size of the mutant α-catenin proteins, were coprecipitated together with E-cadherin and β-catenin (Fig. 4 C). These protein bands were identified as the wild-type and mutant α-catenin polypeptides by immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with the α-catenin antibody (data not shown). These cells were dissociated with 0.01% trypsin in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, and then subjected to the aggregation assay (Fig. 5 A). Although DLD1/Δα cells expressing αΔN′MD-2 protein (αΔN′M-2D cells) and DLD1/Δα cells transfected with the control neo vector (nD cells) as well as parental DLD1/Δα cells (not shown) showed a low degree of aggregation, cells expressing either wild-type α-catenin (αD cells) or αΔN′M protein (αΔN′MD cells) showed a significantly enhanced level of aggregation (Fig. 5 A). The cadherin-mediated cell aggregation is accompanied by a morphological change, so-called compaction. The aggregates of αD cells and αΔN′MD cells showed extensive compaction (Fig. 5 B), whereas the aggregates of αΔN′M-2D cells and nD cells did not show such a morphological change, and each cell in the aggregates was easily distinguishable (Fig. 5 B). To be fully functional in cell-cell adhesion, the cadherin molecule is believed to become associated with the actin cytoskeleton via cytoplasmic catenins. Through binding to β- or γ-catenin, α-catenin becomes associated with the cadherin adhesion complex. Although α-catenin itself is an actin-binding protein (19Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), it has been shown that α-catenin interacts with at least two actin-binding proteins, i.e. α-actinin (15Nieset J.E. Redfield A.R. Jin F. Knudsen K.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ZO-1 (20Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), both proteins being co-precipitated with and colocalized with E-cadherin (20Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 36Knudsen K.A. Soler A.P. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Because the amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal domain of α-catenin is similar to that of the self-association domain of vinculin, it has been suggested that vinculin may interact with α-catenin at adhesion sites (22Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Cell. 1991; 65: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the molecular linkage between cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton may include multiple actin-binding proteins. By expressing a series of E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric molecules on leukemia cells (K562) that have no endogenous cadherin, we have identified the region of α-catenin that confers aggregation and compaction-inducing activities to nonfunctional tail-less E-cadherin. The region has been mapped to the carboxyl-terminal 295 amino acids (amino acids 612–906) of α-catenin. Consistent with this result, expression in α-catenin-deficient cells (DLD1/Δα) of a mutant α-catenin molecule consisting of the amino-terminal β-/γ-catenin-binding site and the carboxyl-terminal cell adhesion region identified in the above experiments induced E-cadherin-mediated cell aggregation and compaction. This region seems to contain two functional domains, a carboxyl-terminal one (amino acid residues 689–906) involved in the association with the actin cytoskeleton, and an amino-terminal one (amino acid residues 612–688) with an unknown function. Both of the domains are required for the cell adhesion activity. Although carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues 689–906 of α-catenin seem to be sufficient to anchor the chimeric molecule to the actin cytoskeleton, they were not able to restore the adhesive activity to nonfunctional tail-less E-cadherin. Together with the observation that cells expressing the E-cadherin chimeric molecules covalently linked with the carboxyl-terminal region of vinculin, which contains the actin-binding site of vinculin, do not aggregate to the same extent as cells expressing the E-cadherin chimeric molecule with the carboxyl-terminal region of α-catenin, these results seem to suggest that the simple linkage of the cadherin molecules to the actin cytoskeleton is not enough to activate the nonfunctional E-cadherin, and that the carboxyl-terminal region of α-catenin could play a role besides actin binding. The role of the region including amino acid residues 612–688 of α-catenin remains to be determined in future experiments. This region does not, however, correspond to the α-actinin-binding site. Amino acid residues 325–394 of α-catenin have been shown to be sufficient for the interaction with α-actinin (15Nieset J.E. Redfield A.R. Jin F. Knudsen K.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the interaction of α-catenin with α-actinin is not essential for the cadherin-mediated cell adhesion in the cells used in the present study. Although the binding site on α-catenin for ZO-1 has not been identified, ZO-1 seems not to be expressed in K562 cells (37Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Therefore, the E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion analyzed in the present study takes place in the absence of ZO-1. Thus, it is less likely that this region is the site for ZO-1-binding. Recently, gene trap screening of mice revealed a fusion between the amino-terminal 632 amino acids of α-catenin and the β-geo reporter. Embryos homozygous for this mutant allele were shown to exhibit deficits in cell adhesion resulting in embryonic lethality (38Torres M. Stoykova A. Huber O. Chowdhury K. Bonaldo P. Mansouri A. Butz S. Kemler R. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Overexpression of an α-catenin mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal 230 amino acids in Xenopus embryos causes severe developmental defects that reflect impaired Ca2+-dependent blastomere adhesion (39Sehgal R.N.M. Gumbiner B.M. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These observations suggested the importance of the carboxyl-terminal region of α-catenin in cadherin-based cell adhesion. Although in these studies why the carboxyl-terminal deletion of α-catenin resulted in a deficiency of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion was not determined, our finding provides the molecular basis for these observations.

The expression of the mouse R1 and R2 genes is strictly correlated to S phase. Using promoter-reporter gene constructs, we have defined a region of the TATA-less mouse ribonucleotide reductase R1 gene promoter that correlates reporter gene expression to S phase. This is demonstrated in stably transformed cells both synchronized by serum starvation and separated by centrifugal elutriation, suggesting that the R1 gene expression during the cell cycle is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. The region contains four protein-binding DNA elements, β (nucleotides −189 to −167), α (−98 to −76), Inr (−4 to +16), and γ (+34 to +61), together regulating promoter activity. The nearly identical upstream elements, α and β, each form three DNA-protein complexes in gel shift assays. We have identified YY1 as a component in at least one of the complexes using supershift antibodies and a yeast one-hybrid screening of a mouse cDNA library using the α element as a target.

The enzyme ribonucleotide reductase is essential for de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. In this perspective, ribonucleotide reductase plays a central role in providing the precursors for DNA synthesis. Mammalian ribonucleotide reductase consists of two non-identical homodimeric subunits, proteins R1 and R2 (1Thelander L. Gräslund A. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 30. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 109-129Google Scholar). Protein R1 (large subunit) contains the active site and allosteric sites for regulating enzyme activity. Protein R2 (small subunit) carries a tyrosyl free radical essential for enzyme activity. In quiescent or differentiated cells, none of the two subunits can be detected. In proliferating cells, the expression of protein R2 is S phase specific, whereas protein R1 shows a constant level throughout the cell cycle (2Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Engström Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol.

However, both the R1 and R2 mRNA levels vary in parallel during the cell cycle with negligible levels during G0/G1 and maximal levels during S phase (5Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 6Hengstschläger M. Mudrak I. Wintersberger E. Wawra E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 1389-1394PubMed Google Scholar). The R1 and R2 promoters are also activated in resting cells upon UV irradiation leading to nucleotide excision repair (7Filatov D. Björklund S. Johansson E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23698-23704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Genomic clones covering the mouse R1 and R2 genes have been isolated (8Björklund S. Hjortsberg K.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2475-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The R2 promoter contains a TATA-box and a proximal element, called α, that contains an NF-Y binding CCAAT motif (10Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The R1 gene consists of 19 exons that covers 26 kb.1 In contrast to the R2 promoter, the R1 promoter is TATA-less. DNase I footprinting assays proximal to the transcription start revealed two protected regions, α (nt −98 to −76) and β (nt −189 to −167) (8Björklund S. Hjortsberg K. Johansson E. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11322-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These two regions are each 23 nt and identical except for one nucleotide. Three DNA-protein complexes, A, B, and C, are formed when oligonucleotides corresponding to the α or β footprints are used in gel shift assays. Complexes A and B are present at constant levels during the cell cycle, whereas complex C increases in S phase cells. A comparison between the human and mouse R1 promoters revealed four conserved regions (11Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These were α, β, an initiator element (Inr), and one downstream region, γ. The initiator element did not fully conform to the Inr consensus YYAN(T/A)YY (12Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), but a functional analysis showed that both the Inr and the γ regions were essential for cell cycle-regulated R1 promoter activity (11Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that TFII-I binds to the R1 Inr, whereas the transcription factors YY1 or USF did not recognize the Inr. A functional analysis of the R1 promoter using promoter-reporter gene constructs in stably transformed cells indicated that α and β were not essential for cell cycle-regulated transcription (11Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, these assays only allowed a qualitative analysis of R1 promoter activity. Furthermore, in these experiments the major increase in R1 promoter activity came about 4 h after cells entered S phase, indicating that we were lacking an important regulatory DNA element. We have now made new promoter-reporter gene constructs defining an R1 promoter region that faithfully regulates S phase expression of the reporter gene. Using a transient transfection assay for a quantitative analysis of R1 promoter activity, we demonstrate that α and β are important for R1 promoter strength. Finally, our data suggest that YY1 functions as an activator in the R1 promoter by binding to the α and β footprints. The luciferase reporter gene plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega) was opened withBglII and HindIII, and a new linker containing unique EcoRI and Esp3I sites was introduced upstream from the luciferase gene. Next, a 177-bp fragment from the mouse R1 5′-UTR (EcoRI-Esp3I) was introduced into the linker. This construct, pGL3R1 177, was then opened withSacI and EcoRI, and a 5.5-kbSacI-EcoRI R1 promoter fragment was inserted to complete the pGL3R1 5.7 construct (Fig. 1). Shorter constructs, pGL3R1 3.7 and pGL3R1 420 (Fig. 1), were made by digesting the pGL3R1 5.7 withSacI-BglII and EcoICRI-EcoRV, respectively, followed by filling in sticky ends with the Klenow fragment and religation. The constructs pGL3R1 420-Inr(−4/+6) and pGL3R1 420-γ(+33/+43) were made by digesting the pGL3R1 420 with EcoRI-XbaI and EcoRI-HindIII, respectively. The primer pairs, 5′-GACGGACGGAATTCCTTGATATCACTTGACGTTTCAACG-3′ and 5′-GTCTCCCGGGCTTTGCCCACACTC-3′, were used in a PCR reaction to introduce a 10-nt mutation in the Inr element. The resulting PCR product was cut with EcoRI-XbaI and ligated into the opened pGL3R1 420 construct. The primer pairs, 5′-ATTCGAATTCCGTCCGTCGCGTTGCTCTGCAACGAGATATCGGCGGGAGCGGGAA-3′ and 5′-CTTATGCAGTTGCTCTCCA-3′, were used in a PCR reaction to introduce a 10-nt mutation in the γ region. The resulting PCR product was cut with EcoRI-HindIII and ligated into the opened pGL3R1 420 construct. The pGL3R1 420-Inr(−4/+6)-γ(+33/+43) was created by subcloning the EcoRI-HindIII fragment from the pGL3R1 420 -γ(+33/+43) into the pGL3R1 420-Inr(−4/+6) construct, opened withEcoRI-HindIII. The pGL3R1 420-Inr(−4/+6) construct was digested with EcoRV and HindIII, and then the ends were filled in and religated, creating the pGL3R1 α/β construct. A series of constructs, pGL3R1 287 with or without mutations in the α footprint, were designed in the following way (Fig. 4 B). pGL3R1 177 was opened in XbaI and EcoRI. A region from XbaI nt −106 to nt +61 was amplified from pGL3R1 3.7 by a polymerase chain reaction using five different 5′ primers, each one starting 4 nt upstream from theXbaI site and containing the mutations shown in Fig. 4 B and 5′-CTCCTTCCCGCTCCCGCCACCCGTGACG-3′ at the 3′-end. The resulting fragment was digested with XbaI and EcoRI, purified on an agarose gel, and ligated into the opened pGL3R1 177 bp.Figure 4Transient transfection assays analyzing the function of the α footprint in exponentially growing cells. A, the firefly luciferase activity controlled by the R1 promoter was divided by the Renilla luciferase control plasmid activity to quantify the R1 promoter activity. The promoter activity of the mutant constructs was normalized against the wild-type promoter activity. The bars show the mean value (± standard deviation) from two independent experiments. B, the pGL3 287 construct is defined as the wild-type promoter, carrying the correct DNA sequence in the α footprint. The different mutations in the α footprint are listed below the wild-type sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The pGL3-control plasmid contains a firefly luciferase gene under the control of SV40 promoter and enhancer. This plasmid was used to construct a hybrid gene that express luciferase mRNA containing R1 mRNA in the 3′-UTR. This construct (pGL3 +49) was designed as follows. Two 49-mers were annealed (13Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), 5′-CTAGACAAACTTCTATAAGTCATTTTGAAATAAACATTTCTAAGTGATA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTATCACTTAGAAATGTTTATTTCAAAATGACTTATAGAAGTTTGT-3′. The overhangs were compatible with the opened XbaI site in the pGL3-control plasmid, and the 49-mer was subsequently ligated into the firefly luciferase 3′-UTR, upstream from the luciferase gene poly(A) signal. Balb/3T3 fibroblasts were cotransfected by electroporation as described previously (14Björklund S. Skogman E. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4953-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with R1 promoter-reporter gene constructs and a pSV2neo plasmid. Several independent clones of stable transformants were selected in the presence of Geneticin (G418) and assayed for luciferase activity, expressed as light units per microgram of protein (14Björklund S. Skogman E. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4953-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar). Cells were synchronized by serum starvation as described earlier (5Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). At least two independent clones were analyzed for each construct. Logarithmically growing cells were separated on the basis of different cell size by centrifugal elutriation using a Beckman JE-6B elutriation system (2Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A sample of each fraction was analyzed by flow cytometry to give cell cycle distribution and cell concentration. The remaining cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity, which in this experiment is given as light units per cell. To measure the promoter strength, Balb/3T3 cells were transiently cotransfected with R1 promoter-reporter gene constructs and a control plasmid, pRLSV40 (Promega), by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (16Kingston, R. E. (1990) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K., eds) Suppl. 14, pp. 9.1.1–9.1.9, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). A typical precipitate contained 2–3 μg of control plasmid, 2–8 μg of R1 promoter-reporter gene construct, and pUC18 to a total amount of 20 μg of DNA. This precipitate was incubated with 0.5 × 106 cells for 14 h. Then, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium was added. This medium contained 10% heat-inactivated horse serum when exponentially growing cells were harvested 24 h later and 0.6% fetal bovine serum when the cells were synchronized by serum starvation. After 48 h of starvation, medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added back, and the cells were harvested at different time points. One-half of the cells were used for flow cytometry analyses and the other half was used for enzyme assays. Firefly luciferase expressed by the pGL3R1 plasmids and Renilla luciferase expressed by the pRLSV40 plasmid were assayed by the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was then divided by Renilla luciferase activity to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency between plates. This value reflects the R1 promoter activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Balb/3T3 cells as described (17Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were composed as described (11Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the antibodies against YY1, SRF, DP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NF-YA, and NF-YB (kindly provided by Dr. Roberto Mantovani, Universita di Milano) were added last to the reaction mixture, followed by an incubation on ice for 1–2 h before the 15-min incubation at 30 °C. The following oligonucleotides annealed with a complementary oligonucleotide were used in the competition experiments: β footprint, 5′-TTGCCCACACCCAATATGGCGGC-3′; β (−YY1), 5′-TTGCCCACACCCttTtaccCGGC-3′; c-Myc −260 YY1 oligonucleotide (18Riggs K.J. Merrell K.T. Wilson G. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1765-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), 5′-GAAGAGAAAATGGTCGGGCG-3′. Oligonucleotides with the sequence shown in Fig. 4 B annealed with a complimentary oligonucleotide were used in gel shift experiments to determine how different mutations in the α footprint effect the protein-DNA interaction. The yeast one-hybrid system and a mouse T-cell lymphoma Matchmaker cDNA library were purchased from CLONTECH. The screening was essentially performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Five copies of the R1 α footprint were inserted into the polylinker of the three plasmids pHisi, pHisi-1, and placzi just upstream from the minimal promoter of the HIS3 and lacz genes. A dual reporter yeast strain (YMEJ2) was established by integrating pHisi-1 and placzi into the genome. YMEJ2 grew poorly on SD(−His)+15 mm3-aminotriazole and not at all on SD(−His)+45 mm3-aminotriazole agar plates. The Matchmaker cDNA library, expressing mouse proteins fused to the GAL4 activation domain, was transfected into YMEJ2, and the yeast was plated on SD(−His)+45 mm 3-aminotriazole agar plates. The expression plasmid was isolated from the positive yeast clones and transfected intoEscherichia coli, JM109. A portion of the mouse cDNA was sequenced in each plasmid and used to search Genbank with Blastsearch. Using the improved luciferase vector, pGL3, we made a plasmid containing 5.7 kb of the R1 promoter in front of the luciferase gene. This construct, pGL3R1 5.7, and two shorter versions, pGL3R1 3.7 and pGL3R1 420 (Fig. 1), were all regulated in the same way when independent clones of stably transformed cells were analyzed after serum starvation and readdition (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Now, the increase in luciferase activity showed a good correlation to the increase in S phase cells like the expression of R1 mRNA (5Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), indicating that the R1 gene is regulated mainly at the level of transcription. The pGL3 control plasmid, containing the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the SV40 promoter, did not show an S phase correlated expression (data not shown). The observed increase in R1 promoter activity as cells entered S phase could be due to a serum proliferation response and not represent a true cell cycle regulation. To exclude this possibility, we elutriated logarithmically growing stably transformed cells containing the pGLR1 420 construct (Fig. 3). The fractions enriched in S phase cells clearly showed a higher promoter activity compared with fractions dominated by G1 cells. It was earlier demonstrated that the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to mouse cells causes a rapid increase in the levels of R1 and R2 transcripts. This was reported to be the result of mRNA stabilization caused by protein binding to a specific regulatory 49-nucleotide element in the 3′-UTR of the mRNA. However, no studies on cell cycle-regulated R1 gene expression were reported (13Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To study mRNA stabilization as a mechanism for regulating the R1 mRNA levels during the cell cycle, we introduced the putative regulatory 49-mer from the R1 gene into the luciferase reporter gene. The 49-mer was introduced upstream from the luciferase poly(A) signal in the 3′-UTR region of the luciferase gene; therefore, it is included in the luciferase mRNA. Our mosaic luciferase gene was under the control of the SV40 promoter and enhancer. This construct and a control plasmid without the 49-mer was introduced into Balb/3T3 cells, and stably transformed clones were synchronized by serum starvation. An excess of mRNA containing the 49-mer might lead to loss of regulation due to exhaustion of regulatory proteins. Therefore, clones with very different levels of mRNA (luciferase activity ranging from 151 LU/μg to 144499 LU/μg) were analyzed. Cells containing the control plasmid showed the same expression pattern as five different clones containing the 49-mer plasmid, and no clones showed any S phase-specific luciferase expression (data not shown). Earlier R1 promoter-reporter gene constructs indicated that cell cycle-specific expression of the R1 gene required the Inr and γ elements, whereas there seemed to be no requirement for the α/β elements (11Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This puzzled us since we could demonstrate S phase-specific binding to the α/β oligonucleotide (complex C) in gel shift assays (8Björklund S. Hjortsberg K. Johansson E. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11322-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To analyze if the α and β footprints were important for the R1 promoter strength, we performed a series of transient transfection assays in logarithmically growing cells. First, we made a deletion analysis of the R1 promoter. These constructs were cotransfected with an SV40-driven Renilla luciferase gene to normalize for transfection efficiency. No significant difference in promoter strength was seen as the promoter was shortened from 5.7 kb to 420 bp in our R1 promoter-reporter gene constructs (Fig. 1). The deletion of the β footprint (pGL3R1 287) did not cause any dramatic reduction in promoter strength; in contrast, a mutation in the remaining α footprint caused a 50–60% decrease in promoter strength (pGL3R1 287 (−85/−81) compared with pGL3R1 287). The importance of the Inr and γ regions was again clearly demonstrated as the promoter activity decreased to about 20%, when either region was mutated in the presence of the α and β footprints. Interestingly, a construct containing only the α and β footprints, pGL3R1 α/β, completely lacking the Inr element and γ region, showed a higher promoter activity than the empty pGL3 vector. In contrast, a promoter lacking both functional α/β footprints and Inr element, pGL3R1 177, was as inactive as the empty vector. After this crude functional characterization of the promoter regions, we wanted to make a more detailed study on the α footprint. Therefore, additional constructs were made with point mutations within the α footprint (Fig. 4 B). As in the previous experiments, the constructs were cotransfected with a plasmid containing an SV40-driven Renilla luciferase gene to normalize for transfection efficiency. The results from a series of transient transfection experiments, summarized in Fig. 4, show that all our point mutations in the α footprint decreased the promoter activity in logarithmically growing cells to about 40–55% of wild-type activity with mutations in the center of the footprint being somewhat less active than mutations in the 5′or 3′-ends. The different regions of the α footprint may bind different proteins important under different cell cycle phases. Therefore, we synchronized the cells by serum starvation after the transient transfection (Fig. 5 at 0 h). Again, mutations in the center of the α footprint (−91/−86 and −85/−81) lowered the promoter activity more than mutations in the 5′- or 3′-ends. The synchronized cells were then released by serum readdition and harvested at different time points. The promoter activity of the wild-type construct was low in G0/G1 cells and started to increase in S phase cells (Fig. 5). A maximal promoter activity was reached after 20 h when there was a maximal number of S phase cells. This value was 3.4 times higher than the 0-h value. The mutated α footprint constructs all showed the same pattern, but maximal promoter activity was only comparable with the wild-type G0/G1 value (Fig. 5). This indicates that the α footprint is important for total R1 promoter activity. A data bank search was performed for sequences in the α or β footprints that could be recognized by already known transcription factors. The result suggested that YY1 should bind to both the α and β footprints, since they both contain the YY1 consensus binding sequence AANATGG. This was tested using a labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the β footprint and a crude nuclear extract from mouse fibroblasts in gel shift assays (Fig. 6). All three previously reported complexes, A, B, and C, were competed with unlabeled β footprint oligonucleotide. An unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to a YY1 binding DNA element in the c-Myc promoter clearly competed complexes B and C, but only to a smaller extent complex A. The sequence of the putative YY1 binding site in the β footprint was mutated in an oligonucleotide (R1 β (−YY1)). This mutated β footprint competed complex A but not complexes B and C. Next, we used a supershift antibody that recognizes YY1. This antibody specifically inhibited the formation of complexes B and C, indicating that YY1 is involved in the formation of these complexes (Fig. 7). Antibodies recognizing SRF or DP-2 did not inhibit the formation of or supershifted any complex (Fig. 7). The antibodies recognizing the CCAAT binding transcription factor NF-Y, subunit a or b, did not affect any of the three complexes (data not shown).Figure 7A gel shift assay using labeled α footprint oligonucleotide and supershift antibodies specific for YY1, SRF, or DP-2. Lane 1, labeled α oligonucleotide; lanes 2–5, oligonucleotide with nuclear extract (10 μg) from exponentially growing cells; lane 3, supershift antibody recognizing YY1 was added; lane 4, supershift antibody recognizing SRF was added; lane 5, supershift antibody recognizing DP-2 was added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mutations inserted in the α footprint in the previously described functional analyses were also analyzed in gel shift assays. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the different mutated α footprints (Fig. 4 B) were labeled and mixed with crude nuclear extracts from logarithmically growing cells. The −79/−77, −85/−81, and −91/−86 mutations all overlap the known consensus binding sequence of YY1. As expected, complex B could not be formed or was severely affected by all these mutations (Fig. 8). Complex A was only affected in the mutation −91/−86. Complex C (the S phase-specific complex) was affected by all mutations, but only to a small extent by the −97/−93 mutation. The different DNA-protein complexes most likely consist of several different proteins, since a new complex b′ appeared with all the four mutated α oligonucleotides (Fig. 8). In an attempt to identify other transcription factors that participate in complexes A, B, and C, we performed a yeast one-hybrid screening using five copies of the α footprint as the target element. After establishing a yeast strain containing both the pHis-1 and pLacz reporter genes, 238,000 independent clones were screened, and 13 clones survived on the selective medium and expressed β-galactosidase. The plasmids expressing the DNA binding activity in these yeast clones were isolated, used to transfect E. coli and subsequently sequenced. Four of the clones expressed the DNA binding domain of YY1 fused to GAL4AD. Our data from promoter-reporter gene constructs in stably transformed cells indicate that all elements required for a correct cell cycle regulation of the mouse R1 gene expression can be found within the proximal 420 bp of the R1 promoter. No indication for post-transcriptional regulation of cell cycle-dependent R1 gene expression was observed. Earlier data suggested that the α and β footprints were not required for the cell cycle regulation of the R1 promoter (11Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our transient transfection assays now clearly show that the α and β footprints are important for the overall R1 promoter activity. In the transient transfection assays in synchronized cells, the mutations in the α footprint did not significantly alter the expression pattern during G1-S transition, but the maximal level of mutant promoter activity in S phase was only comparable with the activity of the wild-type construct in quiescent cells. This level of promoter activity does not give rise to measurable levels of R1 mRNA in resting cells (5Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Gel shift assays with supershift antibodies, competition experiments, and yeast one-hybrid screening showed that the transcription factor YY1 binds to the α and β footprints and forms complex B. This complex was earlier shown not to vary during the cell cycle (8Björklund S. Hjortsberg K. Johansson E. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11322-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). YY1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor with many functions. It can activate, repress, and initiate transcription (19Shrivastava A. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In the R1 promoter, YY1 normally does not initiate transcription at the α and β footprints, since S1 nuclease analysis has shown that the transcription start is at the R1 Inr and not located to the two footprints (8Björklund S. Hjortsberg K. Johansson E. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11322-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, YY1 does not bind to the R1 Inr (11Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, there is a possibility that in our transient transfection assays, YY1 may initiate transcription at the α/β footprints in the R1 promoter when the Inr and γ elements are deleted. It has been shown in in vitro transcription experiments that YY1 can initiate transcription on supercoiled plasmids in the presence of only TFIIB and RNA pol II (20Usheva A. Shenk T. Cell. 1994; 76: 1115-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21Usheva A. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is not unlikely that this can occur inside cells as they are transfected with supercoiled plasmids. YY1 activates or represses transcription by binding to DNA elements that often show a very complex structure. Repression may occur as a result of interaction with histone deacetylases (22Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). There are often several factors that can bind to the element, sometimes with overlapping binding sites. YY1 can inhibit the binding of SRF (23MacLellan W.R. Lee T.-C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gualberto A. LePage D. Pons G. Mader S.L. Park K. Atchison M.L. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) but also facilitate the binding of SRF (25Natesan S. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has been shown that NF1 and YY1 both can activate the human p53 promoter by alternative binding to a composite element (26Furlong E.M. Rein T. Martin F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5933-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To make these elements even more complicated, c-Myc has been shown to regulate YY1 activity via protein-protein interactions to DNA-bound YY1 (27Shrivastava A. Saleque S. Kalpana G.V. Artandi S. Goff S.P. Calame K. Science. 1993; 262: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 28Shrivastava A., Yu, J. Artandi S. Goff S.P. Calame K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10638-10641Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A comparison with different YY1-binding elements showed that the R1 α and β footprints are nearly identical to a serum response element in the skeletal α-actin promoter (SRE1 nt −93 to nt −77) (23MacLellan W.R. Lee T.-C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This element contains a consensus binding site, 5′-CCAAATATGG-3′, for SRF. However, this site is not present in the R1 α and β footprints, and SRF does not bind to the α/β footprints (Fig. 7). We took advantage of linker-scanning mutations in the SRE1 of the skeletal α-actin promoter in an attempt to characterize the functional role of YY1 binding to the R1 promoter. There are three different mutations in the SRE1 that binds only SRF, only YY1, or neither YY1 nor SRF (23MacLellan W.R. Lee T.-C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation that inhibits only YY1 from binding to the SRE1 was also found to inhibit the binding of YY1 to the R1 α footprint (−79/−77) (Fig. 8). In contrast, the mutation in the SRE1 that only blocks SRF from binding to the element not only inhibited complex A but also YY1 from binding to the α footprint (−91/−86). From these results, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding the function of complex A. However, the results suggest that YY1 functions as an activator in the R1 promoter. Complex C appeared to be severely affected by any mutation across the α footprint except for (−97/−93). Both the competition gel shift experiments and the gel shift with the YY-1 antibody suggest that the formation of complex C is dependent on complex B (YY1). The appearance of a new DNA-protein complex b′ in all the gel shifts using a mutated α oligonucleotide indicates the participation of more than one protein in the complexes or multiple DNA-protein interactions. We can only speculate on how YY1 activates the R1 promoter at this stage. One mechanism can be to facilitate the formation of the S phase-specific complex C. However, it is interesting that YY1 is required for cell cycle-regulated transcription from E2F-1-dependent promoters (29van Ginkel P.R. Hsiao K.-M. Schjerven H. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16754-16760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At the same time, NF-Y was reported to have a similar function as YY1. We did not find that NF-Y binds to the α or β footprints, ruling out the possibility of a common factor between the mouse R1 and R2 promoters. A further characterization of the proteins that bind to the α and β footprints may clarify how YY1 activates the R1 promoter. We thank S. Skog, B. Tribukait, and K. Persson for flow cytometry measurements."

Prostaglandins are synthesized by a pair of isozymes referred to as prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-1 and -2 (PGHS-1 and PGHS-21; or cyclooxygenase-1 and -2) (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). The first of these enzymes is expressed constitutively and produces prostaglandins acutely that modulate cellular responses to hormonal stimulation. Prostaglandins produced by PGHS-1 are also responsible for regulating platelet aggregation and vascular homeostasis. In contrast, PGHS-2 is constitutively present in only a few tissues, but its expression can be induced in almost any cell in response to mitogenic and inflammatory stimuli. PGHS-2 is expressed at sites of inflammation in response to inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide, and its expression is inhibited by glucocorticoids and anti-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that it produces prostaglandins that mediate inflammation. The anti-inflammatory properties of selective inhibitors of PGHS-2 support this role (2Masferrer J.L. Zweifel B.S. Manning P.T. Hauser S.D. Leahy K.M. Smith W.G. Isakson P.C. Seibert K. Proc. Natl.

Examination of the primary amino acid sequence predicted from the ovine PGHS-1 cDNA (11DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1212-1416Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Recently, analysis of the crystal structure of the ovine PGHS-1 (15Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 16Picot D. Garavito R.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) has suggested an alternative mechanism for membrane association of the PGHS isozymes. Picot et al. (15Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) found that the PGHS-1 is a compact globular protein with no obvious hydrophobic hinge regions or loops that might act as a transmembrane anchor. Instead, they proposed that hydrophobic amino acids contained in four short α-helices located between residues 71 and 120 of PGHS-1 and residues 58 and 115 of PGHS-2 form hydrophobic surfaces that bind membranes, most likely by interacting with a single leaflet of the lipid bilayer (15Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). These amphipathic α-helices represent a new structural motif for stable membrane association distinct from the classical hydrophobic α-helices that transverse the entire lipid bilayer. Subsequent work using labeling with 3-trifluoro-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine, a hydrophobic photo-activated cross-linking agent, have confirmed that sequences located in the first half of the PGHS-1 are in contact with the membrane (17Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9906-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but until now the membrane-binding properties of the α-helices have not been tested directly. We have constructed fusion proteins containing various portions of the amino termini of the PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 proteins and now show that only those constructs that contain the α-helical amphipathic helices are correctly targeted to and associate with the ER and nuclear membranes. Six different expression plasmids were constructed containing amino-terminal sequences of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 joined to the amino terminus of the green fluorescent protein gene from Aequorea victoria (GFP). These plasmids were constructed using the parent plasmid pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), which contains the coding sequence for GFP. Fig. 1 presents a diagram of the plasmid constructs, and their construction is described below. A 0.26-kbXhoI/PvuII fragment containing the sequence coding for the first 72 amino acids of the human PGHS-1 2Numbering of the amino acid sequences are for the human PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, where the translational start methionine is Met-1. was constructed by PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers that contained addedXhoI and PvuII recognition sites. Amino acids 1–72 contain the signal peptide, EGF homology domain, and firstN-glycosylation site but not the putative membrane-binding helices of PGHS-1 (Fig. 1). The PGHS-1 fragment was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 plasmid that had been prepared by first digesting withEcoRI, filling in the overhanging ends with polymerase I Klenow fragment, and digesting a second time with XhoI. The amino acids, RRSTEL, which are present at the carboxyl termini of mouse PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, have been proposed to act as ER retention signal for these isozymes (18Song I. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Homologous sequences are also present in all other PGHSs that presumably function similarly, although only the final four amino acids, STEL, are strictly conserved between species. To test what effect this putative retention signal had on protein localization in mouse 3T3 cells, plasmids were constructed that expressed fusion proteins with and without the murine RRSTEL sequence. These amino acids were added to the end of the PGHS-GFP by ligating a complementary pair of oligonucleotides (5′-TACAAGAGGCGTCGTTCAACTGAGCTGTAAG-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCTTACAGCTCAGTTGAACGCCTCTT-3′) into theBsrGI/NotI-digested pEGF-PGHS-1 plasmid. A 0.46-kbXhoI/PvuII PCR fragment containing the sequence coding for the first 139 amino acids of PGHS-1 was amplified and subcloned into XhoI/EcoRI-digested pEGFP-N1 as described for PGHS-1-EGF-STEL. Amino acids 1–139 contain the signal peptide, EGF homology domain, first N-glycosylation site, and the putative membrane-binding helices of PGHS-1. To construct the expression plasmid pPGHS-1-EGF-MBD-STEL, the amino acids RRSTEL were added to the carboxyl terminus of the GFP coding sequence by ligating a complementary pair of oligonucleotides into theBsrGI/NotI-digested pPGHS-1-EGF-MBD plasmid as described previously for construction of pPGHS-1-EGF-STEL. To construct the expression plasmid pPGHS-2-EGF-STEL, a 0.22-kb XhoI/PvuII PCR fragment coding for the first 58 amino acids of the human PGHS-2 was first subcloned into pEGFP-N1 as described for pPGHS-1-EGF-STEL. Amino acids 1–58 contain the signal peptide, EGF homology domain, and first N-glycosylation site of PGHS-2. Next, the amino acids RRSTEL were added to the carboxyl terminus of the GFP coding sequence by ligating a complementary pair of oligonucleotides into theBsrGI/NotI-digested plasmid as described for construction of pPGHS-1-EGF-STEL. To construct the pPGHS-2-EFG-MBD expression plasmid, a 0.45-kb XhoI-ApaI PCR fragment containing cDNA sequence coding for the first 137 amino acids of the murine PGHS-2 was subcloned intoXhoI/ApaI-digested pEGFP-N1. Amino acids 1–137 contain the signal peptide, EGF homology domain, first twoN-glycosylation sites, and the amphipathic membrane-binding helices of PGHS-2. The amino acids RRSTEL were added to the carboxyl terminus of the PGHS-2-EGF-MBD coding sequence to form pPGHS-2-EGF-MBD-STEL by ligating a complementary pair of oligonucleotides into the BsrGI/NotI-digested plasmid as described for construction of pPGHS-1-EGF-STEL. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the PGHS coding sequences were properly inserted and in-frame with the GFP coding sequences. DNA was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were examined for fusion protein expression using an InsightII confocal fluorescent microscope (Meridian Instruments) 18 h following transfection or by Western blotting 18–30 h following transfection. The pattern of staining was similar for all cells transfected with a given plasmid and did not vary with the relative level of expression of the fluorescent proteins, suggesting that the efficiency of expression, or cellular concentration of the fusion proteins, was not a factor affecting subcellular targeting. The mobility of the PGHS-GFP fusion proteins in live cells was examined by monitoring the recovery of fluorescence after photo-bleaching (FRAP) with an ACAS laser microscope (ACAS 570, Meridian Instruments) (21Swaisgood M. Schindler M. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To examine the pattern of glycosylation of fusion proteins, tunicamycin (Sigma) was added (1 μg/ml) to cells for 23 h, beginning 5 h post-transfection. The cells were then lysed using RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Aliquots of the lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Transfected cells were scraped from plates into RSB buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2) and were collected by centrifugation. Cells were next resuspended in 5.5 ml of RSB buffer and sonicated at maximum power with a microprobe tip 6 × for 10 s on ice (Misonix) and then centrifuged at 8,000 × g (10 min). The pellet from this centrifugation step (see Fig. 4, N), which contains nuclei and other particulate cellular components, was reserved for Western analysis, whereas the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged a second time for 45 min at 40,000 ×g. The pellet from this 40,000 × gcentrifugation (see Fig. 4, M) contains microsomal membranes, and the supernatant contains the remaining soluble cytosolic proteins. Protein samples were fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS and then transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) using a Bio-Rad Trans-blot unit and transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. After incubating the blotted PVDF membrane in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-Cl, containing 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.1% Tween 20 detergent (TBS-T) and 5% non-fat milk for 2 h to block nonspecific protein absorption, the membrane was further incubated for 2 h with affinity purified isozyme-specific rabbit antisera for human PGHS-1 (11DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1212-1416Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar) or PGHS-2 (20DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), or with mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) diluted (1:1500) in TBST containing 1% milk. The PVDF membrane was washed 3 × in TBST alone and then incubated an additional hour with either horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Bio-Rad). After three washes, the fusion proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using Renaissance reagent (NEN Life Science Products). The diffusion coefficients of the PGHS-GFP fusion proteins were determined using an ACAS 570 (Meridian) computer controlled laser microscope and FRAP software (21Swaisgood M. Schindler M. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A 0.5-μm area was bleached using a laser power of 200 milliwatts for 10–80 ms. Only those measurements in which there was at least a 60% recovery of fluorescence were used for determination of diffusion coefficients. A series of expression plasmids in which the amino termini of the PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 isozymes were joined to the cDNA of the GFP of A. victoria (Fig. 1) were constructed to test whether these amphipathic α-helices are responsible for association of the PGHS isozymes with the endoplasmic and nuclear membranes. These plasmids expressed chimeric proteins of GFP joined with the amino-terminal sequences of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, with and without the putative membrane binding domains. The plasmids pPGHS-1-EGF-MBD and pPGHS-2-EGF-MBD (Fig. 1) code for the first 139 and 136 amino acids of human PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, respectively,2which includes, in order, the signal peptide sequences, EGF homology domains, first and second N-glycosylation sites, and putative membrane-binding (MBD) helices, followed by coding sequence for GFP. The plasmids PGHS-1-EGF-MBD-STEL and PGHS-2-EGF-MBD-STEL have in addition the amino acids RRSTEL added to the carboxyl terminus of the GFP protein. This sequence, found on the carboxyl termini of all PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, has been reported to be necessary for retention of these enzymes within the endoplasmic reticulum (18Song I. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the plasmids pPGHS-1-EGF-STEL and pPGHS-2-EGF-STEL, the putative membrane binding domain has been deleted. The plasmids GFP and GFP-STEL code for the GFP protein alone and GFP protein with the added RRSTEL sequence. To determine whether the PGHS-GFP fusion proteins were synthesized correctly following transfection into 3T3 fibroblasts, their expression was examined using Western blotting (Fig. 2). Proteins from homogenates of 3T3 cells transfected with the various expression plasmids were separated by PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The GFP and PGHS-GFP fusion proteins were visualized using a monoclonal antibody against GFP. As can be seen in Fig. 2, this monoclonal anti-GFP antibody reacted specifically with proteins of the correct apparent M r (29,000) in homogenates of cells transfected with the plasmids pGFP (GFP) or pGFP-STEL (GFP-STEL). This antibody also cross-reacted nonspecifically with a protein that migrates with an apparent M rof 50,000 (Fig. 2) that is present constitutively in 3T3 cells. The molecular masses of the PGHS-1- and PGHS-2-GFP fusion proteins predicted from their amino acid sequences, and assuming that their signal peptides are removed, are 41.7 and 41.5 kDa, respectively. The apparent M r of the major immunoreactive bands in cells transfected with the PGHS-1 plasmids pPGHS-1-EGF-MBD and pPGHS-1-EGF-MBD-STEL was 43,000 (Fig. 2), and a minor band of about 42,000 was also observed with PGHS-1-EGF-MBD. The GFP fusion proteins expressed in cells transfected with the PGHS-2 plasmids PGHS-2-MBD-EGF and PGHS-2-MBD-EGF-STEL had a slightly higher apparentM r of 44,500. The 43,000–44,500 apparent M r of the PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 fusion proteins is 2000–3000 larger than would have been predicted from the amino acid sequences of these proteins alone. This apparent size increase could have resulted from the expectedN-glycosylation of these proteins, at aspargine 68 in PGHS-1 and asparagines 53 and 130 in PGHS-2 (22Swaminathan R. Hoang C.P. Verkma A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), or from failure to cleave the signal peptides. To differentiate between these two possibilities, tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, was added to cells 5 h following transfection. Treatment with tunicamycin reduced the apparent M r of the PGHS-1-EGF-MBD protein to 41,500 from 43,000 (Fig. 2) and of the PGHS-2-EGF-MBD protein to 41,500 from 44,500 (Fig. 2). A similar reduction in the presence of tunicamycin was observed for the proteins expressed by the PGHS-1-MBD-EGF-STEL and PGHS-2-MBD-EGF-STEL plasmids. These results demonstrate that the fusion proteins were glycosylated and indicate that the signal peptides were removed. The most likely explanation for the larger size of the glycosylated PGHS-2-GFP compared with glycosylated PGHS-1-GFP is that the PGHS-2-GFP fusion proteins were glycosylated at both Asn-53 and Asn-130, whereas the PGHS-1-GFP fusion proteins were glycosylated only once, at Asn-68. Confocal fluorescent microscopy was used to determine if the putative MBD domains of the PGHS proteins could anchor the PGHS-GFP proteins to ER and nuclear membranes (Fig. 3). About 30% of 3T3 cells had visible fluorescence 18 h following transfection with the PGHS-GFP expression plasmids. Cells transfected with PGHS-1-MBD-GFP and PGHS-2-MBD-GFP, which express the PGHS-1-GFP and PGHS-2-GFP fusion proteins that contain amphipathic α-helices, showed an intense peri-nuclear ring of fluorescence and strong fluorescence in the cytoplasmic space which was irregular and appeared to be associated with distinct reticular structures (Fig. 3, A and D), and was excluded from the nuclear space. An identical pattern of fluorescence was observed in cells transfected with PGHS-1-MBD-STEL and PGHS-2-MBD-STEL (Fig. 3, B and E). The localization of these proteins contrasted with that of GFP (Fig. 3 G), which was uniform throughout the cytoplasmic and nuclear spaces, did not form a perinuclear ring, and did not appear to be associated with any subcellular structures. The staining pattern obtained from expression of all four PGHS-GFP fusion proteins containing membrane binding domains was identical to the fluorescent patterns observed previously using indirect immunofluorescent staining to localize the native PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 proteins in 3T3 cells (9Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A distinctly different staining pattern was observed following transfection of the plasmids PGHS-1-EGF-STEL and PGHS-2-EGF-STEL, which code for the PGHS-GFP fusion proteins that do not contain the putative membrane association helices. The fluorescence from these proteins was irregularly distributed throughout the cytoplasmic space and was excluded from the nucleus as were the MBD-containing chimeras (Fig. 3,C and F); however, unlike the MBD-containing chimeras, these proteins gave a very diffuse fluorescence which had the appearance of being fuzzy and unfocused in the micrographs. Another notable difference in the staining pattern of PGHS-GFP fusion proteins with no MBD sequences was the absence of a distinct perinuclear ring of fluorescence (compared Fig. 3, C and F, with Fig. 3, A and B and D and E) that is characteristic of MBD-containing constructs and was also observed during immunocytochemical localization of the native PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 enzymes (9Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diffuse fluorescence and lack of a defined nuclear ring suggested that proteins without the MBD might be targeted to the ER lumen but were not membrane-associated. To determine directly whether the PGHS-GFP chimeric proteins were membrane-associated, we next examined the distribution of native PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 and the PGHS-GFP fusion proteins in particulate and soluble fractions of the transfected cells using Western blotting analysis. Cells transfected with the PGHS-GFP fusion plasmids or the control GFP plasmids were disrupted by sonication and separated into three subcellular fractions that corresponded roughly to nuclei, endoplasmic reticular membranes, and soluble cytoplasmic proteins (Fig. 4,S). It has previously been demonstrated that the PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are integral membrane proteins that are associated exclusively with the nuclear pellet and microsomal fractions (Fig. 4, N and M). Those fusion proteins that contained the amphipathic α-helices, PGHS-1-EGF-MBD-STEL and PGHS-2-EGF-MBD-STEL, also fractionated with the microsomal and nuclear membrane fractions in a ratio similar to that observed for the native PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 (Fig. 4, A and B). In some transfections, the PGHS-2-EGF-MBD-STEL fusion protein was present in cytoplasmic fractions at higher concentrations than is observed for the native proteins, suggesting that processing of the fusion proteins may not be as efficient as for the native proteins. As would be predicted from the results of the fluorescent localization experiments, the fusion proteins that do not contain the membrane binding domains, PGHS-1-EGF-STEL and PGHS-2-EGF-STEL, do not associate with particulate cells fractions and were present only in the soluble cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 4, A and B). The control GFP and GFP-STEL proteins were found exclusively in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 4 C, S). The constraints of molecular movement within the lipid bilayer results in coefficients of diffusion (D) for integral membrane proteins that are approximately 2 orders of magnitude slower than soluble proteins. To provide further evidence for the subcellular localization of the PGHS-GFP fusion proteins, we examined the diffusional mobility of GFP and the various PGHS-GFP chimeras using fluorescent recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) (19Cole N.B. Smith C.L. Sciaky N. Terasaki M. Edidin M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 1996; 273: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In this method, a laser attached to a microscope bleaches the fluorescence from a small defined area within a live cell. The time required for fluorescence to return to that site can be used to estimate the mobility of the fluorescent protein. The coefficient of diffusion (D) for GFP has previously been measured as 8.7 × 10−7 cm2s−1 in saline buffer (22Swaminathan R. Hoang C.P. Verkma A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). By analyzing GFP expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, these same researchers demonstrated that translational diffusion of this protein is approximately 3.2-fold slower in live cells, a change that would lower its coefficient of diffusion to approximately 2 × 10−7 cm2s−1 in cell cytoplasm (22Swaminathan R. Hoang C.P. Verkma A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The most rapid rate of diffusion that could be measured under the conditions we employed corresponds to a D = 1.5 × 10−7cm2 s−1. For the majority of measurements (17/26), D values for GFP in live transfected 3T3 cells were greater than 1 × 10−7 cm2s−1; most were too fast to measure (Table I). These observations are consistent with the previous measurements (22Swaminathan R. Hoang C.P. Verkma A.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1900-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In a distinct subset of measurements (9/26), however, D values were obtained for GFP that averaged 2.5 ± 1.8 × 10−8 cm2s−1. Although we have no explanation for the existence of two populations of GFP molecules with widely varying diffusion characteristics, the second slower population may represents dimers or other aggregates of GFP formed due to high level expression of this protein within cells (26Chalfie M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).Table IDiffusion coefficients (D) of GFP and GFP-PGHS chimeras in intact 3T3 cellsChimeraDvalueMeasurements× 10−9 cm2s−1nGFP>1001-aThere was a distinct bimodal distribution of D values for GFP. 17/26 measurements gave D≥1 × 10−7 cm2 s−1.

One explanation for this bimodal distribution may be that at high levels of expression aggregation of GFP may occur.

Open table in a new tab Cells were transfected with the indicated constructs (see Fig. 1), and the diffusion coefficients were determined by FRAP analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” The diffusion coefficients of PGHS-GFP chimeras without the MBD sequences averaged 1.3 × 10−8 cm2s−1 (Table I). Although these values are 10 times slower than the fastest values obtained for GFP, they are 10-fold faster than the rates we obtained for GFP constructs that contain the MBD and also an order of magnitude faster than rates previously measured for other integral membrane proteins (19Cole N.B. Smith C.L. Sciaky N. Terasaki M. Edidin M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 1996; 273: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The median diffusional coefficient of the GFP chimeras containing the MBD sequences was 2 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 (Table I), a rate which is similar to the diffusion coefficients determined for ER-localized galactosyltransferase-GFP (D = 2.1 × 10−9 cm2 s−1) and the KDEL receptor GFP (D = 2.6 × 10−9cm2 s−1) (19Cole N.B. Smith C.L. Sciaky N. Terasaki M. Edidin M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 1996; 273: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The presence of the RRSTEL tail on the PGHS-GFP constructs did not have any significant effect on the mobility of the PGHS-GFP fusion proteins (Table I). Because nuclear and microsomal membrane fractions of 3T3 cells were fractionated on the basis of their specific density using centrifugation techniques, there is the possibility that the PGHS-GFP fusion proteins co-purified with these fractions because they were denatured and insoluble and not because they were intrinsically associated with the membranes of these organelles. To test this possibility, we examined the detergent solubility of the fusion proteins. Microsomal membrane preparations of transfected and untransfected cells were isolated, and aliquots of these microsomal membranes were resuspended into buffer with and without 0.5% Nonidet P-40 detergent. After a final centrifugation at 100,000 ×g, the supernatants and pellets from these spins were analyzed by Western blotting. In the absence of detergent, both the native and fusion proteins remained in the microsomal membrane pellet. Addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 detergent resulted in the solubilization of greater than 80% of the native PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 as well as the PGHS-1-EGF-MBD-STEL and PGHS-2-EGF-MBD-STEL (Fig. 5). The results from these experiments are consistent with the results from the photo-bleaching experiments and indicate that the fusion proteins containing the MBD were membrane-associated. To test the hypothesis that four amphipathic α-helices near the amino-terminal of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 act as membrane binding domains for these enzymes, we constructed a series of chimeric proteins with PGHS sequences joined to the green fluorescent protein of A. victoria, and we examined the subcellular distribution and membrane association of these proteins by fluorescent microscopy, Western blotting, and FRAP analysis. We examined fusion proteins containing the entire amino termini of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 with and without the putative membrane binding sequences, instead of fusion proteins containing only the putative membrane binding domains (MBD), because it seemed probable that the amino-terminal sequences preceding these MBDs would be required for targeting of the PGHS fusion proteins to the luminal endoplasmic reticulum where they normally are integrated into the lipid bilayer. It also seems likely that correct folding of the membrane association helices would be required for membrane association and folding, in turn, would depend on the proper co-translational and post-translational modifications, e.g.signal peptide cleavage, glycosylation, and disulfide bond formation, of these same preceding amino-terminal sequences. Our analysis indicates that signal peptides are removed from the fusion proteins, and these proteins are glycosylated. In the presence of tunicamycin, the observed molecular weights of the largest unglycosylated PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 fusion proteins were close to the size (41,500) that would be predicted for these proteins following signal peptide cleavage. In the absence of tunicamycin, the apparent molecular weights of the PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 fusion proteins were 43,000 and 44,500, sizes that are consistent with modification of a singleN-glycosylation site present in PGHS-1 sequence and of the two N-glycosylation sites present in the PGHS-2 sequence. Our experimental results indicate that the putative membrane binding domains in PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are responsible for membrane association, as only those fusion proteins containing the amphipathic α-helices associated with membranes. Four separate lines of evidence support the conclusion that proteins that contain the putative membrane binding domain proteins are targeted to and stably associated with the ER and nuclear membranes. First, the fluorescent patterns of these proteins was identical to that observed for immunofluorescent staining of the native PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 proteins in 3T3 cells (Fig. 3) (9Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, Western blot analysis of these proteins showed the same distributions of PGHS-GFP proteins in the particular and soluble cell fractions as the native PGHSs (Fig. 4). Third, the mobility of the PGHS-GFP proteins was similar to other membrane proteins and 2 orders of magnitude slower than GFP alone. Finally, these proteins can be solubilized from microsomal membranes, demonstrating that they are not simply aggregated within the cell (Fig. 5). Deletion of the membrane binding domains in PGHS-1-EGF-STEL and PGHS-2-EGF-STEL prevented membrane association but did not appear to affect targeting of these proteins to the lumen of the ER. Evidence for this assumption derives from observations of the pattern of fluorescence following expression of chimeras that do not contain the MBD sequences. This pattern was similar to that of the fusion proteins that contain membrane binding domains, in that it was restricted to the cytoplasmic space and appeared to be associated with specific structures within that space. However, the fluorescence pattern of proteins without MBDs was diffuse and lacked a defined perinuclear ring (Fig. 3). Our interpretation of this staining pattern is that the proteins lacking the MBD were targeted to the lumen of the ER but did not then associate with the membrane. We hypothesize that the diffuse distribution of these soluble proteins within the ER lumen leads to the hazy fluorescence and that the lack of membrane association prevents the concentration of these proteins on the membranes surrounding the nucleus, an organization which was observed as a perinuclear ring. Western blot analysis confirms that proteins without the MBD were soluble and were released upon homogenization of cells. It is curious that the diffusion coefficients for the PGHS-GFP chimeric proteins that do not contain membrane binding domains are intermediate between soluble GFP and the membrane-associated PGHS-GFP proteins that do contain MBD domains. We know of no other studies that have examined the mobility of soluble luminal ER proteins. One possible explanation for the apparently slower rate of diffusion is that, as suggested above, the chimeric proteins are present in the reticular lumen of the ER, which may geometrically constrain diffusion of macromolecules, at least within the relatively large area (0.5 μm) where bleaching occurs. Alternatively, the luminal cytoplasm may be more viscous than the extra-luminal cytoplasm. Another possibility is that the chimera proteins aggregate to form multimers and that the observed diffusional coefficients reflects the true rate of translation diffusion of these higher molecular weight oligomers. Finally, proteins that lack the MBD may nevertheless be constrained by protein-protein interactions within the cell. It is important to note, however, that in the absence of the MBD domain, the chimeric proteins all had coefficients of diffusion that are at least 10 times faster than any known membrane proteins, so it is unlikely that these proteins are stably associated with membranes. The role of the peptide sequence STEL, which is found in the carboxyl termini of all PGHS, was also investigated. This sequence has been postulated to serve as an ER retention signal (18Song I. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we saw no obvious effect of this sequence on the distribution of PGHS-GFP fusion proteins. Proteins containing the membrane binding domains were localized to the ER and nuclear particulate fractions in a manner identical to the native proteins independent of whether they contained an STEL sequence. We did examine whether PGHS-GFP fusion proteins that did not contain either MBD and STEL sequences would be secreted from transfected 3T3 cells, but no significant secretion of these fusion proteins was detected. 33T3 cells were transfected with the plasmids pEGFP, PGHS-2-EGF-MBD-STEL, PGHS-2-EGF-STEL, and PGHS-2-EGF as described under “Materials and Methods.” Forty-eight hours following transfection, the fluorescent intensity (509 nm) of the culture media was determined using an Perkin-Elmer 640-40 fluorescent spectrophotometer set with an excitation frequency of 395 nm. No significant fluorescence was observed in the media from any of the transfections. Other proteins have been shown to use amphipathic α-helices to transiently bind to the membranes. One example is the CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (24Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whose activity has been reported to be regulated by reversible binding to the ER and nuclear membranes. The PGHS isozymes are, however, the first proteins identified that use amphipathic α-helices for stable membrane association. Recently, the structure of squalene cyclase has been determined (25Wendt K.U. Poralla K. Schulz G.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and amphipathic helices on this proteins have been postulated to serve as a membrane binding domains for this enzyme also. The amphipathic helices of the squalene cyclase and the PGHS have another potential functional similarity in that they also comprise the opening to the active sites of these enzymes. Since both enzymes are predicted to be positioned so that their membrane binding sequences rest in the lipid bilayer, substrate and products must enter and exit the enzymes through the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Thus, this unique mode of membrane interaction probably has a functional significance and may be used by other enzymes that have hydrophobic substrates and products. The fact that the membrane binding domains of the PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are only 38% similar compared with the over 75% similarity between the catalytic domains of these two isozymes suggests that differences in membrane association could also play some role in regulating the differential activities and/or signaling of these enzymes. Although squalene cyclase and PGHS apparently share structurally similar membrane binding motifs, the amphipathic helices of these proteins have little or no sequence similarity. Indeed simple sequence analysis was not sufficient to identify the PGHS MBD sequences; their discovery depended on analysis of the crystal structures. It is likely that sequence homology to PGHS or squalene synthase will be insufficient to identify similar membrane binding domains in other proteins either. Thus, while a large family of integral membrane proteins anchored by amphipathic helices may exist, their discovery now depends on accumulation of additional structural information. Further study of the functional organization of the membrane binding helices of the PGHSs or the squalene synthase, however, may provide information in the future that can be used to predict the existence of these motifs from their primary sequences."

A signal sequence induces translocation of the C-terminally adjacent mature portion of a secretory protein. Similar topogenic function is assigned for a class of transmembrane sequences of membrane proteins. They are called signal anchor sequences and are thought to have a similar role in translocation of the following polypeptide segment as an ordinary signal sequence. Additionally, they function as a transmembrane anchor; they are not cleaved and become stably embedded in the lipid phase of the membrane. Membrane proteins with a single signal anchor sequence are called type II integral membrane proteins (1von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J.

Chem. 1985; 260: 1836-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lee J.-I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 938-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Whitley P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24523-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, different membrane protein segments may use the Sec translocase to different extents. However, mutational effects should be interpreted carefully, since different genetic systems could give different conclusions about the Sec factor requirement for integration of a membrane protein (17Traxler B.

Recent studies suggest that Ffh, 4.5 S RNA and FtsY, the components of the E. coli version of SRP, are involved in targeting of some membrane proteins (25Mac Farlane J. Müller M. Eur. J.

Finally, in addition to the above mentioned role of facilitating translocation, SecYEG complex may also have a role in the “stop transfer” mode of integration processes (31Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Sato K. Mori H. Yoshida M. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20082-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Each of the HflK and HflC proteins contains a single transmembrane region located at the N-terminal region, while their remaining domains are exposed to the periplasmic space (4Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). They form a complex, HflKC (5Cheng H.C. Muhlrad P.J. Hoyt M.A. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7882-7886Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and affect the stability of λ CII protein and thereby control the lysogenization frequency of this phage. Historically, identification of these proteins goes back to the isolation of thehflA class of E. coli mutations, which cause high frequency λ lysogenization (33Belfort M. Wulff D.L. The Bacteriophage Lambda. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor1971: 739-742Google Scholar). Sequencing studies later revealed that this genetic locus contains three genes, hflX of unknown function, hflK, and hflC (34Noble J.A. Innis M.A. Koonin E.V. Rudd K.E. Banuett F. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10866-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although it was proposed that HflKC is a protease that degrades the CII protein (5Cheng H.C. Muhlrad P.J. Hoyt M.A. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7882-7886Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we showed that this is not the case (4Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Instead, FtsH is the protease against CII (4Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and HflKC binds to FtsH (36Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and seems to modulate its activities against different substrates (4Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). HflKC directly binds to a membrane-embedded substrate of FtsH as well (37Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this work, we studied in vivo processes of translocation and assembly of HflK and HflC. It was found that they do not depend on the SecB or the SRP targeting system, but their translocation absolutely depends on the membrane components of the Sec translocase. This pair of membrane proteins can only exist stably as the HflKC complex in the cell.

KpnI fragments from the chromosomal DNA of strains Y1089 (with an insertion of Mu phage within hflA) (50Hoyt M.A. Knight D.M. Das A. Miller H.I. Echols H.

Similarly, chromosomal DNA from X9368 (hflK::Tn5) (44Banuett F. Hoyt M.A. McFarlane L. Echols H. Herskowitz I. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was digested withKpnI and EcoRI and ligated withKpnI-EcoRI-treated pMW119, yielding pKH165 with an insert of hflX-hflK::Tn5-hflC. Finally, we cloned the following fragments into M13 mp18 or M13 mp19: 2.1-kb DraI-SalI fragment of pKH278 (hflC1); 1.2-kb SalI-DraI (within Mu) fragment of pKH276 (hflC150); and 1.3-kbAatII-HindIII (within Tn5) fragment of pKH165 (hflK::Tn5). Single-stranded DNAs were sequenced (51Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

L medium (52Davis R.W. Bostein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar) and M9 medium (53Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984Google Scholar) were used. Ampicillin (50 μg/ml) was included for growing plasmid-bearing strains. Tetracycline (25 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) were added to L agar, as required, for selection of transductants. Immunoprecipitation of once denatured and SDS-solubilized proteins was done as described previously (54Taura T. Baba T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7771-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically blotted onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Millipore). The filter was decorated with antisera against HflKC (4Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), HflK (4Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), or FtsY (provided by the late Dr. S. Mizushima), which were then visualized with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antisera against HflKC and HflK had been preincubated with a cell lysate prepared from AK1136 (ΔhflK-hflC) to reduce backgrounds. -Cells were grown to an early log phase in M9 medium with indicated supplements, pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (from American Radiolabeled Chemicals) for indicated periods and chased with unlabeledl-methionine (200 μg/ml) for indicated periods. Samples were mixed with sodium azide (0.02%) and chloramphenicol (100 μg/ml) and chilled on ice. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 20% sucrose, followed by addition of 0.1 volume of 1 mg/ml lysozyme dissolved in 0.1m EDTA (pH 8.0) and incubation on ice for 30 min. Spheroplasts thus prepared were treated with proteinase K (50 μg/ml or 1 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 at 0 °C for 30 min, followed by termination of the digestion with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and precipitation of proteins with trichloroacetic acid. Samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation. Unlabeled cells were similarly processed and visualized by immunoblotting. The HflK and HflC proteins have their major domains exposed to the periplasmic side of the plasma membrane (4Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, these proteins in the intact spheroplasts were digested with a high concentration of proteinase K (Fig. 1 A, lane 5for HflK) (4Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Treatment of spheroplasts with a lower concentration (50 μg/ml) of proteinase K converted HflK into a fragment of apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane 2, band P1). Identity of this fragment was shown by its reactivity with the anti-HflK serum. Proteinase K treatment after solubilization of the membrane with Triton X-100 yielded a fragment that was further shortened to 38 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane 3, band P2). It is reasonable to assume that the N-terminal cytoplasmic and membrane anchor portions became proteinase K-accessible in the presence of the detergent. It is thus suggested that the C-terminal end of HflK is degraded by proteinase K while the remaining periplasmic domain is folded into a partially protease-resistant conformation (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, HflC is fully sensitive to the low concentration of proteinase K (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for spheroplasts from cells with overproduced HflK and HflC (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–3). When HflK alone was overproduced, however, it was degraded without producing the P1 or P2 fragments (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6). It is suggested that folding of HflKC into the partially protease-resistant conformation can occur only in the presence of HflC. It should be noted that HflK, once folded, can remain so even after HflC has been degraded. The above results provided a basis on which we could follow the processes of translocation and folding of the HflK and HflC proteins. Wild-type cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 min and then chased with unlabeled methionine. Spheroplasts were prepared from each sample and treated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K. HflK and HflC were then immunoprecipitated. All the pulse-labeled HflK and HflC proteins were already translocated to the periplasmic side, since they were digested completely with the protease (Fig. 2 A, upper panel, lane 2). Without chase, P1 and P2 fragments were only slightly produced, indicating that the majority of HflK was not yet folded into its characteristic conformation. Proportions of the P1 and P2 fragment increased with chase, reaching the maximal level at 2 min (lanes 8 and 9). These results demonstrate that translocation of HflK and HflC occurs within 1 min after their synthesis. This is followed by folding of HflK, taking some 1–2 min. The requirement for SecB was examined using thesecB::Tn5 mutant. Pulse-chase experiments showed that translocation of HflK and HflC in this mutant cells (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) was as rapid as in the wild-type cells. Thus, targeting/translocation of HflK and HflC does not require the SecB chaperone. The SecA requirement was examined using sodium azide, a specific inhibitor of this ATPase. When this chemical was added to the culture 1 min before pulse-labeling, both of the pulse-labeled HflK and HflC proteins escaped the proteinase K action (Fig. 2 B, lower panel, lanes 1 and 2), unless the membrane barrier was destroyed by a detergent (data not shown). Although some fraction of them became proteinase K accessible after chases for a few minutes (a small proportion of fragment P1 was also produced at these time points; lanes 10and 12), the results shown in Fig. 2 B clearly indicate that translocation of HflK and HflC was retarded strikingly when the SecA function was compromised by this inhibitor. The involvement of the membrane-bound Sec factors in biogenesis of the HflKC complex was examined using cold-sensitive mutants,secY39 (47Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and secD1 (48Gardel C. Benson S. Hunt J. Michaelis S. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1286-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to the nonpermissive temperature (20 °C) for 30 min and then subjected to the pulse-chase analysis. Translocation of HflK and HflC in wild-type cells was completed rapidly even at this low temperature (Fig. 2 C, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2), although subsequent attainment of the protease-resistant conformation required a longer chase (5–10 min) than at 37 °C (lanes 3–8). In sharp contrast, essentially all the pulse-labeled HflK and HflC proteins were protected from proteinase K digestion in the secY39 and secD1 mutant cells (Figs. 2 C, middle and bottom panels, lanes 1 and 2), and they remained so even after a chase for 30 min (lanes 9 and 10). These results show that the HflKC biogenesis strictly depends on the Sec translocase functions. Translocation of HflK and HflC was studied using the strain in which ftsY, coding for the E. colihomolog of the SRP receptor α subunit, was placed under the control of the araB promoter (49Luirink J. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting experiments showed that after growth in the absence of arabinose for 5 h, cellular abundance of FtsY decreased to 133 of that in the wild-type strain (Fig. 3 A). Pulse-chase analysis at this stage showed that translocation and folding kinetics of HflK and HflC in the FtsY-depleted cells (Fig. 3 B, lower panel) were indistinguishable from those in cells grown continuously in the presence of arabinose (upper panel). Thus, the SRP pathway is not involved in the membrane targeting of HflKC. As already discussed, the folding of HflK into the protease-resistant conformation seems to be dependent on the HflK-HflC interaction. In vivostability of unassembled forms of the HflK and the HflC subunits was studied by overproducing these proteins, individually or in combination, in a strain deleted for the chromosomal hflKand hflC genes. Pulse-chase experiments showed that singly expressed HflK and HflC were degraded with a half-life of about 12 min (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–6) and 18 min (Fig. 4 B, upper panel), respectively. These proteins, overproduced simultaneously, were completely stable (Fig. 4 A, lanes 19–24), indicating that they are stabilizing each other. The periplasmic disposition of HflK and HflC (4Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggests an involvement of a periplasmic protease in their degradation. We examined stability of the HflK and HflC subunits in mutants lacking one of periplasmic proteases, DegP (also called HtrA) (46Strauch K.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 55Lipinska B. Fayet O. Baird L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1574-1584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ptr (56Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2696-2703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Prc (also called Tsp) (57Hara H. Yamamoto Y. Higashitani A. Suzuki H. Nishimura Y. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4799-4813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was noted that degradation of HflK in wild-type cells was accompanied by putative degradation intermediates (I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-6, I-7, I-8, I-9, and I-10 in Fig. 4 A). In thedegP::kan mutant, degradation of the HflK subunit was significantly retarded (half-life of 20 min; Fig. 4 A, lanes 13–18). The prcΔ::neo mutant cells gave significantly altered patterns of degradation intermediates, although the half-life of the full-length HflK was not significantly changed (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7–12). In this mutant, I-6, I-7, and I-8 disappeared, whereas the intensity of I-3 increased and a new band, termed I-5, appeared (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7–12). Thus, degradation of HflK may be partly initiated by DegP to produce the I-3 intermediate, which is then cleaved by Prc. HflK degradation was not appreciably affected by the ptr mutation (data not shown). Degradation of HflC was not significantly affected by either prc (Fig. 4 B, middle panel),degP (Fig. 4 B, bottom panel), orptr (data not shown) mutation. No degradation intermediate of HflC was detected by the antibodies used. In early studies, several hflA class mutations were described as causing increased frequency of lysogenization of infecting bacteriophage λ. However, they have not been characterized fully in molecular terms. We determined nucleotide sequence changes of the hflA mutations.

https://openalex.org/W2038071092,"Aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) is a unique enzyme that can react with two types of substrate with quite different properties, acidic substrates, such as aspartate and glutamate, and neutral substrates, although the catalytic group Lys-258 acts on both types of substrate. The dynamic properties of the substrate-binding site are indispensable to the interaction with hydrophobic substrates (Kawaguchi, S., Nobe, Y., Yasuoka, J., Wakamiya, T., Kusumoto, S., and Kuramitsu, S. (1997) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 122, 55–63). AspATs from various organisms are classified into two subgroups, Ia and Ib. The former includes AspATs fromEscherichia coli and higher eukaryotes, whereas the latter includes those from Thermus thermophilus and many prokaryotes. The AspATs belonging to subgroup Ia each have an Arg-292 residue, which interacts with the distal carboxyl groups of dicarboxylic (acidic) substrates, but the functionally similar residue of subgroup Ib AspATs has not been identified. In view of the x-ray crystallographic structure of T. thermophilus AspAT, we expected Lys-109 to be this residue in the subgroup Ib AspATs and constructed K109V and K109S mutants. Replacing Lys-109 with Val or Ser resulted in loss of activity toward acidic substrates but increased that toward the neutral substrate, alanine, considerably. These results indicate that Lys-109 is a major determinant of the acidic substrate specificity of subgroup Ib AspATs. Kinetic analysis of the interactions with neutral substrates indicated that T. thermophilusAspAT is subject to less steric hindrance and its substrate-binding pocket has a more flexible conformation than E. coli AspAT. A flexible active site in the rigid T. thermophilus AspAT molecule may explain its high activity even at room temperature.

A number of aminotransferases with different substrate specificities have been identified, and their amino acid sequences have been reported. Aminotransferases are classified into four subgroups (I–IV), which, with exception of family III, are thought to have a common evolutionary origin (6Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Subgroup I includes aminotransferases that use aspartate, alanine, histidine, or an aromatic amino acid as the amino group donor, and many aminotransferases of this subgroup utilize common dicarboxylic acids (such as 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate). Under physiological conditions, aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) uses aspartate and glutamate as amino group donors and oxaloacetate and 2-oxoglutarate as amino group acceptors. The amino acid sequences of AspATs from eubacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes have been reported, and AspATs are divided into subgroups Ia and Ib according to their mutual homologies (7Alfano J.R. Kahn M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4186-4196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Okamoto A. Kato R. Masui R. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem.

To date, subgroup Ia includes the AspATs from eubacteria and eukaryotes, and subgroup Ib includes those from eubacteria and archaebacteria. The amino acid sequence identities between members of subgroup Ia are higher than 40%; identities between subgroup Ib are 30–40%. However, the identities are only 15% when the subgroup Ia and Ib members are compared (8Okamoto A. Kato R. Masui R. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Subgroup Ia AspATs have been more widely and extensively investigated (Ref. 10John R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar and references therein) than subgroup Ib AspATs and other aminotransferases with different substrate specificities. However, subgroup Ib AspATs from Sulfolobus solfataricus (11Marino G. Nitti G. Arnone M.I. Sannia G. Gambacorta A. De Rosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12305-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Bacillus sp. strain YM-2 (12Sung M.-H. Tanizawa K. Tanaka H. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Soda K. J.

(Tokyo). 1996; 119: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have been characterized physicochemically in vitro. T. thermophilus is an extremely thermophilic eubacterium that can grow at temperatures up to 85 °C (its optimum growth temperature is 75 °C) (13Oshima T. Imahori K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1974; 24: 102-112Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of T. thermophilus AspAT deduced from its gene (8Okamoto A. Kato R. Masui R. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem.

Walker J.M. Doonan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 810-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and 30–45% identities with subgroup Ib AspATs from S. solfataricus (15Cubellis M.V.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1919-1928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but only 15% sequence identifies with the subgroup Ia AspATs. Therefore, T. thermophilus AspAT is a member of the subgroup Ib AspATs. In common with other enzymes from thermophilic organisms, T. thermophilus AspAT is stable at temperatures up to 80 °C, and its high thermostability is thought to be related to its amino acid composition (8Okamoto A. Kato R. Masui R. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The high Pro content of T. thermophilus AspAT will make the enzyme rigid and thermostable, and its low content of heat-labile amino acid residues (Asn, Lys, and Cys) may prevent aging and irreversible inactivation. However, unlike T. thermophilus 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (18Yamada T. Akutsu N. Miyazaki K. Kakinuma K. Yoshida M. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the reactivity of T. thermophilus AspAT is nearly equal to those of AspATs from mesophilic organisms at the same room temperature (25 °C) (8Okamoto A. Kato R. Masui R. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Such enzymatic adaptation for a wide range of temperatures may generate interest for biotechnological applications. Studies on the three-dimensional structures of subgroup Ia AspATs fromEscherichia coli and vertebrates revealed that their spacial structures are essentially the same and demonstrated many functional residues (Tyr-70, Asn-194, Pro-195, Gly-197, Asp-222, Tyr-225, Lys-258, Arg-266, Arg-292, and Arg-386) 2The amino acid residues are numbered according to the sequence of pig cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (62Mehta P.K.

The residue that interacts directly with a distal carboxyl group of an acidic substrate, which is the Arg-292 residue in the subgroup Ia AspATs, has not been identified in the primary structure of subgroup Ib AspATs, which are, of course, highly active toward acidic substrates. Very recently, we succeeded in crystallizing T. thermophilusAspAT and determining the three-dimensional structure of its substrate-free form (Fig. 1 a, Protein Data Bank file 1BKG) (27Nakai, T., Okada, K., Kawaguchi, S., Kato, R., Kuramitsu, S., and Hirotsu, K. (1998) Acta Cryst. Sect. D, in pressGoogle Scholar). The structure of this enzyme led us to propose that Lys-109 is the residue that recognizes a distal carboxyl group of a dicarboxylic substrate because the distal amino group of the Lys-109 side chain is located near the position equivalent to that of Arg-292 in the structure of subgroup Ia AspATs complexed with an acidic substrate (Fig. 1 c), and this Lys residue is well conserved among subgroup Ib members (Fig. 2), whereas subgroup Ia AspATs have a Thr residue at this position (previously, we suggested that Arg-89 might recognize the distal carboxyl group of the substrate (8Okamoto A. Kato R. Masui R. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but Arg-89 is not conserved among subgroup Ib aminotransferases). Therefore, we constructed mutant enzymes of T. thermophilus AspAT by replacing Lys-109 with other residues and analyzed their substrate specificities to establish whether Lys-109 is a direct determinant of the acidic substrate specificity of subgroup Ib AspATs.Figure 2The amino acid sequence alignment of subgroup Ib aspartate aminotransferase in the region from the 50th to 110th residue.

However, replacement of Lys-109 of T. thermophilus AspAT with a neutral amino acid residue resulted in loss of activity toward acidic substrates but increased that toward hydrophobic substrates markedly. AnNdeI restriction site was created at the first ATG codon of the T. thermophilus aspC gene encoding AspAT in the plasmid pTG3 (8Okamoto A. Kato R. Masui R. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The 2.0-kilobase pair DNA fragment of NdeI-EcoRI, which contains the entire T. thermophilus aspC gene, was ligated to the plasmid pET3a (Novagen). The resulting plasmid, pAMA, was used to overproduceT. thermophilus AspAT. Mutations of the T. thermophilus aspC gene were produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-available site-directed mutagenesis, using the mixed primer with the sequence 5′-GAGGAGACCATCGTCACCGTGGGGGGG(G/A/T/C)(G/A/T/C)(G/C)CAAGCGCTCTTCAACCTCTTCCAGG-3′ and the primer with the sequence of 5′-GGTGGACTGGCTGGAGACGGAGGCCATGGC-3′ to construct the K109V and K109S mutants. The plasmid carrying the T. thermophilus aspCgene was denatured at 98 °C for 5 min in the PCR mixture without DNA polymerase, Taq DNA polymerase was added, and 30 PCR cycles of 1 min at 98 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C were performed. Each amplified fragment was subcloned into the pUC119 vector, and its DNA sequence was analyzed. No mutation was observed except for the designed mutation sites. The resultant DNA fragment carrying the mutant T. thermophilus aspC gene was cloned using PshAI and NcoI restriction sites into the pET3a expression vector, as described above for the wild-typeaspC gene. We searched for proteins with amino acid sequences similar to that of T. thermophilus AspAT in the non-redundant protein sequence data base using the BLASTP program, version 2.0.4 (31Altschul F.S.

The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring the plasmid pLysE was transformed with pAMA or a plasmid carrying a mutant aspC gene. The transformants were cultivated at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol; when the culture density reached 2 × 108 cells/ml, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the medium to produce a concentration of 50 μg/ml. After incubation for a further 5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −30 °C. T. thermophilus AspAT and the mutant enzymes were purified as described previously (8Okamoto A. Kato R. Masui R. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem.

The concentrations of the PLP and PMP forms of T. thermophilus AspAT and its mutant enzymes were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm and pH 8.0 using molar extinction coefficients (ε M) of 3.55 × 104 and 3.45 × 104 cm−1m−1, respectively (5Kuramitsu S.

(Tokyo). 1997; 122: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The overall transamination activity was measured using a coupled assay method with malate dehydrogenase and NADH (33Karmen A. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 131-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The half-transamination reactions of the PLP and PMP forms of the enzymes were followed at 380 and 330 nm, respectively, using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, SX-17MV) as described previously (5Kuramitsu S. Hiromi K. Hayashi H. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5469-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). All the reaction conditions used were 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, pH 8.0, and 25 °C. The kinetic parameters were determined using the following model and Equation 2,EL+S ⇌Kd E·S →kmax ES‡kapp=kmax[S]/(Kd+[S])(Eq. 2) where k app is the apparent rate constant at a given substrate concentration, k max is the maximum rate constant, and K d is the dissociation constant. For slow kinetic experiments, a HITACHI U-3000 spectrophotometer was employed. When the k app value was directly proportional to the substrate concentration, Equation 3, instead of Equation 2, was used to determine the catalytic efficiency,k max/K d (2Kiick D.M. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).kapp=(kmax/Kd)[S](Eq. 3) The aspartate analogs used were maleate and 2-methyl-dl-aspartate (2MeAsp). The maleate can bind noncovalently to the PLP form of AspAT, which increases the pK a of the internal aldimine between Nε of Lys-258 and C4′ of PLP (34Jenkins W.T. D'Ari L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5667-5674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Iwasaki M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem.

The K dvalues of these inhibitors were obtained by fitting the absorbance changes at 430 nm (36Kallen R.G. Korpela T. Martell A.E. Matsushima Y. Metzler C.M. Metzler D.E. Morozov Y.V. Ralston I.M.

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) was searched to find structures complexed with ligands bearing carboxyl groups. If the carboxyl group of a ligand found in the PDB file was not a component of the natural ligand for the protein, we excluded the mode of interaction between such a carboxyl group and protein from our analysis. For example, the structure of fumarase C, which utilizes dicarboxylate, complexed with citrate (tricarboxylate) has been solved, and two of the three carboxylate groups of citrate were proposed to be significant (37Weaver T. Banaszak L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13955-13965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, the two significant carboxylate groups were included in, but the other was excluded from, our analysis. Some PDB proteins contain only part of the functional unit, in which case the additional symmetry-related atoms were generated or found in its original reference to analyze the intersubunit interactions. The interactions between ligands and proteins have been analyzed using the HBPLUS program (38Laskowski R.A. Hutchinson E.G. Michie A.D. Wallace A.C. Jones M.L. Thornton J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 488-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) of McDonald and Thornton (39McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). The mutual homologies of the PDB proteins used in this study were evaluated using the FASTA program (40Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 85: 2444-2448Crossref Scopus (9380) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the PDB proteins rarely agreed with the expected values estimated by the FASTA program, and the homology values for this data set were less than 0.05, which meant that almost all entries of the proteins selected for this study were not homologous with each other. However, three pairs of related proteins ((i) muscular and intestinal fatty acid binding proteins, (ii) dipeptide and oligopeptide binding proteins, and (iii) class α and π glutathione S-transferases) were included in our analyses because they have different ligand interaction modes. The class μ and θ glutathione S-transferases were excluded because their interaction modes were similar to those of class π glutathione S-transferase. The mutant K109V and K109S T. thermophilus AspATs were constructed by replacing Lys-109 with Val and Ser, respectively, using PCR-based mutagenesis techniques. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the wild-type enzyme and mutant enzymes were almost identical in the far UV region (data not shown). Replacing of Lys-109 with Val increased the pK a value of the Schiff base formed between the amino group of Lys-258 and C4′ of PLP from 6.1 (8Okamoto A. Kato R. Masui R. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to 6.5. Similarly, the K109S mutation increased the pK a from 6.1 to 6.6. Such pK a shift has been reported by the replacement of the Arg residue in the substrate-binding site of subgroup Ia AspAT with another residue (41- 44), and replacement of Arg-292 with a hydrophobic residue, Val or Leu, increased the pK a value by 0.2 units (43Hayashi H. Kuramitsu S. Inoue Y. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results suggest the positive charge of Lys-109 was eliminated successfully from the active site of T. thermophilus AspAT without causing gross conformational changes.

The Azotobacter vinelandii strain expressing M156C is unable to grow under nitrogen-fixing conditions, and the purified protein cannot support substrate reduction in vitro. This mutation has an effect on the Fe protein's ability to undergo the MgATP-induced conformational change as evidenced by the fact that M156C is chelated in the presence of MgATP with a lower observed rate than wild-type. While the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of this protein are similar to those of the wild-type Fe protein, the circular dichroism spectrum is markedly different in the presence of MgATP, showing that the conformation adopted by M156C following nucleotide binding is different from the wild-type conformation. Although competition activity and chelation assays show that this Fe protein can still form a complex with the MoFe protein, this altered conformation only supports MgATP hydrolysis at 1% the rate of wild-type Fe protein. A model based on x-ray crystallographic information is presented to explain the importance of Met-156 in stabilization of the correct conformation of the Fe protein via critical interactions of the residue with Asp-43 and nucleotide in the other subunit.

The nitrogenase enzyme catalyzes the reduction of atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia and thus plays a critical role in the global nitrogen cycle. This enzyme is found in a large number of organisms, ranging from symbiotic and free-living bacteria to cyanobacteria, and has been extensively studied in the soil bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii (1Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar, 2Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2965-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). The nitrogenase enzyme consists of two oxygen-labile metalloproteins. The first is the molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein, a M r ∼240,000 α2β2 heterotetramer encoded by thenifD and nifK genes. This protein has been crystallographically characterized by itself (3Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) and in a complex with the second nitrogenase protein (4Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Additionally, the x-ray crystal structure of this protein from the obligate anaerobe Clostridium pasteurianum has also been solved (5Kim J. Woo D. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7104-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The resulting crystal structures have confirmed the existence of two different and interesting types of metal clusters. The first of these is called the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo cofactor). This cofactor is a [Mo-7Fe-9S-homocitrate] cluster (3Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 6Chan M.K. Kim J. Rees D.C. Science. 1993; 260: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) and is thought to be the site of substrate reduction (1Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). The second cluster is a [8Fe-7S] cluster called the P-cluster that appears to accept electrons as they are transferred to the MoFe protein (3Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 6Chan M.K. Kim J. Rees D.C. Science. 1993; 260: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 7Peters J.W. Stowell M.H.B. Soltis S.M. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The second protein in the nitrogenase enzyme is the iron (Fe) protein. This protein is a M r ∼60,000 α2homodimeric protein and is encoded by the nifH gene. It has also been crystallographically characterized by itself (8Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and in a complex with the MoFe protein (4Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). These crystal structures show that the Fe protein contains a single [4Fe-4S] cluster bound by two cysteinyl sulfurs from each identical subunit. The Fe protein is the only known reductant that is able to transfer electrons to the MoFe protein in such a way that the MoFe protein is then able to use them for substrate reduction. Each Fe protein subunit binds a single molecule of MgATP at a Walker A consensus sequence (9Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar, 10Robson R.L. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), approximately 19 Å from the [4Fe-4S] cluster (4Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 8Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). This binding event triggers a conformational change that is required for the formation of a productive complex with the MoFe protein (11Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21179-21186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conformational change is believed to be initiated by the breaking of a salt bridge between Lys-15 and Asp-125 by the MgATP γ-phosphate (13Wolle D. Dean D.R. Howard J.B. Science. 1992; 258: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Ryle M.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Mortenson L.E. Watt G.D. Seefeldt L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13112-13117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The subsequent movement of Asp-125 then communicates the nucleotide binding event to the [4Fe-4S] cluster through the movement of the polypeptide backbone connecting residue Asp-125 to the [4Fe-4S] cluster ligand Cys-132. This sequence of residues connecting Asp-125 to Cys-132 has been named switch II based on homology to other nucleotide binding proteins. While the residues in the Walker A sequence and the switch II sequence have been well characterized (11Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the proper function of these two regions of the protein is not the only requirement for the conformational change that occurs upon MgATP binding. We have previously identified a conserved region of the Fe protein that has been shown to play an important role in the protein's ability to undergo the proper MgATP-induced conformational change (12Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21179-21186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen L. Gavini N. Tsuruta H. Eliezer D. Burgess B.K. Doniach S. Hodgson K.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16927-16934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This region, which extends from residues 144 to 173, contains an α-helix designated helix α5 (4Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 8Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Changes made at Ala-157, near the subunit interface, dramatically affect the protein's ability to undergo the MgATP-induced conformational change. To better understand the role of this region in the MgATP-induced conformational change, a mutant Fe protein in which cysteine is introduced at the neighboring, completely conserved, Met-156 has been constructed, purified, and characterized. All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Fisher, Baxter Scientific, or Sigma unless otherwise noted. An A. vinelandii chromosomal fragment containing the nifH, nifD, and part of thenifK genes was cloned into the bacteriophage M13mp18. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Mutagene Mutagenesis Kit, version 2 from Bio-Rad. The mutagenesis oligonucleotide was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA. The oligonucleotide was 24 bases long, was complementary to the region surrounding the Met 156 codon, and was degenerate, allowing the production of several Fe protein mutants at position 156. Following the mutagenesis procedure, single strand DNA sequencing (Sequenase II, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was used to select bacteriophage that contained mutated nifH genes. Double-stranded DNA was isolated from these phage using a Qiagen kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and was used to transform two A. vinelandii strains, the wild-type Trans strain, and the ΔnifH strain DJ54 using a published method (20Page W.J. von Tigerstrom M. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 1058-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the chromosomal copy of the gene was replaced with the mutated gene through homologous recombination, allowing production of variant Fe protein in its native background, under the control of its native promoter. The recombination of the mutated nifH gene containing the Met to Cys mutation into the bacterial chromosome of the Trans strain resulted in a strain that was unable to grow under nitrogen-fixing conditions. All subsequent work was done on this Trans-derived strain. The M156C A. vinelandii strain was grown in 180-liter batches in a 250-liter New Brunswick fermenter in Burk minimal medium under ammonium acetate-limiting derepressing conditions. The medium was made 2 mm in ammonium acetate, such that the ammonia was exhausted during mid-log phase. Cultures were then derepressed for an additional 3 h and harvested using a flow-through centrifugal harvester (Cepa, Germany). The cell paste was washed with 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and was kept on dry ice until needed. The variant Fe protein was purified as described previously (21Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Steifel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) with some slight modifications. In particular, a heat step was not performed, and the gel filtration column was AcA34 (ICF, Cédex, France). The purified Fe protein was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its concentration was determined using the Biuret method (22Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For spectroscopic experiments, all samples were made in a Vacuum Atmospheres dry box under argon with less than 1 ppm oxygen. For EPR, the samples were 2 mm in Na2S2O4. The spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300 EZ spectrophotometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9002 liquid helium continuous flow cryostat. For CD experiments, the [4Fe-4S] cluster was oxidized by passage over a specially prepared column as described previously (23Ashby G.A. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem J. 1987; 246: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The column (1 × 10 cm) consists of, from top to bottom, 5 cm of indigo disulfonate dye (MC/B, Norwood, OH) bound to AG 1-X8 ion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) and 5-cm P6DG gel filtration resin (Bio-Rad). The protein was loaded onto the top of the column and was allowed to incubate longer than 15 min. It was then eluted with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter. Ultraviolet/visible spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8452/A diode array spectrophotometer. Enzyme activity was determined by measuring hydrogen evolution under an argon atmosphere or ethylene evolution under a 10% acetylene:90% argon atmosphere. Both assays were performed by incubating the Fe and MoFe proteins together in the presence of a reaction mixture (19Bursey E.H. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16927-16934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and 20 mm sodium dithionite. The proteins were incubated for 4 min in wild-type Fe protein assays and for 10 min for M156C Fe protein assays in calibrated stoppered vials. The calibrated vials containing 0.6 ml of the reaction mix and 0.3 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, were degassed followed by addition of 0.1 ml of 0.2 mNa2S2O4. The ratio of Fe protein to MoFe protein used was 0.5:1, and the total protein concentration was 0.5 mg. The reaction was initiated by the addition of Fe protein. Following incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was killed by the addition of 100 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid. The amount of H2 evolved was determined on a Varian 3700 gas chromatograph using a thermal conductivity detector. Ethylene evolution was measured on the same gas chromatograph using a flame ionization detector. The competition assay was performed as a standard H2 evolution assay with the specified amounts of wild-type MoFe and wild-type Fe protein added to each vial. Increasing amounts of either wild-type or M156C Fe protein were added to give the indicated ratios. The assays were incubated for 10 min and were killed with 100 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid. MgATP hydrolysis determination was performed in the same way as a standard H2 assay, but in the absence of a MgATP regenerating system. These 10-min assays were done at component ratios of 0.5:1 Fe:MoFe proteins with a total protein concentration of 0.2 and 1 mg/ml for the wild-type and M156C proteins, respectively, and were killed by the addition of 0.1 ml of 30% trichloroacetic acid. ADP concentrations were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography method (15Seefeldt L.C. Mortenson L.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Wehr C.T. Nucleic Acid Constituents by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Varian Associates Inc., Palo Alto, CA1980Google Scholar). An aliquot of the liquid from the killed activity assay was centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. The nucleotide concentration was then measured by loading it onto a Supelco LC-18-T C18 reverse-phase column and eluting with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. A Waters 486 tunable absorbance detector was used to detect the nucleotide by monitoring at 259 nm. An extinction coefficient of 15,400m−1 cm−1 at 259 nm was used to determine the concentration of nucleotide. The chelation assay followed published methods (11Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Walker G.A. Mortenson L.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Fe protein and α,α′-dipyridyl concentrations were 0.8 mg/ml and 6.25 mm, respectively. The reaction was carried out in stoppered quartz cuvettes containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 4 mmNa2S2O4 and was initiated by the addition of MgATP to a final concentration of 5 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. A double exponential curve was fit to the data following the method of Deits and Howard (26Deits T.L. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6619-6628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A subset of between 140 and 200 data points were extracted using a constant absorbance change from the chelation data over the entire course of the reaction. The equation Abst = P1exp(−k a t) + P2exp(−k b t) + Absinf was fitted to the data subset using the computer program Physica on a Linux workstation. In this equation, Abst is the observed absorbance at 520 nm at time t, P1 and P2 are pre-exponential terms, k a and k b are rate terms, and Absinf is the final absorbance at 520 nm and is allowed to vary during the fitting process. Met-156 is a completely conserved residue in the Fe protein of nitrogenase that is located at the base of helix α5 (4Schindelin H. Kisker C. Schlessman J.L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 8Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, in the absence of nucleotides, this residue protrudes into the interface between the two subunits of the Fe protein and is far removed from the [4Fe-4S] cluster. Here we have constructed a M156C variant Fe protein and expressed the protein in its native background in A. vinelandii. In contrast to the wild-type A. vinelandiistrain, this strain was unable to grow under N2-fixing conditions. The Fe protein has three defined roles in N2fixation: it is required for the initial biosynthesis of FeMo cofactor (27Filler W.A. Kemp R.M. Ng J.C. Hawkes T.R. Dixon R.A. Smith B.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Robinson A.C. Burgess B.K. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 180-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Robinson A.C. Dean D.R. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14327-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it is required for the insertion of preformed FeMo cofactor into FeMo cofactor-deficient MoFe proteins (30Robinson A.C. Chun T.W. Li J.G. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10088-10095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and it is the only protein that can serve as an electron donor to the MoFe protein in support of substrate reduction (1Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). The first two functions can be monitored by EPR spectroscopy, because the FeMo cofactor center of wild-type holo-MoFe protein exhibits a characteristic S = 3/2 EPR signal (31Palmer G. Multani J.S. Cretney W.C. Zumft W.G. Mortenson L.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that can easily be observed in cell-free extracts. The EPR spectra of crude extracts of the strain expressing M156C Fe protein clearly show that the M156C strain is able to participate both in the biosynthesis and insertion of the FeMo cofactor (data not shown), indicating that the defect must be in the electron transfer function of the M156C Fe protein. The M156C Fe protein was then purified anaerobically and, according to purification profiles and yields, was found to be present in approximately wild-type levels. When added to a standard nitrogenase assay for hydrogen evolution the wild-type Fe protein supported a rate of hydrogen evolution of 2224 nmol·min−1·mg Fe protein−1, but the M156C Fe protein was unable to support detectable levels of hydrogen evolution. Likewise, while the wild-type Fe protein supported acetylene reduction at a rate of 1612 nmol·min−1·mg Fe protein−1, the M156C Fe protein activity was undetectable. These data confirm that the Nif− phenotype of the strain expressing M156C Fe protein is due to a defect in its electron transfer function. In the first step of a normal nitrogenase reaction the Fe protein binds two molecules of MgATP and undergoes a conformational change that is critical for the next step in the reaction, productive binding to the MoFe protein (11Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21179-21186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One method that has been used extensively to characterize the MgATP-induced conformational change is iron chelation by compounds such as α,α′-dipyridyl (25Walker G.A. Mortenson L.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Deits T.L. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6619-6628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of MgADP, the wild-type Fe protein's [4Fe-4S]+ cluster is almost entirely protected from chelation by α,α′-dipyridyl. This is also true for the M156C Fe protein (data not shown). Upon addition of MgATP, the reactivity of the chelator for the iron in the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the wild-type Fe protein is greatly increased, such that the iron is entirely removed from the Fe protein's cluster (26Deits T.L. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6619-6628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 compares the behavior of the wild-type and M156C Fe proteins in a standard nitrogenase chelation assay. Clearly both proteins are able to bind MgATP and undergo a conformational change that makes the Fe atoms of the cluster accessible to the chelating reagent. This chelation reaction has complex biphasic kinetics (26Deits T.L. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6619-6628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was therefore analyzed by fitting a double exponential curve to the data as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data from four experiments provided average wild-type values for k a and k b of 6.3 × 10−2 ± 4.1 × 10−3 s−1 and 9.7 × 10−3± 4.5 × 10−4 s−1, respectively. In contrast to this, the values associated with the M156C Fe protein were lower, 4.9 × 10−2 ± 4.1 × 10−3s−1 (78% wild-type) and 5.2 × 10−3 ± 6.1 × 10−5 s−1 (54% wild-type) fork a and k b, respectively. These decreased rates could be caused by a slower conformational change or by the protein ending up in a different conformation with the Fe atoms less accessible to the chelator, or both. We then proceeded to examine the M156C Fe protein using spectroscopic methods to determine whether it adopts the correct conformation upon MgATP binding or whether it adopts another conformation. EPR spectroscopy can be used to characterize the Fe protein in the [4Fe-4S]+ oxidation state (31Palmer G. Multani J.S. Cretney W.C. Zumft W.G. Mortenson L.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the change that occurs upon MgATP binding by monitoring the characteristic S = 1/2 signal that changes from rhombic in the nucleotide-free conformation to axial in the MgATP-bound conformation (32Zumft W.G. Palmer G. Mortenson L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The spectra of the wild-type and M156C Fe proteins in the presence of 2 mmNa2S2O4 and in the absence and presence of MgATP are indistinguishable from each other (data not shown). These data suggest that the M156C Fe protein has a similar conformation to that of the wild-type Fe protein in the absence of nucleotide and that it undergoes a similar conformational change upon MgATP binding. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in the visible region can be used to examine the environment of [Fe-S] clusters in proteins. For the Fe protein, weak but measurable CD is observed for the [4Fe-4S]2+ oxidation state of the protein that changes upon binding of either MgATP or MgADP (33Stephens P.J. McKenna C.E. Smith B.E. Nguyen H.T. McKenna M.-C. Thomson A.J. Devlin F. Jones J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2585-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34Ryle M.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Scarrow R.C. Jensen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1551-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). MgADP binding is known to induce a less dramatic conformational change in the Fe protein than does MgATP (1Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar, 18Chen L. Gavini N. Tsuruta H. Eliezer D. Burgess B.K. Doniach S. Hodgson K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3290-3294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the CD spectra of both the wild-type and M156C Fe proteins in the absence of nucleotide (top panel), in the presence of MgADP (middle panel), and in the presence of MgATP (bottom panel). The line shape of the wild-type and M156C Fe protein spectra is similar in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of MgADP, suggesting that their conformations are very similar. In sharp contrast, the spectrum of the wild-type Fe protein in the presence of MgATP is strikingly different from that of the M156C Fe protein in the presence of MgATP. Thus, in the region of the [4Fe-4S]2+cluster, the conformation of the M156C Fe protein is somehow different from that of the wild-type protein. We have considered the possibility that the differences observed in the EPR and CD spectra are entirely dependent on the redox state of the protein. If this were the case, we would conclude, based on the spectroscopic evidence, that the M156C Fe protein adopts the normal conformation in the [4Fe-4S]+ state, but adopts an abnormal conformation when oxidized to the [4Fe-4S]2+state. However, our experimental results suggest that this is not the case. Our chelation experiments, in which the Fe protein is in the [4Fe-4S]+ state, indicate that the M156C Fe protein adopts a conformation similar enough to the wild-type protein's conformation to allow iron chelation, but different enough to affect the observed rates of chelation. These different rates suggest an altered structure around the [4Fe-4S] cluster. As discussed below, the ability of the reduced M156C Fe protein to form a complex with the MoFe protein suggests a conformation that is similar overall to the wild-type protein, while the variant's inability to support MgATP hydrolysis and substrate reduction suggests conformational differences. These results, all of which are obtained from reduced Fe proteins, combined with the CD results indicate that the structure of the M156C Fe protein in either oxidation state is similar to, but not identical with, the wild-type structure. Taken together the above data show that the M156C Fe protein binds MgATP and undergoes a conformational change but that the final product is somehow different in the region of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The next step in nitrogenase turnover for the wild-type protein is the formation of a complex between the Fe protein and the MoFe protein. We examined the interactions between these proteins using two techniques. The first technique is a modification of the standard chelation experiment in which MoFe protein is included in the cuvette. It has been known for some time that inclusion of MoFe protein in a Fe protein chelation assay decreases the observed rate of chelation (25Walker G.A. Mortenson L.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Examination of the recently published Fe protein·MoFe protein complex crystal structure provides an explanation for this result by showing that the [4Fe-4S] cluster is covered up by the surface of the MoFe protein when the two proteins are in a complex. This prevents the chelator from gaining access to the [4Fe-4S] cluster, thus inhibiting chelation. Fig. 4 shows the results of a chelation experiment performed in the presence of the MoFe protein. It is immediately obvious that this mutant Fe protein does receive protection from chelation in the presence of the MoFe protein. Thus, by this criterion, the two proteins are able to form a complex. The second technique we used was designed to answer the question: can the inactive M156C Fe protein compete with wild-type Fe protein in an activity assay? Fig. 5 shows the results of an experiment in which increasing amounts of either wild-type or M156C Fe protein were added to an activity assay with a fixed amount of wild-type Fe protein present. If the M156C Fe protein could not form a complex with the MoFe protein then the activity would not be affected by its presence. In contrast, Fig. 5 shows that the M156C Fe protein is able to compete effectively with the wild-type Fe protein in an activity assay, confirming the result obtained from the chelation protection assay. Because it has been known for several years that the MgATP conformation of the Fe protein is a prerequisite for formation of a productive complex (11Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. D"

Species-specific cell recognition in sponges is mediated by proteoglycan-like extracellular complexes termed aggregation factors (AFs),1 unidentified so far in other phyla, although Northern blots suggested the existence, in several human tissues, of proteins related to those found in the AF of the marine sponge Microciona prolifera (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion in this species is mediated by calcium-dependent carbohydrate interactions of homologous Microciona AF (MAF) molecules viaN-linked glycans. A proposed model suggested that species specificity could be at least partially provided by the different spacing of glycosaminoglycan chains on the protein core (2Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus postulating the existence of a different AF core protein in each species. Unexpectedly, an extraordinarily high intraspecific variability was found for the MAF core protein (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that AFs might also be involved in individual specificity.The immune and cell adhesion systems are clearly related, as deduced from phylogenetic relationships between molecules of both groups (3Matsunaga T. Mori N. Scand. J. Immunol. 1987; 25: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and as expected from the fact that the cells of the immune system depend on regulated interactions with other cells to be activated (4Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5829) Google Scholar). An evolutionary connection between cell adhesion and histocompatibility, however, has yet to be demonstrated. Presumably, it was around the time when metazoans appeared that the primitive machinery regulating cell interactions had to evolve and diversify into the whole array of molecules that allowed the far more complex structures leading to multicellularity first and then to tissues and organs. A second possibility is that the cell adhesion system of higher animals appeared de novo, and therefore, vertebrate and invertebrate histocompatibility would be the result of convergent evolution rather than of a common ancestry. The finding, in an ever increasing number of invertebrates including sponges, of Ig-like domains (5Schäcke H. Rinkevich B. Gamulin V. Müller I.M. Müller W.E. J. Mol. Recognit. 1994; 7: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Pancer Z. Kruse M. Schäcke H. Scheffer U. Steffen R. Kovács P. Müller W.E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and of extracellular matrix components common to all pluricellular animals (7Morris P.J. Evolution. 1993; 47: 152-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the latter view is less likely.A surprising characteristic of sponges, considering their phylogenetic position as the most primitive extant metazoans, is that they possess a highly evolved histocompatibility system. When tissues from different individuals of a given sponge species are brought into contact, they either fuse or reject through cellular events similar to those observed in vertebrate grafts, which include (i) an inflammation-like massive migration of certain cell types toward the region of contact (8Humphreys T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 712: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), (ii) phagocytosis and/or cytotoxic reactions (9Van de Vyver G. Barbieux B. J. Exp. Zool. 1983; 227: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10Yin C. Humphreys T. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1996; 191: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and (iii) the layering of a collagen barrier separating the apposed tissues (8Humphreys T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 712: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Any grafting between two genetically different sponge individuals is almost invariably incompatible in the many species investigated (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Van de Vyver G. Barbieux B. J. Exp.

Schmahl G.P. Science. 1984; 224: 413-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), exhibiting a variety of transitive qualitatively and quantitatively different responses, which can only be explained by the existence of an extensive genetic polymorphism at the locus or loci controlling graft acceptance and rejection. In the protochordateBotryllus schlosseri, contact between two genetically distinct individuals leads to the resorption of one of them by the other through a phenomenon that is controlled by highly polymorphic loci (13Rinkevich B. Saito Y. Weissman I.L. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1993; 184: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The frequency of resorption in Botryllus is comparable to that of rejection in sponges, suggesting that both might be analogous manifestations of a sophisticated histocompatibility system in invertebrates that would have been an ideal building block for the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex. And yet, despite the relevant cytological and genetic studies outlined above, there is an absolute lack of sequence and evolutionary data concerning invertebrate molecules involved in allorecognition.Individual variability of sequences related to the main protein of MAF (MAFp3) matched the elevated sponge alloincompatibility (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although from Southern blot results, it could not be established whether such variability resided in the AF proteins themselves or if it also represented sequence-related molecules not belonging to the AF. MAFp3 and another protein suspected to belong to the AF seemed to be translated together as a longer polypeptide from the same mRNA (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,14Fernàndez-Busquets X. Kammerer R.A. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23558-23565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we characterize this new component and start studying the significance of the variability in MAFp3. We also present the first attempts to study what role, if any, AFs might play in sponge histocompatibility.DISCUSSIONThe correlation between the variability of MAF proteins as deduced from restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and the allogeneic behavior within a sponge population supports a possible involvement of the cell adhesion system in sponge histocompatibility reactions (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The accumulation in grafts of the mRNA coding for the protein core of the main adhesion molecule of the sponge adds to this hypothesis. The phenomena occurring in M. proliferagrafts can be first identified under the microscope ∼1 h after grafting, when the pinacoderm begins to be disrupted in both rejecting and accepting grafts (data not shown). It is also at this moment when MAFp3/MAFp4 mRNA starts to accumulate. The function of MAF in tissue grafts is at present obscure, although the increased transcription of its mRNA under adverse conditions such as necrosis in nearby tissue suggests some role in defense processes. The observations that a cell function such as transcription is so homogeneous in areas of the animal separated by >10 cm and that it can change dramatically in a time scale of hours indicate that sponges, despite lacking circulatory and nervous systems, must have an efficient way to quickly exchange information between cells separated by large distances.In different individuals, the polymorphic MAFp3 forms were isolated in variable amounts relative to each other (see 51- and 49-kDa bands in individuals 1–3; Fig. 5, a and b), an unexpected result if all the cells of the species were always producing the same type of MAF. This result could indicate that the production of a given MAFp3 type depends on particular physiological states of the sponge, and therefore, certain MAFp3 forms would be preferentially present at different times of the life cycle. An alternative explanation suggests that different types of cells within the same individual produce different types of MAF, and therefore, different dosages of cell types in each preparation would explain the fluctuations in the relative amounts of MAFp3 forms. Atomic force microscope studies have shown that Block 2 binds, with very different affinities, individual AF molecules that were purified from a single sponge (32Fritz J. Anselmetti D. Jarchow J. Fernàndez-Busquets X. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and this is in agreement with the assumption that different types of AF molecules exist that exhibit distinct specific activities. Peptides containing sequences exclusive of MAFp3D or MAFp4D have never been found in the many AF preparations analyzed. The presence in sponge cell membranes of a 68-kDa protein related to the core protein of a highly glycan-substituted component of the extracellular AF would substantiate the hypothesis of the existence of proteins phylogenetically related to those in the AF, but that might have a function other than promoting species-specific cell adhesion. The appearance in allogeneic grafts of a cell layer turned on to express an epitope recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against MAFp3 could represent the tissue distribution of the elusive 68-kDa protein. The absence of colocalization with monoclonal antibodies against MAF glycans suggests that the protein being detected does not belong to MAF and might be expressed only under particular physiological conditions such as allogeneic contact.Mixtures of cells dissociated from different individuals of the freshwater sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis segregated into clumps containing cells of only one individual several days after a mixed aggregate was formed (33Van de Vyver G. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1975; 10: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such individual specificity could be also observed between cell fractions containing only one cell type (34De Sutter D. Van de Vyver G. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1979; 3: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Different sponge cell types also show selective reaggregation and different adhesive properties (35Leith A. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1979; 156: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, dissociated sponge cells exhibit species-, individual-, and cell-type specificities in their reaggregation properties. In rejection studies done by graftingin situ a population of the marine spongeHymeniacidon sp., “interaction modulation factors” were purified from each individual, and measurements of their adhesion efficiency were made on cells of all the sponges among which grafting had been done (36Curtis A.S.G. Larwood G. Rosen B.R. Biology and Systematics of Colonial Organisms. Academic Press Ltd., London1979: 39-47Google Scholar). While the adhesiveness of those cells treated with a factor preparation made from the same sponge or from another strain whose grafts were accepted was always appreciable, factor from those strains that were not graft-compatible with the strain type of the cells led to a very considerable decrease in cell adhesion. The procedure described to prepare the interaction modulation factors was equivalent to the method used to extract MAF, suggesting that both molecules are analogous. If, then, AFs were directly involved in allorecognition, would they have any structural features resembling histocompatibility molecules of higher animals?The reiterated domain found in MAFp4 has several features that vaguely recall Ig-like domains. It remains a consensus that, to be included in the Ig superfamily, a molecule has to fulfill certain criteria (37Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Although the first condition sine qua non is the presence of a domain-sized sequence with significant similarity to Ig-related domains, there should also be the probability that the sequence shares key structural characteristics of the Ig fold. Although an adequate statistical test like the Dayhoff scoring matrix (38Dayhoff M.O. Barker W.C. Hunt L.T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 524-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) is widely available to evaluate sequence homologies, structural proof for an Ig-related domain can only be convincingly established by tertiary structure determination. Ig chains are thought to have evolved from a primordial gene coding for ∼100 amino acids, with a characteristic intrachain disulfide bond. Preceding this, there may have been a half-domain structure, as suggested by the existence of genes that have introns in the sequence between the conserved cysteines. Genes with the intradomain introns might therefore be more directly derived from ancient ancestor genes. The disulfide bond of the Ig fold stabilizes two β-sheets that consist of anti-parallel β-strands containing 5–10 amino acids. Last, but not least, Ig-related molecules diverge very rapidly, as indicated by the percentage of identity between species. For instance, the variable-like domain of CD8 chain I is only 42% identical between rodents and humans.The positions of introns in the carboxyl-proximal region of MAFp4 were determined in our previous work (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The introns are placed in the boundaries between domains and, interestingly, in the middle of the domains (Fig. 7). The reiterated motifs in MAFp4 are not classical Ig-like domains, but the short β-strand-forming regions in the MAFp4 repeats (Fig. 7) could evolve toward the β-barrel of the most classical Ig folds with just a few mutations, easily achievable during the period of time between the appearance of sponges 600 million years ago and the earliest occurrence of a typical Ig domain, identified by sequence analysis in the insect proteins fasciclin II (39Harrelson A.L. Goodman C.S. Science. 1988; 242: 700-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and amalgam (40Seeger M.A. Haffley L. Kaufman T.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 589-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). An evolutionary connection, however, is difficult to prove with only the basis of protein sequence comparison due to the enormous variability of the molecules belonging to the Ig superfamily. Considerable variation in sequence length of typical Ig domains occurs between the conserved disulfide bond, ranging from 40 to 75 amino acids. Often, β-sheets contain β-breaking residues like a proline in β-strand D of several C1 set sequences (37Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Some Ig folds like those in the T cell adhesion molecules CD2 and LFA-3 even lack the disulfide bond. Finally, despite that most of the superfamily consists of membrane-bound members, non-cell surface molecules like α1B-glycoprotein and the basement membrane link protein are also included. Based on simple alignment programs, polymorphic Ig-like featuring genes have been described in the marine sponge Geodia cydonium (41Pancer Z. Skorokhod A. Blumbach B. Müller W.E. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that the evolutionary origin of the Ig fold might have to be pushed back to the lowest contemporary invertebrate phylum, if not beyond. Alternatively, the Ig system may have arisen independently, and the similarity of the Ig domain may be the result of convergent evolution imposed by its functional properties.The similarities in the domain structure and sequence between the sponge adhesion protein MAFp4 and a bacterial endoglucanase reinforce the hypothesis that the reiterated domains might be involved in the binding of other proteins and in the attachment of the endoglucanase to the bacterial surface (29Geelen D. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3304-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such modular nature is a common feature of many cell adhesion proteins (42Lipke P.N. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1996; 17: 119-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). MAFp3, on the other hand, does not have significant similarities either to the A. caulinodansendoglucanase or to any other protein or translated DNA sequences in data bases. In our previous work, however, we reported the existence of human nucleic acids hybridizing with MAFp3-specific probes on Southern and Northern blots (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As a rule, DNA regions can be identified by annealing if the nucleotide sequences are <30% different (38Dayhoff M.O. Barker W.C. Hunt L.T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 524-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that still unknown proteins that are highly homologous to MAFp3 exist in higher vertebrates.Although the role of AFs in species specificity has been clearly established, we propose here that also individual specificity might be based on AF-related molecules or even on the AF itself. This scenario suggests that modern histocompatibility systems might have evolved from primitive cell adhesion molecules, a hypothesis supported by the occurrence of putative ancestors of typical Ig domains in MAFp4, a protein involved in sponge cell adhesion. If, on the other hand, the histocompatibility system of sponges developed after their split from the vertebrate evolutionary line, it would represent a fascinating alternative to allorecognition strategies. Species-specific cell recognition in sponges is mediated by proteoglycan-like extracellular complexes termed aggregation factors (AFs),1 unidentified so far in other phyla, although Northern blots suggested the existence, in several human tissues, of proteins related to those found in the AF of the marine sponge Microciona prolifera (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion in this species is mediated by calcium-dependent carbohydrate interactions of homologous Microciona AF (MAF) molecules viaN-linked glycans. A proposed model suggested that species specificity could be at least partially provided by the different spacing of glycosaminoglycan chains on the protein core (2Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus postulating the existence of a different AF core protein in each species. Unexpectedly, an extraordinarily high intraspecific variability was found for the MAF core protein (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that AFs might also be involved in individual specificity. The immune and cell adhesion systems are clearly related, as deduced from phylogenetic relationships between molecules of both groups (3Matsunaga T. Mori N. Scand. J. Immunol. 1987; 25: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and as expected from the fact that the cells of the immune system depend on regulated interactions with other cells to be activated (4Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5829) Google Scholar). An evolutionary connection between cell adhesion and histocompatibility, however, has yet to be demonstrated. Presumably, it was around the time when metazoans appeared that the primitive machinery regulating cell interactions had to evolve and diversify into the whole array of molecules that allowed the far more complex structures leading to multicellularity first and then to tissues and organs. A second possibility is that the cell adhesion system of higher animals appeared de novo, and therefore, vertebrate and invertebrate histocompatibility would be the result of convergent evolution rather than of a common ancestry. The finding, in an ever increasing number of invertebrates including sponges, of Ig-like domains (5Schäcke H. Rinkevich B. Gamulin V. Müller I.M. Müller W.E. J. Mol. Recognit. 1994; 7: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Pancer Z. Kruse M. Schäcke H. Scheffer U. Steffen R. Kovács P. Müller W.E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and of extracellular matrix components common to all pluricellular animals (7Morris P.J. Evolution. 1993; 47: 152-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the latter view is less likely. A surprising characteristic of sponges, considering their phylogenetic position as the most primitive extant metazoans, is that they possess a highly evolved histocompatibility system. When tissues from different individuals of a given sponge species are brought into contact, they either fuse or reject through cellular events similar to those observed in vertebrate grafts, which include (i) an inflammation-like massive migration of certain cell types toward the region of contact (8Humphreys T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 712: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), (ii) phagocytosis and/or cytotoxic reactions (9Van de Vyver G. Barbieux B. J. Exp. Zool. 1983; 227: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10Yin C. Humphreys T. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1996; 191: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and (iii) the layering of a collagen barrier separating the apposed tissues (8Humphreys T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 712: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Any grafting between two genetically different sponge individuals is almost invariably incompatible in the many species investigated (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Van de Vyver G. Barbieux B. J. Exp.

Schmahl G.P. Science. 1984; 224: 413-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), exhibiting a variety of transitive qualitatively and quantitatively different responses, which can only be explained by the existence of an extensive genetic polymorphism at the locus or loci controlling graft acceptance and rejection. In the protochordateBotryllus schlosseri, contact between two genetically distinct individuals leads to the resorption of one of them by the other through a phenomenon that is controlled by highly polymorphic loci (13Rinkevich B. Saito Y. Weissman I.L. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1993; 184: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The frequency of resorption in Botryllus is comparable to that of rejection in sponges, suggesting that both might be analogous manifestations of a sophisticated histocompatibility system in invertebrates that would have been an ideal building block for the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex. And yet, despite the relevant cytological and genetic studies outlined above, there is an absolute lack of sequence and evolutionary data concerning invertebrate molecules involved in allorecognition. Individual variability of sequences related to the main protein of MAF (MAFp3) matched the elevated sponge alloincompatibility (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although from Southern blot results, it could not be established whether such variability resided in the AF proteins themselves or if it also represented sequence-related molecules not belonging to the AF. MAFp3 and another protein suspected to belong to the AF seemed to be translated together as a longer polypeptide from the same mRNA (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,14Fernàndez-Busquets X. Kammerer R.A. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23558-23565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we characterize this new component and start studying the significance of the variability in MAFp3. We also present the first attempts to study what role, if any, AFs might play in sponge histocompatibility. DISCUSSIONThe correlation between the variability of MAF proteins as deduced from restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and the allogeneic behavior within a sponge population supports a possible involvement of the cell adhesion system in sponge histocompatibility reactions (1Fernàndez-Busquets X. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27839-27847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The accumulation in grafts of the mRNA coding for the protein core of the main adhesion molecule of the sponge adds to this hypothesis. The phenomena occurring in M. proliferagrafts can be first identified under the microscope ∼1 h after grafting, when the pinacoderm begins to be disrupted in both rejecting and accepting grafts (data not shown). It is also at this moment when MAFp3/MAFp4 mRNA starts to accumulate. The function of MAF in tissue grafts is at present obscure, althoug"

The negatively stained crystalline areas displayed unit cell dimensions a = 26.6 nm, b = 27.7 nm, and γ = 90o, and p22121 plane group symmetry consisting of two monomers facing upward and two monomers facing downward with respect to the membrane plane. Higher plant PSI shows several structural similarities to the cyanobacterial PSI complex, with a prominent ridge on the stromal side of the complex. The stromal ridge is resolved into at least three separate domains that are interpreted as representing the three well characterized stromal subunits, the psa C, D, and E gene products. The lumenal surface is relatively flat but exhibits a distinct central depression that may be the binding site for plastocyanin. Higher plant PSI is of dimensions 15–16 × 11–12.5 nm, and thus leaves a larger footprint in the membrane than its cyanobacterial equivalent (13 × 10.5 nm). It is expected that additional membrane-bound polypeptides will be present in the higher plant PSI.

This report represents the first three-dimensional structure for the higher plant PSI complex. photosystem light harvesting complex chlorophyll 2-(morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid root mean square. Photosystem (PS)1 I is a multiprotein complex found in the photosynthetic membranes of plants and cyanobacteria. It carries out the second light-driven electron transfer step in the linear Z scheme of photosynthesis (1Bryant D.A. Barber J. Current Topics in Photosynthesis. 11. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 1-27Google Scholar). In higher plants, a significant proportion of the PSI complexes is located in the stromal lamellae (2Andersson B. Anderson J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 593: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Cyclic electron transfer may be carried out by this pool of PSI for at least part of the time. It is also thought that higher plant PSI complexes may be located around the periphery of the grana stacks (the grana margins) where they interact with photosystem II (PSII) complexes, and probably take part in linear electron transfer (2Andersson B. Anderson J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 593: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). On the basis of spectroscopic data, it has been proposed that there is heterogeneity in the structure of higher plant PSI (3Andreasson E. Albertsson P.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 175-182Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with stromally located PSI complexes predicted to have a smaller photosynthetic unit size (i.e. a reduced number of light-harvesting pigments) than their granally located sisters. Until now, there has been little direct structural investigation of higher plant PSI. The paucity of structural data was largely due to the lack of two- or three-dimensional crystals of the higher plant complex. In the absence of crystals, the analysis of freeze-fractured or freeze-etched thylakoid membranes by shadowing and electron microscopy was carried out (e.g. see Dunahay and Staehelin (4Dunahay Y. Staehelin L.A. Plant Physiol. 1985; 78: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but only the overall dimensions of the complexes were determined, and uncertainty over their identification as PSI was not eliminated. In a second approach, higher plant PSI complexes have been purified after detergent solubilization and then examined by electron microscopy after negative staining (5Boekema E.J. Wynn R.M. Malkin R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 49-56Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These studies estimated the dimensions of the various PSI subcomplexes and described their general shape (approximately elliptical). Without correction for attached detergent, average dimensions for three types of monomeric PSI complexes were found to be approximately 15.3 × 10.5 nm, 16.2 × 11.1 nm, and 20.0 × 16.0 nm. Each of the three types of PSI particle were representative of different preparation methods yielding complexes with different polypeptide and pigment compositions. Structural studies on two-dimensional crystals of higher plant PSI obtained in spinach thylakoid membranes were recently reported (6Kitmitto A Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19497-19501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These represented the first reported two-dimensional crystals of the higher plant complex. It has been demonstrated that the crystals are well ordered, and they have been used to generate a projection map of the higher plant PSI complex in negative stain at about 2.5-nm resolution. This revealed the overall shape of the complex. Further structural details, such as the high density domain (“ridge”) predicted to contain the extrinsic polypeptides on the stromal side of the complex, were suggested by the projection structure. These earlier studies were also consistent with the hypothesis that a population of PSI complexes exists around the periphery of the grana stacks in the thylakoids (6Kitmitto A Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19497-19501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Wollenberger P.A. Stefansson H., Yu, S.G. Albertsson P-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 93-102Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast to the higher plant situation, structural studies of the more robust cyanobacterial PSI complex are well advanced. Both two- and three-dimensional crystals of the cyanobacterial complex have been available for the last 10 years (8Ford R.C. Hefti A. Engel A.

Engel A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Bottcher B. Graber P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), as well as a major x-ray crystallography effort, which has now resolved cyanobacterial PSI structure to a level where the assignment of secondary structure, chlorophyll molecules, and electron transfer components has become possible (14Krauss N. Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Stuct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 15Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The latest x-ray data shows that the cyanobacterial PSI complex contains at least 31 transmembrane α helices and 86–100 chlorophyll (Chl) amolecules (15Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). 2N. Krauss, personal communication.2N. Krauss, personal communication. The cyanobacterial PSI complex contains 11 polypeptides, but the two largest polypeptides, of mass roughly 80 kDa each, bind the majority of the electron transfer components and pigment molecules. The central core of the PSI complex appears to be similar in construction to the basic purple bacterial reaction center, with 2 × 5 transmembrane α helices related by an axis of 2-fold rotational pseudosymmetry. In the crystals, the PSI is found as a trimeric complex, which is readily isolated after detergent solubilization of cyanobacterial membranes (8Ford R.C. Hefti A. Engel A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although these trimeric complexes have been observed in reconstituted proteoliposomes at high protein:lipid ratios and under high salt conditions (8Ford R.C. Hefti A. Engel A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), they have so far not been convincingly detected in native cyanobacterial membranes, where only monomeric particles have been observed (11Hefti A. Ford R.C. Miller M. Cox R.P. Engel A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to date. It therefore remains a strong possibility that, like the higher plant situation, cyanobacterial PSI is normally monomeric in vivo, and that unlike the higher plant equivalent, it oligomerises in vitroupon detergent solubilization of the membranes. A subunit present in both the cyanobacterial PSI and higher plant PSI (the psa Lgene product) has been implicated in the oligomerization of the cyanobacterial complex into trimers (16Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and has therefore been assigned to a position at the center of the trimeric complex (14Krauss N. Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Stuct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 15Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar,17Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The location of this protein in the higher plant PSI complex will thus be of particular interest since oligomerization of the higher plant complex does not appear to occur. The light-harvesting system of higher plant PSI consists of an evolutionarily conserved, core light-harvesting system containing about 100 Chl a molecules that can possibly be modeled on the cyanobacterial PSI complex. However in higher plants, but not in cyanobacteria, this core is surrounded by several evolutionarily divergent peripheral light-harvesting proteins (LHCI proteins) which bind an additional 100–150 Chl a and b pigments. The size of this peripheral antenna is controlled by environmental factors, such as the intensity and spectral composition of the incident light energy and may also be modulated by the location of the PSI complex in the thylakoid membrane (3Andreasson E. Albertsson P.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 175-182Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, it is thought that higher plant PSI can associate with phosphorylated LHCII polypeptides migrating from PSII in a reversible manner, in a process that is under redox control (2Andersson B. Anderson J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 593: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). At least four different LHCI polypeptides have been identified (22–25 kDa), present in about eight copies per PSI complex (17Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), thus forming a sizeable proportion (∼50%) of the total mass of the higher plant PSI complex. In addition to the LHCI polypeptides (which are completely absent in cyanobacteria), higher plant PSI contains other polypeptides not found in the cyanobacterial PSI preparations. These include the products of the psa G and H genes as well as the psa N gene product. All three polypeptides are small, in the region of 9–11 kDa, and one of these (the psa H gene product) seems to be an extrinsic protein. Higher plants apparently lack only one of the cyanobacterial PSI proteins, the psa M product (∼4 kDa). The significance of the differences in polypeptide composition between plants and cyanobacteria is not well understood; indeed the roles of most of the PSI subunits in either plants or cyanobacterial are still unknown (17Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). There may even be different roles for the same polypeptide. For example, the psa F gene product in plants appears to have a role in binding the soluble electron donor protein plastocyanin on the lumenal side of the complex (31Max-Wynn R. Malkin R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5863-5869Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, this function for psa F has not been found in cyanobacteria. Given the wealth of structural detail available for the cyanobacterial PSI complex, a three-dimensional structural study of the higher plant version can be considered to be long overdue. The use of rapid in situ two-dimensional crystallization combined with electron crystallography has now allowed an alternative approach to be developed. It is now possible to judge the degree to which the cyanobacterial structure is applicable to the plant PSI complex and we can begin to explore the extent of the structural evolution of the higher plant complex that has given rise to its unique light-harvesting system and environment in the thylakoid membrane. In this article, we present the three-dimensional structure of the higher plant complex and discuss its relationship to the cyanobacterial PSI reaction center complex. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) PSII-enriched grana membranes (BBYs) were prepared as described previously (6Kitmitto A Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19497-19501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentrations were determined as described by Arnon (19Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystal containing PSII-enriched grana membranes were prepared by a two-step incubation procedure. Thylakoid membranes were left to stack in the dark for 2 h; the chlorophyll concentration adjusted to 2 mg ml−1 and Triton X-100 added for a detergent to chlorophyll ratio of 13.75:1 (w/w) and incubated in the dark for 20 min at room temperature (20 °C). The sample was then centrifuged (4 °C) at 13,000 × g (Eppendorf centrifuge 5415C) for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm MES/NaOH (pH 6.3), 5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaCl) at 4 °C. Chlorophyll concentrations were then adjusted to 2 mg ml−1 for a second incubation step (20 °C) with a detergent to chlorophyll ratio of 5:1 (w/w) in the dark for 20 min. The sample was then centrifuged (4 °C) at 13,000 × gfor 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in cold Buffer A (4 °C). An aliquot was taken and diluted to a suitable concentration (20–30 μg Chl ml −1) for electron microscopic studies. Membrane preparations were assayed for PSI content by measuring the chlorophylla:b ratio and the extent of P700 oxidation as described previously (6Kitmitto A Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19497-19501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Samples were negatively stained as described before (6Kitmitto A Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19497-19501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and examined in a Philips 400 or CM10 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 keV (18Stoylova S. McPhie P. Flint T.D. Ford R.C. Holzenburg A. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publ., Dordrecht1996: 333-336Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were recorded at calibrated magnifications (of × 27,500 and × 38,450) on Kodak electron microscope film (ESTAR Thick Base 4489) and digitized for a pixel size of 0.78 or 0.74 nm at the specimen level. The digitized images of tilted crystalline areas were selected and analyzed using the PC-based CRISP and TRIMERGE image-processing packages (20Hovmoller S. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 41: 121-135Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar). For each Fourier transform, amplitudes and phases were extracted after refinement of the reciprocal lattice parameters. A similar procedure was applied to the image of the untilted crystal to allow the determination of the tilt axis relative to the crystallographic axes and to determine the tilt angle. A resolution cutoff of 2.5 nm was applied, before individual data sets were merged for calculation of the three-dimensional map. Because the crystals were relatively small, each set of structure factors was noisy, and there was the possibility of ambiguity in the discrimination of the correct phase origin from one located at (−π,−π) with respect to it. This problem was addressed by comparing average interimage phase residuals for the two possible origins using initially only reflections where (h + k) = odd, which are reflections which will have different phases for the two alternative phase origins. The phase origin associated with the lowest mean interimage phase residual with respect to the core data set was the one chosen for further processing, and this origin was then applied to the full set of reflections. Discrimination between the two alternative phase origins was particularly important for low tilt angle data, where the phases approximate to 0 or π. After merging, lattice lines (alongz*) were examined for all reflections (h, k), and structure factors (h, k, l) were extracted by sampling the lattice lines at intervals of 1/16 nm−1, where 16 nm represents double the expected thickness of the specimen. Structure factors were then used to generate a three-dimensional map using reverse Fourier transformation. The map was examined either with the PC-based software TriView (20Hovmoller S. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 41: 121-135Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar), or with contour maps of regular slices through the three-dimensional map, which were generated using the CCP4 (30CCP4: Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 Acta Crystallog. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar) software. Resolution was estimated by evaluating the average interimage phase residual over different resolution ranges. The final three-dimensional structure was calculated using 21 untilted crystals and 50 tilted crystals. Tilt angles varied from 0 to 60o, with 34 files in the 0–20orange, 21 files in the 21–40o range, and 16 files in the 41–60o range. Estimated resolution was 2.5 nm (in theab crystal plane) and approximately 4.0 nm along the direction perpendicular to the ab plane (see Fig. 3). Fig. 1a shows a typical crystalline area attached to the periphery of a grana membrane, and in Fig. 1 b, the same area is shown tilted at an angle of 40o. In preparations, such crystals could be observed at the edges of most of the grana membranes and were found to be of variable size. The crystals shown in the figure are of average dimensions, and the largest crystals observed were about twice the area of the larger crystal shown. Crystals were often found with others in a mosaic arrangement and were always in association with the grana membranes, and they presumably retain a lipid bilayer within the crystal matrix. The Fourier transforms of the larger crystalline area in Fig. 1 are shown for the untilted (left) and tilted (right) specimen (lower panels). In the untilted case, axial reflections with indices h,0 or 0,kare systematically absent where h or k is odd. In fact these forbidden reflections for p22121 are weakly present rather than totally absent, due to differential staining of the two sides of the crystal. For this reason, in the analysis of the untilted crystals we applied p2 symmetry rather than p22121 symmetry. No symmetry restrictions were applied for the analysis of images of tilted crystals. Table I summarizes the crystallographic image processing data for the higher plant PSI data set. Fig. 2 shows the projection maps calculated for (a) p2 symmetry and (b) p22121 symmetry for the untilted PSI crystals. The effect of differential negative staining of the p22121 unit cell is clearly observed in Fig. 2 a, where two of the four complexes in the unit cell have a higher maximum density and are much better stained than the other two.Table IImage processing and crystallographic dataNo. of processed images71Maximum tilt angle60°Calibrated magnification×34,850, ×27,500nm/pixel0.74, 0.78Unit cell parametersa = 26.6 nm, b = 27.7 nm, γ = 90°Two-dimensional plane group1-aBecause of differential staining of the two sides of the crystal, p2 symmetry was applied in the processing of untilted crystals, while no symmetry was applied for the tilted crystals.p22121Sampling interval alongz1-aBecause of differential staining of the two sides of the crystal, p2 symmetry was applied in the processing of untilted crystals, while no symmetry was applied for the tilted crystals.0.0625 nm−1No. of measured reflections2586No. of used structure factors497h max, k max,l max8, 8, 5Overall interimage phase residual to 2.5-nm resolution31.9°min, max, r.m.s. of density map−77, 130, 28Estimated volume of PSI657 nm3Estimated mass of PSI500 kDa1-a Because of differential staining of the two sides of the crystal, p2 symmetry was applied in the processing of untilted crystals, while no symmetry was applied for the tilted crystals.

Unit cell dimensions are a = 26.6 nm, b = 27.7 nm, γ = 90°. The maps were contoured in evenly spaced steps beginning at 0.5 × r.m.s. deviation above the mean density level. There are four PSI complexes in the unit cell, each complex measuring approximately 15–16 nm in length and 11–12 nm across. A central ridge of density runs across the complex, almost perpendicular to its longest axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3 shows data for phase and amplitude along two lattice lines for (h, k) (2, −2) and (2, −5). The scatter of phases around the line of best fit is reasonable for both lattice lines, although the scatter is somewhat worse for the higher resolution reflection. It can be seen that sufficient data has been collected for both reflections to allow a reasonably good extrapolation of the phases to about 4-nm resolution along z*. In contrast, the variation of amplitudes along the same lattice lines is quite large. The effect of less well defined amplitudes compared with phases on the final calculated three-dimensional structure is to make the positions of domains well defined, while the density of the domains is much less accurately defined. Thus in interpreting the three-dimensional map, the relative positions of domains may be relied upon, but any discussion of their relative sizes (when contoured similarly) will be less reliable. Three-dimensional representations of higher plant PSI and the PSI unit cell are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. In Fig. 4, sections through the three-dimensional map are shown that are parallel to the crystal plane, starting at the lower surface of the crystal (Fig. 4 a) and moving in 1.3-nm equidistant steps to the upper face of the crystal (Fig. 4 f). Each section is contoured to indicate areas of increasing protein density, with the first contour at 0.5 times r.m.s. deviation above the mean density level. The lower sections (Fig. 4,a–c) are more deeply stain-embedded and hence the higher contrast gives higher apparent density. In these sections, two complexes in the unit cell show a stromal face, while the other two complexes show the lumenal face. The stromal face is characterized by a ridge that is roughly L-shaped (section a), being composed of two elliptical domains at right angles to each other, and a third domain positioned at the apex of the “L.” Only weak density can be found for the lumenal face in section a, suggesting that the stromal face of the complex extends much further than the lumenal face (see also Fig. 5). In subsequent sections (b, c), the stromal side is characterized by a very strong central domain with a density maxima directly underneath and between the two larger elliptical domains of the L-shaped ridge. In these sections, density for the lumenal face becomes apparent, formed by two domains separated by a shallow central pit. In the central section (d), the double-lobed shape of this domain begins to be replaced by a single off-center domain, while the strong central domain of the stromal side has become a relatively featureless density. Moving toward the opposite side of the crystal, one would expect to see the reappearance of the double-lobed feature and the central ridge, and these features should be apparent in the oppositely oriented molecules (i.e. the ones flipped with respect to the membrane plane. Thus, where a stromal ridge was apparent, there should now be a double-lobed shape, and vice versa. To a certain degree, this expectation is confirmed in the upper sections (e) and (f); however, the stain on this side of the crystal is considerably shallower, and thus the level of noise in these low contrast sections may well be too high for a detailed analysis of the structure. It is therefore opportune that both sides of the PSI complex are exposed on the lower, better stained side of the crystal.Figure 5Presentations of higher plant PSI using surface rendering with the three-dimensional graphics program TriView (20Hovmoller S. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 41: 121-135Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In panels a and b the stromal and lumenal surfaces respectively are displayed with the rest of the complex removed for clarity. The viewing direction is from the deeply stained side of the crystal in contact with the specimen support film, and the crystallographic a axis is horizontal; theb axis is vertical. Illumination is from a direction parallel to the viewing direction. Depth cueing is enhanced by the color scheme, which displays structure closer to the observer in pink/brown hues, while gray-blueish hues are further away from the observer. In c, one half of the unit cell is viewed from the center of the plane of the crystal along a direction parallel to the crystallographic b axis, with the stromal ridge uppermost in the left-hand complex and the lumenal surface uppermost on the right. The upper surface is the one in contact with the specimen support film. The two parallel white lines represent the expected limits of the lipid bilayer, which is about 4.5 nm in width.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Fig. 5, the three-dimensional structure of the PSI complex is depicted using surface rendering and simulated illumination to give the impression of a solid object. In panels a and b, only the nearest part the complex is viewed from the better stained side of the crystal, and for clarity, the rest of the crystal (more distant from the observer in this case) is removed from the representation. The L-shaped stromal ridge and the double-lobed lumenal surface are apparent. Note that the handedness of these features is reversed compared with Fig. 4, because the viewing direction is now from the opposite side of the crystal. When rotated through 90o and viewed from a direction parallel to the membrane plane (panel c), the complex shows a thickness of about 8 nm, with the stromal ridge comprising about 2.5 nm of this distance. In comparison, the lumenal side of the complex seems to project to only about half the height of the stromal ridge, explaining why the lumenal surface is almost absent in the lowermost section of the third-dimensional map in Fig. 4 (section a). The parallelwhite lines in c represent the expected limits of a 4.5-nm thick lipid bilayer. The higher plant PSI complex has been the subject of much biochemical and genetic investigation, and much is now known about its polypeptide subunits and electron transfer components (1Bryant D.A. Barber J. Current Topics in Photosynthesis. 11. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 1-27Google Scholar, 17Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Zilber A. Malkin R. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, relatively little has been learned about the three-dimensional structure of higher plant PSI and how these subunits come together in the complex. In the absence of such information, it has been necessary to rely on comparisons with the cyanobacterial PSI complex, for which excellent structural data are available (14Krauss N. Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Stuct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 15Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Such comparisons, though, have inevitably been of limited application since, as discussed earlier, the higher plant complex contains several additional features that make it larger and more complicated than the cyanobacterial version. Fortunately, it seems very likely that the conserved reaction center core of the complex will show few structural variations; there is a high (∼80%) amino acid sequence homology between the reaction center subunits Psa-A and Psa-B from plants and cyanobacteria (21Fish L. Kuck U. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1413-1421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Therefore, as an initial exercise in modeling the higher plant PSI complex, we have attempted to correlate the cyanobacterial reaction center structure with the molecular envelope of the higher plant PSI complex in negative stain. Such an exercise may highlight significant differences between the two systems and point to possible structural explanations for the differing behavior of the cyanobacterial and plant complexes. In Fig. 6, schematic drawings of the smaller cyanobacterial PSI complex (right-hand side) and the larger higher plant PSI complex (left) are displayed in top and side views as well as a space-filling representations. The approximate predicted positions of some of the PSI subunits are highlighted using the letters that are used for their nomenclature. The overall shapes of the two complexes are similar as shown in thelower panel in Fig. 6, although the higher plant complex is slightly larger (except in the dimension orthogonal to the membrane). The dimensions for the higher plant complex (∼15 × 12.5 × 8 nm) shown in Fig. 5 may be an underestimate, as it is feasible that subunits that protrude only to a minor extent from the lipid bilayer may have escaped staining. It is known that several PSI subunits, including the LHCI polypeptides, fall into this category (1Bryant D.A. Barber J. Current Topics in Photosynthesis. 11. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 1-27Google Scholar, 17Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Further electron crystallography studies on unstained crystals will be needed in order to resolve this question. The extrinsically bound stromal subunits in PSI (Psa-C, -D, and -E) appear to be arranged close together on the stromal surface of the large Psa-A and -B subunits. By comparison with the cyanobacterial arrangement, we predict that the Psa-C subunit will be located in the central domain of the ridge, while the Psa-D and -E subunits will flank it. There is no evidence from the structural data that these subunits stack on top of each other. Electron transfer from the iron-sulfur centers of subunit Psa-C to the soluble electron acceptor protein, ferredoxin, must involve the binding of ferredoxin in very close proximity to Psa-C, although it is known that this binding appears to be mediated by the Psa-D and -E subunits (22Lagoutte B. Vallon O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1175-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Anderson B. Koch B. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 84: 154-161Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The structural basis of this binding is not yet clear, although some studies of ferredoxin binding have been carried out using electron microscopy of the cyanobacterial complex (24Lelong C. Boekema E.J. Kruip J. Bottin H. Rogner M. Setif P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2160-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the cyanobacterial PSI structure (15Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krauss N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the location of the Psa-L subunit has been predicted to lie close to the 3-fold axis of the trimers that are found in the crystals (Fig. 5). These predictions are based on the observation that mutants lacking this subunit have fully functional PSI, but no longer form trimeric complexes after detergent solubilization (25Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, higher plant PSI complexes contain the Psa-L subunit, but do not form trimeric complexes, which suggests that Psa-L may have a function that is unrelated to the native oligomeric form of the complex. Indeed, it has been proposed that the trimeric cyanobacterial complex may be a product of detergent solubilization (8Ford R.C. Hefti A. Engel A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,11Hefti A. Ford R.C. Miller M. Cox R.P. Engel A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and structural evidence for the existence of the trimer in native cyanobacterial membranes is scant (11Hefti A. Ford R.C. Miller M. Cox R.P. Engel A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Ford R.C. Holzenburg A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2287-2293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hladik J. Sofrova D. Photosynth. Res. 1991; 29: 171-175PubMed Google Scholar) while the observation of the monomeric form has been reported in cyanobacterial thylakoids and in reconstituted membranes (8Ford R.C. Hefti A. Engel A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Hefti A. Ford R.C. Miller M. Cox R.P. Engel A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Ford R.C. Holzenburg A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2287-2293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the higher plant PSI structure, the overall shape of the complex is rather similar to the cyanobacterial form, and both show the apical domain that is predicted to be the Psa-L location. There is no obvious structural feature in the higher plant complex that would prevent trimerization around this apical domain, and the two sides of the complex that straddle the apical domain subtend an angle of about 120° (Fig. 6), which would allow packing into a trimeric complex. The lumenal side of PSI in cyanobacteria has been shown to project only about 1 nm into the aqueous phase, and in some reports, the presence of a small central depression has been observed (8Ford R.C. Hefti A. Engel A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3067-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Bottcher B. Graber P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This feature is also present in the higher plant PSI structure, where it is found to be approximately 3 nm in diameter and about 0.5–1.0 nm in depth. The depression is partly flanked by two domains that may be formed from lumenally exposed loops of the intergral membrane proteins Psa-A and -B. In order to transfer its electon to the oxidized primary donor of PSI (P700+), plastocyanin must bind somewhere very close to the pseudo-2-fold axis of rotational symmetry on the lumenal face of the PSI complex. This binding location would therefore be close to the center of the lumenal depression. In higher plants the subunit Psa-F has been reported to be involved in mediating the binding of the soluble electron donor protein plastocyanin to PSI (29Zilber A. Malkin R. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Max-Wynn R. Malkin R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5863-5869Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), although there is no supporting evidence for this role in cyanobacterial studies (32Fromme P. Schubert W.D. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1141: 175-182Google Scholar). There is no obvious domain in the three-dimensional map that could immediately be assigned to Psa-F, and further studies are required to address this.

Experiments performed with truncated pumps indicated that the stimulation by ethanol was lost if the C-terminal region between Lys1065 and Lys1161, encompassing the calmodulin binding domain, was removed.

The plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase is regulated by several mechanisms. It can be stimulated by calmodulin (1Gopinath R.M. Vincenzi F.F. Am. J. Hematol. 1981; 7: 303-312Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Jarret H.W. Penniston J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), acidic phospholipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (3Niggli V. Adunyah E.S. Carafoli E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2195-2205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Short chain alkyl alcohols have also recently been found to stimulate Ca2+-ATPase (6Benaim G. Cervino V. Lopez-Estraño C. Weitzman C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), increasing the maximal velocity of the enzyme to levels that are higher than those obtained with other activators (e.g. calmodulin (6Benaim G. Cervino V. Lopez-Estraño C. Weitzman C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). The effects of ethanol and calmodulin have been found to be additive. This suggests that ethanol and calmodulin stimulate the Ca2+-ATPase through different mechanisms (6Benaim G. Cervino V. Lopez-Estraño C. Weitzman C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ethanol was found to be active on both the membrane-bound (i.e.erythrocyte ghosts) and purified enzymes, indicating that its effects were not linked to the solubilization of the enzyme from the membrane environment. Furthermore, ethanol stimulated the Ca2+transport by inside-out plasma membrane vesicles at concentrations similar to those needed to stimulate the activity of the purified Ca2+-ATPase. It was effective at pharmacological concentrations (7Hoek J.B. Thomas A.P. Rooney T.A. Higashi K. Rubin E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2386-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), a finding suggesting the possible in vivo involvement of the activation of the pump. Phosphatidylethanol, which is formed by a phospholipase D-catalyzed transphosphatidylation of phospholipids with ethanol, was found to accumulate in the plasma membrane after treatment of the animals with ethanol (7Hoek J.B. Thomas A.P. Rooney T.A. Higashi K. Rubin E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2386-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and to stimulate the Ca2+-ATPase of human erythrocytes (8Suju M. Davila M. Poleo G. Docampo R. Benaim G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in a manner additive with calmodulin. These observations are all consistent with the suggestion that the decrease in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration reported in some cells after ethanol intoxication could be due to the stimulation of the Ca2+-ATPase. The active agent could be phosphatidylethanol, ethanol, or a combination of both. The stimulatory effect of ethanol has so far been studied in erythrocytes, where only two PMCA1 isoforms are present, and in the parasite Leishmania mexicana (9Benaim G. Tapia F. Caceres-Dittmar G. Sanchez M.A. Molecular and Immune Mechanism in the Pathogenesis of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 89-106Google Scholar). It thus seemed interesting to study the effect of ethanol on different PMCA isoforms. To this purpose, the isoforms were expressed in Sf9 cells with the help of the baculovirus system. Ethanol stimulated the activity of all the isoforms, but its potency was isoform-specific, the greatest effect being observed on PMCA2CI, which is expressed almost exclusively in nerve cells (10Carafoli E. Garcia Martin E. Guerini D. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The effect of ethanol was also studied on truncated forms of the enzyme, leading to the suggestion that a region between Lys1065 and Lys1161 of the PMCA4 Ca2+-ATPase, encompassing the calmodulin binding domain, is essential for ethanol stimulation. TNM-FH medium was purchased from Sigma, and fetal calf serum was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Basel, Switzerland). The other reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. The preparations of the recombinant viruses for PMCA2ACI, PMCA4CI, PMCA4CII, PMCA4Δ139, PMCA4Δ44, and PMCA1CI have already been described (11Heim R. Iwata T. Zvaritch E. Adamo H.P. Rutishauser B.

An “empty” recombinant virus (control virus) was isolated during the preparation of the recombinant viruses. This virus was likely to be the result of a deletion in the coding sequence. 2D. Guerini, unpublished observations. It replicated as the other recombinant viruses but did not express any recombinant peptide. Spodoptera frugiperda cells were grown in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 30 °C. Amplification and titration of the recombinant viruses and infection of the Sf9 cells were performed according to standard protocols (16Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1988; 1555: 1-50Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were seeded at a density of 104/cm2 and left to attach for 1 h. They were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10 for 1 h. The inoculum was replaced by fresh medium. After 48 h, the infected cells were collected, washed twice with TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.9% NaCl) and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (1 × 107 cells/ml). After 10 min on ice and after the addition of 75 μg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml trasylol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, the cells were homogenized with 30 strokes in a tightly fitting glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was diluted with an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% sucrose, 300 mm KCl, 75 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml trasylol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and centrifuged at low speed (750 × g) for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C after the addition of 5 mm EDTA. The pellet was resuspended in TNS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 2 mm EGTA). The membranes were stored in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm sucrose at 2–5 mg/ml at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The ATPase activity was measured as described by Lanzetta et al. (18Lanzetta P. Alvarez L. Reinach P. Candia O. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) in 100 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm ouabain, 0.5 μmthapsigargin, 4 μg/ml oligomycin, and, normally, 0.6 mmCaCl2, resulting in a free Ca2+ concentration of 0.8 μm (calculated as described by Fabiato and Fabiato (19Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar)). If needed, 5 μg/ml calmodulin was also present. The Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent ATPase activities were defined as the total ATPase activity (measured in the presence of Ca2+ or Ca2+/calmodulin) minus the Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity. Standard analysis was performed with the Anova 2 program (Duncan test). The formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate from ATP was performed as described before (13Seiz-Preianò B. Guerini D. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7946-7953Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In brief, 20–60 μg of membrane proteins were diluted in 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 6.8, 100 mmKCl in the presence of different concentrations of Ca2+, La3+, or EGTA. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.3–0.5 μm [γ-32P]ATP (100–3000 Ci/mmol) on ice and stopped after 40 s by the addition of 7% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration), 10 mmNa2HPO4. The pelleted proteins were separated on acidic gels (20Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After drying, the gels were exposed at −70 °C for 2–5 days.

The PMCA4CI and PMCA4CII, PMCA2CI and PMCA1CI proteins have been expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus system. Details of the construction of the expression vectors, the generation of the recombinant viruses, and the characterization of the biochemical properties of the expressed proteins have been described elsewhere (11Heim R.

Membrane proteins of the infected cells contained large amounts of PMCA2CI, PMCA4CII, PMCA4CI, PMCA4CIΔ44, and PMCA4CIΔ139 proteins, respectively. The amounts of PMCA1CI protein were reproducibly lower than those of the other recombinant proteins (15Pan B. Overexpression and Functional Characterization of Three Isoforms of Plasma Membrane Ca2+-ATPase.Ph.D. thesis. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, 1995Google Scholar) but still adequate for activity measurements in membrane preparations. A typical result of the expression of the PMCA isoforms is shown in Fig. 1 A; in the Coomassie Blue-stained gels, strong bands in the 116–140-kDa region are visible (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3–7), which are not present in noninfected Sf9 cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) or in cells infected with control virus (Fig. 1 A, lane 8). In the case of cells infected with the recombinant virus for the PMCA1CI protein, no band at 135 kDa was visible (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), but a PMCA1CI-specific band at 135 kDa was evident in Western blotting stained with the 5F10 general antibody or with the antibody specific for the 1N isoform (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). Strong staining with the 5F10 antibody was observed with the PMCA2CI, -4CII, -4CI, -4CIΔ44, and -4CIΔ139 proteins (Fig. 1 B, panel 5F10, lanes 3–7). The 2N antibody showed a reaction in membranes expressing the PMCA2CI protein (Fig. 1 B, lane 3), while the 4N antibody recognized the PMCA4CII, PMCA4CI, and two truncated versions of the pump (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–7). The 94.2 antibody, which recognizes an epitope located within the C terminus of the PMCA4CI isoform (13Seiz-Preianò B. Guerini D. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7946-7953Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), showed a strong reaction with the PMCA4CI protein (Fig. 1 B, panel 94.2, lane 5), whereas only weak reactions were observed with the alternatively spliced isoform PMCA4CII (Fig. 1 B, panel 94.2, lane 4) and the two truncated mutants PMCA4CIΔ44 and 4CIΔ139 (Fig. 1 B, panel 94.2, lanes 6 and 7). None of the antibodies reacted with noninfected Sf9 cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) or with cells infected with control virus (Fig. 1 B, lane 8). The four expressed PMCA proteins were able to form the Ca2+- and La3+-dependent phosphoenzyme intermediate (PMCA4CI and PMCA4CII shown in Fig. 1 C; PMCA2CI and PMCA1CI not shown). The membranes from infected cells had high levels of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. The values (collected from 8–10 independent experiments) are summarized in Table I. The Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of Sf9 cells and cells infected with control virus was lower than in Sf9 cells expressing the PMCA pumps. The addition of calmodulin increased the activity of Sf9 cells containing the pumps 2–3 times, with the exception of the PMCA4CIΔ139 truncated pump. No difference upon the addition of calmodulin was observed in membranes from Sf9 cells or from cells infected with the control virus (Table I). The Mg2+-dependent activity was similar in all the membranes and amounted to 170 ± 10 nmol of Pi/min·mg of protein.Table IThe Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent ATPase activity of Sf9 cells membranes expressing the different PMCA isoformsCa2+-dependent activityCa2+-calmodulin-dependent activitynmol Pi/min·mgnmol Pi/min·mgSf915.7 ± 0.615.6 ± 0.5Control virus13.5 ± 0.515 ± 0.5PMCA1CI28 ± 252.4 ± 3PMCA2CI87.2 ± 7161.6 ± 11.6PMCA4CII123 ± 14212.4 ± 14.4PMCA4CI159 ± 16299 ± 16.6PMCA4Δ44128.4 ± 12303 ± 16PMCA4Δ139340 ± 10360 ± 9The activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard analysis was performed with the Anova 2 program (Duncan test). Open table in a new tab The activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard analysis was performed with the Anova 2 program (Duncan test). The activity was consistent with the amount of protein detected in the Western blots and measured with the phosphoenzyme intermediate experiments. The membranes of cells expressing the PMCA2CI, PMCA4CI, and PMCA4CII proteins had similar Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent ATPase activity, while, as expected, that of membranes containing the PMCA1CI pump was lower. As expected, higher concentrations of calmodulin were necessary for maximal stimulation of the PMCA4CII isoform, whose affinity to calmodulin is 20–50 times lower than that of the three other proteins (13Seiz-Preianò B. Guerini D. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7946-7953Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To study the effect of ethanol, membranes of Sf9 cells expressing the four isoforms were incubated with different concentrations of ethanol with Ca2+ in the absence and in the presence of calmodulin. Ethanol did not stimulate the activity in the absence or in the presence of calmodulin in the case of uninfected Sf9 cells or of Sf9 cells infected with the control virus (Fig. 2, A and B). As already described for the erythrocyte pump (6Benaim G. Cervino V. Lopez-Estraño C. Weitzman C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), both the basal and the calmodulin-dependent ATPase activities of the four isoforms tested were stimulated by ethanol (Figs. 2, C–F). The response, however, was different in the four isoforms; the PMCA1CI and PMCA2CI proteins were maximally stimulated by 1 and 0.5% ethanol, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D), whereas the PMCA4CII and PMCA4CI proteins required higher concentrations (Fig. 2,E and F). The shape of the activation curves differed as well. In the case of the PMCA2CI pump, maximal activation was obtained in a narrow range of ethanol concentrations (0.2–1.2% (v/v), Fig. 2 D). In contrast, the PMCA4CI pump showed a broad and less pronounced activation between 2 and 8% ethanol. These data suggest a correlation between the affinity of the pump for calmodulin and the response to ethanol; the isoform having the highest affinity (PMCA2CI) was stimulated by the lowest concentrations of ethanol, whereas isoforms having lower affinity to calmodulin (PMCA4 isoforms) required higher amounts of it. In addition, isoforms PMCA4CII and PMCA4CI, which are the products of C-terminal alternative splicing (they only differ in their last 70–80 C-terminal amino acids) reacted differently with ethanol (Fig. 2, E and F). The effect on the PMCA4CII protein (Fig. 2 E) was more pronounced at lower concentrations and resulted in a higher stimulation than in the case of the PMCA4CI isoform (Fig. 2 F). The two truncated versions of the PMCA4CI pump, PMCA4CIΔ44 and PMCA4CIΔ139 (14Zvaritch E. Vellani F. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2679-2688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were also expressed (Fig. 1, A and B) to explore the possible involvement of the calmodulin binding region in the stimulation by ethanol. These mutants lack 44 and 139 C-terminal amino acids, respectively. The Δ44 mutant was activated by calmodulin to a degree similar to that of the PMCA4CI protein, while the Δ139 mutant, which lacks the calmodulin binding domain, was not (Fig. 3). Interestingly, ethanol still activated the PMCA4CIΔ44 mutant (Fig. 3 A) but had no activating effect on the PMCA4CIΔ139 mutant (Fig. 3 B). It produced, instead, a slow inactivation at high concentrations that was probably linked to the instability of the protein. No effects of ethanol were observed on the amounts of phosphoenzyme intermediate formed by the isoforms (Fig. 1 C). The concentrations of ethanol in these experiments were those yielding maximal activation for each isoforms (Fig. 2). The effect of ethanol on the activity of the PMCA pump had been described first in red blood cells (6Benaim G. Cervino V. Lopez-Estraño C. Weitzman C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which contain the PMCA1CI and PMCA4CI pumps in a ratio of about 1:4 (23Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It was, thus, not surprising that the activation of the overexpressed PMCA4CI protein by ethanol was similar to that of the pump in the red blood cells. Rather unexpectedly, however, differences were evident in the activation of the other isoforms. Although the interpretation of the shape of the activation curves is not clear cut (at high concentrations the effect of ethanol is likely to be complicated by the inhibition of the pump due to its partial denaturation), the results in Fig. 2 undoubtedly indicate that the isoforms are differently stimulated by ethanol. The observed differences between the PMCA4CI and PMCA4CII pumps make it unlikely that ethanol interfered with the lipid bilayer surrounding the pump protein in the membrane, since PMCA4CI and PMCA4CII only differ in the last 70–80 C-terminal amino acids, which are not membrane-intrinsic. This conclusion was supported by the experiments on the two truncated mutants, which strongly suggest that the effect of ethanol was mediated by the C-terminal region encompassing the calmodulin binding domain. Different experiments have indicated that the calmodulin binding domain interacts with two sites on the resting ATPase molecule (24Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Brunner J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2930-2936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Falchetto R. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), located in the first and second large cytosolic loops (26Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Ethanol could influence the association of the calmodulin binding domain with the receptor sites by reducing its affinity to them. The binding of calmodulin is assumed to displace the calmodulin binding domain from the receptor site, freeing the pump from the autoinhibition (27Benaim G. Zurini M. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8471-8477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Carafoli E. Chiesi M. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 32: 209-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29James P. Maeda M. Fischer R. Verma A.K. Krebs J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2905-2910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Possibly, the binding of calmodulin would displace the peptide from its receptor site only partially and ethanol would cooperate with calmodulin to completely remove the inhibition. This would explain the effect of ethanol on the calmodulin-stimulated pump and would be consistent with the results on the truncated mutants. In other words, ethanol would interact with the calmodulin binding domain. However, it is also possible that the ethanol binding site is located near the calmodulin binding domain but does not exactly overlap with it. This site could also encompass a second autoinhibitory domain of the PMCA pump. Recent observations, in fact, have indicated that the autoinhibitory domain of the PMCA pump does not necessary correspond exactly to the calmodulin binding domain (30Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3714-3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Caution is necessary in discussing the possible pharmacological significance of the results, since the amounts of ethanol needed for the activation are generally high. However, the activity of the PMCA2CI pump was already affected by 0.1–0.2% ethanol, a concentration that may be found in the blood of humans after alcohol consumption. This could be all the more significant, since the PMCA2CI pump is expressed at high levels only in the brain (23Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 31Stauffer T. Hilfiker H. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol.

It is tempting to speculate that the effects of ethanol intoxication may (partially) result from the overactivation of the PMCA2CI pump, which would diminish the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and thus dramatically affect cell signaling."

This investigation uses the vaccinia enzyme as a readily available and convenient model for understanding the cellular enzyme. As previously reported for T4 phage aerobic rNDP reductase, we found the relative activities of ADP, CDP, GDP, and UDP reduction to be reasonably close to the proportions of the four deoxyribonucleotides in the vaccinia virus genome, but only when the four substrates and the four allosteric effectors were all provided at their approximate intracellular concentrations. GDP reductase levels were somewhat higher, proportionately, than the representation of dGMP in vaccinia virus DNA. To understand this behavior and also to evaluate possible relationships between ribonucleotide reductase control and the very low dGTP pools seen in eukaryotic cells, we carried out substrate saturation experiments with a “bioproportional” mixture containing the four rNDP substrates at their relative in vivoconcentrations as determined from rNDP pool measurements. Reduction of the two purine substrates was inhibited at high concentrations of this mixture, and data suggest that ADP acts as a specific inhibitor of its own reduction and that of GDP. Use of the four-substrate assay revealed also that a mixture of vaccinia virus R1 protein and mouse R2 protein is catalytically active, making this the first reported chimeric rNDP reductase to show biological activity.

The allosteric regulation of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)1 by individual nucleoside triphosphates is well characterized for several forms of the enzyme (1Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 2Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The three classes of RNR, although quite different in structure (3Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 140-173Google Scholar), have similar allosteric behavior in terms of the effects of modifiers upon substrate specificity. In all classes, ATP and dATP (when it is not inhibitory) activate reduction of the cytidine and uridine nucleotides. Reduction of adenosine and guanosine nucleotides is stimulated by dGTP and dTTP, respectively. These effects are mediated through binding of nucleotides to two different allosteric sites on the dimeric R1 (large) protein: the activity sites, which bind with relatively low affinity ATP (general activator) or dATP (general inhibitor), and the specificity sites, which bind with higher affinity ATP, dATP, dGTP, or dCTP, with the binding of each ligand activating the inhibition of some substrates and inhibiting that of others. However, due primarily to limitations of traditional RNR assay methods, only the isolated effects of individual allosteric effectors have been determined, in kinetic experiments involving single substrates. We have developed an assay procedure (4Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that permits simultaneous monitoring of the four RNR activities. With this procedure, the effects of more complex nucleotide environments on substrate turnover rates can be examined. In addition, other factors that influence relative turnover rates, such as protein-protein interactions, can be evaluated by this technique. Because of the ease with which it can be purified in large quantities as a recombinant enzyme, we are using the class I RNR encoded by vaccinia virus as a model for the closely related mammalian cell enzymes. The two viral RNR genes express proteins similar in size to mammalian R1 (large) and R2 (small) RNR proteins, and the molecular weight of the holoenzyme suggests the α2β2tetrameric structure characteristic of the cellular enzymes. Also, like the cellular RNRs, the viral enzyme reduces ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, via a free radical mechanism that involves a tyrosyl residue on the R2 subunit (5Howell M.L. Sanders-Loehr J. Loehr T.M. Roseman N.A. Mathews C.K. Slabaugh M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1705-1711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with catalytic and allosteric sites located on the R1 subunit. The vaccinia R1 and R2 proteins share about 80% amino acid sequence identity with corresponding mammalian RNR proteins (6Slabaugh M.B. Roseman N.A. Davis R.E. Mathews C.K. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 519-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tengelson L.A. Slabaugh M.B. Bibler J.K. Hruby D.E. Virology. 1988; 164: 7426-7432Google Scholar). Preliminary data, obtained when the vaccinia enzyme was first described in our laboratory (8Slabaugh M.B. Johnson T.L. Mathews C.K. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 507-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicate that the viral enzyme is regulated similarly to the mammalian enzyme. This study explored that regulation in more detail, using the four-substrate assay. Both subunits of vaccinia ribonucleotide reductase were previously cloned into isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible pET expression vectors and were overexpressed as described (5Howell M.L.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was a gift from the laboratory of Lars Thelander (Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden). Overexpression of the mouse R2 was carried out according to the procedure used to express the vaccinia R2. The mouse R2 clone contains two selectable markers encoding drug resistance gene products, and therefore, the addition of 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol was required in conjunction with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The purification procedure for the vaccinia R2 subunit was essentially as reported (5Howell M.L. Sanders-Loehr J. Loehr T.M. Roseman N.A. Mathews C.K. Slabaugh M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1705-1711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except for the incorporation of an additional radical reactivation step, described in the accompanying paper (11Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29519-29523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mouse R2 protein was purified by the same procedure used to purify the vaccinia R2 (5Howell M.L. Sanders-Loehr J. Loehr T.M. Roseman N.A. Mathews C.K. Slabaugh M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1705-1711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the vaccinia R1 protein was performed also as described in the accompanying paper (11Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29519-29523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The assay was carried out as described earlier (4Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Essentially, the technique involves two chromatographic steps for resolution of complex reaction mixtures. The first step, boronate affinity chromatography, separates the reaction products (dNDPs) from ATP and unreacted substrates (rNDPs). In the second step, the dNDPs are resolved into individual nucleotides and separated from dNTP allosteric effectors by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The concentration of the vaccinia and mouse R2 proteins used in these experiments was 4 μm. Vaccinia R1 was added to 1 μm final concentration. ATP and DTT were present in all reaction mixtures at 2.5 and 50 mm, respectively. The rNDP substrates were added either at equimolar (0.15 mm each) orin vivo concentrations. The in vivoconcentrations for rCDP, rUDP, rADP, and rGDP were set to 50, 250, 600, and 100 μm, respectively. These values were based on the experimentally determined molar ratio of rNDPs measured in vaccinia-infected BSC40 cells (see below). The in vivo dNTP concentrations used in these assays were 15, 10, and 5 μm dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, respectively. These concentrations were based on dNTP measurements made in vaccinia-infected BSC40 cells (12Slabaugh M.B. Howell M.L. Wang Y. Mathews C.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2290-2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The volume of a vaccinia virus-infected BSC40 cell was not determined in these experiments. However, nucleated mammalian cell volumes range from approximately 1 to 3 picoliters per cell (13Hauschka P.V. Methods Cell Biol. 1973; 7: 361-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). At the mid-range value of 2 picoliters, the estimated concentrations of dATP, dTTP, and dGTP are the values given above and used in these experiments. Although microcompartmentation effects might affect these values, the fact that vaccinia virus replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells indicates that the dNTPs are distributed throughout most of the aqueous portion of the intracellular space. Monkey kidney BSC40 cells were infected with vaccinia virus strain WR as described previously (8Slabaugh M.B. Johnson T.L. Mathews C.K. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 507-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12Slabaugh M.B. Howell M.L. Wang Y. Mathews C.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2290-2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 4 h postinfection so that the nucleotide pool measurements would reflect the levels that exist during peak viral DNA replication. Cell extracts were prepared by treating cells with 0.4m aqueous perchloric acid. After 5 min on ice, the perchloric acid-extracted cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was neutralized with NaOH (neutralization with KOH resulted in a significant loss of nucleotides from the soluble fraction). The extract was lyophilized to dryness, and the residue was redissolved in 75 mm ammonium phosphate buffer (pH 3.7) just prior to analysis. The total nucleotide extract was analyzed by HPLC, using the same anion exchange column and ammonium phosphate buffer system used in the four-substrate RNR assay. Peak identities were verified by “spiking” the extract with authentic standards. Fig. 1demonstrates the application of the four-substrate RNR assay to the purified vaccinia virus enzyme. In this experiment, ATP (2.5 mm) was added as the sole allosteric modifier. Under these conditions, CDP and GDP were the principal substrates reduced. Reduction of UDP was low or negligible in this and all other assays performed. Mammalian cells have been shown to derive most of their DNA thymidylate residues from deoxycytidine nucleotides, via the dCMP deaminase reaction, rather than through the reduction of uridine nucleotides (14Bianchi V. Pontis E. Reichard P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4218-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and these data suggest that the same situation holds true for vaccinia virus-infected cells. In this experiment, the total RNR activity, summed for the four substrates, was 77 nmol/min/mg of R1 protein. This value corresponds to a turnover number of 12.4 min–1, comparable to values reported for the recombinant mouse RNR (10Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingermarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 15Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behraven G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of our present understanding of the allosteric regulation of mammalian rNDP reductase is based upon analysis of the effects of one or two modifiers—typically, an activity site effector (dATP or ATP), in the presence or absence of a specificity site ligand (ATP, dATP, dGTP, or dTTP)—upon the reduction of single substrates. To compare the vaccinia virus rNDP reductase with its mammalian counterpart, we determined the effect of each of the four dNTPs upon the four activities of the virus enzyme in the presence of ATP, in comparison with an assay carried out in the presence of ATP alone. As shown in Fig. 2, the viral enzyme behaves virtually identically to the reported behavior of mammalian rNDP reductases. dCTP has no significant effect on any of the activities, whereas dTTP activates GDP reduction and inhibits reduction of ADP and CDP. dGTP activates reduction of ADP and inhibits CDP reduction, whereas dATP, at the concentration used, inhibits all four reactions. In this experiment, the percentage of inhibition of the reduction of each substrate by dATP (relative to the control in Fig. 2 A) was 36% for ADP, 38% for CDP, 46% for GDP, and 40% for UDP. These effects are summarized in Table I. Other experiments (not presented) showed CDP reduction to be stimulated by dATP, when added in the absence of ATP, consistent with the action of dATP as a positive effector for CDP reduction when bound at the specificity site. At higher concentrations, the inhibitory effect of dATP (in the presence of ATP) increased, as shown in Fig. 3. Within the likely physiological dATP concentration range (5–15 μm), the activity (sum of the four activities) was inhibited by 25–50%, values comparable to those reported for single substrates with the mammalian enzymes. These data confirm the appropriateness of using vaccinia rNDP reductase as a model for understanding cellular eukaryotic forms.Table IRegulation of vaccinia virus ribonucleotide reductase activities by single dNTPsdNTP (10 μm)Activates reduction ofInhibits reduction ofdCTPNo effectNo effectdTTPGDPCDP and ADPdGTPADPCDPdATPCDPADP, CDP, GDP, and UDPThese results represent changes that occur in rNDP turnover rates relative to the rates observed when the enzyme is stimulated by ATP only.

When dATP was added in conjunction with ATP (0.5–2.5 mm), all activities were inhibited relative to a control reaction containing only ATP. Our application of the four-substrate assay to T4 phage-coded aerobic ribonucleotide reductase indicated that intracellular ribonucleoside diphosphate concentrations constitute a significant regulatory factor. The relative rates of the four reactions corresponded closely to the nucleotide composition of T4 DNA, but only under conditions where all four nucleoside triphosphate effectors and all four nucleoside diphosphate substrates were present at their approximate intracellular concentrations, as estimated from pool size measurements. In determining whether the vaccinia rNDP reductase behaves similarly, it was first necessary to measure ribonucleoside diphosphate pool sizes in vaccinia virus-infected cells. These values, determined by HPLC measurements of virus-infected cell extracts as described under “Materials and Methods,” are presented in Table II. The approximate concentrations reported fall within the ranges of values compiled by Traut (16Traut T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) for uninfected mammalian cell cultures. It should be observed that the HPLC peaks from which these pool sizes were determined almost certainly include deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, as well as the ribonucleotides. However, the data compiled by Traut (16Traut T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) indicate that in mammalian cells, the rNDP pools exceed those of dNDPs by 100–1000-fold. Therefore, we assumed the contribution to peak area by the dNDPs to be negligible.Table IIRibonucleoside diphosphate concentrations in vaccinia virus-infected BSC40 cellsrNDPrNDP pool size2-aMean ± (range/2) for two independent determinations.Molar ratioEstimated intracellular concentration2-bVolume of a vaccinia-infected BSC40 cell was estimated at 2 picoliters, in the middle of the range of values reported for cultured mammalian cells.pmol/106cellsμmrCDP98 ± 13 1 50rUDP451 ± 39 5250rADP1196 ± 8812600rGDP216 ± 29 21002-a Mean ± (range/2) for two independent determinations.2-b Volume of a vaccinia-infected BSC40 cell was estimated at 2 picoliters, in the middle of the range of values reported for cultured mammalian cells. Open table in a new tab To estimate the in vivo molar concentration of each rNDP from the pool size values in pmol/106 cells, we used 2 picoliters per cell, a mid-range value for the compiled volumes of cultured mammalian cells, as reported by Hauschka (13Hauschka P.V. Methods Cell Biol. 1973; 7: 361-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These estimated concentrations, listed in Table II, are quite close to average concentrations of rNDPs in a range of mammalian cells (16Traut T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). As noted earlier, the T4 aerobic rNDP reductase in vitro reduces the four substrates at rates corresponding to the nucleotide composition of T4 DNA, but only under conditions where both substrates and allosteric effectors are present at their approximate intracellular concentrations. In mammalian cells, the ribonucleoside diphosphate pools are more strikingly asymmetric than in T4 phage-infected Escherichia coli, with more than an order of magnitude variation between the most (ADP) and least (CDP) abundant (Table II and Ref. 16Traut T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding asymmetry in the bacterial system is less than 3-fold (17Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7430-7438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Table III summarizes results of assays carried out under different conditions of substrate and effector concentrations (equimolar substrates, in vivo substrates, no dNTP effectors, in vivo effectors, etc.). Note that only in the presence of in vivo levels of both effectors and substrates does the product profile approach the nucleotide composition of the vaccinia virus genome. In particular, ADP reduction, which is negligible in the absence of dNTP effectors, approaches the representation of dATP in the genome under “physiological” conditions. Also, CDP reduction, which dominates the profile in the presence of equimolar substrates and no dNTPs, is brought to a reasonable level (34% of total activity) under physiological conditions. Note that 34% is still twice the representation of dCMP in the vaccinia genome. However, as noted earlier, dCMP is a major contributor to the dTTP pool, via the dCMP deaminase reaction. The sum of the CDP and UDP reductase activities under physiological conditions, 46%, is close to the representation of dCMP plus dTMP in the vaccinia genome (50%).Table IIIEffects of variations in substrate and effector concentrations upon specificity of vaccinia ribonucleotide reductase in the four-substrate assayAssay conditionsPercentage of total product formed asdCDPdUDPdADPdGDPATP only (equimolar substrates)76 3 219ATP only (in vivo substrates)4915 828In vivo effectors (equimolar substrates)60 31522In vivo effectors (in vivo substrates)34122926% of total nucleotides in genome of vaccinia virus17(33)3-a33% of vaccinia genomic composition is thymine.3317All reaction mixtures contained ATP at 2.5 mm.

Open table in a new tab All reaction mixtures contained ATP at 2.5 mm. Equimolar substrates were present at 0.15 mm each. In vivosubstrate levels were as follows: CDP, 50 μm; UDP, 250 μm; ADP, 600 μm; and GDP, 100 μm. In vivo allosteric effector concentrations were 15, 10, and 5 μm dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, respectively. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min, an interval within which all reactions were linear with respect to time. The data of Table III show one significant discrepancy between rNDP substrate specificity in vitro, under assumed biological conditions, and presumed reaction flux ratein vivo. dGMP accounts for only 17% of vaccinia DNA nucleotides, whereas the GDP reductase flux under physiological conditions represented 26% of the total. This result was somewhat surprising, because dGTP is by far the least abundant of the four dNTPs in cell-free extracts, both of uninfected and vaccinia virus-infected mammalian cells (12Slabaugh M.B. Howell M.L. Wang Y. Mathews C.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2290-2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mathews C.K. Ji J. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); hence, we might have expected low flux rates through rNDP reductase to contribute toward the underrepresentation of dGTP in the dNTP pool. However, because of uncertainties in the cell volumes upon which we based our rNDP concentration estimates, as well as intracellular factors that might alter effective nucleotide concentrations, the rNDP concentrations listed in Table II could be in error by 2-fold or more. On the other hand, it seems likely that any error affecting the concentration estimate for one nucleotide would affect the other three in proportion. For example, if the concentration of GDP were overestimated by 2-fold, it seems likely that concentrations of the other three rNDPs would be overestimated by similar factors. Thus, we believe that the molar ratios calculated from rNDP pool data (second column in Table II) accurately reflect the relativeconcentrations of the four substrates sensed by rNDP reductase in vivo. Accordingly, we prepared a “bioproportional” substrate mixture, in which the four rNDPs were present at their molar ratios as determined from pool analyses (ADP, CDP, GDP, and UDP present at a ratio of 12:1:2:5, respectively). This mixture was used for substrate saturation experiments, with concentrations of the individual substrates varied, but always in proportion to the representation of each rNDP in the bioproportional mixture. Results of two separate experiments are plotted together in Fig. 4. We found UDP and CDP to behave according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with saturation reached or approached at the highest concentrations tested. However, ADP and GDP both showed inhibition at the highest concentrations tested. The effect of increased concentration upon ADP reduction was particularly striking, with the highest rate of ADP reduction seen at the lowest concentration. The small but significant decrease in GDP reduction at the highest rNDP concentrations could mean that true intracellular concentrations sensed by RNR are somewhat higher than those estimated in the experiment of Table II. Thus, in vivo flux rates for vaccinia virus rNDP reductase may conform even more closely to the nucleotide composition of vaccinia DNA than does the enzyme in the in vitroexperiment of Table III. However, of greater interest is the mechanism by which purine rNDP reduction, particularly that of ADP, evidently becomes inhibited at higher concentrations. Note that because of its high representation among the rNDPs, ADP reduction rates are quite high at the lowest levels tested, because it is probably close to saturating the enzyme under these conditions. This factor—the abundance of ADP—could make it advantageous for the ADP reduction flux to be limited at the higher concentrations needed for the enzyme to act efficiently upon the other three rNDPs. In particular, this could be seen as a factor limiting the accumulation of dATP, which could otherwise block DNA replication through activity site binding to rNDP reductase, with consequent depletion of the pools of dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. But is ADP the actual inhibitory species? In principle, inhibition could be brought about by the product, dADP, because deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates have been reported to act as rNDP reductase regulators under some conditions (19Cory J.G. Rey D.A. Carter G.L. Bacon P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12001-12007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This seems unlikely, because reaction rates were constant over the interval of each experiment (data not shown). Had dADP accumulation been responsible for the inhibition, then its progressive accumulation would be expected to progressively slow down the rates of ADP and GDP reduction. Moreover, the smallest amounts of dADP were formed in the reaction mixtures showing the greatest inhibition. Alternatively, if nucleoside diphosphate kinase were present in the reaction mixtures, the dADP formed could be converted to dATP. This possibility can be ruled out, first, because dATP accumulation would inhibit all four activities, not just those on purine substrates, and second, because our vaccinia R1 and R2 preparations have no detectable NDP kinase activity (which would have been detectable in our assay system). This can be seen from the data of Fig. 2, where the peak area for each dNTP tested as an allosteric modifier corresponds closely to the concentration added to the reaction mixture at time zero. Had NDP kinase been present, the amounts of dNTPs would have increased over the time of incubation. The ability to detect a number of potential contaminating enzyme activities represents an additional strength of the four-substrate assay procedure. Although limited, the data suggest that inhibition of ADP and GDP reduction at high rNDP concentrations is brought about by ADP itself. This was tested in the experiment shown in Fig. 5, in which the concentration of ADP alone was varied in the presence of constant amounts of CDP (50 μm) and GDP (100 μm). CDP reduction was unaffected over the ADP concentration range tested (50–600 μm), whereas the reduction of both purine nucleotide substrates was substantially inhibited. We have not yet asked directly whether GDP is inhibitory, but if both ADP and GDP are inhibitors, the data shown in Fig. 4 suggest that the effect of ADP is considerably more pronounced. From the above, it is clear that an important goal is to learn whether rNDP reductase inhibition by ADP is a general regulatory feature of this enzyme, by carrying out kinetic experiments of the kind described here with a mammalian form of the enzyme. As noted earlier, the vaccinia virus enzyme represents a good model for the mammalian RNR. We had an opportunity to test this concept further, because of the availability of mouse R2 pro"
https://openalex.org/W1964953277,"Hydroxyurea inhibits DNA synthesis by destroying the catalytically essential free radical of class I ribonucleoside diphosphate (rNDP) reductase, thereby blocking the <i>de novo</i>synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. In mammalian cells, including those infected by vaccinia virus, hydroxyurea treatment causes a differential depletion of the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools, suggesting that the activities of rNDP reductase are differentially sensitive to hydroxyurea. In the presence of different substrates and allosteric modifiers, we measured rates of free radical destruction in the vaccinia virus-coded rNDP reductase, by following absorbance at 417 nm as a function of time after hydroxyurea addition. Also, we followed enzyme activity directly, by using a recently developed assay that allows simultaneous monitoring of the four activities, in the presence of substrates and effectors at concentrations that approximate the intracellular environment. We found the primary determinant of radical loss to be not the ensemble of allosteric ligands bound but the activity of the enzyme. Nucleoside triphosphate effectors accelerated radical decay, compared with rates seen with the free enzyme. Adding substrate to the holoenzyme, under conditions where the enzymatic reaction is proceeding, further accelerated radical decay. Alternative models are discussed, to account for selective depletion of purine nucleotide pools by hydroxyurea."

The existence of multiple forms of arginase in eukaryotes suggests a complex regulatory role for this enzyme in the metabolism, development, and maintenance of these organisms. The mammalian liver arginase is well characterized (1Beruter J. Colombo J.P. Bachmann C. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Hirsch-Kolb H. Greenberg D.M. J.

The liver protein is immunologically distinct from extrahepatic arginases with the exception of the rat submaxillary gland arginase (3Jenkinson C.P. Grody W.W. Cederbaum S.D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 114: 107-132Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar,6Glass R.D. Knox W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5785-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hepatic enzyme functions as an essential component of the urea cycle, catalyzing the hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine and urea. The existence of a urea cycle is thought to keep ammonia levels low, preventing toxicity in ureotelic organisms by excreting excess nitrogen as urea, a neutral water-soluble molecule. It has been argued that the urea cycle maintains pH homeostasis by the coordinate removal of bicarbonate and ammonium ions (7Atkinson D. Bourke E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 297-302Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Atkinson D.E. Physiol. Zool. 1991; 65: 243-267Crossref Google Scholar). In Neurospora crassa and other microbial organisms that do not have a urea cycle, the products of arginase, ornithine, and urea, allow utilization of arginine as a nitrogen source. Ornithine can serve as a precursor for proline and glutamate as well as polyamine synthesis, whereas urea can provide NH3 via urease (9Davis R.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 280-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the extrahepatic mammalian arginases could provide precursors for proline, glutamate, and polyamines. Recent experiments with the newly cloned human extrahepatic arginase (AII) suggest a role in down-regulation of nitric oxide synthesis (10Gotoh T. Sonoki T. Nagasaki A. Terada K. Takiguchi M. Mori M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The cloning of three nonhepatic arginases in Xenopus laevis, and the demonstration of their differential expression during metamorphosis, is further evidence for a non-urea cycle role for arginase (11Patterton D. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25328-25334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise function of these extrahepatic arginases has not yet been defined. The fact that several prokaryotic organisms have arginase implies that the hepatic enzyme arose from a protein with a function or functions different from the mammalian urea cycle. When arginase was purified from N. crassa, it migrated as a 36-kDa peptide during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).1Western blot analysis with polyclonal antibodies raised against the 36-kDa peptide recognized two major immunoreactive forms, 41 and 36 kDa, in a wild-type strain (12Borkovich K.A. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7081-7086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Borkovich K.A. Weiss R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5510-5517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The larger form was produced by mycelia growing in arginine-supplemented medium. Peptide mapping of the two N. crassa arginase proteins yielded similar peptide maps, suggesting that the two species have similar amino acid sequences. Since both forms were absent in an aga mutant strain which is unable to utilize arginine as the sole nitrogen source, it was suggested that this locus may either regulate or encode both species of arginase (12Borkovich K.A. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7081-7086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arginase is found throughout the primary kingdoms of life. It has been postulated that all arginases are derived from a universal common ancestor before the divergence into archaea, eubacteria, and eukarya (14Ouzounis C.A. Kyrpides N.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the metabolic roles of two major arginases from N. crassa could provide insight into this evolutionary branch point where the primordial arginase evolved into an essential component of the urea cycle. We describe the cloning and characterization of the structural gene for arginase and the relationship between the two forms of arginase and theaga locus. We show that the aga locus produces two transcripts, 1.4- and 1.7-kb, from tandem promoters which are translated into two proteins: 36 and 41 kDa, respectively. Expression is regulated by arginine through mechanisms not yet understood. Both forms of arginase appear to be localized exclusively in the cytosol. Interestingly, the hepatic and nonhepatic arginases in mammals are encoded by separate genes, whereas the two N. crassaarginases are differentially expressed from a single locus. Possible roles for multiple forms of arginase in N. crassa are discussed. A standard N. crassa wild-type, 74-OR23-1A (LA1), and arginaseless mutants aga, allele UM913 (LA185), and aga his-3, alleles UM913 and 1–234-1438 (LA787), were used for all experiments unless otherwise noted. N. crassastrains FGSC 4411–4430 were used for RFLP mapping and were obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City. The E. coli strains DH5α and TG1 were used for plasmid amplification, and RZ1032 and CJ236 were used for preparing uracil-containing plasmid DNA. When replicating plasmids in E. coli, strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). N. crassastrains were grown at 30 °C in Vogel's minimal medium (VM) with 1.5% sucrose as the carbon source (16Vogel H.J. Am. Nat. 1964; 98: 435-446Crossref Google Scholar). Where indicated, medium was supplemented with 1 mm arginine (VMA), 1 mmhistidine (VMH), or NH4NO3 was replaced with 5 mm arginine (VA) as the sole nitrogen source. Liquid cultures were inoculated with 106 conidia per ml of medium in baffled flasks and shaken at 250 rpm in a New Brunswick gyrotory shaker (Model 76). Arginase was purified from the wild-type strain by a modification of a previously described procedure (12Borkovich K.A. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7081-7086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The modifications were limited to the type of resins used in column chromatography: (a) salt gradient chromatography was performed using a Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.); (b) chromatofocusing was performed using a PBE 94 (Pharmacia) column; and (c) hydroxyapatite column chromatography was performed on a 0.75 × 10 cm hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column. Arginase protein was cleaved with cyanogen bromide (CNBr), and the resulting peptides were fractionated and prepared for microsequencing (17LeGendre N. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Approximately 100 μg of arginase protein was incubated in 200 μl of 70% formic acid containing 200 μg of CNBr at room temperature under nitrogen and away from any light source. After 24 h, the reaction was diluted 10-fold with water and lyophilized. The resulting peptides were fractionated by SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in CAPS buffer (10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11) at 0.15 A for 4 h. The amino-terminal sequences from 5- and 12-kDa peptide fragments were determined at the UCLA Protein Sequencing Facility. Degenerate primers representing the amino acid sequences obtained from the CNBr-cleaved arginase peptides were synthesized (see Fig. 1 A). Polymerase chain reactions performed on N. crassa genomic DNA as a template (strain LA1), consisted of 3 cycles (92 °C for 60 s, 50 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 30 s) followed by 27 cycles (92 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s). The 261-bp PCR product was cloned and identified as a portion of the arginase structural gene by analysis of the nucleotide sequence. The PCR product was used as a probe to identify a 2.4-kbApaI-PstI DNA fragment from a genomic DNA cosmid library pMOcosX (19Orbach M.J. Sachs M.S. Yanofsky C. J. Biol.

Poro E.B. Yanofsky C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2452-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from approximately 1 g (wet weight) of mycelia as follows: mycelia, 4 g of glass beads, 3.5 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and 3.5 ml of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) were vortexed for 3–4 min in a 30-ml Corex tube and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min; the aqueous phase was extracted 3 times in this manner until the interface after centrifugation was clear of any debris. Nucleic acids were precipitated with 0.3 m NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol at 0 °C. Poly(A) RNA was isolated using a previously reported protocol (21Sachs M.S. David M. Werner S. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 869-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNAs were fractionated by gel electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (MSI Magna Graph) by capillary transfer using 10 × SSC (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J.

The baked membranes were prehybridized in 0.5 m NaH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS at 65 °C for 2–4 h. Hybridization with the random-primed 32P-labeled 2.4-kbApaI-PstI fragment from pAAP (Fig. 1 B) was carried out overnight (24Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein G. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar). Membranes from Southern analyses were washed twice at 65 °C with 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS for 15 min and twice at 65 °C with 0.2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS for 15 min before autoradiography. Membranes from Northern analyses were washed twice for 10 min at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS and once for 10 min at room temperature and 3 times for 5–10 min at 65 °C with 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS. RFLP mapping of the cloned arginase gene was performed as described by Metzenberg et al. (25Metzenberg R.L. Stevens J.N. Selker E.U. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2067-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Genomic DNAs from Oak Ridge and Mauriceville parental strains (FGSC 4411 and FGSC 4416) were digested with various restriction enzymes and subjected to Southern analysis using a 1.5-kb SalI-PstI fragment as a probe (Fig. 1 B). This fragment contains most of the coding region and an additional 0.35-kb of the 3′-untranslated sequences. A polymorphism was detected for HindIII restriction fragment lengths. Southern analysis was then performed usingHindIII-digested genomic DNA from the parental strains and 18 of their progeny. Restriction fragments within pAGA (Fig. 1 B) were subcloned and their sequences were determined manually by the dideoxy chain termination method (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52237) Google Scholar) using Sequenase Version 2.0 according to the manufacturer's recommendations (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The plasmid, pAAP, which contains theaga coding region and 500 bases of the 5′ upstream region, was sequenced on both strands (Fig. 2). Nucleotide sequence analysis and protein sequence comparisons were performed with the aid of version 7 of the Genetics Computer Group programs (Madison, WI) on a VAX computer. Data base searches were performed using the BLAST network services at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Lipmap D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68281) Google Scholar). The 2398-bp nucleotide sequence of the ApaI-PstI fragment containing the arginase gene has been listed in GenBank/EMBL data bases under accession number L20687. Approximately 1 g of semi-dry mycelia was vortexed vigorously with 3 g of glass beads in 3 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm arginine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 3 min on ice. The homogenized mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for protein and arginase assays. For Western analysis, proteins were fractionated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in CAPS buffer at 0.15 A for 4 h. Immunological detection using anti-arginase serum diluted 1:4000 (12Borkovich K.A. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7081-7086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham). Protein was quantitated by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211805) Google Scholar) with the Bio-Rad protein reagent concentrate microassay technique. Bovine serum albumin served as a protein standard. Arginase was assayed by the method reported in Ref. 29Davis R.H. Mora J. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 97: 383-388Crossref Google Scholar, and urea was quantitated by the method of Archibald (30Archibald R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 157: 507-518Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Typically, 10 μg of total protein extract was used to perform arginase assays. Approximately 100 pmol of synthetic oligonucleotides, PEB3: 3′-GGCATCCGAAGAGGCCGCCG-5′ (complementary to nucleotide sequence +158 to +177 bp in Fig. 2), and PEB4: 3′-AGAAACATTGTGGATGATGC-5′ (complementary to nucleotide sequence −151 bp to −132 bp in Fig. 2), were end-labeled in a 20-μl reaction volume with T4 polynucleotide kinase as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Approximately 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was incubated with 1 pmol of 32P-labeled primer at 65 °C for 5 min and then placed on ice for 5 min. The reaction mixture was buffered in reverse transcriptase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm spermidine) containing 5 units of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and adjusted to 200 μm dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP in a final volume of 10 μl. The mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The products of the reaction were analyzed on 6% acrylamide sequencing gels. Mutations that selectively modified the three in-frame ATGs at positions +1, +70, and +100 bp in the nucleotide sequence of the arginase gene (see Fig. 2) were introduced as described by Kunkel et al. (31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) and Carter (32Carter P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 382-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The template for mutagenesis was the 880-bp insert of pAAS (Fig. 1 B), which was cloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) or M13BM20 RF (Boehringer Mannheim). Mutagenesis with pBS II KS clones was carried out according to Kunkel et al. (31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) but the M13BM20 RF mutagenesis was modified as follows: 70 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) was used in the kinase reaction buffer: polyethylene glycol 8000/ammonium acetate was substituted for polyethylene glycol 8000/NaCl; 200 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl was used for annealing, and the extension buffer was altered (17.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 3.75 mm MgCl2, 21.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.75 mm ATP, 0.4 mm dNTPs). The nucleotide sequences of the oligonucleotides used to alter the first, second, and third ATG codons were: OMA1, 5′-GAGGGAGGGAAATATTAGCAAAGAA-3′; OMA2, 5′-CCTGGTTTTTGGATTATTGGTGCCTT-3′; and OMA3, 5′-TTGGGGAAGACAGGCCGAAAGTGTTG-3′ (modified nucleotides are in bold). The OMA1 oligonucleotide introduces a SspI site that allowed rapid screening by restriction analysis. Double-stranded DNA from the Phagemid (Stratagene), where mutagenesis altered either the first ATG (M1), second ATG (M2), or second and third ATG (M2/M3), as well as single-stranded DNA from M13BM20 phage (Boehringer Mannheim), where mutagenesis altered the first ATG (M1) or the third ATG (M3) were sequenced for confirmation of the desired mutations. The M2/M3 construct had two additional nucleotide changes; an A at −46 was changed to a T and a C at −41 was altered to an A. Constructs were made with the 880-bp fragment from pAAS with the altered M1, M2, M3, or M2/M3 which targeted the altered DNA to the his-3 locus or allowed for random genomic integration. The random integration constructs were done as follows: ApaI linearized pAAP (Fig. 1 B) was subjected to SalI partial digestion generating a 4.4-kb fragment containing the wild-type aga gene lacking the 880-bp ApaI-SalI fragment; the latter was replaced with the mutated 880-bp ApaI-SalI DNAs yielding pAAPM1, pAAPM2, and pAAPM2/M3. Constructs for targeting to thehis-3 locus were made using M13 clones. The wild-type 600-bpBamHI-SalI fragment was removed from pAAP (Fig. 1 B) using a partial double digest with BamHI and SalI and replaced with the BamHI-SalI fragment containing the M1* mutation. The M3 mutation was cloned byApaI-SalI replacement. The resulting constructs, pAAPM1* and pAAPM3, were cloned into a his-3 targeting vector pRAUW122 (33Aramayo R. Metzenberg R. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1995; 43: 9-13Google Scholar) as follows: the 2.1-kbBamHI-PstI fragment in pAXP (Fig. 1 B) was replaced with the BamHI-PstI fragment from pAAPM1*; the resulting plasmid pAXPM1* was cloned into theEcoRI-XbaI sites of pRAUW122 resulting in pAXPM1*122. The M3 targeted construct, pAAPM3122, was made by cloning the ApaI-PstI fragment from pAAPM3 into theApaI-PstI sites of pRAUW122. Conidial protoplasts from N. crassa aga mutant strain LA185 were co-transformed with 1 μg of DNA from each mutant construct made for random integration and 0.1 μg of the E. coli hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hph) from plasmid pMP6. Transformation was done as described by Vollmer and Yanofsky (34Vollmer S.J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4869-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Selection forhph + transformants was made on plates containing 150 μg/ml hygromycin in the bottom agar. Conidial protoplasts from mutant strain LA787, aga his-3, were transformed using 1.0 μg of pAXPM1*122 DNA; this construct carries the distal portion of the wild-type his-3 gene which is targeted to thehis-3 locus. Recombination at the his-3 locus restores prototrophy. Transformation of LA787 with pAAPM3122 used the same mode of selection, but was performed by electroporating fresh condia with 2.0 μg of DNA according to Vann (35Vann D.C. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1995; 42A: 53Google Scholar) with modifications by Ivey et al. (36Ivey F.D. Hodge P.N. Turner G.E. Borkovich K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1283-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Hygromycin-resistant transformants and positive prototrophs were assayed for arginase activity. All positives were purified to homokaryons by three cycles of single conidial isolation. Transformants Tm1, Tm2, Tm3, and Tm2/Tm3 were used for characterization experiments and will be described under “Results.” Extracts were fractionated from LA1 grown in VMA and VA medium at 30 °C for 20 h. Crude nuclei were isolated according to Hautala et al. (37Hautala J.A. Conner B.H. Jacobson J.W. Patel G.L. Giles N.H. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 704-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications as reported by Orbach et al. (20Orbach M.J. Poro E.B. Yanofsky C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2452-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The crude nuclear pellet was further purified by the procedure of Grove and Marzluf (38Grove G. Marzluf G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 463-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial and vacuolar fractionation were by the method of Cramer et al. (39Cramer C.L. Ristow J.L. Paulus T.J. Davis R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with modifications reported in Zerez et al. (40Zerez C.R. Weiss R.L. Franklin C. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8877-8882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several stratagies were used to clone the structural gene for N. crassaarginase. Hybridization with the heterologous probe, CAR1from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (41Sumrada R.A. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or with degenerate oligonucleotide probes designed from known arginase sequences were unsuccessful. Amino-terminal sequencing of purified arginase from strain LA1 was not possible because the NH2 terminus is blocked. Alteration of the purification protocol to delete the heat step did not affect blocking of the NH2 terminus. Therefore, the purified protein was used to generate peptide fragments for determining internal amino acid sequences; arginase was cleaved with cyanogen bromide (CNBr), and amino acid sequences were determined from two of the peptide fragments. The sequences showed strong similarities with two separate domains of arginase sequences from rat liver, human liver (42Kawamoto S. Amaya Y. Murakami K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Kobayashi K. Saheki T. Kimura S. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6280-6283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Amaya Y. Kawamoto S. Matsuda I. Mori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This oriented peptide fragments within the arginase protein. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers, which incorporated the codon bias observed for N. crassa genes, were synthesized based on the peptide sequences. A schematic representation of the nucleotide sequence and the position of the primers is shown in Fig. 1 A. A PCR using N. crassa genomic DNA as a template, amplified a unique 261-bp DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment revealed a single open reading frame. The putative amino acid sequence was identical to the arginase peptide sequences, demonstrating that the DNA fragment was derived from the arginase structural gene. The PCR product was then used to probe a N. crassa genomic DNA library, pMOcosX (19Orbach M.J. Sachs M.S. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10981-10987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe hybridized to cosmid G18:H4 (plate G18, column H, number 4). Restriction and nucleotide sequence analysis of portions of the cosmid revealed that it contained the coding region for arginase but little of the the upstream sequence. Therefore, an 1.8-kbEcoRI-PstI DNA fragment encoding arginase from cosmid G18:H4 was used to identify a second cosmid, X13:G10, from the same genomic cosmid DNA library. Southern analysis of cosmid X13:G10 identified a 5.5-kb PstI fragment which contained the desired gene. The sequence of this fragment showed that it contained the complete coding region for arginase and approximately 3.3 kb of the 5′ upstream region. This fragment was subcloned into pBluescript II KS to generate plasmid pAGA (Fig. 1 B). A 2.4-kbApaI-PstI fragment was further subcloned from pAGA to generate pAAP. This fragment was sequenced on both strands (Fig. 2). N. crassachromosomes have been marked on the basis of the segregation patterns of RFLPs for cloned genomic DNA sequences. These patterns have been recorded for a set of 18 progeny derived from a cross of Oak Ridge and Mauriceville parental strains (25Metzenberg R.L. Stevens J.N. Selker E.U. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2067-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The 261-bp PCR product was used as a probe in mapping the arginase gene. DNAs from two parent strains were digested with different restriction enzymes. The hybridization patterns for several of Oak Ridge restriction digests were different from Mauriceville digests identifying arginase gene-specific RFLPs. Since the polymorphism was most pronounced in HindIII digests, genomic DNA from the two parental strains and 18 progeny from a mating of the two strains was digested with HindIII and subjected to Southern analysis. The segregation pattern of the RFLP for the cloned gene matched exactly the pattern of theun-10 locus (see Table I) located on the right arm of linkage group VII. The aga locus maps to the right arm of linkage group VII, close to the un-10 locus (2 centimorgans from wc-1, 24 centimorgans fromarg-10). This places the ar"

A great deal of research is currently focused on the development of small synthetic peptides that mimic the biological activity of natural proteins. Small peptides offer a variety of advantages as therapeutic agents. Their small size facilitates absorption compared with large proteins (1Pappenheimer, J. R., Dahl, C. E., Karnovsky, M. L., and Maggio, J. E. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1942–1945Google Scholar), and they are more easily synthesized and, thus, less expensive to develop as therapeutic agents. Examples of successful small peptide drugs include anti-microbial agents (2Merrifield R.B. Jurradi P. Andreu D. Ubach J. Boman A. Boman H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3449-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), competitive inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (3Carmona A.K. Juliano L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and of the EPO receptor (4Wrighton N.C. Farrell F.X. Chang R. Kashyap A.K. Barbone F.P. Mulcahy L.S. Johnson D.L. Barrett R.W. Jolliffe L.K. Dower W.J. Science. 1996; 273: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), and immunogenic agents (5Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. van Regenmortel M.H.

Sutton B.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). With the number of published three-dimensional protein structures increasing, rational drug design based on molecular recognition may find its most direct application in the development of peptide mimetics. One of the chief obstacles to the use of therapeutic peptide mimetics is their susceptibility to proteolysis (7Lasdun A. Orlowski M.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 1989; 251: 439-447PubMed Google Scholar). To address this problem, some research has been directed toward the development ofd-amino acid peptide mimetics, which are resistant to proteolytic degradation (8Chorev M. Shavitz R. Goodman M. Minick S. Guillemin R. Science. 1979; 204: 1210-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This resistance stems from the highly site-specific recognition required for protease binding (9Dintzis H.M. Symer D.E. Dintzis R.Z. Zawadzke L.E. Berg J.M. Proteins. 1993; 16: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For example, a synthetic human immunodeficiency virus protease composed exclusively of d-amino acids can cleaved-peptide substrates but not l-peptide substrates (10Milton R.C. Milton S.C. Kent S.B. Science. 1992; 256: 1445-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Similarly, the l-amino acid version of the protease cleaves l-peptides but not d-peptides. Unfortunately, the promise of this approach is compromised by the fact that relatively few d-amino acid peptides possess biological activity. Ironically, it is likely that the vice ofd-peptides arises from their virtue; although proteases cannot recognize these peptides, neither can intended target proteins. A promising solution to the d-peptide conundrum was proposed by Chorev et al. (8Chorev M. Shavitz R. Goodman M. Minick S. Guillemin R. Science. 1979; 204: 1210-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), who suggested thatd-reverse peptides might have greater biological activity than d-peptides by more closely mimicking the side chain to main chain orientation of l-peptides (for example, see Fig. 1 B under “Results”). However, the efficacy of particular peptides synthesized as d or d-reverses is difficult to predict and must be determined empirically. The nuclear protein import pathway offers an appealing model system for analyzing the relative activities of chiral peptides. Nuclear proteins are imported into the nucleus through aqueous channels that span the nuclear envelope called nuclear pore complexes. Although ions and molecules less than ∼20–40 Da can diffuse passively through the nuclear pore complexes, larger proteins are transported by saturable pathways that are energy- and signal-dependent. The signals that specify nuclear protein import (NLSs)1 are commonly short stretches of amino acids rich in basic amino acid residues, although other classes of NLSs have been described recently (11Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 12Standiford D.M. Richter J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The initial step in the import of proteins containing basic amino acid-type NLSs occurs in the cytosol, where the NLS-containing proteins are bound to a receptor (variously called the NLS receptor, importin α, and karyopherin α (13Melchior F. Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The substrate-receptor complex then associates with the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complexes, and with the participation of other cytosolic factors, is transported through a gated channel in the nuclear pore complexes to the nuclear interior. The in vivo events of NLS-mediated nuclear import can be duplicated in an in vitro system using digitonin-permeabilized cells supplemented with cytosolic extracts and ATP (14Adam S.A. Lobl T.J. Mitchell M.A. Gerace L. Nature. 1989; 337: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Transport in this in vitro assay is blocked by the same inhibitors that block in vivo import, is rapid, and is easily quantified. Several properties of basic amino acid-type NLSs make them particularly suitable for chiral analysis. The minimal length required for activity is conveniently small (6 to 10 amino acids), and they retain their nuclear targeting function when synthesized as discrete peptides and chemically coupled to carrier proteins such as BSA. The target receptors are apparently forgiving, for other than a preponderance of basic amino acids, neither the precise number nor sequence of amino acids defines a consensus required for function. For example, in the case of the prototypical basic amino acid-type NLS found in the SV40 large T antigen, only the second lysine in a continuous stretch of five basic amino acids is absolutely required for function (15Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). The NLS receptors for basic amino acid-type NLSs comprise a group of several proteins containing a central core of eight degenerate armadillo-type repeats of 42 amino acids flanked by N- and C-terminal nonrepeat regions (16Yano R. Oakes M. Tabb M. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6880-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although their precise role is unknown, the NLS binding site appears to occur within these multiple armadillo repeats. The fact that the receptors for basic amino acid-type NLSs can functionally interact with a broad range of different sequences encouraged us to believe that chiral variants of this signal might be active in nuclear import. In this study, we have examined the effect of chirality on NLS function using an in vitro nuclear import assay with synthetic peptide conjugates. We have found that the basic amino acid-type NLS of the c-Myc protein is functional in bothl- and d-forward and reverse configurations. Although the l configurations are proteolyzed in a cytosolic extract of cells, the d configuration is protease-resistant. This work presents results useful for functional studies of NLS-mediated transport and therapeutic applications and provides insight for understanding the nature of NLS ligand-receptor binding interactions. The peptide-BSA conjugates used as transport substrates were prepared as described in Adam et al. (17Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The activated BSA-FITC was mixed with 1 mg of either the l-forward,l-reverse, d-forward, or d-reverse NLS peptide and incubated overnight at 4°C. Peptide concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry absorbance at 205 and 214 and normalized. The recombinant import factors used to reconstitute import were 200 nm importin α, 200 nm importin β, 200 nm NTF2, and 1 μm Ran with 1% BSA in transport buffer. Nuclear protein import in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells was carried out as described by Adamet al. (17Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J.

The activated BSA-FITC was mixed with 1 mg of either the l-forward, l-reverse,d-forward, or d-reverse NLS peptide and incubated overnight at 4°C. Peptide concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry absorbance at 205 and 214 and added to BSA-FITC at normalized levels. Synthesis of peptides was carried out manually by established solid-phase synthesis protocol (19Schnoltzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) on either (4-(hydroxymethyl) phenyl)-methyl ort-butoxycarbonyl-S-aminoacyl (20Canne L.E. Walker S.M. Kent S.B.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 1217-1220Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) resins. Coupling was monitored by quantitative ninhydrin assay (21Kent S.B.H. Ann Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 957-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Upon completion the final peptides were deprotected, cleaved, and purified by standard procedures (21Kent S.B.H. Ann Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 957-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking of NLS peptides to importin was carried out as described by Adam et al. (14Adam S.A. Lobl T.J. Mitchell M.A. Gerace L. Nature. 1989; 337: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and monitored by autoradiography on Kodac XAR film. 1 mg of l-forward,d-forward, l-reverse, and d-reverse c-Myc NLS peptide was dissolved in 100 μl of cytosol transport buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate. 50 μl of this solution was mixed with 20 μl of purified HeLa cytosol, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C. Degradation of the NLS was monitored by analytical reversed phase HPLC with a gradient of 0–67% solution B in solution A over 30 min (solution A = 100% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solution B = 90% acetonitrile, 10% water, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid). Isolated peaks were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to determine their identity. A schematic diagram depicting the chiral relationships betweenl- and d-forward and reverse peptides is shown in Fig. 1 A. This figure illustrates the close structural similarity between thel-forward and d-reverse peptides. To investigate whether d-reverse peptides are biologically active as NLSs, we initially compared the nuclear import activity of ad-reverse peptide based on the SV40 T antigen NLS with its natural (l) counterpart (sequence shown in Fig. 1 B). An l-reverse peptide based on the SV40 T antigen NLS has previously been shown to be largely inactive. For this analysis, fluorescent BSA-peptide conjugates were prepared and analyzed in a permeabilized cell assay for nuclear protein import. Although the wild type SV40 NLS peptide conjugate had the expected high level of nuclear import activity, the d-reverse peptide conjugate was essentially inactive (data not shown). We reasoned that the lack of activity in the d-reverse peptide conjugate could be due to the presence of a proline in the SV40 T antigen NLS. This is because proline, unlike other amino acids, forms a covalent bond with the main chain and is not topologically equivalent with respect to the N terminus in the forward and reverse directions. Most documented basic amino acid-type NLSs have a proline that closely flanks the core of basic residues (22Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 193-227PubMed Google Scholar), presumably to contribute to some contextual structure in the folded proteins. However, the c-Myc NLS without its proline is known to have activity comparable with the SV40 signal (23Dang C.V. Lee W.M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1988; 8: 4048-4054Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar,24Chelsky D. Ralph R. Jonak G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2487-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Based upon these data, we decided to explore the chiral properties of the c-Myc NLS. We synthesized the c-Myc NLS sequence in all four homochiral peptide orientations: all l-amino acids, all d-amino acids, all l-amino acids synthesized in reverse, and alld-amino acids synthesized in reverse (Fig. 1 A). These four peptides were coupled to FITC-conjugated BSA at an average ratio of five peptides/BSA molecule (as estimated by a size shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), and the conjugates (at 100 mm) were tested for their activity in the permeabilized cell import assay. To our surprise, all four c-Myc peptide-BSA conjugates were transported into the nucleus at similar levels as seen by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2 A). The transport of these peptide conjugates occurred at a level comparable with a BSA conjugate containing the SV40 T antigen NLS coupled to BSA at a similar level (Fig. 2 A). Quantitative analysis of the nuclear import of the c-Myc conjugates by flow cytometry (18Paschal B. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) confirmed that all four conjugates were virtually identical in their transport activity and equivalent in activity to the SV40 T antigen conjugate (Fig. 2 B). Control (not shown) experiments demonstrated that the nuclei of the permeabilized cells were almost all intact, as shown by their ability to exclude trypan blue (which is too large to diffuse into intact nuclei), and thus, the conjugates are unable to enter the nucleus by a nonphysiological diffusion route. Furthermore, nuclear accumulation of all four c-Myc conjugates was blocked by well characterized inhibitors of NLS-mediated nuclear import, including incubation at 0 °C (l- and d-reverse conjugates shown in Fig. 2 B; others not shown), depletion of ATP with hexokinase/glucose, and addition of GTPγS to the medium (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that the nuclear import of the c-Myc conjugates occurs by a physiological pathway (13Melchior F. Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We performed competition experiments to investigate whether these substrates enter the nucleus by the same pathway as the SV40 T antigen NLS. For this experiment, import assays with fluorescently labeled BSA coupled with the SV40 T antigen NLS were carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled c-Myc peptide-BSA conjugates. We chose to use BSA-NLS conjugates rather than free peptides because they are more efficient competitors (25Michaud N. Goldfarb D.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), perhaps due to an increased avidity for receptor or because tethering of the NLS peptide at one end constrains its conformations to those more appropriate for receptor recognition. Although uncoupled BSA alone had little effect on import, each of the four chiral c-Myc-BSA conjugates competed with the import of the SV40 T antigen NLS conjugate, as seen both by fluorescence staining (Fig. 3 A) and by flow cytometry (Fig. 3 B). The level of import competition with various unlabeled c-Myc peptide conjugates was similar to the competition obtained with an SV40 T antigen NLS peptide conjugate. For example, in a separate experiment from that shown in Fig. 3, the SV40 T antigen and the c-Myc l peptide conjugates, both, gave approximately 50% competition when present at 20 mmconcentration. We reproducibly observed that the l-reverse version of the c-Myc NLS was a somewhat less effective competitor of T antigen NLS-mediated nuclear import than the other three chiral versions (Fig. 3 B). Note that the weaker activity of thel-reverse signal was not evident by fluorescence staining (Fig. 3 A), which is included only to show a gross correspondence to the more sensitive fluorescence-activated cell sorter assay. To directly examine whether the transport competition by the c-Myc NLS peptide conjugates was due to binding to the NLS receptor, we carried out peptide cross-linking and competition experiments to measure the NLS receptor interaction of these peptides. Free unconjugated 125I-labeled SV40 T antigen NLS peptide was incubated with a cytosolic fraction enriched in the NLS receptor 2S. Adam, personal communication. in the presence of a 200-fold excess of each of the four unlabeled c-Myc NLS peptides (Fig. 4), followed by cross-linking of the radiolabeled peptide to bound protein with 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid and analysis of the products by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown previously (14Adam S.A. Lobl T.J. Mitchell M.A. Gerace L. Nature. 1989; 337: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we found that the SV40 T antigen NLS peptide was specifically cross-linked to the ∼55-kDa NLS receptor in this assay (Fig. 4, lane 1) and was strongly competed by the homologous unlabeled NLS peptide (data not shown). Each of the free c-Myc peptides also competed with radiolabeled SV40 T antigen NLS for cross-linking to the NLS receptor (Fig. 4, lanes 2–3 and 5–6), although thel-reverse c-Myc peptide was somewhat less effective than the other three chiral versions (Fig. 4). To verify that the c-Myc NLS peptide conjugates utilizing the known basic-type NLS receptor pathway, all four conjugates were incubated with permeabilized cells supplemented solely with the recombinant import factors importin α, importin β, NTF2, and Ran. These factors alone were sufficient to reconstitute the import of the c-Myc NLS peptide conjugates in vitro (Fig. 2 B).Figure 4All four chiral variants of the c-Myc NLS peptide compete for binding to the same receptor. SV40 NLS peptide was modified by the addition of a Tyr and labeled with125I. Reactions were carried out with either no competitor (1), or with l-forward (2),l-reverse (3), d-forward (4), or d-reverse (5) c-Myc peptides. The SV40 NLS peptide was incubated with phenyl-Sepharose-extracted HeLa cytosol in the presence or absence of 200-fold excess cold free peptide. The incubates were cross-linked with 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by autoradiography. The size of the labeled band is consistent with that of the NLS receptor. The space between lanes (3) and (4) is a lane to which no sample was added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the extent to which the d-forward andd-reverse peptides were proteolytically resistant in cytosol as compared with the l-peptides, we incubated each chiral variant of the c-Myc NLS as a free peptide in cytosol in the absence of protease inhibitors for varying times and analyzed the mixture by high performance liquid chromatography fractionation (Fig. 5). The peak corresponding to thel-peptide was degraded to a considerable extent by 15 min and was completely degraded at 4 h. By contrast, intactd-peptide was present at undiminished levels up to the longest time point tested (20 h). The high performance liquid chromatography fractions shown were taken at 1 min and 4 h for both the l-forward and d-reverse c-Myc. The later eluting l-forward peak is due to peptide dimer formation by a disulfide bond. This confirms that freel-forward peptides are quite susceptible to proteolytic degradation in cell cytosol. It also demonstrates that thed-peptide analogues of the c-Myc NLS would be useful as proteolytically resistant tools for therapeutic applications and for studies involving analysis of NLS function. Our data indicate that all four chiral variants of the c-Myc NLS are equally active as nuclear import directing signals when analyzed as BSA-peptide conjugates in a permeabilized cell nuclear import assay. Furthermore, all four peptide-BSA conjugates compete for the import pathway used by the SV40 T antigen NLS in vitro as shown by substrate competition experiments, and all four variants specifically bind to the same NLS receptor as demonstrated by cross-linking competition. The observation that recombinant import factors alone are sufficient to direct the import of all four chiral conjugates in permeabilized cells supports the notion that these chiral NLS peptides interact with the same import machinery utilized by the SV40 NLS. The fact the importin α supported import of these conjugates, combined with our cross-linking data, strongly suggest that importin α is the receptor responsible for the observed import of the four chiral conjugates. Since the d-reverse and d-forward forms of the c-Myc NLS are functionally active (like thel-forward peptide) but are proteolytically resistant (unlike the l-peptide), these d-form NLSs will provide effective tools for analyzing the pathway of nuclear importin vivo and in vitro, where they could serve as stable competitive inhibitors. This is especially significant given the marked sensitivity to degradation we observed for thel-forward peptides. The d-form NLSs also could prove useful for gene delivery applications (26Collas P. Husebye H. Alestrom P. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although the l-reverse peptide conjugate of the c-Myc NLS was as active as the other three chiral forms in nuclear import, this peptide was somewhat less active than the other three chiral peptides in competing with the SV40 T antigen NLS peptide conjugate for import and for cross-linking to the NLS receptor. It must be emphasized that each BSA molecule (on average) contained five NLS peptides, which were coupled to a heterogeneous range of sites that could influence the affinity of the immobilized NLS peptide for the NLS receptor (25Michaud N. Goldfarb D.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The rate of import could be determined by the highest affinity NLS site on a particular BSA molecule, whereas competition for import and peptide cross-linking would reflect an average affinity over the whole NLS population. It must be acknowledged that the diminished activity of the free l-reverse peptide during cross-linking could also be attributed to a lower resistance to proteolytic degradation. Although there is no strict consensus sequence for basic-type NLS signals, there appear to be certain requirements that govern their activity. Previous work together with our own suggests that in addition to the need for basic amino acids, subtle structural requirements for activity must also be satisfied. In the case of the SV40 NLS, the presence of a Lys at position 128 is absolutely required for activity (15Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). An extensive study probing the functional requirements of this signal using conservative substitutions at position 128 revealed that a single d-Lys placed within the context of an otherwisel-NLS significantly reduced activity (27Lanford R.E. White R.G. Dunham R.G. Kanda P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2722-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In light of our own observation that an NLS peptide made entirely ofd-amino acids is active, the disruptive effect of the above substitution suggests that the relative position of the charged side chains is important for activity and suggests that certain amino acid side chains must share the same relative orientation with respect to the main chain as their neighbors. Evidently, the activity of a NLS peptide depends less on absolute chirality than on the need for chiral uniformity. Our study also suggests, in agreement with other work, that topology, rather than simply positive charge, plays a role in recognition of NLS signals. The widely reported inactivity of the reverse SV40 NLS and our observed inactivity of the d-reverse SV40 NLS suggests that the presence of a structurally incongruous proline overrides simple charge interactions. Supporting this notion is the observation that even the position of the proline in an all l-forward NLS influences activity (28Makkerh J.P.S. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 6: 1025-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observed that ad-reverse SV40 NLS peptide with an alanine in place of the proline is an active NLS signal. 3A. C. S. Saphire, S. J. Bark, and L. Gerace, unpublished data. Brady and Dodson (29Brady L. Dodson G. Nature. 1994; 368: 692-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggest that prolines, in particular, may present a major obstacle to the widespread application of d-reverse technology. Unlike all the other natural amino acids, the proline side chain forms a covalent bond with the main chain. The resulting structure is not topologically equivalent in the forward and reverse directions. Anchoring the side chain to the main chain restricts the ϕ angle to −60°, which favors the formation of β turns, and for this reason, proline commonly occupies the i + 1 position in β turns. The presence of a proline may be particularly significant to the activity of NLS signals, since almost all identified basic-type NLS signals possess a flanking proline. Indeed, Chou Fasman predictions of 17 known nuclear and nucleolar sequences reveal a propensity to form turns (30Murakami M. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Crystallographic evidence that NLS sequences form turns via prolines can be seen in the 3-dimensional crystal structure of the human immunodeficiency virus matrix protein, where a proline plays a critical role in the formation of a loop structure that projects the NLS sequence above the plane of a surrounding β strand (31Massiah M.A. Starich M.R. Paschall C. Summers M.F. Christensen A.M. Sundquist W.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 198-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Although free NLS peptides probably lack secondary structure, the restricted conformation of proline may impart some structural character to these peptides that influences receptor binding. A rather general question arises from our study. How could the NLS receptor-mediated pathway recognize d-form peptides when they do not arise commonly in the intracellular environment? We suggest that the observed chiral promiscuity is a consequence of the fact that hundreds of different nuclear proteins must be accommodated by the NLS receptor-mediated import pathway. The NLS is usually located in an internal portion of the primary structure and must function without impinging upon the folding and functional requirements of the specific protein in which it resides. The compromise between the need for an easily recognized signal, and the need for that signal to be an integral part of structurally unrelated nuclear proteins necessitates the lack of consensus seen in NLS sequences. But this signal diversity presents a problem for receptor recognition. Since it would be too energetically expensive to produce a receptor that is tailor-made for each nuclear protein, we suggest that the signals are accommodated by a small group of fairly permissive receptors. Our study shows that this permissiveness extends to include signals whose chirality is entirely opposite to that of naturally occurring NLSs. By limiting signal recognition to a combination of charge and side chain topology, a few types of receptor could accommodate the plethora of structurally diverse proteins that must cross the nuclear envelope. Other intracellular signaling pathways that must process diverse proteins also exploit the use of signals with very loose consensus sequences, such as mitochondrial import (32Skerjanc I. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), endoplasmic reticulum translocation (33Kaiser C.A. Preuss D. Grisafi P. Botstein D. Science. 1987; 235: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and lysozomal import pathways (34Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Our study suggests thatd-forward and d-reverse peptides may also be functional in these pathways, although these alternate chiral versions have yet to be tested. The structure of the NLS receptor co-crystallized with these chiral peptides should help to reconcile the apparent paradox of a structurally discerning, yet chirally promiscuous system. We thank Dr. Stephen Kent for critical discussions and the technical support of his lab, in which the peptides were synthesized, Dr. Frauke Melchior, Dr. Bryce Paschal, and Dr. Tom Muir for their intellectual input, and Dr. Susie Lyman for her critical reading of the manuscript."

The insect fat body is a functional analogue of the vertebrate liver. Serving as a “protein factory” (1Wyatt G.R. Insect Biology of the Future. Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 201-225Google Scholar), it is the insect's most powerful secretory organ, responsible for production of virtually all hemolymph proteins (2Kanost M.R. Kawooya J.K.

The aptness of this biological analogy is further substantiated by the many parallels in regulatory mechanisms responsible for fat body- and liver-specific gene expression, which is governed by a combination of transcription factors synergistically interacting with regulatory elements in target genes. Indeed, the regulatory sequences of some fat body-specific genes and their liver-specific counterparts are highly conserved (3Falb D. Maniatis T.

Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4),1 a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a transcriptional activator for a wide variety of liver genes with diverse functions (10Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Transcriptional Regulation of Liver-specific Genes. R. G. Landes Co, Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar, 11Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Hopkins K. Sladek M. Mol. Cell.

Apart from directly regulating target genes, HNF-4 may trigger a cascade of transcription factors involved in appropriate expression of genes essential for liver function (10Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Transcriptional Regulation of Liver-specific Genes. R. G. Landes Co, Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar). For example, HNF-4 activates transcription of HNF-1, another important hepatocyte transcription factor (13Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 14Tian J.-M. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We are interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms of insect vitellogenesis. In the anautogenous mosquito Aedes aegypti, this process is initiated by a blood meal and involves the coordinated activity of two vitellogenic tissues: the fat body, which produces and secretes several yolk protein precursors, and the ovary, which specifically accumulates them (15Raikhel A.S. Adv. Dis. Vector Res. 1992; 9: 1-39Crossref Google Scholar). Vitellogenic events are regulated, at least in part, by the insect steroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). The expression of vitellogenic genes is mediated through a 20E-triggered regulatory cascade of transcription factors (16Raikhel, A. S., Miura, K., and Segraves, W. A. (1998)Am. Zoologist, in pressGoogle Scholar), similar to that in Drosophila development (17Ashburner M. Cell. 1990; 61: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A high degree of evolutionary conservation among HNF-4 sequences suggests that the mosquito homologue may be an important transcription factor in the fat body, as it is in the vertebrate liver. Indeed, vertebrate HNF-4 cloned from rat, mouse, Xenopus, and human (10Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Transcriptional Regulation of Liver-specific Genes. R. G.

Dev. 1994; 48: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Zhong W. Mirkovitch J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7276-7284Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or to their functional analogues in the Drosophila embryos: the fat body, midgut, and Malpighian tubules, respectively (23Zhong W. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the silk moth B. mori, HNF-4 expression was detected in most tissues of the larva and pharate adult, with highest expression in the gut, fat body, and gonads (24Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of three isoforms of mosquito HNF-4: AaHNF-4a, AaHNF-4b, and AaHNF-4c. Three distinct transcripts of 2.8 kb (AaHNF-4a), 2.1 kb (AaHNF-4b), and 1.8 kb (AaHNF-4c) were detected in adult mosquitoes, and their distribution is tissue- and stage-specific. The AaHNF-4a and AaHNF-4b isoforms are typical members of the HNF-4 subfamily, and their functionality has been confirmed by their ability to bind as homodimers to the cognate DNA recognition site. In the mosquito fat body, AaHNF-4b is predominant during the previtellogenic period and the synthetic phase of vitellogenesis, while AaHNF-4a is predominant during the termination phase. In the ovaries, only the AaHNF-4b transcript was detected throughout the entire vitellogenic period. A novel finding of this work is the cloning of a unique mosquito isoform AaHNF-4c; it is distinct from AaHNF-4b in that part of the A/B and the entire C (DNA-binding) domains are absent. The AaHNF-4c transcript appears most abundantly during the termination phase of vitellogenesis. The AaHNF-4c isoform prevented AaHNF-4a, AaHNF-4b, and rat HNF-4 from binding to DNA in EMSA, suggesting that this HNF-4 isoform may serve as a transcriptional repressor. Furthermore, in transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells, AaHNF-4c significantly reduced positive transcriptional activity of the human HNF-4α1 on the apolipoprotein CIII promoter (apo-CIIIP). In addition, we also have identified HNF-4 binding sites in the upstream region of two yolk protein precursor genes: vitellogenin (vg) (26Romans P. Tu Z. Ke Z. Hagedorn H.H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 939-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and vitellogenic carboxypeptidase (vcp) (27Deitsch K.W. Raikhel A.S. Insect Mol. Biol. 1993; 2: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are the major genes specifically expressed in the female fat body during vitellogenesis (15Raikhel A.S. Adv. Dis. Vector Res. 1992; 9: 1-39Crossref Google Scholar). Mosquitoes, A. aegypti, were reared according to Hays and Raikhel (28Hays A.R. Raikhel A.S. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1990; 199: 114-121Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Larvae were fed on a standard diet as described before (29Lea A.O. J. Med. Entomol. 1964; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Vitellogenesis was initiated by allowing females 3–5 days after eclosion to feed on an anesthetized white rat. The RNA ladder was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; Sequenase was from U. S. Biochemical Corp.; and restriction enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim. Perkin-Elmer was the source of reagents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and in vitro transcription and translation assays were from Promega. MSI CO supplied nitrocellulose-blotting membranes. Radionucleotides for labeling of probes and DNA sequencing were from NEN Life Science Products. All other reagents were of analytical grade from Sigma or Baker. A cDNA fragment of AaHNF-4 was first obtained by PCR, for which degenerate primers were designed based on the sequences of rat, mouse, and Drosophila HNF-4 (18Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 19Taraviras S. Monaghan A.P. Schutz G. Kelsey G. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Zhong W. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Amplification was achieved in a Perkin Elmer thermal cycler using as the template cDNA reverse-transcribed from 20 μg of total RNA prepared from the fat bodies of vitellogenic female mosquitoes. The PCR-generated fragment was used as a probe to screen a λZAPII cDNA library, which was prepared from the fat bodies of vitellogenic female mosquitoes 6–48 h post-blood meal (PBM) as previously reported (30Cho W.-L. Raikhel S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21823-21829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several positive cDNA clones were subsequently isolated and sequenced using standard protocols (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Analyses of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were performed using the software of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group. Total RNA was isolated from mosquitoes of different stages and tissues using the guanidine isothiocyanate method as described previously (32Bose S.G. Raikhel S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Polyadenylated mRNA was isolated using Biomag oligo(dT)20 magnetic beads and the manufacturer's protocols (PerSeptive Diagnostics, Inc.). For Northern blot analysis, total or poly(A)+ RNA was separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels in MOPS buffer, blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized to32P-labeled DNA probes under high stringency conditions (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Autoradiography was conducted at −70 °C using intensifying screens. The mosquito AaHNF-4a and -4b cDNAs were subcloned into the transcription vector pGEM.3Z (Promega) under the control of the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter. The mosquito AaHNF-4c isoform and the rat HNF-4 clone (a kind gift of Dr. F. Sladek) (18Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pBluescript, under the control of the T3 RNA polymerase promoter. The DmGATAb clone was a gift form Dr. T. Abel and was under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (33Abel T. Michelson A.M. Maniatis T. Development. 1993; 119: 623-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TNT System (Promega) was used for in vitro TNT of cDNA clones in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, utilizing the corresponding RNA polymerases. 1 μg of DNA was used in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. The TNT reactions were conducted at 30 °C for 2 h and then stored at −70 °C until needed for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 2–3 μl of the appropriate TNT sample, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 μg poly(dI-dC), 4% glycerol, and 5 pmol (100-fold molar excess) of competitor DNA when appropriate. After incubating for 15 min at room temperature, 0.05 pmol of 32P-labeled DNA probe was added, and the solution was incubated an additional 15 min. The samples were loaded on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (prerun for 1 h) in 0.5× TBE and run at 10 V/cm. The gel was then dried and autoradiographed with an intensifying screen at −70 °C. To initiate heterodimer formation between AaHNF-4c and other HNF-4 isoforms, the TNT samples were first mixed together and heated at 50 °C for 1 min and then cooled at room temperature for 15 min (34Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-7495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar,35Iyer S.B. Davis D.L. Seal S.N. Burch J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4863-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The volume was brought up to 20 μl in shift buffer, and the reaction was carried out as described above. Control incubations with each HNF-4 isoform without the addition of AaHNF-4c showed no or negligible reduction in specific binding due to heating. DNA probes for EMSA were made by annealing complementary oligonucleotides. The HNF-4 binding site (APF-1) (18, 36) in the apolipoprotein CIII gene was used as a positive control for binding. The oligonucleotides used to generate the APF-1 probe were: 5′-GCGCTGGGCAAAGGTCAC -3′ and 5′-GCAGGTGACCTTTGCCCAG-3′. The Vg HNF4 probe was made by annealing 5′-ATCGGGAGGCCAATGGTCGAG-3′ with 5′- GTCACTCGACCATTGGCCTCC, and the VCP HNF4 probe was composed of 5′- ATGCAAAGGGTCGTTAGGTCAAAT-3′ and 5′-ATCGATTTGACCTAACGACCCTTT-3′. The APF-1 probe was labeled by back-filling with Klenow fragment using [α-32P]dCTP, and the Vg and VCP HNF4 probes were labeled by back-filling with [α-32P]dATP. The BZIP-1 probe used as a nonspecific competitor and the Box-A probe used as a positive control for DmGATAb were described previously (37Dittmer N.T. Raikhel A.S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The AaHNF-4c cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of the expression vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen). Construction of the human HNF-4α1 expression vector and the luciferase reporter construct pL854, containing the apo-CIIIP, have been previously described (38Taylor D.G. Haubenwallner S. Leff T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2930-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were seeded at a density of 1.2 × 105 in 12-well tissue culture plates and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Each transfection contained 150 ng of pL854, 50 ng of pCMVβ-gal (CLONTECH), selected amounts of human HNF-4α1 and/or AaHNF-4c, and empty pcDNA 3.1 vector for a total of 5 μg of DNA. Cells were transfected in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies) at a DNA:LipofectAMINE ratio of 1:4. At 4 h after transfection, the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum for an additional 36 h. The human liver HepG2 cells were cultured as described previously (36Leff T. Reue K. Melian A. Culver H. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16132-16137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were determined by the Dual-Light reporter gene assay system (Tropix) using a Wallac-Berthold LB96P-2 luminometer. Putative clones encoding the mosquito HNF-4 transcription factor (AaHNF-4) were obtained by a combination of the PCR and cDNA library screening. The following strategy was used to design degenerate primers. The sense primer conformed to the P-box sequence of the DNA-binding domain, which is conserved among the members of the nuclear receptor superfamily; the antisense primer was based on the conserved sequence LDDQVA from the dimerization domain of rat, mouse, and Drosophila HNF-4 homologues (18Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 20Hata S. Inoue T. Kosuga K. Nakashima T. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Zhong W. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A 440-base pair fragment was amplified by PCR and sequenced as described under “Materials and Methods.” After confirming that its sequence was similar to that of rodent and Drosophila HNF-4 isoforms, it was used as a probe to screen a mosquito fat body cDNA library. Restriction mapping and sequence analyses of positive cDNA clones revealed three distinct mosquito cDNAs present in the library, which we designate AaHNF-4a, AaHNF-4b, and AaHNF-4c (Fig. 1). The AaHNF-4b (1.86 kb) and AaHNF-4c (1.53 kb) cDNAs share the same sequences at the 5′-terminus (except that the 5′-end of AaHNF-4c is 23 base pairs longer), whereas the AaHNF-4a (2.43-kb) cDNA has a different 5′-terminal sequence. All three AaHNF-4 cDNAs have the same 3′-end sequences and lack a poly(A) tail, indicating that none of the cDNAs represent a full-length transcript. However, AaHNF-4b has a canonical polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) followed by an additional 14 base pairs, while the AaHNF-4a and AaHNF-4c cDNA sequences end just before the position of the AATAAA site in AaHNF-4b. In all three cDNAs, the putative start codons (ATG) are preceded by several in-frame stop codons, indicating that the open reading frame is full-length in each clone. The conceptual translation of the AaHNF-4a, AaHNF-4b, and AaHNF-4c cDNAs shows that they encode three different proteins, or isoforms, of 565, 538, and 427 amino acids, respectively. The mosquito AaHNF-4a and AaHNF-4b isoforms exhibit a structural domain organization similar to that of the rodent and insect HNF-4 homologues (Fig. 2). The C (DNA-binding), D (hinge), and E (dimerization/ligand-binding) domains are highly conserved; for example, AaHNF-4a and AaHNF-4b share 89, 65, and 79% identity with the respective domains of Drosophila HNF-4 and 91, 58, and 72% identity with B. mori (Fig. 2). An N-terminal A/B and a C-terminal proline-rich F-domain, which possibly have a transactivator function (18Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), are poorly conserved in the mosquito AaHNF-4, a characteristic feature of all members of the HNF-4 subfamily and, more generally, the nuclear receptor superfamily (40Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6082) Google Scholar). A sequence comparison of AaHNF-4a and AaHNF-4b isoforms show that they encode nearly identical polypeptides, differing only in the amino acids at their N termini (Fig. 3), strikingly similar to the B. mori isoforms BmHNF-4a and BmHNF-4b. In contrast, the first six amino acids of the shortest isoform, AaHNF-4c, are identical to those of AaHNF-4b, but the rest of the A/B domain and the entire C (DNA-binding) domain are lacking (Fig. 3). The structure of the mosquito AaHNF-4c isoform is unique among insect and vertebrate members of the HNF-4 subfamily that have been reported to date. To determine if the three AaHNF-4 cDNAs we have cloned represent respective AaHNF-4 mRNA species in the mosquito, Northern hybridizations were performed using particular portions of the cDNAs as probes (Fig. 4); a probe common to all three cDNAs (Fig. 1, common) detected three transcripts of 2.8, 2.1, and 1.8 kb; a probe specific to the 5′-untranslated region of the AaHNF-4a cDNA (5′-HNF-4a, Fig. 1) hybridized only with the 2.8-kb transcript; and the last probe, containing sequences from the A/B and C domains common to the AaHNF-4a and AaHNF-4b cDNAs but not to the AaHNF-4c (Fig. 1, ΔC), recognized the 2.8- and 2.1-kb mRNAs but not the 1.8-kb mRNA. Thus, we differentiated the 2.8-, 2.1-, and 1.8-kb mRNA species as AaHNF-4a, AaHNF-4b, and AaHNF-4c transcripts, respectively (Fig. 4). This experiment verifies that one of the transcripts indeed lacks the region encoding for a portion of the A/B domain and the entire DNA-binding domain, and therefore, AaHNF-4c does not appear to be an artifact of the cDNA library. To further confirm the presence the AaHNF-4c transcript in the mRNA pool from the mosquito fat body, we performed reverse transcription-PCR using nondegenerate primers that flanked the missing region of AaHNF-4c. cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA extracted from the fat bodies of female mosquitoes at 36 h PBM. The sense and antisense primers were designed based on the 5′-untranslated region and hinge domain, respectively, common to both AaHNF-4b and AaHNF-4c cDNAs. Upon primary amplification by PCR, only a band of the expected size for AaHNF-4b was detected. However, when a secondary PCR was performed, a band of the expected size for AaHNF-4c was amplified. Southern blot analyses demonstrated that both bands hybridized with a probe specific to the hinge region of HNF-4 (data not shown). To determine the distribution of AaHNF-4 expression in tissues of adult mosquitoes, polyadenylated mRNA was isolated from the whole body of males and the fat body, midgut, Malpighian tubules, ovary, and thorax of females, taken at the middle stage of the vitellogenic cycle (24 h PBM) and subjected to Northern blot analysis. A fragment of the cDNA common to all three AaHNF-4 cDNAs (Fig. 1) was used as a hybridization probe. The mosquito fat body, Malpighian tubules, and midgut exhibited significant levels of AaHNF-4 transcription. Two mosquito HNF-4 isoforms (AaHNF-4a and AaHNF-4b) were detected in these tissues (data not shown). In contrast to the somatic tissues of mosquito females, only the 2.1-kb (AaHNF-4b) transcript was found in the ovaries (Fig. 5). The highest level of ovarian AaHNF-4b mRNA was detected soon after initiation of vitellogenesis by a blood meal (6 h PBM); it dropped to an undetectable level by 36 h PBM, the time of termination of vitellogenic events in the female mosquito (Fig. 5). The high level of conservation between the mosquito HNF-4 and its vertebrate counterparts (Figs. 2 and 3) as well as the presence of three AaHNF-4 transcripts in the adult fat body (Figs. 4 and 5) suggests that it plays an important role in this metabolic tissue, similarly to that of the vertebrate HNF-4 in the liver. In an attempt to further understand the possible functions of AaHNF-4 in the vitellogenic fat body of adult mosquitoes, we characterized its expression in more detail. Total RNA from the fat body of female mosquitoes at different stages of vitellogenesis was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization using the cDNA probe common to all three AaHNF-4 isoforms. The expression pattern of the three AaHNF-4 transcripts changed differentially over the course of the vitellogenic cycle (Fig. 6). In the previtellogenic stage, all three transcripts were clearly present during the first day posteclosion, but in subsequent days only the 2.1-kb transcript (corresponding to the AaHNF-4b isoform) was present. Furthermore, its levels increased by day 5 of the previtellogenic period. During the first 18 h of vitellogenic period, only the AaHNF-4b transcript was clearly detectable. At 24 h PBM, when yolk protein gene transcription is nearing its maximum (15Raikhel A.S. Adv. Dis. Vector Res. 1992; 9: 1-39Crossref Google Scholar), the levels of the AaHNF-4a transcript began to rise again, relative to AaHNF-4b, and the AaHNF-4c transcript appeared. By 36 h PBM, the levels of HNF-4 mRNA significantly increased; AaHNF-4a became the predominant form and AaHNF-4c more pronounced. This pattern of AaHNF-4 expression was maintained until 48 h PBM, when yolk protein synthesis terminated and the fat body returned to its previtellogenic state (15Raikhel A.S. Adv. Dis. Vector Res. 1992; 9: 1-39Crossref Google Scholar). We used EMSA to determine if the mosquito HNF-4 homologue is a functional DNA-binding protein. The three AaHNF-4 cDNAs were subcloned into transcription vectors and then subjected to TNT reactions in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The results of the TNT reaction were verified by utilizing [35S]methionine; SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses showed that the in vitro synthesized proteins closely corresponded to their expected molecular sizes (data not shown). The TNT expressed proteins were examined for their ability to form specific binding complexes with APF-1, a sequence previously shown to be a recognition site for both rat and insect HNF-4 factors (18Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 23Zhong W. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,24Swevers L. Iatrou K. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A rat HNF-4 clone was used as a positive control. The AaHNF-4a and AaHNF-4b proteins formed DNA-protein complexes of similar mobility, which migrated slower than the complex formed by the rat HNF-4 (Fig. 7). The binding of these proteins was sequence-specific and could be competed away with an excess of cold probe (APF-1) but not with a nonspecific competitor. The protein synthesized from the AaHNF-4c cDNA, which is missing the DNA-binding domain, failed to exhibit any binding activity (data not shown). An APF-1 binding complex of intermediate mobility was observed in the retardation gel when the AaHNF-4b isoform"
