https://openalex.org/W1525229364,"A protein kinase which phosphorylated histone and protamine was partially purified from bovine cerebellum. Casein and phosvitin were inert as substrates. The enzyme did not require any cyclic nucleotide. A sulfhydryl compound such as 2-mercaptoethanol, glutathione, or cysteine was necessary for the reaction. The optimum pH was 8.5 to 9.0 Km values for ATP and whole histone were 3.3 X 10(-6) M and 150 microgram/ml, respectively. The optimum concentration of Mg2+ varied with histone fractions employed; with H2B histone as substrate the enzyme was most active at 50 to 100 nM Mg2, whereas with H1 and H2A histones the maximum activity was observed at 5 to 10 mM Mg2+ and with H3 and H4 histones the enzyme was active over a range of 5 to 75 mM Mg2+. The enzyme phosphorylated Ser-32 and Ser-36 in H2B histone and Ser-38 in H1 histone, although the reaction with Ser-36 in H2B histone was very slow. The molecular weight was 6.4 X 10(4). The sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radium were about 4.5 and 29 A, respectively. The enzyme showed heterogeneity upon isoelectrofocusing electrophoresis with isoelectric points of 5.6, 6.0, and 6.6. The enzyme was not inhibited by protein inhibitor nor by the regulatory subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Preliminary analysis suggested that the enzyme was produced from its precursor protein by a limited proteolytic reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2024324623,"Our results demonstrate the existence of two initiation sites, S1 and S2, for transcription of the galactose operon of E. coli. Transcription from each of these sites responds to different regulatory mechanisms. In the presence of Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein (CRP) and cyclic AMP (cAMP), transcription initiates only at S1. In the absence of CRP or cAMP, transcription starts from S2. Examination of a gal promoter mutation shows that transcription from S1 is abolished, but that initiation can occur at S2 and is still subject to repression by CRP-cAMP. In vivo gal expression from this mutant promoter is actually increased when cyclic AMP or CRP are eliminated by mutations in the cya (adenylate cyclase) or crp genes. Studies of gal expression from a wild-type promoter in cya and crp mutants are also consistent with the use of the two startpoints in vivo and suggest that when CRP or cAMP is absent, transcription starts from S2 in vivo. S1 corresponds to the startpoint for CRP- and cAMP-dependent gal mRNA previously determined (Musso et al., 1977). S2 precedes S1 by 5 base pairs in the DNA of the gal regulatory region. A heptamer sequence analogous to those described for other promoters precedes each startsite by a distance of 6 base pairs. DNA sequence analyses of the gal promoter mutation mentioned above establish that the base change is in the second residue of the heptamer preceding S1."
https://openalex.org/W2038357159,"An excellent correlation was observed between nuclear triiodothyronine (T3) and the ensuing suppression of thyrotropin (TSH) after a single intravenous injection of T3 to thyroidectomized (hypothyroid) rats. At 1 and 2 hours after injection of thyroxine (T4), in amounts equally potent to the administered T3 in terms of acute suppression of TSH, the same quantities of T3 were found in the pituitary nuclei. Virtually no nuclear T4 was present, and plasma T3 was negligible at these short intervals after T4 injection. These results suggest that suppression of TSH release in hypothyroid rats occurs by interaction of T3 with the nuclear receptor of the thyrotroph. After T4 injection, the T3 found in the nucleus is derived from rapid intrapituitary monodeiodination."
https://openalex.org/W2033991110,"The unnatural (+) enantiomer of morphine had minimal activity in three opiate assays in vitro: the rat brain homogenate binding assay, the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum assay, and the inhibition of adenylate cyclase in neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid cell homogenates. When (+)-morphine was microinfected into the periaqueductal gray (a site known to mediate morphine analgesia) of drug-naive rats, there was only minimal analgesia, but the hyperresponsivity usually observed after microinfection of (-)-morphine occurred. Also, when (+)-morphine was microinfected into the midbrain reticular formation of drug-naive rats, rotation similar to that following microinjection of (-)-morphine occurred. These behaviors were not blocked by naloxone. Significantly, they typically occur in precipitated abstinence in morphine-dependent rats. These observations suggest that there are at least two classes of receptors, one stereospecific and blocked by naloxone and the other only weakly stereospecific and not blocked by naloxone, and that precipitated abstinence may be due, in part, to a selective blockade of receptors of the former class but not of the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2067364522,"Study of the binding, internalization, and degradation of 125l-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) in human fibroblasts has disclosed a new mutant allele at the LDL receptor locus. This mutant allele, designated Rb+,io, specifies a receptor molecule that is able to bind 125l-LDL but is unable to facilitate the internalization of the receptor-bound lipoprotein. This allele has been identified through analysis of fibroblasts from four heterozygous relatives of patient J.D., the previously described subject with the clinical syndrome of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia whose fibroblasts bind but do not internalize 125l-LDL ( Brown and Goldstein, 1976c Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Analysis of a mutant strain of human fibroblasts with a defect in the internalization of receptor-bound low density lipoprotein. Cell. 1976; 9: 663-674 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar ). The current pedigree data reveal that J.D. is a genetic compound. From his father, he has inherited the Rb+,io allele. From his mother, J.D. has inherited the Rbo allele, a previously characterized mutant allele that specifies a receptor that is unable to bind LDL and hence is biochemically silent in J.D. Thus the only detectable receptors in the J.D. cells are the products of the Rb+,io allele that can bind, but not internalize, 125l-LDL. The demonstration that the LDL-binding and internalization defects do not complement one another in J.D. supports the conclusion that the mutations causing these two defects are allelic. This in turn suggests that the LDL receptor contains two functional sites on the same polypeptide chain-one that binds LDL and one that is necessary to mediate the internalization of the receptorbound lipoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W2113358201,"Sendai virus DI-RNAs which contain complementary ends have been characterized as follows. First, the complementary ends of three DI-RNAs, although somewhat different in size (110-150 base pairs), contain sequences that are both identical to each other and to the 5' end of the nondefective (ND) genome. Second, almost all the sequences contained sequences that are both identical to each other and to the 5' end of the nondefective (ND) genome. Second, almost all the sequences contained in the DI-RNAs derive from sequences that are contiguous to the 5' end of the ND genome. The ND genome, on the other hand, does not contain any sequences that are complementary to its 5' end. A genetic map and a model for the generation of the Sendai DI-RNAs are presented."

https://openalex.org/W2063797567,"A high-affinity transport system that is specific for β-amino acids has been delineated in rat hearts. This system transports the cardiotonic sulfonic amino acid taurine. β-Adrenergic stimulation increases the transport capacity without effect on α-amino acid uptake, as does stimulation with adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate or theophylline. The existence of such an uptake system for taurine in the heart accounts for the high intra- to extracellular concentration gradient that is maintained, and suggests that cardiac stress is associated with increased taurine uptake. This may explain why taurine is the only amino acid to be markedly elevated in congestive heart failure. Taurine is a modifier of calcium fluxes in the heart, as are β-adrenergic agonists. The presence of this uptake system suggests a link between β-adrenergic stimulation of calcium and taurine fluxes."
https://openalex.org/W2141202074,"Abstract Infection of mice with the neurotropic JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus causes demyelinating lesions resulting from an infection of the oligodendroglia. This was most evident in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with JHM. Such CNS lesions were not observed in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with the MHV 3 strain. An in vitro system is described in which the rat glial RN2 cell line functions as a discriminating host for the JHM virus. Shortly after inoculation, this virus establishes a persistent infection in which there is a cyclical rise and fall in titer with an accompanying cytopathology. Furthermore, this host cell confers a thermal lability which the virus does not demonstrate in the fully permissive host cell, L-2. By comparison, infection of RN2 cells with the prototype MHV 3 is aborted immediately. In the persistent infection of RN2 cells with measles virus, Halle strain, the cell again confers a temperature sensitivity which the virus does not possess when replicating in Vero cells. This appears to be the first instance in which a cloned cell line of glial origin determines the outcome of the infectious process, discriminating in favor of a neurotropic variant which possesses a tropism for the glia in vivo. Systems such as the one described here may now offer a specific screening procedure for selecting, identifying and characterizing the nature of neurotropic viruses."

https://openalex.org/W2006536228,"In two models of hypertension in rats, it was shown that collagen synthesis and deposition are increased in arteries where blood pressure is elevated. By contrast, there were no alterations in any of the markers of collagen synthesis in veins, where blood pressure was only slightly elevated. It would appear that the stimulus for vascular collagen synthesis is provided by a direct effect of the increased pressure on the arterial cells rather than by a humoral factor released into the general circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1981831747,"The nucleotide sequence of the SV40 Hind E fragment has been determined mainly by the partial chemical degradation procedure of Maxam and Gilbert (1977). The sequence of the strand with the same polarity as the late messenger RNA shows only one open reading frame for translation. Considering that VP3 corresponds to the carbosyl terminal part of VP2, and considering various evidence which indicates that the SV40 Hind E segment is part of the amino acid sequence of VP2-VP3. It continues clockwise in Hind K, where it terminates with a UAA signal. The latter is located 110 nucleotides beyond the initiation signal for the major structural protein VP1 (Fiers et al., 1975; Van de Voorde et al., 1976). Hence this small overlapping region of the genome codes for the synthesis of three different proteins in two different reading frames. The deduced amino acid sequence covers a major part of the vp3 poly peptide, and the amino acid composition is in good agreement with published values (Greenaway and Levine, 1973)."
https://openalex.org/W2058947245,"Intracellular iontophoresis of either adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate or guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate produces a membrane depolarization and an increased membrane conductance in sympathetic ganglion cells of the rat superior cervical ganglion. Since adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate did not cause a membrane hyperpolarization, it is difficult to assign it a second messenger role in the mediation of the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential. However, these results do not rule out the possibility that the cyclic nucleotides, at the intracellular concentrations attained in these experiments, participate in cellular processes that contribute to conductance changes which result in depolarization of the ganglion cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2016799315,"MANY animal cell types exhibit the ability to communicate between themselves, both in vivo and in vitro1. This phenomenon is thought to occur through gap junctions which allow cells to share their metabolites and small control molecules2–6. The overall effect of this cellular communication seems to be a coordinated control of growth and function of different cells and cell types. Interferon is believed to act at the cell membrane in a fashion similar to polypeptide hormones7–9. This membrane interaction in turn leads to de-repression and production of the antiviral protein10,11. If, as is the case with polypeptide hormones12, the induction of the antiviral protein is mediated through secondary molecules, these might influence adjacent cells. The presence of such intermediary molecules during interferon induction of the antiviral protein has been inferred from kinetic studies13,14. The many instances of the species specificity of interferon action15 make this a testable hypothesis. We show here that cells made resistant to virus infection by treatment with their homologous interferon can transfer viral resistance to cells of a heterologous species insensitive to that interferon and also to cells of the homologous species."

https://openalex.org/W2004401001,"A-MuLV-transformed lymphoid cells from Balb/c mice had the properties of null lymphocytes. They did not secrete Ig and all but one did not have detectable cell-associated Ig; one line synthesized, but did not secrete, the mu chain of IgM. The cells expressed H-2D and H-2K, but not H-21 histocompatibility antigens or theta-antigen; they had Fc receptors. Most cell lines grew to form donor cell tumors after inoculation into (Balb/c X C57B1/6)F1 mice. The tumor cells have more H-2Dd than cells passaged in vitro. Cell lines carried in vitro progressively lost H-2Dd. A line in which 5-30% of the cells were lysable by anti-H-2Dd was cloned; all eleven clones had H-2Dd (13-69% lysable) demonstrating that H-2 modulates in vitro. A clone with little H-2Dd (10-15% lysable) was tumorigenic even after treatment with anti-H-2Dd sera; at least 50% of the tumor cells were lysed by anti-H-2Dd. Thus A-MuLV-transformed lymphocytes modulate H-2 in vivo to higher levels and in vitro to lower levels."
https://openalex.org/W2026890864,"Abstract Thymus cells of preleukemic and leukemic AKR mice express on their cell surface elevated levels of antigens associated with the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) proteins gp70 and p30. The gp70 antigenicity is contained in a 70,000 dalton polypeptide that corresponds to the viral envelope protein, while the p30 antigenicity is contained in two polypeptides of 85,000 and 95,000 daltons that correspond to glycosylated forms of the polyprotein product of the gag gene. The expression of these viral coded proteins on the cell surface of thymocytes varies both quantitatively with the age of the mouse and qualitatively with the cellular populations that express these antigens. Four discrete stages in the leukemic pathway can be identified. First, low numbers of cells from the thymuses of young (2 month old) AKR mice express p30 ( The increased expression of viral antigens on the surface of thymus cells is correlated with an increased production of infectious ecotropic and xenotropic MuLV in the thymus. During aging, the percentage of cells producing ecotropic MuLV increases 10-fold, while the percentage of cells producing xenotropic MuLV increases 100 fold."
https://openalex.org/W2212042933,"In previous studies, we have shown that a relatively large amount of low density lipoproteins is released into the perfusate during isolated pig liver perfusion. The present studies were done to determine the source of these lipoproteins. Breakdown of the very low density lipoproteins to low density lipoproteins by the perfusion apparatus or by hepatic catabolism was excluded by adding 125I very low density lipoproteins to the perfusate in the presence and absence of a liver and then measuring the radioactivity in the low density lipoprotein fraction after rate-zonal ultracentrifugation. Release of preformed low density, lipoproteins from the liver was investigated by injecting iodine-labeled low density lipoproteins in vivo several hours prior to perfusion of the liver and then measuring the release of labeled low density lipoproteins into the perfusate. It was shown that intact labeled low density lipoproteins were released by the perfused liver. De novo synthesis of the low density lipoproteins was established by measuring the incorporation of [1-14C]leucine into this lipoprotein fraction. The radioactivity in the low density lipoprotein fraction increased with time and accounted for 20 to 25% of the total radioactivity incorporated into all the lipoprotein fractions. The incorporation of [1-14C]leucine into the low density lipoproteins was confirmed by rate-zonal analysis. We conclude that the low density lipoproteins in the perfusate from pig liver perfusions were derived mainly from a preformed liver pool, but also partly from de novo synthesis by the liver."

https://openalex.org/W1648047183,"Iodination of horse cytochrome c with the lactoperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-iodide system results initially in the formation of the monoiodotyrosyl 74 derivative. This singly modified protein was obtained in pure form by ion exchange chromatography and preparative column electrophoresis. It shows an intact 695 nm absorption band, the midpoint potential of the native protein, a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum which indicates an undisturbed heme crevice structure, a normal reaction with antibodies directed against native horse cytochrome c, and circular dichroic spectra in which the only changes from those of the native protein can be ascribed to the spectral properties of iodotyrosine itself. This conformationally intact derivative reacts with the succinate-cytochrome c reductase and the cytochrome c oxidase systems of beef mitochondrial particle preparations indistinguishably from the unmodified protein, showing that the region including tyrosine 74 is not involved in these enzymic electron transfer functions of the protein. The circular dichroic spectra of this derivative indicate that the minima observed at 288 and 282 nm in the spectrum of native ferricytochrome c originate from tyrosyl residue 74."

https://openalex.org/W2082992008,"Based on the following genetical experiments, the cya gene in E. coli was shown to be involved in the synthesis of both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. First, all five independent cya-deficient mutants accumulated exceedingly low amounts of cyclic GMP. Second, the ability to form both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP was simultaneously restored by transduction of an intact cya locus to one of the above cya-deficient mutants. Third, a spontaneous revertant from one of the above mutants regained the synthetic activity for cyclic GMP as well as for cyclic AMP. Fourth, the characteristic of a strain overproducing cyclic GMP was co-transduced with the cya locus. These results suggest that the synthesis of both cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP is mediated by the same enzyme, adenylate cyclase, Interestingly, a reciprocal effect of glucose starvation was observed on the accumulation of both cyclic nucleotides. The formation of cyclic AMP was greatly enhanced on glucose starvation, whereas that of cyclic GMP proceeded at a slower rate than in the presence of glucose. This effect was observed only in cells carrying normal cya and crp genes, but not in a cya-altered or a crp-deficient strain."

https://openalex.org/W96111029,"A phosphatase which catalyzes the release of 32Pi from 32P-labeled phenylalanine hydroxylase has been purified about 50-fold from rat liver extracts. The phosphatase is able to catalyze the removal of only 70 to 80% of the 32Pi leaving about the same amount of Pi still bound to the hydroxylase as was originally present in the native enzyme. Dephosphorylation is accompanied by a corresponding loss in phenylalanine hydroxylase activity when the activity is measured with the natural cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin, but not when measured with the synthetic cofactor, 6-methyltetrahydropterin. The partially purified phosphatase has very low activity toward p-nitrophenylphosphate, histone phosphate, and phosphorylase a. The activity toward these substrates has not been purified to the same extent as the phenylalanine hydroxylase phosphatase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1509275203,"Abstract Crude extracts of rabbit liver, preincubated to promote the dephosphorylation of enzymes or other regulatory proteins, were used to study the role of cyclic AMP in the activation of glycogen phosphorylase. Inasmuch as endogenous liver phosphorylase was irreversibly altered by the preincubation procedure, crystalline skeletal muscle phosphorylase was used as the substrate in these studies. In the presence of magnesium ions and ATP, phosphorylase b was converted to phosphorylase a, and in an apparent biphasic process the phosphorylase a formed was subsequently converted to phosphorylase b. In the presence of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate the rate of phosphorylase a formation and the maximal amount of phosphorylase a formed were increased. The cyclic AMP effect was enhanced by glucose-6-P and required the presence of glycogen. The catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase could replace cyclic AMP in the stimulation of phosphorylase a formation. The effects of cyclic AMP or the catalytic subunit were shown to be due to stimulation of phosphorylase kinase rather than to inhibition of phosphorylase phosphatase. Preliminary fractionation experiments showed that it is possible to separate phosphorylase kinase catalytic activity from a factor or factors required for stimulation of its activation by the catalytic subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1550362634,The 1030-residue polypeptide chain of the NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase of Neurospora crassa was fragmented by treatment with cyanogen bromide. The isolation and sequences of 18 fragments ranging in size from 4 to 51 residues are described. Some of these peptides proved to be cleavage products resulting from hydrolysis at acid-sensitive aspartyl-prolyl bonds. Some overlaps could be deduced on the basis of known sequences of peptides obtained by tryptic hydrolysis.
https://openalex.org/W1991078148,"Abstract The expression of murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-related antigens in oocytes and early embryos of Swiss mice was studied by the unlabeled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase method using an antiserum to the major core protein, p30, of AKR MuLV. This procedure resulted in an intense staining, at antibody dilutions up to 1:500, of the germinal vesicles of oocytes and the interphase nuclei of early embryos. Nuclear staining was restricted to a specific period of oocyte growth and embryo development. It developed gradually in oocytes having reached one third to one half the full-grown size and persisted until meiotic maturation. In early embryos, nuclear staining was present from the one-cell stage to the morula, but disappeared during transition from morula to blastocyst and was not seen in expanded blastocysts. Nuclear staining was abolished by absorption of the anti-p30 serum with detergent-disrupted virions of Gross(A), AKR, Kirsten and Moloney MuLV, and Kirsten MSV(MuLV), but not with the Friend and Rauscher strains of MuLV, the xenotropic BALB:virus 2, a mouse tropic and an amphotropic clone of wild mouse MuLV, or with FeLV and RSV. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that the nuclear antigen (termed germinal vesicle antigen) reacting with the anti-p30 serum is the product of a cellular gene having a normal function in early embryonic development, and that sequences related to this gene are incorporated into the genome of AKR-type MuLV."

https://openalex.org/W96819439,"A relatively crude enzyme preparation derived from the subcuticular epithelium of earthworms catalyzed the formation of 4-hydroxyproline from prolyl residues in unhydroxylated natural collagens and in several synthetic collagen-like polypeptides. The specificity of hydroxylation differed from that of all vertebrate polyl hydroxylases in that (Gly-Pro-Ala)n was a much better substrate than (Gly-Ala-Pro)n. In contrast, however, only the so-called Y position proline (Gly-X-Y) was hydroxylated in Gly-Pro-Pro sequences derived either from natural collagen or from synthetic polypeptides; specificity of hydroxylation for the latter sequence is identical with that of the vertebrate enzymes. Little or no formation of 3-hydroxyproline could be demonstrated in preparations of the enzyme active as a 4-hydroxylase. In contrast with an earlier report from another laboratory, using a crude extract of earthworm body wall, we were unable to demonstrate either significant 3-hydroxyproline formation or efficient 4-hydroxylation of X position prolyl residues in synthetic polypeptides with the internal sequence Gly-Pro-Pro."
