https://openalex.org/W1528770098,"We describe the use of a gel electrophoretic method for measuring the levels of aminoacylation in vivo of mutant Escherichia coli initiator tRNAs, which are substrates for E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) due to an anticodon sequence change. Using this method, we have compared the effects of introducing further mutations in the acceptor stem, at base pairs 1:72, 2:71, and 3:70 and discriminator base 73, on the recognition of these tRNAs by E. coli GlnRS in vitro and in vivo. The effects of the acceptor stem mutations on the kinetic parameters for aminoacylation of the mutant tRNAs in vitro are consistent with interactions seen between this region of tRNA and GlnRS in the crystal structure of tRNA(Gln). GlnRS complex. Except for one mutant, the observed levels of aminoacylation of the mutant tRNAs in vivo agree with those expected on the basis of the kinetic parameters obtained in vitro. We have also measured the relative amounts of aminoacyl-tRNAs for the various mutants and their activities in suppression of an amber codon in vivo. We find that there is, in general, a good correlation between the relative amounts of aminoacyl-tRNAs and their activities in suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1480352152,"We have demonstrated the selective induction of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) or catalase mRNA after exposure of tracheobronchial epithelial cells in vitro to different oxidant stresses. Addition of H2O2 caused a dose-dependent increase in catalase mRNA in both exponentially growing and confluent cells. A 3-fold induction of catalase mRNA was seen at a nontoxic dose of 250 microM H2O2. Increase in the steady-state mRNA levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and MnSOD were less striking. Expression of catalase, MnSOD, and GPX mRNA was highest in confluent cells. In contrast, constitutive expression of copper and zinc SOD (CuZnSOD) mRNA was greatest in dividing cells and was unaffected by H2O2 in both exponentially growing and confluent cells. MnSOD mRNA was selectively induced in confluent epithelial cells exposed to the reactive oxygen species-generating system, xanthine/xanthine oxidase, while steady-state levels of GPX, catalase, and CuZnSOD mRNA remained unchanged. The 3-fold induction of MnSOD mRNA was dose-dependent, reaching a peak at 0.2 unit/ml xanthine oxidase. MnSOD mRNA increases were seen as early as 2 h and reached maximal induction at 24 h. Immunoreactive MnSOD protein was produced in a corresponding dose- and time-dependent manner. Induction of MnSOD gene expression was prevented by addition of actinomycin D and cycloheximide. These data indicate that epithelial cells of the respiratory tract respond to different oxidant insults by selective induction of certain antioxidant enzymes. Hence, gene expression of antioxidant enzymes does not appear to be coordinately regulated in these cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2064888792,"The interaction of antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) with their ligands, peptides bound to molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is central to most immune responses, yet little is known about its chemical characteristics. The binding to T cells of a labeled monoclonal antibody to the TCR was inhibited by soluble class II MHC heterodimers complexed to different peptides. Inhibition was both peptide- and TCR-specific and of low affinity, with a KD = 4 x 10(-5) to 6 x 10(-5) M, orders of magnitude weaker than comparable antibody-antigen interactions. This finding is consistent with the scanning nature of T cell recognition and suggests that antigen-independent adhesion precedes TCR engagement."
https://openalex.org/W1994180851,"The goal of islet transplantation in human diabetes is to maintain the islet grafts in the recipients without the use of immunosuppression. One approach is to encapsulate the donor islets in permselective membranes. Hollow fibers fabricated from an acrylic copolymer were used to encapsulate small numbers of rat islets that were immobilized in an alginate hydrogel for transplantation in diabetic mice. The fibers were biocompatible, prevented rejection, and maintained normoglycemia when transplanted intraperitoneally; hyperglycemia returned when the fibers were removed at 60 days. Normoglycemia was also maintained by subcutaneous implants that had an appropriately constructed outer surface on the fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2034752755,"We have used immunocytochemical methods to localize the homeodomain LIM protein Isl-1 in the adult rat. Isl-1 immunoreactivity is expressed in polypeptide hormone-producing cells of the endocrine system, in neurons of the peripheral nervous system, and in a subset of brain nuclei. Isl-1 is also expressed in a subset of motoneurons in the spinal cord and brain stem, but not in regions of the central nervous system involved in sensory function or in neocortical areas. The pattern of expression of Isl-1 suggests that this gene may be involved in the specification and maintenance of differentiated phenotypical properties of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028746054,"We used purified cultures of cerebellar granule cells to investigate the possible protective role of stress proteins in an in vitro model of excitotoxicity. Initial experiments used one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to confirm the induction of typical stress protein size classes by heat shock, sodium arsenite, and the calcium ionophore A23187. Immunoblot analysis and immunocytochemistry verified the expression of the highly inducible 72 kd heat shock protein (HSP72). Granule cell cultures exposed to glutamate showed evidence of cellular injury that was prevented by the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist MK-801, yet glutamate did not induce a detectable stress protein response. Nonetheless, preinduction of heat shock proteins was associated with protection from toxic concentrations of glutamate. These results imply that the HSP72 expression observed in in vivo models of excitotoxicity may not be directly related to the effects of excitatory amino acids. However, the ability of stress protein induction to protect against injury from glutamate may offer a novel approach toward ameliorating damage from excitotoxins."
https://openalex.org/W2014732701,"A family of cytochrome P-450 (Pda) genes in the pathogenic fungus Nectria haematococca is responsible for the detoxification of the phytoalexin pisatin, an antimicrobial compound produced by garden pea (Pisum sativum L.). The Pda6 gene was mapped by electrophoretic karyotype analysis to a small meiotically unstable chromosome that is dispensable for normal growth. Such traits are typical of B chromosomes. The strains of Nectria studied here have no sequences that are homologous to the Pda family other than Pda6 and therefore demonstrate that unique, functional genes can be found on B chromosomes. Unstable B chromosomes may be one mechanism for generating pathogenic variation in fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2087288778,"Dimerization among transcription factors has become a recurrent theme in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) is a homeodomain-containing protein that functions as a dimer. A dimerization cofactor of HNF-1 alpha (DCoH) was identified that displayed a restricted tissue distribution and did not bind to DNA, but, rather, selectively stabilized HNF-1 alpha dimers. The formation of a stable tetrameric DCoH-HNF-1 alpha complex, which required the dimerization domain of HNF-1 alpha, did not change the DNA binding characteristics of HNF-1 alpha, but enhanced its transcriptional activity. However, DCoH did not confer transcriptional activation to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. These results indicate that DCoH regulates formation of transcriptionally active tetrameric complexes and may contribute to the developmental specificity of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W2093465048,"The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) trans-activator Tat is an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs because inhibition of Tat would arrest the virus at an early stage. The drug Ro 5-3335 [7-chloro-5-(2-pyrryl)-3H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2(H)-one], inhibited gene expression by HIV-1 at the level of transcriptional trans-activation by Tat. The compound did not inhibit the basal activity of the promoter. Both Tat and its target sequence TAR were required for the observed inhibitory activity. Ro 5-3335 reduced the amount of cell-associated viral RNA and antigen in acutely, as well as in chronically infected cells in vitro (median inhibition concentration 0.1 to 1 micromolar). Effective inhibition of viral replication was also observed 24 hours after cells were transfected with infectious recombinant HIV-1 DNA. The compound was active against both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and against 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT)-resistant clinical isolates."
https://openalex.org/W1548027699,"The intracellular Ca2+ pump inhibitor, thapsigargin, added to DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells in culture, irreversibly inhibited accumulation of Ca2+ within cells, permanently emptied the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive Ca2+ pool, and simultaneously induced profound alteration of cell growth. After only a brief (30-min) treatment of cultured cells with 3 microM thapsigargin followed by extensive washing, the total releasable InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool remained entirely empty, even after 7 days of culture without thapsigargin. After thapsigargin treatment, cells retained viability, usual morphology, and normal mitochondrial function. Despite the otherwise normal appearance and function of thapsigargin-treated cells, cell division was completely blocked by thapsigargin. DNA synthesis was completely inhibited when thapsigargin was added immediately after passaging, but was suppressed only slowly (4-6 h) when added to rapidly synthesizing cells (24 h after passaging). Protein synthesis was reduced by approximately 70% in thapsigargin-treated cells. The sensitivity of thapsigargin-mediated inhibition of cell division, DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and Ca(2+)-pumping activity were all similar with the EC50 values for thapsigargin in each case being close to 10 nM. Upon application to DDT1MF-2 cells, thapsigargin transiently increased resting cytosolic Ca2+ (0.15 microM) to a peak of 0.3 microM within 50 s; thereafter, free Ca2+ declined to 0.2 microM by 150 s and continued to slowly decline toward resting levels. Cells treated with thapsigargin for 1-72 h in culture displayed normal resting cytosolic Ca2+ levels. However, application of thapsigargin or epinephrine to such cells resulted in no change in the intracellular Ca2+, indicating that the internal Ca2+ pool remained completely empty. These results suggest that emptying of Ca2+ from intracellular thapsigargin-sensitive Ca(2+)-pumping pools induces profound alteration of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2029426257,"Pancreatic islet cells are the targets of an autoimmune response in type I diabetes. In the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of autoimmune diabetes, expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins was inversely correlated with diabetes; in this mouse a mutation in the MHC class II-linked gene for the putative MHC class I peptide transporter was also present. Mice deficient in MHC class I expression because they do not produce beta 2-microglobulin also developed late onset autoimmune diabetes. In cells from humans with type I diabetes expression of MHC class I was decreased; subsets of prediabetics categorized as most likely to become hyperglycemic also had low MHC class I. T cell responses to self antigens are faulty in diabetics. In sets of genetically identical twins that are discordant for diabetes, the defect appeared to reside with the antigen presenting cell. Thus, a lack of surface MHC class I protein is associated with autoimmune diabetes; the concomitant defect in antigen presentation may impair the development of self tolerance, which could result in autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W1578374210,"Injection of heat-killed bacteria into larvae of the large tenebrionid beetle Zophobas atratus (Insecta, Endopterygota, Coleoptera) results in the appearance in the hemolymph of a potent antibacterial activity as evidenced by a plate growth inhibition assay. We have isolated three peptides (A-C) from this immune hemolymph which probably account for most of this activity. Their primary structures were established by a combination of peptide sequencing and molecular mass determination by mass spectrometry. Peptide A, which is bactericidal against Gram-negative cells, is a 74-residue glycine-rich molecule with no sequence homology to known peptides. We propose the name coleoptericin for this novel inducible antibacterial peptide. Peptides B and C are isoforms of a 43-residue peptide which contains 6 cysteines and shows significant sequence homology to insect defensins, initially reported from dipteran insects. This peptide is active against Gram-positive bacteria. The results are discussed in connection with recent studies on inducible antibacterial peptides present in the three other major orders of the endopterygote clade of insects: the Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera."
https://openalex.org/W1603195684,"To elucidate a functional role of N-glycosylation in glucose transporters, we introduced oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in GLUT1 cDNA to remove the possible site for N-linked glycosylation. The wild-type and the mutated GLUT1 cDNAs which induced a mutation of Asn at residue 45 to Asp, Tyr, or Gln were transfected and stably expressed into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The expressed wild-type and the mutated GLUT1 was demonstrated to be a broad band of a 45-60-kDa form and a sharp band of a 38-kDa form on Western blot analysis, respectively, indicating no glycosylation in the mutated GLUT1. Although the cell surface labeling of the glucose transporters demonstrated the presence of the glycosylation-defective glucose transporters on the cells surface, photoaffinity labeling of glycosylation-defective GLUT1 with [3H] cytochalasin B and a photoreactive mannose derivative, [3H]2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2,trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos+ ++-4-yloxy)-2- propylamine in the membranes was observed to be 40-70 and 15-30% of that of the wild-type GLUT1, respectively. The kinetic study of 2-deoxyglucose uptake revealed that the glycosylation-defective GLUT1 had a 2-2.5-fold greater Km value for 2-deoxyglucose uptake compared with the wild-type GLUT1. These observations strongly suggest that 1) N-glycosylation of GLUT1 glucose transporter is only on Asn 45 and 2) N-glycosylation plays an important role in maintaining a structure of glucose transporter with high affinity for glucose, thus, with high transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W1541426877,"Cholesteryl ester-loaded macrophages, or foam cells, are a prominent feature of atherosclerotic lesions. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytosis of native LDL is a relatively poor inducer of macrophage cholesteryl ester accumulation. However, the data herein show that in the presence of a very small amount of sphingomyelinase, LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis of 125I-LDL was enhanced and led to a 2-6-fold increase in 125I-LDL degradation and up to a 10-fold increase in cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages. The enhanced lipoprotein uptake and cholesterol esterification was seen after only approximately 12% hydrolysis of LDL phospholipids, was specific for sphingomyelin hydrolysis, and appeared to be related to the formation of fused or aggregated spherical particles up to 100 nm in diameter. Sphingomyelinase-treated LDL was bound by the macrophage LDL receptor. However, when unlabeled acetyl-LDL, a scavenger receptor ligand, was present during or after sphingomyelinase treatment of 125I-LDL, 125I-LDL binding and degradation were enhanced further through the formation of LDL-acetyl-LDL mixed aggregates. Experiments with cytochalasin D suggested that endocytosis, not phagocytosis, was involved in internalization of sphingomyelinase-treated LDL. Nonetheless, the sphingomyelinase effect on LDL uptake was macrophage-specific. These data illustrate that LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis of fused LDL particles can lead to foam cell formation in cultured macrophages. Furthermore, since both LDL and sphingomyelinase are present in atherosclerotic lesions and since some lesion LDL probably is fused or aggregated, there is a possibility that sphingomyelinase-treated LDL is a physiologically important atherogenic lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1987002949,"Monoclonal antibodies have been used to identify a 320 kd keratan sulfate proteoglycan that is primarily expressed in the embryonic chick nervous system. Immunohistochemical localization of the proteoglycan shows that it is expressed by putative midline barrier structures in the developing chick central nervous system. When added to laminin or neural cell adhesion molecule that has been adsorbed onto nitrocellulose-coated dishes, the proteoglycan abolishes cell attachment and neurite outgrowth on these adhesive substrata. This effect can be reversed by keratanase treatment and incubation with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the keratan sulfate chains of the proteoglycan. These data suggest that this neural keratan sulfate proteoglycan plays an important role in the modulation of neuronal cell adhesion during embryonic brain development."
https://openalex.org/W1541009780,"Human interleukin (IL)-5 receptors were characterized by means of binding studies using bioactive 125I-labeled IL-5. Of purified primary myeloid cells, eosinophils and basophils but not neutrophils or monocytes expressed surface receptors for IL-5. Binding studies showed that eosinophils expressed a single class of high affinity receptors (Ka = 1.2 x 10(10) M-1) with the number of receptors being small (less than 1000 receptors/cell) and varying between individuals. Among several cell lines examined only HL-60 cells showed detectable IL-5 receptors which were small in numbers (200 receptors/cell) and also bound 125I-IL-5 with high affinity. The binding of IL-5 was rapid at 37 degrees C while requiring several hours to reach equilibrium at 4 degrees C. Specificity studies revealed that the two other human eosinophilopoietic cytokines IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) inhibited the binding of 125I-IL-5 to eosinophils. No competition was observed by other eosinophil activating or nonactivating cytokines. The inhibition of 125I-IL-5 binding by IL-3 and GM-CSF was partial up to a concentration of competitor of 10(-7) M with GM-CSF consistently being the stronger competitor. Converse experiments using IL-5 as a competitor revealed that this cytokine inhibited the binding of 125I-IL-3 and of 125I-GM-CSF in some but not all the individuals tested, perhaps reflecting eosinophil heterogeneity in vivo. Cross-linking experiments on HL-60 cells demonstrated two IL-5-containing complexes of Mr 150,000 and Mr 80,000 both of which were inhibited by GM-CSF. The competition between IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF on the surface of mature eosinophils may represent a unifying mechanism that may help explain the common biological effects of these three eosinophilopoietic cytokines on eosinophil function. This unique pattern of competition may also be beneficial to the host by preventing excessive eosinophil stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1481479057,"We have used purified transcription factors and RNA polymerase I (pol I) to analyze the individual steps involved in the formation of transcription initiation complexes at the mouse ribosomal gene promoter in vitro. Complete assembly of transcription complexes requires pol I and at least four auxiliary factors, termed TIF-IA, TIF-IB, TIF-IC, and UBF. Preincubation and template commitment, as well as order of addition protocols, were used to discriminate between various intermediate complexes generated during assembly of the initiation complex. As a first step, TIF-IB binds to the core promoter, a process that is facilitated by the upstream control element and the upstream binding factor (UBF). Binding of TIF-IB to the rDNA promoter results in the formation of a functional preinitiation complex (complex 1), which is stable for many rounds of transcription. UBF, which on its own does not stably associate with the rDNA promoter, triggers a 5-10-fold increase in the overall amount of this primary complex. Following binding of TIF-IB and UBF to the template DNA, pol I and TIF-IC successively bind, yielding complexes 2 and 3, respectively. Transcription-competent initiation complexes are built up by the final association of the growth-regulated factor TIF-IA. The various complexes can be distinguished by their different sensitivity to Sarkosyl. Only the complete complex consisting of all four factors and pol I shows resistance to intermediate concentrations of Sarkosyl (0.045%) and is competent to catalyze the formation of the first phosphodiester bond. The initiated complex is, on the other hand, resistant to high concentrations of Sarkosyl (0.3%). The hierarchical nature of the different complexes formed suggests a model for transcription initiation and predicts functions for the individual factors."
https://openalex.org/W2041237554,"Rap1A is a low molecular weight guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein in human neutrophil membranes whose cellular function is unknown. Rap1A was found to form stoichiometric complexes with the cytochrome b558 component of the phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase system. The (guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S)-bound form of Rap1A bound more tightly to cytochrome b558 than did the guanosine diphosphate-bound form. No complex formation was observed between cytochrome b558 and H-Ras-GTP-gamma-S or Rap1A-GTP-gamma-S that had been heat-inactivated, nor between Rap1A-GTP-gamma-S and hydrophobic proteins serving as controls. Complex formation between Rap1A-GTP-gamma-S and cytochrome b558 was inhibited by phosphorylation of Rap1A with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase. These observations suggest that Rap1A may participate in the structure or regulation of the NADPH oxidase system and that this function of the Rap1A protein may be altered by phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1533083198,"A glycoprotein reactive with antibodies against corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan (KSPG) was purified 300-fold from extracts of bovine aorta using DEAE ion-exchange, gel-filtration, hydrophobic interaction, and reverse-phase chromatographic separations. The intact glycoprotein was 70-80 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Deglycosylation with endo-beta-galactosidase and N-glycanase reduced the size to 48 and 37 kDa, respectively, similar to the large isoforms of corneal KSPG. N-terminal amino acid sequence of the arterial KSPG was identical with lumican, the 37B isoform of corneal KSPG, and the arterial KSPG reacted with an antibody to synthetic peptide duplicating this sequence. Arterial KSPG and corneal lumican displayed identical tryptic maps. Arterial lumican contains fucose and mannose in amounts similar to corneal KSPG, but galactose, glucosamine, and sulfate were reduced compared to KSPG from cornea. Treatment of arterial lumican with endo-beta-galactosidase released 8-9 mol of glucosamine and galactose per mol of protein as oligosaccharides. These eluted as neutral, nonsulfated oligosaccharides on high pH anion-exchange chromatography. The size of arterial lumican was not altered by glycosidases having specificity for sulfated keratan sulfate, nor was the charge of the lumican molecule altered by digestion with endo-beta-galactosidase. These data show arterial lumican to be a glycoprotein containing unsulfated lactosaminoglycan chains. Abundance of low sulfate lumican in many tissues indicates that this protein occurs predominantly as a glycoprotein rather than as the more widely studied, highly sulfated proteoglycan present in the cornea."
https://openalex.org/W1538477674,"As an approach to defining the role of p53 in cellular proliferation, murine cell lines were derived which contain a stably transfected temperature-inducible p53 expression system. Cell lines derived with the system exhibited a 3-6-fold physiologic elevation in the cellular p53 concentration when grown at 32.5 degrees C. A p53 induction phenotype was defined by examination of the growth properties of these lines at 32.5 degrees C. The induction phenotype had three main features: 1) a 2-4-fold increase in doubling time and biphasic growth kinetics; 2) delayed early S phase transit; and 3) complete reversibility either by growth at 37 degrees C or by growth in the presence of added hypoxanthine or xanthosine. The reversal of the induction phenotype by these purine salvage precursors implicated the purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway as the cellular target for the antiproliferative action of p53. Subsequent genetic and biochemical analyses identified a p53 induction-related purine pathway defect which was localized to the step of inosine 5'-monophosphate conversion to xanthosine 5'-monophosphate. This enzymatic step catalyzed by inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.14) is the rate-limiting step for GTP synthesis. Extracts from p53-inducible cells growing at the induction temperature show a specific reduction in inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity. These findings define p53 as a cellular regulator of the synthesis of GTP, a key regulatory nucleotide for many important cellular processes. Moreover, observations of the growth behavior of p53-inducible cells suggest that by regulating the production of GTP, p53 can control cellular quiescence."
https://openalex.org/W1596274814,"Chain shortening via beta-oxidation from the omega-end has been recognized as the major pathway for the degradation of cysteinyl leukotrienes as well as leukotriene B4 (LTB4). The metabolic compartmentation of this pathway was studied using peroxisomes purified from normal and clofibrate-treated rat liver. beta-Oxidation products of omega-carboxy-LTB4, including omega-carboxy-dinor-LTB4 identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were formed by the isolated peroxisomes. The reaction was dependent on CoA, ATP, and NAD and was stimulated by FAD. NADPH was necessary for the further metabolism of omega-carboxy-dinor-LTB4. Together with microsomes a degradation of omega-carboxy-LTB4 also proceeded in isolated mitochondria in the presence of CoA, ATP, and carnitine. beta-Oxidation of the cysteinyl leukotriene omega-carboxy-N-acetyl-leukotriene E4 was observed only with isolated peroxisomes in combination with lipid-depleted microsomes. Direct photoaffinity labeling using omega-carboxy-[3H] LTB4 and omega-carboxy-N-[3H]acetyl-LTE4 served to identify peroxisomal leukotriene-binding proteins. The bifunctional protein (EC 4.2.1.17 and 1.1.1.35) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.16) of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation system were the predominantly labeled polypeptides as revealed by precipitation with monospecific antibodies. In vivo studies with N-acetyl-[3H2]LTE4, N-acetyl-[3H8]LTE4, and N-[14C]acetyl-LTE4 after treatment with the peroxisome proliferator clofibrate indicated formation and biliary excretion of large amounts of metabolites more polar than omega-carboxy-tetranor-N-acetyl-LTE3 including omega-carboxy-tetranor-delta 13-N-acetyl-LTE4 and omega-carboxy-hexanor-N-acetyl-LTE3. Increased formation of beta-oxidized catabolites of N-acetyl-LTE4 and LTB4 was also observed in hepatocytes isolated after clofibrate treatment. Our results indicate that peroxisomes play a major role in the beta-oxidation of leukotrienes from the omega-end. Whereas omega-carboxy-LTB4 was beta-oxidized both in isolated peroxisomes and mitochondria, the cysteinyl leukotriene omega-carboxy-N-acetyl-LTE4 was exclusively degraded in peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W1604865161,"Isoprenoid (branched) fatty acids such as pristanic acid can be degraded via beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. We synthesized 2-methylpalmitoyl-CoA as a model substrate in order to study the first step of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of branched fatty acids, catalyzed by an acyl-CoA oxidase. 2-Methylpalmitoyl-CoA oxidase activity was found in rat liver homogenates. Subcellular fractionation demonstrated that the oxidase was confined to peroxisomes. 2-Methylpalmitoyl-CoA oxidase was also present in kidney and intestine. It was not induced in liver or in the extrahepatic tissues by treatment of rats with peroxisome proliferators or by feeding diets containing excess isoprenoids. The enzyme was partially purified together with palmitoyl-CoA oxidase and trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase by heat treatment and ammonium sulfate fractionation of liver extracts. The partially purified preparation was chromatographed on various columns. 2-Methylpalmitoyl-CoA oxidase could be separated from the inducible (by peroxisome proliferators) palmitoyl-CoA oxidase and from trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase, but it always coeluted with the noninducible palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, recently described by us (Schepers, L., Van Veldhoven, P. P., Casteels, M., Eyssen, H. J., and Mannaerts, G. P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5242-5246). 2-Methylpalmitoyl-CoA oxidase was purified to near homogeneity in three chromatographic steps (anion exchange, hydroxylapatite, and gel filtration). Its apparent molecular mass is approximately 415 kDa, and it consists of identical subunits of approximately 70 kDa. The enzyme oxidized 2-methylpalmitoyl-CoA twice as rapidly as palmitoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA as rapidly as palmitoyl-CoA, so that it can be considered as a branched fatty acyl-CoA oxidase. Since pristanoyl-CoA is one of its naturally occurring substrates we propose to name this enzyme pristanoyl-CoA oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1505264709,"The nonactivated glucocorticoid receptor (Mr approximately 350,000) of WEHI-7 mouse lymphoma cells was investigated with respect to the stoichiometry of protein subunits. Cross-linking patterns obtained by affinity labeling and denaturing gel electrophoresis revealed a heterotetramer consisting of one receptor polypeptide in association with two 90- and one approximately 50-kDa subunits. The receptor stabilized by molybdate, disulfide bond formation, or chemical cross-linking was purified roughly 6000-fold by immunoaffinity chromatography and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The 90-kDa component was consistently detected in a 2:1 ratio with respect to the receptor polypeptide and was identified as the 90-kDa heat shock protein, hsp90. A 70-kDa heat shock protein was found in both stabilized and nonstabilized receptors and bound to the immunomatrix independent of receptor. The additional receptor subunit was unequivocally identified as the 59-kDa protein previously described (Tai, P.-K. K., Maeda, Y., Nakao, K., Wakim, N. G., Duhring, J. L., and Faber, L. E. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 5269-5275). This component was found only in complexes cross-linked via amino groups. It was removed from the molybdate-stabilized receptor under our purification conditions, thus leaving behind a trimer composed of the receptor polypeptide and two molecules of hsp90. In the absence of hormone, the receptor had the same subunit composition as in its presence."
https://openalex.org/W1546234696,"Autoxidation as a function of hemoglobin concentration indicates a 17-fold increase in the rate of autoxidation from 0.25 (%/h) to 4.3 (%/h) when tetrameric oxyhemoglobin dissociates into dimers. As a result of this large enhancement, a contribution of dissociation to the autoxidation is evident even at relatively high concentrations of hemoglobin for which it is usually considered that dissociation can be neglected. The mechanism for this phenomenon is attributed to alterations in the ligand pocket which occur when constraints due to subunit contacts within the R-state are eliminated."
https://openalex.org/W1496883621,"The expression of cytocidal activity is induced by the sequential interaction of macrophages with a priming stimulus, such as interferon (IFN)alpha, -beta, or -gamma, and a triggering stimulus, such as poly(I.C) or lipopolysaccharide. However, most triggering stimuli are also capable of inducing IFN expression. This suggested to us the possibility that in addition to its role in initially priming macrophages for cytocidal activity, IFN may also be expressed during the triggering stage where it may potentially contribute to the regulation of cytocidal activity. We have explored this question by (i) attempting to dissociate IFN-inducing activity from triggering activity with a variety of structurally related and charge-related polyanions; (ii) determining if macrophages express IFN during the triggering stage; and (iii) questioning if IFN produced during the triggering stage contributes to the regulation of cytocidal activation. Exposure of unprimed macrophages to a triggering concentration of poly(I.C) alone failed to induce IFN beta expression. However, exposure of IFN beta-primed cells to poly(I.C) dramatically increased the expression of IFN beta mRNA. Priming with IFN gamma was likewise found to increase the expression of IFN beta mRNA in response to a triggering concentration of polyribonucleotides. Three approaches were adopted to ascertain if the increased expression of IFN beta contributed to cytocidal activation. First, macrophages derived from strains of mice which differ in their susceptibility to IFN induction by poly(I.C) were primed with IFN beta, washed, and triggered with poly(I.C). Under these conditions, macrophages derived from stain B10.A(2R), which are hyporesponsive to poly(I.C) in terms of IFN induction, also showed a diminished capacity to express Bf, a marker of cytocidal activation. Second, exposure of IFN-primed macrophages to poly(I.C) in the presence of anti-IFN alpha/beta antibody was found to reduce substantially the synthesis of NO2/NO3, an alternative marker of macrophage cytocidal activation. Third, exposure of IFN-primed macrophages to the calcium ionophores ionomycin or A23187, which do not induce the production of IFN beta during triggering, led to an abbreviated expression of Bf compared with stimuli that induce IFN beta expression such as poly(I.C). However, the capacity to synthesize Bf in response to A23187 was partially reconstituted when macrophages were triggered with the ionophore in the continuous presence of IFN beta. Collectively, these data show that IFN beta is expressed during the triggering stage of macrophage cytocidal activation and suggest that it plays an important and previously unsuspected role in the expression of this state."
https://openalex.org/W1524872354,"The promastigote surface antigen-2 (PSA-2) complex comprises a group of immunogenic surface antigens linked to the surface of the Leishmania major promastigote with glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors. The L. major genome contains at least 14 PSA-2 genes on a 950-kilobase chromosome and comprising approximately 20% of the length of this chromosome. The sequence of three independent, but incomplete, PSA-2 cDNAs and one genomic fragment encoding a complete PSA-2 coding sequence were compared. PSA-2 genes encode polypeptides exhibiting 22-25aa tandem repeat elements, threonine-rich segments which vary between genes, a conserved COOH-terminal cysteine-rich region, and a conserved GPI anchor signal sequence. PSA-2 genes appear to be transcribed in a complex manner with multiple RNAs. The complex genomic organization of PSA-2 genes is present in other members of the genus suggesting that PSA-2 function is important for the biology of Leishmania."
https://openalex.org/W1532388415,"Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activity, expressed on the basis of cell number, increased by 50% during sodium butyrate-induced differentiation of human K562 erythroleukemia cells. The increased enzyme activity was found to be concomitant with constant Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase mRNA and immunoreactive protein levels and was accompanied by a rise in intracellular copper and glutathione. Incubation of K562 cell homogenates with copper caused an increase of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activity which reached the levels observed after differentiation in the presence of sodium butyrate. The same treatment led to no significant activity increase in homogenates derived from differentiated cells. Externally added ceruloplasmin increased both intracellular copper levels and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activity in undifferentiated cells to a level comparable with that observed after induction of differentiation. Both increments were abolished by depletion of cell glutathione. Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase purified from control cells had both a lower kcat and a lower copper content than the enzyme purified from differentiated cells. From these data we conclude that: 1) Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase is present in K562 cells also under the form of a less active copper-deficient enzyme, 2) the extent of enzyme activation is regulated post-translationally by differential delivery of copper as a function of differentiation stage, and 3) glutathione is likely to play a role in delivering copper to the copper-deficient protein in intact K562 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1559268142,"We have recently developed a reconstitution assay which allows the rapid determination of sodium- and chloride-dependent glycine transport activity of many fractions (Lopez-Corcuera, B., and Aragon, C. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 181, 519-524). In this paper we report the purification of the sodium- and chloride-coupled glycine transporter from pig brain stem. Transporter is solubilized from plasma membrane vesicles with 2% cholate and purified by sequential chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, and hydroxylapatite columns, followed by a 5-20% sucrose density gradient fractionation. Taking into account the inactivation suffered by the transporter, a final increase in specific activity of about 450-fold is achieved. Although two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 100 and 37 kDa are progressively enriched during the chromatographic steps, only the 100-kDa band comigrates with transport activity along the density gradient. This band is finally isolated to apparent homogeneity in the active fractions. We conclude that the 100-kDa band represents the glycine transporter. Finally, the pure transporter can be reconstituted into liposomes, retaining the absolute dependence on sodium and chloride gradients, the electrogenicity, the glycine affinity, the substrate specificity, and the sensitivity to group-selective modifiers characteristic of the native transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1595426874,"Three explanations have been advanced to account for the unexpected absence of direct hydrogen bonds and presence of a buried water layer in the co-crystal-line complex of Escherichia coli trp repressor with DNA. We present results of physical and biochemical measurements that address the testable predictions of each model. We find that the DNA oligomer used for co-crystallization binds to the repressor with high affinity and specificity, and 1:1 stoichiometry, consistent with other evidence that this sequence represents the true operator target for a single repressor dimer. A proposed alternative DNA sequence binds weaker and with higher stoichiometry, consistent with a cooperative binding mode. The operator DNA in solution has a B-form helical structure in the presence and absence of repressor. Affinity of repressor for operator is altered under the conditions used for cocrystal growth."
https://openalex.org/W178637844,"Activated protein C (APC) exerts its physiologic anticoagulant role by proteolytic inactivation of the blood coagulation cofactors Va and VIIIa. To identify the regions on the surface that mediate anticoagulant activity, 26 synthetic peptides were prepared representing 90% of the human protein C heavy chain primary structure and tested for their ability to inhibit APC anticoagulant activity. Peptide-(390-404) specifically inhibited APC activity in activated partial thromboplastin time and Xa-1-stage coagulation assays in normal, in protein S-depleted and Factor VIII-deficient plasma with 50% inhibition at 5 microM peptide. Polyclonal antibodies raised against this peptide and immunoaffinity-purified on a protein C-Sepharose column inhibited APC anticoagulant activity in activated partial thromboplastin time and Xa-1-stage assays in normal, protein S-depleted, and Factor VIII-deficient plasma with half-maximal inhibition at 30 nM anti-(390-404) antibody. Neither the peptide-(390-404) nor the anti-(390-404) antibodies inhibited APC amidolytic activity or the reaction of APC with recombinant [Arg358] alpha 1-antitrypsin. Furthermore, in a purified system, peptide-(390-404) inhibited APC-catalyzed inactivation of Factor Va in the presence as well as in the absence of phospholipids with 50% inhibition at 4 microM peptide. These data suggest that the region containing residues 390-404 in APC is essential for anticoagulant activity and is available to interact with antibodies or with other proteins such as the macromolecular substrates Factors Va or VIIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1598958185,"Abstract Rat cellular retinol-binding protein II (CRBP II) is an abundant 134-residue intestinal protein that binds all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinal. It belongs to a family of homologous, 15-kDa cytoplasmic proteins that bind hydrophobic ligands in a noncovalent fashion. These binding proteins include a number of proteins that bind long chain fatty acids. X-ray analyses of the structure of two family members, rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein and bovine myelin P2 protein, indicate that they have a high degree of conformational similarity and that the carboxylate group of their bound fatty acid interacts with a delta-guanidium group of at least 1 of 2 buried arginine residues. These 2 Arg residues are conserved in other family members that bind long chain fatty acids and in cellular retinoic acid-binding protein, but are replaced by Gln109 and Gln129 in CRBP II. We have genetically engineered two amino acid substitutions in CRBP II: 1) Gln109 to Arg and 2) Gln129 to Arg. The purified Escherichia coli-derived CRBP II mutant proteins were analyzed by fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Both mutants exhibit markedly decreased binding of all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinaldehyde, but no increased binding of all-trans-retinoic acid. Arg substitution for Gln109 but not for Gln129 produces a dramatic increase in palmitate binding activity. Analysis of the endogenous fatty acids associated with the purified E. coli-derived proteins revealed that E. coli-derived intestinal fatty acid binding protein and the Arg109 CRBP II mutant are complexed with endogenous fatty acids in a qualitatively and quantitatively similar manner. These results provide evidence that this internal Arg may play an important role in the binding of long chain fatty acids by members of this protein family."
https://openalex.org/W1574176627,"Cryoelectron microscopy has been performed on frozen-hydrated pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes from bovine heart and kidney and on various subcomplexes consisting of the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase-based (E2) core and substoichiometric levels of the other two major components, pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3). The diameter of frozen-hydrated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is 50 nm, which is significantly larger than previously reported values. On the basis of micrographs of the subcomplexes, it is concluded that the E1 and E3 are attached to the E2-core complex by extended (4-6 nm maximally) flexible tethers. PDC constructed in this manner would probably collapse and appear smaller than its native size when dehydrated, as was the case in previous electron microscopy studies. The tether linking E1 to the core involves the hinge sequence located between the E1-binding and catalytic domains in the primary sequence of E2, whereas the tether linking E3 is probably derived from a similar hinge-type sequence in component X. Tilting of the E2-based cores and comparison with model structures confirmed that their overall shape is that of a pentagonal dodecahedron. The approximately 6 copies of protein X present in PDC do not appear to be clustered in one or two regions of the complex and are not likely to be symmetrically distributed."
https://openalex.org/W1530086941,"Abstract The human CSP-B/CGL-1 gene is the homologue of the mouse granzyme B/CCPI gene and encodes a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-specific serine protease. We have used regulatory sequences upstream from the CSP-B gene to drive human growth hormone gene expression in transgenic mice. Eleven founder mice were screened for transgene expression in activated T-cells. Expression was detected in 10 mice; levels of expression were integration site-dependent. The transgene was not expressed in resting lymphocytes but could be activated by treatment with concanavalin A or interleukin-2, indicating that CSP-B regulatory sequences are responsive to signals originating at either the T-cell receptor or the interleukin-2 receptor. Transgene expression was detected at the whole organ level only in lymph nodes and small intestine, where endogenous mouse CCPI mRNA was also present. The time course of transgene activation in T-lymphocytes was similar to that of the mouse CCPI gene. No differences in levels of expression of the transgene were observed in activated lymphocyte populations that had been depleted of either CD4+ or CD8+ cells; in contrast, the mouse CCPI gene was expressed primarily in CD8+ cells. Six CD4+ T-cell clones with Th0, Th1, or Th2 phenotypes were generated from a transgenic animal. All clones expressed moderate to high levels of the transgene, but only three clones expressed mouse CCPI, indicating that the transgene is disregulated in CD4+ T-cell subsets. The CSP-B regulatory unit represents a novel reagent for targeting gene expression to activated T-lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1597866483,"Ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.1) catalyzes the final step of heme biosynthesis, the insertion of iron(II) into protoporphyrin. It is an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The functional size of bovine hepatic ferrochelatase has been studied in situ using radiation inactivation analysis. The functional unit required for enzymic activity in intact mitochondria was found to have a mass of 82 +/- 13 kDa. In contrast, the structural unit (evaluated in immunoblots following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) has a mass of 40 +/- 10 kDa. Similar results were obtained when irradiation was performed on sodium cholate-solubilized mitochondria. The presence or absence of dithiothreitol during irradiation had no effect on target sizes obtained from either intact or solubilized mitochondria. Pairwise comparison of the functional and structural target sizes from each set of irradiated samples yielded a ratio of 2.0 +/- 0.4. Previous studies using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography have shown that a Mr 40,000 peptide is associated with ferrochelatase activity. This study shows that the functional size of bovine ferrochelatase is approximately 80 kDa; the data are most consistent with a model for active ferrochelatase composed of two structural subunits of about 40 kDa each."
https://openalex.org/W1518052287,"We have isolated and mapped to the left end of chromosome III a single-copy gene (TRG1) encoding a 72-kDa glycoprotein, by screening a yeast genomic library with a DNA probe specifying the catalytic center (APWCGHCK) of thioredoxin-related proteins. the TRG1 gene sequence predicts an amino-terminal leader peptide, two thioredoxin-like domains, five N-glycosylation sites and a carboxyl-terminal HDEL retention signal. The TRG1 protein shows about equal sequence similarity to a mammalian multifunctional protein family residing in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and to a putative cytosolic alpha form of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C. Haploid cells do not survive TRG1 gene disruptions, unless an additional wild-type copy is generated by interchromosomal transposition. Antibodies raised against synthetic amino- and carboxyl-terminal epitopes recognize a pair of lumenl ER glycoproteins (gp70/72) and a cytosolic 48-kDa protein. A 1.8-kilobase TRG1 transcript was translated by a reticulocyte lysate into a 60-kDa protein, which was translocated and processed to a 72-kDa glycoprotein in the presence of ER membrane vesicles. The TRG1 gene was placed under the control of the galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible GAL1 promoter, leading to growth arrest in glucose media. Glucose repression of the TRG1 gene caused the disappearance of gp72 and the accumulation of procarboxypeptidase. Our data indicate that the TRG1 gene encodes a growth essential lumenal ER glycoprotein involved the maturation of vacuolar carboxypeptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1554053162,"The structure of rat carboxypeptidase A2 (CPA2), which has a unique specificity for tryptophan-containing COOH-terminal peptides, has been determined in an unliganded state at 1.9-A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 18.3%. Comparison of the structure of CPA2 with that of bovine carboxypeptidase A (referred to here as CPA1) reveals that the specificity of the former for larger amino acids probably arises from two amino acid replacements within the binding cavity (Thr268----Ala and Leu203----Met), coupled with differences in the positions of conserved residues in a surface loop on one face of the specificity pocket. The position of the reactive-site surface loop may be affected also by a disulfide bridge between Cys210 and Cys244. In this unliganded form of the enzyme, Tyr248 takes up a position interior to the specificity pocket and is distinct from that observed in bovine CPA1. The structural differences between CPA1 and CPA2 correlate strongly with crystallographically determined temperature factors and thus appear to be largest where the enzyme is flexible."

We report the isolation and characterization of an agonist-regulated capping protein, aginactin, from Dictyostelium that may regulate these changes in actin nucleation activity. Aginactin is isolated from low speed supernatants of starved amoebae by sequential anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, fast protein liquid chromatography anion exchange, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Aginactin migrates with an apparent molecular weight of 70,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and gel filtration columns, suggesting that it is a globular monomer. Aginactin is a barbed-end capping protein by several criteria. It inhibits the rate and final extent of actin polymerization and increases the apparent critical concentration at substoichiometric ratios to actin. It also inhibits depolymerization of F-actin and inhibits polymerization at the barbed end of Limulus acrosomal bundles. Aginactin is unaffected by micromolar Ca2+, and it neither severs F-actin nor nucleates actin polymerization in either the presence or absence of Ca2+. Aginactin binds to and cosediments with F-actin and has an apparent Kd for capping F-actin of 2.7 nM."
https://openalex.org/W1518570048,"One of the factors involved in the postfertilization activation of protein synthesis in the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, is the activation of eIF-2B, the initiation factor responsible for guanine nucleotide exchange on eIF-2. Cell-free translation systems from unfertilized eggs are stimulated by added eIF-2B, although this dependency is rapidly lost in translation systems prepared at various times following fertilization. Cell-free translation systems prepared from unfertilized eggs show significantly lower eIF-2B activities than those prepared from 2-h embryos. However, the provision of an NADPH regeneration system significantly stimulates eIF-2B activity in egg extracts and, in addition, stimulates both binding of initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit and protein synthetic activity. These data suggest that the activation of eIF-2B following fertilization reflects the fertilization-induced increase in NADPH levels."

Label from aspartate is incorporated into D-glutamic acid and m-diaminopimelic acid of cell-wall peptidoglycan, while label from alanine appears in the C-1 positions of both D- and L-alanyl residues. The cross-link index (the fraction of peptide stems joined by an isopeptide covalent bond) is obtained directly from analysis of the results of the 13C NMR experiments. However, specific isotopic enrichments of cell-wall components cannot be obtained from NMR data alone. The latter are determined either from a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of the amino acids derived from hydrolysis of cell-wall peptidoglycan, or from a combination of NMR and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric results. The combined analysis is overdetermined and so involves the least error for evaluations of both the cross-link index and the isotopic enrichments. The cross-link index is 0.33 +/- 0.03 for cell walls of B. subtilis grown in the presence of the antibiotic, cephalothin."
https://openalex.org/W1593851718,"Numerous candidates have been suggested according to chemical and structural criteria for the active site base of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase that catalyzes substrate enolization. We evaluate the functional significance of two such candidates, His-321 and Ser-368 of the Rhodospirillum rubrum enzyme, by site-directed mutagenesis. Position 321 mutants retain 3-12% of wild-type rates of both overall carboxylation and the initial enolization, with little effect on Km for CO2 or ribulose bisphosphate. Position 368 mutants exhibit approximately 1% of wild-type carboxylation but 4-9% of enolization, also accompanied by little effect on Km values. The modest catalytic facilitations elicited by these residues are incompatible with either acting as the crucial base. The enhanced efficiency of the position 368 mutants in enolization versus carboxylation clearly indicates that Ser-368 effects catalysis preferentially beyond the point of proton abstraction. Both sets of mutants bind the reaction intermediate analogue, 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol bisphosphate, stoichiometrically. Ligand exchange from complexes with position 321 mutants is increased relative to wild type, whereas complexes with position 368 mutants are more exchange-inert. Therefore, His-321 may assist stabilization of the transition state mimicked by the analogue."
https://openalex.org/W2115624202,"Using a yeast expression vector system, we have expressed both wild type and six mutated Chinese hamster metallothionein coding sequences in a metal-sensitive yeast strain in which the endogenous metallothionein gene has been deleted. The mutant proteins have single or double cysteine to tyrosine replacements (C13Y, C50Y, and C13,50Y), single cysteine to serine replacements (C13S and C50S), or a single cysteine to alanine replacement (C50A). These proteins function in their yeast host in cadmium detoxification to differing extents. Metallothioneins which contain a cysteine mutation at position 50 (C50Y, C50S, C50A, and C13,50Y) conferred markedly less cadmium resistance than wild type metallothionein, or metallothionein with a single cysteine mutation at position 13 (C13Y and C13S). Wild type and three of the mutant Chinese hamster metallothioneins (C13Y, C50Y, and C13,50Y) were purified from yeast grown in subtoxic levels of either CdCl2 or 113CdCl2. All three of the mutant proteins bound less cadmium than the wild type protein when metal-binding stoichiometries were determined. The one-dimensional 113Cd NMR spectrum of the recombinant wild type Chinese hamster metallothionein was compared to the spectra of native rat and rabbit liver metallothioneins. The close correspondence between the 113Cd chemical shifts in these metallothioneins is consistent with the presence of two separate metal clusters, A and B, corresponding, respectively, to the alpha- and beta-domains, in the recombinant metallothionein. The one-dimensional 113Cd NMR spectra recorded on each of the three mutant metallothioneins, on the other hand, provide some indication as to the structural basis for the reduced, by one, metal stoichiometry of each of the mutant metallothioneins. For the C13Y mutant, it appears that the beta-domain now binds a total of two metal ions whereas with the C50Y mutant, the alpha-domain appears metal-deficient. For the double mutant, C13,50Y, the 113Cd resonances are indicative of major structural reorganizations in both domains."
https://openalex.org/W1484600553,"We have recently shown that the human apoA-II promoter contains a set of 11 distal regulatory elements between nucleotides -903 and -255 and three proximal regulatory elements between nucleotides -126 and -33 that are essential for hepatic and intestinal transcription of the apoA-II gene (Chambaz, J., Cardot, P., Pastier, D., Zannis, V. I., and Cladaras, C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11676-11685). Deletion or nucleotide substitution analysis has shown that alterations in elements L (nucleotides -803 to -773) and K (nucleotides -760 to -743) reduced hepatic transcription to 25 and 20% and intestinal transcription to 8 and 4% of control, respectively, as measured by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays, indicating that these elements play an important regulatory role. Nucleotide substitutions in element AB (nucleotides -65 to -33) reduced hepatic and intestinal transcription to 60 and 36% of control, respectively. The factors that recognize regulatory regions L, K, and AB were analyzed by DNA binding gel electrophoretic and competition assays. This analysis has shown that elements AB, K, and L bind with different affinities to a newly characterized heat-stable factor, CIIIB1, which is a transcriptional activator of the human apoC-III gene (Ogami, K., Kardassis, D., Cladaras, C., and Zannis, V. I. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9640-9646). In addition, elements AB and K bind a heat-labile activity, designated AIIAB1, and element L binds to several CCAAT box binding activities. Mutations in domain L that prevented the binding of CCAAT box binding activities reduced both hepatic and intestinal transcription to 30% of control, indicating the importance of these factors in transcription. Simultaneous nucleotide substitutions that prevented the binding of CIIIB1 activity in elements AB, K, and L reduced hepatic and intestinal transcription to 7 and 6% of control, respectively, suggesting that the synergistic interaction of CIIIB1 (bound to the proximal and distal regulatory elements) with CCAAT box proteins (bound to element L) can modulate the level of transcription of the human apoA-II gene."
https://openalex.org/W1551900782,"Abstract The effect of negative supercoiling on UvrABC incision of covalently closed duplex DNA circles containing either a furan-side monoadduct or a cross-link of 4'-hydroxymethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen at a unique site was examined. The rate of UvrABC incision of these DNA substrates was measured as a function of superhelical density, sigma, for values of sigma between 0 and -0.050. The monoadducted DNA substrate was incised at close to the maximum rate at all superhelical densities, with only a slight stimulation of activity between sigma = 0 and -0.035. In contrast, efficient UvrABC incision of the cross-linked DNA substrate required the DNA to be underwound, and activity showed a linear dependence on superhelical density up to sigma = -0.035. DNase I protection studies show that in the presence of both UvrA and UvrB a protein complex binds to the site of a psoralen monoadduct or cross-link in linear DNA. This UvrA-UvrB-dependent complex binds with similar affinity to both the monoadducted and the cross-linked DNA helices. However, differences in the DNase I footprint on these two DNA substrates indicate that the interaction of this protein complex is different at these two lesions. The addition of UvrC to linear DNA molecules that are saturated at the site of the lesion with the UvrA-UvrB-dependent complex resulted in efficient nicking of the monoadducted DNA, but not the cross-linked DNA. Thus, the properties of a DNA lesion site that lead to UvrAB recognition and binding are not necessarily sufficient to allow incision when all three Uvr subunits are present. We propose that after recognition and binding of a lesion site by the UvrAB complex and prior to incision, the damaged DNA helix undergoes a conformational change such as unwinding or melting that is induced by the lesion-bound Uvr complex."
https://openalex.org/W1563330833,"In an effort to understand the regulation of expression of the mouse type I collagen genes, we have purified to homogeneity a transcription factor, called inhibitory factor 2 (IF-2), that binds to the mouse alpha 1(I) collagen promoter upstream of the proximal CCAAT motif. IF-2 was purified to homogeneity from mouse lymphocyte nuclear extracts by ion-exchange chromatography and two different steps of DNA affinity chromatography, one using the wild-type IF-2-binding site as affinity ligand and one using a mutated IF-2-binding site that has a higher affinity for the factor. Renaturation of active DNA-binding proteins purified through several chromatography steps from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels identified two polypeptides of 120 and 100 kDa, respectively, capable of binding specifically to an IF-2-binding site. DNA transfection experiments of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts using an alpha 1(I) promoter-CAT chimeric gene in which mutations were introduced that either improved or decreased the binding affinity of IF-2 for its recognition site, strongly suggest that IF-2 acts as a transcriptional inhibitor of the mouse alpha 1(I) collagen gene. DNA-binding studies with similar concentrations of purified IF-2 and CBF (CCAAT-binding factor) indicate that CBF inhibits binding of IF-2, whereas IF-2 inhibits CBF binding more weakly."
https://openalex.org/W1607937261,"The calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide gene expresses two different mRNAs by tissue-specific alternative processing. The calcitonin mRNA is produced in thyroid C cells by splicing of the first three exons to the fourth polyadenylated exon. It encodes a protein precursor containing an amino-terminal peptide, calcitonin, and a carboxyl-terminal peptide (CCP I). Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) mRNA is produced in neuronal cells by splicing of the three common exons to the fifth exon and the polyadenylated sixth exon, leading to the production of a CGRP precursor. Our studies concerning the expression of the calcitonin/CGRP gene in human medullary thyroid carcinoma revealed the presence of a new RNA transcript. Amplification by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing showed that the novel transcript is composed of exons 1, 2, and 3, part of exon 4, exon 5, and a polyadenylated exon 6. This transcript contains an open reading frame coding for the known amino-terminal and calcitonin peptides, as well as for a novel calcitonin carboxyl-terminal peptide, CCP II. This third alternative pathway utilizes an internal donor site within the exon coding for calcitonin. The presence of CCP II was demonstrated in plasma and thyroidal tissues of medullary thyroid carcinoma patients, implying that this novel mRNA is actively translated in medullary thyroid carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2051525285,"The adult nervous system is characterized by partial or complete morphological segregation of terminals from different afferent neurons innervating the same postsynaptic target. This segregation is thought to result, in part, from competition between the afferent terminals. To explore the role of the target cell in the spatial distribution of presynaptic inputs, the sensory neurons of Aplysia were cultured either with or without a common target motor neuron. In the presence of a common target, the outgrowth from two different sensory neurons tends to occupy separate postsynaptic regions. When cultured without a target motor neuron, processes from different sensory neurons do not segregate, but rather grow freely along one another. Thus, morphological segregation of sensory outgrowth requires interaction with a target neuron and may reflect competition between presynaptic terminals for a limited number of synaptic sites on the motor neuron, or for a postsynaptic trophic factor."
https://openalex.org/W1592266646,"Abstract We have examined the effects of various analogs of vitamin D on the expression of the aggrecan proteoglycan by an immortalized rat chondrocyte cell line. The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), produced a concentration-dependent reduction in the synthesis of aggrecan as monitored by histochemical staining of the matrix, incorporation of [35S]sulfate, and the level of aggrecan core protein. Other analogs of vitamin D were much less potent or had no activity whatsoever. The reduced expression of aggrecan was caused by a dramatic decrease in the steady-state level of the mRNA coding for the aggrecan core protein. A nuclear run-off analysis revealed that the rate of transcription of the aggrecan gene was not significantly altered by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, suggesting that the metabolite was acting through a post-transcriptional mechanism. Experiments using the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D also supported a nondirect effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the expression of the aggrecan gene. These results suggest that the vitamin D metabolite activates a new pattern of gene expression which results in a more rapid turnover of the aggrecan mRNA. This system should be useful for characterizing the regulation of chondrocyte gene expression by vitamin D."
https://openalex.org/W1548036462,"The kinetics of CO association to and dissociation from the two isomers of monoliganded species alpha ICO beta I(alpha II beta II) and alpha I beta I (alpha II beta COII) has been studied by double-mixing stopped-flow and microperoxidase methods. The monoliganded species were generated by hybridization between excess ferric Hb and alpha CO2 beta +2 or alpha +2 beta CO2 prepared by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results indicated that: 1) there were no significant differences in the reactivities of alpha and beta chains in the first step of ligation; 2) in the second step of ligation there was significant cooperativity in the reaction of deoxyhemoglobin with 0.05 or 0.1 equivalent of CO. Diliganded species were therefore formed in significant amounts. The double-mixing HPLC results suggested that in the second step of ligation alpha chains reacted faster than the beta chains, and the main diliganded species formed was alpha I beta ICO (alpha IICO beta II) or its isomer alpha ICO I(alpha II beta IICO). These results seem to indicate that the reaction of the first CO is mostly random and in the second step of ligation CO binds more to the tetramers in which one beta chain is already ligated: alpha I beta I (alpha II beta II) + CO----alpha ICO beta I (alpha II beta II) and alpha I beta ICO (alpha II beta II) + CO----alpha I beta ICO (alpha IICO beta II)."

The derivatives were chemically characterized by amino acid compositional analysis, sequence analysis, and mass spectrometry. The seven derivatives resulted from combinations of differential modification of the three amino groups in the ELH molecule located at Ile1 (alpha-NH2), Lys8, and Lys36. Of the seven derivatives formed, only one, monobiotinyl Lys36-ELH, was biologically active in eliciting egg-laying activity and altering the electrophysiological activity of the abdominal ganglion neuron R15 and LB and LC cluster neurons. In addition, evaluation of the time course of biotinylation of ELH revealed that the relative rate of amino group reactivity was epsilon-NH2-Lys36 greater than epsilon-NH2-Lys8 much greater than alpha-NH2-Ile1. The slow rate of reaction of the terminal alpha-amino group suggested that it was relatively inaccessible to biotinylation, possibly due to conformational factors or to ion-pair formation with an unidentified carboxyl group. Loss of bioactivity of ELH monobiotinylated on the alpha-amino group, coupled with the unusually low reactivity of the alpha-amino group, provided strong evidence for the importance of the alpha-amino group in ELH function. Furthermore, the development and availability of a bioactive ELH probe should greatly facilitate the isolation, characterization, and localization of the ELH receptor."
