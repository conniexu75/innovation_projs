Such molecules could serve as molecular addresses differentiating the tumor vasculature from those of the normal brain. We have applied Systematic Evolution ofLigands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) against transformed endothelial cells as a complex target to select single-stranded DNA-ligands (aptamers) that function as histological markers to detect microvessels of rat experimental glioma, a fatal brain tumor that is highly vascularized. Both the SELEX selection procedure as well as subsequent deconvolution-SELEX were analyzed by fluorescence based methods (flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy). Of 25 aptamers analyzed, one aptamer was selected that selectively bound microvessels of rat brain glioblastoma but not the vasculature of the normal rat brain including peritumoral areas. The molecular target protein of aptamer III.1 was isolated from endothelial cells by ligand-mediated magnetic DNA affinity purification. This protein was identified by mass spectrometry as rat homologue of mouse pigpen, a not widely known endothelial protein the expression of which parallels the transition from quiescent to angiogenic phenotypesin vitro. Because neoangiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a key feature of tumor development, the presented aptamer can be used as a probe to analyze pathological angiogenesis of glioblastoma. The presented data show that pigpen is highly expressed in tumor microvessels of experimental rat brain glioblastoma and may play an important role in warranting blood supply, thus growth of brain tumors.

Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar). In normal physiological processes, such as wound-healing, angiogenesis is tightly balanced by positive and negative regulators. In several disease states, such as tumor growth, overactive angiogenesis contributes to advancement of disease (2Brower V. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 3Zetter B.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1243-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Positive regulators of angiogenesis are recruited by the tumor to dominate negative regulators to ensure proliferation and organization of microvessel-forming EC. Thus, neoangiogenic EC, associated with tumor development, differ from preexisting, quiescent EC by qualitative or quantitative changes of molecular addresses, which could serve as potential targets for tumor homing diagnostic and therapeutic agents (4Lund E.L.

A series of targets and corresponding antibodies to address the activated endothelium of pathological blood vessels are known (2Brower V. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). But it must been supposed that there are other regulators, so far unknown, to be involved in the complex process of angiogenesis. To define novel molecular addresses of the tumor vasculature, combinatorial chemistry approaches, the libraries of which are not biased by natural mechanisms of selection such as immune tolerance (7Jayasena S.D. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 1628-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar), have been successfully applied to develop antibody fragments by phage display that bind to tumor blood vessels (8Neri D. Carnemolla B. Nissim A. Leprini A. Querzè G. Balza E. Pini A. Tarli L. Halin C. Neri P. Zardi L. Winter G. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1271-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Arap W.

However, peptides require circularization, dimerization, or presentation in the context of a larger protein for binding to a target (13Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). These structural requirements limit the number of potential ligands that can be sampled in an experiment directed against complex targets. SystematicEvolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) is a nucleic acid based combinatorial chemistry procedure that has been used to isolate relatively short high affinity ssDNA or RNA ligands, termed aptamers, to a wide variety of protein or low molecular weight compounds (14Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 294: 505-510Crossref Scopus (8178) Google Scholar, 15Ellington A. Szostak J. Nature. 1990; 346: 550-553Crossref Scopus (7745) Google Scholar). Single-stranded nucleic acids, which can fold into very small and complex three-dimensional shapes with a great diversity of binding specificities, are isolated from a large pool of random sequence molecules (1014-1015 sequences) by reiterative rounds of selection and amplification (reviewed in 16). Here we describe a fluorescence-based SELEX procedure. Using transformed EC as a complex target allowed systematic evolution of fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotides and subsequent in situdeconvolution-SELEX by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy on cryostat tissue sections (Fig. 1). Finally aptamers were generated that function as a histological marker to selectively stain microvessels of experimental rat glioblastoma, a brain tumor that is highly vascularized (17Plate H.P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We present aptamer III.1, a ssDNA-ligand binding to pigpen, a not widely known endothelial protein of the Ewing's sarcoma family that parallels the transition from quiescent to angiogenic phenotypes in vitro (18Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell line YPEN-1 (CRL-222) immortalized by an Adenovirus-12 SV40 hybrid virus (19Yamazaki K. Lehr J.E. Rhim J.S. Pienta K.J. In Vivo ( ATTIK ). 1995; 9: 421-426PubMed Google Scholar),microglial cell line N9 (20Ferrari D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1531-1539PubMed Google Scholar), and rat glioblastoma cell line C6 (21Lampson L.A. Wen P. Roman V.A. Morri J.H. Sarid J.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1018-1025PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). YPEN-1 cells and N9 microglial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented by 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed) to subconfluence, and harvested by carefully dislodging the cells from tissue culture flasks. The high pressure liquid chromatography-purified library contained a central randomized sequence of 60 nucleotides (nt) flanked by 18-nt primer hybridization sites (5′-ATA CCA GCT TAT TCA ATT- 60-nt -AGA TAG TAA GTG CAA TCT-3′; MWG-Biotech AG) (22Crameri A. Stemmer W.P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled 5′-primer (5′-FITC-18C-ATA CCA GCT TAT TCA ATT-3′; 18C denotes an 18-carbon ethylene glycol spacer) and a triple biotinylated (trB) 3′-primer (5′-trB-AGA TTG CAC TTA CTA TCT-3′) were used in the PCR reactions for the synthesis of double-labeled, double-stranded DNA molecules. After alkaline melting, the biotinylated ssDNA strand was separated from the FITC-conjugated ssDNA aptamer by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (M-280 streptavidin dynabeads were obtained from Dynal) according to the supplier's instructions (23Brown, T. A. DNA Sequencing: The Basics, IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford.Google Scholar). FITC- and biotin-labeled primers were synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. Unmodified primers were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All steps with FITC-labeled DNA were performed in light-protecting (ambra) reaction tubes (Eppendorf GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Incubation of cells and tissue sections with the FITC-aptamers was performed in the dark. Selection of ssDNA against YPEN-1 endothelial cells was carried out essentially as described for pure protein targets (14Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 294: 505-510Crossref Scopus (8178) Google Scholar,15Ellington A. Szostak J. Nature. 1990; 346: 550-553Crossref Scopus (7745) Google Scholar, 24Conrad R.C. Giver L. Tian Y. Ellington A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 336-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fitzwater T. Polisky B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 275-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, ssDNA pools were denatured by heating at 80 °C for 10 min in selection buffer (initial round: 1015sequences in 1 ml; subsequent rounds: 200 pmol in 200 μl) containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% NaN3 and then renatured at 0 °C for 10 min. To reduce background binding, a 5-fold molar excess of yeast tRNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and bovine serum albumin (BSA; Merck) were added. To reduce co-selection of ssDNA binding to other cell types, in particular macrophages, counterselection was performed with 3 × 107 N9 microglial cells, a population of brain monocytes, by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in selection buffer. Partitioning of bound and unbound ssDNA sequences was done by centrifugation. To ensure elimination of aptamers against the polypropylene-partitioning matrix of the reaction tubes, tubes were replaced against polyethylene ones after the third round of selection. The counterselected SELEX library was incubated with endothelial cells (106 in the initial round, 105 in subsequent rounds) at 37 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation and three washes with 1 ml selection buffer (with 0.2% BSA), cell-bound aptamers were amplified by PCR (Taq-polymerase and dNTP's were obtained from Promega). FITC- and biotin-labeled primers were used in PCR amplification (28 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 46 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by 10 min at 72 °C). For cytofluorometric analysis FITC-labeled ssDNA was prepared as described above. Aptamers obtained from the eighth round of selection were PCR-amplified using unmodified primers and cloned into Escherichia coli using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmids of individual clones were isolated by alkaline lysis (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and inserts were amplified by PCR. For binding studies of individual aptamers by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, FITC-ssDNA was prepared as described above. Specific EC-binding, FITC-labeled aptamers were monitored in the second and subsequent rounds. After incubation of 105 EC with 200 pmol aptamer in 200 μl of selection buffer (with a 5-fold molar excess of tRNA and BSA), cells were washed twice in 1 ml of selection buffer (with 0.2% BSA), and FITC fluorescence was monitored with a FACScan cytometer (BD Pharmingen) by counting 5000 events. Nonspecific control ssDNA (FITC-18C-96-nt) was prepared from the starting pool by PCR as described above. 5 × 104 YPEN-1 endothelial cells and N9 microglial cells, respectively, were each preincubated with selection buffer containing 1 μg/μl tRNA for 20 min on ice and incubated with 200 μl of denatured and renatured FITC-aptamer solution (0.25 pmol/μl with 1 μg/μl tRNA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice in selection buffer (with 0.2% BSA), and fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry. 2–2.5 × 104 tumor cells (C6 glioblastoma cell line) were transplanted intracranially into Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described (21Lampson L.A. Wen P. Roman V.A. Morri J.H. Sarid J.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1018-1025PubMed Google Scholar). Rats were perfused 23 days after transplantation with phosphate-buffered saline, and brains were removed for cryostat sectioning. Binding of individual FITC-aptamers was analyzed on rat cryostat sections of normal and glioblastoma brain. Tissue sections (10 μm) were preincubated with selection buffer (with 1 μg/μl tRNA) at 4 °C for 20 min and then incubated with FITC-aptamer solution (0.25 pmol/μl with 1 μg/μl yeast tRNA) at room temperature for 40 min. Tissue sections were washed twice in selection buffer (with 0.2% BSA), and fluorescence patterns were analyzed microscopically. For double labeling, cryostat tissue sections of rat brain glioblastoma were stained with aptamer III.1 as described above and subsequently stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) (300 nm, 2–3 min; Molecular Probes) or mouse CD-31 (1 h at a dilution of 1/1000; Dako) with CyTM3 anti-mouse secondary IgG (30 min at a dilution of 1/200; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. After two washes in selection buffer (with 0.2% BSA) fluorescence patterns were analyzed microscopically. Wounding experiments were performed in Petri dishes. The confluent monolayer of YPEN-1 EC was wounded by carefully dislodging cells with a sterile pipette tip. The cells in Petri dishes were cultured for an additional 4 h, washed twice with selection buffer, and subsequently fixated with methanol (10 min, −20 °C; Merck). After incubation of the cell layer with FITC-18C-aptamer III.1 (0.25 pmol/μl with 1 μg/μl tRNA) in selection buffer (30 min, 37 °C), staining patterns were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. 1 mg (100 μl) of magnetic streptavidin beads were coated with 200 pmol of trB aptamer III.1 (MWG-Biotech AG) by incubation in 1 ml selection buffer (30 min, room temperature). As a control, 100 μl of magnetic beads were coated with 200 pmol of unselected FITC-ssDNA (trB-96-nt). 1.5 × 108 Ypen-1 endothelial cells were lysed in the presence of protease inhibitors as described (27Klocker N. Kermer P. Gleichmann M. Weller M. Bahr M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8517-8527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the protein pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of selection buffer, treated by ultra-sonication (0 °C, 20 s), and incubated with aptamer III.1-coated magnetic beads in the presence of a 100-fold excess of tRNA (20 nmol) as an unspecific competitor in selection buffer (total volume 1.5 ml, 0 °C, 15 min). The protein-aptamer-magnetic bead-complex was removed in a magnet stand and washed four times (first wash: 1 ml of selection buffer with 150 mm NaCl; second through fifth wash: 200 μl of selection buffer with 100 mm NaCl with 2 nmol tRNA). Protein is removed from aptamer-coated beads by incubation in 30 μl of 1 m NaCl (0 °C, 30 min) and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after staining with Coomassie Blue. In gel tryptic digestion was performed as described (28Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar) and modified as outlined below. Briefly, the protein band was excised from the gel, fully destained, and digested for 3 h with porcine trypsin (sequencing grade, modified;Promega) at a concentration of 67 ng/μl in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.1, at 37 °C. Prior to peptide mass mapping and sequencing of tryptic fragments by tandem mass spectrometry, the peptide mixture was extracted from the gel by two changes of 50% trifluoroacetic acid/50% water followed by two changes of 50% trifluoroacetic acid/50% acetonitrile. The combined extracts were vacuum-dried. The dried peptides were redissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and purified using a ready-to-go pipette tip filled with C18 spherical silica reverse phase material (ZipTipC18™, Millipore). Peptides were eluted with 10 μl of 50% methanol/1% formic acid, and sequencing was performed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time of flight tandem mass spectrometer (Q-Tof, Micromass, Manchester, England) equipped with a nanoflow electrospray ionization source. Gold-coated glass capillary nanoflow needles were obtained from Protana (Type Medium NanoES spray capillaries for the Micromass Q-Tof, Odense, Denmark). The needle was filled with 3 μl of the sample and subsequently opened by breaking the tapered end of the tip under a microscope. A stable spray was observed applying a needle voltage of 1200–1400 V, a back pressure of 2 p.s.i., and a source temperature of 40 °C. The estimated flow rate was 20–50 nl/min. For nanoflow electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry experiments, fragmentation was achieved by collision with argon atoms. Q1 was set to the mass of interest, and an optimized collision energy was applied. The integration time for the time of flight analyzer was 1 s with an interscan delay of 0.1 s. Database searches (NCBInr, non-redundant protein database) were done using the MASCOT software from Matrix Science (29Perkins D.N. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6814) Google Scholar). SELEX was used essentially as described (30Morris K. Jensen K.B. Julin C.M. Weil M. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2902-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) to generate ssDNA aptamers against Adenovirus-12 SV40-transformed YPEN-1 rat endothelial cells. Commonly used radioactive labeling of nucleic acids (to monitor the enrichment of aptamers in successive SELEX rounds) was replaced by attaching FITC as a fluorescence reporter molecule. The selection was started with a SELEX library of ∼1 × 1015 sequences, each containing a central randomized region of 60 nt flanked by two primer hybridization sites (22Crameri A. Stemmer W.P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To reduce co-selection of aptamers binding to other cell types, counterselection against N9 microglial cells (20Ferrari D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1531-1539PubMed Google Scholar), a population of brain monocytes, was performed prior to each selection round. To monitor the enrichment of specific cell-binding aptamers during selection, SELEX pools of the second and following rounds were analyzed by flow cytometry after incubation with YPEN-1 endothelial cells (Fig.2). Analysis of fluorescence-labeled pools in successive cycles of selection showed a pronounced shift of second round histogram toward higher fluorescence intensity. The histograms of SELEX pools 3–7 showed slow but steady increases in fluorescence intensity and thus enrichment of endothelial cell-binding aptamers. As the utility of a selected pool of nucleic acids to dissect complex systems is contingent upon the ability to quickly identify which sequences are ligands for components of interest within the targeted mixture (30Morris K. Jensen K.B. Julin C.M. Weil M. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2902-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), individual aptamers cloned from the eighth round of selection were evaluated by a two step deconvolution-SELEX procedure: (i) each sequence affinity against the transformed YPEN-1 EC cell line was preevaluated by flow cytometry, and (ii) the selective binding of aptamers to microvessels of C6 brain tumor was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy on cryostat tissue sections of rat brain glioblastoma. Of 25 sequences (FITC-18C-96-nt) tested by flow cytometry, by comparison of endothelial cells stained with unselected ssDNA (FITC-18C-96-nt), 23 showed binding to YPEN-1 endothelial cells. Of these, 16 bound to the pathological microvasculature of C6 glioblastoma, and 7 showed no binding. Aptamer III.1 displayed the most intensive staining of the vasculature exclusively in areas of solid tumor growth and was therefore chosen as the candidate to be further characterized as outlined below. Increased fluorescence intensity of YPEN-1 EC stained with fluorescence-labeled aptamer III.1 (sequence and proposed secondary structure is illustrated in Fig.3 C) by comparison with unselected ssDNA (FITC-18C-96-nt) as a negative control is shown in fluorescence-activated cell sorter histograms of Fig. 3 A. To demonstrate also EC-specific binding by flow cytometry, binding analyzes against N9 microglial cells was performed (Fig.3 B). Histological analyzes of aptamer III.1. is illustrated in Fig.4. FITC-labeled aptamer stained the complex architecture of the pathological microvasculature (Fig.4 A). Counterstaining of cellular nuclei with DAPI (blue) demonstrated selective targeting of microvessels within the cell-rich tumor region but not of vasculature in peritumoral areas (Fig. 4 B). Fluorescence microscopy of rat normal brain after incubation with aptamer III.1 did not show any staining of EC or vessel-associated structures (data not shown). Staining of tumor tissue sections with mouse IgG directed against EC (CD-31, visualized with anti-mouse IgG-CyTM3, red) and subsequent labeling with aptamer III.1 (FITC, green) countersigned the aptamers target as EC (Fig. 4 D). Rat brain tumor tissue sections were analyzed after incubation with unselected FITC-18C-ssDNA and endothelial CD-31 (CyTM3, red) as a control. Fig. 4 C demonstrates negative binding. To get further evidence for aptamer III.1 pathological association, cultured EC were analyzed after wounding the confluent cell layer with a pipette tip. Subsequent staining with aptamer III.1 and fluorescence microscopy showed exclusive up-regulation of the molecular target of aptamer III.1 in endothelial cells next to the lesion, a region that is characterized by increased proliferation compared with areas of adjacent contact-inhibited cells of the confluent monolayer (Fig.4 E). Thus, our histological data gave strong indication that aptamer III.1 binds an endothelial molecular target that is involved in the process of EC proliferation, a key step of angiogenesis. The molecular target has been isolated by magnetic DNA affinity purification. Solubilized EC proteins were incubated with trB aptamer III.1 beforehand coupled to magnetic streptavidin beads. After thorough washing and subsequent release of aptamer-bound protein in high salt solution, proteins were analyzed by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). Polyacrylamide gel analyses revealed a distinct band migrating at ∼70 kDa in the lane of aptamer III.1, which is absent in the lane containing a product of the control reaction (performed with unselected ssDNA) which revealed one single band of ∼50 kDa. Peptide mass fingerprinting and sequencing of three of the tryptic peptide fragments of the protein by mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry, respectively, were used to identify the aptamer-specific protein as the rat homologue of mouse pigpen protein (67 kDa), a so far, widely unknown endothelial protein that has been considered to parallel the transition from quiescent to angiogenic phenotypes in vitro (31Alliegro C.M. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 255: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To select a brain tumor-homing ssDNA ligand we applied SELEX against Adenovirus-12 SV40-transformed YPEN-1 rat endothelial cell line, thus against a pathologic endothelial target for several reasons (32Pan W.P. Craven R.C. Qui Q. Wilson C.B. Wills J.W. Golovine S. Wang J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11509-11513Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar): (i) it can be supposed that in actively growing endothelial cells the balance between positive and negative angiogenic regulators has been shifted toward the side of regulators required for EC proliferation and thus the transformed endothelial cells bear a profile of molecular addresses predominantly expressed by angiogenic tumor microvessels; (ii) the selection by intact biological entities does not require a full understanding of the complex mechanism of EC proliferation, whereas the selection by an isolated protein is limited to cases in which the proteins have been identified and isolated; (iii) because of structural differences in protein conformation, the aptamers selected to bind the protein in its purified form will not automatically bind the protein embedded in its natural surrounding; (iv) the selection using intact, activated EC give promises in the identification of components that have not been known for their critical role in angiogenesis, (v) moreover, the cellular target allowed fluorescence-based selection thus to monitor the enrichment of cell-binding, fluorescence-labeled ssDNA-ligands in successive pools of selection and amplification by flow cytometry. The eighth round pool was deconvoluted, and single binding of individual aptamers was quantified by flow cytometry (33Koch C.J. Evans S.M. Lord E.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34Davis K.A. Abrams B. Lin Y. Jayasena S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 35Hicke B.J. Watson S.R. Koenig A. Lynott C.K. Bargatze R.F. Chang Y.F. Ringquist S. Moon-McDermott L. Jennings S. Fitzwater T. Han H.L. Varki N. Albinana I. Willis M.C. Varki A. Parma D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2688-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 36Davis K.A. Lin Y. Abrams B. Jayasena S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Further, screening of these individual aptamers on cryostat brain tissue sections allowed deconvolution for their discriminatory binding to neoangiogenic tumor microvessels but not to vessels of the normal rat brain. Thus histological staining allowed the selection of those aptamer candidates recognizing the differentiation of endothelial cells under in vivoconditions of angiogenesis. These two steps of library deconvolution result in aptamer libraries selectively addressing molecular structures, differentiating neoangiogenic endothelium of the brain. The alignment of the 16 aptamer sequences after eight cycles of systematic evolution and the two subsequent steps of deconvolution did not reveal any obvious binding motifs. This appears to be due to the complexity of the endothelial cell with its high number of potential molecular targets. However, the combination of fluorescence-based SELEX and deconvolution-SELEX allowed identification of aptamer candidates, which perform the desired task to act as a histological marker to selectively stain tumor microvessels. Aptamers were used as histological markers in combination with chromosomal dyes and conventional antibodies for immunostaining. This demonstrates that aptamers are versatile tools that rival antibodies in diagnostic applications (reviewed in 7). Unlike antibodies, synthetic aptamers can easily be produced with a high degree of accuracy, reproducibility ,and purity. Therefore, little or no batch to batch variation is expected in aptamer production. They are not sensitive to temperature and undergo reversible denaturation, thus having a much longer self-life (7Jayasena S.D. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 1628-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). Further, aptamers can easily be conjugated to a variety of reporter molecules, chemotherapeutics, or photosensibilisators at precise locations. Thus aptamers selectively binding to tumor endothelium might be of value not only in the development of tumor-homing diagnostics but also in therapeutics. The pronounced and selective staining of rat brain tumor vessels by aptamer III.1 suggested a selective addressing of a molecule involved in neoangiogenesis. We therefore used this aptamer to purify and identify its binding partner, the rat homologous of mouse endothelial pigpen protein. Previous cell culture experiments (18Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Alliegro C.M. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 255: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) demonstrate pigpen to be synthesized at barely detectable levels in non-proliferating EC, whereas its expression is up-regulated under conditions where EC are actively migrating and dividing (i.e. in subconfluent or wounded cultures) (18Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our observation that the pigpen molecule is highly up-regulated in angiogenic microvessels suggests pigpen as a target for diagnostic imaging or therapeutic strategies in vivo. The combinatorial chemistry procedure SELEX, applied to select ssDNA ligands against transformed EC as intact biological entities followed by deconvolution-SELEX and aptamer-mediated target identification, has demonstrated its potential to identify compounds that are unknown or have not been supposed in probably playing a key role in complex mechanisms like angiogenesis (30Morris K.

Here we report that EETs have additional fibrinolytic properties. In vascular endothelial cells, physiological concentrations of EETs, particularly 11,12-EET, or overexpression of the endothelial epoxygenase, CYP2J2, increased tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) expression by 2.5-fold without affecting plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression. This increase in t-PA expression correlated with a 4-fold induction in t-PA gene transcription and a 3-fold increase in t-PA fibrinolytic activity and was blocked by the CYP inhibitor, SKF525A, but not by the calcium-activated potassium channel blocker, charybdotoxin, indicating a mechanism that does not involve endothelial cell hyperpolarization. The t-PA promoter is cAMP-responsive, and induction of t-PA gene transcription by EETs correlated with increases in intracellular cAMP levels and, functionally, with cAMP-driven promoter activity. To determine whether increases in intracellular cAMP levels were due to modulation of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, we assessed the effects of EETs on Gαs and Gαi2. Treatment with EETs increased Gαs, but not Gαi2, GTP-binding activity by 3.5-fold. These findings indicate that EETs possess fibrinolytic properties through the induction of t-PA and suggest that endothelial CYP2J2 may play an important role in regulating vascular hemostasis.

The EETs have properties similar to those of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor because they hyperpolarize and relax vascular smooth muscle cells by activating calcium-sensitive potassium (KCa2+) channels (4Campbell W.B. Gebremedhin D. Pratt P.F. Harder D.R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 5Campbell W.B. Harder D.R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recently, two CYP epoxygenases, CYP2C8 and CYP2J2, have been identified in vascular endothelial cells (1Fisslthaler B. Popp R. Kiss L. Potente M. Harder D.R. Fleming I. Busse R. Nature. 1999; 401: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 6Node K. Huo Y. Ruan X. Yang B. Spiecker M. Ley K. Zeldin D.C. Liao J.K. Science. 1999; 285: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Although both enzymes produce EETs, the regulation of CYP2C8 and CYP2J2 appears to be somewhat different, and their products may exert additional nonvasodilatory effects. For example, Fisslthaler et al. (1Fisslthaler B. Popp R. Kiss L. Potente M. Harder D.R. Fleming I. Busse R. Nature. 1999; 401: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) have shown that treatment of porcine coronary artery endothelial cells in vitro with β-naphthoflavone induces CYP2C8 expression, increases 11,12-EET biosynthesis, and enhances endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated coronary artery relaxation. However, β-naphthoflavone does not induce the CYP2J subfamily enzymes (7Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J. Steenbergen C. Falck J.R. Moomaw C.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12551-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently reported that EETs possess anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of the proinflammatory transcriptional factor, NF-κB (6Node K. Huo Y. Ruan X. Yang B. Spiecker M. Ley K. Zeldin D.C. Liao J.K. Science. 1999; 285: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). In contrast to their vasodilatory effects, the anti-inflammatory effects of EETs do not involve endothelial cell hyperpolarization. These studies, therefore, indicate that EETs have multiple homeostatic effects on the vascular wall in addition to their vasodilatory effects. An interesting observation is that endogenous vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) frequently possess anti-inflammatory (8De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar), antithrombotic (9Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Lancet. 1987; 2: 1057-1058Abstract PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), and antiproliferative properties (10von der Leyen H.E. Gibbons G.H. Morishita R. Lewis N.P. Zhang L. Nakajima M. Kaneda Y. Cooke J.P. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Indeed, vasoconstriction, smooth muscle cell proliferation, inflammation, and thrombosis are hallmarks of atherosclerotic vascular disease (11Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9956) Google Scholar). In particular, the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques with ensuing occlusive thrombosis is the predominant feature underlying acute coronary syndromes (12Libby P. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2844-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that EETs may play an additional role in the regulation of vascular hemostasis. Vascular thrombosis is regulated, in part, by endogenous mediators such as the proteolytic enzyme, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 (13Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1980; 43: 77-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of t-PA is to convert plasminogen to a proteolytic enzyme, plasmin, which digests fibrin-dependent blood clots. Thus, thrombotic vascular complications may be attenuated by agents that increase the secretion of t-PA and/or decrease the expression of PAI-1. Indeed, the plasma level of t-PA has been shown to be inversely correlated with the risk of myocardial infarction (14Ridker P.M. Vaughan D.E. Stampfer M.J. Manson J.E. Hennekens C.H. Lancet. 1993; 341: 1165-1168Abstract PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine whether EETs could regulate t-PA or PAI-1 expression and, if so, by what mechanism. All standard culture reagents were obtained from JRH Bioscience (Lenexa, KS). Ascorbic acid, creatinine phosphate, phosphocreatine kinase, GTPγS, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, dithiothreitol, bovine serum albumin, ATP, GDP, GTP, charybdotoxin, H-89, and SKF525A were purchased from Sigma. Triphenylphosphine, α-bromo-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorotoluene,N,N-diisopropylethylamine, andN,N-dimethylformamide were purchased from Aldrich. [1-14C]arachidonic acid, [γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol), [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and the polyclonal rabbit antiserum to Gαs (RM/1) were supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The polyclonal rabbit antiserum P4 was raised against a decapeptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal region of Gαi2 and has been characterized previously (15Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Protein molecular weight markers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The chemiluminescence detection kit was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (pore size 0.2 μm) was obtained from Bio-Rad. The heterologous 4×-CRE promoter luciferase reporter construct (pCRE-Luc) was purchased from Stratagene (San Diego, CA). Endothelial cells were harvested from human saphenous veins and bovine aortas as described (8De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K.

The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 5 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and an antibiotic mixture of penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and Fungizone (250 ng/ml). Relatively pure (>95%) endothelial cell cultures were confirmed by Nomarski optical microscopy (Olympus IX70, × 40 objective) and by immunofluorescence staining with anti-factor VIII antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). All passages were performed with a disposable cell scraper (Costar), and only endothelial cells of less than six passages were used. Confluent endothelial cells (∼2 × 106 for human and ∼5 × 106 for bovine) were treated with various concentrations of EETs for the indicated time intervals. The method used to quantify endogenous EETs present in bovine aortic endothelial cells was similar to those used to quantify EETs in tissue preparations (7Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B.

Briefly, 8 × 106 endothelial cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing triphenylphosphine (10 mg), and the homogenate was extracted under acidic conditions with two volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and twice more with an equal volume of chloroform. The combined organic phases were evaporated in tubes containing mixtures of 1-14C-labeled 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET internal standards (57 μCi/μmol; 30 ng each), which were synthesized from [1-14C]arachidonic acid by nonselective epoxidation (18Falck J.R. Yadagiri P. Capdevila J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Saponification to recover phospholipid-bound EETs was followed by silica column purification. The eluent, containing a mixture of radiolabeled internal standards and total endogenous EETs, was resolved into individual regioisomers by HPLC as described (7Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S.

For analysis, aliquots of individual EET-PFB esters were dissolved in dodecane and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as described (7Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J.

Quantifications were made by selected ion monitoring at m/z 319 (loss of PFB from endogenous EET-PFB) and m/z 321 (loss of PFB from [1-14C]EET-PFB internal standard). The EET-PFB/[1-14C]EET-PFB ratios were calculated from the integrated values of the corresponding ion current intensities. The amounts of t-PA and PAI-I antigens expressed by endothelial cells were determined using the Imulyse™ reagent kits from Biopool (Umea, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The t-PA activity in endothelial cell supernatants was determined by a chromogenic assay (Spectrolyse/Fibrin; Biopool). The t-PA in the supernatant from conditioned cells was bound using a specific t-PA monoclonal antibody (SP-322). Preliminary studies indicate that the SP-322 antibody completely bound all of the t-PA without affecting subsequent t-PA activity. The t-PA substrate consisting of plasminogen, plasmin-sensitive chromogenic substrate, and co-factors for t-PA activity (HEPES buffer, pH 8.5) were added to the bound t-PA, and absorption was read at 405 nm. The standard curve was constructed using human single-chain t-PA, which has been calibrated against an international standard for t-PA (Lot 66570; NIBSC, Hartfordshire, UK). Equal amounts of total RNA (20 μg) were separated by 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred overnight onto Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary action, and baked for 2 h at 80 °C before prehybridization. Radiolabeling of full-length human t-PA or PAI-1 cDNA was performed using random hexamer priming, [α-32P]CTP, and Klenow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were hybridized with the indicated probes overnight at 45 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 2.5× Denhardt's solution, 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. All Northern blots were subjected to stringent washing conditions (0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C) before autoradiography with intensifying screen at 80 °C for 24–72 h. Equalization of RNA loading was assessed by ethidium bromide staining of 18 S ribosomal RNA. Partially purified membranes were prepared from endothelial cells as previously described (19Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins (30 μg) from control and EET-treated endothelial cells were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing [35S]GTPγS (20 nm), GTP (2 μm), MgCl2 (5 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), NaCl (50 mm), creatine phosphate (4 mm), phosphocreatine kinase (5 units), ATP (0.1 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), aprotinin (50 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (0.2%), and triethanolamine HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4). In some samples, membrane was stimulated with the α2-adrenergic agonist, UK14304 (10 nm), for 10 min. The assay was terminated after 30 min with excess unlabeled GTPγS (100 μm). Samples were then resuspended in 100 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing Triton X-100 (1%), SDS (0.1%), NaCl (150 mm), EDTA (5 mm), Tris-HCl (25 mm, pH 7.4), leupeptin (10 μg), aprotinin (10 μg), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm). The following G protein antisera with their corresponding final dilutions were added to the mixture: Gαi2 (P4, 1:20) and Gαs (RM/1, 1:100). The samples were allowed to incubate for 16 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The antibody-G protein complexes were then incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1 mg/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. Preliminary studies indicated that all Gαi2 and Gαs were completely precipitated by this procedure because Western blot analysis of the supernatant with the P4 and RM/1 antisera did not reveal their presence. The pellets were washed three times in a buffer containing HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.4), NaF (100 μm), sodium phosphate (50 mm), NaCl (100 mm), Triton X-100 (1%), and SDS (0.1%). The final pellet containing the immunoprecipitated [35S]GTPγS-labeled G protein was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (LS 1800; Beckman Instruments, Inc.). Nonspecific activity was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled GTPγS (10 μm). Confluent endothelial cells were pretreated with 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (0.5 mm) for 30 min prior to stimulation with the indicated concentrations of EETs for 5 min. Cells were scraped on ice, pelleted, and resuspended in ice-cold 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (0.5 mm), boiled for 3 min, and frozen at −70 °C. The intracellular cAMP level was determined using a radioimmunoassay kit with radiolabeled cAMP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A standard curve was constructed using increasing amounts of unlabeled cAMP. The human t-PA promoter was obtained by the standard PCR method using a human genomic library (Invitrogen) as template. The following paired primers were used: sense, 5′-CGATCGGTACTTTCGGGATGATTCAAGAGGATTAC-3′; antisense, 5′-CGATCAGATCTGAAAGAAGAGGAGACAGACCCCAAG-3′. The PCR product (3.6 kilobase pairs) containing a 3.1-kilobase pair t-PA promoter was obtained using the following PCR conditions (35 cycles): annealing at 48 °C for 2 min, elongation at 68 °C for 4 min, and denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s. The t-PA promoter was verified by sequence analysis and corresponded exactly to the already published 5′-flanking sequence of the t-PA gene (20Degen S.J. Rajput B. Reich E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6972-6985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The t-PA promoter was then subcloned into a luciferase reporter construct, pGL.2 (Promega, Madison, WI). For cAMP-driven promoter activity, a heterologous promoter (pCRE-Luc, Stratagene) containing four tandem cAMP-response element (4×-CRE) linked to the luciferase reporter gene was used to assess cAMP-dependent gene transcription. The pcDNA3.1/CYP2J2 expression plasmid was prepared as described (6Node K. Huo Y. Ruan X. Yang B. Spiecker M. Ley K. Zeldin D.C. Liao J.K. Science. 1999; 285: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Transient transfections in bovine aortic endothelial cells were accomplished using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (8De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies with β-galactosidase staining indicate that the transfection efficiency was 12–15%. Bovine endothelial cells (60–70% confluent) were transfected with 5 μg of either pt-PA-Luc or pCRE-Luc and 1 μg of pCMV.β-galactosidase construct. Approximately 48 h after transfection, endothelial cells were treated with 11,12-EET and the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H-89, alone or in combination, for 12 h. The luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined by chemiluminescence (Dual-Light, Tropix, Bedford, MA) using a Berthold L9501 luminometer. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. compared with controls and among separate experiments. Paired and unpaired Student's t tests were employed to determine the significance of changes in GTP binding and luciferase activities. A significant difference was taken for p values of less than 0.05. There were no observable effects of synthetic EETs or 11,12-DHET, the hydration metabolite of 11,12-EET, on cell number, morphology, or immunofluorescent staining for factor VIII-related antigens. Cellular confluence and viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion was maintained for all treatment conditions described. We have previously shown that bovine endothelial cells metabolize radiolabeled arachidonic acid to epoxygenase products (EETs and DHETs) and that endothelial EET biosynthesis is augmented by transfection with an expression vector containing the CYP2J2 cDNA (6Node K. Huo Y. Ruan X. Yang B. Spiecker M. Ley K. Zeldin D.C. Liao J.K. Science. 1999; 285: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Using a combination of HPLC and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques, we detected EETs as endogenous constituents of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (TableI). Endothelial cells contained 7.98 ± 0.90 ng of EET per 107 cells. The 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET regioisomers were each present in roughly equal amounts (40, 28, and 32% of total EETs, respectively). The labile 5,6-EET suffers extensive decomposition during the extraction and purification process used and therefore cannot be quantified. Transfection of endothelial cells with the pcDNA3.1 vector containing the CYP2J2 cDNA resulted in a significant 30% increase in total EETs that was due largely due to increases in 11,12- and 8,9-EET (Table I). Treatment of CYP2J2-transfected cells with SKF525A (100 μm) significantly reduced total EETs to control levels. The documentation of EETs in endothelial cells provides direct evidence to support the epoxidation of endogenous arachidonic acid pools by endothelial cytochrome P450s.Table IEndogenous EETs in control and CYP2J2-transfected endothelial cells14,15-EET11,12-EET8,9-EETTotal EETsControl2.53 ± 0.362.24 ± 0.273.21 ± 0.397.98 ± 0.90CYP2J22.67 ± 0.523.03 ± 0.26*4.72 ± 0.48*10.42 ± 0.46*CYP2J2 + SKF525A2.44 ± 0.112.34 ± 0.022.19 ± 0.026.95 ± 0.11Control bovine endothelial cells, endothelial cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/CYP2J2, or endothelial cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/CYP2J2 and treated with SKF525A were used to quantify endogenous 14,15-EET, 11,12-EET, and 8,9-EET as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Concentration values (ng of EET/107 cells) are averages of 3–8 determinations and are expressed as mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 by analysis of variance. Open table in a new tab Control bovine endothelial cells, endothelial cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/CYP2J2, or endothelial cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/CYP2J2 and treated with SKF525A were used to quantify endogenous 14,15-EET, 11,12-EET, and 8,9-EET as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Concentration values (ng of EET/107 cells) are averages of 3–8 determinations and are expressed as mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 by analysis of variance. In a concentration-dependent manner, treatment of endothelial cells with physiologically relevant concentrations of 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, 14,15-EET, or 11,12-DHET (1–1000 nm, 24 h) increased t-PA protein levels (Fig. 1 A). Maximal increase was achieved with 11,12-EET at 100 nm. Interestingly, 14,15- and 8,9-EET induced significantly less t-PA expression than 11,12-EET, indicating differential bioactivity of specific EET regioisomers. The increase in t-PA protein levels by 11,12-EET correlated with increases in t-PA steady-state mRNA levels (Fig. 1 B). Concentrations of 10 and 100 nm 11,12-EET increased t-PA mRNA levels by 40 ± 5 and 95 ± 6%, respectively (p < 0.05 for both,n = 3). Consistent with effects on t-PA protein levels, a higher concentration of 11,12-EET (i.e. 1000 nm) also did not produce any further increase in t-PA mRNA levels. Interestingly, the increase in t-PA mRNA expression was not due to the membrane hyperpolarizing effects of EETs, since the selective KCa2+ blocker, charybdotoxin (100 nm), was unable to inhibit the increase in t-PA expression by 11,12-EET. The increase in t-PA expression by 11,12-EET correlated with a 2.8-fold increase in t-PA fibrinolytic activity (Fig.2 A). Maximal t-PA fibrinolytic activity was observed at 100 nm 11,12-EET. However, 10 nm 11,12-EET, which produced a smaller increase in t-PA expression compared with that of 100 nm, did not produce significant increases in t-PA fibrinolytic activity. This may be due to endogenous levels of PAI-1, which is known to bind and inhibit t-PA (13Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1980; 43: 77-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to t-PA, EETs have no effect on PAI-I protein levels (Fig. 2 B). These findings suggest that treatment with EETs would favor fibrinolysis by increasing the ratio of t-PA to PAI-1. In a time-dependent manner, 11,12-EET (100 nm) increased t-PA protein levels with maximal increase occurring after 24 h of exposure (Fig.3 A). This increase in t-PA expression was attenuated by co-treatment with the translational inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX; 5 μmol/liter), indicating that 11,12-EET does not promote the release of already synthesized t-PA but that de novo protein synthesis was required. Since t-PA expression is known to be induced by agents or conditions that increase cAMP-dependent pathways (21Nakagawa J. von der Ahe D. Pearson D. Hemmings B.A. Shibahara S. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2460-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Santell L. Levin E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16802-16808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sumpio B.E. Chang R. Xu W.J. Wang X.J. Du W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1441-C1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether the induction of t-PA expression by EETs was mediated by the cAMP-dependent kinase such as PKA. Co-treatment with the PKA inhibitor, H-89 (30 μm), almost completely inhibited EET-induced t-PA expression (Fig. 3 B). Again, the selective KCa2+ blocker, charybdotoxin (100 nm), was unable to inhibit the increase in t-PA expression by 11,12-EET, suggesting a nonhyperpolarizing effect of EETs on t-PA expression. Using a 3.1-kilobase pair human t-PA promoter linked to a luciferase reporter (pt-PA.Luc), we found that 11,12-EET and, to a lesser extent, 11,12-DHET increased t-PA promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). A maximal 4.3-fold increase in t-PA promoter activity by 11,12-EET occurred at a concentration of 100 nm with an EC50 value of ∼10 nm. To determine whether overexpression of the endothelial cytochrome P450 isoform, CYP2J2, which produces EETs, can increase t-PA gene transcription, endothelial cells were transiently co-transfected with pcDNA3.1/CYP2J2 cDNA. We have previously shown that, compared with endothelial cells transfected with the empty vector, CYP2J2-transfected endothelial cells produce epoxygenase metabolites at a 2–3-fold higher rate and that this increase was almost completely inhibited by SKF525A (6Node K. Huo Y. Ruan X. Yang B. Spiecker M. Ley K. Zeldin D.C. Liao J.K. Science. 1999; 285: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Compared with transfection with the empty vector (pcDNA3.1), transfection with CYP2J2 caused a 5.2-fold induction in t-PA promoter activity, which was almost completely blocked by the nonspecific cytochrome P450 epoxygenase inhibitor, SKF525A (Fig. 4 B). The KCa2+ blocker charybdotoxin, however, had no effect on EET-induced t-PA promoter activity. These findings suggest that CYP2J2-derived eicosanoids increase t-PA gene transcription. The induction of t-PA gene transcription is regulated, in part, by increases in intracellular cAMP (21Nakagawa J. von der Ahe D. Pearson D. Hemmings B.A. Shibahara S. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2460-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Santell L. Levin E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16802-16808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sumpio B.E. Chang R. Xu W.J. Wang X.J. Du W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1441-C1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that EETs, particularly 11,12-EET, increased intracellular cAMP levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). Treatment with 11,12-EET (100 nm) produced a 3-fold increase in intracellular cAMP levels (3.1 ± 0.2 to 10.2 ± 0.7 pmol/500,000 cells;p < 0.01, n = 3). To address the question of whether the increase in intracellular cAMP by 11,12-EET can lead to transactivation of cAMP-response element (CRE)-containing promoters, we transfected endothelial cells with a heterologous luciferase reporter construct containing four tandem CREs (pCRE-Luc). Treatment of transfected endothelial cells with 11,12-EET (1–1000 nm, 12 h) increased pCRE-Luc activity by up to 6.8-fold (p < 0.01, n = 4), with maximal effect occurring at a concentration of 100 nm (Fig.5 B). These findings suggest that increases in intracellular cAMP levels and induction of cAMP-responsive trans-acting factors mediate increases in t-PA expression by EETs. In support of the role of cAMP in CRE-mediated gene transcription, we found that the increase in pCRE-Luc activity by 11,12-EET (100 nm) was inhibited in a time-dependent manner by inhibition of the cAMP-dependent kinase, PKA (Fig.6 A). Treatment with the PKA inhibitor, H-89, decreased 11,12-EET-induced CRE promoter activity by 70% after 24 h. To determine whether endogenous EETs produced by CYP2J2 can increase CRE promoter activity, we co-transfected endothelial cells with pcDNA3.1/CYP2J2. Compared with transfection with the empty pcDNA3.1 vector, overexpression of pcDNA3.1/CYP2J2 increased CRE promoter activity by 7.3-fold after 12 h (Fig. 6 B). This effect was almost completely blocked in the presence of the cytochrome P450 inhibitor, SKF525A. These findings suggest that CYP2J2-derived eicosanoids can functionally increase CRE promoter activity. To determine the whether the increase in cAMP is due to the effects of EETs on G proteins, we measured Gαi2 and Gαs GTP binding activities in membranes from endothelial cells treated with EETs. Treatment with 11,12-EET (10–1000 nm, 5 min) caused a progressive increase in Gαs GTP-binding activity with a maximal 3-fold increase (6.1 ± 2.1 to 18.5 ± 1.2 fmol/min/mg, p < 0.01, n = 3) occurring at a concentration of 100 nm (Fig.7 A). In contrast, the same membrane from 11,12-EET-treated cells did not demonstrate any change in basal Gαi2 GTP-binding activity. UK14304 stimulated Gαi2 GTP-binding activity by ∼7-fold (2.8 ± 0.1 to 19 ± 3 fmol/min/mg, p < 0.01,n = 3), which was unaffected by 11,12-EET treatment. Other EET regioisomers such as 5,6-EET, 14,15-EET, and 8,9-EET also increased Gαs GTP-binding activity, albeit to a lesser extent compared with 11,12-EET, without affecting Gαi2activity (Fig. 7 B). These findings suggest that the effects of EETs on cAMP levels, CRE promoter activity, and t-PA expression/activity are probably mediated by their stimulatory effects on Gαs. We have shown that EETs, particularly 11,12-EET, increase endothelial t-PA expression and activity by a transcriptional mechanism involving activation of Gαs. The activation of Gαs leads to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, increase in intracellular cAMP, and induction of cAMP-dependent promoter activity. The effect of EETs on Gαs activity is rather specific, since EETs did not affect basal or UK14304-stimulated Gαi2 activity. Because Gαi2 is specifically coupled to UK14304-stimulated α2-adrenergic receptor in vascular endothelial cells (24Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19528-19533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that EETs selectively modulate Gαs activity. The net effect of EETs on G proteins, therefore, is to favor receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. Indeed, inhibition of cAMP-dependent PKA inhibits EET-induced t-PA expression and CRE promoter activity. These findings are in agreement with previous studies that showed that arteriolar vasodilation by sulfonimide analogs of 11,12-EET analogs is associated with elevation in intracellular cAMP levels and increase in PKA activity (25Imig J.D. Inscho E.W. Deichmann P.C. Reddy K.M. Falck J.R. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 408-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which EETs alter membrane signal transduction and increase t-PA expression is not known. Previous studies have shown that 11,12-EET stimulates the ADP-ribosylation of a number of intracellular proteins in vascular smooth muscle including Gαs (26Li P.L. Chen C.L. Bortell R. Campbell W.B. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Seki K. Hirai A. Noda M. Tamura Y. Kato I. Yoshida S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Indeed, the binding of 14,15-EET to its putative receptor in U937 cells leads to the increase in cAMP levels and PKA activity and subsequently to a decrease in its receptor binding (28Wong P.Y. Lai P.S. Shen S.Y. Belosludtsev Y.Y. Falck J.R. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1997; 16: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that EET-induced ADP-ribosylation of Gαs results in the activation of Gαssimilar to that of cholera toxin. Although we cannot exclude the additional possibility that EETs may induce similar changes in other G proteins, these effects of EETs are unlikely given that Gαi2 activity was not affected. It is also possible that EETs may induce changes in the level of Gαs and Gαi2. However, under the conditions of our study, the observed changes in Gαs activity and cAMP levels occurred within 5 min; which is somewhat rapid for a transcriptional effect on G proteins. Nevertheless, the downstream effect of cAMP is dependent uponde novo protein synthesis, since the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, was able to attenuate EET-induced t-PA expression. The regulation of gene transcription by cAMP is mediated bytrans-acting factors, which bind to cAMP-response element (CRE) (5′-ATGACGTCAT-3′) of target genes (29Nagamine Y. Reich E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although the consensus sequence for CRE is not present in the t-PA promoter, a functional CRE-like element has been identified, which acts synergistically with a putative AP-2 binding site to induced t-PA gene transcription by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (22Santell L. Levin E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16802-16808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, previous studies have shown that cholera toxin and dibutyryl-cAMP can directly induce t-PA gene transcription in rat hepatocytes (30Nagy L.E. DeSilva S.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Uno S. Nakamura M. Ohomagari Y. Matsuyama S. Seki T. Ariga T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously shown that low concentrations of alcohol enhance isoproterenol-induced t-PA gene transcription via increase in cAMP levels and induction of CRE promoter activity in vascular endothelial cells (32Miyamoto A. Yang S.X. Laufs U. Ruan X.L. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12055-12060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These studies, therefore, suggest that the activation of CRE and CRE-binding protein(s) may play an important role in mediating the induction of t-PA by EETs. The vasodilatory effect of EETs, which resemble endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, is mediated by activation of KCa2+ channels and subsequent hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle membranes (4Campbell W.B. Gebremedhin D. Pratt P.F. Harder D.R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 5Campbell W.B. Harder D.R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The anti-inflammatory effect of EETs involves inhibition of cellular adhesion molecule expression via inhibition of NF-κB activation (6Node K. Huo Y. Ruan X. Yang B. Spiecker M. Ley K. Zeldin D.C. Liao J.K. Science. 1999; 285: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The antiproliferative effect of EETs has not been reported, and we do not find that 11,12-EET inhibits platelet-derived growth factor-induced smooth muscle cell or fibroblast proliferation. 2K. Node, X.-L. Ruan, J. Dai, S.-X. Yang, L. Graham, D. C. Zeldin, and J. K. Liao, unpublished data. Our study showed that EETs possess anti-fibrinolytic properties through the induction of t-PA expression. By linking EETs to the fibrinolytic pathway, another important nonvasodilatory action of EETs is suggested, and the homeostatic role of EETs in the vascular wall is broadened considerably because thrombosis is implicated in vascular occlusive disease and atherosclerosis (11Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9956) Google Scholar, 12Libby P. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2844-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar). In this respect, EETs are similar to endothelium-derived NO, which relaxes vascular smooth muscle (33Furchgott R.F. Zawadzki J.V. Nature. 1980; 288: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (9938) Google Scholar), inhibits NF-κB (8De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar), and prevents platelet aggregation (9Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Lancet. 1987; 2: 1057-1058Abstract PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which EETs exert these effects, however, are quite distinct from that of NO, which suggests that cAMP- and cGMP-dependent pathways may work in concert to regulate vascular hemostasis. The finding that EET induces t-PA may have important clinical implications, since the etiology of acute coronary syndromes is thought to be due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture with ensuing vascular thrombosis and occlusion (11Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9956) Google Scholar, 12Libby P. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2844-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar). Our results, therefore, suggest that EETs may lower the risks of cardiovascular disease by augmenting t-PA levels and enhancing the overall fibrinolytic activity in the vascular wall. However, in contrast to the fibrinolytic effect of EETs, other cytochrome P450-derived eicosanoids have been shown to have opposing effects. For example, 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid, an arachidonic acid metabolite that is produced via oxidation and ketoreduction, has been shown to decrease t-PA expression (34Soeda S. Honda O. Fujii N. Shimeno H. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1997; 20: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The concentrations of EETs used in our study are within the range of physiological concentrations of EETs measured in the bloodstream of healthy humans and rats, which is ∼30 nm (16Karara A. Wei S. Spady D. Swift L. Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1320-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that EET levels in human and rat heart tissues are estimated to be 6–7-fold higher (35Rosolowsky M. Falck J.R. Willerson J.T. Campbell W.B. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 608-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and may be even higher during vascular injury and inflammation. In summary, our findings suggest that EETs may play an important role in regulating the fibrinolytic balance in the vessel wall. The potency of EETs' anti-fibrinolytic effects suggests that the biological actions of these cytochrome P450-derived eicosanoids, like those of the prostaglandins and leukotrienes, may be mediated through specific cell surface receptors. The identification and functional characterization of putative EET receptor(s) would greatly aid future research in this field. We thank A. Jetton and T. Murphy for critical reading of the manuscript, J. R. Falck for EET and DHET standards, and S. Degen and D. Luskatoff for human t-PA and PAI-1 cDNAs."

Unlike classical TRAF family proteins involved in TNF family receptor (TNFR) signaling, the TRAF domains (TDs) of MUL, USP7, and SPOP are located near the NH2 termini or central region of these proteins, rather than carboxyl end. MUL and USP7 are capable of bindingin vitro via their TDs to all of the previously identified TRAF family proteins (TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF4, TRAF5, and TRAF6), whereas the TD of SPOP interacts weakly with TRAF1 and TRAF6 only. The TD of MUL also interacted with itself, whereas the TDs of USP7 and SPOP did not self-associate. Analysis of various MUL and USP7 mutants by transient transfection assays indicated that the TDs of these proteins are necessary and sufficient for suppressing NF-κB induction by TRAF2 and TRAF6 as well as certain TRAF-binding TNF family receptors. In contrast, the TD of SPOP did not inhibit NF-κB induction. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy indicated that MUL localizes to cytosolic bodies, with targeting to these structures mediated by a RBCC tripartite domain within the MUL protein. USP7 localized predominantly to the nucleus, in a TD-dependent manner. Data base searches revealed multiple proteins containing TDs homologous to those found in MUL, USP7, and SPOP throughout eukaryotes, including yeast, protists, plants, invertebrates, and mammals, suggesting that this branch of the TD family arose from an ancient gene.

The MULgene has recently been shown to be mutated in patients with Mulibrey Nanism, an autosomal recessive disorder that affects several tissues of mesoderm origin (33Avela K. Lipsanen-Nyman M.

SPOP was previously identified as an autoantigen in a patient with scleroderma pigmentosum (36Nagai Y. Kojima T. Muro Y. Hachiya T. Nishizawa Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All three of these new TRAF proteins have a different topological organization compared with the classical TRAFs implicated in TNF-R and Toll signaling, with the TDs located internally (MUL) or in the NH2-terminal part of the molecule (USP7 and SPOP), instead of the customary COOH-terminal localization seen in the other previously identified human TRAFs.As supportive evidence that these proteins do indeed contain TDs, we demonstrate that these new TRAFs are able to interact with classical TRAF family proteins in vitro and to modulate NF-κB induction by them, at least when overexpressed in cells. However, the physiological role of these novel TD-containing proteins may be directed to purposes other that TNFR- and interleukin 1-receptor/Toll-mediated signal transduction, as discussed herein. Finally, using bioinformatics approaches, we identified several putative TD-containing proteins in diverse eukaryotic species, including yeast, protozoa, slime molds, nematodes, arthropods, and plants, suggesting an early evolutionary origin of the TD and implying roles beyond cytokine receptor signal transduction. We propose the moniker TEFs (TD-encompassing factors) for this large family of proteins. TNF1 receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) constitute a family of adapter proteins first identified for their binding to TNF family receptors (TNFRs). TRAF family proteins regulate several of the functions of the TNFR superfamily, apparently by linking the cytosolic domain of those receptors to downstream protein kinases or ubiquitin ligases (1Arch R.H.

The TD represents a novel protein fold of about 180 amino acids that is the responsible for the interaction of the TRAFs with the TNF receptors and other adaptor proteins and kinases (1Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallographic structures of the TDs of TRAF2 and TRAF3 show that they form an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-sandwich structure, with each TRAF domain monomer containing a surface crevice responsible for binding peptidyl motifs found in the cytosolic domains of the TNF family receptors to which they bind (6McWhirter S.

The protein encoded by the WS gene, WRN, possesses intrinsic 3′ → 5′ DNA helicase and 3′ → 5′ DNA exonuclease activities. WRN helicase resolves alternate DNA structures including tetraplex and triplex DNA, and Holliday junctions. Thus, one function of WRN may be to unwind secondary structures that impede cellular DNA transactions. We report here that hairpin and G′2 bimolecular tetraplex structures of the fragile X expanded sequence, d(CGG)n, effectively impede synthesis by three eukaryotic replicative DNA polymerases (pol): pol α, pol δ, and pol ε. The constraints imposed on pol δ-catalyzed synthesis are relieved, however, by WRN; WRN facilitates pol δ to traverse these template secondary structures to synthesize full-length DNA products. The alleviatory effect of WRN is limited to pol δ; neither pol α nor pol ε can traverse template d(CGG)n hairpin and tetraplex structures in the presence of WRN. Alleviation of pausing by pol δ is observed with Escherichia coli RecQ but not with UvrD helicase, suggesting a concerted action of RecQ helicases and pol δ. Our findings suggest a possible role of WRN in rescuing pol δ-mediated replication at forks stalled by unusual DNA secondary structures.

Indeed, recombinant WRN protein has been shown to possess, in addition to an ATP-dependent 3′ → 5′ DNA helicase activity, an intrinsic 3′ → 5′ DNA exonuclease activity (15Huang S. Li B.

If this is the case, a principle function of WRN helicase may be to resolve alternate DNA structures ahead of the replication fork that would normally impede the progression of DNA polymerases, analogous to the function of the dda helicase in bacteriophage T4 (29Barry J.

Stalling of replicative DNA polymerases could result in polymerase slippage and expansion of the repeat sequence.Here we report that DNA synthesis by several eukaryotic DNA polymerases is blocked by hairpin and bimolecular G′2 tetraplex structures of a d(CGG)7 tract in template DNA. Addition of WRN helicase, however, allows pol δ to traverse these template secondary structures and to synthesize full-length DNA. Further, we demonstrate that the ability of WRN to alleviate polymerase stalling at these secondary structures is specific and limited to pol δ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Enzymes[γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. High performance liquid chromatography-purified and crude oligodeoxynucleotide primer and template, respectively, were synthesized by Operon Technologies. Ultrapure deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) were purchased fromPromega Corp. Bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase was supplied by New England Biolabs.Recombinant hexa-His-tagged WRN protein was purified to >90% homogeneity by the protocol published by Shen et al. (16Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Approximate concentrations of WRN protein were determined from Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Molar amounts of WRN were calculated based on its being a monomer (∼165 kDa). RecQ helicase was kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Kowalczykowski (University of California, Davis, CA), and UvrD helicase was a gift from Dr. Lawrence Grossman (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). S. cerevisiae DNA pol δ and pol δ* were purified to homogeneity as described (44Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); concentrations of pol δ and pol δ* were determined spectrophotometrically atA280. Human DNA polymerase α-primase complex (pol α) and human DNA polymerase ε (pol ε) were the generous gifts of Dr. Teresa Wang (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and Dr. Stuart Linn (University of California, Berkeley, CA), respectively.Preparation of Tetraplex DNAHigh performance liquid chromatography-purified 18-mer primer (5′-d(GCCGGGGCCGGCCGCCGC)-3′) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and boiled to inactivate the kinase. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed from the reaction mixture by precipitating the labeled primer DNA with ethanol. Complementary 61-mer template (5′-d(TATGCCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGATGTAATGCCTCGTCTTGCGGCGGCCGGCCCCGGC)-3′) was purified by electrophoresis through a denaturing 7m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gel (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).The labeled primer (500 pmol) was mixed with an equivalent amount of unlabeled template DNA in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2. The mixture was boiled for 5 min at 100 °C, and the denatured oligomers were allowed to anneal by slow cooling to room temperature. Unlabeled primer was hybridized in parallel to unlabeled template DNA in an identical manner. The labeled primer-template was mixed with unlabeled primer-template to a final DNA concentration of 60 μm in the presence of 300 mm KCl in a volume of 16 μl. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 15–18 h to allow formation of tetraplex DNA. Thereafter, the concentration of KCl was lowered to 30 mm by the addition of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol.Approximately 30-μl aliquots of the DNA mixture were loaded in individual lanes of a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate buffer, pH 8.3, 1.25 mm EDTA) containing 30 mm KCl. The samples were electrophoresed at 4 °C at a constant current of 35 mA to resolve tetraplex forms of the oligomer from residual duplex and single-stranded DNA. Electrophoretically retarded tetraplex DNA was visualized by autoradiography and cut out from the gel. The excised gel slices were suspended in cold TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) containing 100 mm KCl and vortexed at 4 °C overnight. Following separation of gel residue by centrifugation, the extracted DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer, 20 mm KCl. Aliquots of the recovered DNA were stored frozen at −80 °C until use. Concentrations of the isolated tetraplex DNA were estimated from the amount of radioactivity recovered.Preparation of Duplex Hairpin-containing DNA32P-5′-End-labeled 18-mer primer was hybridized to a 2-fold molar excess of gel-purified, unlabeled 61-mer template, as described above. The primed hairpin template was used without further purification in primer extension assays.AssaysDNA Polymerase-catalyzed Primer ExtensionHairpin or tetraplex-containing DNA template (0.5 pmol) was copied by indicated concentrations of DNA polymerases in the absence or presence of known amounts of DNA helicases. DNA synthesis was carried out in reaction mixtures that contained, in a final volume of 10 μl: 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP. Reaction mixtures for the extension of primed hairpin-containing template did not include KCl. Following incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the primer extension reactions were terminated by rapid cooling on ice and addition of denaturing loading buffer (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The samples were boiled for 5 min, and aliquots were electrophoresed through 14% polyacrylamide-urea gels. The gels were dried and primer extension products were visualized by autoradiography or quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics).DNA Helicase ActivityHelicase activity was measured in primer extension reaction mixtures except that 1 mm ATP was present in place of the four dNTP substrates. Radiolabeled tetraplex DNA substrate (0.3–0.5 pmol) was incubated with known amounts of WRN,E. coli RecQ, or E. coli UvrD at 37 °C for 15 min. The unwinding reaction was terminated by the addition of 2.5 μl of a solution containing 40% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 3% each bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Unwinding of tetraplex DNA was monitored by electrophoresis of reaction aliquots through a non-denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE, 20 mm KCl at 4 °C under a constant current of 35 mA, followed by autoradiography, as described (21Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe DNA metabolic processes that WRN participates in are still not clear. However, several lines of evidence point to its involvement in DNA replication. In particular, WS cells exhibit S-phase defects, including a decreased frequency of DNA initiations and a reduced rate of chain elongation (24Fujiwara Y. Higashikawa T. Tatsumi M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 92: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 49Takeuchi F. Hanaoka F. Goto M. Akaoka I. Hori T. Yamada M. Miyamoto T. Hum. Genet. 1982; 60: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these cells are sensitive to the S-phase-specific topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin (26Poot M. Gollahon K.A. Rabinovitch P.S. Hum. Genet. 1999; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The functional and physical interaction of WRN with a major replicative DNA polymerase, pol δ (27Szekely A.M. Chen Y.H. Zhang C. Oshima J. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11365-11370Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Kamath-Loeb A.S. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4308-4603Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) lends additional support for a role of WRN in replication. However, the finding that stimulation of pol δ activity by WRN occurs in the absence of the pol δ accessory factor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (28Kamath-Loeb A.S. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4308-4603Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar), suggested that WRN may not participate in processive DNA replication. This observation, together with the finding that WRN can unwind alternate DNA structures (21Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 22Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C.

In this report we tested this hypothesis in part, by monitoring the effect of WRN on the progression of synthesis by pol δ through replication-impeding hairpin and tetraplex DNA structures.We used bimolecular tetraplex or hairpin formations of the trinucleotide repeat sequence d(CGG)n as model template secondary structures. A d(CGG)ntrinucleotide was first identified in the 5′-untranslated region of theFMR1 gene (50Oberlé I. Rousseau F. Heitz D. Kretz C. Devys D. Hanauer A. Boue J. Bertheas M.F. Mandel J.L.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23090-23096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was implicated in the expansion of this sequence that leads to fragile X syndrome. Hairpin and tetraplex structures of d(CGG)n have also been shown to block the progression of several DNA polymerases both in vitro (41Usdin K. Woodford K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4202-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 42Kang S. Ohshima K. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2875-2878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and in vivo (46Samadashwily G.M. Raca G. Mirkin S.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).We constructed a synthetic d(CGG)7-containing primed DNA template that folds spontaneously into a hairpin structure, or forms a bimolecular G′2 tetraplex structure in the presence of K+ions (Fig. 1). In line with previous reports, we too demonstrate that the template G′2 d(CGG)7 hairpin and tetraplex structures impose a strong barrier to DNA synthesis by three eukaryotic replicative DNA polymerases: α, δ, and ε (Figs. 3 and 4). Extension of a primer by all three DNA polymerases stalls either just before or within the first repeat of the trinucleotide sequence with no product DNA chains discernible beyond this point. Even when the concentration of polymerase is increased such that >90% of the primer is utilized, the initiated DNA chains pause near the start of the tetraplex region (data not shown).Addition of WRN markedly alleviates pausing by pol δ at the tetraplex domain (Fig. 3); a significant fraction of the product constitutes 61-nt-long full-length DNA chains. Several lines of evidence indicate that alleviation of pol δ pausing is a result of the tetraplex d(CGG)n unwinding activity of WRN. First, WRN is able to efficiently unwind the template d(CGG)7 G′2 tetraplex in the presence of dNTPs under conditions employed in primer extension reactions (data not shown). This is consistent with our previous results demonstrating that dNTPs can substitute for ATP in WRN-catalyzed unwinding reactions (19Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Second, the helicase deficient K577M mutant WRN protein that is unable to unwind DNA (16Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 17Gray M.D. Shen J.-C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), also fails to relieve tetraplex-induced stalling of pol δ (Fig. 4). Third, by changing the order of addition of WRN and pol δ, we demonstrate that alleviation of polymerase pausing requires that unwinding of the tetraplex precedes synthesis or occurs simultaneously with DNA synthesis by pol δ (Fig. 3).The ability to complete synthesis past the G′2 tetraplex d(CGG)7 replicative barrier and to generate full-length product DNA chains in the presence of WRN appears, by far, to be limited to pol δ. WRN does not allow pol α or the two-subunit pol δ enzyme, pol δ*, to traverse the template tetraplex structure (Figs. 3 and 5), and only a trace amount of full-length DNA products is observed in reactions containing WRN and pol ε (Fig. 5).The specificity of alleviating tetraplex DNA-induced stalling of DNA polymerase is not only limited to the polymerase used, but also to the helicase utilized for unwinding. Our data show that, similarly to WRN,E. coli RecQ can unwind G′2 d(CGG)7 and allow pol δ to synthesize past the tetraplex, albeit less efficiently than WRN (Fig. 6). This is not totally unexpected since RecQ and WRN belong to the same family of DNA helicases (2Yu C.-E. Oshima J. Fu Y.-H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). Further, these results are consistent with the finding that replicative bypass of hairpin structures in E. coli can occur via a RecQ helicase-dependent pathway (53Cromie G.A. Millar C.B. Schmidt K.H. Leach D.R. Genetics. 2000; 154: 513-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to RecQ and WRN, E. coli UvrD that can also unwind the d(CGG)7 tetraplex does not alleviate pol δ stalling at this secondary structure. Based on these results, we propose that DNA helicases of the RecQ family may serve to resolve tetraplex secondary structures in DNA templates copied by pol δ.Data presented in Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that unwinding of the tetraplex structure by itself is not sufficient to allow traversal of the tetraplex domain by DNA polymerases. Instead, the results suggest a requirement for a concerted action of DNA unwinding by WRN and DNA synthesis by polymerase. The two processes may be coupled through a direct interaction of these proteins. Indeed, a physical interaction between WRN and human pol δ has been reported recently (27Szekely A.M. Chen Y.H. Zhang C. Oshima J. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11365-11370Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The lack of a permissive effect of WRN on replication of tetraplex DNA template by pol δ* indicates that the Pol32p subunit of pol δ is required to couple synthesis with unwinding. These results extend our previous work that implicated Pol32p as an essential component in the functional interaction between WRN and pol δ (28Kamath-Loeb A.S. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4308-4603Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the human pol δ subunit (p50) that has been shown to interact physically with WRN (27Szekely A.M. Chen Y.H. Zhang C. Oshima J. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although seemingly discrepant, these findings are not mutually exclusive. It is conceivable that WRN physically associates with the p50 subunit of human pol δ but requires the p66 subunit (homologue of S. cerevisiae Pol32p) (54Hu"

In vitro, DPPI also activates mast cell chymases and tryptases. To determine whether DPPI is essential for their activation in vivo, we used enzyme histochemical and immunohistochemical approaches and solution-based activity assays to study these enzymes in tissues and bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from DPPI +/+ and DPPI −/− mice. We find that DPPI −/− mast cells contain normal amounts of immunoreactive chymases but no chymase activity, indicating that DPPI is essential for chymase activation and suggesting that DPPI −/− mice are functional chymase knockouts. The absence of DPPI and chymase activity does not affect the growth, granularity, or staining characteristics of BMMCs and, despite prior predictions, does not alter IgE-mediated exocytosis of histamine. In contrast, the level of active tryptase (mMCP-6) in DPPI −/− BMMCs is 25% that of DPPI +/− BMMCs. These findings indicate that DPPI is not essential for mMCP-6 activation but does influence the total amount of active mMCP-6 in mast cells and therefore may be an important, but not exclusive mechanism for tryptase activation.

They have a two-amino acid propeptide (also referred to as the “activation dipeptide”) and an isoleucine at the NH2 terminus of the activated enzyme (2McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation dipeptide maintains the protease in an inactive state. After removal of the dipeptide, the new NH2-terminal isoleucine moves from its position on the surface of the protease to a region in the interior of the enzyme, where it interacts with an aspartate residue near the catalytic center (3Springman E.B.

DPPI was a logical candidate activator of these proteases because it is found in the same cells and is a promiscuous exopeptidase that hydrolyzes most NH2-terminal dipeptides (9McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Studies using the DPPI inhibitor Gly-Phe-diazomethyl ketone reported that DPPI inhibition reduces granzyme A, neutrophil elastase, and cathepsin G activity in the cells (2McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because the inhibitor is not entirely specific for DPPI and does not eliminate the activity of the proteases in question, the possibility remained that another protease was responsible for their activation. This possibility was tested in a DPPI knockout mouse (10Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic lymphocytes of these animals produce normal amounts of granzymes A and B, but both enzymes are inactive and present in their pro-forms. These findings suggest that DPPI is the sole activator of granzymes A and B in vivo.In mast cells, the two major types of serine proteases are chymases and tryptases. Chymases are grouped into α and β types based on structural and functional differences. Humans express α-chymase only. In contrast, mice express five known chymases: the α-chymase mouse mast cell protease-5 (mMCP-5) and the β-chymases mMCP-1, -2, -4, and -9 (11Hunt J.E. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Feyfant E. Sali A.

Chymases possess an acidic activation dipeptide similar to that of most granule-associated serine proteases. Studies using recombinant human pro-α-chymase suggest that DPPI can activate prochymase in vitro by removing the activation dipeptide (6Murakami M. Karnik S.S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2218-2223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Tryptases also are a diverse group of structurally related proteases that include α, β, and γ isoforms in humans (12Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Blount J.L. Hau L.W. Pallaoro M. Wolters P.J. Verghese G.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6566-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Pallaoro M. Fejzo M.S. Shayesteh L. Blount J.L. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3355-3362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and two or three tryptases (mMCP-6, mMCP-7, and transmembrane/γ) in mice (14Wong G.W. Tang Y. Feyfant E. Sali A. Li L. Li Y. Huang C. Friend D.S. Krilis S.A. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30784-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). MMCP-7 is not expressed in C57BL/6 mice, and thus, its expression is strain-dependent (15Hunt J.E. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Zhang J. Xia Z. Ghildyal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2851-2855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Available evidence suggests that activation of tryptases is more complicated than that of chymases and other granule-associated serine proteases. In vitro studies indicate that, after removal of a signal peptide by signal peptidase, human β-tryptase requires two additional, sequential cleavages of its propeptide for activation (7Sakai K. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The first such cleavage is thought to be by tryptase itself, which leaves a two-amino acid activation dipeptide to be removed by DPPI. Whether this sequence of events occurs in vivo is not known. Furthermore, the mechanism of activation of γ-tryptase, which appears to lack an activation dipeptide, may differ from that of the other tryptases.To establish whether DPPI is essential for activating mast cell chymases and tryptases in vivo, we examined these enzymes in DPPI-null mice. We found that mast cells from these mice contain normal amounts of at least two chymases (mMCP-4 and -5), but they and other chymases are completely inactive as determined by enzyme histochemistry and solution-based assays. In contrast, the mast cells contain reduced amounts of normally processed, active tryptase (mMCP-6). Thus, DPPI is required for the processing and activation of chymases, but not tryptases, in mouse mast cells. These findings improve our understanding of the regulation of serine protease activity in mast cells and have important implications for understanding their biological functions in vivo.DISCUSSIONIn this study, DPPI-deficient mice reveal that DPPI is essential for the in vivo activation of mast cell chymases. Surprisingly, DPPI is not essential for the activation of the tryptase mMCP-6, although it does influence the amount of active mMCP-6 in mast cells. These alterations of protease activity do not affect mast cell growth, maturation, tissue migration, or degranulation, indicating that DPPI and chymase are not essential for these processes. These findings suggest a mechanism for the intracellular activation and regulation of a major class of mast cell preformed mediators.Prior studies report that purified DPPI activates human pro-chymasein vitro (6Murakami M. Karnik S.S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2218-2223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26McEuen A.R. Ashworth D.M. Walls A.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mice have five chymases, mMCP-1, -2, -4, -5, and -9 (11Hunt J.E. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Feyfant E. Sali A. Huang C. Ghildyal N. Stechschulte S. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29158-29166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), all with similar measured or predicted activity and primary structure. MMCP-1, -2, -4, and -9 are predicted to have identical propeptides (EE) and mature NH2 termini (IIGG) (11Hunt J.E. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Feyfant E. Sali A. Huang C. Ghildyal N. Stechschulte S. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29158-29166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MMCP-5 also has a similar propeptide (GE) and an identical NH2 terminus (IIGG). Our results show that DPPI is essential for the activation of mouse chymases in BMMCs and mucosal and connective tissue mast cells in vivo. Furthermore, in the absence of DPPI, the chymases exist in an activable pro-form. In our immunodetection studies we focused on mMCP-4 and -5 because the former is the major isoform extracted from mouse skin (21Coussens L.M. Raymond W.W. Bergers G. Laig-Webster M. Behrendtsen O. Werb Z. Caughey G.H. Hanahan D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1382-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), and the latter is the major product of mature BMMCs (27McNeil H.P. Frenkel D.P. Austen K.F. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2466-2472PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stevens R.L. Friend D.S. McNeil H.P. Schiller V. Ghildyal N. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because of the high degree of structural similarity of the chymases, it is likely that our findings are true for all chymases. Furthermore, the absence of CAE-positive cells in DPPI −/− mouse tissues containing mMCP-1, 2, 4, and 5 (28Stevens R.L. Friend D.S. McNeil H.P. Schiller V. Ghildyal N. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 29Scudamore C.L. McMillan L. Thornton E.M. Wright S.H. Newlands G.F. Miller H.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1661-1672PubMed Google Scholar) supports this assertion, since the CAE procedure is an activity-based histochemical approach that detects chymase activity in all known chymase-containing subsets of mast cells in a broad spectrum of mammalian tissues.Our observation that DPPI −/− mast cells degranulate as well as DPPI +/− mast cells indicates that endogenous DPPI and chymase play little or no role in the IgE-mediated release of histamine from BMMCs. These findings are contrary to expectations generated by reports that chymase directly degranulates or potentiates IgE-mediated degranulation (23Kido H. Fukusen N. Katunuma N. Biochem. Int. 1985; 10: 863-871PubMed Google Scholar, 24He S. Gaca M.D. McEuen A.R. Walls A.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schick B. Austen K.F. Schwartz L.B. J.

These reports are based largely on experiments conductedin vitro using inhibitors that are not chymase-specific and potentially non-physiologic quantities of chymase. Also, in vitro findings may fail to predict in vivo behavior of chymases when conducted in the absence of natural chymase inhibitors or using a chymase that is unassociated with the proteoglycans to which chymases are bound to upon release from mast cell granules. Our studies overcome some of these limitations by comparing degranulation using mast cells with and without endogenously synthesized and packaged chymase. However, our findings in mouse BMMCs do not rule out the possibility that chymases modulate mast cell exocytosis in humans or other mammals or in subsets of mouse mast cells expressing a different profile of chymases.Recombinant human β-protryptase can be activated in vitroby two sequential steps of propeptide processing (7Sakai K. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). First, β-protryptase is autoprocessed to the inactive intermediate pro′-tryptase, which has a residual pro-dipeptide. The pro′-tryptase intermediate can then be fully activated by DPPI, which removes the dipeptide. Because of sequence similarities of the pro-region of mMCP-6 to β-tryptase, we expected that mMCP-6 would be inactive in DPPI −/− mouse mast cells and that any immunoreactive protein would be in the pro′ form. To our surprise, enzyme histochemistry showed active tryptase in mast cells of tissues obtained from DPPI −/− mice. This activity is due in part to mMCP-6 because it exists entirely in its normally processed, active form in DPPI −/− BMMCs. This finding is similar to that of granzyme C in DPPI −/− mice. In these animals, 50% of granzyme C is found in the pro-form, and 50% is found in the active form (10Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that DPPI is not essential for the activation of all mast cell tryptases or granzyme C. How mMCP-6 becomes activated and whether tryptase and granzyme C share a mechanism of activation in the absence of DPPI are unclear. One possibility is that mMCP-6 undergoes two-step processing by tryptase and a second protease, possibly an aminopeptidase (31Serafin W.E. Guidry U.A. Dayton E.T. Kamada M.M. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5984-5988Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which compensates for DPPI. Alternatively, mMCP-6 may be activated directly by an endoprotease. Candidates include cathepsins B, L, and S, which are present in BMMCs. 2P. J. Wolters, C. T. N. Pham, D. J. Muilenburg, T. J. Ley, and G. H. Caughey, unpublished data.Our observation that DPPI −/− BMMCs contain less mMCP-6 than DPPI +/− control cells indicates that DPPI influences the total amount of active tryptase in BMMCs. Furthermore, this influence probably is exerted post-transcriptionally, given the equivalence of steady state mRNA levels in the two types of cells. One explanation for our findings is that DPPI normally plays a role in two-step processing of protryptase to an active, protease-resistant form. In the absence of DPPI, tryptase exists in its pro- or pro′-form longer because the compensating protease is less efficient, thereby increasing the time of exposure to degradative enzymes as pro-tryptases traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the secretory granules. This explanation is consistent with prior observations that unprocessed granzymes are susceptible to degradation in DPPI −/− mice (10Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Alternative, less likely explanations are that DPPI processes proteins that regulate the quantity of degradative enzymes or that DPPI directly stabilizes tryptase molecules during biogenesis.Most proteases are synthesized as inactive zymogens that are activated by proteolytic removal of a propeptide. Some proteases autoactivate (e.g. cathepsins L and K), whereas others are activated by a different protease hydrolyzing a specific site (e.g. trypsin activation by enteropeptidase). In some instances, a series of proteases must be activated sequentially before activation of a protease. The best known example of this is the clotting cascade, where sequential activation of proteases culminates in conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. This activation cascade serves two purposes. First, because each active protease activates more than one molecule of zymogen at each stage of the cascade, the final signal (in this example, formation of a fibrin clot by thrombin) is greatly amplified. Second, the sequential activation generates multiple branch points at which the cascade can be regulated. Our finding that DPPI is the sole chymase activator establishes a cascade in mast cells in which DPPI activates chymase, which in turn activates gelatinase B (32Fang K.C. Raymond W.W. Lazarus S.C. Caughey G.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). What remains to be determined is how DPPI itself is activated. Two possibilities are that it is auto-activated in a manner similar to that of the related cysteine proteases, cathepsin L and K (33Menard R. Carmona E. Takebe S. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Mason P.

Defining a cascade of protease activation in mast cells is important because it provides an understanding of how the proteolytic activity and subsequent biological effects of the cascade are regulated.Mutations in the DPPI gene resulting in a loss of DPPI activity are linked to the Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome (35Hart T.C.

Hum. Genet. 1979; 51: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). How the absence of DPPI activity produces the manifestations of the Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome is currently unknown. However, past studies in knockout mice suggest that the predisposition to bacterial infections may be due in part to altered amounts of serine protease activity (10Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 38Belaaouaj A. McCarthy R. Baumann M. Gao Z. Ley T.J. Abraham S.N. Shapiro S.D. Nat.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 201-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The current studies allow us to predict that patients with Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome will have no active mast cell chymase and reduced levels of tryptase.In summary, this report establishes that DPPI is essential for the activation of mouse mast cell chymases in vivo. Furthermore, DPPI regulates the total amount of active tryptase within mast cells, although it is not essential for tryptase activation. These findings further our understanding of the biogenesis of the major preformed mediator proteins of mast cells and suggest a means of regulating their biologic functions in vivo. Granule-associated serine proteases of cytotoxic lymphocytes, neutrophils, and mast cells (i.e. granzymes, elastase, cathepsin G, and chymases) are structurally related (1Caughey G.H. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: S138-S142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They have a two-amino acid propeptide (also referred to as the “activation dipeptide”) and an isoleucine at the NH2 terminus of the activated enzyme (2McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol.

MMCP-7 is not expressed in C57BL/6 mice, and thus, its expression is strain-dependent (15Hunt J.E. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Zhang J. Xia Z. Ghildyal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2851-2855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Available evidence suggests that activation of tryptases is more complicated than that of chymases and other granule-associated serine proteases. In vitro studies indicate that, after removal of a signal peptide by signal peptidase, human β-tryptase requires two additional, sequential cleavages of its propeptide for activation (7Sakai K. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The first such cleavage is thought to be by tryptase itself, which leaves a two-amino acid activation dipeptide to be removed by DPPI. Whether this sequence of events occurs in vivo is not known. Furthermore, the mechanism of activation of γ-tryptase, which appears to lack an activation dipeptide, may differ from that of the other tryptases. To establish whether DPPI is essential for activating mast cell chymases and tryptases in vivo, we examined these enzymes in DPPI-null mice. We found that mast cells from these mice contain normal amounts of at least two chymases (mMCP-4 and -5), but they and other chymases are completely inactive as determined by enzyme histochemistry and solution-based assays. In contrast, the mast cells contain reduced amounts of normally processed, active tryptase (mMCP-6). Thus, DPPI is required for the processing and activation of chymases, but not tryptases, in mouse mast cells. These findings improve our understanding of the regulation of serine protease activity in mast cells and have important implications for understanding their biological functions in vivo. DISCUSSIONIn this study, DPPI-deficient mice reveal that DPPI is essential for the in vivo activation of mast cell chymases. Surprisingly, DPPI is not essential for the activation of the tryptase mMCP-6, although it does influence the amount of active mMCP-6 in mast cells. These alterations of protease activity do not affect mast cell growth, maturation, tissue migration, or degranulation, indicating that DPPI and chymase are not essential for these processes. These findings suggest a mechanism for the intracellular activation and regulation of a major class of mast cell preformed mediators.Prior studies report that purified DPPI activates human pro-chymasein vitro (6Murakami M.

In this study, we have examined the cross-talk between Rac and Rho in relation to the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. NGF induced a rapid activation of Rac1 and suppression of RhoA activity. Constitutively active RhoA, RhoAV14, or constitutively active Gα12-induced endogenous RhoA activation inhibited the NGF-induced Rac1 activation without any effect on the NGF-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Moreover, Y-27632, an inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase, completely abolished the RhoA-induced down-regulation of the NGF-induced Rac1 activation. We also revealed that NGF induced a rapid recruitment of Rac1 to the cell surface protrusion sites and formed filamentous actin-rich protrusions. Activation of RhoA and Rho-associated kinase formed a thick ringlike structure of cortical actin filaments at the cell periphery and then inhibited the NGF-induced recruitment of Rac1 to protrusions. These results indicate that RhoA down-regulates the NGF- induced Rac1 activation through Rho-associated kinase, inhibiting the neurite formation.

Neurite extension and retraction are very important processes in the formation of neuronal networks, and these dynamic morphological changes of neuronal cells are largely decided by the actin cytoskeletal organization (1Tanaka E. Sabry J. Cell. 1995; 83: 171-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The Rho family of small GTPases, consisting of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, has been implicated in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and subsequent morphological changes in various cellular functions (2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Among them, Rac is involved in membrane ruffling and formation of lamellipodia, whereas Rho is responsible for regulating the assembly of focal adhesion and stress fiber formation in fibroblasts (3Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar, 4Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). Similar to other GTPases of the Ras superfamily, they serve as a molecular switch by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. Activation of the Rho family proteins requires GDP-GTP exchange catalyzed by various guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and their activation is regulated by GTPase-activating proteins, which stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activities of the G proteins, leading to the cessation of their actions. In addition, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors inhibit the exchange of GDP for GTP and might also serve to regulate their association with membranes (5Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).

Rac has been shown to be involved in the formation of lamellipodia of a growth cone and to be required for the outgrowth of neurites (14Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of Rho was reported to induce the collapse of the growth cone and the retraction of neurites and to inhibit the neurite outgrowth (14Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 15Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol.

Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 17Chen X.Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, the balance between Rac and Rho activities is likely to be a crucial point for neuronal morphology. The cross-talk between Rac and Rho has been studied in a variety of cell lines, and the physiological significance of the cross-talk has been established in various cellular functions (18Burridge K. Science. 1999; 283: 2028-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). However, little is yet known about the regulatory mechanism of the cross-talk between Rac and Rho. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells have been used as a model system for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth. After stimulation with nerve growth factor (NGF),1the cells stop growing and begin to extend neurites. Rac plays an important role in the regulation of the cytoskeletal changes required for neurite outgrowth in response to NGF, whereas Rho has been shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth by NGF (16Sebok A. Nusser N. Debreceni B. Guo Z. Santos M.F. Szeberenyi J. Tigyi G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the cross-talk between Rac and Rho in PC12 cells, and we showed that NGF induced the Rac1 activation but also the inhibition of RhoA activity and that the activation of RhoA down-regulated the NGF-induced Rac1 activation via Rho-associated kinase.

The sources of other materials are as indicated. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin under humidified conditions in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. PC12 cell line expressing RhoAV14 or Gα12QL under the control of isopropyl-μ-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was obtained as described previously (21Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Negishi M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For transfection, cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips (circular, 13 mm) in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 104cells/well and cultured for 15–18 h. Then cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of total DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed 24 h after transfection. After PC12 cells were rinsed briefly with PBS, they were lysed for 5 min with the respective ice-cold lysis buffers (Rac1 activity assay, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin; RhoA activity assay, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin; ERK activity assay, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell lysates were immediately centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The immunoblots were detected using a chemiluminescence ECL Western blotting system with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Measurement of Rac1 and RhoA activities was performed as described previously (20Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Negishi M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Eighteen-hour serum-starved PC12 cells (Rac1, 3 × 106cells; RhoA, 2 × 107 cells) were lysed for 5 min with the respective ice-cold cell lysis buffer containing 6 μg of the glutathione S-transferase-fused Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain of rat αPAK (GST-CRIB) for GTP-bound Rac1 or 16 μg of GST-Rho-binding domain of mouse rhotekin (GST-RBD) for GTP-bound RhoA. For preparing suspended cells, PC12 cells were detached and kept in suspension in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 10 min before lysis. Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min (Rac1) or 60 min (RhoA) at 4 °C. After the beads had been washed with the cell lysis buffer, the bound proteins were resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using a mouse monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibody (1:1000) or a mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody (1:100). Densitometric analyses were performed using NIH Image software, and the amounts of GTP-bound Rac1 and RhoA were normalized to the total amounts of Rac1 and RhoA in cell lysates, respectively. PC12 cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. All steps were carried out at room temperature, and cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) between each step. Cells on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 20 min. After residual formaldehyde had been quenched with 50 mmNH4Cl/PBS for 10 min, cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min and incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. Endogenous Rac1 was stained with an anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody in PBS at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h followed by incubation with a rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG in PBS at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h. Filamentous actin (F-actin) was stained with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin in PBS (0.5 units/ml) or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin in PBS (1 unit/ml) for 1 h. Cells were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in PBS. Confocal microscopy was performed using an MRC-1024 laser-scanning confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad) equipped with a Nicon Eclipse E800 microscope and a Nicon Plan Apo 60 × 1.4 oil immersion objective. Rac has been shown to be involved in the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (17Chen X.Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Lamoureux P. Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Lin C. Wagner J.A. Heidemann S.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 635-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while active Rho has been reported to prevent the NGF-induced neuritogenesis (16Sebok A. Nusser N. Debreceni B. Guo Z. Santos M.F. Szeberenyi J. Tigyi G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To assess more directly modulation of Rac1 and RhoA activities by NGF, we measured the amounts of cellular GTP-bound Rac1 and RhoA using the GST-fused CRIB domain of αPAK (GST-CRIB) and GST-fused Rho-binding domain of rhotekin (GST-RBD), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, NGF induced a rapid increase in the amount of cellular GTP-bound Rac1, the elevation reaching a maximum at 3 min. The level decreased gradually but remained above the basal level for over 60 min after the stimulation. On the other hand, NGF induced a rapid decrease in the amount of cellular GTP-bound RhoA, the level reaching a minimum at 3–10 min, and it took at least 30 min to regain the basal level. Therefore, NGF oppositely regulated the activities of Rac1 and RhoA, activation of Rac1 and suppression of RhoA. Active Rho has been known to prevent NGF-induced neuritogenesis (16Sebok A. Nusser N. Debreceni B. Guo Z. Santos M.F. Szeberenyi J. Tigyi G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of RhoA activation on NGF-induced Rac1 activation, using the PC12 cell line expressing constitutively active HA-tagged RhoA, HA-RhoAV14, under the control of IPTG, which we had previously established (referred to as “RhoAV14-inducible PC12 cells”; Ref. 21Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Negishi M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The expression of RhoAV14 by IPTG completely inhibited the NGF-induced Rac1 activation without any effect on the basal Rac1 activity in RhoAV14-inducible PC12 cells (Fig. 2). We recently demonstrated that the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins induced activation of endogenous RhoA, causing neurite retraction in PC12 cells (21Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Negishi M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We then examined the effect of endogenous RhoA activation on the NGF-induced Rac1 activation using the PC12 cell line expressing constitutively active Gα12, Gα12QL, under the control of IPTG (21Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Negishi M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The expression of Gα12QL by IPTG completely inhibited the NGF-induced Rac1 activation (Fig. 3), indicating that the RhoA activation pathway is a negative regulator of the NGF-induced Rac1 activation.Figure 3Inhibition of the NGF-induced Rac1 activation by Gα12QL. A, serum-starved Gα12QL-inducible PC12 cells were treated with or without 5 mm IPTG for 12 h, and then they were stimulated with or without 50 ng/ml NGF for 3 min. The cell lysates were incubated with GST-CRIB, and the amounts of GTP-bound Rac1 were determined by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody against Rac1 (upper panel). Total amounts of Rac1 in cell lysates (middle panel) and expression of HA-tagged Gα12QL (bottom panel,arrow) are also shown. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments that yielded similar results.B, quantification of the effect of Gα12QL on Rac1 activity. The Rac1 activity is indicated by the amount of GST-CRIB-bound Rac1 normalized to the amount of Rac1 in whole cell lysates, and values of Rac1 activity are expressed as -fold increase over the value of cells that were not treated with either IPTG or NGF. Data are the means ± S.E. of triplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recent studies have shown that cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix induces activation of Rac (23Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 24Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of Rho has been shown to induce cell rounding in PC12 cells, rendering the cells less adherent (21Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Negishi M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Katoh H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Kitano Y. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28700-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, down-regulation of the NGF-induced Rac1 activation by RhoAV14 might be a secondary effect of RhoAV14-induced reduction of cell adhesion activity. To address this issue, we examined the effect of RhoAV14 on the NGF-induced Rac1 activation in suspended RhoAV14-inducible PC12 cells. NGF induced a rapid increase in the amount of GTP-Rac1 in suspended PC12 cells as well, but the level reached a maximum at 1 min (data not shown). As shown in Fig.4, the expression of RhoAV14by IPTG inhibited the NGF-induced Rac1 activation in the suspended PC12 cells. Thus, the RhoAV14-induced down-regulation of the Rac1 activation is not due to the reduction of cell adhesion activity. NGF has been known to differentiate PC12 cells through the ERK signal transduction pathway (26Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar, 27Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). RhoAV14-induced down-regulation of the Rac1 activation might result from perturbation of the NGF-induced ERK activation. To exclude this possibility, we examined the effect of RhoAV14 on the NGF-induced ERK activation by visualizing phosphorylation of endogenous ERK with an antiphospho-ERK antibody. As shown in Fig.5, the expression of RhoAV14by IPTG did not affect the NGF-induced ERK activation in RhoAV14-inducible PC12 cells, indicating that the RhoAV14-induced down-regulation occurred irrespective of the ERK signal transduction pathway. Rho-associated kinase, one of the downstream targets of RhoA, has been shown to be involved in a variety of actions of Rho (28Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rho-associated kinase was involved in the RhoAV14-induced down-regulation of the Rac1 activation, the cells were treated with a Rho-associated kinase-selective inhibitor, Y-27632 (29Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, Y-27632 had little effect on the basal and NGF-induced Rac1 activation. However, Y-27632 completely abolished the RhoAV14-induced down-regulation of the Rac1 activation in both adherent and suspended RhoAV14-inducible PC12 cells. In addition, Y-27632 also abolished the Gα12QL-induced down-regulation of the Rac1 activation in Gα12QL-inducible PC12 cells (data not shown). On the other hand, Y-27632 did not affect the time course profile of the NGF-induced Rac1 activation (Fig. 6 E). These results indicate that the RhoAV14-induced down-regulation of the Rac1 activation is mediated by Rho-associated kinase. We examined the subcellular distribution of Rac1 and F-actin after the stimulation with NGF. Immunofluorescence staining of Rac1 using an anti-Rac1 antibody revealed that in unstimulated RhoAV14-inducible PC12 cells, Rac1 was present mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig.7). At 3 min after the addition of NGF, RhoAV14-inducible PC12 cells produced a few protrusions from the cell membrane, and Rac1 and F-actin were accumulated at these protrusions. We recently showed that the constitutively active Rac1, Rac1V12, induced membrane ruffles where Rac1V12and F-actin were accumulated, but Rac1V12 failed to induce protrusions in PC12 cells (20Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rac1V12 also induced membrane ruffles in NGF-treated cells and abrogated the NGF-induced straightforward neurite formation (data not shown). However, the expression of dominant negative Rac1, Rac1N17, blocked the NGF-induced F-actin redistribution and the protrusion formation, indicating that Rac1 activation is required for the formation of F-actin-rich protrusion (data not shown). On the other hand, the expression of RhoAV14 gave rise to cell rounding accompanied by formation of a thick ringlike structure of cortical actin filaments at the cell periphery. When the cells expressing RhoAV14 were stimulated with NGF, the thick ring of cortical actin filaments remained unchanged, and formation of protrusions enriched with Rac1 and F-actin was not observed. We next examined the effect of Rho-associated kinase on the NGF-induced accumulation of Rac1 and F-actin by transient transfection of the constitutively active form of Rho-associated kinase, CD-ROKα. Transfected cells were identified by cotransfection of GFP. As shown in Fig. 8, CD-ROKα also induced the cell rounding with cortical actin filaments and inhibited the NGF-induced accumulation of Rac1 and F-actin at the protrusions. Moreover, Y-27632 completely abolished the RhoAV14-induced inhibition of the accumulation of Rac1 and F-actin (Fig.9). These results indicate that RhoAV14 inhibited the NGF-induced accumulation of Rac1 and F-actin at the protrusions and eventually suppressed the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth via Rho-associated kinase.Figure 8Effect of CD-ROKα on the NGF-induced subcellular distribution of endogenous Rac1 and F-actin. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with an empty vector (a--d) or an expression vector encoding CD-ROKα (e--h) along with an expression vector encoding GFP. At 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml NGF for 3 min and were fixed. Transfected cells were identified by the fluorescence of GFP (a, c,e, and g). Cells were stained with an anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody (b and f) or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (d and h).

Cancer. 2000; 36: 1269-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and the actions of Rac and Rho have been shown to counteract each other in a variety of cell lines (14Kozma R.

Contractility by myosin activation has been shown to be antagonistically regulated by Rac1 and RhoA through the action of PAK on myosin light chain kinase and that of Rho-associated kinase on myosin phosphatase, respectively (18Burridge K. Science. 1999; 283: 2028-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the cross-talk is coordinated regulation of downstream functions of Rac1 and RhoA, usually referred to as signal convergence (34Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Such signal-convergent regulation by Rac1 and RhoA was also reported in neuronal cells. Activation of Rho promotes contractility by activation of Rho-associated kinase, leading to neurite retraction, cell rounding, and the inhibition of neurite outgrowth, while activation of Rac enhances cell spreading and neurite extension and interferes with Rho-mediated cell rounding through phosphorylation of the myosin-II heavy chain, suggesting antagonistic roles for Rho and Rac in the control of neuronal morphology (35van Leeuwen F.N. van Delft S. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In contrast to the signal-convergent system, we here demonstrated that constitutively active RhoA or Gα12QL-induced endogenous RhoA activation down-regulated the NGF-induced Rac1 activation via a Rho-associated kinase-dependent pathway. This down-regulation of Rac1 activity by RhoA can be categorized into the different regulatory mechanisms, upstream signal regulation, referred to as signal divergence (34Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Concerning this system, down-regulation of Rho activity by Rac has been reported in NIH3T3 cells (36Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). However, this is the first report of down-regulation of Rac1 activity by RhoA. Rho activation induces cell rounding, decreasing cell adhesion activity in PC12 cells (21Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Negishi M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Katoh H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Kitano Y. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28700-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, the RhoA-induced down-regulation of Rac1 activity is not a secondary effect of this RhoA-mediated reduction of cell adhesion activity, because the down-regulation was observed with suspended PC12 cells as well. Therefore, the site of action of RhoA is on a step(s), involved in the NGF-induced Rac1 activation signaling pathway. Ras is a critical component in the signaling pathway of the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (37Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 38Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S.

Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), and activation of Ras was shown to induce neurite outgrowth (20Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 40Noda M. Ko M. Ogura A. Liu D.G. Amano T. Takano T. Ikawa Y.

Recently, Rac1 was revealed to act downstream of Ras in neurite outgrowth independent of Ras-mediated ERK activation in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (42Sarner S. Kozma R. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NGF was shown to activate ERK in PC12 cells in the presence of RhoAV14 expression (16Sebok A. Nusser N. Debreceni B. Guo Z. Santos M.F. Szeberenyi J. Tigyi G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We also observed here that active RhoA did not perturb the NGF-induced ERK activation. Therefore, active RhoA may modulate the signaling pathway from Ras to Rac1 but not from Ras to ERK. The activity of Rac1 is known to be regulated by a variety of proteins, such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GTPase-activating proteins, and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (28Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). A Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos, was shown to be implicated in coupling Ras to Rac (43Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 44Scita G. Nordstrom J. Carbone R. Tenca P. Giardina G. Gutkind S. Bjarnegard M. Betsholtz C. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). RhoA may modulate the activities of these molecules, such as Sos. Molecular mechanisms of the RhoA-induced down-regulation of Rac1 activity are currently under investigation in our laboratory. We further investigated the effect of active RhoA on actin reorganization. We revealed here that NGF recruited Rac1 to the protrusion sites and accumulated F-actin, initiating the neurite formation. Active RhoA inhibited the NGF-induced Rac1 recruitment to the protrusion sites and resultant process formation through Rho-associated kinase. Our result showed that the cytoskeletal action of RhoA and its downstream effector, Rho-associated kinase, was the stabilization of cortical actin filaments in the cell periphery of PC12 cells. Since Rho-associated kinase is known to increase phosphorylation of myosin light chain, consequently elevating contractile activity of myosin, this myosin activation may enhance the stabilization of cortical actin filaments. In neuronal cells, disruption of the cortical actin filament network was shown to induce neurite formation, suggesting that contractile activity by cortical actin filaments inhibits the neuritogenesis and neurite extension (45Spero D.A. Roisen F.J. Brain Res. 1985; 355: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 46Bradke F. Dotti C.G. Science. 1999; 283: 1931-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rho-associated kinase-induced formation of the ringlike structure of cortical actin filaments in PC12 cells may interfere with the NGF-induced Rac1 recruitment and F-actin reorganization, which are initial events for the neurite formation. In this study, we showed that Y-27632, a Rho-associated kinase inhibitor, completely abolished the RhoA-induced down-regulation of the NGF-induced Rac1 activation, suggesting that the RhoA-induced down-regulation is mediated by Rho-associated kinase. The inhibition of Rac1 recruitment by Rho-associated kinase may contribute to the RhoA-induced down-regulation of the Rac1 activation. Studies using a dominant negative Rac1 show that Rac1 is involved in the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (17Chen X.Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Lamoureux P. Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Lin C. Wagner J.A. Heidemann S.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 635-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of Rac was shown to produce a loss of contractility associated with cell spreading and the formation of neurite-like extensions in N1E-115 cells (42Sarner S. Kozma R. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). On the other hand, active Rho suppresses the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (16Sebok A. Nusser N. Debreceni B. Guo Z. Santos M.F. Szeberenyi J. Tigyi G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rac and Rho exert antagonistic actions in neurite formation. We here demonstrated that NGF activated Rac1 but inversely suppressed the RhoA activity in PC12 cells. In the light of antagonistic actions of Rac1 and RhoA in neuronal morphology, the NGF-induced opposite regulation of Rac1 and RhoA activities may play an important role in the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. The expression of the active RhoA did not affect the basal level of Rac1 activity, and Y-27632 did not increase the basal Rac1 activity in PC12 cells. Effects of RhoA and Y-27632 appear to be restricted to the NGF-induced Rac1 activation. Although the regulation of this basal Rac1 activity is not understood, the activation of Rac1 by NGF and the basal activity may be regulated by different signaling mechanisms. Suppression of RhoA activity by NGF may enhance the duration of the NGF-induced Rac1 activation. Recently, NGF was shown to abolish Rho activation by binding to the neurotrophin receptor p75 (47Yamashita T. Tucker K.L. Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 585-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Considering the expression of p75 in PC12 cells (48Bilderback T.R. Gazula V.R. Lisanti M.P. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the NGF-induced down-regulation of RhoA may be mediated by p75. Furthermore, inactivation of Rho signaling pathway has been reported to promote axon regeneration in the central nervous system (8Lehmann M. Fournier A. Selles-Navarro I. Dergham P. Sebok A. Leclerc N. Tigyi G. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7537-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of the Rho/Rho-associated kinase pathway was suggested to act as a gate critical for the initiation of axonal outgrowth (49Bito H. Furuyashiki T. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Neuron. 2000; 26: 431-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, negative regulation of Rho activity is critical for neurite outgrowth. In sharp contrast to NGF, ephrin-A5 was shown to induce collapse of growth cone by opposite regulation of Rho and Rac, Rho activation and Rac down-regulation (50Wahl S. Barth H. Ciossek T. Aktories K. Mueller B.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Neuronal morphology appears to be critically balanced between Rho and Rac activities. In conclusion, we demonstrate here that NGF oppositely regulates Rac1 and RhoA activities, activation of Rac1 and suppression of RhoA, and that activation of RhoA blocks the NGF-induced neurite formation by the inhibition of Rac1 activity via Rho-associated kinase in PC12 cells. This work takes a close-up of an important role of Rho family GTPases in neurite formation and will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of neurite outgrowth.

MAG has a sialic acid binding site in its N-terminal domain and binds to specific sialylated glycans and gangliosides present on the surface of neurons, but the significance of these interactions in the effect of MAG on neurite outgrowth is unclear. Here we present evidence to suggest that recognition of sialylated glycans is essential for inhibition of neurite outgrowth by MAG. Arginine 118 on MAG is known to make a key contact with sialic acid. We show that mutation of this residue reduces the potency of MAG inhibitory activity but that residual activity is also a result of carbohydrate recognition. We then go on to investigate gangliosides GT1b and GD1a as candidate MAG receptors. We show that MAG specifically binds both gangliosides and that both are expressed on the surface of MAG-responsive neurons. Furthermore, antibody cross-linking of cell surface GT1b, but not GD1a, mimics the effect of MAG, in that neurite outgrowth is inhibited through activation of Rho kinase. These data strongly suggest that interaction with GT1b on the neuronal cell surface is a potential mechanism for inhibition of neurite outgrowth by MAG.

Gangliosides bind to MAG with the relative potencies GQ1bα > GT1aα, GD1α > GD1a, GT1b ≫ GM3, GM4, whereas GM1, GD1b, GD3, and GQ1b do not support adhesion (23Yang L.J.S. Zeller C.B. Shaper N.L.

Although the binding of MAG to sialylated glycans and gangliosides is well characterized, the functional importance of these interactions to the inhibition of neurite outgrowth by MAG is unclear. MAG binding to neurons is dependent on the presence of cell surface sialic acid (7Debellard M.E. Tang S. Mukhopadhyay G. Shen Y.J. Filbin M.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of exogenous sugars or neuraminidase treatment of neurons reduces the effect of MAG on neurite outgrowth (7Debellard M.E. Tang S. Mukhopadhyay G. Shen Y.J. Filbin M.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction between MAG and sialylated cell surface receptors results in inhibition of neurite outgrowth. However, mutation of arginine 118, an amino acid which is predicted to form hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate group of sialic acid (21May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), failed to inactivate the protein (29Tang S. Shen Y.J. Debellard M.E. Mukhopadhyay G. Salzer J.L. Crocker P.R. Filbin M.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1355-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion that a second, sialic acid-independent, site on MAG interacts with an unknown counter-receptor on neurons, triggering the intracellular signaling cascade leading to inhibition of neurite outgrowth (29Tang S. Shen Y.J. Debellard M.E. Mukhopadhyay G. Salzer J.L. Crocker P.R. Filbin M.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1355-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigate the roles of sialic acid and ganglioside recognition by MAG in the inhibition of neurite outgrowth. We show that, in the absence of arginine 118, the potency of MAG is significantly reduced, but the residual inhibitory activity also involves carbohydrate recognition. We then show that interaction of MAG with ganglioside GT1b is a potential mechanism for the inhibitory effect of MAG on neurite outgrowth. These results strongly suggest that GT1b represents a potential receptor for MAG, mediating inhibition of neurite outgrowth.

Briefly, a 96-well plate was coated with 10 μg/ml goat anti-human IgG overnight at 4 °C. After washing, Fc proteins were applied at varying concentrations and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Wells were washed and incubated with anti-MAG antibody at 10 μg/ml for 1 h. This was followed by visualization using anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase and O-phenylenediamine substrate. The hippocampi of gestational day 18 rat embryos were dissected out, incubated in trypsin (0.08%, 30 min at 37 °C), and dissociated mechanically (32Skaper S.D. Facci L. Milani D. Leon A. Toffano G. Conn P.M. Methods in Neuroscience. 2. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 17-33Google Scholar). Hippocampal cells were resuspended in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, anti-oxidants, 1 mm glutamine, 25 μmglutamate, and 1 mm pyruvate, and plated at a density of 3000 cells/well into 96-well dishes that had previously been coated with poly-d-lysine followed by 10% FCS. Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from postnatal day 8 Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pups. Cerebella were enzyme-digested, triturated, and plated into poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well in Eagle's basal medium supplemented to contain 25 mm KCl, 10% FCS, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (32Skaper S.D. Facci L. Milani D. Leon A. Toffano G. Conn P.M. Methods in Neuroscience. 2. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 17-33Google Scholar). One hour after plating primary neuronal cells, Fc proteins or anti-ganglioside antibodies at various concentrations were added in equal volumes of PBS to triplicate wells. All antibodies used in these assays were previously dialyzed against cell culture medium. For preincubation experiments, 10 μg/ml anti-MAG or control antibody or various concentrations of sugars were incubated with MAGR118A-Fc for 1 h at room temperature prior to addition to cells. For ganglioside preincubation experiments, gangliosides were reconstituted at 25 mg/ml in chloroform:methanol (1:1) and stored at −20 °C. Fresh stock solutions of 250 μg/ml ganglioside in 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in PBS in glass tubes were prepared by vigorous vortexing immediately before each experiment. Gangliosides were diluted to 2 μg/ml into Fc protein solution in sterile glass tubes and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before being added to cultures as above. After 24 h (cerebellar granule neurons) or 48 h (hippocampal cells), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h on ice, washed with PBS, and stained using Coomassie Blue (11Huang D.W. McKerracher L. Braun P.E. David S. Neuron. 1999; 24: 639-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 (in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid) were added per well and incubated for 30 s. Stain was tipped off and the wells were washed three times with PBS. Assays were quantified using a KS300 image analysis system (Imaging Associates, UK). For each cell measured, the length from the edge of the cell to the end of the longest neurite was measured for 100 cells/well for each treatment in triplicate. Results are expressed as a percentage of the length of neurites of cells treated with control-treated with PBS alone. The length of neurites from control-treated neurons varied between experiments (between 35 and 50 μm for hippocampal neurons after 48 h of culture and 20–40 μm for cerebellar neurons cultured for 24 h). Therefore control-treated cells were included on every 96-well plate and results for each treatment in an experiment were expressed as a percentage of the length of control-treated cells. This allowed data from three independent experiments to be pooled. Data points therefore represent mean and S.E. of data pooled from three independent experiments. Primary neuronal cells were plated onto 8-well chamber slides coated as described above. After 24 h (cerebellar granule neurons) or 48 h (hippocampal neurons), cells were fixed as above and stained by standard immunocytochemistry techniques. 10 μg/ml primary antibody (or isotype control) or biotinylated cholera toxin in PBS/10% FCS was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Secondary reagents were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h as follows: for biotinylated anti-GT1b and cholera toxin, 1:200 dilution of streptavidin-Texas Red; for anti-GD1a and A2B5, 1:30 dilution of anti-mouse-TRITC. To assess their structural integrity, MAG-Fc and MAGR118A-Fc recombinant proteins were tested in an ELISA assay using the anti-MAG monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a conformation-dependent epitope. MAG-Fc and MAGR118A-Fc reacted identically in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 a) indicating that both proteins were correctly folded. To investigate the role of arginine 118 in inhibition of neurite growth by MAG, neurite outgrowth experiments were carried out in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Consistent with previous reports, MAG-Fc potently inhibited neuronal outgrowth (Fig. 1 b). SIRP-Fc (consisting of the three extracellular N-terminal Ig-like domains of rat SIRP (33Fujikowa Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasguga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) fused to the Fc region of human IgG1) had no effect on neurite outgrowth from hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1 b), consistent with previous observations using cerebellar granule neurons (34Prinjha R. Moore S.E. Vinson M. Blake S. Morrow R. Christie G. Michalovich D. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Nature. 2000; 403: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), therefore showing that inhibition of outgrowth by MAG-Fc was specific for MAG and not a result of the presence of the Fc region. MAGR118A-Fc also inhibited neurite outgrowth but with lower potency compared with the unmutated form (Fig. 1 b). This inhibition was specific when compared with negative control Fc protein SIRP-Fc, and was reversed with the anti-MAG antibody mAb 513 but not mouse IgG1 isotype control. A similar effect was seen for neurite outgrowth from cerebellar granule neurons (data not shown). To investigate the basis for the residual activity of MAGR118A-Fc, we carried out neurite outgrowth assays using MAGR118A-Fc in the presence of mono- and trisaccharides. The sugars tested did not affect neurite length when added to concentrations up to 5 mm in the absence of MAGR118A-Fc (data not shown). Inhibition of neurite outgrowth by MAGR118A-Fc was blocked by preincubation with α-methyl sialic acid (Neu5Ac) and the sialylated trisaccharide 3′-sialyllactose (Neu5Acα2–3Galβ1–4Glc) (Fig.2); however, incubation with 0.1 mm 6′-sialyllactose did not significantly reverse inhibition (data not shown). This suggests that MAGR118A-Fc inhibits neurite outgrowth via recognition of sialylated glycans on the surface of neurons. Specific gangliosides are known to bind MAG via their carbohydrate epitopes with relative potencies GQ1bα > GT1aα, GD1α > GT1b, GD1a ≫ GM1. The recent availability of anti-ganglioside antibodies (35Kotani M. Ozawa H. Kawashima I. Ando S. Tai T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 36Ozawa H. Kotani M. Kawashima I. Tai T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has provided the opportunity to investigate the functional significance of these interactions. Although MAG binds to the α-series gangliosides with higher affinity, their expression in brain is very low (0.5, 0.9, and 0.3 mg/kg for GQ1bα, GT1aα, and GD1α, respectively) compared with that of GD1a and GT1b (abundance of GD1a is 1200 mg/kg), which are among two of the four major brain gangliosides (27Collins B.E. Ito H. Sawada N. Ishida H. Kiso M. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37637-37643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). If gangliosides are involved in neurite outgrowth inhibition in response to MAG, GD1a and GT1b would be predicted to be involved, because MAG affects all neuronal types tested. To examine whether GD1a and GT1b could compete with endogenous neuronal MAG receptors for MAG binding, we preincubated Fc protein with gangliosides prior to addition into neurite outgrowth assays (37Probstmeier R. Pesheva P. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Preincubation of MAG-Fc with a mixture of brain gangliosides, purified GT1b or GD1a but not asialo GM1 or GM1, blocked the inhibitory action of MAG (Fig. 3 a). The inhibitory activity of MAGR118A-Fc was also partially reversed by GT1b or GD1a preincubation (Fig. 3 b). Immunocytochemistry using anti-ganglioside antibodies confirmed the expression of GT1b and GD1a on the surface of surface of primary cerebellar and hippocampal neurons (Fig.4). Both these antibodies showed most intense staining associated with cell bodies. Weaker staining was observed on some neurites. Ganglioside GM1 and the A2B5 antigen (an uncharacterized epitope carried by several gangliosides) were also found to be expressed on the surface of these cells (Fig. 4). A lack of fluorescence for cells stained with secondary antibody alone confirmed specificity (data not shown). The effect of anti-ganglioside antibodies on neurite outgrowth was then assessed. If MAG inhibits neurite outgrowth by binding to either GD1a or GT1b on the surface of neurons, antibodies recognizing these gangliosides may be expected to mimic the effect of MAG on neurite outgrowth. Anti-GT1b antibody, but not isotype control or antibodies recognizing GD1a, GM1, or the A2B5 antigen inhibited neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5, a and b). The specificity of this effect was demonstrated by preincubation of anti-GT1b antibody with purified gangliosides. Preincubation with GT1b but not with other gangliosides blocked the inhibition of neurite outgrowth by the anti-GT1b antibody (Fig. 5 c). Rho GTPase has been shown to be a key signaling step for the inhibitory effect of myelin on regeneration of neurons in vivo (9Lehmann M. Fournier A. Selles-Navarro I. Dergham P. Sebok A. Leclerc N. Tigyi G. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7537-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition by MAG has been shown to be blocked by C3 exoenzyme, a specific inhibitor of Rho (9Lehmann M. Fournier A. Selles-Navarro I. Dergham P. Sebok A. Leclerc N. Tigyi G. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7537-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of Y27632, a specific inhibitor of Rho kinase, a downstream effector of Rho, on inhibition of neurite outgrowth by MAG and anti-GT1b antibody. Y27632 blocked inhibition of neurite outgrowth by both MAG and anti-GT1b antibody from cerebellar and hippocampal neurons (Fig.6). The blockade of the inhibitory activity of MAGR118A-Fc with sialic acid, 3′-sialyllactose, and specific gangliosides shown in this study suggests that this mutated form of MAG retains the ability to bind carbohydrate ligands and that these sugars and gangliosides, when added exogenously, can compete with endogenous neuronal receptors. Although these findings do not rule out interactions between MAG and other neuronal cell surface molecules, they strongly suggest that MAG inhibits neuronal outgrowth by recognition of sialylated glycans on the neuronal cell surface. From the crystal structure of siglec 1 (sialoadhesin) complexed with 3′-sialyllactose, it is evident that amino acids other than arginine 118 are involved in binding sialic acid (21May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These are conserved in MAG and include tryptophan 2, a key amino acid for sialic acid recognition (21May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Furthermore, components of the core glycan on which sialic acid is presented are able to increase the binding affinity of MAG for sialic acid either through direct contacts or more favorable presentations of sialic acid, increasing the affinity of MAG for sialic acid itself (23Yang L.J.S. Zeller C.B. Shaper N.L. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Shapiro R.E. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 26Strenge K. Schauer R. Bovin N. Hasegawa A. Ishida H. Kiso M. Kelm S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The reduced potency of inhibition of MAGR118A-Fc compared with the unmutated protein is therefore consistent with a reduced affinity of binding due to the loss of arginine 118. Inhibitors of neurite outgrowth in myelin may prevent aberrant sprouting under steady-state conditions (38Buffo A. Zagrebelsky M. Huber A.B. Skerra A. Schwab M.E. Strata P. Rossi F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2275-2286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of these molecules may require regulation to prevent unwanted neuronal retraction. Linking carbohydrate recognition by MAG to biological function raises the possibility that the effect of MAG on neurons during steady-state or disease conditions could be regulated by changes in lectin activity. Two mechanisms of regulation of lectin activity for other siglecs have been identified. First, “cis ” interactions between siglecs (including MAG) and sialylated glycans on the same cell surface (and perhaps on siglecs themselves) have been shown to block binding to opposing cells (13Freeman S.D. Kelm S. Barber E.K. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1995; 85: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Augustus M. Carter K.C. Crocker P.R.

In the case of siglec 2 (CD22), blocking of lectin activity by cisinteractions on resting B-lymphocytes can be “unmasked” on pharmacological or physiological activation, demonstrating the potential for this type of regulation in physiological processes (39Razi N. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7469-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Second, the ability of siglecs to bind sialic acid may be regulated intracellularly. In the case of siglecs containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs in their cytoplasmic domains (siglecs 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7), inside-out regulation of the ability to bind sialylated glycans occurs through the recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 (41Taylor V.C.

Regulation of sialic acid binding therefore appears to be an important aspect of siglec biology and may rep"

One step toward understanding this problem is to test whether other substrates of P-gp react with the same residues in the predicted drug-binding domain. Verapamil is a particularly important substrate used in studying P-gp. The advantage of using verapamil is that it shows the greatest ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of P-gp. Development of a thiol-reactive derivative of verapamil would be a useful tool for characterizing the drug-binding domain of P-gp, because reactive cysteines can be specifically protected with verapamil. In this study, a thiol-reactive methanethiosulfonate analog of verapamil (MTS-verapamil) was synthesized and used to identify residues in the drug-binding domain of P-gp.DISCUSSIONCysteine-scanning mutagenesis and modification with sulfhydryl-specific agents was first used to probe the acetylcholine receptor channel (44Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Modifications of this method have since been used to study the structure and function of many membrane proteins (reviewed in Ref. 45Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This technique has been extensively used in the study of the bacterial lac permease protein (46Sahin-Toth M. Karlin A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). P-gp has been a very good eukaryotic protein for cysteine-scanning mutagenesis studies, because the Cys-less P-gp remains functional (reviewed in Ref.47Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Experiments that provide insight into the structure and mechanism of P-gp are possible because of the ability to synthesize thiol-reactive analogs of P-gp substrates such as MTS-verapamil.Fifteen of the 242 Cys mutants tested for inhibition by MTS-verapamil showed significant inhibition by MTS-verapamil. In general, the reactive mutants in TMs 4, 6, 10, 11, and 12 had lower I50values than those in TMs 2, 7, and 9 (TableI). This may indicate that TMs 4, 6, 10, 11, and 12 are within the drug-binding domain or that this region of P-gp is more accessible to MTS-verapamil. Verapamil significantly protected residues S222C (TM4), L339 (TM6), A342 (TM6), and G984 (TM12) from inactivation by MTS-verapamil. This indicates that these residues either line or are close to the verapamil-binding site. To picture the potential drug-binding domain of P-gp, we constructed a model in which the residues in each TM segments are arranged in α-helical wheels (Fig. 5). The arrangement of the TM segments are based on the results of disulfide cross-linking studies that show TM 6 is close to TMs 10, 11, and 12 and that TM12 is close to TMs 4, 5, and 6 (48Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 49Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In another ABC transporter, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, it has been shown that a salt bridge may exist between TM6 and TM8 (50Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5429-5435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). TMs 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 have been postulated to line the drug-binding domain, because cross-linking between residues in these segments is affected by the presence of drug substrates. The location of the drug-binding domain within the TMs would be consistent with the idea that P-gp removes substrates that are embedded in the lipid bilayer (51Raviv Y. Pollard H.B. Bruggemann E.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3975-3980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Homolya L. Hollo Z. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

It is thought that substrates diffuse into the lipid bilayer and are then extracted from the bilayer leaflets by P-gp.Table IComparing inhibition of Cys P-gp mutants by dBBn or MTS-verapamilMutantInhibitorProtection by verapamildBBnMTS-verapamil (I50)dBBnMTS-verapamilμmY118C (TM2)+ 1-aInhibition.+ (40)− 1-bNo protection.−V125C (TM2)++ (63)−−S222C (TM4)++ (40)++ 1-cHighly protected from inhibition.++L339C (TM6)++ (29)++++A342C (TM6)+/−+ (14)ND 1-dND, not determined due to little or no inhibition.++A729C (TM7)1-eNo inhibition.−/+ (70)ND−S766C (TM8)+−−NDA841C (TM9)−+ (101)ND−N842C (TM9)−+ (61)ND−I868C (TM10)++ (25)+ 1-fProtection from inhibition.+A871C (TM10)−+ (14)ND−G872C (TM10)+−+NDF942C (TM11)++ (20)++T945C (TM11)++ (8)++L975C (TM12)+−+NDV982C (TM12)++ (12)−−G984C (TM12)ND+ (17)ND++A985C (TM12)++ (38)+−1-g ND, not done because of low expression.1-a Inhibition.1-b No protection.1-c Highly protected from inhibition.1-d ND, not determined due to little or no inhibition.1-e No inhibition.1-f Protection from inhibition. Open table in a new tab Studies with another thiol-reactive substrate, dBBn, also indicate that TMs 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 are close to the drug-binding domain (30Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A comparison of the inhibition by dBBn and MTS-verapamil is shown in Table I. There is some overlap in the cysteine residues that can react with either dibromobimane or MTS-verapamil. For example, S222C (TM4) and L339C (TM6) are inhibited by dBBn and MTS-verapamil. Both residues were protected from inhibition by the presence of verapamil. In contrast, residues Y118C (TM2), V125C (TM2), and V982C (TM12) were inhibited by dBBn and MTS-verapamil but were less protected from inhibition by verapamil. The difference in inhibition by dBBn and MTS-verapamil may be explained if we assume that there is a single drug-binding domain in P-gp that is flexible enough to accommodate structurally diverse substrates. This “substrate-induced fit” model of substrate binding to P-gp is consistent with that proposed for the soluble BmrR transcription factor that can also bind a wide variety of compounds. The crystal structure of BmrR indicates the presence of a single drug-binding pocket (53Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Indeed, disulfide-cross-linking studies have shown that regions in P-gp are quite mobile (49Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 54Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19435-19438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In some instances, cross-linking between residues in the TMs or between residues in the nucleotide-binding domains occurs at 37 °C and not at lower temperatures. The relative mobility of the TM segments could allow P-gp to bind compounds of diverse structures. A substrate could induce a conformational change in the TM segments such that different residues in the TMs would contribute to its binding. In this scenario, it is possible that different substrates could have overlapping residues contributing to its binding. This may be the case with the binding of dBBn and MTS-verapamil. Having many combinations of residues in the drug-binding domain that can contribute to binding of different substrates may explain why P-gp can bind such a wide range of structurally diverse compounds. It may also explain why P-gp has a different affinity for each substrate and may account for the reports of multiple drug-binding sites (31Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 32Shapiro A.B. Fox K. Lam P. Ling V. Eur. J.

Charlton P. Callaghan R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 may also explain how mutations throughout the TM segments can directly or indirectly affect the affinity of P-gp for a particular substrate (23Gros P. Dhir R. Croop J. Talbot F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7289-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Loo T.W.

Mutations to residues in the TMs may change the faces of the helices that are exposed toward the drug-binding site such that different residues are available for drug binding, thereby changing the affinity of P-gp for a particular substrate.MTS-verapamil should be a useful compound for future studies on the mechanism of P-gp. Many P-gp substrates and modulators can be used to test if they will prevent modification of P-gp by MTS-verapamil, and the results will reveal if there is overlap in the binding sites. It will also be interesting to test whether membrane fluidity or lipid composition affects modification of P-gp by MTS-verapamil. P-gp activity is highly sensitive to its lipid environment (59Doige C.A., Yu, X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 60Urbatsch I.L.

Verapamil and other phenylalkylamines are inhibitors of thel-type calcium channels (61Hargreaves A.C. Gunthorpe M.J. Taylor C.W. Lummis S.C. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Blocking of the ion channels by verapamil is thought to occur by occlusion of the ion-conducting pore. Therefore, MTS-verapamil may be useful for mapping the pore region of these channel proteins. The human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp)1 uses ATP to pump a wide variety of cytotoxic compounds out of the cell (1Sharom F.J. J. Membr.

One step toward understanding this problem is to test whether other substrates of P-gp react with the same residues in the predicted drug-binding domain. Verapamil is a particularly important substrate used in studying P-gp. The advantage of using verapamil is that it shows the greatest ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of P-gp. Development of a thiol-reactive derivative of verapamil would be a useful tool for characterizing the drug-binding domain of P-gp, because reactive cysteines can be specifically protected with verapamil. In this study, a thiol-reactive methanethiosulfonate analog of verapamil (MTS-verapamil) was synthesized and used to identify residues in the drug-binding domain of P-gp. DISCUSSIONCysteine-scanning mutagenesis and modification with sulfhydryl-specific agents was first used to probe the acetylcholine receptor channel (44Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Modifications of this method have since been used to study the structure and function of many membrane proteins (reviewed in Ref. 45Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This technique has been extensively used in the study of the bacterial lac permease protein (46Sahin-Toth M. Karlin A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). P-gp has been a very good eukaryotic protein for cysteine-scanning mutagenesis studies, because the Cys-less P-gp remains functional (reviewed in Ref.47Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Experiments that provide insight into the structure and mechanism of P-gp are possible because of the ability to synthesize thiol-reactive analogs of P-gp substrates such as MTS-verapamil.Fifteen of the 242 Cys mutants tested for inhibition by MTS-verapamil showed significant inhibition by MTS-verapamil. In general, the reactive mutants in TMs 4, 6, 10, 11, and 12 had lower I50values than those in TMs 2, 7, and 9 (TableI). This may indicate that TMs 4, 6, 10, 11, and 12 are within the drug-binding domain or that this region of P-gp is more accessible to MTS-verapamil. Verapamil significantly protected residues S222C (TM4), L339 (TM6), A342 (TM6), and G984 (TM12) from inactivation by MTS-verapamil. This indicates that these residues either line or are close to the verapamil-binding site. To picture the potential drug-binding domain of P-gp, we constructed a model in which the residues in each TM segments are arranged in α-helical wheels (Fig. 5). The arrangement of the TM segments are based on the results of disulfide cross-linking studies that show TM 6 is close to TMs 10, 11, and 12 and that TM12 is close to TMs 4, 5, and 6 (48Loo T.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In another ABC transporter, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, it has been shown that a salt bridge may exist between TM6 and TM8 (50Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5429-5435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). TMs 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 have been postulated to line the drug-binding domain, because cross-linking between residues in these segments is affected by the presence of drug substrates. The location of the drug-binding domain within the TMs would be consistent with the idea that P-gp removes substrates that are embedded in the lipid bilayer (51Raviv Y. Pollard H.B. Bruggemann E.P.

Open table in a new tab Studies with another thiol-reactive substrate, dBBn, also indicate that TMs 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 are close to the drug-binding domain (30Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A comparison of the inhibition by dBBn and MTS-verapamil is shown in Table I. There is some overlap in the cysteine residues that can react with either dibromobimane or MTS-verapamil. For example, S222C (TM4) and L339C (TM6) are inhibited by dBBn and MTS-verapamil. Both residues were protected from inhibition by the presence of verapamil. In contrast, residues Y118C (TM2), V125C (TM2), and V982C (TM12) were inhibited by dBBn and MTS-verapamil but were less protected from inhibition by verapamil. The difference in inhibition by dBBn and MTS-verapamil may be explained if we assume that there is a single drug-binding domain in P-gp that is flexible enough to accommodate structurally diverse substrates. This “substrate-induced fit” model of substrate binding to P-gp is consistent with that proposed for the soluble BmrR transcription factor that can also bind a wide variety of compounds. The crystal structure of BmrR indicates the presence of a single drug-binding pocket (53Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Indeed, disulfide-cross-linking studies have shown that regions in P-gp are quite mobile (49Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 54Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19435-19438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In some instances, cross-linking between residues in the TMs or between residues in the nucleotide-binding domains occurs at 37 °C and not at lower temperatures. The relative mobility of the TM segments could allow P-gp to bind compounds of diverse structures. A substrate could induce a conformational change in the TM segments such that different residues in the TMs would contribute to its binding. In this scenario, it is possible that different substrates could have overlapping residues contributing to its binding. This may be the case with the binding of dBBn and MTS-verapamil. Having many combinations of residues in the drug-binding domain that can contribute to binding of different substrates may explain why P-gp can bind such a wide range of structurally diverse compounds. It may also explain why P-gp has a different affinity for each substrate and may account for the reports of multiple drug-binding sites (31Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 32Shapiro A.B. Fox K. Lam P. Ling V. Eur. J.

Fig. 5 may also explain how mutations throughout the TM segments can directly or indirectly affect the affinity of P-gp for a particular substrate (23Gros P. Dhir R. Croop J. Talbot F. Proc. Natl.

Mutations to residues in the TMs may change the faces of the helices that are exposed toward the drug-binding site such that different residues are available for drug binding, thereby changing the affinity of P-gp for a particular substrate.MTS-verapamil should be a useful compound for future studies on the mechanism of P-gp. Many P-gp substrates and modulators can be used to test if they will prevent modification of P-gp by MTS-verapamil, and the results will reveal if there is overlap in the binding sites. It will also be interesting to test whether membrane fluidity or lipid composition affects modification of P-gp by MTS-verapamil. P-gp activity is highly sensitive to its lipid environment (59Doige C.A., Yu, X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 60Urbatsch I.L.

It is composed of structural proteins, including involucrin, loricrin, and the small proline-rich (SPRR) proteins, all encoded by genes localized at human chromosome 1q21. The genetic characterization of the SPRR locus reveals that the various members of this multigene family can be classified into two distinct groups with separate evolutionary histories. Whereas group 1 genes have diverged in protein structure and are composed of three different classes (SPRR1 (2×), SPRR3, and SPRR4), an active process of gene conversion has counteracted diversification of the protein sequences of group 2 genes (SPRR2 class, seven genes). Contrasting with this homogenization process, all individual members of the SPRR gene family show specific in vivo and in vitro expression patterns and react selectively to UV irradiation. Apparently, creation of regulatory rather than structural diversity has been the driving force behind the evolution of the SPRR gene family. Differential regulation of highly homologous genes underlines the importance of SPRR protein dosage in providing optimal barrier function to different epithelia, while allowing adaptation to diverse external insults.

Whereas group 1 genes have diverged in protein structure and are composed of three different classes (SPRR1 (2×), SPRR3, and SPRR4), an active process of gene conversion has counteracted diversification of the protein sequences of group 2 genes (SPRR2 class, seven genes). Contrasting with this homogenization process, all individual members of the SPRR gene family show specific in vivo and in vitro expression patterns and react selectively to UV irradiation. Apparently, creation of regulatory rather than structural diversity has been the driving force behind the evolution of the SPRR gene family. Differential regulation of highly homologous genes underlines the importance of SPRR protein dosage in providing optimal barrier function to different epithelia, while allowing adaptation to diverse external insults. cornified envelope small proline-rich protein reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction long distance An essential function of stratified squamous epithelia is to provide a protective barrier for the organism against extracellular and environmental factors. The cornified cell envelope (CE),1 a specialized structure formed beneath the plasma membrane of differentiated cells, is a major component responsible for this protective function (1Matoltsy A.G.

The CE is an insoluble ∼15-nm-thick layer, which is the result of extensive cross-linking of several proteins by both disulfide and Nε(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds catalyzed mainly by transglutaminases 1 and 3 (4Martinet N.

Lichti U. Kuroki T. Steinert P.M. Kartasova T. Genomics. 1999; 55: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The SPRR proteins have an identical structure consisting of head (amino-) and tail (carboxyl-terminal) domains, comprising several glutamine and lysine residues, and a proline-rich central repetitive domain. Whereas the head and tail domains show a high degree of homology with other CE precursors (e.g. involucrin and loricrin; Ref. 24Backendorf C. Hohl D. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 91Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the internal repeats, which vary in both number and consensus sequence, distinguish the various members of this gene family, allowing their classification into several SPRR classes. Based on the specific sequences of these internal domains, secondary structure algorithms have predicted various degrees of flexibility for different classes (SPRR2 < SPRR1 < SPRR3) (25Kartasova T.

Among all cornified envelope precursor proteins identified to date, SPRRs are the only ones that are encoded by a multigene family. Important questions concerning the reason for this complexity remain to be addressed. To provide novel insights to these questions, we have characterized the whole human SPRR locus, including the identification of several new members, the refinement of the physical and transcriptional maps, the comparison of gene and deduced protein structures, and the establishment of in vivo and in vitro expression patterns at the single gene level and after UV irradiation. The chromosome 1 cosmid library ICRFc112 (38Nizetic D. Monard S. Young B. Cotter F. Zehetner G. Lehrach H. Mamm Genome. 1994; 5: 801-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was screened with SPRR class specific probes (16Gibbs S. Fijneman R. Wiegant J. van Kessel A.G. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Genomics. 1993; 16: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A total of 27 cosmids covering the SPRR locus were identified and used for preliminary contig assembly (21South A.P. Cabral A.

A minimal tiling path comprising seven cosmids was chosen for further analysis, and overlap was verified by cosmid walking (39Ivens A. Little P. Glover D. Hames B. DNA Cloning 3 A Practical Approach.

Cosmids, linearized with NruI or CpoI (both are unique restriction sites in the vector), were partially digested with eitherBamHI, BglII, EcoRI,HindIII, KpnI, NcoI, PstI, or XbaI and analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis as previously described (21South A.P.

SPRR1A, SPRR1B, andSPRR3 genes have been described (40Sark M.W. Fischer D.F. de Meijer E. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1999; 55: 88-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A probe forSPRR4 was derived from an expressed sequence tag (EST) library and obtained by RT-PCR of epidermal RNA. Superposition of the sequencing data with the contiguous restriction map provided the physical map of the SPRR locus, with the exact position and the transcriptional orientation of the different genes. Gene orientation and intergenic distances were verified by long-distance (LD) PCR (Fig.1). Normal human keratinocytes were cultured as previously described (43Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and induced to terminally differentiate by using the stratification assay (43Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Shortly, monolayers of basal cells (−Ca2+ conditions) were induced to stratify for 48 h by adding Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% serum, without growth factors (+Ca2+ conditions). UV-C irradiation (30 J/m2) was applied to the monolayers before the addition of +Ca2+ medium. RNA was isolated according to Ref. 44Belt P.B. Groeneveld H. Teubel W.J. van de Putte P. Backendorf C.

Frozen tissues obtained from the Department of Pathology (Leiden University Medical Center) were homogenized, and total RNA was isolated by the Trizol method (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA from skin, esophagus, and uterus were also purchased from Invitrogen. Total RNA (0.4 μg) was reverse transcribed using Super RT (SphaeroQ) and random hexamer primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCR was performed for 25, 30, and 35 cycles with 20 pmol of gene-specific primers and 0.4 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The specificity of the various primer mixes was determined by using the various cosmids or derived plasmids containing a single SPRR gene and verified by sequencing (data not shown). The absence of DNA contamination in RNA preparations could be easily controlled as several primer combinations bridged an intron.

The cluster, previously localized to a 170-kilobase region on human chromosome 1q21 (16Gibbs S. Fijneman R. Wiegant J. van Kessel A.G. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Genomics. 1993; 16: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21South A.P. Cabral A. Ives J.H. James C.H. Mirza G. Marenholz I. Mischke D. Backendorf C. Ragoussis J. Nizetic D. J. Invest.

Pavel, and C. Backendorf, manuscript in preparation. Long distance PCR (LD-PCR) was performed to confirm the relative position and orientation of the various genes (stippled lines). The transcriptional orientation of the various members (indicated by arrows) is not random and allows the splitting of the SPRR cluster into two groups. One group consists of SPRR1A, SPRR1B,SPRR3, and SPRR4, which are placed in a proximal region and are transcriptionally oriented from centromere to telomere. The other group comprises the seven SPRR2 genes, clustered in a 100-kilobase region, all oriented in the same direction but opposite to group 1 genes. The subdivision of SPRR genes into two groups is also justified by the comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences (Fig.2 A). Group 1 genes (SPRR1A, SPRR1B, SPRR3, andSPRR4) are characterized by a long amino terminus, an 8-amino acid repeat motif and a short carboxyl terminus, whereas group 2 genes (all SPRR2) have a short amino terminus, a 9-amino acid repeat motif, and a more extended carboxyl terminus. In the central repeats of the various proteins, more diversity exists among group 1 proteins, which show differences in both number of repeats and consensus sequence of the repetitive unit. These differences justify the classification of the four group 1 genes into three classes (SPRR1, SPRR3, and SPRR4). On the contrary, the seven group 2 proteins are characterized by a much higher homogeneity, as each member contains three repeats of the same nonamer consensus. Hence, all group 2 genes belong to a single class, SPRR2. In Fig. 2 B the central repetitive domains of SPRR2 genes have been aligned. Although repeats 1, 2, and 3 of a single gene have different consensi at the nucleotide level (mainly because of variations in the wobble position), each of the three repeats is highly conserved among the various members. This indicates that during evolution, repeat duplication has preceded gene duplication and was maintained hereafter in each gene. The seven group 2 proteins (Fig.2 C) are highly homologous. For instance, 2Bdiffers from 2A by 1 amino acid and from 2D and2E by 2 residues. Notably, all amino acids previously identified as being involved in transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking during CE formation (11Candi E. Melino G. Sette M. Oddi S. Guerrieri P. Paci M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 14Steinert P.M. Kartasova T. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11758-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) are conserved in all SPRR2 proteins (red residues). Fig. 3 provides a global view of the sequence conservation among group 2 genes (black plot). The highest similarity is found in exon 2 (94%) and corresponds to the amino terminus of the protein (from position 1250 to 1400). Nevertheless, high sequence conservation is not restricted to the coding sequence, because in SPRR2B and 2E(red plot) a 550-base pair region, with 100% identity, extends from the intron to the coding sequence (positions 850–1400). The various promoters revealed an average homology of ∼70%. The major differences are between positions 200 and 300 bases and are due to a deletion in SPRR2B. The lower sequence conservation within the promoters of both group 1 (42Fischer D.F. Sark M.W. Lehtola M.M. Gibbs S. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Genomics. 1999; 55: 88-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and group 2 prompted us to monitor the specific expression pattern for each gene. Initially, we analyzed RNA from various human tissues by hybridization with class specific probes (results not shown). Besides the expected expression in various stratified squamous epithelia (27Hohl D. de Viragh P.A. Amiguet-Barras F. Gibbs S. Backendorf C. Huber M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,35Xu X.C. Mitchell M.F. Silva E. Jetten A. Lotan R. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1503-1508PubMed Google Scholar), some SPRRs were also detected in tissues that (normally) do not contain these epithelia (uterus, bladder, ovary, and trachea). Uterus, ovary, and 3 stratified squamous epithelia, namely skin, esophagus, and cervix, were chosen for single gene analysis. Likewise, expression in a well established in vitro system, which permits the study of keratinocyte terminal differentiation (45Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Nature. 1977; 265: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), was also analyzed. Because of the high homology within the SPRR family, gene specific semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out to characterize the relative expression patterns for individual genes (Fig.4). The analysis of calcium-mediatedin vitro keratinocyte differentiation (−Ca2+and +Ca2+) revealed that all SPRRs are induced during this process, except for SPRR2F. In stratified squamous epithelia distinctions in gene expression between the different tissues were observed. Only SPRR2G and SPRR4 are preferentially expressed in skin. All other SPRRs show higher expression levels in mucosal-stratified squamous epithelia, but with tissue-specific modulation (e.g. compare the relative expression of SPRR2B, 2C, and 2D in esophagus and cervix). SPRR1A and 3 are present in ovary, SPRR2D is found in uterus, and 2B,2E, and 2F in both uterus and ovary. Especially, the high expression of SPRR2F in ovary is remarkable. To analyze the response of the SPRR gene family to external damaging insults, we have treated human keratinocyte cultures with UV light and measured the expression of individual SPRRs (Fig.5). In two independent experiments, various members reacted selectively to this DNA-damaging agent. WhereasSPRR4, 2C, and 2G are consistently induced, a certain degree of variability is observed between individual experiments in the case of 2B, 2D, and2F. SPRR1A, 1B, 3,2A, and 2E do not respond to UV irradiation. The variability in SPRR2B, 2D, and 2Finduction is likely because of small differences in cell density, which are difficult to control at the start of the experiment, but might affect gene expression (46Lee Y.S. Yuspa S.H. Dlugosz A.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 762-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). UV irradiation did not affect the expression of involucrin. Overall these results indicate that individual SPRR genes are differentially expressed, although only a limited amount of biological samples (five different human tissues andin vitro-cultured keratinocytes) were analyzed, and the effect of a single external agent (UV) was studied. The cornified envelope (CE) has a vital role in the barrier function of stratified squamous epithelia. Recent biochemical studies suggest that SPRR proteins are the major modulators of the biomechanical properties of cornified envelopes (12Candi E. Tarcsa E. Idler W.W. Kartasova T. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7226-7237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Steinert P.M. Candi E. Kartasova T. Marekov L. J. Struct.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23297-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Among all CE precursor proteins identified to date, SPRRs are the only ones that are encoded by a gene family. Although all genes have a common ancestor (16Gibbs S. Fijneman R. Wiegant J. van Kessel A.G. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Genomics. 1993; 16: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the present analysis indicates that the family can be divided into two distinct subgroups with separate evolutionary histories. Whereas group 1 genes have clearly diverged in protein structure, group 2 genes are characterized by a highly conserved coding sequence. Darwinian selection (recently reviewed in Ref. 47Li W.-H. Molecular Evolution. Sinauer Associates, Inc., 1997Google Scholar) is not likely to be the driving force behind this conservation, as most wobble positions, including those which are specific for each of the three repeats (Fig. 2 B), have been strongly preserved among all group 2 genes. The nature of the process responsible for this high similarity is revealed by comparing SPRR2B andSPRR2E (Fig. 3). An identical 550-base pair long region, flanked by non-identical DNA, points to gene conversion as the implicated mechanism. Gene conversion is a process of homologous recombination, which can be defined as a non-reciprocal transfer of information between two sequences. As one sequence can be converted into the other one this process can result in the homogenization of gene families (reviewed in Ref. 47Li W.-H. Molecular Evolution. Sinauer Associates, Inc., 1997Google Scholar). Whereas the chromosomal organization and the protein structures of SPRRs clearly distinguish group 1 and group 2 genes, such subdivision is not evident when examining the expression patterns of individual genes. In fact, the major finding of this work is that all human SPRR genes, irrespective of the group or class they belong to, are under the control of specific and selective regulatory processes. Apparently, during the evolution of the SPRR gene family, creation of regulatory diversity was more important than diversification in protein structure. This implies that the control of protein dosage must be of major importance for the function of these genes. Our RT-PCR analysis corroborates and extends earlier studies using class-specific DNA/RNA probes, antibodies, or CE peptide sequencing, which have not allowed the detection of gene-specific differences within one class. The high expression of SPRR3 in esophagus and its absence from epidermis (27Hohl D. de Viragh P.A. Amiguet-Barras F. Gibbs S. Backendorf C. Huber M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 902-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), as well as the elevated expression of SPRR1 in internal epithelia (48Lee C.H. Marekov L.N. Kim S. Brahim J.S. Park M.H. Steinert P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have previously been observed. An interesting novel observation is the preferential expression of SPRR2G and SPRR4 in skin. Generally, it appears that genes that are well expressed in external “dry”; epithelia (skin) are lower in internal “wet”; epithelia and vice versa. Especially the preferential expression ofSPRR2F in ovary is noteworthy. Expression of specific SPRR2 genes in murine uterus (23Song H.J. Poy G. Darwiche N. Lichti U. Kuroki T. Steinert P.M. Kartasova T. Genomics. 1999; 55: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the presence of an SPRR homolog in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (49Tesfaigzi J. Carlson D.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have previously been reported. At present, there is no satisfactory explanation for SPRR expression in these organs, which do not contain stratified squamous epithelia. It has been suggested that the presence of SPRRs in non-squamous epithelia might reflect a predisposition to undergo squamous metaplasia (23Song H.J. Poy G. Darwiche N. Lichti U. Kuroki T. Steinert P.M. Kartasova T. Genomics. 1999; 55: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 50Jetten A.M. De Luca L.M. Nelson K. Schroeder W. Burlingame S. Fujimoto W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 123: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Alternatively, SPRR genes could be involved in other forms of programmed cell death (apoptosis), which is known to occur in these tissues (51Gosden R. Spears N. Br. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 52Salamonsen L.A. Kovacs G.T. Findlay J.K. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Obstet. Gynaecol. 1999; 13: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A recent inspection of bladder epithelium with specific antibodies revealed SPRR1and SPRR3 expression in the most superficial (umbrella) cells. 3A., Cabral, A., Sayin, S., de Winter, D., Fischer, S. Pavel, and C. Backendorf, unpublished observations. Hence, a more thorough investigation, which is beyond the focus of this paper, will be imperative to assess the relevance of SPRR expression in these tissues. Whereas differential expression of individual SPRR genes is likely to reflect the specific barrier requirements of different epithelia, the UV experiment underlines the importance of barrier adaptation following external insults. UV responsiveness of SPRRs is not a novel finding, because they were originally isolated in our laboratory as UV inducible genes (17Kartasova T. van Muijen G.N. van Pelt-Heerschap H. van de Putte P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2204-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The novelty resides in the fact that specific members of this gene family are selectively induced by UV light. Consequently, induction of SPRR4, 2C, and 2G is not caused by a global effect of UV irradiation on the process of terminal differentiation, during which most SPRRs are induced (Fig. 4). This view is also supported by the finding that involucrin expression is not modulated after UV irradiation (Fig. 5). These results indicate that, besides providing resistance and flexibility to very specialized tissues, SPRRs might fulfill a major role in the adaptation of epithelial barriers to a large variety of external and endogenous stimuli. Recent evidence has indeed linked SPRR expression with barrier formation during mouse development (53Marshall D. Hardman M.J. Byrne C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 967-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Within the cornified cell envelope, which constitutes a major determinant of the protective barrier, SPRRs have a specialized role as they function as cross-bridging agents, which either interconnect or adjoin other CE precursor proteins. Both the structure and the concentration of the various SPRR proteins are believed to affect the biomechanical properties of the CE (25Kartasova T. Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 611Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It is possible that even small changes in amino acid composition can influence these parameters. Whereas the use of one specific class is probably dictated by tissue specific requirements, adaptation to external signals is likely to be more efficient by varying the concentration of a given SPRR protein. Both mechanisms are however by no means exclusive. Indeed, as various epithelia are exposed to specific insults, some correlation between tissue expression and responsiveness to a given agent can be expected. As such, the finding that SPRR2G and SPRR4, which are preferentially expressed in the epidermis, are also responsive to UV irradiation is not surprising. External insults can be numerous and can differ largely between different epithelia (e.g. UV irradiation for the epidermis, tobacco smoke, or food-derived chemicals for oral epithelia, acid reflux for esophagus). By taking into account this large diversity of external insults, which might request barrier function adaptation, it is unlikely that all these signals are channeled to a single regulatory promoter region. A gene family, coding for highly homologous proteins, regulated by specialized promoters, responding to both inducing and repressing signals, is likely to allow fine-tuning of the barrier, to guarantee optimal protection to the organism. The identification of two groups of UV inducible genes (dependent/independent on the culture conditions) within the SPRR2 class indicates that at least two different UV responsive signaling pathways selectively target specific members of the gene family. Other signal transduction cascades, initiated by other external or endogenous agents, are likely to regulate other family members. Our previous finding that the SPRR2A promoter, which is not affected by UV light (Fig. 5), is under the control of an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) (43Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), not present in other SPRR2 genes (Fig.6), supports such a view. Previous work from our laboratory has focused on the promoter regions of specific members of the SPRR1, 2, and 3 classes and has revealed that integration of signals transmitted via various signaling pathways plays an essential role in the regulation of these genes (43Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Such a strict regulation is a prerequisite for efficient barrier function adaptation. Indeed, ablation of the Klf4 transcription factor, one of the regulators of SPRR2 expression, results in severe barrier deficiency in the mouse (54Segre J.A. Bauer C. Fuchs E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Differential regulation of SPRR promoters relies on variations in the precise position of specific cis-elements within the global promoter context. This variation was recognized as a major factor in determining stimulus specific expression (40Sark M.W. Fischer D.F. de Meijer E. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24683-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 42Fischer D.F. Sark M.W. Lehtola M.M. Gibbs S. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Genomics. 1999; 55: 88-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, diversification of control elements is also seen in the promoter regions of the highly homologous SPRR2 genes (Fig. 6), in concert with their differential regulation. Differences include the deletion of an element (AP-1 site in 2B; ETS site in2F; octamer and ZNF site in 2G), the replacement of one element by another one (ISRE/ETS in 2A; TATA/initiator in 2C) and single point mutations in binding sites (AP-1 sites in 2D and 2G). This diversification in regulatory elements is likely to affect both the binding of specific transcription factors and their mutual cooperativity (43Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For instance, the absence of ETS sites inSPRR2F might explain the loss of regulation of this gene during in vitro keratinocyte differentiation (Fig. 5; Ref.43Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van De Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Whether the same change is also responsible for the unexpected high expression of this gene in non-squamous epithelia of the uterus and ovary is not yet known. In conclusion, we propose that the two structurally different groups of human SPRR genes provide on one hand specific resistance to very specialized tissues, whereas allowing on the other hand adaptation to a plethora of variable physiological and environmental insults. On this basis, the structural organization of the SPRR gene family reflects the functional duality with which epithelial barriers are confronted to guarantee optimal protection to the organism.

Some small non-peptidic structures, however, may also constitute specific agonist ligands for T cells, particularly γδ T lymphocytes. In human blood, about 3% of T cells initiate their physiological function upon recognition of small phosphorylated non-peptide antigens (phosphoantigens). This cognate interaction involves on the one hand phosphoantigens in the absence of major histocompatibility complex-presenting molecules, and on the other hand, highly selective receptors (TCR)1 of γδ subtype. In nature, phosphoantigens that can activate human γδ T cells at nanomolar concentrations are produced by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and also by some eukaryotic parasites and plants. Synthetic analogues of natural phosphoantigens are also known, but their stimulating concentrations for the reactive cells never go below the micromolar range. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent of human tuberculosis, produces four distinct phosphoantigens. These molecules share a moiety that is responsible for the potent stimulation of γδ cells seen in tuberculosis patients (1Constant P. Davodeau F. Peyrat M.A. Poquet Y. Puzo G. Bonneville M. Fournie J.J. Science. 1994; 264: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The structure of this common core is 3-formyl-1-butyl-pyrophosphate, a recently described phosphoester (2Belmant C. Espinosa E. Poupot R. Peyrat M.-A. Guiraud M. Poquet Y. Bonneville M. Fournié J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32079-32084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Its metabolic production might be related to the non-mevalonate (or so-called Rohmer's) pathway for isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis (3Sicard H. Fournié J.J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4375-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 3-formyl-1-butyl-pyrophosphate is produced in very small amounts in slow-growing mycobacteria such asMycobacterium tuberculosis and only accumulates to submicromolar concentrations in culture media from fast-growing mycobacterial species (4Poquet Y.

Getting large amounts of highly bioactive phosphoantigens by purification routes from such natural sources is therefore hard to conceive.Such molecules could prove therapeutically useful for immunotherapeutic approaches involving γδ T cell-mediated immunity, such as elicitation of anti-infectious protection or antitumor immunity (5Poccia F.

To address the need for readily available highly bioactive phosphoantigens, we have developed a synthetic reagent called bromohydrin pyrophosphate (BrHPP), whose biological properties on human T cells are optimized compared with those of 3-formyl-1-butyl-pyrophosphate.DISCUSSIONThis paper details the structure, chemical synthesis, and biological property of bromohydrin pyrophosphate, a novel molecule activating human γδ T lymphocytes. Based on the molecular overlay of this compound with the natural γδ T cell ligand found in mycobacteria, it was hoped that this synthetic compound could mimic the biological properties of the naturally occurring 3fbPP,i.e. activation of a specific γδ T cell subset in human blood (see Ref. 19Hayday A.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 975-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar for a review). We describe a convenient and straightforward mode of synthesis for producing BrHPP. This simple method is based on pyrophosphorylation of the tosylated C5 precursor, followed by stoichiometric oxidation of the pyrophosphoester product in aqueous bromine. Because the compound carries a chiral C3, the resulting product is a racemic mixture used without further resolution of enantiomers. This straightforward and inexpensive synthesis is followed by a purification scheme involving solvent precipitation, LC, and HPLC to eliminate residual inorganic phosphate and bromide. The final stock solutions of BrHPP (Na+) salts are very stable and can be stored for several months without degradation. Little information about structural changes of the organic moiety of phosphorylated metabolites is usually drawn from HPLC-MS in negative mode, thereby limiting its use as an analytical tool. The mass spectral data of BrHPP presented here demonstrate a highly sensitive detection of BrHPP in aqueous phases, and its bromine content enables unambiguous detection for pharmacological follow-up studies. For the reasons listed above, BrHPP appears to be a promising lead candidate for therapeutic explorations among synthetic phosphoantigens.In vitro cultures of bulk human lymphocytes carried out in the presence of 100 nm BrHPP and IL2 lead to the systematic expansion of T lymphocytes, which express the phosphoantigen-reactive γ9δ2 TCR, and no other cell subset. This has been described previously for total lymphocyte populations stimulated by crude extracts from M. tuberculosis and is known to rely upon the presence of several stimulating phosphoantigens. Here, BrHPP also acts as a phosphoantigen agonist, because BrHPP dephosphorylation abolishes this bioactivity. Exposure to BrHPP also elicits TNF-α and interferon-γ release, indicating that the full range of γδ T cell effector response is activated by this ligand. Microphysiometric analysis showed that this activation results from exposure to a typical activating agonist (20Rabinowitz J.D. Beeson C. Wulfing C. Tate K. Allen P.M. Davis M.M. McConnell H.M. Immunity. 1996; 5: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Its early signal transduction involves a BrHPP dose-dependent extracellular acid release, as was shown for αβ T cells stimulated with peptide-major histocompatibility complex tetramers (21Boniface J.J. Rabinowitz J.D. Wulfing C. Hampl J. Reich Z. Altman J.D. Kantor R.M. Beeson C. McConnell H.M. Davis M.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 459-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Whereas high bioactive doses of BrHPP triggered a strong acidification burst followed by a sustained intracellular signaling, suboptimal BrHPP concentrations (5 nm) led to barely detectable signaling. When rapidly exposed to saturating BrHPP concentrations, γδ cells respond by extracellular acidification within about 10 s, indicating that little (if any) intermediate processing of the stimulating BrHPP occurs prior to triggering the T cell reaction.In summary, although synthetic BrHPP presents the same biological properties as natural phosphoantigens, the possibility of synthesizing gram amounts from simple procedures bypasses the production drawbacks of the natural counterparts. This makes BrHPP an attractive candidate for investigations of selective γδ T cell-based immunomodulation approaches. Future studies will evaluate the potential of this novel immunostimulating molecule in subunit vaccines where γδ T cell contribution in vivo is expected to be beneficial, such as antituberculous immunity and protection against acute leukemia.APPENDIXReceptor/ligand bindings that were tested and found to be unaffected by 10 μm BrHPP are listed in Table I. The binding assays were performed as follows. For each receptor binding assay, the respective reference ligand was tested in duplicate at a minimum of eight concentrations to obtain a competition curve to validate the titration. In parallel, 10 μm BrHPP was tested in duplicate in each assay. Following incubation, the membranes or cells in suspension were rapidly harvested onto glass fiber filters with an ice-cold buffer using a cell harvester. Bound radioactivity was then measured with a scintillation counter (Betaplate, Wallac). The specific radioligand binding to the receptors is defined as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding determined in the presence of an excess of unlabelled ligand. Results are expressed as percent inhibition of control specific binding obtained in the presence of BrHPP. Conc. represents the concentration causing a half-maximal inhibition of control specific binding.Table IReceptor-ligands unaffected by BrHPP Stimulating ligands for αβ T lymphocytes are usually composed of single peptides complexed at the surface of major histocompatibility complex molecules.

One of the key structural features in the proposed reaction mechanism for the enzyme is the rotation of a 4′-ketopyranose intermediate within the active site pocket. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the human enzyme with bound NADH and UDP-glucose was determined. Unlike that observed for the protein isolated from Escherichia coli, the human enzyme can also turn over UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-GalNAc and vice versa. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of human epimerase complexed with NADH and UDP-GlcNAc. To accommodate the additionalN-acetyl group at the C2 position of the sugar, the side chain of Asn-207 rotates toward the interior of the protein and interacts with Glu-199. Strikingly, in the human enzyme, the structural equivalent of Tyr-299 in the E. coli protein is replaced with a cysteine residue (Cys-307) and the active site volume for the human protein is calculated to be ∼15% larger than that observed for the bacterial epimerase.

Members of this superfamily catalyze a wide range of biochemical reactions with some displaying dehydrogenase activities, and others acting as dehydratases, isomerases, or epimerases, for example (1Jörnvall H.

These enzymes are typically around 250 amino acid residues in length and contain two characteristic signature sequences. The first of these is a YXXXK motif in which the conserved tyrosine plays a key role in catalysis. The second of the signature sequences is a GXXXGXG motif, which is located near the cofactor-binding pocket. UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, the focus of this investigation and hereafter referred to as epimerase, is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. As outlined in SchemeFS1, the enzyme plays a pivotal role in the conversion of galactose to glucose 1-phosphate via the Leloir pathway. The specific function of epimerase in this metabolic pathway is to convert UDP-galactose back to UDP-glucose (step 3). Key features thought to be involved in the reaction mechanism of epimerase are indicated in Scheme FS2 and include: 1) abstraction of the 4′-hydroxyl hydrogen of the sugar, most likely by the conserved tyrosine residue contained in the YXXXK motif (4Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), 2) transfer of a hydride from C4 of the sugar to C4 of NAD+ leading to a 4′-ketopyranose intermediate and NADH, and finally 3) rotation of the resulting 4′-ketopyranose moiety in the active site, thereby allowing return of the hydride from NADH to the opposite face of the sugar. Extensive x-ray crystallographic analyses with the enzyme obtained from Escherichia coli have supported this catalytic mechanism (5Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M.

The human protein is a homodimer with each subunit containing 348 amino acid residues. One subunit of the “abortive complex” of the enzyme containing bound NADH and UDP-glucose is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the polypeptide chain folds into two distinct regions: the N-terminal domain (Met-1 to Thr-189) responsible primarily for NAD+/NADH positioning and the C-terminal motif (Gly-190 to Ala-348) involved in UDP-sugar binding. As expected for an enzyme that requires NAD+, the N-terminal domain is characterized by a modified Rossmann fold of seven strands of parallel β-sheet flanked on either side by α-helices. Additionally, the characteristic YXXXK motif of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily is located in this domain (Tyr-157-Gly-Lys-Ser-Lys-161). The C-terminal portion of the epimerase subunit is composed of six β-strands and five α-helices. Impairment of human epimerase results in epimerase deficiency galactosemia, a variant form of galactosemia with clinical severity that ranges from apparently benign to potentially lethal (10Holton J.B.

In addition to catalyzing the interconversion of UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose, the human enzyme is also capable of interconverting UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc (16Wohlers T.M. Christacos N.C.

To address the manner in which the human epimerase is able to bind and interconvert UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc, the structure of the abortive complex of the protein with bound NADH and UDP-GlcNAc has been solved to 1.5-Å resolution by x-ray crystallographic methods. Here we describe the structure of this ternary complex and compare it to that of the bacterial enzyme. Protein employed for this investigation was purified as described previously (4Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The ternary complex was prepared by treating the epimerase (15 mg/ml in the final dialysis buffer) with 5 mm NADH and 20 mm UDP-GlcNAc and allowing the solution to stand for 24 h at 4 °C. Large crystals were grown from 100 mm MES1(pH 6.0), 8–9% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, and 75 mm MgCl2 by macroseeding into batch experiments at 4 °C. Typically, the crystals achieved maximum dimensions of 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 1.0 mm in ∼2–3 weeks. For x-ray data collection, the crystals were first transferred to a synthetic mother liquor containing 15% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, 75 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm NADH, and 20 mmUDP-GlcNAc buffered at pH 6.0 with 100 mm MES. The crystals were then transferred to a cryoprotectant solution in two steps: first to an intermediate solution containing 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, 500 mm NaCl, and 20% (v/v) methanol and then to a similar solution that had been augmented with 4% (v/v) ethylene glycol. These crystals were suspended in a loop of 20-μm surgical thread and immediately flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas. The crystals belonged to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 63.4 Å, b = 88.9 Å, andc = 118.7 Å. The asymmetric unit contained one dimer. A native x-ray data set to 1.5-Å resolution was collected at the Advanced Photon Source (Structural Biology Center beamline 19-BM). These data were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Relevant x-ray data collection statistics are presented in TableI. The structure was solved via AMORE (22Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) using the previously determined epimerase/UDP-glucose/NADH structure as the starting model (4Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Initial refinement with the package TNT (23Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab A close-up view of the human epimerase active site with bound UDP-GlcNAc (subunit II) is shown in Fig.3 a. Nineteen water molecules are located within 4.0 Å of the NADH and UDP-GlcNAc moieties. Human epimerase is known to be a B-side-specific enzyme. As expected, the nicotinamide ring of the NADH is in thesyn-conformation with its si-face oriented toward the sugar ligand. Specifically, the distance between C4 of the UDP-GlcNAc ligand and C4 of the nicotinamide ring of the NADH is 3.0 Å. This distance in the previously determined human epimerase/UDP-glucose/NADH complex is somewhat longer at 3.5 Å (4Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As indicated by the dashed lines, the 4′-hydroxyl group of the sugar is located at 2.8 Å from Oγ of Ser-132 and 3.0 Å from Oη of Tyr-157. In the epimerase/UDP-glucose/NADH model, the distance between the 4′-hydroxyl group of the sugar and Oγ of Ser-132 is somewhat shorter at ∼2.4 Å while the distance between the sugar hydroxyl group and Oη of Tyr-157 is comparable at 3.1 Å (4Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This close distance of Oη of Tyr-157 to the 4′-hydroxyl group of the sugar is suggestive for the role of Tyr-157 as the catalytic base that abstracts the hydrogen during normal catalysis. A schematic of the hydrogen bonding pattern between the protein and the sugar substrate is displayed in Fig. 3 b. Eight water molecules lie within hydrogen bonding distance to the ligand. Key amino acid side chains responsible for positioning the sugar within the active site include Ser-132, Tyr-157, Asn-187, Arg-239, Arg-300, and Asp-303. Additionally, the backbone carbonyl or peptidic NH groups of Lys-92, Leu-208, Asn-224, and Phe-226 form hydrogen bonds with the UDP-GlcNAc moiety. The epimerase/UDP-GlcNAc/NADH abortive complex crystallized with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Interestingly, the α-carbons for the two subunits superimpose with quite a large root mean square deviation of 1.1 Å. The major differences between the two polypeptide chains, however, are confined to the N and C termini and to the surface loop delineated by Gly-41 to Gly-45. Shown in Fig.4 is a close-up view of the superposition of the two active sites contained within the asymmetric unit. Quite unexpectedly, the sugar moieties of the two ligands adopt substantially different orientations. In subunit I, displayed in red, C4 of the UDP-GlcNAc group is positioned at 4.6 Å from C4 of the nicotinamide ring of the dinucleotide. Additionally, its 4′-hydroxyl group lies at 3.3 Å from Oγ of Ser 132 and 4.6 Å from Oη of Tyr-157. Due to differences in the torsional angles about the phosphate backbones of the UDP-sugars, the GlcNAc group in subunit I swings out more toward the solvent and theN-acetyl group attached to C2 of the sugar adopts two different conformations as depicted in Fig. 4. Clearly these observed differences in sugar binding are in agreement with a catalytic mechanism that requires free rotation of a 4′-ketopyranose intermediate within the active site of the enzyme. One of the questions to be addressed by this study is the manner in which the human epimerase can accommodate both UDP-glucose and UDP-GlcNAc. A superposition of the two structures, namely the epimerase/UDP-glucose/NADH (subunit II) and the epimerase/UDP-GlcNAc/NADH (subunit II) abortive complexes, is displayed in Fig. 5. The α-carbons for these two models superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.50 Å. Clearly the more bulky N-acetyl group attached to C2 of the sugar is accommodated within the epimerase active site by a simple rotation of the carboxamide side chain group of Asn 207. By far the most extensive structural studies on UDP-galactose 4-epimerase to date have been conducted on the enzyme from E. coli. In one study, the structure of the bacterial enzyme/NADH/UDP-glucose abortive complex was solved in order to address the manner in which a sugar ligand binds within the active site (7Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all attempts to produce a similar abortive complex of the E. coli enzyme in the presence of UDP-galactose failed. Although crystals could be grown of the putative enzyme/UDP-galactose/NADH species, after x-ray data collection and processing, UDP-glucose rather than UDP-galactose was always observed binding in the active site. It was eventually possible to study the manner in which UDP-galactose binds to the bacterial enzyme, however, by preparing a “double” site-directed mutant protein in which Ser-124 and Tyr-149 were changed to alanine and phenylalanine residues, respectively. The x-ray crystallographic analysis of this “double” site-directed mutant protein demonstrated the manner in which UDP-galactose binds in the active site cleft (9Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11469-11477Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). From these analyses, it was shown that in the E. coliepimerase, Asn-179 (which is the structural equivalent to Asn-187 in the human enzyme) serves to hydrogen bond to either the 6′- or the 2′-hydroxyl groups when UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose, respectively, are bound in the active site. Additionally, in the E. colienzyme, Tyr-299 functions in sugar positioning where it also hydrogen bonds to either the 6′- or 2′-hydroxyl groups of UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose, respectively. It is particularly noteworthy that Tyr-299 is not conserved in the human enzyme but rather is replaced with a cysteine residue (Cys-307). A superposition of the E. coli epimerase with bound UDP-glucose onto the human epimerase with bound UDP-GlcNAc is shown in Fig. 6. The α-carbons for these two complexes correspond with a root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å. Note that the sugar moieties of the UDP-glucose bound to the E. coli enzyme (highlighted in blue) and the UDP-GlcNAc bound to the human epimerase (outlined in black) adopt similar orientations. Also shown in Fig. 6 is the conformation of UDP-galactose when it is positioned in the active site of the E. coli enzyme (displayed in red). From Fig. 6 it is clear that if UDP-GalNAc binds to the human enzyme in a similar manner to that observed for UDP-galactose in the bacterial protein, theN-acetyl group of the sugar ligand will lie quite close to the sulfhydryl group of Cys-307. Attempts to grow crystals of an abortive complex of the human enzyme with NADH and UDP-GalNAc have thus far been unsuccessful. Preparation of the “double” site-directed mutant protein of the human enzyme is presently in progress whereby Ser-132 and Tyr-157 are being changed, respectively, to alanine and phenylalanine residues. An x-ray analysis of this double site-directed mutant protein should clarify the manner in which UDP-GalNAc binds within the active site of the human enzyme. What is absolutely clear from this investigation is why the human enzyme can interconvert UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc while the bacterial enzyme has not been reported to display such activity. Calculations with the program VOIDOO (25Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Newsl. Protein Crystallogr. 1993; 29: 26-28Google Scholar, 26Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar) indicate that the active site for the human enzyme, as compared with that of the bacterial protein, is ∼15% larger in the region responsible for sugar binding. Furthermore, the replacement of Cys-307 in the human enzyme with the more bulky Tyr-299 in the bacterial protein most likely precludes UDP-GalNAc from binding in the E. coli active site in a productive mode. By the judicious use of various site-directed mutant proteins, it should be possible to test this hypothesis. Indeed, experiments are presently under way to construct a form of the E. coli epimerase that is catalytically active toward UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc.

Chem. 1999; 6: 457-467PubMed Google Scholar, 3Francis P. Chung J.J. Yasui M. Berry V. Moore A. Wyatt M.K. Wistow G. Bhattacharya S.S. Agre P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2329-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). AQP5 is a mammalian water channel expressed on alveolar type I and II cells, tracheal and bronchial epithelium in the lung, in salivary and lacrimal gland epithelia, and in corneal epithelium (4Nielsen S. King L.S. Christensen B.M. Agre P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1549-C1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Matsuzaki T. Suzuki T. Koyama H. Tanaka S. Takata K.

Whitsett, and A. G. Menon, submitted for publication. Mice that are deficient in AQP5 have decreased production of saliva as well as altered saliva composition (6Ma T. Song Y. Gillespie A.

V., Richardson, L., Towne, J. E., Doetschman, T., and Menon, A. G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, in press. In addition, AQP5 knockout mice have a 90% decrease in airspace-capillary water permeability (7Verkman A.S. Yang B. Song Y. Manley G.T. Ma T. Exp. Physiol. 2000; 85: 233S-241SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate the importance of AQP5 under normal conditions in both the salivary gland and lung. Several AQPs have recently been demonstrated to undergo complex regulation; for instance, AQP2 is regulated in response to vasopressin both at the transcriptional and post-translational levels as well as through shuttling of the protein to the membrane (8Deen P.M. van Balkom B.W. Kamsteeg E.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, multiple AQPs are regulated under pathophysiological conditions such as altered expression of AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, and AQP4 in the kidney in a number of water balance disorders (9Marples D. Frokiaer J. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F331-F339PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, through intratracheal infection of mice with adenovirus (10Ginsberg H.S. Moldawer L.L. Sehgal P.B. Redington M. Kilian P.L. Chanock R.M. Prince G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1651-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 11Harrod K.S. Mounday A.D. Stripp B.R. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L924-L930PubMed Google Scholar), Towne et al.(12Towne J.E. Harrod K.S. Krane C.M. Menon A.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) showed that AQP5 mRNA and protein expression are decreased in a mouse model of pulmonary inflammation and edema. The decreased expression of AQP5 was found uniformly throughout the lung and was not restricted to regions of overt inflammation, suggesting local effects of a diffusible factor released in response to adenoviral infection. AQP5 was decreased both 7 and 14 days after adenoviral infection; however, the mechanism responsible for the regulation of AQP5 in inflammation is unknown. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma, are increased in expression shortly after infection with adenovirus (10Ginsberg H.S. Moldawer L.L. Sehgal P.B. Redington M. Kilian P.L. Chanock R.M. Prince G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1651-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 12Towne J.E. Harrod K.S. Krane C.M. Menon A.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and may be potential mediators of the decrease in AQP5 expression. TNF-α is increased in mouse lungs as early as 6 h postinfection and remains elevated both 7 and 14 days after infection (12Towne J.E. Harrod K.S. Krane C.M. Menon A.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13Zsengeller Z. Otake K. Hossain S.A. Berclaz P.Y. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9655-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The possibility that cytokines may be responsible for the decrease of AQP5 in pulmonary inflammation was therefore hypothesized. TNF-α has been implicated in many biological conditions, most notably autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease), asthma, septic shock, and human immunodeficiency virus infection (14Eder J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 319-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Extensive studies show that TNF-α plays a pivotal role in inflammation including modulating the expression of many genes such as other proinflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins, major histocompatibility complex antigens, oncogenes, and transcription factors (14Eder J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 319-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 15Liu R.Y. Fan C. Liu G. Olashaw N.E. Zuckerman K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21086-21093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ability of TNF-α to induce such a wide variety of effects is likely because of its ability to activate multiple signal transduction pathways including mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (16Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). This study was therefore designed to assess directly the potential effects of TNF-α on AQP5 expression and to identify the signal transduction pathways mediating the response. Both AQP5 mRNA and protein expression are decreased in cultured murine lung epithelial cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner in response to TNF-α acting through the p55 type 1 TNF-α receptor 1 (TNFR1). This decrease in expression requires the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. To our knowledge these studies provide the first example of regulation of an aquaporin by TNF-α and also provide the first evidence that aquaporin expression can be regulated by NF-κB. Murine TNF-α (mTNF-α) and human TNF-α (hTNF-α) were obtained from Roche Biochemicals (Indianapolis). Monoclonal hamster anti-mouse TNFR1 (55R539) antibody was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis). PD98059 was obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA) and was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. U0126, SB205380, curcumin, MG-132, pyrrolidinedithiocarbonate (PDTC), and NF-κB SN50 inhibitor peptide were purchased from Calbiochem. U0126, SB203580, curcumin, and MG-132 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. PDTC and SN50 were both dissolved in RPMI medium with 1% fetal bovine serum. Quercetin and dicoumarol were purchased from Sigma. Quercetin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Dicoumarol was dissolved in ethanol. Electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. Reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal) and the BCA protein assay kit were from Pierce. The antibody to β-actin was an anti-mouse monoclonal antibody purchased from Sigma. The rabbit, anti-mouse AQP5 antibody (LL639; Lofstrand Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the mouse AQP5 carboxyl terminus and affinity purified on a SulfoLink column (Pierce) conjugated with the immunizing peptide (17Krane C.M. Towne J.E. Menon A.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were from Roche. Murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) were a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Whitsett (Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH) (18Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). MLE-12 cells were propagated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 3% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 48 h before study, cells were seeded onto six-well tissue culture dishes at 5 × 105 cells/well and were serum starved 24 h before study by replacing the medium with RPMI medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. In the MAP kinase and NF-κB inhibition studies, inhibitors were added in the specified concentrations for 1 h before the addition of 100 units/ml (1.5 ng/ml) mTNF-α as determined by a dose-response curve (see Fig. 1). Cells were then maintained in the medium for the duration of the experiment. Each experiment was replicated in its entirety at least twice with at least three independent wells/experimental group. Effects of TNF-α and the inhibitors PD98059, SB203580, and SN50 on cell viability were measured with a standard trypan blue uptake assay after treatment with 100 units/ml mTNF-α for 8 and 24 h. Cell cultures were also examined morphologically via light microscopy. Following the specified treatment, medium was aspirated, MLE cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 1 ml of TriReagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH) was added for the isolation of total RNA as per the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was solubilized in Formazol (Molecular Research Center, Inc.), and RNA concentrations were determined via spectrophotometry and confirmed with agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA, 5 μg/sample, was size fractionated by gel electrophoresis as described (12Towne J.E. Harrod K.S. Krane C.M. Menon A.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The AQP5 cDNA probe was generated as described previously (12Towne J.E. Harrod K.S. Krane C.M. Menon A.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As controls for loading of total RNA, the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA bands were examined with ultraviolet exposure of the ethidium bromide-stained gel, and subsequent to probing with AQP5, blots were stripped in boiling 0.5% SDS for 30 min and reprobed with a mouse L32 ribosomal protein mRNA probe as described (12Towne J.E. Harrod K.S. Krane C.M. Menon A.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 19Dudov K.P. Perry R.P. Cell. 1984; 37: 457-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Northern blots probed with either the AQP5 or L32 were quantified by exposure of a phosphor screen, scanned by means of a Storm 840 scanner, and analyzed using ImageQuant software (all from Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). RNA values are reported as the AQP5/L32 ratio for each sample. Phosphorimaging results are reported as volume-integrated values and are expressed in percentages compared with the mean values in controls (vehicle-treated) (100%). Following treatment of cells in the specified medium for the indicated amount of time, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Ice-cold isolation solution (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, adjusted to pH 7.6) was added to each well for scraping and collecting of the cells. Cells were then lysed via three successive freezing and thawing cycles in dry ice and a 37 °C water bath, respectively. Total protein content was determined by the BCA assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cell homogenates, 5 μg/sample, were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (12Towne J.E. Harrod K.S. Krane C.M. Menon A.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-AQP5 antibody at a dilution of 0.5 μg/ml and anti-β-actin antibody at a dilution of 1:50,000 in 0.5% blocking solution (Roche). After washing, the membranes were incubated with 100 milliunits/ml horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody and 50 milliunits/ml peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed again, and visualized via enhanced chemiluminescence with variable film exposures. For quantification, films of Western blots were scanned using a Hewlett-Packard scanner and Adobe Photoshop. Scanning was performed using chemiluminescence exposures that gave control bands in the lower gray scale. The labeling density was quantified using ImageQuant software. Values for AQP5 were corrected by quantification of the β-actin values and were expressed as an AQP5/β-actin ratio. Densitometry results are reported as volume-integrated values and expressed in percentages compared with the mean values in controls (vehicle-treated) (100%). Statistical analysis of AQP5/L32 density ratios for RNA expression and AQP5/β-actin density ratios for protein expression were performed using unpaired Student'st test with equal variance. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. MLE-12 cells were utilized to examine the effects of TNF-α on AQP5 mRNA and protein expression. MLE-12 cells were treated with various concentrations of mTNF-α for various time points to determine whether the response to TNF-α was dose- and time-dependent. Cells were incubated in media supplemented with 10, 50, 100, 500, or 1,000 units/ml mTNF-α for 8 h before isolation of total RNA for Northern blot analysis. AQP5 mRNA levels were decreased significantly with 50, 100, and 500 units/ml mTNF-α treatment (Fig. 1, A andB). AQP5 protein levels were decreased significantly after 24 h of treatment with 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 units/ml mTNF-α (Fig. 1, C and D) in a dose-dependent manner. AQP5 mRNA and protein were decreased maximally after treatment with 100 units/ml mTNF-α, therefore this concentration was used for subsequent experiments. To analyze the time course of TNF-α-mediated inhibition of AQP5 expression, MLE-12 cells were treated with mTNF-α for various time points before isolation of total RNA. AQP5 mRNA was decreased significantly to about 50% of control (medium alone) levels after 4, 8, and 24 h of treatment with mTNF-α (Fig.2, A and B). However, after 48 h of treatment with TNF-α, AQP5 mRNA returned to control levels (Fig. 2, A and B). AQP5 protein was decreased dramatically to about 10% of control levels after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment with mTNF-α (Fig. 2,C and D). Therefore, although AQP5 mRNA returns to base-line levels by 48 h of treatment with mTNF-α, AQP5 protein levels do not return to base line even by 72 h, suggesting that the regulation of this gene is accomplished at both the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional levels. The decrease in AQP5 mRNA and protein expression was not the result of apoptosis or the general inhibition of cell metabolism because the number of live cells (trypan blue exclusion) and the protein content after 24 and 48 h of incubation with 100 units/ml mTNF-α were the same in control and TNF-α-treated cells (data not shown). Examination of cells by light microscopy demonstrated that cells treated with mTNF-α remained adherent and morphologically similar to control cells. The quality and quantity of total RNA recovered and L32 mRNA contents visualized on the same blots as AQP5 mRNA were not influenced by TNF-α. These data demonstrate that AQP5 mRNA and protein are decreased in MLE-12 cells after treatment with TNF-α in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The first step in TNF action is binding to specific receptors that are expressed on the plasma membrane of virtually all cells except erythrocytes (20Guo D. Dunbar J.D. Yang C.H. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2742-2750PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Two distinct receptors for TNF-α have been identified, the p55 type 1 receptor (TNFR1) and the p75 type 2 receptor (TNFR2) (21Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 22Ledgerwood E.C. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors share structural homology in the extracellular TNF-α binding domains and exhibit similar binding affinities for TNF-α, but they induce separate cytoplasmic signaling pathways after receptor-ligand binding (21Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 22Ledgerwood E.C. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse TNF-α, which was utilized in all previous experiments, is capable of binding to and signaling through both TNF-α receptors on mouse cells (23Brinkman B.M. Telliez J.B. Schievella A.R. Lin L.L. Goldfeld A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30882-30886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The monoclonal TNFR1 agonist antibody 55R539 specifically binds to and activates signaling through TNFR1 and does not cross-react with TNFR2 (22Ledgerwood E.C. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sheehan K.C. Pinckard J.K. Arthur C.D. Dehner L.P. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To determine which TNF-α receptor signals the decrease in AQP5, we treated MLE-12 cells with the TNFR1 agonist antibody 55R539 and measured AQP5 mRNA and protein levels. MLE-12 cells were treated with the TNFR1 agonist antibody at 0.33, 1, or 3 μg/ml or with mTNF-α for 8 h, and AQP5 mRNA expression was evaluated. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that activation of TNFR1 by treatment of MLE-12 cells with all three concentrations of the TNFR1 agonist antibody reduced AQP5 mRNA expression to an extent similar to that obtained by the simultaneous triggering of both receptors by mouse TNF-α (Fig. 3, A andB). In addition, human TNF-α, which specifically binds and activates TNFR1 on murine cells (20Guo D. Dunbar J.D. Yang C.H. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2742-2750PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennett G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), also promotes decreased AQP5 expression (data not shown). Treatment of MLE-12 cells with either mouse TNF-α or 1 or 3 μg/ml agonist TNFR1 antibody for 24 h also resulted in a similar decrease in AQP5 protein (Fig. 3,C and D). Therefore, stimulation of TNFR1 alone decreases both AQP5 mRNA and protein expression to a level equal to that seen with mouse TNF-α, suggesting that decreased AQP5 expression in response to TNF-α is mediated principally through TNFR1. Signaling through TNFR1 leads to distinct effector functions, including MAP kinase activation and the activation of NF-κB (14Eder J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 319-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1999; 58, Suppl. 1: I2-I13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α activates signaling through three MAP kinase pathways: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 (16Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, 22Ledgerwood E.C. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar), and all three pathways are activated by mTNF-α treatment of MLE-12 cells (27Yang G.H. Bachurski C.J. FASEB J. 2000; 114: A1428Google Scholar). To investigate the possible involvement of the ERK cascade in decreased AQP5 expression in response to TNF-α, the effects of the MEK1/2 (the upstream kinase of ERK1/2) inhibitor PD98059 (28Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar, 29Hoffert J.D. Leitch V. Agre P. King L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9070-9077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were examined. PD98059 inhibits MEK1/2 by blocking activation of MEK1/2 by Raf kinase (28Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). 20 μm PD98059 was added to MLE cells for 1 h before the addition of mTNF-α, and cells were collected for RNA isolation 8 h after the addition of TNF-α. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the addition of PD98059 alone did not alter AQP5 mRNA expression significantly. AQP5 mRNA expression was decreased to the same extent with the addition of PD98059 and TNF-α as with TNF-α alone (Fig. 4,A and B). Therefore, decreased AQP5 mRNA expression in response to TNF-α does not require signaling through ERK MAP kinase. To examine the effect of ERK inhibition on AQP5 protein expression in response to TNF-α, MLE-12 cells were treated with 20 μmPD98059 for 1 h before the addition of TNF-α, and cell homogenates were collected 24 h after the addition of TNF-α. Western blot analysis demonstrated that AQP5 protein was unaltered with the addition of PD98059 alone; when PD98059 was incubated in combination with TNF-α, AQP5 expression was decreased to the same extent as with TNF-α alone (Fig. 4, C and D). Together these data demonstrate that the MEK inhibitor PD98059 has no effect on either the decrease in AQP5 mRNA or protein expression seen in response to TNF-α. Therefore, decreased AQP5 expression in response to TNF-α does not require activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway. Similar results were obtained with the use of SB203580, a drug that specifically inhibits p38 kinase activity (30Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar, 31Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). MLE-12 cells were treated with 10 μm SB203580 for 1 h before the addition of TNF-α. Cells were then isolated 8 and 24 h after the addition of TNF-α for RNA and protein isolation, respectively. SB203580 alone did not alter AQP5 mRNA or protein expression significantly (Fig. 5, A–D), and addition of the inhibitor plus TNF-α resulted in a decrease in AQP5 expression which was similar to that with TNF-α alone (Fig. 5,A–D). These data show that the p38 inhibitor SB203580 has no effect on the decrease in AQP5 mRNA and protein expression seen in response to TNF-α, suggesting that decreased AQP5 expression in response to TNF-α does not require activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Several compounds have been demonstrated to inhibit activation of JNK by TNF-α; however, these inhibitors are fairly nonspecific for JNK and affect other processes in the cell. Dicoumarol is a quinone reductase inhibitor (32Cross J.V. Deak J.C. Rich E.A. Qian Y. Lewis M. Parrott L.A. Mochida K. Gustafson D. Vande Pol S. Templeton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31150-31154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that has been demonstrated to inhibit JNK activation; however, use of this compound in combination with TNF-α resulted in rapid cell death, thus the effect of dicoumarol on AQP5 expression could not be assessed. Quercetin and curcumin are a plant flavanoid and pigment, respectively, and previously they have been demonstrated to inhibit JNK activation (33Kobuchi H. Roy S. Sen C.K. Nguyen H.G. Packer L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C403-C411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Chen Y.R. Tan T.H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 35Chen A. Davis B.H. Bissonnette M. Scaglione-Sewell B. Brasitus T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35505-35513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Use of both inhibitors individually resulted in decreased AQP5 mRNA expression with inhibitor alone (data not shown). Expression was not decreased further with inhibitor plus TNF-α. However, curcumin has been demonstrated to decrease NF-κB activation as well as JNK activation (34Chen Y.R. Tan T.H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), so the effects of this inhibitor could be the result of inhibition of either pathway. These results could suggest that JNK and/or NF-κB activation is necessary for both basal and decreased AQP5 expression in response to TNF-α. NF-κB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is activated by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukin-1 (14Eder J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 319-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 26Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. Ann. Rheum.

In addition, studies have demonstrated that TNF-α activates NF-κB by signaling through TNFR1 (36Baeuerle P.A. Curr.

Under unstimulated conditions, NF-κB dimers are retained in an inactive form in the cytoplasm through association with one of the IκB proteins. Upon stimulation, IκB molecules are rapidly phosphorylated and degraded through a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, thus unmasking a nuclear localization signal in NF-κB.

It is known that mitochondrial translation factors can function on both mitochondrial and Escherichia coliribosomes, indicating that protein components in the mitoribosome compensate the reduced rRNA chain to make a bacteria-type ribosome. To elucidate the molecular basis of this compensation, we analyzed bovine mitoribosomal large subunit proteins; 31 proteins were identified including 15 newly identified proteins with their cDNA sequences from human and mouse. The results showed that the proteins with binding sites on rRNA shortened or lost in the mitoribosome were enlarged when compared with the E. coli counterparts; this suggests the structural compensation of the rRNA deficit by the enlarged proteins in the mitoribosome.AB049474AB049632AB049657 The mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) is a highly protein-rich particle in which almost half of the rRNA contained in the bacterial ribosome is replaced with proteins.

Because almost all nucleotide residues in rRNA and many protein components were unambiguously assigned in the electron density maps, we have a better understanding of how rRNA and proteins assemble to make a functional ribosome. The most notable finding was that the functional regions for peptide bond formation in the large subunit (9Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar,12Muth G.W. Ortoleva-Donnelly L. Strobel S.A.

Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) consist entirely of rRNA. The ribosome is thus a ribozyme (9Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 12Muth G.W. Ortoleva-Donnelly L. Strobel S.A. Science. 2000; 289: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). As compared with the bacterial ribosome, the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) provides another intriguing model for elucidating the molecular basis of ribosome function. The mitoribosome has a smaller sedimentation coefficient of 55 S (14O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3409-3417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) consisting of large 39 S subunit and small 28 S subunits; the former contains 16 S, and the latter contains 12 S rRNAs as RNA components without bacterial 5 S rRNA counterpart. Total length of the mitochondrial rRNA is about half that of the bacterial ribosome. Recently, the physiochemical properties of rat mitoribosome were precisely determined (15Patel V.B. Cunningham C.C. Hantgan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6739-6746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Rat mitoribosome has a large molecular mass (3.57 MDa) compared with that of E. coli ribosome (2.49 MDa), which is explained by the fact that the protein to RNA ratio is completely reversed (16Hamilton M.G. O'Brien T.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5400-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This suggests that large parts of the RNA domains are replaced by protein components during the process of mitochondrial evolution from an eubacteria-like endosymbiont in a progenitor of eukaryotic cells. Functional equivalency of the mammalian mitoribosome to E. coli ribosome has been suggested by the fact that mitochondrial translation factors are able to function efficiently on E. coli ribosomes. Mammalian mitochondrial elongation factors (EF-Tu mt1 and EF-G mt) can be replaced by bacterial factors and maintain their efficient activities on the E. coli ribosome (17Schwartzbach C.J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19125-19131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chung H.K. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21000-21004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and even bacterial and chloroplast EF-Tus can cooperate with the bovine mitoribosome andE. coli tRNAs to some extent (17Schwartzbach C.J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19125-19131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, initiation factor 2 from bovine mitochondria also functions on the bacterial ribosome (19Ma J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5805-5811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Liao H.X. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20714-20719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observations indicate that the mitochondrial factors are exchangeable with bacterial factors on bacterial ribosome. Systematic analysis of protein components in the mitoribosome is necessary to elucidate the molecular basis of exchangeability of these factors. O'Brien and co-workers (21Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were the first to isolate proteins from bovine mitoribosome by two-dimensional PAGE. They identified 52 protein spots in the large subunit and 33 protein spots in the small subunit (21Matthews D.E. Hessler R.A. Denslow N.D. Edwards J.S. O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8788-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increased number of proteins in the mitoribosome as compared with the E. coli ribosome suggested a structural and functional compensation of the shortened rRNA in the mitoribosome by the protein moiety. Peptide analysis and cDNA cloning of each protein component is required to characterize the mitoribosome in more detail. Until 1998, only a few protein sequences had been reported (22Pietromonaco S.F. Denslow N.D. O'Brien T.W. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Marty L.

Based on the human genome data base and EST sequences, more than 20 mitoribosomal proteins have been identified from rat and bovine mitoribosomes using N-terminal sequencing and data base screening (24Goldschmidt-Reisin S.

In this study, we systematically analyzed the large subunit proteins of bovine mitoribosome by peptide analysis using mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. We identified 31 mitoribosomal proteins including 15 new members, with their complete human and mouse cDNA sequences. A striking result was that the mitoribosomal proteins whose binding sites on rRNA are shortened or lost carry an N- or C-terminal extension, whereas the proteins with conserved rRNA binding sites have similar molecular weights when compared with those of the E. coli counterparts. Three-dimensional orientations of the enlarged proteins and the concomitantly lost or shortened rRNA domains were mapped on the crystal structure of the 50 S subunit to investigate how proteins cover the shortened RNA domains to construct the functional mitoribosome. The enlarged proteins together with several extra proteins that are specifically found in the mitoribosome obviously provide both structural and functional compensation for the deficit of rRNA in mitoribosome, so that the whole molecular architecture of the ribosome is conserved in bacteria and mitochondria. The mitoribosome thus serves as a good model system for defining the functional domains of rRNA in more detail and also for an experimental verification of the concept of transition from the “RNA world” to the “RNP world” in the early process of evolution of life. Mitochondria were prepared from a fresh bovine liver according to the literature (46Schwartzbach C.J. Farwell M. Liao H.X. Spremulli L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 248-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crude mitoribosomes were prepared as reported (20Liao H.X. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20714-20719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in the 55 S buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The 55 S mitoribosome was purified by the sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the 55 S buffer containing sucrose. The concentrations of sucrose were 6% for the top layer and 38% for the bottom layer. Before centrifugation, a linear sucrose gradient was formed in the centrifuge tubes (Seton) by Gradient Mate model 117 (BioComp) according to the user's manual. EightyA 260 units of mitoribosome, dissolved in 0.6 ml of the 55 S buffer without sucrose, were layered onto the gradient. Centrifugation was run at 20,000 rpm for 18 h using the SW28 rotor (Beckman). The gradient was fractionated from the top to the bottom using the Piston Gradient Fractionater (BioComp). Fractions containing 55 S mitoribosomes were pooled and collected by the ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 24 h using the 70 Ti rotor (Beckman). The purified 55 S mitoribosome was dissociated into 39 S and 28 S subunits in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Each subunit was purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 16 h using the SW28 rotor. The purified 55 S, 39 S, and 28 S ribosomal subunits were dissolved in the 55 S buffer and stored at −70 °C. Total ribosomal proteins were extracted from the purified 55 S mitoribosome by stirring for 1 h at 4 °C in 600 μl of the solution containing 50 mm magnesium acetate, 50%(v/v) acetic acid; 13.3A 260 units (425 pmol) of mitoribosome were used. After removing the insoluble fraction by centrifugation, total soluble proteins were precipitated in 5 times the volume of acetone at −80 °C for 1 h. The total proteins were centrifuged, and the protein pellet was dried. The proteins were then denatured and reduced at 40 °C for 30 min in 60 μl of the reaction mixture consisting of 8 m urea, 0.2 m2-mercaptoethanol, 0.074% acetic acid, 0.012 n KOH, 0.015% acridine orange, and 0.015% pylonine G. The resultant sample was subjected to RFHR two-dimensional PAGE analysis according to the literature (30Wada A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 100: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 47Wada A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 100: 1595-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The protein spots on RFHR two-dimensional gel were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, excised, and completely dried in vacuo. The dried gel pieces were then rehydrated with 5–10 μl of the trypsin digest solution (0.2 mNH4HCO3, 15 ng/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (Pierce)). After the gel pieces absorbed the liquid, 10–20 μl of 0.2m NH4HCO3 was added to the gel. Complete digestion was carried out overnight at 30 °C. The digested peptides were extracted from the gel by shaking in 200 μl of 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA solution for 20 min. This step was repeated two more times. The collected fractions containing peptides were batched together and dried in a speedvac, and the obtained sample was dissolved in 80 μl of 0.1% formic acid. For the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, the gel piece was soaked in a buffer containing 0.2 m NH4HCO3with 50% acetonitrile and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min to remove SDS from the proteins. To assure the complete removal of SDS, the step was repeated twice. Subsequent treatment of the sample was same as described above. A Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest) equipped with an electrospray ionization source was used for the peptide analysis of mitoribosomal proteins. The LC/MS analysis was performed using an ODS reverse-phase column (Monitor C18, 0.1 × 15 cm; Michrom BioResource) connected on-line to the electrospray interface. A solvent system consisting of 0.1% formic acid in H2O (A) and in acetonitrile (B) was developed from 0% to 70% B in 35 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min by using the Magic 2002 high performance liquid chromatography system (Michrom BioResource). The flow rate of sheath gas and the capillary temperature were kept at 55 arbitrary units and 235 °C, respectively. The zoom scan analysis and MS/MS experiment by collision-induced dissociation using the data dependent scan (triple play) were performed in the range of 300–2000m/z throughout the separation. An uninterpreted data set of the peptide product ion for each protein generated from the triple play analysis was searched against the nonredundant protein data base and human and mouse EST data bases using the SEQUEST search program (32Dongre A.R. Eng J.K. Yates III, J.R. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 418-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 48Gatlin C.L. Eng J.K. Cross S.T. Detter J.C. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The excised gel pieces were dried in vacuo and soaked in a buffer consisting of 10 mm CAPS-NaOH (pH 11) and 10% methanol for 1 h. The each protein in a gel was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Fluorotrans, Paul) by electroelution using the Electroelutor (Nihon Eido, Japan). Amino acid sequencing was performed using a gas-phase protein sequencer (PPSQ-21, Shimadzu). To understand the compensation mechanism of the RNA deficit by proteins to maintain ribosomal function, we first analyzed the protein content in the large subunit of the mitoribosome. Since the crude ribosome fraction obtained by ultracentrifugation of the mitoplast extract contained various proteins for metabolisms and amino acid biosynthesis (data not shown), 55 S mitoribosomes were purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Furthermore, the large 39 S subunit was isolated from the purified 55 S mitoribosome by sucrose density gradient centrifugation under a low Mg2+concentration. The proteins of the purified 55 S mitoribosome were isolated by RFHR two-dimensional PAGE (30Wada A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 100: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Wada A. Yamazaki Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2657-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which has a wide separation range in the basic region and, thus, applies well for ribosomal proteins. RFHR two-dimensional PAGE requires no SDS, thereby simplifying the peptide analysis of gel-purified protein by LC/MS spectrometry. More than 70 protein spots were identified in the gel (Fig. 1 A). Each protein component of the 39 S subunit was analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, as shown in Fig. 1 B. Each protein spot from the 55 S mitoribosome and 39 S large subunit was treated with trypsin in the gel. The tryptic peptides were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis by LC/MS/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A total of 27 proteins were identified as ribosomal proteins from the large 39 S subunit (Fig. 1 B). An example (L11mt) for the investigation of the LC/MS/MS analysis is shown in Fig. 2 A. The triple play analysis by a data-dependent scan was performed for each bovine protein to obtain the information on the molecular mass (upper panel), charge state (middle panel), and fragment patterns for each peptide (lower panel) within one analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). The data set of the LC/MS/MS analysis was matched against the nonredundant protein data base of human (and mouse) EST data base by the algorithm SEQUEST (32Dongre A.R. Eng J.K. Yates III, J.R. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 418-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the partial cDNA sequences encoding the analyzed proteins were obtained. High homology in the amino acid sequences of mammalian mitoribosomal proteins led to many primary hits in the human (and mouse) EST data base. A series of related EST sequences were retrieved by BLASTN search (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar), with the hit sequence as a query and assembledin silico to make the longest possible cDNA sequences. Sequencing errors were identified and corrected by comparing overlapping EST clones. Since ribosomal proteins are relatively small in general, highly reliable cDNA sequences containing complete open reading frames were obtained. Taking the analysis of L11 homologue (bMRP-32) as an example, two EST sequences from human (AI188527) and mouse (AA272356) were obtained from an initial SEQUEST search. The possible longest cDNA sequence was obtained by assembling numerous related EST sequences. A complete open reading frames of L11 homologue was encoded in the sequence as shown in Fig. 2 B. Many peptide ions derived from this protein sequence were identified in the mass spectra and assigned in the mass chromatogram (Fig. 2 A,left upper panel). Furthermore, a partial or complete sequence of each peptide was assigned in the collision-induced dissociation spectrum, as shown in Fig. 2 A (right lower panel). For four small proteins, namely bMRP-59b, -66, -68, and -69, N-terminal sequences were directly determined by the peptide sequencing and the EST data base analysis using the TBLASTN program (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, NHE1 is activated in cells stimulated with growth factors. We showed previously that activation of the exchanger is dependent on phosphorylation of serine 703 (Ser(P)703) by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). Because the NHE1 sequence at Ser(P)703 (RIGSDP) is similar to a consensus sequence (RSXSXP) specific for 14-3-3 ligands, we evaluated whether serum stimulated 14-3-3 binding to NHE1. Five different GST-NHE1 fusion proteins spanning amino acids 515–815 were phosphorylated by RSK and used as ligands in a far Western analysis; only those containing Ser(P)703 exhibited high affinity 14-3-3 binding. In PS127A cells (NHE1-overexpressing Chinese hamster fibroblasts) stimulated with 20% serum, NHE1 co-precipitation with GST-14-3-3 fusion protein increased at 5 min (5.2 ± 0.4-foldversus control; p < 0.01) and persisted at 40 min (3.9 ± 0.3-fold; p < 0.01). We confirmed that binding occurs at the RIGSDP motif using PS120 (NHE1 null) cells transfected with S703A-NHE1 or P705A-NHE1 (based on data indicating that 14-3-3 binding requires phosphoserine and +2 proline). Serum failed to stimulate association of 14-3-3 with these mutants. A GST-NHE1 fusion protein was phosphorylated by RSK and used as a ligand to assess the effect of 14-3-3 on protein phosphatase 1-mediated dephosphorylation of Ser(P)703. GST-14-3-3 limited dephosphorylation (66% of initial state at 60 min) compared with GST alone (27% of initial state; p < 0.01). The protective effect of GST-14-3-3 was lost in the GST-NHE1 P705A mutant. Finally, the base-line rate of pH recovery in acid-loaded cells was equal in unstimulated cells expressing wild-type or P705A-NHE1. However, activation of NHE1 by serum was dramatically inhibited in cells expressing P705A-NHE1 compared with wild-type (0.13 ± 0.02versus 0.48 ± 0.06 mmol of H+/min/liter, p < 0.01). These data suggest that 14-3-3 binding to NHE1 participates in serum-stimulated exchanger activation, a new function for 14-3-3.

Na+/H+ exchanger isoform-1 vascular smooth muscle cell(s) extracellular signal-regulated kinase glutathione S-transferase mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase/ERK kinase spontaneously hypertensive rat Wistar-Kyoto ribosomal S6 kinase fetal calf serum polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis NHE11 is the ubiquitous form of the Na+/H+ exchanger, responsible for regulation of intracellular pH and cell volume. NHE1 has increased activity in hypertensive patients and in animal models of hypertension, and the exchanger can be stimulated by various exogenous factors. In several examples of increased NHE1 activity, the primary change is not in NHE1 expression but in post-translational regulation of activity. In immortalized cells from hypertensive patients, enhanced NHE1 activity appears to reflect increased Vmax rather than increased NHE1 mRNA (1Rosskopf D. Fromter E. Siffert W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2553-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Similarly, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) show an increasedVmax compared with their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) counterparts but do not overexpress NHE1 mRNA or protein (2Lucchesi P.A. DeRoux N. Berk B.C. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Siczkowski M. Davies J.E. Ng L.L. J.

Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 78-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is no evidence for genetic linkage between the Na+/H+ exchanger gene and human hypertension (5Lifton R.P. Hunt S.C. Williams R.R. Pouysségur J. Lalouel J.M. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and no mutations have been detected in the entire coding region of NHE1 in SHR compared with WKY (6Orlov S.N. Adarichev V.A. Devlin A.M. Maximova N.V. Sun Y.L. Tremblay J. Dominiczak A.F. Postnov Y.V. Hamet P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1500: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hence, increased NHE1 activity in hypertension is best explained by altered intracellular regulation of the exchanger. In support of this concept, phosphorylation of NHE1 by growth factors was increased in the SHR compared with the WKY (7Siczkowski M. Davies J.E. Ng L.L. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). NHE1 is activated in cells stimulated with numerous agonists. Epidermal growth factor, thrombin, phorbol esters, and serum were first found to stimulate Na+/H+ exchanger phosphorylation concurrently with a rise in intracellular pH (8Sardet C. Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Science. 1990; 247: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). p160 ROCK mediates lysophosphatidic acid-induced activation of NHE1 via carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation (9Tominaga T. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Barber D.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which in turn stimulates NHE1 phosphorylation and activity (10Phan V.N. Kusuhara M. Lucchesi P.A. Berk B.C. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Takahashi E. Abe J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In fact, ERK1/2 activation appears to be a common denominator in the process of NHE1 activation by several growth factors, since MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway inhibition with PD98059 or use of a dominant negative ERK1 construct blocks activation of the exchanger by α1-adrenergic receptor agonists, serum, endothelin, platelet-derived growth factor, thrombin, and phorbol esters among others (12Aharonovitz O.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9151-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in lymphoblasts from hypertensive patients, increased NHE1 activity and phosphorylation correlated with enhanced ERK1/2 activity, although there were no apparent differences in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK between cells from hypertensive and normotensive patients (17Sweeney F.P. Quinn P.A. Ng L.L. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 297-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Indeed, the relative activity of the ERK pathway in hypertension remains controversial (18Lucchesi P.A. Bell J.M. Willis L.S. Byron K.L. Corson M.A. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Kim S. Murakami T. Izumi Y. Yano M. Miura K. Yamanaka S. Iwao H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We showed previously that activation of NHE1 by serum was dependent on phosphorylation of serine 703 (Ser(P)703) by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), which in turn was directly regulated by ERK1/2 (20Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the NHE1 sequence at Ser(P)703 (RIGSDP) is similar to a consensus sequence (RSXSXP) specific for binding of 14-3-3. Indeed, 14-3-3 ligands share a common binding determinant that mediates their interaction with 14-3-3. First described for Raf-1, the consensus recognition motif RSXpSXP (whereX designates any amino acid and pS represents phosphoserine) applies to most known binding partners of 14-3-3 (21Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). In the overwhelming majority of interactions documented so far, 14-3-3 necessitates a phosphorylated serine for binding. For example, mutants of Raf-1 where Ser259 or Ser621are mutated to alanine have reduced binding to 14-3-3 (22Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). An arginine in the −3 or −4-position is also crucial, as is the proline at +2, although in some instances changes in the proline may be tolerated (23Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S.

The phosphoserine contacts 14-3-3 by salt bridges to side chains contained within the aliphatic groove of 14-3-3. In the case of 14-3-3ζ, mutations of residues within this groove (K49E, R56E, or R127E) diminish interaction with binding partners Raf1 and Bcr (25Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity between our proposed 14-3-3 binding site in NHE1 and those identified in known 14-3-3 ligands, we hypothesized that phosphorylation of NHE1 at serine 703 would create a binding site for 14-3-3. In addition, we postulated that 14-3-3 binding would modulate NHE1 activity. In the present study, we show that 14-3-3β associates with NHE1 in cells stimulated by serum, and using mutants of NHE1 we determined that this interaction occurs at serine 703. Functionally, binding of 14-3-3 to the exchanger was necessary for activation of NHE1 by serum, an effect that correlated with diminished dephosphorylation of Ser(P)703 observed when NHE1 is bound to 14-3-3. Preparation of overlapping GST fusion proteins spanning amino acids 516–815, comprising the entire cytoplasmic domain of NHE1, was described previously (11Takahashi E. Abe J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Five constructs, NHE1-(516–630), NHE1-(625–747), NHE1-(747–815), NHE1-(625–670), and NHE1-(625–714), were used (Fig. 1). GST-14-3-3 was a gift from Dr. A. J. Muslin (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). After transformation of GST constructs into the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli, cultures were grown to the sublog phase and induced for 3 h at 37 °C with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma). Cells were collected, sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at 4 °C, and bound fusion proteins were washed extensively with fusion protein lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% Nonidet P-40). Purified GST-NHE1 fusion proteins were stimulated with RSK (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 12 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 units of p90 RSK2 (Upstate Biotechnology Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), 10 mm ATP) and then resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. GST-14-3-3 fusion proteins were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using protein kinase A buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 12 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μl of protein kinase A, 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP), and used to probe the membranes. Alternatively, membranes containing GST-14-3-3 were probed with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled GST-NHE1 constructs. PS127A cells (Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts that overexpress human NHE1) and PS120 cells (Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts deficient in NHE1) were gifts of Dr. J. Pouysségur (University of Nice, France). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were serum-starved (0% FCS) overnight prior to experiments. Control PS127A and PS120 cells and cells stimulated with 20% FCS for 5–40 min, with or without PD98059 (Calbiochem), were harvested using NHE1 lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 10 g/liter polyoxyethylene-8-lauryl ether, 1 mm o-phenanthroline, 1 mm indoacetamide, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Cells were immediately frozen on ethanol/dry ice, and the cell lysates were then thawed on ice, scraped, sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants were used immediately. Cell lysates containing 500 μg of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of GST-14-3-3 bound to glutathione-Sepharose. The beads were washed two times with 1 ml of NHE1 lysis buffer, once with 1 ml of LiCl wash buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and two times more with 1 ml of lysis buffer before the addition of boiling Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western analysis. Anti-NHE1 antibody was obtained from Chemicon. Human NHE1 cDNA was a gift from Dr. L. Fliegel (University of Alberta, Canada). Serine 703 was mutated to alanine using polymerase chain reaction as described earlier (20Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G.

Briefly, sense and antisense primers were designed to contain the desired mutation, indicated below by the lowercase letters, and to anneal to the same sequence on opposite strands of the plasmid. The following sense primers were used (antisense primers were the identical sequence in reverse): CGCATCGGCTCAGACgCACTGGCCTATGAGCCG (NHE1 P705A), ACCAGGCAGCGGCTGCGGgCCTACAACAGACACACGCTG (NHE1 S648A), GTCATCACCATCGACCCGGCgTCCCCGCAGTCACCCGAGTC (NHE1 S723A), ACCCGGCTTCCCCGCAGgCACCCGAGTCTGTGGAC (NHE1 S726A), TCCCCGCAGTCACCCGAGgCTGTGGACCTGGTGAATG (NHE1 S729A), and TCTCTGTTGCCTACgAGAATGTGGTAGGTGC (14-3-3 K49Q). The primers were extended with Pfu polymerase, resulting at length in the generation of mutated plasmids containing the desired nicks, andDpnI was added to the final product to digest the parental DNA. After the correct sequence was confirmed, the cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA/3.1(+) (Invitrogen Inc.) to transfect mammalian cells or into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to express it as GST fusion protein. PS120 cells were seeded at 40% confluence onto 60-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfection and transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA using the LipofectAMINE Plus method (Qiagen). After 3 h of incubation with the DNA-lipid complexes, the cells were refed with serum-containing medium. Two days post-transfection, the transfected cells were trypsinized and seeded onto three 100-mm dishes in medium containing 1 mg/ml neomycin. After 1 week of selection, cell colonies were picked and expanded into individual cultures. Transfected PS120 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS with 1 mg/ml neomycin, and every 2 weeks cells were subjected to acid selection to maintain high level expression of NHE1 as described previously (20Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were exposed to 50 mmNH4Cl in TBSS (135 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mmMgCl2, 200 mg/dl glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) for 1 h followed by low NaCl/choline Cl solution buffer (130 mm choline Cl, 5 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 200 mg/dl glucose, 20 mmHEPES, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.5) for 1 h. GST-NHE1-(625–747) fusion protein was phosphorylated by p90 RSK2 in HMK buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 12 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl) at 37 °C overnight. One μg of GST-NHE1 was incubated with 40 μg of GST or 10 μg of GST-14-3-3 at 20 °C for 1 h, and then protein phosphatase 1α was added for 5–60 min. The phosphatase reaction was stopped by the addition of boiling Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation state was evaluated by autoradiography. Na+/H+ exchange was determined by ethyl isopropyl amiloride-sensitive pHi recovery following acid loading as described previously using the fluorescent pH-sensitive dye, acetoxymethyl ester of 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF-AM) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Fluorescent measurements (excitation at 490 and 450 nm with emission at 530 nm) were made with a PTI Delta scan spectrofluorometer. Briefly, cells were grown on glass coverslips and growth-arrested at 70–80% confluence by incubation in 0% FCS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h prior to use. Cells were loaded with 3 μm acetoxymethyl ester of BCECF-AM in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 30 min, washed twice, and incubated in a HEPES-Tris balanced salt solution (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mmMgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES buffered to pH 7.4 with Tris base) for 30 min. All experiments were then performed at 25 °C. Cells were acid-loaded by incubation with Tris-buffered salt solution (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES buffered with Tris base to pH 7.4) containing 20 mm NH4Cl, followed by Tris-buffered salt solution with 0 mm NH4Cl. Cell pH recovery was recorded over the next 10 min. Afterward, the nigericin/high K+ technique with 20 μm nigericin in KCl solution (130 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4–6.5) was used to calibrate the relationship between excitation ratio (F490/F450) and pHi. In serum stimulation experiments, 20% FCS was added to Tris-buffered salt solution and nigericin solutions. The rate of pHi recovery was converted to mmol of H+/min/liter of cells (JH) by multiplying by the buffering power. Buffering power was calculated from the change in cell pHiobserved upon NH4Cl addition. The data were then plotted as mmol of H+/min/liter of cells (JH)versus pHi. Values presented are means ± S.E. Student's t test or analysis of variance was used when appropriate. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. We have previously demonstrated that serum stimulates the phosphorylation of NHE1 at serine 703 (20Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This serine is contained within the sequence RIGSDP, which is similar to established recognition motifs of 14-3-3 proteins. To determine whether 14-3-3 binds to NHE1, we constructed three GST fusion proteins corresponding to amino acids 516–630, 625–747, or 748–815, together comprising the entire cytoplasmic tail of the exchanger (Fig.1). Using these GST fusion proteins in a far Western assay, we determined that 14-3-3 binds the region encompassing amino acids 625–747, whereas its association with the other two portions of the cytoplasmic tail or to GST alone was negligible (Fig. 1). Two additional GST fusion proteins spanning amino acids 625–670 or 625–714 were used to define the region that binds 14-3-3. Only GST-NHE1-(625–714) interacted with 14-3-3, indicating that 14-3-3 binds NHE1 between amino acids 670 and 714. Appropriately, this region contains serine 703 and our proposed 14-3-3 binding motif. It is well documented that serum and growth factors stimulate NHE1 activity and phosphorylation. To confirm that 14-3-3 associates with NHE1 in cells, we stimulated PS127 fibroblasts that overexpress NHE1 with 20% FCS and immunoprecipitated NHE1 from the cell lysates. Coprecipitation of 14-3-3 with NHE1 was enhanced in serum-stimulated cells, whereas NHE1 immunoprecipitation was equivalent in all conditions (Fig. 2 A). To compensate for variable quality of NHE1 antibody lots, we also verified 14-3-3 association with NHE1 using glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-14-3-3 in a pull-down assay. Binding of NHE1 to 14-3-3 was increased 5.2 ± 0.4-fold in cells stimulated for 5 min and remained elevated (3.9 ± 0.3-fold) after 40 min (Fig.2 B). In comparison, GST-Sepharose alone did not pull down the exchanger from serum-stimulated cells. We have found that serum stimulation of cells leads to phosphorylation of serine 703 and that this phosphorylation is greatly diminished in the presence of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. We investigated whether MEK1 inhibition also interferes with binding of 14-3-3 to NHE1. PS127 cells were incubated with PD98059 for 1 h prior to serum stimulation. Fig. 2 B confirms that 50 μmPD98059, shown to prevent agonist-stimulated ERK1/2 and RSK activation and Na+/H+ exchange (12Aharonovitz O. Granot Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16494-16499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol.

Res. 1998; 82: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), completely abolished serum-stimulated association of 14-3-3 with NHE1. 1 μm PD98059 had no effect (data not shown). Based on the findings that 14-3-3 binds a region spanning amino acids 670–714, containing serine 703, and that both association of 14-3-3 with NHE1 and phosphorylation of serine 703 in serum-stimulated cells is sensitive to PD98059, we sought to confirm that Ser(P)703lies within the 14-3-3 binding motif of NHE1. To establish that 14-3-3 binds NHE1 at serine 703, PS120 cells (which are deficient in NHE1) were stably transfected with the NHE1 S703A mutant described previously (20Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Serum stimulation failed to promote interaction of 14-3-3 with NHE1 S703A, as demonstrated by a pull-down assay (Fig.3). Hence, Ser703 plays a major role in the interaction between NHE1 and 14-3-3, and phosphorylation of this serine is likely to be a requirement for association of these two proteins. Some recent publications report that 14-3-3 binds to proteins within a motif bearing not only a phosphorylated serine but also a proline in the +2-position (24Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Based on those data, we postulated that mutating proline 705 to alanine would also prevent binding of 14-3-3 to the exchanger. Indeed, in PS120 cells stably transfected with NHE1 P705A, 14-3-3 could no longer pull down NHE1 despite serum stimulation (Fig.3). The specificity of the interaction of 14-3-3 with the motif encompassing Ser703 and Pro705 was further confirmed using stable transfectants of four other serine to alanine mutants of NHE1 in the same region of the cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 625–747) that we identified as potential kinase substrates. Fig.3 B illustrates that in cells stimulated with 20% serum for 5 min, the S648A, S723A, S726A, and S729A mutants of NHE1 were successfully pulled down by 14-3-3, unlike the S703A or P705A mutants, despite equivalent expression levels of all mutants in PS120 cells. Hence, our combined data prove that the RIGSDP sequence at amino acids 700–705 is the key motif for binding of 14-3-3 to NHE1 and that other neighboring serines are not necessary for this association. 14-3-3 primarily binds ligands via a phosphorylated serine. In the 14-3-3ζ isoform, several critical amino acids lying within its ligand binding groove that make contact with phosphoserine have been identified including lysine 49, which when mutated reduces the interaction of 14-3-3ζ with its binding partners Bcr, Raf (27Zhang C. Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13397-13402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and Cbl (28Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed a K49Q mutant of GST-14-3-3β and tested whether it would pull down NHE1 from serum-stimulated cells. As depicted in Fig.4, lysine 49 is essential for binding of 14-3-3 to NHE1, since replacement of this single amino acid abolished serum-stimulated association of 14-3-3 with NHE1. 14-3-3 proteins are known to bind to phosphoserine, and one of their key roles may be prevention of dephosphorylation of the serines by phosphatases such as PP1 and PP2. PP1 has been proposed to be a NHE1 phosphatase, based on findings that okadaic acid prevents dephosphorylation of NHE1 (29Sardet C. Fafournoux P. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19166-19171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the ability of 14-3-3 binding to protect the exchanger from dephosphorylation, we developed a biochemical assay in which GST-NHE1-(625–747) phosphorylated by RSK was exposed to PP1α for differing times in the presence of GST or GST-14-3-3. Dephosphorylation of GST-NHE1-(625–747) incubated with GST alone was marked within 5 min of PP1α addition and progressed steadily thereafter (to 65, 41, and 27% of initial phosphorylation at 15, 30, and 60 min, respectively; Fig. 5 A). In contrast, dephosphorylation of GST-NHE1-(625–747) was significantly slower when incubated with GST-14-3-3 before exposure to PP1α (89, 87, and 66%, respectively of initial phosphorylation at the same times;p < 0.05 compared with GST alone; Fig. 5 A). The protective effect of GST-14-3-3 was completely lost when incubated with the GST-NHE1 P705A mutant that cannot bind 14-3-3 (Fig.5 B). Similarly, the GST-14-3-3 K49Q mutant, which does not associate with NHE1, was unable to protect wild-type GST-NHE1 from dephosphorylation by PP1α more efficiently than GST alone (Fig.5 C). Hence, binding of 14-3-3 to NHE1 protects phosphoserine 703 from phosphatases and may contribute to maintaining the exchanger in a phosphorylated, active state. We have previously demonstrated that serine 703 plays a major role in NHE1 function, since mutation to alanine prevents serum-stimulated NHE1 activation (20Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that association of 14-3-3 with NHE1 contributes to activation of the exchanger by serum, since phosphorylation of serine 703 correlates with enhanced exchanger activity (20Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and binding of 14-3-3 to NHE1 maintains Ser(P)703 in a phosphorylated state. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated pHi recovery from acid loading in cells expressing wild type NHE1 or the NHE1 P705A mutant. Fig.6 A depicts typical pHirecovery curves of acid-loaded cells in the presence and absence of serum. PS120 cells stably expressing wild type NHE1 rapidly recovered pHi and reached pHi = 6.98 ± 0.09 by 150 s. Treatmen"
https://openalex.org/W1997160767,"An interaction between free fatty acids and UCP1 (uncoupling protein-1) leading to de-energization of mitochondria was assumed to be a key event for triggering heat production in brown fat. Recently, Matthiaset al., finding indistinguishable de-energization of isolated brown fat mitochondria by fatty acids in UCP1-deficient mice and control mice, challenged this assumption (Matthias, A., Jacobsson, A., Cannon, B., and Nedergaard, J. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 28150–28160). Since their results were obtained using UCP1-deficient and control mice on an undefined genetic background, we wanted to determine unambiguously the phenotype of UCP1 deficiency with the targeted Ucp1 allele on congenic C57BL/6J and 129/SvImJ backgrounds. UCP1-deficient congenic mice have a very pronounced cold-sensitive phenotype; however, deficient mice on the F1 hybrid background were resistant to cold. We propose that heterosis provides a mechanism to compensate for UCP1 deficiency. Contrary to the results of Matthias et al., we found a significant loss of fatty acid-induced de-energization, as reflected by membrane potential and oxygen consumption, in brown fat mitochondria from UCP1-deficient mice. Unlike cold sensitivity, fatty acid-induced uncoupling of mitochondria was independent of the genetic background of UCP1-deficient mice. We propose that intracellular free fatty acids directly regulate uncoupling activity of UCP1 in a manner consistent with models described in the literature.

We propose that intracellular free fatty acids directly regulate uncoupling activity of UCP1 in a manner consistent with models described in the literature. Brown adipose tissue (BAT)1 plays an important role in heat production and is considered to contribute to energy balance (5Smith R.E. Horwitz B.A. Physiol. Rev. 1969; 49: 330-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 6Rothwell N.J. Stock M.J. Nature. 1979; 281: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Stimulation by the sympathetic nervous system causes an up-regulation in the metabolic rate of BAT that is reflected in an increase of heat production (7Foster D.O. Frydman M.L. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1978; 56: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 8Foster D.O. Frydman M.L. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1979; 57: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The ability to generate heat is attributed to the high number of mitochondria containing UCP1 (uncoupling protein-1) (9Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). This transmembrane protein is thought to be an ion carrier that uncouples respiration from ATP synthesis, allowing mitochondria to produce heat. The importance of UCP1 for thermogenesis was proven by the observation that UCP1-deficient mice are cold-sensitive (10Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). However, the fact that some UCP1-deficient mice are resistant to cold and that adiposity is not increased led us to postulate that additional thermogenic mechanisms can compensate for UCP1 deficiency. In this respect, UCP1-deficient mice can help not only to understand the mechanisms that control BAT thermogenesis, but can also be used to identify alternative pathways for heat production. Although it is known that the sympathetic nervous system controls heat production of brown adipocytes (11Prusiner S.B. Cannon B. Ching T.M. Lindberg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 7: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Thomas S.A. Palmiter R.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the intracellular signaling pathway remains unclear. It has been proposed that free fatty acids (FFAs), released by the action of hormone-sensitive lipase, serve both as an energy substrate and as an activator of the proton carrier function of UCP1, thereby triggering heat production. It has also been shown that FFAs can increase respiration of isolated brown adipocytes (13Bukowiecki L.J. Follea N. Lupien J. Paradis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12840-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that isolated BAT mitochondria are more prone to de-energization by FFAs compared with liver mitochondria (14Wojtczak L. Schonfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Finally, experiments with reconstituted UCP1 in proteoliposomes (4Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with ectopic expression of UCP1 in yeast (15Gonzalez-Barroso M.M. Fleury C. Arechaga I. Zaragoza P. Levi-Meyrueis C. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 350-445Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) demonstrate that FFAs are necessary for UCP1 to act as a proton carrier. The model for the activation of UCP1 by FFAs has recently been challenged by Matthias et al. (1Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) by the analysis of the bioenergetics of isolated BAT mitochondria from UCP1-deficient mice. In agreement with the findings of Monemdjou et al. (16Monemdjou S. Kozak L.P. Harper M.-E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1073-E1082PubMed Google Scholar), Matthias et al. found a high mitochondrial membrane potential in UCP1-deficient mice that was independent of GDP addition. This confirmed that GDP inhibited UCP1-dependent proton flux. Matthias et al. also presented provocative findings that the ability of FFAs to uncouple BAT does not depend on UCP1. Their data suggested that wild-type and UCP1-deficient BAT mitochondria had the same ratio of de-energization after the addition of the same amounts of fatty acid. In a second study, Matthias et al.(17Matthias A. Ohlson K.B. Fredriksson J.M. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25073-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) showed that the stimulation of oxygen consumption by noradrenaline and fatty acid in isolated brown adipocytes depended on Ucp1expression. Matthias et al. concluded that the uncoupling effect of FFA is not directly mediated by UCP1; rather an alternative activator such as a metabolite of FFAs enhances the proton transport activity of UCP1. Considering the long history of biochemical studies pointing toward an interaction between UCP1 and FFAs in the activation of proton flux, we reevaluated UCP1-independent FFA uncoupling in UCP1-deficient mice that have defined genetic backgrounds. Our results show that FFA-induced uncoupling of respiration in isolated BAT mitochondria is strongly reduced in UCP1-deficient mice. The basis of the difference between our results and those of the Matthias et al. (1Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Matthias A. Ohlson K.B. Fredriksson J.M. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25073-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) is not clear since FFA-induced uncoupling is reduced in UCP1-deficient mice irrespective of the genetic background of the targeted mice. On the other hand, differences in genetic background are extremely important for thermoregulation in UCP1-deficient mice since targeted mice on congenic backgrounds are extremely sensitive to cold, whereas mice on a F1 hybrid background are resistant to cold. Clearly some, as yet to be identified, thermogenic mechanisms allow the latter mice to resist cold. Ucp tm1 knockout mice on a mixed 129/SvPas and C57BL/6J background were backcrossed to 129/SvImJ and C57BL/6J for 10 generations. At the 10th backcross generation, each line was typed with 135 microsatellite markers to establish its genetic purity. These mice were intercrossed to obtain mice homozygous for theUcp1 tm1 allele. The absence of Ucp1mRNA was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using a Taqman® probe. Littermates with two wild-type Ucp1 alleles were used as control mice. 129/SvImJ × C57BL/6J hybrid mice were obtained by crossing homozygous Ucp1 tm1 knockout mice from the two congenic lines. All mice were kept in a 12-h light cycle in 27 °C and fed a 4.5% fat chow diet. Animals of both genders between the ages of 8 and 12 weeks were used. Cold sensitivity was estimated using the Vital View Data Acquisition System® (Mini Mitter Co., Inc., Sunriver, OR). Temperature probes were implanted in the peritoneal cavity 1 week prior to the experiment. Mice were single-caged and exposed to 4 °C on ER-4000 receiver units. The body temperatures were monitored online with a sampling rate of 12/h. Cold exposure was maintained for 18 h, and all hypothermic mice reaching a body core temperature of <30 °C were removed from the cold environment. Mitochondria were isolated in a manner similar to that described by Cannon and Lindberg (18Cannon B. Lindberg O. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Each step was performed on ice or at 4 °C. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and interscapular BAT was removed. The fat pads were homogenized immediately in homogenization medium (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and 0.2 mm EGTA) in the presence of 0.5% BSA in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The suspension was centrifuged at 900 ×g for 10 min and filtered through a 100-μm nylon mesh filter. The mitochondrial pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 16 min and resuspended in homogenization medium with 0.1% albumin. The mitochondria were then centrifuged at 6000 × g and resuspended in high potassium medium (100 mm KCl, 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and 1 mm EGTA). Resuspension directly in respiration buffer (125 mm sucrose, 4 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Tris phosphate, 20 mm KCl, 0.1% BSA, 5 μm rotenone, and 6 μg/ml oligomycin) caused a higher fluorescent quench, but did not alter the final results. Mitochondrial protein content was determined by the Lowry method (35Lowry D.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the suspensions were kept on ice for no longer than 4 h for the experiments. Biochemical properties of mitochondria were characterized by determination of activities for mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (19Gardner R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and cytochrome c oxidase (20Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. Taanman J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). All measurements were performed at 37 °C with constant stirring. A Clark-type oxygen electrode from Hansatech was used for monitoring oxygen consumption. Mitochondria were incubated in respiration buffer at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml protein. Glycerol phosphate was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. The UCP1-mediated proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane was inhibited by the addition of GDP (1 mm final concentration). De-energization of mitochondria was achieved by the addition of FFA. A concentration of 1 nm FCCP was sufficient to disrupt the electrochemical gradient and to observe maximum mitochondrial respiration. Fluorescent quench of the cationic dye rhodamine 123 was used for estimation of protonmotive force (21Nedergaard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The measurements were performed under the same conditions as the oxygen measurements, except that 0.13 μm fluorescent dye was added. Fluorescence was monitored in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectrofluorometer. According to our spectral data, we chose wavelengths of 500 and 525 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The fluorescence quench was converted to membrane potential using the Nernst equation. The conversion was calibrated using different potassium concentrations of the incubation medium and generation of diffusion potential by the addition of 29 ng/ml valinomycin, a potassium ionophore. Liver mitochondria were treated identically to BAT mitochondria, except that succinate at 10 mm was used as a substrate. RNA was isolated using TRI®-Reagent and subjected to quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (23Koza R.A. Hohmann S.M. Guerra C. Rossmeisl M. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34486-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction primers and Taqman® probes were designed corresponding to cDNA sequences of Ucp1, Ucp2, and Ucp3(GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers U63419, AB012159, andAF032902, respectively). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. GDP anddl-glycerol 3-phosphate were ordered as Tris and di(monocyclohexylammonium) salts, respectively. Only charcoal-treated fatty acid-free BSA was used. Lauric acid was used as a Tris salt in water; all other fatty acids were dissolved in ethanol. UCP1-deficient mice are sensitive to cold, showing the pivotal function of UCP1 for thermogenesis (10Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). However, in our initial description of the mice, we reported that ∼15% of the individuals were resistant to cold, suggesting that variation in genetic background could alter cold sensitivity. To address this issue, we established UCP1-deficient mice on inbred 129/SvImJ and C57BL/6J backgrounds. Incipient mice developed normally with regard to growth and development. As listed in Table I for the 129/SvImJ background, UCP1-deficient mice showed an increased BAT depot weight, a comparable content of mitochondrial protein, decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity, and increased mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity compared with wild-type mice.Table IParameters of interscapular brown fat pad and isolated mitochondria in congenic 129/SvImJ miceGenotypeMouse weight1-aValues for male mice only.BAT weight1-aValues for male mice only.COXmGPDHgmgμm/min/mgμm/min/mgUcp1(+/+) 129/SvImJ23.0 ± 1.553 ± 76.3 ± 0.62.4 ± 0.6Ucp1(−/−) 129/SvImJ22.5 ± 1.087 ± 131-bp < 0.01 compared with wild-type mitochondria.4.7 ± 0.71-bp < 0.01 compared with wild-type mitochondria.3.6 ± 1.41-bp < 0.01 compared with wild-type mitochondria.Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” specific activities are expressed per milligram of protein. n ≥ 14, animals of both genders and age of 65 ± 5 days.

Values are expressed as means ± S.D. Profound differences in sensitivity to cold were observed as the offspring approached the 10th backcross generation. To keep homozygous postnatal mice alive, the breeding room temperature was increased to 27 °C. In adult mice, the ability to produce heat under cold stress was characterized with cold sensitivity tests. Fig.1 shows the traces of body temperature of mice during cold exposure. 129/SvImJ and C57BL/6J wild-type mice could maintain their body temperature in an environment at 4 °C for an indefinite time (Fig. 1 A). UCP1-deficient mice congenic on 129/SvImJ and C57BL/6J backgrounds lost body core temperature rapidly (Fig. 1, B and C). The average rate of temperature loss of 4.9° and 3.9°/h was similar for both backgrounds. We also analyzed UCP1-deficient mice on a (129/SvImJ × C57BL/6J) F1 hybrid background (Fig. 1 D). These hybrid mice were generated by out-crossing parental lines ofUcp1−/− mice. Remarkably, these mice were resistant to cold, despite the absence of UCP1. We observed also that ∼1 out of 10 mice of the cold-resistant groups lost body temperature (Fig. 1,A and D). It is not unexpected to occasionally find a cold-sensitive mouse in a cold-resistant group since anything that affects the health of a mouse impairs cold resistance. It is quite possible that the surgery to implant temperature probes affected the health of the mice. FFAs, released by the action of hormone-sensitive lipase, play a key role in thermogenesis as an energy substrate for mitochondrial β-oxidation. Additionally, they are also thought to stimulate respiration by direct activation of UCP1. To establish the validity of this interaction, we investigated the ability of fatty acids to de-energize BAT mitochondria, as evidenced by mitochondrial membrane potential. UCP1-deficient mice and control mice on different genetic backgrounds were kept at 27 °C prior to dissection, and the protonmotive force of isolated BAT mitochondria was measured. Fig.2 shows representative traces for wild-type (A, C, and E) and UCP1-deficient (B, D, and F) mitochondria on 129/SvImJ (A and B), C57BL/6J (C and D), and F1 hybrid (E andF) backgrounds. As expected, BAT mitochondria in the control mice showed very little increase in protonmotive force after the addition of substrate, but a large increase after purine nucleotide addition (Fig. 2 A, C, and E). As previously shown (1Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Monemdjou S. Kozak L.P. Harper M.-E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1073-E1082PubMed Google Scholar), mitochondria in the mutant mice became maximally charged following the addition of substrate only (Fig. 2,B, D, and F) and showed no further increase upon the addition of 1 mm GDP. After achievement of maximum protonmotive force, BAT mitochondria were subjected to de-energization by stepwise addition of FFA. The final concentrations of lauric acid were 33, 67, and 100 μm. In this phase, UCP1-deficient mitochondria (Fig. 2, B, D, andF) were substantially less responsive to the addition of the same amount of FFA compared with BAT mitochondria in control mice (A, C, and E). The last step of each experiment was always the total de-energization with FCCP, a nonspecific uncoupler. Overall, the traces in Fig. 2 show an impaired fatty acid-induced de-energization in UCP1-deficient BAT mitochondria that is independent of the genetic background. The quantitative effects of fatty acids on membrane potential were determined using mitochondria from mice on a 129/SvImJ background. The experiments were carried out as described above, and de-energization was expressed in millivolts. Fig. 3 shows dose-response curves for linoleic acid in control BAT mitochondria and UCP1-deficient mitochondria from BAT and liver. The concentration of unbound linoleic acid in the presence of 0.1% BSA was calculated according to Richieri et al. (24Richieri G.V. Anel A. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7574-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Values were fitted by graphs similar to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and initial de-energization rates were estimated. The de-energization in UCP1-deficient BAT mitochondria was 35% of that in wild-type BAT mitochondria. For comparison, liver mitochondria with 0.6 mV/nm are still less prone to de-energization compared with UCP1-deficient BAT mitochondria with 1.6 mV/nm. The abilities of lauric, linoleic, and stearic acids to de-energize mitochondria are summarized in Table II. All measurements were carried out in the presence of 0.1% BSA; therefore, the concentrations of unbound fatty acids are much lower than the nominal concentrations. Because correction coefficients for calculating the concentration of unbound molecules are not known for some fatty acids, the nominal concentrations are presented. As already shown by Matthias et al. (1Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the maximum membrane potential was slightly increased in UCP1-deficient mitochondria. Contradictory to the findings of this group, we observed that with a nominal concentration of 66 μm lauric acid, a 36% reduction in membrane potential occurred in wild-type mice, compared with a 16% reduction in UCP1-deficient mice. The ability of linoleic and stearic acids to de-energize was also reduced in UCP1-deficient BAT mitochondria. We measured reductions from 30 to 14% and from 31 to 15% for the 27 μm nominal concentration of linoleic and stearic acids, respectively.Table IIProton-motive force and de-energization by fatty acids in BAT mitochondria from Ucp1 knockout mice and control miceGenotypeΔpDe-energizationLauric acid (66 μm)Linoleic acid (27 μm)Stearic acid (27 μm)mV%Ucp1(+/+)−145 ± 1736 ± 532 ± 634 ± 8Ucp1(−/−)−161 ± 1015 ± 62-ap < 0.001 compared with wild-type mitochondria.12 ± 32-ap < 0.001 compared with wild-type mitochondria.13 ± 72-ap < 0.001 compared with wild-type mitochondria.The experiments were performed as described for Fig. 2 for both genotypes in the presence of 1 mm GDP.

Concentrations of FFA are given as nominal concentrations in the presence of 0.1% BSA. n ≥ 9, animals of both genders and age of 65 ± 5 days. Values are expressed as means ± S.D. An alternative strategy for showing the importance of UCP1 for fatty acid-induced de-energization of isolated BAT mitochondria is based on the fact that long-term cold exposure increases UCP1 in BAT mitochondria (25Ricquier D. Mory G. Bouillaud F. Thibault J. Weissenbach J. FEBS Lett. 1984; 178: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Jacobsson A. Stadler U. Glotzer M.A. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16250-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we exposed normal mice to 4 °C for 1 week and performed the same de-energization experiments as described above. BAT mitochondria from cold-exposed mice showed 39 ± 3% de-energization after the addition of 66 μm lauric acid versus 25 ± 6% in control mice at 27 °C, indicating a positive correlation between higher content of UCP1 and fatty acid-induced de-energization. The key step in heat production of BAT is the activation of energy expenditure by uncoupling the respiration from ATP synthesis by UCP1. Respiratory studies were carried out to determine whether impaired de-energization in UCP1-deficient mitochondria leads to impaired activation of respiration. Fig. 4 (A andB) shows representative traces for oxygen consumption in BAT mitochondria. The BAT mitochondria from control mice reduced oxygen consumption after the addition of 1 mm GDP, whereas respiration of UCP1-deficient mitochondria was not affected by GDP. After the addition of 20 μm linoleic acid, the coupled mitochondria from control mice showed a 20% increase in oxygen consumption (Fig. 4 A) compared with UCP1-deficient mitochondria, whose respiration remained unaffected upon the addition of the same amount of fatty acid (Fig. 4 B). Maximum respiration was achieved by the addition of 2 μm FCCP. To show quantitative effects on fatty acid-stimulated respiration, we performed dose-response experiments. We coupled BAT mitochondria with 1 mm GDP and monitored oxygen consumption after the addition of varying amounts of lauric acid. These results are summarized in Fig.4 C. The nominal concentration of fatty acid that caused an increase in respiration was between 25 and 50 μm for wild-type mitochondria and between 75 and 100 μm for UCP1-deficient mitochondria. Our finding that fatty acid-induced de-energization of isolated BAT mitochondria is affected by UCP1 deficiency is contrary to the findings of Matthias et al.(1Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The only known variable that might account for the differences between our results and those of Matthias et al. is the genetic background of these mice. The cold resistance of UCP1-deficient mice on a hybrid background compared with cold sensitivity on inbred backgrounds suggests the existence of an alternative thermogenic mechanism induced in hybrid mice. To determine if this thermogenic pathway is mediated by the UCP1 homologs UCP2 and UCP3, we performed expression analysis at the mRNA level. Consistent with previous reports (1Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), the Ucp2 mRNA levels in BAT from UCP1-deficient mice were elevated over the controls (Fig.5 A). However, the degree ofUcp2 overexpression varied between 250% for the C57BL/6J genetic background and 600% for the 129/SvImJ genetic background.Ucp2 mRNA levels in cold-resistant F1 progeny were intermediate with respect to the parental strains, suggesting that variation in Ucp2 mRNA levels may be co-dominantly inherited. There were no differences in Ucp3 expression levels compared with control mice. Knowing that Ucp3 is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle and has a thermogenic potential (27Clapham J.C. Arch J.R. Chapman H. Haynes A. Lister C. Moore G.B. Piercy V. Carter S.A. Lehner I. Smith S.A. Beeley L.J. Godden R.J. Herrity N. Skehel M. Changani K.K. Hockings P.D. Reid D.G. Squires S.M. Hatcher J. Trail B. Latcham J. Rastan S. Harper A.J. Cadenas S. Buckingham J.A. Brand M.D. Nature. 2000; 406: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), we also analyzed skeletal muscle. Differences in Ucp2and Ucp3 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle cannot account for cold resistance of F1 hybrid Ucp1knockout mice (Fig. 5 B). Determining the interrelationships between thermogenesis, energy expenditure, and body weight regulation, particularly with respect to energy reserves, has both fundamental and practical importance in mammalian biology. However, progress in understanding how thermogenesis can be manipulated to affect energy expenditure and body weight has been slow since the number of potential mechanisms that can produce heat is very large. UCP1-dependent non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue is a well defined mechanism that can be up-regulated pharmacologically, and several genetically altered mouse models provide experimental systems to evaluate its role in the regulation of body weight. Transgenic mice in which Ucp1 is overexpressed have consistently provided strong evidence that elevated UCP1 can reduce excess adiposity. However, paradoxically, there is no evidence to suggest that the absence of UCP1 will produce the opposite phenotype, i.e. increased adiposity. Other phenotypes of mice carrying the targeted inactivation of Ucp1 need explanation. In our original publication (10Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), we also reported that 15% of the homozygous targeted mice were resistant to cold exposure. How is it that occasionally mice homozygous for the inactive allele are resistant to cold? Subsequently, Matthias et al.(1Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) obtained data showing that mitochondria isolated from targeted Ucp1 mice are uncoupled by FFAs to the same degree as mitochondria from wild-type mice, suggesting that FFAs do not directly activate UCP1-dependent proton flux. Since these effects of the mutation on body weight gain and thermosensitivity and the effects of FFAs were contrary to our expectations, we established the Ucp1 mutation on congenic backgrounds to eliminate uncontrolled genetic variability as a confounding factor. Experiments on thermosensitivity and FFA activation of UCP1 have been described here; the effects of the targeted Ucp1 mutation on body weight gain is under investigation. Cold sensitivity is a complex phenotype that was linked to metabolic disorders some 40 years ago with the measurement of body temperature in genetically obese (ob/ob) mice during cold exposure (28Davies T.R.A. Mayer J. Am. J. Physiol. 1954; 177: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Trayhurn P. Thurlby P.L. James W.P.T. Nature. 1977; 266: 60-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Since then, mouse models lacking key proteins for non-shivering thermogenesis have been established, but not all of them proved to be cold-sensitive. Mice lacking the β3-adrenergic receptor, which has been postulated to be essential for the differentiation of the brown adipocyte (30Zhao J. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R2002-R2011PubMed Google Scholar), can be exposed to 4 °C without symptoms of hypothermia, apparently through compensation by β1-adrenergic receptors (31Susulic V.S. Frederich R.C. Lawitts J. Tozzo E. Kahn B.B. Harper M.-E. Himms-Hagen J. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). More relevant with respect to the UCP1-deficient mice are the dopamine β-hydroxylase-deficient mice that are unable to synthesize norepinephrine (12Thomas S.A. Palmiter R.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Even though these mice are on an undefined genetic background, they are even more sensitive to cold compared with UCP1-deficient mice, and there is no evidence that any of the mutant animals are resistant to cold. The fact that these mice have low levels of Ucp1 mRNA suggests that the extreme sensitivity to cold is based on the impairment of mechanisms of thermogenesis in brown adipocytes besides UCP1 levels. Certainly the ability of these dopamine β-hydroxylase-deficient mice to generate fatty acids for β-oxidation from the triglyceride pools has been strongly reduced, as evidenced by the accumulation of lipid in the cytoplasm of the brown adipocytes. Other processes, including the stimulation of blood flow through the tissue, must be reduced in the absence of norepinephrine. We have shown that UCP1-deficient mice are cold-sensitive on both 129/SvImJ and C57BL/6J backgrounds, but not on the (129/SvImJ × C57BL/6J) F1 hybrid background. The resistance to cold in the hybrid animal cannot be explained by the characteristics of its mitochondrial physiology, at least within the limits of the experiments on membrane potentials and respiration and activation by FFAs. The results with inbred and hybrid UCP1-deficient mice are indistinguishable. In addition, there are no differences in expression levels ofUcp2and Ucp3in BAT or skeletal muscle that would suggest that hybrid mice are resistant to cold due to elevated expression of these genes. In addition to the resistance to cold found in the hybrid mice, UCP1-deficient mice on an inbred background can be adapted to tolerate cold by gradually reducing the ambient temperature; however, the acquisition of this property is variable. 2W. E. Hofmann, X. Liu, C. M. Bearden, M.-E. Harper, and L. P. Kozak, unpublished observation. We interpret these results to suggest that the cold sensitivity phenotype is very sensitive to the environment and that alternative thermogenic mechanisms can be induced to compensate for UCP1-based thermogenesis. The adaptation of C57BL/6J and 129/SvImJ mice to cold exposure or the constitutive resistance in hybrid mice can provide a biological system to identify alternative mechanisms of thermogenesis. The cold resistance of UCP1-deficient mice on a hybrid background is a dramatic example of heterosis or hybrid vigor. Heterosis has been extensively studied in plants with respect to growth; it has also been studied in mammals for complex phenotypes like behavioral traits (32Comings D.E. MacMurray J.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This might also account for cold resistance of UCP1-deficient mice on a F1 hybrid background as well. One of the more relevant examples of heterosis comes from a study of hybrids of four parental lines of chicken in which positive heterosis was observed for norepinephrine levels in the hypothalamus in a line-specific manner (33Barbato G.F. Kruzelock R.P. Behav. Genet. 1992; 22: 381-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In these same hybrids, heterosis was found for dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the optic tectum only. These results suggest that heterosis can affect the level of hormones that are relevant to thermogenesis. At the gene level, mice heterozygous for the inactive allele for α-calcium/calmodulin kinase II gene show much more defensive aggression than either the homozygous wild-type or mutant mice (34Chen C. Rainnie D.G. Greene R.W. Tonegawa S. Science. 1994; 266: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). An explanation of the mechanisms for these effects is not known, but it is clear that heterosis is not an uncommon phenomenon. Despite the fact that heterosis is poorly understood, hybrid effects may explain the cold resistance of some UCP1-deficient mice on a mixed undefined background in our original study (10Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Using UCP1-deficient mice on 129/SvImJ, C57BL/6J, and F1 hybrid backgrounds, we observed a significant reduction of fatty acid-induced de-energization of BAT mitochondria compared with control mice. This indicates that FFAs directly activate the uncoupling activity of UCP1 in BAT mitochondria. However, UCP1-deficient BAT mitochondria are still more prone to fatty acid-induced de-energization compared with liver mitochondria. This indicates that despite similar protonmotive force, UCP1-deficient BAT mitochondria and liver mitochondria are not similar, as already shown by the lack of ATP synthase activity in the former (1Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It also suggests that UCP1-deficient mitochondria retain a significant capacity to generate a membrane potential that can be uncoupled by fatty acids. It is uncertain whether this residual uncoupling contributes to heat production. Our finding that fatty acids have a reduced ability to de-energize BAT mitochondria in the absence of UCP1 irrespective of the genetic background of the mice does not agree with the findings of Matthiaset al. (1Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). They showed no impaired fatty acid-induced de-energization of UCP1-deficient BAT mitochondria compared with control mice. However, inspection of their data generated from UCP1-deficient mice on an undefined genetic background shows a trend toward UCP1 dependence. The uncoupling activity for seven fatty acids (as shown in Table III of Ref. 1Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) indicates that the uncoupling activity for each fatty acid is slightly decreased in UCP1-deficient BAT mitochondria. Considering all seven fatty acids together, an average value of 1.03 mV/μm can be calculated for wild-type mice versus 0.67 mV/μm FFA in UCP1-deficient mice. It should be emphasized that their data were expressed as millivolts/nominal FFA concentration in the presence of 0.1% BSA. Due to the exponential relationship between nominal and free (unbound) concentrations of fatty acids in the presence of BSA, the differences, expressed as millivolts/unbound FFA, would be more remarkable. However, using mice on an undefined background, their analysis did not show statistically significant differences. The reason why the impairment of fatty acid-induced de-energization by UCP1 deficiency is more significant in a mouse on a congenic background (our mice) is presently unknown. We conclude that, as previously postulated from biochemical studies, FFAs are vital physiological activators of UCP1-mediated uncoupling of respiration by the stimulation of proton flux. There are two models describing how FFAs interact with UCP1 to uncouple respiration. According to Winkler and Klingenberg (4Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), FFAs provide carboxyl groups for transporting protons together with amino acid carboxyl groups in the transmembrane channel of UCP1. In the second model, the function of UCP1 is indirect (2Jezek P. Drahota Z. Ring K. J. Lipid Mediators. 1990; 2: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar, 3Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). This model proposes that neutral FFAs can pass the inner mitochondrial membrane transporting protons. After deprotonation in the matrix, UCP1 transports the carboxylate anions back across the membrane, which completes the fatty acid cycle of proton shuttling. Although our experiments do not provide any insight as to which model is correct, they do show that BAT mitochondria from UCP1-deficient mice have an impaired fatty acid-induced de-energization. We suggest that the interaction of FFAs and UCP1 enables changes in the intercellular concentration of FFA to regulate the uncoupling activity of UCP1. It is also evident from our results on heterosis that the absence of a UCP1-based thermogenesis does not preclude the emergence of alternative mechanisms of thermogenesis to protect mice from cold exposure.

https://openalex.org/W2016362105,"After phosphorylation by protein kinase A, gating of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is regulated by the interaction of ATP with its nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Models of this gating regulation have proposed that ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 and NBD2 may drive channel opening and closing, respectively (reviewed in Nagel, G. (1999)Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1461, 263–274). However, as yet there has been little biochemical confirmation of the predictions of these models. We have employed photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-ATP, which supports channel gating as effectively as ATP to evaluate interactions with each NBD in intact membrane-bound CFTR. Mutagenesis of Walker A lysine residues crucial for azido-ATP hydrolysis to generate the azido-ADP that is trapped by vanadate indicated a greater role of NBD1 than NBD2. Separation of the domains by limited trypsin digestion and enrichment by immunoprecipitation confirmed greater and more stable nucleotide trapping at NBD1. This asymmetry of the two domains in interactions with nucleotides was reflected most emphatically in the response to the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), which in the gating models was proposed to bind with high affinity to NBD2 causing inhibition of ATP hydrolysis there postulated to drive channel closing. Instead we found a strong competitive inhibition of nucleotide hydrolysis and trapping at NBD1 and a simultaneous enhancement at NBD2. This argues strongly that AMP-PNP does not inhibit ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 and thereby questions the relevance of hydrolysis at that domain to channel closing.

This argues strongly that AMP-PNP does not inhibit ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 and thereby questions the relevance of hydrolysis at that domain to channel closing. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 has two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) that are believed in some manner to regulate permeation of chloride ions (1Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Whereas the two NBDs of another ABC protein, the P-glycoprotein multidrug transporter, are highly homologous and believed to be functionally equivalent (2Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25031-25038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the domains in members of the ABCC subfamily to which CFTR belongs show less sequence similarity (3Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). This asymmetry is reflected functionally in two members of this subfamily, SUR1 (4Ueda K.

Both ATP and ADP act on SUR1 to regulate the Kir6.2 potassium channel; ATP is bound at NBD1 and also bound and hydrolyzed at NBD2, and the ADP produced stabilizing ATP binding to NBD1 (9Ueda K. Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Morita K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly in the case of MRP1, which transports conjugated anions, ATP binding was detected exclusively at NBD1 and was enhanced allosterically by the trapping of ADP produced by hydrolysis at NBD2 (6Hou Y.-X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Schemes of ATP binding and hydrolysis by CFTR have been proposed solely on the basis of channel-gating responses (10Hwang T.-C. Baukrowitz G. Nagel G. Horie A.C. Gadsby D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4698-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 11Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Implicit in these models is the idea that channel opening is driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis at one NBD and closing at the other (13Nagel G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Intact CFTR (14Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) hydrolyze ATP. It has been reported also that photoaffinity labeling of CFTR by 8-azido-ATP at NBD1 occurred in the absence of orthovanadate, whereas NBD2 labeling required its presence (17Szabo K. Szakacs G. Hegeds T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here we show that 8-azido-ATP, which supports CFTR channel activity as well as ATP, labels both NBDs in a vanadate-stimulatable manner indicating that hydrolysis and trapping occurs at both domains. Furthermore, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP, which has been relied upon heavily in the formulation of models of the action of the NBDs in gating (18Baukrowitz T. Hwang T.C. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 473-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Mathews C.J. Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond ). 1998; 508: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was found to have entirely opposite effects on the two domains. Strong competitive inhibition of nucleotide trapping at NBD1 without prevention of channel opening (1Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) makes it unlikely that hydrolysis at NBD1 drives channel opening. Similarly stimulation rather than inhibition of trapping at NBD2 does not support the idea that AMP-PNP prevents channel closing by inhibition of hydrolysis there. BHK-21 cells stably expressing wild-type human CFTR were prepared and maintained as described previously (20Chang X.-B. Tabcharani J.A. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Kartner N. Alon N. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11304-11311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as were cells expressing the K464A and K1250A mutants. The mouse monoclonal antibodies, L12B4 and M3A7, used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, were those described by Kartner et al. (21Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The antibody MM13-4 recognizes an epitope between residues 24 and 35. 2L. Aleksandrov, A. Mengos, X. Chang, A. Aleksandrov, and J. R. Riordan, unpublished results. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN Biomedicals. AMP-PNP and other nucleotides and TPCK-treated trypsin were from Sigma as were all protease inhibitors except Pefabloc, which was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 8-Azido-AMP-PNP was synthesized by Affinity Labeling Technologies, Inc. CFTR-expressing BHK cells were homogenized in an ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (μg/ml), E64 (3.5 μg/ml), and benzamidine (120 μg/ml). Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 600 ×g. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g and then resuspended in 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA. The photoactivable radionucleotide at the concentration indicated in each experiment was incubated with the resuspended membranes (15–30 μg of protein for direct analysis by SDS-PAGE and 150–200 μg of protein for immunoprecipitation) for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of sodium orthovanadate (0.5 mm). After transfer to ice the membrane suspension was irradiated for 2 min in a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (λ = 254 nm) either before or after pelleting to wash out unbound 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and resuspension in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mmEGTA. The membranes then were solubilized directly in gel loading buffer for SDS-PAGE or digested with trypsin prior to immunoprecipitation. Photoaffinity-labeled membranes were incubated with TPCK-treated trypsin for 15 min on ice at an enzyme to membrane protein mass ratio of 1:180. Digestion was terminated with excess soybean inhibitor, and membranes were solubilized in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl) and immunoprecipitated with either of the monoclonal antibodies L12B4 or M3A7 (21Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for standard (x-ray film) and electronic (Packard Instant Imager) autoradiography. A previous study showed photolabeling of CFTR expressed in insect Sf9 cells with 8-azido-ATP (17Szabo K. Szakacs G. Hegeds T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, Aand B, shows that CFTR in mammalian cell (BHK) membranes is photolabeled by 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in a vanadate-stimulatable manner and that no labeling occurs in the absence of UV irradiation. Fig. 1 C shows that unlabeled N3ATP competes for photolabeling by N3[α-32P]ATP much more effectively than ATP suggesting that there is higher affinity for the derivatized nucleotide than for ATP. We also find that N3ATP is more effective on a dose basis than ATP in supporting CFTR single-channel gating (data not shown). This may be a common feature of ABCC subfamily members, because N3ATP also supports organic anion transport by MRP1 more effectively than ATP (6Hou Y.-X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This provides assurance that 8-azido-ATP is a functionally relevant probe of nucleotide interactions with these proteins. In P-glycoprotein (2Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25031-25038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and MRP1 (6Hou Y.-X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) mutagenesis of the Walker A lysine residues in either NBD1 or NBD2 prevents ATP hydrolysis and hence trapping of 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP. Because neither CFTR channel gating (22Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) nor hydrolysis of ATP (23Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Garami E. Huan L.J. Galley K. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) is prevented completely by substitution of these residues, it was of interest to determine their effect on photolabeling. Fig. 2 A shows that labeling of the NBD2 mutant (K1250A) is reduced only a small amount compared with wild type indicating that normally there may be little hydrolysis and trapping at NBD2. In contrast the comparable substitution in NBD1 (K464A) greatly diminished labeling compared with wild type indicating that the majority of labeling and trapping may occur at NBD1. However, the effects of this mutation have to be considered in light of the fact that it also interferes with biosynthetic maturation of the protein as is reflected in the much lower ratio of the larger mature band to the smaller immature band in the Western blot shown below the autoradiogram. Nevertheless the amount of labeling is reduced substantially relative to the amount of mature protein present. As an additional indirect means of assessing the role of the two NBDs in the photolabeling of the whole protein the influence of the binding of different monoclonal antibodies was measured. L12B4, which binds near the N terminus of NBD1 (21Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), reduced labeling to a very low level again suggesting that much of the labeling occurred at NBD1. There was a lesser reduction of labeling by M3A7 that binds near the C terminus of NBD2. A third antibody, MM13-4, binding away from the NBDs near the N terminus of CFTR had no effect on photolabeling. To assess hydrolysis and trapping at each of the NBDs more directly, membranes were treated with trypsin to cleave between the domains. After detergent solubilization the same two antibodies employed above were then used to immunoprecipitate polypeptide fragments containing each domain. It was first necessary to identify these fragments by immunoblotting after their separation by SDS-PAGE. These results are shown in Fig.3 A. The L12B4 antibody detected undigested CFTR at the top of the gel, a tight set of bands in the 70–80 kDa range, and a band at ∼40 kDa. The same procedure using the M3A7 antibody detected in addition to undigested CFTR a strong band at 95–105 kDa that is actually a doublet and a set of bands in the 30–35 kDa range. The large fragments detected by each antibody reflect trypsin cleavage(s) in the R-domain (Fig. 2 C). The sites responsible for the 40-kDa band detected by L12B4 are not clearly established. Digestion near the N terminus of NBD2 is responsible for the 30–35 kDa bands detected by M3A7. The assignment of the bands was confirmed by additional antibodies recognizing epitopes within NBD1 and NBD2 (data not shown). When immunoprecipitations were carried out after digestion to enrich the NBD-containing fragments, the results shown in Fig. 3 Bwere obtained. These blots confirmed that the L12B4 antibody has immunoprecipitated the NBD1-assigned fragments, and the M3A7 antibody has immunoprecipitated the NBD2 fragments (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2 and 3). However, unexpectedly this experiment also showed that the large fragments containing the two NBDs remained strongly associated after trypsin digestion. That is, probing the NBD2 immunoprecipitate with antibody to NBD1 revealed the presence of the large NBD1 bands (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). Similarly probing the NBD1 immunoprecipitate with antibody to NBD2 detected the lower member of the large NBD2 doublet (Fig.3 A, lane 4). These immunoprecipitations were done in RIPA buffer with its multiple detergents, but even when the trypsin digests were incubated in 2% SDS prior to dilution to RIPA conditions these same co-immunoprecipitations occurred. These data do not absolutely prove that the strong interaction between these fragments are exclusively between the NBDs, because the large NBD2-containing fragment also contains all of the second membrane-associated domain and part of the R-domain. Other studies with the domains expressed separately have found interactions between NBD1 and NBD2 (24Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. DeBerg L.G. Welsh M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but the observations reported here are the first suggesting that the strong binding occurs in the intact functional protein. This is not crucial to the main point of this paper, which is to demonstrate the asymmetry of nucleotide interactions at the two NBDs and their relevance to channel regulation, but it will be important in more detailed future studies of the mechanism. The positions of the reduced immunoglobulin bands present in the immunoprecipitates are shown in Fig. 3 C and account for the bands of these mobilities in Fig. 3 B. Immunoprecipitation with M3A7 was employed to detect fragments labeled with N3[α-32P]ATP. Fig.4 A reveals that both domains are labeled, but there is more labeling of NBD1 than NBD2. In this experiment the free 8-azido-ATP incubated with membranes was not removed prior to photoactivation. When the nucleotides were washed out before irradiation labeling of NBD1 was not altered, but labeling at NBD2 was reduced greatly (Fig. 4 B). This was evident particularly in the large decrease in intensity of the small NBD2 bands but was seen also in the large NBD2 bands. This result suggests there may be lesser affinity for the nucleotide at NBD2 than at NBD1. This is substantiated by the concentration dependence shown in Fig.4 C, which also indicates saturation of labeling at NBD1 at a lower 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP than at NBD2. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, has been used extensively in attempts to determine the role of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in CFTR channel gating (1Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 25Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Its ability when present together with ATP to lock the channel open has been attributed to its suggested binding to NBD2 and prevention of hydrolysis there proposed to be necessary for channel closing (13Nagel G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Incubation of increasing concentrations of AMP-PNP together with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP prior to photoactivation strongly inhibited labeling at NBD1 but not at NBD2 (Fig.5 A). In fact there was increased labeling of the NBD2 bands at the lower AMP-PNP concentrations. In contrast to the differential effects of AMP-PNP, other nucleotides including ATP, ADP, and dATP competed for labeling at either domain approximately equally (Fig. 5 B). dATP was more potent than ATP and ADP, consistent with other observations in which the deoxynucleotide had a lower Km for hydrolysis by CFTR and a strong influence on channel gating (data not shown). However, the opposite effects of AMP-PNP on NBD1 and NBD2 were most striking, because it is the only compound we have found yet to influence the two domains differentially. This observation is important, because it is the first direct test of AMP-PNP interactions predicted on the basis of the its locking-open of the channel in the presence of ATP (18Baukrowitz T. Hwang T.C. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 473-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The enhancement of nucleotide trapping at NBD2 would not seem to be in agreement with the predicted inhibition of hydrolysis there. The pronounced reduction in trapping at NBD1 could reflect an inhibition of hydrolysis at that domain. To explore these reciprocal effects of AMP-PNP further we had the compound 8-azido-AMP-PNP synthesized. Because 8-azido-ATP was far more effective than ATP in competing for photolabeling by 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (Fig. 1 C) we reasoned that 8-azido-AMP-PNP also might have a more potent influence than AMP-PNP on the interactions of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. Fig.6 shows that this was indeed the case. Qualitatively, the effect was the same as that of AMP-PNP,i.e. there was inhibition of labeling at NBD1 and enhancement of that at NBD2. Quantitatively however these effects occurred at nearly 10-fold lower concentrations and were more clear-cut. The data points relating labeling at NBD1 and 8-azido-AMP-PNP concentration (Fig. 6 B) fit very well with a strictly competitive inhibition curve with a Ki in the range of 1–2 μm. The curve for labeling at NBD2 is almost the mirror image of that at NBD1 at concentrations up to 100 μm. The basis of this effect cannot be interpreted so readily, but it may reflect an indirect consequence of the high affinity interaction at NBD1. At concentrations between 100 μm and 1 mm this effect is overcome probably by direct competition for binding to the lower affinity site on NBD2. The advantage gained by utilization of two rather than one NBD by ABC proteins is not obvious. In the case of CFTR, which is unique among these molecules as an ion channel, a possible correspondence of this duality with the two discrete steps in channel gating, i.e.opening and closing, is an attractive idea. Indeed this concept has been central in prevalent models of CFTR channel gating (25Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possible separation of function between the domains, nucleotide interactions at the NBDs of other ABCC family proteins are markedly asymmetric (6Hou Y.-X. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1461: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As we show here this also seems to be the case for CFTR, i.e. ATP binding and ADP trapping is tighter at NBD1 than NBD2, and AMP-PNP has opposite effects on the two domains. This latter observation is significant, because studies of the effect of AMP-PNP on CFTR channel gating in the presence of ATP have been interpreted on the basis of the assumption that it binds with high affinity to NBD2 (1Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). By so doing the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide was proposed to maintain the channel in an open state until it slowly dissociated (18Baukrowitz T. Hwang T.C. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 473-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Explicit in this proposal was the idea that the hydrolysis of ATP at this site would normally be necessary for channel closing. Our present observations show that AMP-PNP competes for nucleotide trapping at NBD1 and at the same time enhances the interaction at NBD2 probably as an allosteric response to the higher affinity binding at NBD1. The fact that the two domains seem firmly associated in the intact protein supports the feasibility of such allosteric interactions. In this regard it is significant that major conformational changes have been observed in P-glycoprotein on binding AMP-PNP (26Julien M. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4559-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although most of the attention has been paid to the locking-open effect of AMP-PNP (1Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 13Nagel G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) Weinreich et al. (27Weinreich F. Riordan J.R. Nagel G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) more recently have shown that it also slows channel opening. On this basis these authors suggested that there may be two binding sites for AMP-PNP on CFTR. Our data also indicate that the compound has two different types of impact on the protein. It should be noted also that the CFTR channel can be gated in the absence of ATP by high concentrations of AMP-PNP alone (28Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X. Aleksandrov L. Riordan J.R. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 528: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, this requires much larger concentrations (≥5 mm) than those that elicit the two effects described in this paper. In summary our present findings indicate that the two NBDs of CFTR are quite asymmetrical in terms of their ability to bind and occlude nucleotide, the interaction at NBD1 being more stable than that at NBD2. The influence of AMP-PNP is quite different than that predicted from its effect on channel gating and hence has implications for models based on these. There is a high affinity competitive interaction at NBD1 and a concomitant stimulatory influence on NBD2 arguing directly against the notion that it inhibits channel closing by preventing hydrolysis at NBD2 (1Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 25Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). These and other data showing that mutagenesis of crucial residues in either NBD does not influence channel opening and closing predictably (11Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) makes it difficult to attribute each transition separately to nucleotide interactions at one or other of the domains. Instead it may be more likely that opening and closing occur as a consequence of nucleotide binding and dissociation or hydrolysis at a functional unit involving both domains. Such an interpretation is consistent with the fact that the domains are physically associated in the intact protein and with proposals that the NBDs of other ABC proteins may participate jointly in ATP binding and hydrolysis utilizing amino acid residues from each (2Urbatsch I.L.

This was regardless of the extent of the size distribution heterogeneity of the fractions analyzed.

However, despite extensive experimental effort in the following years, no significant differences could be found either at the level of the nucleosome chromatin subunit (4Ausió J. Van Holde K.E.

Dover G. Fram R.J. Van Echo D.A. Clin. Cancer Res... 1998; 4: 629-634Google Scholar).Despite this, the structural implications of histone acetylation in mediating eukaryotic transcription remain to be established. Thus, although the functional implications seem clear, the mechanisms remain to be unraveled. Although the current coding hypothesis (15Strahl B.D. Allis D.C. Nature.. 2000; 403: 41-45Google Scholar) would explain the localized “short range” effects, an example of a transacting factor that requires histone acetylation for its interaction with the chromatin template has not yet been identified. Furthermore the fact that acetylation can occur over long stretches (several kilobases) of DNA (16Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane Robinson C. EMBO J... 1994; 13: 1823-1830Google Scholar) (“long range” effect) argues against the coding hypothesis being the only structural role for histone acetylation.In the present paper we have revisited some of the earlier structural analyses using well defined chromatin fractions that differ only in their extent of core histone acetylation. Although our results generally agree with most of the earlier data, they also underscore the structural differences and constraints that may be important for understanding the mechanisms by which histone acetylation exerts its functional effects.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFig. 1, A andB, shows the ionic strength dependence of the sedimentation coefficient of native and acetylated chromatin fractions with different average nucleosome content (Nw) and size distribution (see Fig. 1 C). To facilitate the comparison between the native and acetylated counterparts as well as to account for differences in Nw, the sedimentation coefficients at any given ionic strength (s20,w) for a given chromatin sample were normalized by dividing them by the sedimentation coefficient of the sample in plain buffer in the absence of salt (s20,w (b)] (27McGhee J.D. Nickol J.M. Felsenfeld G. Rau D.C. Nucleic Acids Res... 1983; 12: 4065-4075Google Scholar). As can be seen the dependence of the sedimentation coefficient on the NaCl concentration adopts a different shape that depends on the size distribution of the sample analyzed (24Ausió J. Borochov N. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol... 1984; 177: 373-398Google Scholar). However, independently of this, the sedimentation coefficients of the acetylated chromatin fibers consistently exhibited lower values than their corresponding native counterparts. Under solution conditions approaching physiological values a decrease of 11–15% was observed. Such decrease in the S values reflects a decrease in the folding of the acetylated chromatin fragments (28Ausió J. Biophys. Chem... 2000; 86: 141-153Google Scholar) when compared with that of the native fragments. The decrease observed is similar to that which had been reported earlier (27McGhee J.D. Nickol J.M. Felsenfeld G. Rau D.C. Nucleic Acids Res... 1983; 12: 4065-4075Google Scholar) and although relatively small is not negligible (29Dimitrov S. Makarov V. Apostolova T. Pashev I. FEBS Lett... 1986; 197: 217-220Google Scholar).Early studies on chromatin from butyrate-treated HeLa cells had shown that histone acetylation increased the overall solubility of chromatin (18Perry M. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem... 1982; 257: 7336-7347Google Scholar). However, little attention was paid to the histone H1 composition of the samples analyzed at that time. Therefore we decided to revisit this using long chromatin fibers that had been fractionated previously through sucrose gradients and that had exhibited the same linker histone composition. It is important to note that the method we have used to prepare chromatin fragments yields two chromatin fractions (SI and SE) (see “Materials and Methods”). In the case of the cells grown in the absence of butyrate (native), SI consists mainly of mononucleosomes that are almost completely depleted of histone H1. In contrast fraction SI from the butyrate-treated cells (acetylated) consists of an oligonucleosome (mainly 1–6 nucleosomes) fraction that (i) is histone H1-deficient (results not shown), (ii) contains highly hyperacetylated core histones (4Ausió J. Van Holde K.E. Biochemistry.. 1986; 22: 1421-1428Google Scholar), and (iii) is enriched in transcriptionally active sequences (30Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve P.G. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J... 1993; 296: 737-744Google Scholar). Only the SE fraction that had been size fractionated using sucrose gradients was used in our experiments.The results of the MgCl2 and NaCl solubility are shown in Fig. 2 (A and B, respectively). Fig. 2 C shows the difference in the extent of core histone acetylation of the samples being compared that otherwise exhibit an undistinguishable linker histone composition. Although the solubility data for the native fractions are very similar to those reported earlier (24Ausió J. Borochov N. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol... 1984; 177: 373-398Google Scholar, 31Ausió J. Sasi R. Fasman G. Biochemistry.. 1986; 25: 1981-1988Google Scholar, 32Guo X.-W. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1989; 264: 16873-16879Google Scholar), acetylated chromatin exhibited an enhanced solubility either in the presence of NaCl or MgCl2. The increased solubility of the acetylated fraction could be because of the acetylated histone tails adopting an α-helical conformation that would reduce the span of their interaction with nucleosomal DNA (19Wang X. Moore S.C. Laszckzak M. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 35013-35020Google Scholar) resulting in the presence of more free DNA.Figure 2Solubility of long chromatin (Nw ≥ 20) in MgCl2 (A) and NaCl (B). ○, acetylated chromatin; ●, native chromatin.

These results conclusively show that the binding affinity of histone H1 to chromatin is independent of the extent of the core histone acetylation. This is regardless of the more dynamic nature of the association between histone H1 and acetylated chromatin (33Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature.. 2000; 408: 877-881Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B the relative stoichiometry of histone H1 to core histones in the native and acetylated chromatin fractions used for these analyses was the same.Figure 3A, dissociation of histone H1 from acetylated (○) and native (●) HeLa chromatin.

The results shown in Fig.4 show that under the experimental conditions used by us the histone H1 variant composition of the native and acetylated chromatin samples analyzed in this work was identical. Hence none of the structural differences described above are the result of an altered linker histone composition.Figure 4Reversed-phase HPLC chromatograms of 0.4 N HCl-extracted histones from native (A) and acetylated chromatin (B). The insets show the SDS-PAGE of the region corresponding to linker histones (histone H1). The numbers on top of each lane correspond to those of the peak numbers in the chromatograms. The histone H1 variants are: lane 1, H1–5; lane 2, H1–3; lane 3, H1–4;lane 4, H1–4/H1–2; lane 5, H1–2; lane 6, of unknown origin. The histone H1 variant nomenclature was according to Refs. 41Albig W.

However, it has been shown recently that histone H1 phosphorylation regulates gene expression in vivo by creating a charge patch (36Dou Y. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell.. 2000; 6: 225-231Google Scholar). This possibly occurs by weakening the binding affinity of phosphorylated H1 by DNA in chromatin, thus mimicking loss of H1 (37Dou Y. Mizzen C.A. Abrams M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 641-647Google Scholar). We have shown also that in the absence of linker histones core histone acetylation results in a major unfolding of the chromatin fiber (38Garcia-Ramirez M. Rocchini C. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 17923-17928Google Scholar). This opens the possibility that under physiological (non-butyrate induced) conditions core histone acetylation may operate in conjunction with linker histone phosphorylation and lead to the formation of long stretches of unfolded fibers. This could account for the long range or so-called global effects of this modification (6Mutskov V. Gerber D. Angelov J. Ausió J. Workman J. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell.

BioEssays.. 2000; 22: 836-845Google Scholar), histone acetylation must have an important structural role at the level of the chromatin fiber. The possible implications of histone acetylation for eukaryotic gene transcription were recognized almost from the discovery of this post-translational histone modification more than 35 years ago (1Phillips D.M.P.

Chem... 1982; 257: 7336-7347Google Scholar). However, little attention was paid to the histone H1 composition of the samples analyzed at that time. Therefore we decided to revisit this using long chromatin fibers that had been fractionated previously through sucrose gradients and that had exhibited the same linker histone composition. It is important to note that the method we have used to prepare chromatin fragments yields two chromatin fractions (SI and SE) (see “Materials and Methods”). In the case of the cells grown in the absence of butyrate (native), SI consists mainly of mononucleosomes that are almost completely depleted of histone H1. In contrast fraction SI from the butyrate-treated cells (acetylated) consists of an oligonucleosome (mainly 1–6 nucleosomes) fraction that (i) is histone H1-deficient (results not shown), (ii) contains highly hyperacetylated core histones (4Ausió J. Van Holde K.E. Biochemistry.. 1986; 22: 1421-1428Google Scholar), and (iii) is enriched in transcriptionally active sequences (30Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve P.G. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J... 1993; 296: 737-744Google Scholar). Only the SE fraction that had been size fractionated using sucrose gradients was used in our experiments. The results of the MgCl2 and NaCl solubility are shown in Fig. 2 (A and B, respectively). Fig. 2 C shows the difference in the extent of core histone acetylation of the samples being compared that otherwise exhibit an undistinguishable linker histone composition. Although the solubility data for the native fractions are very similar to those reported earlier (24Ausió J. Borochov N. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol... 1984; 177: 373-398Google Scholar, 31Ausió J. Sasi R. Fasman G. Biochemistry.. 1986; 25: 1981-1988Google Scholar, 32Guo X.-W. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1989; 264: 16873-16879Google Scholar), acetylated chromatin exhibited an enhanced solubility either in the presence of NaCl or MgCl2. The increased solubility of the acetylated fraction could be because of the acetylated histone tails adopting an α-helical conformation that would reduce the span of their interaction with nucleosomal DNA (19Wang X. Moore S.C. Laszckzak M. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 35013-35020Google Scholar) resulting in the presence of more free DNA. To assess whether the folding and solubility differences could be the result of differences in the binding affinity of linker histones, an analysis of the salt-dependent dissociation of these histones from native and acetylated chromatin was carried out (see Fig.3). These results conclusively show that the binding affinity of histone H1 to chromatin is independent of the extent of the core histone acetylation. This is regardless of the more dynamic nature of the association between histone H1 and acetylated chromatin (33Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature.. 2000; 408: 877-881Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B the relative stoichiometry of histone H1 to core histones in the native and acetylated chromatin fractions used for these analyses was the same. It was argued several years ago that the reason why only relatively small changes were observed for the folding of the acetylated chromatin fiber could be the result of an increased amount of histone H10 (34D'Anna J.A. Tobey R.A. Gurley L.R. Biochemistry.. 1980; 19: 2656-2671Google Scholar, 35Ausió J. J. Cell Sci... 1992; 102: 1-5Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig.4 show that under the experimental conditions used by us the histone H1 variant composition of the native and acetylated chromatin samples analyzed in this work was identical. Hence none of the structural differences described above are the result of an altered linker histone composition. The results shown in Fig. 3 clearly indicate that core histone acetylation does not affect the binding affinity of linker histones to chromatin. However, it has been shown recently that histone H1 phosphorylation regulates gene expression in vivo by creating a charge patch (36Dou Y. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell.. 2000; 6: 225-231Google Scholar). This possibly occurs by weakening the binding affinity of phosphorylated H1 by DNA in chromatin, thus mimicking loss of H1 (37Dou Y. Mizzen C.A. Abrams M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 641-647Google Scholar). We have shown also that in the absence of linker histones core histone acetylation results in a major unfolding of the chromatin fiber (38Garcia-Ramirez M. Rocchini C. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 17923-17928Google Scholar). This opens the possibility that under physiological (non-butyrate induced) conditions core histone acetylation may operate in conjunction with linker histone phosphorylation and lead to the formation of long stretches of unfolded fibers. This could account for the long range or so-called global effects of this modification (6Mutskov V. Gerber D. Angelov J. Ausió J. Workman J. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1998; 18: 6293-6304Google Scholar, 18Perry M. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem... 1982; 257: 7336-7347Google Scholar, 39Vogelauer M. Wu J. Suka M. Grunstein M. Nature.. 2000; 408: 495-498Google Scholar) including the observed DNase I hypersensitivity usually associated with these chromatin domains (13Davie J.R. Spencer V.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol... 2000; 65: 299-340Google Scholar). The fact that the overall amount of acetylation in yeast is very high (∼13 acetylated lysines per nucleosome (40Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 13007-13011Google Scholar)) implies that in addition to operating as a histone code (15Strahl B.D. Allis D.C. Nature.. 2000; 403: 41-45Google Scholar, 42Turner B.M. BioEssays.. 2000; 22: 836-845Google Scholar), histone acetylation must have an important structural role at the level of the chromatin fiber. We thank John D.

Our recent studies indicate that ErbB4 interacts with postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 (SAP90), a PDZ domain-containing protein that does not interact with ErbB2 or ErbB3. Using as bait the ErbB2 C terminus, we identified Erbin, another PDZ domain-containing protein that interacts specifically with ErbB2. Erbin is concentrated in postsynaptic membranes at the neuromuscular junction and in the central nervous system, where ErbB2 is concentrated. Expression of Erbin increases the amount of ErbB2 labeled by biotin in transfected cells, suggesting that Erbin is able to increase ErbB2 surface expression. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Erbin interacts with PSD-95 in both transfected cells and synaptosomes. Thus ErbB proteins can interact with a network of PDZ domain-containing proteins.

The fast and accurate neurotransmission at this synapse is guaranteed by the high concentration of acetylcholine receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, which accounts for only 0.1% of total muscle surface (1Hall Z.W.

Remarkably, it is only the synaptic nuclei that actively transcribe genes encoding acetylcholine receptor subunits. Such synapse-specific transcription is mediated by neuregulin, a factor used by motoneurons to stimulate acetylcholine receptor synthesis at the neuromuscular junction. Neuregulin receptors are transmembrane tyrosine kinases of the ErbB family: ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. Stimulation by neuregulin of ErbB proteins leads to their tyrosine phosphorylation (3Altiok N.

Recent studies suggest that in addition to an essential role during development, neuregulin appears to regulate synaptic plasticity in the adult brain (13Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q.

ErbB proteins are not expressed evenly on the surface of cells. On the contrary, they are localized in subcellular compartments.

The mechanism by which ErbB proteins are localized in the subcellular compartments remains largely unknown. The intracellular portions of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases contain large C termini in addition to kinase domains. Thus, it is conceivable that ErbBs may interact with proteins that regulate their localization, surface expression, or kinase activity. Indeed, recent studies demonstrated that ErbB4, via its C terminus, interacts with postsynaptic density (PSD)1-95 (or SAP90), a PDZ domain-containing protein (13Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q.

PDZ domains are motifs of 80–90 amino acids which often bind to specific sequences at the extreme C termini of target proteins (19Bredt D.S.

PSD-95 uses multiple PDZ domains to cluster ion channels, receptors, and cytosolic signaling proteins in subcellular domains including synapses and cellular junctions (27Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The interaction of PSD-95 with ErbB4 potentially may allow for a localized signaling complex at synapses while minimizing unwanted cross-talk. Moreover, PSD-95 could enhance neuregulin signaling probably by promoting dimerization of ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinases (13Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M. Du Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, PSD-95 interacts with ErbB2 poorly and does not interact with ErbB3 (13Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M. Du Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L.

Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy, we identified a novel PDZ domain-containing protein that interacts specifically with ErbB2, but not ErbB3 or ErbB4. This protein was named B2BP for ErbB2-binding protein. B2BP was a polypeptide of 180 kDa. It had 16 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in the N terminus and a PDZ domain in the C terminus. While the study was in progress, Borg et al. reported the cloning of Erbin as an ErbB2-interacting protein (18Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Marchetto S. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15256-15263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis suggests that B2BP is the mouse homolog of Erbin. We will refer B2BP as Erbin in the manuscript. We demonstrate that Erbin is concentrated at the neuromuscular junction and a component of the PSD in the central nervous system. Erbin interacts with ErbB2 in synaptosomes. Moreover, Erbin increases surface expression of ErbB2 in transfected cells. Furthermore, Erbin interacts with PSD-95 in synaptosomes and in mammalian cells. These results suggest that ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases interact with a network of PDZ domain-containing proteins that may regulate neuregulin signaling and localization. To identify ErbB2-interacting proteins, the ErbB2 carboxyl terminus (amino acids 1251–1260) was generated by two complimentary oligonucleotides and subcloned into the pGBT9 yeast vector containing the Gal4 DNA binding domain (CLONTECH). The bait plasmid was then transformed into the yeast strain Y190 and used to screen mouse cDNA libraries in λACT2 or in pACT2 that contained the Gal4 transcription activation domain. Positive clones were selected on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and were confirmed further by a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (13Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M. Du Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Constructs containing PDZ domains of PSD-95, nNOS, α1-syntrophin, β1-syntrophin, or β2-syntrophin, or C termini of ErbB3 or ErbB4 have been described previously (13Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q.

C termini of ErbB2 mutants and NR2A (amino acids 1416–1464) were generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in pGBT9. Sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The yeast vectors are transformed into HF7c and Y190. Interactions were characterized by growth without leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and by a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity. The GST fusion protein containing the PDZ of Erbin (amino acid residues 1241–1371) was produced, affinity purified, and concentrated as described previously (29Mei L. Doherty C.A. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12254-12262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum against the GST-Erbin/PDZ fusion protein was raised in a New Zealand White rabbit by standard procedures (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). To purify the antibodies, two affinity columns were prepared by coupling GST protein and GST- Erbin/PDZ fusion protein to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instruction. The columns, 2 ml each, were washed sequentially with 10 ml of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, 10 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 10 ml of 100 mm triethylamine, pH 11.5, and equilibrated with 10 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. 2 ml of antiserum was diluted in 18 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and passed through the GST-coupled Affi-Gel 15 column three times. The flow-through was then loaded on the GST-Erbin/PDZ-coupled Affi-Gel 10 column three times. After washing the column with 20 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 20 ml of 500 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, antibodies were eluted with aliquots of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and collected in vials containing 500 μl of 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. The antibodies were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9% saline and stored in 0.02% sodium azide. Affinity-purified antibodies were used in all experiments unless otherwise specified.

Muscles were tweezed apart in PBS and incubated in PBS containing 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 50 min with frequent trituration. Dissociated cells were filtered through a 20-mesh screen and pelleted twice. They were resuspended in the growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 2% chick embryo extract, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin). The cells were plated on regular culture dishes for 30 min to get rid of fibroblasts prior to being plated on collagen-coated culture dishes at a density of 7.5 × 106 cells/10-cm dish. By the 4th day in vitro, myotubes were formed, and the cultures were treated with 3 μg/ml cytosine arabinoside for 24 h to inhibit fibroblast proliferation. Cells were transfected using the standard calcium phosphate technique. 2 days after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in the modified RIPA buffer (1 ml/100-mm plate), containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 50 μmphenylarsine, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, including protease inhibitors (6Si J.

Lysed cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was designated as cell lysate. Northern blot was done using a membrane containing mRNAs from multiple tissues (CLONTECH). An Erbin cDNA fragment (nucleotides 4044–4651) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a random prime method. The membrane was hybridized in a buffer (total 5 ml) containing 32P-labeled probe (∼4 × 108cpm/μg of cDNA), 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C overnight. It was then washed with 0.5 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 55 °C three times each for 30 min and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. Adult brains were homogenized in a homogenizing buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 4 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 20 units/ml Trasylol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with a glass-Teflon homogenizer as described previously (33Blackstone C.D.

Briefly, the ground tissue was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was designated the homogenate (S1). The homogenate was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 15 min, yielding P2 (the crude synaptosomal fraction) and S2. The P2 fraction was resuspended in the homogenizing buffer and used for coimmunoprecipitation studies. To purify PSDs, the resuspended P2 pellet was subjected to another centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was lysed by hypoosmotic shock in water, rapidly adjusted to 1 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, and stirred on ice for 30 min. The lysate was then centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min, yielding P3 and S3. The P3 pellet was resuspended in 0.25 mbuffered sucrose, layered onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient containing 0.8 m/1.0 m/1.2 msucrose, and centrifuged for 2 h at 65,000 × g in a Beckman SW-28 rotor. The gradient yielded a synaptosomal plasma membrane (SPM) fraction at the 1.0 m/1.2 msucrose interface. The SPM fraction was solubilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 in 0.5 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, yielding an insoluble PSD fraction and a soluble SPM extract after a centrifugation at 65,000 × g for 20 min. Synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle protein, was fractionated with the SPM fraction but was not present in the PSD fraction (see Fig. 8). Cell lysates (∼400 μg of protein) were incubated directly without or with indicated antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. They were then incubated with protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C on a rotating platform. After centrifugation, beads were washed four or five times with the modified RIPA buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation of Erbin from rat brain P2 fraction was done as described previously (13Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M. Du Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein containing the PDZ of Erbin (amino acids 1241–1371) was induced in BL21 cells with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis). Equal amounts of GST fusion protein beads (∼50 μg of protein) were incubated with cell lysates overnight at 4 °C on a rotating platform. After centrifugation, beads were washed four or five times with wash buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 10 mmsodium phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4). Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins resolved on SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Nitrocellulose blots were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBS-T) containing 5% milk followed by an incubation with 1% milk with the indicated antibodies except the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, which required 3% bovine serum albumin in the blocking buffer and 1% bovine serum albumin in the blotting buffer. After washing three times for 15 min each with TBS-T, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by washing. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). In some experiments, after visualizing an immunoactive protein, the nitrocellulose filter was incubated in a buffer containing 625 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoenthanol, and 2% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min, washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in 50 mm TBS at room temperature for 1 h, and reblotted with different antibodies. Normal or denervated (5 days postdenervation) muscles were rapidly dissected, stretched on a board, and frozen in isopentane cooled with dry ice. 10-μm sections were prepared using a cryostat, thaw mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and stored at −80 °C. Sections of adult rat muscles were incubated with 2% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature to reduce background staining and then incubated with the affinity-purified antibodies against Erbin or preimmune serum in 2% normal goat serum in PBS overnight at 4 °C. In some experiments, affinity-purified antibodies were preincubated with 10 nm GST-Erbin/PDZ overnight at 4 °C prior to immunohistochemical studies. After washing the sections five times with PBS, each for 30 min, the sections were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco) and rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescent images of cells were captured on a Sony CCD camera mounted on a Nikon E600 microscope using Photoshop imaging software. To label surface proteins, cells were washed with cold PBS containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in the same buffer at room temperature for 30 min. The labeling reaction was quenched by incubation with 100 mm glycine for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then lysated in the modified RIPA buffer. Lysates were incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Molecular Probes) overnight at 4 °C. Bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein was assayed according to the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The C terminus (-DVPV*) of ErbB2 fits the consensus site for PDZ binding. However, whereas ErbB4 binds strongly to PSD-95, ErbB2 has little or no affinity for PSD-95 (13Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M. Du Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that bind to ErbB2, we generated several bait constructs composed of the ErbB2 C terminus in various lengths. Most of the baits showed autonomous transactivation activity in various yeast strains except the one with the last 10 amino acid residues (amino acids 1251–1260). Screens using this bait of mouse muscle, mouse brain, and human heart cDNA libraries led to isolation of cDNAs all of which encoded partial sequences of an apparently same protein with a PDZ domain in the C terminus. This protein was initially named as B2BP for ErbB2-binding protein because it only interacted with ErbB2 and not ErbB3 or ErbB4 (see below). While this study was in progress, Borget al. reported Erbin (18Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicated that B2BP was the mouse homolog of Erbin. Thus, this protein will be referred as Erbin in the rest of this manuscript. Erbin showed high homology to Densin-180, a protein identified previously as a postsynaptic component (35Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Walikonis R.S. Oguni A. Khorosheva E.M. Jeng C.-J. Asuncion F.J. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 423-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like Densin-180, Erbin had 16 LRR domains in the N terminus. In the C terminus, there is a PDZ domain of group I which is characterized by a conserved histidine residue (37Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The homology between Erbin and Densin-180 was 73% in LRR domains, 71% in the PDZ domain, and 39% in the middle region. Nice clones were isolated from the libraries that encoded two fragments of Erbin: Erbin965 and Erbin1254 (Fig.1 A). The binding of Erbin to ErbB2 was dependent on the PDZ domain of Erbin because deletion of the PDZ domain prevented the interaction. Furthermore, the PDZ alone was sufficient to bind to ErbB2. Although Erbin showed high homology with Densin-180, ErbB2 did not interact with the PDZ domain of Densin-180 (Fig. 1 A), nor did it interact with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 (Fig. 1 A) and of Scribble, nNOS, or α1-, β1-, and β2-syntrophin (data not shown). The binding of Erbin to ErbB2 was dependent on the ErbB2 C terminus. Mutation of the valine residues at the −1 and −3 positions to alanine prevented ErbB2 from interacting with Erbin (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, Erbin interacted specifically with the C terminus of ErbB2 and did not interact with C termini of the ErbB3, ErbB4, or NR2A subunit of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (Fig.1 C). To characterize further the interaction between Erbin and ErbB proteins, we examined the ability of Erbin's PDZ domain to bind to ErbBs inin vitro pull-down assays. Lysates from HEK 293T cells transfected with ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4 were incubated with GST-Erbin fusion protein immobilized on agarose beads. Bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with individual anti-ErbB antibodies. Consistent with the results from yeast two-hybrid assays, GST-Erbin was only able to pull down ErbB2 (Fig.2 A). In contrast, ErbB3 or ErbB4 was undetectable in the Erbin complex. To determine whether ErbB2 interacts with Erbin in mammalian cells, we expressed ErbB proteins with or without Myc-tagged Erbin in HEK 293T cells. Lysates of transfected cells were incubated with individual anti-ErbB antibodies, and the resulting immunocomplex was blotted with anti-Myc antibodies. Erbin was detected in the immunoprecipitates from cells that had been cotransfected with ErbB2 and Erbin (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that ErbB2 associates with Erbin in vivo. In contrast, Erbin was not detected in the ErbB3 or ErbB4 immunoprecipitates (Fig.2 C). Northern blot analysis was used to study mRNA expression of Erbin. The membrane loaded with mRNAs from multiple tissues was probed with a32P-labeled Erbin DNA fragment (encoding amino acids 1241–1371 plus the 3′-noncoding region). A major transcript at 7.5 kilobases was detected in various tissues (Fig.3, top panel). The expression was high in the lung, heart, and kidney, moderate in the brain, skeletal muscle, and testis, and little, if any, in the spleen and liver. In contrast, expression of the Densin-180 mRNA was brain-specific as reported previously (35Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6839-6852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 7.4-kilobase transcript of Densin-180 was detected only in the brain, but not in any of tested periphery tissues (Fig. 3, middle panel). Note the exposure time of blots for Densin-180 (10 days) and Erbin (1 day), whereas both used a similar amount of probes (5 ng/ml, 5 ml) with same specific activity (4 × 108 cpm/μg of DNA). These results suggest that the expression level of Erbin may be at least five times higher than that of Densin-180 in the brain. To study Erbin expression at the protein level, an"

We previously reported an analysis of the IL-12 p40 promoter in RAW264.7 macrophages. Multiple control elements were involved in activation of transcription by bacterial products. A critical control element, located between −96 and −88, interacts with C/EBP family members. In this study, using a strategy to demonstrate functional activity in a minimal promoter context, three novel cis-acting elements are found to have an important role in IL-12 p40 promoter activation by lipopolysaccharide. One of these elements is characterized in detail. Mutations from −79 to −74 in the murine IL-12 p40 promoter significantly reduce lipopolysaccharide-induced promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate binding of AP-1 family members to this region. Spacing between the C/EBP and AP-1 site is important for promoter activation, suggesting cooperativity between these elements. c-Jun and a mutant c-Jun molecule activate the IL-12 p40 promoter and synergistically activate the promoter when co-expressed with C/EBPβ.

Among its biologic activities, IL-12 production is necessary for the differentiation of T-helper-1 (Th1) cells and for the secretion of the Th1 cytokine, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (1Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Accordingly, IL-12 and Th1 cells are required for cell-mediated immunity against intracellular microbes (2Abbas A.K.

Conversely, overexpression of Th1 cytokines and IL-12 may contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory disorders (8Seder R.A. Kelsall B.L. Jankovic D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2745-2748PubMed Google Scholar), including Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, the regulated expression of IL-12 in antigen-presenting cells is a critical event in the pathogenesis of infectious and inflammatory diseases. IL-12 is composed of two covalently linked glycosylated chains, p40 and p35, that are encoded by separate genes and together form the biologically active p70 heterodimer (9Gubler U. Chua A.O.

Therefore, studies of IL-12 transcriptional regulation have focused on the p40 gene. Murphy and colleagues (13Murphy T.L. Cleveland M.G. Kulesza P. Magram J. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified an NF-κB site between −122 and −132 relative to the transcription start site in the murine p40 gene that was necessary for induction of promoter activity by LPS. In another series of investigations, Ma and colleagues (14Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 15Ma X. Gri G. Trinchieri G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 795: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have identified an Ets protein DNA-binding sequence between −212 and −207 in the human p40 gene that was implicated in promoter activation by LPS. We have reported a comprehensive functional analysis of the murine and human IL-12 p40 promoters in RAW264.7 cells (17Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The p40 promoter was strongly induced by heat-killedListeria monocytogenes and LPS. An important control element defined by this analysis, located between −96 and −88 relative to the murine transcription start site, interacts with C/EBP proteins. This element was functionally synergistic with the NF-κB site. However, mutations in several other elements had functional effects on promoter activation. Thus, induction of the IL-12 p40 promoter by bacterial products will be defined by a complex series of events. In this study, a functional role for three novel cis-acting elements in the p40 promoter is demonstrated in reporter assays by utilizing a combination of multiple substitution and deletion mutants. One of these elements is characterized in detail. Mutations from −79 to −74 in the murine IL-12 p40 promoter significantly reduce LPS-induced promoter activation and correlate with binding of AP-1 family members by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Spacing between the adjacent C/EBP and AP-1 sites and orientation of the AP-1 site are important for promoter activation, suggesting cooperativity between these two sites. Expression of a dominant negative AP-1 protein, A-Fos, in RAW264.7 cells inhibits p40 promoter activation by LPS, demonstrating a functional role for AP-1 family members. Furthermore, c-Jun and a mutant c-Jun molecule TAM67 activate the IL-12 p40 promoter and synergistically activate the promoter when co-expressed with C/EBPβ. Likewise, c-Jun and TAM67 activate the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) promoter in RAW264.7 cells. Finally, experiments using inhibitors and activators of signal transduction pathways identify the region of the promoter from −101 to +55 as a target for the p38 kinase, the N-terminal Jun kinase (JNK), and the toll-like receptor (TLR) signal transduction pathways. The murine wild type IL-12 p40 promoter −350 to +55 region was inserted into the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector pCAT basic (Promega) modified by addition of KpnI and BglII sites in the polylinker as described previously (17Plevy S.E.

All site-directed mutant plasmids described in this paper were generated by two-step polymerase chain reaction using overlapping internal primers containing a mutant site (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6849) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction-generated mutant promoters were cloned into pCAT basic vector (Promega) with a modified polylinker or pGL2B vector (Promega) and sequenced before use in transfection experiments. Mammalian expression plasmids for human wild type c-Jun, c-Fos, JunB (Tom Curran), TAM67 (Michael Birrer), and C/EBPβ (from Steven McKnight) were described previously (17Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H.

A multimerized NF-κB element luciferase reporter plasmid and a human TNF-α promoter (−283 to +113) luciferase reporter plasmid were obtained from Adrian Ting. A multimerized consensus AP-1 DNA-binding element CAT reporter gene (TRE-CAT) was provided by Andre Nel. The RAW264.7 murine macrophage line (American Type Culture Collection) was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. LPS was purchased from Sigma. L. monocytogenes was obtained from Hao Shen, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell extract was from John Belisle. Antibodies against Pu.1, C/EBP, AP1, ATF, and Rel family members were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. RAW267.4 cells were transiently transfected using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) by the described protocol with modifications. For each transfection, 2.5 μg of plasmid were mixed with 100 μl of DMEM (without serum and antibiotics) and 10 μl of SuperFect reagent. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and then 600 μl of DMEM complete medium was added and immediately placed onto the cells in 6-well plates. After incubation for 3–4 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed with PBS and split equally into two wells. One well was activated with LPS (to final concentration 5 μg/ml) 24 h later. Sixteen to eighteen hours after activation, the cells were harvested by using 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). CAT assays were performed with 75 μg of total protein from cell extracts. The conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms was assessed by thin layer chromatography and quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Luciferase activity was determined from 20 μl of cell extract, as described previously (17Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell.

EMSA probes were made by annealing equal amount of single-stranded oligonucleotides with 5′-GATC overhangs (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.). 200 ng of annealed probe was labeled by filling in with [α-32P]dGTP and[α-32P]dCTP by Klenow enzyme. Labeled probes were purified with NucTrap purification columns (Stratagene). Sequences of the IL-12 p40 EMSA probes are demonstrated in the text (see Fig. 4 A). The sequence of the canonical AP-1 EMSA probe is 5′ gatcCGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA, and the canonical C/EBP probe is 5′ gatcAAGCTGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCAGCTT 3′. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (17Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), using 105 cpm probe and 5 μg of nuclear extracts per reaction. In supershift experiments, 1–2 μl of antibody was added to each reaction, and the nuclear extract/antibody mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min before adding probes. DNA-binding complexes were separated by 5% polyacrylamide/Tris glycine/EDTA gel run at 4 °C for 4 h at 150 V. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-AR 5 film at −80 °C in the presence of an intensifying screen. In our previous analysis of the murine and human IL-12 p40 promoters, the C/EBP element spanning −93 to −88, the NF-κB element at −131 to −120, and the TATA box were the only sites convincingly shown to be important for p40 promoter function (17Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, two results suggested that other functionally important elements exist within the promoter. First, deletion or substitution mutations at other locations appeared to have less significant effects on promoter activity. Second, 25% of the wild type promoter activity was retained following disruption of the NF-κB element. This activity appeared to be too strong to be directed solely by a C/EBP-binding site and a TATA box. In particular, of the 21 clustered substitution mutants analyzed in this previous study, four (−114/−109, −107/−102, −80/−75, and −62/−57) were identified that demonstrated a 2–3-fold decrease in promoter activation (17Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These elements, which have relatively minor effects individually, may have additive or synergistic effects when combined with mutations in other sites. As mutations in the C/EBP site abrogate promoter activity, the functional significance of other potentially important sites (−114/−109, −107/−102, −80/−75, −62/−57) needs to be evaluated in the presence of an intact C/EBP site. The −114/−109, −107/−102, and −62/−57 substitution mutants were described previously (17Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, the −80/−75 mutant from the initial study was re-derived by changing a 13-base pair sequence from −85 to −73. This more extensive mutant may demonstrate more significant functional effects. Furthermore, as random mutants may also have artifactual effects, a different random sequence was inserted to rule out this possibility. Site-directed mutants in two elements other than the C/EBP site were constructed in the −355 to +55 wild type p40 promoter-CAT reporter (Fig. 1 A). The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was transiently transfected with double mutant, single mutant, and wild type plasmids. Consistent with our previously reported results, a mutation in the NF-κB element (Fig.1 B, −132/−127) reduces LPS-induced promoter activation by around 80%, and a mutation in the C/EBP site (Fig. 1 B,−93/−88,) virtually eliminates promoter activity. Simultaneous disruption of the NF-κB element and the sequence from −85 to −73 markedly reduces promoter activation by LPS compared with the respective single mutations (Fig. 1 B; compare the double mutant [−85/−73 and −132/−127 to the single mutant −85/−73 and the single mutant −132/−127). Three other mutations (−114/−109, −107/−102, and −62/−57), when combined with mutations in the NF-κB site, also demonstrate significantly diminished p40 promoter activity (Fig. 1 B). A double mutant in the −114/−109 and −107/−102 elements does not attenuate promoter activation to a greater extent than the respective single mutants (Fig.1 B). Therefore, one control element likely resides within these two adjacent sequences. In summary, although each of these single mutations had a relatively small effect on promoter activation, their combination with a mutation in the NF-κB site demonstrates dramatic decreases in LPS-induced promoter activity. These results identify three novel elements, from −114 to −102, −82 to −73, and −62 to −57, important for activation of IL-12 p40 transcription by LPS, and provide clear evidence that an intact C/EBP site is not sufficient for promoter activation. As a second approach, a minimal inducible IL-12 p40 promoter was defined. From our previous analysis, a promoter deletion of all elements upstream of the C/EBP site mediated strong LPS-inducible promoter activity of greater than 10% of the wild type −355 to +55 promoter (17Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Therefore, functional control elements likely exist downstream of the C/EBP element. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutants were created in elements downstream of the C/EBP site in a promoter from −101 to +55, which deletes all elements upstream of the C/EBP element. As expected, a mutation in the C/EBP site within this minimal promoter eliminates LPS-induced activation (Fig.2, −101 to +55 and −93/−88) in RAW264.7 cells. This experiment confirms the functional importance of the element from −85 to −73, as a mutation in this site markedly reduces promoter activity (Fig. 2, −101 to +55 and −82/−74). Furthermore, the −62 to −57 mutant sequence reduces promoter activity by ∼70% (Fig. 2, −101 to +55 and −62/−57). By two different approaches, the sequence between −82 and −73 is demonstrated to have an important functional role in IL-12 p40 promoter activation by LPS. This control element may contain a binding site for one transcription factor or may represent a composite binding site for two or more proteins. To define better critical nucleotides within this element, 3-base pair site-directed mutants were constructed within this sequence (Fig.3 A). Two mutants, −79/−77 and −76/−74, demonstrate significantly decreased LPS-induced promoter activity, whereas mutants in the flanking sequences retain wild type activity (Fig. 3 B). Thus, an important regulatory element is localized to the region spanning −79 to −74. To identify DNA-protein interactions in the −79 to −74 region, EMSA probes were constructed that spanned 1) the C/EBP-binding site and −79/−74 (118/69), 2) the C/EBP site alone (112/78), and 3) −79/−74 excluding the C/EBP site (88/63) (Fig.4 A). With the 88/63 probe, a slow mobility DNA-protein complex is detected that is strongly induced in nuclear extracts from RAW264.7 cells activated with LPS (compare Fig. 4 B, lanes 9 and 10, upper arrow). This complex is present in EMSAs with probe 118/69 (Fig.4 B, lanes 1–4), containing the C/EBP site and downstream sequences, but not with probe 112/78 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5–8) that spans only the C/EBP site. The DNA sequence from −81 to −73, CTAGTCAGT, has homology to a canonical AP-1 DNA-binding element (30Wingender E. Dietze P. Karas H. Knuppel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The fos/junproto-oncogenes encode proteins that are major components of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. Several Fos-related (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) and Jun-related (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) proteins have been described. These leucine zipper proteins form the transcriptionally active AP-1 complex as Fos/Jun heterodimers or Jun/Jun homodimers (31Brown P.H. Kim S.H. Wise S.C. Sabichi A.L. Birrer M.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1013-1021PubMed Google Scholar,32Ransone L.J. Visvader J. Wamsley P. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3806-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Competition with an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a consensus AP-1-binding site in 100-fold molar excess completely inhibits formation of this complex in EMSAs, strongly suggesting that AP-1 family members interact with this sequence in the IL-12 p40 promoter (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and 12). A consensus C/EBP-binding site partially competes AP-1 DNA binding activity in gel shift experiments, suggesting that either C/EBP family members are present in this complex or that AP-1 dimers may to some extent bind to a consensus C/EBP element (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and11). Competition with a consensus NF-κB DNA-binding site oligonucleotide does not inhibit complex formation on all three radiolabeled probes (data not shown). Mutants within the 88/63 EMSA probe, 79/77m (mutated from −79 to −77) and 76/74m (mutated from −76 to −74) eliminate binding of the AP-1 complex (Fig.5, lanes 3–6). These specific mutants correlate with decreased promoter activity in functional assays (Fig. 3 B). The presence of AP-1 family members in this DNA-binding complex was confirmed by supershift experiments. A polyclonal antibody to the AP-1 family Fos (Fig. 6, lanes 5and 15, K-25) strongly inhibits and supershifts the DNA-protein complex. By using antibodies that recognize specific Fos family members, it appears that the most abundant Fos DNA binding activity is attributable to c-Fos (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and16). Antibodies to Fra-1 and Fra-2 cause minor inhibition of complex formation (Fig. 6, lane 8, 9, 18, and19). An antibody that recognizes the Jun family member, JunB, strongly inhibits and supershifts the DNA-binding complex (Fig.6, lanes 3 and 13). Additionally, an antibody to c-Jun causes inhibition and supershift of the complex (Fig. 6,lanes 2 and 12). Antibodies directed against the leucine zipper proteins ATF-1, ATF-2, and C/EBPβ demonstrate little, if any, inhibition of complex formation in nuclear extracts from LPS-treated cells (data not shown). Likewise, antibodies against unrelated transcription factors Pu.1 (Fig. 6, lanes 10 and20), NF-κB p50, NF-κB p65, and the glucocorticoid receptor (data not shown) do not supershift or inhibit the DNA-binding complex. Thus, the AP-1 DNA-binding complex on the IL-12 p40 promoter is composed of JunB and c-Jun homodimers and/or heterodimers with c-Fos. However, other AP-1 family members and leucine zipper proteins may be present as well. Proper spacing of cis-acting elements may be necessary for the interaction of transcriptional activators with the basal transcription machinery, or it may be required for cooperative binding of transcription factors (33Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 34Nikolajczyk B.S. Nelsen B. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4544-4554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spacing restrictions may involve distance or alignment of sites on the DNA double helix. The functional effects of spacing between the TATA box and regulatory elements as well as between control elements within the IL-12 p40 promoter were next determined. Insertion mutants were constructed within the −355 to +55 p40 promoter that increase the distance between the AP-1 and the C/EBP site by 5, 10, and 15 bp, approximating one-half, one, and one and a half helical turns of DNA, respectively (Fig. 7 A). In addition, insertion mutants adding 5 and 10 bp between the C/EBP site and NF-κB element and 5 and 10 bp between the C/EBP site and the TATA box were created to determine spacing requirements between C/EBP, NF-κB, and the basal transcription machinery. All mutations were inserted within sequences that were not critical for promoter activation (−45/−40 for mutants between TATA and C/EBP site, −121/−117 for mutants between NF-κB site and C/EBP site, and −84/−85 for C/EBP and AP-1 elements) (17Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These mutants were tested by transient transfection in unactivated and LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. Spacing mutations between the TATA box and C/EBP site have little effect on promoter activity (>80% of wild type activity; data not shown). However, mutations between the NF-κB and C/EBP sites, and the C/EBP and AP-1 elements reveal significant effects on promoter induction. A 10-bp insertion between the NF-κB and C/EBP elements decreases LPS-induced promoter activation by 65% (Fig. 7 B). A 10-bp insertion between the C/EBP and AP-1 sites diminishes LPS-induced promoter activation by one-third, whereas a 5- and 15-bp insertion decreases activation by 50% (Fig. 7 B). As random sequences inserted within the promoter may fortuitously create a protein-binding site, the 5- and 10-bp mutants between the C/EBP and AP-1 elements were re-derived with different sequences, and similar results were demonstrated in reporter assays (data not shown). As the effect of spacing between the C/EBP and AP-1 sites may have been minimized by redundant control elements, insertion mutants were then constructed within the −101 to +55 minimal promoter. In this context, the effect of 5-, 10-, and 15-bp insertions are more dramatic, reducing promoter activity more than 60% (Fig. 7 C). Based on comparison to consensus sequences, there are two potential AP-1-binding sites within the −79 to −74 region (Fig. 3). To localize better the AP-1 DNA-binding element, and to determine whether the sequence and orientation of this site in the IL-12 p40 promoter influences activity, additional mutants were created. Within each of these two potential AP-1 sites, a canonical AP-1-binding site was created, and the orientation of"

However, it is uncertain if individual regulatory pathways operate in isolation or if interconnectivity between unrelated pathways is required for the orchestration of the entire hypertrophic response. To this end, we investigated the interconnectivity between calcineurin-mediated cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and p38 MAPK signaling in vitro andin vivo. We show that calcineurin promotes down-regulation of p38 MAPK activity and enhances expression of the dual specificity phosphatase MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1). Transgenic mice expressing activated calcineurin in the heart were characterized by inactivation of p38 and increased MKP-1 expression during early postnatal development, before the onset of cardiac hypertrophy. In vitro, cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes infected with a calcineurin-expressing adenovirus and stimulated with phenylephrine demonstrated reduced p38 phosphorylation and increased MKP-1 protein levels. Activation of endogenous calcineurin with the calcium ionophoreA23187 decreased p38 phosphorylation and increased MKP-1 protein levels. Inhibition of endogenous calcineurin with cyclosporin A decreased MKP-1 protein levels and increased p38 activation in response to agonist stimulation. To further investigate potential cross-talk between calcineurin and p38 through alteration in MKP-1 expression, the MKP-1 promoter was characterized and determined to be calcineurin-responsive. These data suggest that calcineurin enhances MKP-1 expression in cardiac myocytes, which is associated with p38 inactivation.

Current pharmacologic treatment strategies for cardiac hypertrophy utilize general inhibitors of certain neuroendocrine stimulatory pathways (such as those mediated by angiotensin II, endothelin-1, and catecholamines), which are thought to mediate hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes, in part, by activating specific intracellular signal transduction cascades (1van Zwieten P.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In recent years, a number of intracellular signaling pathways have been implicated as important downstream transducers of neuroendocrine stimuli and generalized stress stimuli in cardiac myocytes. Specifically, activation of certain G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases have been shown to promote Ras activity, the three major branches of the MAPK1 signaling cascade (ERKs, JNKs, and p38s), protein kinase C, and calcineurin (reviewed in Refs. 2Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar and 3Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1998; 24: 345-352Crossref Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Activation of these various intracellular signaling pathways/factors has, in many instances, been directly associated with the induction of the cardiac hypertrophic response in either the hearts of transgenic mice or in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (2Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar,3Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1998; 24: 345-352Crossref Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Data implicating p38 MAPK as a regulator of the hypertrophic response have largely been obtained in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The G-protein-coupled receptor agonists PE and endothelin-1 are potent activators of p38 MAPK in cardiomyocytes (4Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Overexpression of activated MKK3 or MKK6 (upstream activators of p38) in neonatal cardiomyocytes was shown to induce hypertrophy and atrial natriuretic factor expression in vitro (5Zechner D.

Pharmacologic inhibition of p38 kinase activity with the antagonists SB203580 or SB202190 was shown to attenuate agonist-stimulated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in culture (4Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 5Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J.

In addition, pharmacologic or dominant negative inhibition of p38 signaling significantly reduced agonist-induced b-type natriuretic peptide promoter activity in vitro (8Liang F. Gardner D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 9Liang F. Lu S. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 188-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, three additional studies reported that p38 inhibition was not sufficient to attenuate agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy under certain conditions, suggesting a more specialized role for p38 MAPK signaling in vitro (4Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin.

Within the last 2 years, a number of reports have implicated a calcineurin-dependent signaling pathway in the cardiac hypertrophic response. Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase that directly regulates the nuclear translocation of a family of transcription factors referred to as NFAT (reviewed in Ref. 2Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Cardiac-specific expression of either constitutively active calcineurin or constitutively nuclear NFATc4 mutant protein in transgenic mouse hearts resulted in a dramatic hypertrophy response that quickly transitioned to heart failure (12Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). Inhibition of calcineurin activity with either cyclosporin A (CsA) or by infection with a specific calcineurin-inhibitory adenovirus was sufficient to block agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (12Molkentin J.D.

While these and other studies have implicated calcineurin as a hypertrophic regulator, it is uncertain how calcineurin is interconnected with other intracellular signaling pathways. Recently, we reported that calcineurin activation was associated with activation of protein kinase Cα, protein kinase Cθ, JNK, and ERKin vitro and in vivo (14De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of p38 MAPK was not characterized. In this report, we show that calcineurin activation is associated with a down-regulation of p38 MAPK activity in calcineurin transgenic mouse hearts and in calcineurin adenovirus-infected cardiomyocytes. Calcineurin does not directly dephosphorylate p38 MAPK but rather is associated with enhanced expression of the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-1. Characterization of the MKP-1 upstream regulatory region demonstrates that calcineurin enhances promoter activity, suggesting potential signaling cross-talk between calcineurin and p38 MAPK pathways through MKP-1. The activated MEK1 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. C. J. Marshall, while activated MKK6 and MKK7 were gifts of Dr. J. Han and Dr. E. Nishida, respectively.

Metz R. Chen L. Mattei M.G. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was used to clone a mouse genomic fragment spanning from −633 to +100 base pairs (relative to the transcription start site) for insertion into the luciferase reporter pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI). Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were generated and cultured as described previously (13Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hearts were collected from 1–2-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat neonates; the ventricles were cut in four equal parts in a balanced salt solution and enzymatically digested through multiple rounds in 0.05% pancreatin (Sigma) and 84 units/ml collagenase (Worthington). The cells were centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min and resuspended in M199 media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mmol/L). Afterward, the cells were differentially plated for 1 h to remove contaminating nonmyocytes. The enriched cardiomyocyte fractions were then plated on gelatinized dishes and cultured the following day in serum-free M199 media containing 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mmol/literl-glutamine. Cardiomyocytes were maintained in serum-free M199 media for 48 h before adenoviral infections and/or treatments. Culturing of 10T1/2 fibroblasts and COS-7 cells was described previously (12Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). All transfections employed Fugene (Roche) in 6-cm tissue culture dishes, after which cells were harvested for Western blot or luciferase determinations (24 h later). The calcineurin or MKK expression plasmids were transfected at one-fourth the DNA content relative to the MKP-1 reporter construct. Protein extracts were generated for luciferase determinations as described previously (12Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). Characterization of replication-deficient adenovirus expressing constitutively active calcineurin (AdCnA) and β-galactosidase (Adβgal) was recently described in detail (14De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). All recombinant adenoviral vectors were plaque-purified in HEK293 cells, expanded, and titered by plaque assays in HEK293 monolayers embedded in agarose. Cardiomyocytes were infected with each virus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 plaque-forming units for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified 6% CO2 incubator. Afterward, the cultures were placed in serum-free M199 media for an additional 24 h prior to treatments. Under these conditions, ∼98% of the cells showed expression of the viral gene insert. Protein extracts were generated from cardiomyocytes or COS-7 cells using extraction buffer, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (14De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Quantitative chemiluminescent detection was performed with Vistra enhanced chemifluorescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and scanned utilizing a Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Antibodies used included anti-phospho-p38, anti-p38, anti-phospho- ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-MEK1/2, anti-phospho-MKK3/6 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-MKP-1, and anti-MKP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Both His-tagged MKK6 (E) and p38 were purified as described previously (19New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C. Han J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3372-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 μg of MKK6 (E) and 0.2 μg of p38 bacterial produced and purified proteins were incubated with 20 units of calcineurin (BioMol) or 8 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and incubated in 1× kinase buffer containing 10 mCi of [32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions containing calcineurin enzyme were incubated with excess calcium and calmodulin as directed by the manufacturer (BioMol). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× loading buffer and 5 min of boiling before electrophoretic separation on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All images were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Expression of activated calcineurin in the hearts of transgenic mice induces a striking hypertrophy response that is detectable by 9–14 days after birth and results in a 3-fold increase in heart size by 6 weeks of age (12Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). It was of interest to examine the status of other intracellular signaling pathways in calcineurin transgenic hearts to characterize the mechanisms that might underlie this dramatic increase in heart size. We focused an analysis on the p38 branch of the MAPK signaling pathway, since it has been shown to play a modulatory role in the cardiac hypertrophic process (3Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1998; 24: 345-352Crossref Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Hearts from calcineurin transgenic or wild-type littermate mice were analyzed at 4 days of age before any signs of cardiac hypertrophy were observed, guarding against secondary effects associated with hypertrophy itself. Western blot analysis of cardiac protein extracts from 4-day old hearts demonstrated a 2.9-fold down-regulation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation from calcineurin transgenic mice without a change in total p38 MAPK protein (Fig. 1 A,asterisks). ERK1/2 phosphorylation status was not affected at this time point (Fig. 1 A). A similar down-regulation of p38 MAPK was also seen at 8 and 14 days of age, but such down-regulation was gradually lost by day 24 and older (data not shown; see “Discussion”). These results suggest that early neonatal expression of activated calcineurin in the heart promotes p38 MAPK inactivation before the onset of significant cardiac hypertrophy. To characterize a potential mechanism whereby calcineurin might promote p38 MAPK inactivation, Western blotting was performed to characterize the dual specificity phosphatases MKP-1 and MKP-2 as well as the upstream MAPK kinase factors MEK1/2 and MKK3/6 (Fig. 1, Band C). MEK1/2 or MKK3/6 phosphorylation status was not significantly affected, suggesting that the upstream activation cascade was not influenced by calcineurin. However, a 2.3-fold increase in MKP-1 protein levels, but not MKP-2, was observed in 4-day-old calcineurin transgenic hearts. These data suggest that p38 MAPK inactivation is associated with augmented MKP-1 protein levels in calcineurin transgenic hearts. MAPK activation occurs through the dual phosphorylation of a threonine and adjacent tyrosine residue (TXY). A large family of at least nine individual dual specificity protein phosphatases (MKPs) has been shown to specifically recognize this unique phosphorylation motif in MAPK factors, causing their dephosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 20Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Each of these dual specificity MKPs differs in substrate specificity (p38versus ERKs versus JNKs), tissue distribution, subcellular localization, or inducible expression profile (20Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition to the dual specificity phosphatases, protein phosphatase 2A, a serine/threonine phosphatase has also been shown to specifically dephosphorylate ERK1/2 (21Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 22Chajry N. Martin P.M. Cochet C. Berthois Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Parameswaran N. Nambi P. Hall C.S. Brooks D.P. Spielman W.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 388: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This observation suggested the possibility that the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin might directly inactivate p38 MAPK. To test this possibility, bacterial generated p38 MAPK or a kinase-dead mutant of p38 (KM) was phosphorylated with purified MKK6 and subsequently incubated with purified calcineurin protein in an excess of calmodulin and calcium. The data demonstrate that calcineurin is unable to directly dephosphorylate p38 MAPK in vitro, while a control utilizing calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase efficiently dephosphorylated p38 MAPK (Fig. 2 A). These data indicate that calcineurin is unlikely to directly dephosphorylate p38 MAPK. Dual specificity phosphatases, in general, are regulated at the transcriptional level so that stress stimuli or agonist stimulation augment mRNA and protein content (20Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MKP-1 is most selective for p38 MAPK, less selective for JNK, and less selective again for ERK1/2 (20Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Franklin C.C Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 25Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, MKP-2 is more selective for ERK1/2 and JNK compared with p38 (20Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Since both MKP-1 and MKP-2 are prominently expressed in cardiac myocytes, we examined their potential association with reduced p38 MAPK phosphorylation in response to calcineurin activation (24Franklin C.C Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 26Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 27Li C. Hu Y. Mayr M. Xu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Cultured cardiomyocytes were infected with either AdCnA or Adβgal (24 h) and treated with PE for 1 h to induce p38 MAPK phosphorylation. The data demonstrate that PE augmented p38 MAPK phosphorylation by ∼1.8- and 1.4-fold in uninfected and Adβgal-infected cultures, respectively (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, AdCnA infection was associated with a 3.5-fold reduction in p38 MAPK phosphorylation in cardiac myocytes compared with myocytes stimulated with PE alone (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, MKP-1 protein expression was most potently induced by the combination of AdCnA infection and PE treatment (Fig. 2 B). While these data suggest that calcineurin induces MKP-1 protein expression, control experiments consisting of either AdCnA or Adβgal alone (no PE stimulation) did not show induction of MKP-1 expression at 12, 24, 48, or 72 h postinfection (data not shown). These results suggest that calcineurin requires an additional signal to promote efficient MKP-1 expression. MKP-2 levels were also stimulated by PE, but AdCnA infection did not promote a further increase. To examine the association between calcineurin and p38 MAPK activation in more detail, CsA was used to pharmacologically inhibit calcineurin in cultured cardiomyocytes. CsA treatment promoted greater p38 MAPK phosphorylation at both 30 min and 1 h of PE stimulation compared with PE stimulation alone (Fig.3). These data indicate that calcineurin inhibition is associated with greater p38 MAPK phosphorylation. CsA treatment also significantly decreased MKP-1 protein expression at 30 min and 1 h (Fig. 3). Specifically, MKP-1 protein levels were decreased by ∼2.5-fold after 1 h of PE stimulation in the presence of CsA compared with PE stimulation alone (Fig. 3). In contrast, PE-induced MKP-2 protein levels were unaffected by CsA (Fig.3). These data suggest that inhibition of endogenous calcineurin with CsA decreases basal and/or inducible MKP-1 protein levels in cardiac myocytes, which is associated with enhanced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. MKP-1 is transcriptionally regulated in response to stress or mitogen stimulation, resulting in at least a 30 min delay in measurable phosphatase activity (20Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Consistent with this time course of MKP-1 expression and turnover, PE and CsA treatment did not affect p38 MAPK phosphorylation within 5 or 15 min of treatment; nor was there a change in basal MKP-1 at 5 or 15 min (Fig. 3). However, by 30 min, increased MKP-1 protein was detectable, and this increase was sensitive to CsA, which was associated with greater p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Indeed, after 1 h of PE and CsA treatment, a more pronounced modulation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and MKP-1 expression was observed. Collectively, these data suggest that calcineurin activity enhances MKP-1 protein expression in response to agonist stimulation through a transcriptional mechanism. p38 MAPK phosphorylation status and MKP-1 protein levels were also examined after calcium ionophore stimulation. Calcium ionophores enhance intracellular calcium concentration, which stimulates calcium-sensitive signaling pathways, including calcineurin. The calcium ionophore A23187 promoted a decrease in p38 MAPK phosphorylation after 30 min and 3 h of treatment without affecting total p38 MAPK protein levels (Fig.4). Likewise, A23187 treatment was also associated with increased MKP-1 protein levels, while MKP-2 protein levels were unaffected. CsA treatment also reversed the decrease in p38 MAPK phosphorylation mediated by A23187, which was further associated with a detectable decrease in MKP-1 protein levels (Fig. 4). Collectively, these data indicate that activation of endogenous calcineurin with calcium ionophore results in decreased p38 MAPK activation and increased MKP-1 protein content in cardiac myocytes. Such an interpretation is also consistent with a recent report demonstrating that the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, negatively regulated MAPK activity in a neuronal-like cell line by specifically inducing MKP-1 (28Durham P.L. Russo A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1570-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine if the identified association between calcineurin and p38 MAPK inactivation was specific to cardiac myocytes, we performed transient transfection experiments in another cell type, COS-7. An expression vector encoding the upstream activator of p38 MAPK, MKK6, was transfected into COS-7 cells, resulting in significant p38 MAPK phosphorylation assessed by Western blotting (Fig.5 A). However, co-transfection of an activated calcineurin expression vector along with the MKK6 encoding vector significantly reduced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig.5 A). While expression of activated calcineurin in COS-7 cells promoted p38 MAPK inactivation, the potential association with MKP-1 expression in this cell type was uncertain. Accordingly, calcineurin transfection by itself did not result in a significant increase in MKP-1 protein in COS-7 cells (Fig. 5 B). However, MKP-1 protein levels increased when calcineurin was co-transfected with MAPK kinase expression vectors (MEK1, MKK6, or MKK7), suggesting that calcineurin requires MAPK co-stimulation to promote efficient MKP-1 expression (Fig. 5 B). Such results are consistent with the observations in cardiomyocytes whereby calcineurin promoted the greatest increase in MKP-1 protein levels when co-stimulated by PE (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these data suggest that efficient MKP-1 induction requires coordinate input from calcineurin and MAPK signaling pathways. The mouse MKP-1 genomic organization was previously characterized, including the upstream regulatory region and transcription start site (18Noguchi T. Metz R. Chen L. Mattei M.G. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A −633 base pair fragment of the MKP-1 promoter was cloned and fused to a luciferase reporter (Fig. 6 A). The MKP-1 promoter contains a TATA box, Sp1 element, CAAT box, serum response factor binding site, and multiple AP1 and cAMP-response element-binding protein stress-responsive elements (29Sommer A. Burkhardt H. Keyse S.M. Luscher B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, consensus or near consensus NFAT binding elements were not identified within the minimal MKP-1 promoter (see “Discussion”). The −633 base pair MKP-1 promoter was transiently co-transfected with an expression vector encoding activated calcineurin or wild-type and activated NFAT expression vectors. We determined that calcineurin augmented promoter activity 4–5-fold in multiple experiments, suggesting that calcineurin directly regulates MKP-1 promoter activity (Fig. 6 B). Calcineurin-mediated induction of the MKP-1 promoter was blocked by co-transfection with an expression vector encoding a 194-amino acid calcineurin-inhibitory domain from the protein chain (13Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). NFAT transcription factors are direct downstream mediators of calcineurin-induced alterations in gene expression in multiple cell types. However, not all calcineurin-induced transcriptional effects are mediated by NFAT factors. Likewise, we observed that co-transfection of the MKP-1 promoter construct with full-length NFATc4 or NFATc3 expression vectors or constitutively nuclear forms of these factors (ΔNFATc4 and ΔNFATc3) did not significantly augment promoter activity (Fig. 6 B). We also failed to identify any additional increase in promoter activity when calcineurin was co-transfected in conjunction with NFATc4 or NFATc3 (data not shown), which is consistent with the lack of an identifiable consensus NFAT binding site within the −633 base pair MKP-1 promoter. Collectively, these data indicate that calcineurin regulates the minimal MKP-1 promoter in an NFAT-independent manner. Last, we also investigated the potential cooperation between calcineurin and MAPK signaling in the activation of the MKP-1 promoter. Expression vectors encoding activated forms of the MAPK kinase signaling factors MEK1 (activates ERKs), MKK6 (activates p38), and MKK7 (activates JNK) each stimulated MKP-1 promoter activity in co-transfection experiments, similar to calcineurin (Fig.6 C). Furthermore, co-transfection experiments between calcineurin and individual MAPK kinase factors promoted an additive or greater than additive increase in MKP-1 promoter activity (Fig.6 C). These data indicate that the calcineurin regulates MKP-1 promoter activity in coordination with MAPK stress-responsive signaling pathways. This interpretation is consistent with the coordinated increase in MKP-1 protein level that was observed between calcineurin and MAPK signaling responses in cardiomyocytes and COS-7 cells. A wide array of intracellular signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of cardiac myocyte hypertrophic growth. Intracellular signaling pathways such as calcineurin/NFAT and MAPK represent central mediators of reactivity in cardiac myocytes as well as other diverse cell types. For example, calcineurin and MAPK signaling pathways are critical mediators of T-cell reactivity where they regulate proliferation and cytokine production in response to antigen. A challenge that remains is to elucidate the potential interconnectivity between calcineurin and MAPK signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes as well as other cell types. Here we show that calcineurin activation promotes a decrease in p38 MAPK activity in both transgenic mice and cultured cardiomyocytes through a potential mechanism involving the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-1. Transgenic mice expressing an activated calcineurin cDNA in their hearts were characterized by a significant reduction in basal p38 MAPK phosphorylation at early developmental times. However, this decrease in p38 MAPK activation gradually diminished with age so that by 24 days postnatal, altered activation was less obvious. Such regulation might be explained by the following observations. First, p38 MAPK activation is itself dynamically regulated during postnatal development such that greater activation is observed during early developmental periods when the heart is undergoing developmental hypertrophy (30Sussman M.A. Welch S. Gude N. Khoury P.R. Daniels S.R. Kirkpatrick D. Walsh R.A. Price R.L. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 2101-2113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In older hearts, basal p38 MAPK activation status is probably reduced so that a further reduction in activity (as mediated by calcineurin) would be less obvious. Second, as calcineurin transgenic hearts progressively hypertrophy with age, secondary effects associated with pathologic hypertrophy might influence the activity of various intracellular signaling pathways. In this respect, the observed reduction in p38 MAPK activity in very young calcineurin transgenic hearts suggests a more direct interconnection between calcineurin and p38 MAPK, without the potential secondary effects associated with cardiac hypertrophy itself. In vitro, we observed that prolonged stimulation of cardiac myocytes with PE, which potently activates calcineurin (13Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), promoted a gradual reduction of p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 3). This reduction in p38 phosphorylation after just 1 h of PE treatment was largely prevented with CsA, a calcineurin inhibitor (Fig. 3). These data suggest that prolonged agonist stimulation can lead to p38 inactivation, in part, through a calcineurin-regulated pathway. This interpretation is consistent with a recent report by Hines et al. (11Hines W.A. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H331-H341PubMed Google Scholar) in which prolonged electrical pacing of cardiac myocytes in culture resulted in p38 inactivation despite a progressive hypertrophy response. Interestingly, electrical pacing of cultured cardiomyocytes was also recently shown to directly activate calcineurin/NFAT signaling (31Xia Y. McMillin J.B. Lewis A. Moore M. Zhu W.G. Williams R.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that calcineurin activation can promote p38 MAPK inactivation in cultured cardiomyocytes. Calcineurin is a serine/threonine phosphatase that has not been reported to act on MAPK proteins. In contrast, a specialized family of immediate early genes encoding dual specificity phosphatases have been identified that act as specific negative regulators of ERKs, JNKs, and p38. MKPs are largely regulated at the transcriptional level such that stress stimuli or mitogen stimulation induce gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 20Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MKP-1 is most selective for p38 MAPK at physiologic levels of expression, although high levels of expression are also associated with JNK and even mild ERK1/2 inactivation (24Franklin C.C Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 25Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Tymitz K.M. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Indeed, at physiologic expression levels MKP-1 directly binds to p38 kinases but not ERKs or JNKs (24Franklin C.C Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 25Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These reports are consistent with our observation that an approximate 2-fold increase in MKP-1 protein in day 4 calcineurin transgenic hearts is associated with p38 MAPK inactivation, but not ERKs or JNKs (Fig. 1, and data not shown). The inability of purified calcineurin to directly dephosphorylate p38 MAPK in vitro suggested that calcineurin might potentially act indirectly through MKP-1. Indeed, calcineurin transgenic hearts at 4 days of age and AdCnA infection of PE-stimulated cardiac myocytes demonstrated a dramatic increase in MKP-1 protein levels but no change in MKP-2 (Fig. 2 B). In addition, inhibition of calcineurin with CsA led to a loss of MPK-1 induction and even promoted a decrease in basal MKP-1 protein levels in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with the recent observation that MAPK transcriptional responses in a neuronal-like cell line were inhibited with a calcium ionophore through a mechanism involving enhanced MKP-1 expression (28Durham P.L. Russo A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1570-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To examine the ability of calcineurin to directly regulate MKP-1 expression, we characterized the mouse minimal MKP-1 promoter. Co-transfection of an activated calcineurin expression vector with an MKP-1 promoter-luciferase fusion reporter resulted in a 4–5-fold increase in promoter activity compared with reporter alone, suggesting that calcineurin might regulate MKP-1 at the transcriptional level. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that MKP-1 protein levels were not altered by 5 or 15 min of PE stimulation in cardiac myocytes, but levels were augmented in a CsA-sensitive manner by 30 and 60 min. Despite a potential direct role for calcineurin in regulating MKP-1 expression, we also observed that calcineurin acted in concert with MAPK signaling pathways to more efficiently up-regulate MKP-1 expression, suggesting that calcineurin and MAPK coordinate maximal MKP-1 induction. To more carefully evaluate the transcriptional mechanism whereby calcineurin might regulate MKP-1 promoter activity, we co-transfected full-length or constitutively nuclear expression vectors for NFATc4 and NFATc3. However, NFAT factors did not significantly induce MKP-1 promoter activity; nor were good consensus sites present within the −633 base pair region that was analyzed. We did identify a site at +25 base pairs (5′-AGGAAAGCG-3′) in the 5′-untranslated region that weakly resembled a NFAT element, but this site failed to interact within vitro translated NFATc4 protein by gel shift assay, while a control NFAT site from the IL-4 promoter demonstrated significant binding (data not shown). While it is reasonable to conclude that the MKP-1 minimal promoter is regulated in an NFAT-independent manner, it is formally possible that one or more relevant NFAT sites lie upstream of the area analyzed. A large number of reports have demonstrated that the MKK3/6-p38 MAPK signaling branch is sufficient to initiate the hypertrophic program in cultured cardiomyocytes. For example, transfection of cultured cardiomyocytes with a MKK6-encoding expression vector or infection with a MKK6-encoding adenovirus produced a profound hypertrophy responsein vitro (5Zechner D.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3518-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In addition, Zhang et al. (33Zhang D. Gaussin V. Taffet G.E. Belaguli N.S. Yamada M. Schwartz R.J. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) generated transgenic mice expressing an activated form of TAK1 (MAPK kinase kinase signaling factor), which resulted in p38 MAPK activation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and neonatal lethality in vivo. While p38 MAPK signaling is undoubtedly sufficient to induce a hypertrophic response, evidence supporting a necessary role for this signaling factor in the hypertrophic response is less certain. Indeed, electrical pacing of cultured cardiomyocytes leads to a down-regulation of p38 MAPK activity, despite progressive hypertrophy (11Hines W.A. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H331-H341PubMed Google Scholar), and pharmacologic p38 MAPK inhibition was reported to be ineffective in blocking endothelin-1-induced hypertrophy in vitro (10Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Despite these reports, others have observed a complete or partial attenuation of agonist-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy with p38 MAPK inhibitors (4Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 5Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J.

Collectively, these various reports suggest that p38 MAPK plays a role in the hypertrophic response, although its function may be more specialized or associated with acute temporal effects. Calcineurin transgenic mice are characterized by a dramatic hypertrophy response, despite a down-regulation of p38 MAPK signaling. In vitro, calcineurin adenovirus efficiently induces a hypertrophy response characterized by increased cell size, increased sarcomeric organization, and increased atrial natriuretic factor expression despite a down-regulation in p38 signaling (see Ref. 34De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn G.W. II. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar and Fig.2 B). These results indicate that p38 MAPK activation is not required for the initiation or progression of a calcineurin-induced hypertrophy response in vitro or in vivo. However, it is likely that p38 MAPK plays a role in other forms of reactive hypertrophy or is involved in aspects of myocyte survival (apoptosis). This possibility is supported by the observation that p38 MAPK activation can promote apoptosis in cultured cardiomyocytes (6Wang Y. Huanf S. Sah V.P. Ross J. Heller-Brown J. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), while calcineurin signaling was shown to be cardioprotective (34De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn G.W. II. Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These relationships are of particular interest, since calcineurin (antiapoptotic) promotes p38 MAPK inactivation. Accordingly, sustained p38 MAPK activation in the heart might be predicted to promote decompensation and cardiomyopathy, consistent with the phenotype of TAK1 transgenic mice (33Zhang D. Gaussin V. Taffet G.E. Belaguli N.S. Yamada M. Schwartz R.J. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In this respect, p38 MAPK activation might represent a deleterious signaling pathway in the heart and is a desirable target for pharmacologic inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2057199764,"We recently reported that amino acid residues contained within a putative EF hand motif in the domain III S5-H5 region of the α1B subunit affected the relative barium:calcium permeability of N-type calcium channels (Feng, Z. P., Hamid, J., Doering, C., Jarvis, S. E., Bosey, G. M., Bourinet, E., Snutch, T. P., and Zamponi, G. W. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 5726–5730). Since this region partially overlaps with residues previously implicated in block of the channel by ω-conotoxin GVIA, we assessed the effects of mutations in the putative EF hand domain on channel block by ω-conotoxin GVIA and the structurally related ω-conotoxin MVIIA. Both of the toxins irreversibly block the activity of wild type α1B N-type channels. We find that in addition to previously identified amino acid residues, residues in positions 1326 and 1332 are important determinants of ω-conotoxin GVIA blockade. Substitution of residue Glu1332 to arginine slows the time course of development of block. Point mutations in position Gly1326to either arginine, glutamic acid, or proline dramatically decrease the time constant for development of the block. Additionally, in the G1326P mutant channel activity was almost completely recovered following washout. A qualitatively similar result was obtained with ω-conotoxin MVIIA, suggesting that common molecular determinants underlie block by these two toxins. Taken together the data suggest that residue Gly1326 may form a barrier, which controls the access of peptide toxins to their blocking site within the outer vestibule of the channel pore and also stabilizes the toxin-channel interaction.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 823-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar)). Among the family of ω-conotoxins, two prominent members are ω-conotoxin GVIA, a 27-amino acid peptide derived from the Conus geographus sea snail, and ω-conotoxin MVIIA, a 25-amino acid toxin isolated from the venom of the Conus magus marine snail (2Olivera B.M. Miljanich G.P. Ramachandran J. Adams M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 823-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Both of these toxins potently block N-type calcium channels from a variety of species and nerve tissues (11Woppmann A. Ramachandran J. Miljanich G.P. Mol. Cell.

Block develops rapidly and is only incompletely reversible even after prolonged washout (12Fox J.A. Pfleugers Arch. 1995; 429: 873-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both toxins have been reported to display a high degree of selectivity for the N-type calcium channel α1B subunit (15Williams M.E. Brust P.F. Feldman D.H. Patthi S. Simerson S. Maroufi A. McCue A.F. Velicelebi G. Ellis S.B. Harpold M.M. Science. 1992; 257: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and ω-conotoxin GVIA has become a commonly used tool for the identification of native N-type calcium currents. While little is presently known concerning the toxin structural requirements, which underlie the high affinity and selectivity of ω-conotoxins GVIA and MVIIA for N-type calcium channels, some of the N-type calcium channel regions that participate in the blocking interaction have been elucidated. Utilizing a chimeric channel approach in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, Ellinor and co-workers (16Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) identified crucial components of the binding site of ω-conotoxin GIVA in the external vestibule of the α1B channel in the domain III S5-S6 region, suggesting that this toxin likely acts via physical occlusion of the pore. While the binding site for ω-conotoxin MVIIA has not yet been identified via molecular biological techniques, both biochemical and electrophysiological data suggest that ω-conotoxin MVIIA competes with ω-conotoxin GVIA for a common, or at least partially overlapping, receptor site (2Olivera B.M. Miljanich G.P. Ramachandran J. Adams M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 823-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 17McDonough S.I. Swartz K.J. Mintz I.M. Boland L.M. Bean B.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 15: 2612-2623Crossref Google Scholar). We have recently reported that point mutations in an external EF hand homology motif located on the N-type calcium channel α1Bsubunit immediately adjacent to the ω-conotoxin GVIA binding site identified by Ellinor et al. (16Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) affects the permeation characteristics of the channel (18Feng Z.P. Hamid J.

In view of its proximity to the putative ω-conotoxin GVIA receptor site, we investigated whether mutations in this region could affect the characteristics of ω-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA block of the channel. We report here that certain point mutations within the putative EF hand motif increase the affinity of the channel for ω-conotoxin GVIA. Moreover, one of the mutations, a replacement of residue Gly1326 with proline, is sufficient to dramatically enhance the unblocking rate of the toxin such that block by both ω-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA is fully reversible over a time course of <10 min. Hence, residues immediately outside the region identified previously by Ellinor et al.(16Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) contribute to block of N-type calcium channels by ω-conotoxins, and a single amino acid residue in this region is sufficient to control the reversibility of toxin block. The G1326P, E1332R, D1323R, and E1321R point mutation constructs have been described by Feng et al. (18Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Jarvis S.E. Bosey G.M. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5726-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The R1325D, G1326K, G1326E, and G1326Y additional constructs were generated as described by Feng et al. (18Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Jarvis S.E. Bosey G.M. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5726-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, a SplI-AflII fragment (∼4.5 kilobases) was excised from the full-length cytomegalovirus-α1B (CMV) construct and ligated into pSL1180. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and successful mutagenesis, and absence of sequence errors was confirmed via DNA sequencing. Subsequently, the mutated SplI-AflII fragment was introduced into the full-length clone in the cytomegalovirus (CMV) expression vector via restriction enzyme digestion an ligation and its presence confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney tsa-201 cells were maintained in a 37°C CO2 incubator in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin). The cells were split at 85% confluence using trypsin EDTA and plated on glass coverslips at 5–10% confluence. The cells were then allowed to recover for ∼12 h at 37 °C before transfection. Immediately before transfection, the medium was replaced, and the cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding for calcium channel α1B, β1b, and α2-δ subunits and EGFP (at a molar ratio of 1:1:1:0.3) via the calcium phosphate method. After 12 h, the cells were washed with fresh medium, allowed to recover for additional 12 h, and subsequently stored at 28 °C in 5% CO2 for 1–3 days before whole cell recording. Recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) linked to a personal computer equipped with pClamp version 7.0. Patch pipettes (Sutter borosilicate glass, BF 150-86-15) were pulled using a Sutter P-87 microelectrode puller and subsequently fire-polished using a Narashige microforge. The whole cell patch clamp recording (membrane ruptured) procedures used here were similar to those described by Beedle and Zamponi (19Beedle A.M. Zamponi G.W. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 260-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transferred to a 3-cm culture dish containing recording solution comprised of 20 mm BaCl2 (or CaCl2), 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mmTEA1-Cl, 10 mmglucose, 87.5 mm CsCl (pH 7.2 with TEA-OH). Pipettes with resistances of 2–4 MΩ were filled with internal recording solution containing 108 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 4 mmMgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with TEA-OH). After patch rupture, cell capacitance was neutralized, and series resistance was compensated. Currents were elicited by stepping from a holding potential of −100 mV to various test potentials using Clampex 7.0 software and an Axopatch 200 B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). ω-Conotoxin GVIA (RBI Chemicals) and MVIIA (Sigma) were dissolved first, respectively, in water and acetic acid and then diluted in the external recording solution. Solutions containing various concentrations of toxin were delivered directly to the cells by means of a gravity-driven microperfusion system, which allows complete solution exchanges in less than 1 s. Currents underwent little if any rundown during the time course of a typical experiment. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at a sampling frequency of 2 kHz. Data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments). All curve fittings were carried out using Sigmaplot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific). The time constant, τ, for onset of block was determined from the equationI(t)/I(t = 0) = exp(−t/τ), where I(t) is the current amplitude at time t after application of the toxin, and I(t = 0) is the control current amplitude immediately prior to toxin application. Statistical analysis was carried out using SigmaStat 2.0 (Jandel Scientific). Differences between mean values from each experimental group were tested using a Student's t test for two groups and one way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. All error bars given reflect S.E values, numbers in parentheses indicate numbers of cells. Fig. 1 illustrates the effects of ω-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA on N-type (α1B+β1b+α2-δ) calcium channels transiently expressed in HEK tsa-201 cells. The application of 1 μm of either toxin completely removes current activity, which cannot be recovered following washout over the time course of 10 min. Fig. 1 B compares the time courses of N-type channel block for various concentrations of both toxin. For both toxins the time course of development of block is accelerated with increasing toxin concentration, although on average development of ω-conotoxin MVIIA block occurs about three times more rapidly than that of ω-conotoxin GVIA. Similar to what has been previously reported for both native channels (14Boland L.M. Morrill J.A. Bean B.P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5011-5027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and α1B channels transiently expressed in Xenopus oocytes (16Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), block of both toxins was only poorly reversible such that even prolonged washout (7–15 min) resulted in the recovery of only a minor fraction of the N-type current. Fig. 1 C illustrates the dependence of the inverse of the time constant for development of block on the toxin concentration. Consistent with a bimolecular interaction between the toxin molecule and the channel, the relation was well described by a linear fit in the case of each of the two toxins. The blocking rate constants (kon), obtained from the regression lines, were, respectively, 1.06 and 2.93 μm−1min−1 for ω-conotoxins GVIA/MVIIA, consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1 B. However, it is not possible to accurately determine the unblocking rate constants (koff) from either the regression lines or from the time course of recovery from block because of the poor reversibility of the blocking action. We have previously reported that high voltage-activated calcium channels contain a highly conserved putative EF hand motif within the domain III S5-H5 region (18Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Jarvis S.E. Bosey G.M. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5726-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 for the α1B subunit, this region is localized immediately adjacent to a series of amino acid residues, which have been implicated in ω-conotoxin GVIA block of the channel (16Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In a previous study we showed that replacement of the three negative charges in the putative EF hand motif with positively charged residues, or substitution of the central glycine (Gly1326), resulted in an ablation of the differential selectivity of the channel between barium and calcium ions without affecting other major biophysical properties of the channel such as activation, inactivation, or block by cadmium ions (18Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Jarvis S.E. Bosey G.M. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5726-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test whether this region of the channel might modulate the blocking action of ω-conotoxin GVIA, we first expressed the triple (E1321K,D1323R,E1332R) α1B mutant in HEK tsa-201 cells (together with the ancillary β1b and α2-δ subunits) and examined the dose dependence of ω-conotoxin GVIA blocking kinetics of the mutant channel. As shown in Fig.3, the time course of development of ω-conotoxin GVIA block in the triple mutant channel was significantly slowed compared with that observed with the wild type channel, indicating that one or a combination of the three substituted residues contribute to ω-conotoxin GVIA block of the channel. Nonetheless, the application of 1 μm concentrations of the toxin was sufficient to eliminate all current activity, and as with the wild type channel, block of the mutant channel was irreversible (Fig. 3,A and B). To determine which of the three residues was responsible for mediating the slowing of the blocking kinetics, we examined ω-conotoxin GVIA block of both a single E1332R and a double (E1321K,D1323R) mutant. As seen in Fig. 3 B, a single substitution of residue 1332 with arginine was sufficient to account for the slowing of the blocking kinetics, whereas the double mutant behaved similar to the wild type channel. This is shown quantitatively in form of a comparison of the blocking rate constants of ω-conotoxin GVIA block of the wild type and the mutant channels (Fig. 3 C). Mutation in position Glu1332 to arginine resulted in a 2-fold reduction in konand suggests that the glutamate contributes in a significant manner to ω-conotoxin GVIA block of N-type calcium channels.Figure 3Effect of mutations in positions 1321, 1323, and 1332 on toxin block. A, current records obtained with mutant (E1321K,D1323R, E1332R), (E1321K,D1323R), or E1332R channels (coexpressed with β1b and α2-δ) in the absence and presence of 1 μm ω-conotoxin GVIA. Note that all three mutants are irreversibly and completely blocked at this toxin concentration. B, representative time course of development of block of wild type and mutant N-type calcium channels by 1 μm ω-conotoxin GVIA. Note that the triple mutant and the single E1332R mutant channel display slowed blocking kinetics compared with the wild type or the (E1321K,D1323R) mutant construct.C, blocking rate constants obtained with the wild type and mutant channels. The kon values were obtained by fitting linear regressions as shown in Fig. 1 C for each individual experiment. Error bars denote S.E. values,numbers in parentheses reflect numbers of experiments, and the asterisks indicate statistical significance relative to the wild type channels (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In our previous study examining permeation, we replaced the central glycine residue (Gly1326) within the putative external EF hand domain with proline (18Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Jarvis S.E. Bosey G.M. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5726-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine whether this substitution affects block of the channel by ω-conotoxin GVIA, the G1326P mutant was expressed with the appropriate ancillary subunits in tsa-210 cells, and ω-conotoxin GVIA blocking kinetics were examined. Fig.4 shows that development of block was accelerated 30-fold compared with the wild type channel (Fig.4 B). More strikingly, upon washout of the toxin current activity could be almost completely recovered over the time course of about 10 min (Fig. 4, A and B). Since the time course for development of block is inversely proportional to the sum of blocking and unblocking rates, such an increase in the rate of recovery from block is predicted to contribute to the observed 30-fold decrease in the time constant for development of block. To isolate any direct effects of the mutation on the true blocking rate constant, the time course for development of block was determined at several toxin concentrations, and the inverse of the time constant of development of block was plotted as a function of toxin concentration. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the relation was nicely described by a linear fit. Furthermore, from the slope and the y intercept of the regression line, both the blocking (kon = 17.51 μm−1min−1) and the unblocking (koff = 0.72 min−1) rate constants were found to be significantly increased in the G1326P mutant compared with the wild type channel, indicating that the access of the toxin to its binding site is enhanced in the mutant, but concomitantly the stability of the binding interaction is dramatically reduced. To determine whether this effect is also observed with other substitutions at the G1326 position, we generated three additional mutations (G1326K, G1326E, and G1326Y). Interestingly, the G1326Y mutant resulted in channels that could no longer be functionally expressed. However, the G1326K and G1326E mutants expressed well, and as shown in Fig. 5A and B, the time course of development of block was accelerated, albeit not as dramatically as with the G1326P mutant. In both cases, block remained irreversible over the time course of a typical experiment. This is also evident from the kinetic analysis presented in Fig. 5, C andE, where the slope of the regression line (and hence, the blocking rate constant) is clearly increased, whereas the intercept on the ordinate is similar to that obtained with the wild type channels. To test whether the presence of a proline residue per se was sufficient to render the channels reversible from ω-conotoxin GVIA block, we generated an E1332P mutant. As shown in Fig. 5 D, ω-conotoxin GVIA block of this mutant was not reversible, hence the presence of a proline per se near in the putative EF hand motif is insufficient to render the channels reversible from toxin block. Interestingly, the effect of the E1332P mutation on the blocking rate constant was opposite to that obtained with the E1332R construct, which tended to slow the blocking kinetics. Overall, our data indicate that at least two additional residues besides those identified previously by Ellinor et al. (16Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) are important determinants of ω-conotoxin GVIA block and that residue 1326 is an important factor in controlling both access of the toxin and the strength of interaction with the channel. The striking effects observed with the G1326P mutant raise an obvious question: is ω-conotoxin MVIIA block affected in a similar manner? As shown in Fig. 6, both the development and the reversibility of block of the channel by ω-conotoxin MVIIA are dramatically enhanced in the Gly1326 mutant. However, there were subtle differences in the manner by which the mutation affected block by the two toxins. Whereas the effects of the mutation on recovery from ω-conotoxin MVIIA block was even more pronounced than those observed with the GVIA isoform (i.e. complete recovery from block after 5 min), the effect of the mutation on the blocking rate constant was greater for ω-conotoxin GVIA (16-fold increase in kon) than for ω-conotoxin MVIIA (7-fold increase). Nonetheless, these data indicate that there is significant overlap in the channel structural determinants of the access of ω-conotoxins GVIA and MVIIA to their binding sites, consistent with biochemical data showing that both toxins compete for a common binding site (11Woppmann A. Ramachandran J. Miljanich G.P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

To date, the exact sites of action of the gating inhibitors on the calcium channel α1 subunit remain enigmatic. Furthermore, unlike in the case of potassium channels (5Tenenholz T.C. Klenk K.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27551-27558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the detailed molecular mechanisms by which calcium channels are inhibited by pore-blocking toxins remain poorly understood. To date, there has only been one comprehensive study that has examined the channel structural determinants of ω-conotoxin GVIA block. Using a series of chimeras between α1A P/Q-type and α1B N-type calcium channels, Ellinor et al. (16Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) were able to show that the domain III S5-S6 region was critically important for block of N-type calcium channels by ω-conotoxin GVIA. In particular, residues Gln1327, Glu1334, Glu1337, and Gln1339 were found to contribute to ω-conotoxin GVIA block, with Glu1337 mediating the largest effect. In the present study, we have identified two additional residues that appear to be important for the interaction of the channel with pore-blocking toxins, residues Gly1326 and Glu1332. Since these residues are conserved in α1A and α1Bchannels (33Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 113-141Google Scholar), their contributions to toxin block could not have been detected with a chimeric approach. It is interesting to note that amino acid substitutions adjacent to the region identified by Ellinoret al. (16Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (i.e. Glu1332 and Gly1326) mediated a more pronounced effect on ω-conotoxin GVIA block, compared with mutations that occur further upstream (i.e. Glu1321 and Asp1332). This could perhaps suggest that residue 1326 might form an outer boundary for the ω-conotoxin GVIA receptor site. This is further supported by data obtained with an R1325E construct, which did not display altered toxin block (not shown). We have previously reported that the expression of the G1326P, E1332R, and a double (E1321K,D1323R) mutant resulted in currents that no longer supported a differential permeability to calcium and barium ions, but otherwise displayed biophysical properties that did not differ significantly from those of the wild type channels, including activation, inactivation, and block by divalent cations (18Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Jarvis S.E. Bosey G.M. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5726-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We attributed the effects on ion selectivity to a highly localized specific disruption of the function of a putative calcium binding EF hand spanned by residues 1321–1332, rather than a global structural rearrangement of the α1B subunit. The observation that substitutions in positions 1321 and 1323 did not affect ω-conotoxin GVIA block is consistent with a highly localized and specific effect of amino acid substitutions in these positions on ion selectivity. Moreover, that substitutions in positions Gly1326 and Glu1332 did not affect channel gating, and cadmium block (18Feng Z.P. Hamid J. Doering C. Jarvis S.E. Bosey G.M. Bourinet E. Snutch T.P. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5726-5730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is also consistent with a localized effect of these mutations on the toxin-channel interaction. The most pronounced effect on toxin action was observed with the G1326P construct in that the blocking rate constant was increased 16-fold, and block became entirely reversible. This suggests that the mutation increases both the accessibility of the binding site and at the same time results in a less stable interaction between the toxin and the channel. Interestingly, other substitutions in this position, while increasing the rate of development of block did not affect the reversibility of block. It is well established that proline residues act as helix breakers and thus may mediate a more pronounced effect on the local structure of the channel. However, the presence of a proline in this region of the channel per se is not sufficient to render toxin block reversible, since the E1332P construct did not affect recovery from toxin block. The dramatic effects on the reversibility of block seen with the G1326P mutant cannot be explained by a simple change in toxin affinity, since this mutation resulted in only a ∼4-fold increase in the equilibrium dissociation constants of the two toxins as determined from the ratios of unblocking and blocking time constants. Instead, we envision a scenario in which residue Gly1326 restricts the access of the toxin to its docking site (Fig. 7). Once the toxin has docked to its receptor site, the barrier formed by Gly1326 would aid in the stabilization of the channel toxin interaction. Upon mutation of Gly1326 to proline, this barrier may be removed, thereby providing greater access to the blocking site, but concomitantly resulting in a less stable interaction. Substitutions of Gly1326 with other types of amino acid residues may not be as effective in removing the putative access barrier and, hence, affect the time constant for development of block and unblock to a smaller degree. It is more difficult to speculate about the basis for the effects of substitutions in position Glu1332. It is possible that this residue forms a low affinity contact point between the toxin and the channel. Alternatively, changes in this residue may allosterically affect the interaction of the toxin with residue Glu1334, which was previously identified as an important determinant of ω-conotoxin GVIA block (16Ellinor P.T. Zhang J.F. Horne W.A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The change in the time constant of development of block observed with the E1332R and E1332P constructs are unlikely due to a change in net charge of the channel, since neither the double (E1321K,D1323R) nor the R1325E substitution significantly affected toxin block. A major finding is that mutations that affect block of the channel by ω-conotoxin GVIA also affect the action of ω-conotoxin MVIIA. To date, the only evidence suggesting an overlap between the blocking sites for the two toxins had come from competitive binding studies (2Olivera B.M. Miljanich G.P. Ramachandran J. Adams M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 823-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated for the first time at the amino acid level that the two toxins share some of the same channel molecular determinants. The two toxins share a similar disulfide bond arrangement comprised of six conserved cysteine residues, but only about 27% in sequence identity among their non-cysteine residues (2Olivera B.M. Miljanich G.P. Ramachandran J. Adams M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 823-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 34Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Zeikus R. McIntosh J.M. Varga J. Rivier J. de Santos V. Cruz L.J. Science. 1985; 230: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This suggests that one or more of the conserved toxin residues may perhaps interact with residue 1326 on the calcium channels or that the three-dimensional folding of the toxin backbone is a key determinant for blocking action. The latter scenario would fit with the model shown in Fig. 7, which predicts that toxins with an overall similarity in their backbone structure would be similarly affected by the presence/absence of an access barrier. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, our data show that a single amino acid residue in the domain III S5-H5 region is sufficient to control access of two structurally distinct peptides from two different cone snail species, suggesting that the basic mechanism by which these two toxins block channel activity is highly conserved. In summary, our data identify two residues (Gly1326 and Glu1332) in the α1B subunit, which are important determinants of ω-conotoxin block. The G1326P mutant may serve as a convenient tool for further investigation into the detailed mechanisms underlying ω-conotoxin block of N-type calcium channels by allowing direct access to the effects of any additional mutations on the channel or the toxin molecule on both blocking and unblocking kinetics. In view of the clinical use of ω-conotoxin MVIIA as an analgesic (35Ridgeway B. Wallace M. Gerayli A. Pain. 2000; 85: 287-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Penn R.D. Paice J.A.

The 70-kDa heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones that participate in a variety of cellular functions. hsp70 proteins bind hydrophobic stretches on unfolded proteins, aiding in their folding and oligomerization and in translocating proteins across membranes (reviewed in Refs. 1Mayer M.P.

This chaperone function of hsp70 is stimulated by interaction with hsp40 proteins. ATP-bound hsp70 proteins transiently bind hydrophobic stretches on unfolded substrates, and their intrinsic ATPase activity is stimulated by hsp40 proteins, which increases the stability of the hsp70-peptide interaction (1Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). The hsp70-hsp40 interaction is conserved from bacteria to humans (2Boorstein W.R. Ziegelhoffer T. Craig E.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are at least 14 different hsp70 proteins grouped into five defined subclasses. The two cytosolic hsp70 subfamilies, SSA and SSB, share 60% amino acid identity but cannot functionally substitute for one another (2Boorstein W.R. Ziegelhoffer T. Craig E.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The essential SSA subfamily contains four members (referred to collectively as Ssa). Ssa1 and -2 are constitutively expressed, while Ssa3 and -4 are heat-inducible (3Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Ssa is important in the folding and membrane translocation of nascent peptides, nuclear import, microtubule formation, and the transcriptional response to heat shock (1Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Biol.

The Ssb1 and Ssb2 proteins (referred to collectively as Ssb) are associated with ribosomes and appear to function in binding nascent peptides during translation elongation (8Pfund C. Hoyo-Lopez N.

The SSBsubfamily is not essential, but deletion of both members results in a cold-sensitive phenotype (9Nelson R.J. Zeigelhoffer T. Nicloet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). A yeast hsp40 protein, Sis1, is also ribosome-associated (10Zhong T. Arndt K.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1175-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Deletion of SIS1 is lethal, and a yeast strain that expresses a temperature-sensitive Sis1 protein,sis1-85, demonstrates a defect in translation initiation at the nonpermissive temperature (10Zhong T. Arndt K.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1175-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Luke M. Sutton M.A. Arndt K.T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Due to its association with ribosomes, Sis1 has been proposed to function with Ssb (12James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, Sis1 does not stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssb but does stimulate that of Ssa (Ref. 13Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 14Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The temperature sensitivity of sis1–85 is suppressed by a functional deletion of ribosome L39 protein (rpl39/spb2) as well as ribosomal protein L35 (rpl35/sos1), providing further evidence for a translational function for Sis1 (10Zhong T. Arndt K.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1175-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a deletion of rpl39 also suppresses the lethal deletion of another essential translation factor, poly(A)-binding protein (PAB1), suggesting that these proteins functionally interact (15Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Pab1 binds the 3′-terminal poly(A) tract within an mRNA and also plays a role in the stabilization of RNA messages (reviewed in Ref. 16Jacobsen A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Pab1 also serves to bring the 5′- and 3′-ends of mRNA in close proximity by binding the initiation scaffold protein eIF4G (17Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 24: 7168-7177Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This has been shown to be essential for efficient translation initiation as well as mRNA stability (16Jacobsen A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 18Gallie D.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1998; 216: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 19Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). While the functional significance of the genetic relationship betweenPAB1 and SIS1 is unclear, the shared phenotype of Δpab1 and sis1–85 genes suggests a potential interaction between the two in translation initiation. However, as demonstrated here, there is no detectable physical association between Pab1 and Sis1. In contrast, Ssa interacts with both Sis1 and Pab1, and these interactions are specific for the Ssa subfamily of hsp70s. As previously shown for the interaction between hsp40 and hsp70, the interaction of Ssa with Pab1 is mediated via the variable C-terminal domain of Ssa rather than the peptide binding domain (20Demand J. Luders J. Hohfeld J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Like Sis1, Ssa associates with ribosomes, and a temperature-sensitive strain ofSSA (ssa1–45) demonstrates a severe translational defect (10Zhong T. Arndt K.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1175-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Depletion of Ssa decreases the association of Pab1 with eIF4G, suggesting that the translational effect of Ssa is mediated at least in part by its effect on the interaction of these two proteins. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast cultures were grown as indicated using either synthetic medium plus 2% glucose supplemented with the appropriate additives or complete medium (22Becker D. Guarente L. Guthrie C. Fink G. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 182-187Google Scholar). Yeast were grown in the appropriate medium at either 25 or 30 °C to log phase. Where indicated, yeast were shifted to 37 °C by resuspending the cell pellet in prewarmed 37 °C medium and incubated at 37 °C for the prescribed time. For depletion experiments, yeast were grown in complete medium with 2% galactose and then washed three times and shifted to complete medium with 2% glucose for 7 h before harvesting. The URA3 CEN4 plasmids containing the SSA1 and SSB1fusion constructs were previously described (12James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These were transformed into JN54 by standard lithium acetate transformation procedure (22Becker D. Guarente L. Guthrie C. Fink G. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology.

The C-terminal deletion of SSA was created by engineering a stop codon by PCR mutagenesis immediately 3′ to theXhoI site used for construction of the chimeras (12James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A.

Yeast cells from 50 ml of log phase culture were pelleted, treated for 1 min with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Calbiochem), and repelleted. Lysates were made by bead beating the yeast for 4 min, with intermittent cooling on ice, in polysome buffer (PB1; 100 mm KCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 14.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide). This mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 8 min, and the supernatant was removed. 5–10 A254 units were loaded onto a 16.2-ml 10–50% sucrose gradient containing 100 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Lysates were sedimented in a Beckman SW28.1 rotor at 27,000 rpm for 4.5 h. Gradients were collected with continuous monitoring at 254 nm using an ISCO UA-5 absorbance detector and 1640 gradient collector. Samples run over 10–25% gradients were sedimented in a Beckman SW28.1 rotor at 20,000 rpm for 16.5 h. Pellets were resuspended in polysome buffer, and supernatant fractions were either collected as above or pooled where indicated. For cycloheximide treatment of cells, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to the yeast medium concomitant with a shift to 37 °C. RNase treatment of the yeast lysate was performed by adding 300 μg/ml RNase A to the PB, followed by regular lysis. High salt treatment was performed by centrifuging lysates in a sucrose gradient containing 500 mm KCl. For immunoprecipitation from gradient fractions, lysates were centrifuged through a 10–25% sucrose gradient for 16 h at 23,100 rpm. The polysome pellet was washed and resuspended for immunoprecipitation in sucrose gradient buffer. Nonribosomal fractions (fractions 1 and 2) were collected and directly immunoprecipitated. Fractions containing the 40, 60, and 80 S ribosomes were pelleted using an SW50 rotor at 49,700 rpm for 7.5 h. Pellets were washed and resuspended for immunoprecipitation in sucrose gradient buffer. Lysates were made by resuspending cell pellets in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton, 0.01% SDS) and bead beating for 4 min with intermittent cooling on ice.

For immunoprecipitates, samples were boiled for 5 min, and equal amounts of each sample were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in 0.01 m CAPS and 10% methanol using a semidry electroblotter (Owl Scientific, Woburn, MA) at 400 mA for 45 min. Immunoprecipitates from the Ssa and Ssb fusion proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing a 20:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio. These gels were transferred to Immobilon for 45 min at 400 mA. Proteins collected from sucrose gradient fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, washed twice in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, acetone (1:5, v/v), and solubilized by boiling in Laemmli buffer for 5 min. Pellets from 10–25% gradients were resuspended in polysome buffer for immunoprecipitation or in Laemmli buffer. Equal amounts of each fraction were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred as above to Immobilon (Millipore Corp.). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in 1× PBS-T (PBS plus 0.02% Tween 20; Sigma) and probed with the following antibody dilutions in 5% milk, 1× PBS-T: HA-12CA5 (1:2000), PAB 1G1 (1:5000), SSA 1173 (1:2000, except in Figs. 1 E and 2, where a dilution of 1:600 was used), SSB 30733 (1:2000, except in Figs. 1 E and 2, where a dilution of 1:600 was used), GST 1:2000 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), SIS 66932 (1:1000), Hsp70 535 (1:1000; E. Craig, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), or eIF4G (1:1000) (17Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 24: 7168-7177Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Western blots were washed three times for 5 min each in 1× PBS-T. HA-12CA5 and PAB 1G1 antibodies were detected with a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (ICN Biomedical Inc., Aurora, OH), diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk in 1× PBS-T. SSA 1173, SSB 30733, SIS1 66932, Hsp70 535, and eIF4G antibodies were detected with a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cappel, Durham, NC) diluted 1:4000 in 5% milk in 1× PBS-T. GST antibodies were detected with a rabbit anti-goat antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) diluted 1:8000. Western blots were washed as above and developed using chemiluminescence with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA was extracted according to standard procedures from 17 A600 of ssa1–45yeast or wild-type yeast grown at 25 °C and 30 min following shift to 37 °C (22Becker D. Guarente L. Guthrie C. Fink G. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 182-187Google Scholar). Volumes throughout the RNA extraction were kept equivalent so that the final RNA content represented RNA extracted from an equivalent A600 of yeast. Equal volumes of RNA were diluted as indicated in diethylpyrocarbonated-treated water, 50% formamide, 6.5% formaldehyde, 5X SSC, and bound to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) using the Minifold II slot blot apparatus (Schleicher and Schuell). Total mRNA abundance was determined by probing with cDNA made from whole cell RNA fromSSA cells as previously described (22Becker D. Guarente L. Guthrie C. Fink G. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 182-187Google Scholar, 25Hensold J.O. Barth-Baus D. Stratton C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23246-23254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Blots were developed by autoradiography. Four 10-ml cultures ofSSA and ssa1–45 yeast were grown at 25 °C overnight until mid-log phase. At zero time, half of the cultures were centrifuged and resuspended in YEPD prewarmed to 37 °C. At 0, 10, 30, and 60 min, individual cultures were labeled with 10 μCi of [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 min. Triplicate samples of 0.5 ml were removed, an equal volume of ice-cold 25% trichloroacetic acid was added, and the samples were vortexed. Samples were stored on ice for 30 min, and the precipitated proteins were collected onto Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters by vacuum filtration and washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 95% ethanol. Amino acid incorporation into acid-precipitable material was determined by scintillation counting in a Beckman LS6000 SE liquid scintillation counter. Final values were corrected for A600readings. Bacterial strains containing histidine-tagged Pab1 (26Kessler S.H. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), pGEX2TSSA1-RI, or pGEX2T-A1C1ΔB1 (E. Craig, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) were grown overnight at 37 °C. The His-Pab1 was purified as previously described (27Deardorff J.A. Sachs A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were purified as previously described (28Smith D.B. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 4: 220-229Google Scholar) and eluted from glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10 mm glutathione (Sigma). The eluate was incubated with either Talon metal affinity resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) alone or His-Pab1 immobilized on Talon resin for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times in wash buffer (100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μm bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 2 mmimidazole). Samples were then either treated or mock-treated with 2 μg of RNase A for 20 min at 26 °C. Samples were washed twice, and the resin was resuspended in wash buffer with 200 mmimidazole. His-Pab1 was eluted for 15 min at 26 °C, and the eluate was removed. The eluate was separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting. PAB1 and SIS1 share a genetic interaction with RPL39, and their gene products are ribosome-associated proteins that function in translation. Therefore, we investigated whether Pab1 and Sis1 proteins interacted, as determined by coimmunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed from the wild type yeast strain JN54 (herein calledSSA) using either a Pab1 antibody or Sis1 antibody (Fig.1). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot with either the Sis1 (Fig. 1 A) or Pab1 (Fig.1 B) antibodies. Pab1 was not detected in the Sis1 immunoprecipitate, and similarly, Sis1 was not detected in the Pab1 immunoprecipitates. Thus, at the limit of resolution of these immunoprecipitations, Sis1 and Pab1 do not directly interact. hsp40 proteins function together with an hsp70 partner, and interaction between Sis1 and Pab1 may be indirect and mediated via an hsp70 partner. Therefore, coimmunoprecipitation studies were performed to determine whether Sis1 or Pab1 bound either Ssb or Ssa. Immunoprecipitations were performed and analyzed as above using either Sis1 (Fig. 1 A), Pab1 (Fig. 1 B), Ssa-specific (Fig. 1 C), or Ssb-specific antibodies (Fig. 1 D). These experiments demonstrated that Ssa, but not Ssb, coimmunoprecipitated with Sis1, and similarly Pab1 coimmunoprecipitated Ssa but little detectable Ssb. In reciprocal immunoprecipitations, Pab1 coimmunoprecipitated with Ssa but not Ssb (data not shown). To ensure that the differential association of Ssa and Ssb with Pab1 was not due to differences in total abundance of these hsp70 homologues, an aliquot of lysate was analyzed by Western blotting for Ssa and Ssb, concurrent with the Pab1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 E). As demonstrated here, the Pab1-Ssa interaction appears to be 8–10-fold stronger than the Pab1-Ssb interaction (as determined by densitometry) when the total amount of these proteins is taken into account. This preferential binding of Ssa to Pab1 was confirmed by further studies (Fig.2 and data not shown). Thus, there appears to be a specific interaction of Ssa hsp70 proteins with Pab1 and Sis1. To determine whether Pab1 bound all Ssa family members, immunoprecipitations were performed with lysates from strains lacking different family members: SSA; JN49, which lacks Ssa1 and Ssa2 (herein called ssa1ssa2 (29Nelson R.J. Heschl M.F. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1992; 131: 277-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)); and JB67, whose only source of Ssa is a temperature-sensitive SSA1 (herein calledssa1–45) (Fig. 1 F). Pab1 coimmunoprecipitated with Ssa from both the ssa1ssa2 and ssa1–45strains, indicating that Pab1 binds to Ssa family members 1, 3, and 4. Although we do not have definitive data on Ssa2, it is likely that Pab1 also binds this protein. To identify the Pab1 binding site on Ssa, we took advantage of the fact that Pab1 did not bind Ssb and analyzed Ssa/Ssb fusion proteins by immunoprecipitation. Each fusion contains an ATPase domain, a peptide binding domain, and a C-terminal domain from one of these two hsp70 protein subclasses (12James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Each fusion is named for the domains they contain (i.e. AAB contains the ATPase and peptide binding domain from Ssa1 and the variable domain from Ssb1). Pab1 was immunoprecipitated from SSA yeast transformed with one of the six fusion constructs, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot using either Ssa (Fig. 2 A) or Ssb (Fig.2 B) antibodies. As a protein expression control, aliquots of each of the lysates were analyzed by Western blotting (Figs. 2,A, lanes 1–3, and B,lanes 1–4). All six of the fusion proteins, as well as the native hsp70, were expressed to similar levels and were recognized by the appropriate antibody. The variable C-terminal domain of Ssa was necessary and sufficient for Pab1 association, as seen by the coimmunoprecipitation of BBA, and not AAB, with Pab1 (Fig.2 A, lane 6). In contrast, fusion proteins containing the C terminus of Ssb only weakly coimmunoprecipitated with Pab1, despite the fact that all of these proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2 B,lanes 5–8). We assume that the ABA fusion protein also coimmunoprecipitated with Pab1, but because it comigrated with wild type Ssa, the association of ABA with Pab1 could not be assessed (12James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The above experiments demonstrated a specific interaction between the C-terminal domain of Ssa and Pab1 in vivo. To confirm that this was due to a direct interaction between these two proteins and not simply coprecipitation with a common ribonucleoprotein complex, an Ssa C-terminal fragment was fused to GST, expressed in bacteria, purified on a glutathione column, and eluted. As a control, GST was used. Recombinant histidine-tagged Pab1 was purified, and eluates from the GST or GST-Ssa purification were applied to either metal affinity resin alone or metal affinity resin with immobilized Pab1 (Fig.2 C). Additionally, these pull-downs were either treated with RNase A or left untreated. GST alone did not bind to immobilized Pab1, but the C-terminal fragment of Ssa bound Pab1 in the presence or absence of RNase A treatment. In addition, another GST-Ssa fragment, encompassing a shorter C-terminal fragment, also bound to immobilized Pab1 to a similar degree (data not shown). As demonstrated here, the Pab1-Ssa interaction is not dependent on RNA but appears due to a direct protein-protein interaction between Pab1 and Ssa. Additionally, neither the addition of excess poly(A) mRNA to immunoprecipitates nor in vivo depletion of poly(A) mRNA blocks the Ssa-Pab1 association (data not shown). Finally, since Ssa and Pab1 coimmunoprecipitate from cytosolic fractions that do not contain detectable mRNA or ribosomes (see Fig. 4 Band data not shown), the interaction of these two proteins appears direct. Since both Sis1 and Pab1 are ribosome-associated proteins and interact with Ssa, we determined whether Ssa associated with ribosomes. Lysates from SSA yeast were analyzed by sedimentation through 10–50% sucrose gradients, and the distribution of ribosomes in the gradient was determined by absorbance at 254 nm. Proteins were recovered from the fractionated lysate, and the presence of Ssa in the fractions was analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies that recognized Ssa proteins but not Ssb. As seen in Fig.3 A, the Ssa proteins (top panel) were most abundant in the top of the gradient (fractions 1 and 2). However, a significant portion sedimented at the same position as ribosomal subunits and translating polysomes. This is comparable with that seen with Ssb, Sis1, and Pab1 (Fig.3 A, lower panels). Previous experiments suggested that the most rapidly sedimenting Ssa proteins were not bound to ribosomes, since their sedimentation was unaffected by RNase A (12James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Ssa proteins found in the polysome fractions were polysome-associated, lysates fromSSA yeast were treated with RNase A prior to fractionation. This reduced the amount of material that sedimented in polysome fractions and increased the amount in 80 S fractions (Fig. 3, compareA and B). Coincident with this, the amount of Ssa protein was reduced in polysomal fractions, paralleling results for Ssb, Sis1, and Pab1 (Fig. 3 B, lower panels). Thus, under the conditions used here, the rapidly sedimenting Ssa proteins are part of an RNase-sensitive particle. As an independent means of confirming Ssa association with polysomes, strains temperature-sensitive for translation initiation factorsprt1–1 (F294) and eIF4E (cdc33) were utilized (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). Under permissive conditions, Pab1, Sis1, Ssa, and Ssb exhibit a polysomal distribution, similar to that seen in the SSA yeast (data not shown). At the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C for 30 min), both of these strains showed a loss of polysomes and accumulation of 80 S ribosomes. A concomitant loss of Ssa from the polysome fractions was also observed, similar to the results for Pab1, Sis1, and Ssb (Fig. 3 C). Association of Ssa, as well as the other proteins, with polysomes was stable to sedimentation in 500 mm KCl (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that all of these proteins are present on translating ribosomes. The C-terminal domain of Ssa appears required for its interaction with Pab1. To determine whether this domain also mediated Ssa association with polysomes, a C-terminal truncation"

Bangs J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is a homo-hexamer, each subunit having two copies of a conserved ∼200-amino acid ATPase domain containing Walker A (ATP binding) and B (ATP hydrolysis) motifs, and it has NEM-sensitive ATPase activity. Other AAA family members having two conserved ATPase domains include Pex1p and mammalian NSF (Sec18 in yeast) (15Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pex1p is essential for peroxisomal biogenesis in S. cerevisiae (16Erdmann R. Wiebel F.F. Flessau A. Rytka J. Beyer A. Frölich K.-U. Kunau W.H. Cell. 1991; 64: 499-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). NSF plays an essential role in the fusion cycle of transport vesicles with target membranes in many steps of eukaryotic secretory pathways, including endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport, intra-Golgi transport, and synaptic fusion (17Block M.

Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). During the process of vesicle and target membrane fusion, NSF forms a 20 S complex with both SNAPs and membrane-bound SNAREs derived from both the vesicle and target membranes (20Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Subsequent ATP hydrolysis by NSF is believed to mediate conformational changes leading to disassembly of SNARE complexes in post-fusion membranes (19Söllner T. Whitehart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Germanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). The precise functions of VCP are less certain, but given its sequence and structural relationship to NSF, it is believed to play an analogous role in organellar biogenesis via homotypic membrane fusion (8Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.-M. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Malhotra V. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 9Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.-M. Warren G.

Cell. 1995; 82: 885-893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This view is supported by evidence for interactions between VCP homologues and resident SNAREs of the endoplasmic reticulum (21Patel S.K. Indig F.E. Olivieri N. Levine N. Latterich M. Cell. 1998; 92: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,22Roy L. Bergeron J.J.M. Lavoie C. Hendriks R. Gushue J. Fazel A. Pelletier A. Morre D.J. Subramnaniam V.N.

Cell. 1998; 92: 603-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells these interactions are mediated by a soluble adapter protein called p47, which functions analogously to αSNAP in the formation of NSF 20 S complexes (24Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition, a complex of cytosolic proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteasome function (Ufd1) and nuclear import (Npl4) have been shown to physically interact with the VCP homologue p97 (25Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The growing view is that VCP is a multifunctional protein that affects different activities via specific adapter proteins (25Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The commonality of these functions may be the ATP-dependent protein folding/unfolding activity of VCP as has been demonstrated with the archaeal homologue (26Golbik R. Lupas A. Koretke K. Baumeister W. Peters J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Evidence for VCP function in cell cycle control stems from work withS. cerevisiae cdc48-1 mutants that arrest as large budded cells with an undivided nucleus in the bud junction (4Fröhlich K.-U. Fries H.-W. Rudiger M. Erdmann R. Botstein D. Mecke D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Because yeast undergoes closed mitosis, Cdc48p must enter the nucleus to affect its cell cycle-related function(s) and consequently contains a nuclear localization signal (27Madeo F. Schlauer J. Frölich K.-U. Gene. 1997; 204: 9454-9456Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly then, AtCdc48p but not porcine VCP can complement S. cerevisiae cdc48 mutants despite the fact that both plants and animals have open mitosis (6Feiler H.S. Desprez T. Santoni V. Kronenberger J. Caboche M. Trass J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5626-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Madeo F. Schlauer J. Frölich K.-U. Gene. 1997; 204: 9454-9456Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, VCP failed to complement even when deliberately targeted to the yeast nucleus (27Madeo F. Schlauer J. Frölich K.-U. Gene. 1997; 204: 9454-9456Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) suggesting that VCP is unable to interact appropriately with yeast Cdc48p accessory proteins across the fungi:vertebrate phylogenetic divide. The role of ATP hydrolysis in AAA protein function has been addressed by site-specific mutagenesis of individual ATPase domains. Mutations of the Walker A and B motifs in NSF indicate that the first ATPase domain (D1) is responsible for the bulk of the NEM-sensitive ATPase activity and that it is essential for NSF activity in in vitro fusion assays (28Whiteheart S.W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the second domain (D2) had a modest effect on the total ATPase and fusion activities. In contrast, when this same strategy was employed with Pex1p, which functions in peroxisome biogenesis, it was found that the second ATPase domain, but not the first, was essential for activity in vivo (30Krause T. Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To date no such analysis has been performed with any VCP homologue. African trypanosomes are the causative agents of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. Our laboratory studies the cell biology of these parasites focusing on secretory protein trafficking. In this work, we further our previous studies (1Roggy J.L. Bangs J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by performing an in vivo functional analysis of TbVCP. Using a targeted gene disruption strategy we demonstrate that TbVCP is an essential gene for trypanosome viability. The nucleotide hydrolysis motifs of the two ATPase domains are inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis, and regulated expression of these mutants in transgenic trypanosomes is then used to assess the relative contribution of each domain to in vivo TbVCP activity. Our results indicate that the D2 domain is essential for TbVCP function and that the D1 domain, although not itself essential, must augment the D2 domain. Finally, yeast complementation experiments are performed to establish that TbVCP can functionally replace S. cerevisiae Cdc48p. These studies provide novel structure/function information on TbVCP as well as insights into its in vivo functions. Trypanosoma brucei strain 427 procyclic trypanosomes were utilized in targeted gene disruption experiments and for constitutive expression of TbVCP ATP hydrolysis mutants using the pKO vector series or the pXS2neo vector, respectively (see below). Strain 29-13 procyclic trypanosomes (a strain 427 derivative) was used for regulated expression of TbVCPmutants. Strain 29-13 (genotype: TETR, HYG,T7RNAP, NEO) stably expresses the Tet repressor under hygromycin selection and the T7 RNA polymerase under neomycin selection. Transfection of this strain with reporter proteins in the pLew100 vector (see below) allows tetracycline-inducible expression from a procyclin promoter containing the Tet operator sequence (31Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Strain 427 procyclic trypanosomes were maintained in TMP medium at 27 °C as previously reported (32Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). pXS2 and pKO transformants of this strain were selected with 50 μg/ml G418 and/or 25 μg/ml hygromycin. Strain 29-13 was cultured at 27 °C in Cunningham's medium (33Cunningham I. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) with 15% inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, 15 μg/ml G418, and 50 μg/ml hygromycin. pLew100 transformants of strain 29-13 were selected with 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. Trypanosomal DNA was prepared according to the method of Medina-Acosta et al. (34Medina-Acosta E. Cross G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As needed, clonal cell lines were established by limiting dilution in conditioned media (1:1 fresh and spent culture media supplemented to 20% fetal calf serum). Metabolic radiolabeling, immunoprecipitation, and electrophoresis were as previously described (32Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The following synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides were used for PCR. All sequences are from 5′ to 3′. Sequences complementary to the target template are inuppercase, added sequences are in lowercase, restriction sites are underlined, and the altered nucleotide in mutagenic primers is in boldface and italic. Primers for amplification of the 3′-flanking TbVCP genomic targeting sequence were: JB165, aaaaaatctagataaCGCGGCGCTCGTCGCTC, 5′-primer (codons 727–732) with XbaI site; and JB166, aaaaaagagctcCCCCCTCTCACTTTCC, 3′-primer (3′-UTR) withSacI site. Primers for construction of DExx box (DB) mutants were: JB149, GGTAGAGGTGGACCC, 5′-flanking primer (codons 155–160) for DB1 1° and 2° amplification; JB155, GCCGAAGTTTTGGATTCC, 5′-flanking primer (codons 428–433) for DB2 1° and 2° amplification; JB167, ATTTTTATTGAC CAAATAGACTC, 5′-internal primer (codons 290–297) for DB1 1° amplification; JB168, GAGTCTATTT GGTCAATAAAAAT, 3′-internal primer (codons 290–297) for DB1 1° amplification; JB169, CTTCTTCGAT CAACTGGATTCCG, 5′-internal primer (codons 563–571) for DB2 1° amplification; JB170, CGGAATCCAGTT GATCGAAGAAG, 3′-internal primer (codons 563–571) for DB2 1° amplification; JB171, CCCAGTCCACAACGGCC, 3′-flanking primer (codons 416–422) for DB1 1° and 2° amplification; JB172, GACACCGTTCGCTCTTGC, 3′-flanking primer (codons 699–704) for DB2 1° and 2° amplification. A 2410-bp EcoRI/XbaI fragment from pXS2 (35Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) containing 5′-3′: 1) the procyclinEP1-EP2 intergenic region, 2) the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (NEO), and 3) the tubulin βα intergenic region was cloned into the corresponding sites in pBluescript IISK− (pBSIISK−, Stratagene, San Diego CA) to generate pKOneo. Next the NEO cassette was replaced with a hygromycin phosphotransferase gene cassette (HYG) using flanking AscI/PacI sites (a generous gift of Dr. Ian Manger, Stanford University) to create pKOhyg. SpecificTbVCP disruption constructs were assembled by first inserting a 349-bp HindIII/NheI 5′-flankingTbVCP genomic fragment (nucleotides −353 to −10 relative to nucleotide +1 of the TbVCP open reading frame) into corresponding sites in the upstream polylinker portion of the pKO vectors. A 455-bp fragment was then amplified (primers JB165/166) from the 3′-flanking TbVCP genomic region and inserted intoXbaI/SacI sites in the downstream polylinker portion of the pKO vectors. Digestion of these constructs (pKOneoΔvcp and pKOhygΔvcp) withHindIII/SacI releases linear fragments bearing distinct drug selectable markers flanked by homology sequences for complete targeted replacement of the genomic TbVCPalleles. Wild type strain 427 procyclic trypanosomes (TbVCP/TbVCP) were electroporated with eitherHindIII/SacI-digested pKOneoΔvcp (5 μg) or pKOhygΔvcp (50 μg) by standard protocol (35Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Transformants were cultured, and appropriate drug selection was applied on day 2; stable transformants grew out within 2 weeks and heterozygousTbVCP/Δtbvcp lines were cloned by limiting dilution. The double null disruption was attempted by electoporation (n = 5) of a single null clone (TbVCP/Δtbvcp::hyg) with 5 μg of HindIII/SacI-digested pKOneoΔvcp. Wild type trypanosomes were simultaneously electroporated (n = 3) as a positive control. At 2 days, wild-type recipient trypanosomes were selected with G418 (n = 3); and single null recipients were selected with either G418 (n = 1) or G418 and hygromycin (n = 4). ∼3 μg of genomic DNA was separated electrophoretically on 0.8% TAE-agarose gels and then capillary-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Nitropure, Micron Separations, Inc., Westboro, MA). Radiolabeled probe was generated by random priming (High Prime DNA labeling kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) utilizing [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For determination of wild-type genomic organization, the 305-bp pVCP insert (1Roggy J.L. Bangs J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was used as probe template; and for verification of the TbVCP single null disruptions, either the TbVCP 5′-UTR, or theNEO or HYG coding regions were used as probe template. Membranes were prehybridized (QuikHyb, Stratagene, San Diego, CA) for 30 − 60 min at 68 °C followed by a 2-h hybridization at 68 °C. High stringency final wash was 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 60 °C. Hybridization was visualized by autoradiography. TheHincII-KpnI region of the pBSIISK-polylinker was first deleted by digestion and blunt-end religation. A 2459-bpMluI/HincII fragment containing the entireTbVCP gene (83 bp of 5′-UTR, 2343 bp of open reading frame, 33 bp of 3′-UTR) was then blunt-end-cloned from the genomic clone pλ5VCP (1Roggy J.L. Bangs J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) into the EcoRV site of pBSIISK (ΔHincII-KpnI) to generate pTbVCP. TheXhoI-KpnI fragment of pTbVCP was next cloned intoXhoI/KpnI-digested pBSIISK− to generate pTbVCPXK. Primary and secondary PCR reactions for the generation of DExx box (DB) ATPase hydrolysis mutants were performed according to a previous study (36Cormack B. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 8.5.1-8.5.10Google Scholar) utilizing pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Briefly, overlapping primary PCR products were amplified from pλ5VCP in two separate reactions. Each reaction utilized a unique flanking primer and a complementary mutagenic primer to introduce a single altered codon (E → Q) in the overlapping ends of the paired primary products. Secondary reactions utilized 10 ng each of the primary PCR products as templates with the two unique flanking primers. In the secondary reactions, denatured primary products re-anneal at the overlapping ends that contain the mutated codon and are amplified as one contiguous product. This process was performed independently for the twoTbVCP ATPase domains, and each final product was sequenced though the region of PCR amplification to verify that only the desired mutation was generated. For the DB1 mutant, primary PCR reactions were performed utilizing primer combinations JB149/168 and JB167/171; JB167 and JB168 encode the mutated nucleotide. Secondary reactions were performed with JB149 and JB171 as flanking primers. The secondary PCR product was digested withAgeI and XhoI, and the 348-bp internal fragment was inserted into AgeI/XhoI-digested pTbVCP to generate pTbVCP(E294Q). For the DB2 mutant, primary PCR reactions were performed utilizing primer combinations JB155/170 and JB169/172; JB169 and JB170 encode the mutated nucleotide. Secondary reactions were performed with JB155 and JB172 as flanking primers. The secondary PCR product was digested withStyI and NheI, and the 410-bp internal fragment was inserted into NheI/StyI-digested pTbVCPXK. The XhoI/KpnI fragment of pTbVCPXK was then cloned into XhoI/KpnI-digested pTbVCP to generate pTbVCP (E567Q). The same fragment was also cloned intoXhoI/KpnI-digested pTbVCP (E294Q) to generate pTbVCP (E294Q/E567Q), i.e. the DB1/2 double mutant. The insertion of wild-type TbVCP into the constitutive expression vector pXS2neo has been described previously (1Roggy J.L. Bangs J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The entire DB1, DB2, and DB1/2 mutant TbVCPcoding regions were excised from their respective vectors withHindIII/EcoRI and directionally cloned into the corresponding sites of pXS2neo. Likewise, the wild type and mutant coding regions were cloned into theBamHI/HindIII sites of the inducible expression vector pLew100 (31Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids series are designated pXS2:WT, pXS2:DB1, etc., and pLew100:WT, pLew100:DB1, etc. For constitutive expression, both wild-type (TbVCP/TbVCP) and clonal single null (TbVCP/Δtbvcp::hyg) strain 427 trypanosomes were electroporated withBstXI-linearized pXS2:WT (n = 2), pXS2:DB1 (n = 3), pXS2:DB2 (n = 3), or pXS2:DB1/2 (n = 3) by standard protocols (35Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). At 2 days, wild-type recipient trypanosomes were selected with G418, and single null recipients were selected with G418 and hygromycin. The entire experiment was performed twice for the wild-type recipients and three times for the single null recipient. In all cases homologous integration was targeted to the tubulin locus. For inducible expression, strain 29-13 (NEO, HYG) trypanosomes were electroporated with 10 μg ofNotI-linearized pLew100:WT, pLew100:DB1, pLew100:DB2, or pLew100:DB1/2 by a modification of the standard protocol. After electroporation the cells were transferred to 10 ml of conditioned TMP media (1:1 fresh TMP and spent TMP supplemented to 20% fetal calf serum) containing G418 (15 μg/ml) and hygromycin (50 μg/ml). Transformants were selected on day 1 with phleomycin (2.5 μg/ml). Viable transformants grew out in 2 weeks and were maintained initially in conditioned media, and then in Cunningham's medium. In this system homologous integration is targeted into the nontranscribed ribosomal RNA spacer, a transcriptionally silent region of the trypanosome genome (37Rudenko G. Blundell P.A. Taylor M.C. Kieft R. Borst P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5470-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For induction of mutant TbVCP expression, tetracycline was added to log phase cultures at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Wild type and mutant TbVCP cell cultures were seeded at 106/ml and induced with tetracycline. Cells were harvested at 36–40 h post-induction, washed, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml) as described previously (1Roggy J.L. Bangs J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axioplan IIi at 100× magnification. Differential interference contrast, and fluorescence images were collected digitally and merged using OpenLabs 2.2 software (Improvision Inc., Lexington, MA). The yeast expression vector pFL61 (2μ plasmid) (38Minet M. Dufour M.-E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) containing the AtCDCc48 cDNA in the sense (pAtCdc48s) and antisense orientations (pAtCdc48αs) (6Feiler H.S. Desprez T. Santoni V. Kronenberger J. Caboche M. Trass J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5626-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Sebastian Bednarek (University of Wisconsin-Madison), as was the haploid S. cerevisiae strain MLY2006 (ts cdc48-2 ura3-52) (21Patel S.K. Indig F.E. Olivieri N. Levine N. Latterich M. Cell. 1998; 92: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To generate sense (pTbVCPs) and antisense (pTbVCPαs) constructs for expression in yeast the TbVCP-containing MluI/HincII genomic fragment was blunt-end-ligated into pFL61, and clones in both orientations were selected. Strains MLY2006 was transformed with each construct by the LiAc, polyethylene glycol transformation method (39Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ura+ transformants were selected on synthetic minimal media minus uracil at the permissive temperature (24 °C). The Ura+ transformants were restreaked onto separate YPD plates and incubated at either the permissive or the non-permissive temperatures (37 °C). To confirm the identity of the plasmids that complemented the conditional growth defects of MLY2006, the pTbVCPs construct was re-isolated according to a previous method (40Hoffman C. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). The isolated plasmid was verified by restriction enzyme mapping and subsequently retransformed into MLY2006 and challenged at the non-permissive temperature. In addition, positive transformants were restreaked onto synthetic minimal media containing 0.005% uracil (Sigma), 0.1% 5-fluoro-orotic acid (Sigma) to cause selective loss of the URA3-containing construct. Isolated colonies that grew on FOA were then restreaked onto YPD media and incubated at the non-permissive temperature. We wished to determine ifTbVCP is essential for trypanosome viability by a targeted gene disruption strategy. As trypanosomes are obligate diploids in which genes are often found in tandem chromosomal arrays (41Boothroyd J.C. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 3. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1989: 216-230Google Scholar, 42Tschudi C. Ullu E. Infect. Agents Dis. 1994; 3: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar), it was first necessary to define TbVCP genomic organization. The TbVCP genomic locus was mapped by restriction analysis (Fig. 1 A), and representative single digests with endonucleases that cut once in and around theTbVCP coding region are presented in Fig. 1 B. Each enzyme produces a single hybridizing band of unique size (exceptClaI and KpnI), suggesting that theTbVCP gene"

Membrane permeabilization is inefficient if the sterol is embedded within bilayers prepared from phosphatidylcholine only but is greatly enhanced if the target membrane also contains ceramide. Although the enhancement of VCC action is stereospecific with respect to cholesterol, we show here that no such specificity applies to the two stereocenters in ceramide; all four stereoisomers of ceramide enhanced VCC activity in cholesterol-containing bilayers. A wide variety of ceramide analogs were as effective asd-erythro-ceramide, as was diacylglycerol, suggesting that the effect of ceramide exemplifies a general trend of lipids with a small headgroup to augment the activity of VCC. Incorporation of these cone-shaped lipids into cholesterol-containing bilayers also gave similar effects with streptolysin O, another cholesterol-specific but structurally unrelated cytolysin. In contrast, the activity of staphylococcal α-hemolysin, which does not share with the other toxins the requirement for cholesterol, was far less affected by the presence of lipids with a conical shape. The collective data indicate that sphingolipids and glycerolipids do not interact with the cytolysins specifically. Instead, lipids that have a conical molecular shape appear to effect a change in the energetic state of membrane cholesterol that in turn augments the interaction of the sterol with the cholesterol-specific cytolysins.

The specificity for cholesterol is shared between Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC)1 (1Ikigai H. Akatsuka A. Tsujiyama H. Nakae T. Shimamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and streptolysin O (SLO) (2Prigent D. Alouf J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 443: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Otherwise, these toxins are not related, and the oligomeric pores they form are very different in size and morphology (1Ikigai H. Akatsuka A. Tsujiyama H. Nakae T. Shimamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Sziegoleit A. Infect. Immun. 1985; 47: 52-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although with SLO the sterol is already required in the initial event of membrane binding of the monomeric toxin (4Alouf J.E. Geoffroy C. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 147-186Google Scholar), it only comes into play at the stage of oligomerization in the case of VCC (5Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T. Biermann C. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Zitzer A. Harris R. Kemminer S.E. Zitzer O. Bhakdi S. Muething J. Palmer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When the sterol is incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers at physiologically realistic concentrations (i.e. up to 40% by mol), these membranes do not become significantly sensitive to VCC. However, it was previously found that membrane susceptibility toward the cytolysin was greatly enhanced by inclusion of ceramide; free ceramide and monohexosyl ceramides proved similarly effective (7Zitzer A. Zitzer O. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A combined specificity for cholesterol and sphingolipids has previously been shown for the fusion protein of Semliki Forest virus. In that instance, the interaction with ceramide proved to be highly stereoselective (8Moesby L. Corver J. Erukulla R.K. Bittman R. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10319-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Wilschut J. Corver J. Nieva J.L. Bron R. Moesby L. Reddy K.C. Bittman R. Mol. Membr.

Accordingly, we have examined the structural properties of the ceramide molecule responsible for the sensitization of membranes to VCC. To our surprise, no dependence on stereospecific features of ceramide could be detected. Membrane sensitization was readily achieved with a variety of synthetic ceramides and even with 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol, which is not closely related in structure to ceramide. However, with both sphingo- and glycerolipids, the presence of a phosphocholine headgroup led to a decrease in membrane susceptibility toward VCC. In glycerolipids other than PC and diacylglycerol, headgroups smaller in size than phosphocholine were associated with higher membrane susceptibility to the cytolysin. Among lipid species sharing the same headgroup, a complementary trend was generally apparent in which acyl chains having a large cross-section were associated with higher VCC activity, although there were significant exceptions to this correlation. Remarkably, despite its lack of a structural homology with VCC, SLO was affected in its activity toward cholesterol-containing bilayers in a very similar way by the incorporation of sphingo- and glycerolipids into the bilayer. We propose that the effects of sphingo- and glycerolipids on membrane susceptibility to VCC and SLO do not arise because of any direct, specific effect upon the toxins but instead are mediated by their ability to enhance the interaction of cholesterol with the toxins. VCC and α-hemolysin were purified from bacterial culture supernatants as described previously (5Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T. Biermann C. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J.

The reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue was dissolved in 1 ml of a 25% solution of ethyl acetate in hexanes, which was loaded onto a silica gel column (10 × 100 mm). The column was eluted with 100 ml of 25% ethyl acetate in hexanes and then with 200 ml of ethyl acetate.

Into a 5-ml round-bottomed flask was charged 300 mg (1.5 mmol) of sodium heptanesulfonate and 2.0 ml of thionyl chloride. A single drop of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide was added, and the solution was heated to reflux under argon for 5 h. The unreacted thionyl chloride was removed by distillation under argon. The residue was dissolved in 5 ml of anhydrous diethyl ether, and the solution was filtered through sea sand. The resulting solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to providen-heptanesulfonyl chloride as a clear yellow oil.

The lipids were dissolved in chloroform and mixed at the molar ratios indicated under “Results” (total amount, 5 mg) and dried with nitrogen in a round-bottom flask to form a thin film. The lipids were resuspended in 10 mm HEPES/100 mm NaCl/50 mm calcein (pH 7.5) by warming, if necessary, and bath sonication. The suspensions were frozen and thawed and then repeatedly extruded through polycarbonate membranes (Nuclepore; pore size 100 nm) using a 10-ml thermobarrel extruder (Lipex, Vancouver, Canada). The non-entrapped calcein was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G50 in 10 mm HEPES/10 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). The lipid concentration of the final liposome suspension was quantified by using a commercial enzymatic assay of cholesterol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). From a solution of the cytolysin in question (200 μg/ml in HEPES/NaCl with 0.1% bovine serum albumin), 2-fold serial dilutions were prepared. To each dilution, an equal volume of the respective preparation of calcein liposomes (total lipid content, 0.2 mg/ml) was added. Following incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the samples were diluted into 30 volumes of HEPES/NaCl, and the calcein fluorescence was assayed in a SPEX Fluorimax fluorometer (excitation wavelength, 488 nm; emission, 520 nm). The extent of calcein release was calculated from the relative increase of fluorescence intensity over a sample of untreated liposomes, whereby the fluorescence intensity corresponding to 100% permeabilization was assayed on a sample lysed with sodium deoxycholate (final concentration, 6 mm). The amounts of toxin required for 25 or 50% release of calcein (RD25 or RD50, respectively) were determined from plots of permeabilizationversus toxin dosage by linear interpolation from the two adjacent data points. Liposomes were prepared from C12- and C20-ceramide, respectively (molar content, 30%), cholesterol (35%), EYPC (32%), and EYPG (2%), and the fluorescently labeled phospholipid (16-indolyl-palmitoyl)- oleoyl-PC (1%; total amount of lipids, 200 nmol). Parallel samples contained the quenching lipid (16-Br-palmitoyl)-oleoyl-PC instead of EYPC. The LUV were assayed for fluorescence (wavelengths were as follows: excitation, 280 nm; emission, 320 nm) in HEPES/NaCl buffer. An aliquot of each sample was dissolved with 10 volumes of methanol; the fluorescence intensity of this sample was used to normalize the intensity of the undissociated sample. The decrease in fluorescence intensity by the quenching lipid with C12- and C20-ceramide, respectively, was then determined from the normalized values. The assay was performed likewise with dipalmitoyl-PE and dilauroyl-PE in place of C20- and C12-ceramide, respectively. Sheep erythrocytes were made up to 20% (by volume) with 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0. They were incubated for 40 min at 30 °C with 2,5, or 10 milliunits/ml sphingomyelinase (Bacillus cereus; EC3.1.4.12; Sigma). They were then washed three times with the former buffer (without CaCl2 and MgCl2) by centrifugation. After resuspension to 2%, VCC was added to 1.5 μg/ml. Hemolysis was followed over time by cell turbidity (A600). In a previous study, it was found that addition of ceramide to PC bilayers containing cholesterol (35% by mol) enhanced VCC-induced permeabilization (7Zitzer A. Zitzer O. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine the structural features of the ceramide molecule responsible for this sensitizing action, we tested a variety of synthetic ceramide derivatives. Fig. 1 shows the structures of the synthetic ceramide analogs we used. The ceramides were added to 20 mol % to give a uniform background mixture of lipids comprising cholesterol (35 mol %), EYPG (2 mol %), and EYPC (making up the remainder to 100 mol %). From these lipid mixtures liposomes loaded with the aqueous fluorescent marker calcein were prepared as described previously (7Zitzer A. Zitzer O. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the release of calcein was determined as a function of VCC concentration. Fig. 2 Ashows that replacement of thed-erythro-ceramide (which represents the physiological configuration) by thel-erythro, d-threo, orl-threo isomer does not cause a major change in liposome membrane susceptibility, indicating that there is no stereospecific interaction between ceramide and VCC. The dosages of VCC required to induce the release of calcein to 50% (RD50) or 25% (RD25) were calculated to provide a concise estimate of the effect of various lipids on membrane susceptibility to VCC. Fig. 2 B gives the RD50values obtained with further molecular modifications in ceramide structure. It is evident that changing the stereochemistry of the C4=C5 double bond of the sphingoid chain from trans tocis or its replacement by a triple bond, a cyclopropyl group, or even a benzene ring does not significantly change the activity of VCC. This finding is in clear contrast to the known role of the double bond in the support of viral fusion (10Corver J. Moesby L. Erukulla R.K. Reddy K.C. Bittman R. Wilschut J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3220-3223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17He L. Byun H.S. Smit J. Wilschut J. Bittman R. J. Am. Chem.

Schmidt R.R. Spiegel S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 451-457PubMed Google Scholar) and in the induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells (14Jarvis W.D. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Martin H.A. Kramer L.B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, reversing the positions of the amido and secondary hydroxy functionalities or replacement of the amide bond with a sulfonamide group do not have major effects on the activity of VCC either. Fig. 2 B also shows that even 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol brings about a similarly strong sensitization as do the ceramides. Thus, if ceramide and dioleoylglycerol share a common mode of action, the stereochemical features of either molecule are surely not important. It was previously found that sphingomyelin was less effective than ceramide in sensitizing membranes to VCC, suggesting an inhibitory role of the phosphocholine headgroup (7Zitzer A. Zitzer O. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The finding that diacylglycerol is more effective than PC indicates that the phosphocholine moiety is inhibitory not only in sphingolipids but also in glycerolipids. In mixed lipid bilayers with cholesterol, the headgroups of phospholipids are thought to shield the steroid ring system of cholesterol from water (21Huang J. Feigenson G.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2142-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Cholesterol shielded from water might then also be shielded from VCC, which may account for the inhibitory effect of the phosphocholine headgroup. In comparisons of cholesterol solubility in PC and PE bilayers, it was proposed that PC, because of its larger headgroup, would make a more efficient “umbrella” for the sterol than PE (22Huang J. Buboltz J.T. Feigenson G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The effect of phospholipid headgroup size on the activity of VCC was examined with the dioleoyl species of the following glycerophospholipids: phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, PE, N-methyl-PE, andN,N′-dimethyl-PE. A plot of the RD25values of VCC observed with these lipids (at 20 mol %) against their theoretical headgroup volumes (Fig.3 A) shows a clear relationship between phospholipid headgroup volume and cytolysin dosage (i.e. an inverse relationship of headgroup volume and membrane susceptibility), which is consistent with the umbrella concept. Another way to increase the “umbrella-shielded space” available to the sterol would be to decrease the cross-sectional area of the fatty acyl chains. The variation of membrane susceptibility to VCC on changing the acyl chain cross-section was evaluated with various synthetic PEs. The results are shown in Fig. 3 B. Clearly, dilauroyl-PE and dimyristoyl-PE have a lower sensitizing effect than dioleoyl-PE, which in turn is exceeded by diphytanoyl-PE, a synthetic lipid with multiple methyl branches and hence particularly bulky acyl chains (phytanic acid:3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid). This direct relation of acyl chain cross-section and membrane susceptibility to VCC is also consistent with the umbrella model. However, dimyristoyl-PE (as well as dipalmitoyl-PE; not shown) also have longer acyl chains than dilauroyl-PE, yet are slightly less effective than the latter. The effect of acyl chain length was also studied with ceramides (Fig. 3 C). A direct relationship between acyl chain length and membrane susceptibility was maintained fromN-acetyl-sphingosine to the N-lauroyl derivative. However, when the chain length was increased further (at 20 mol % ceramide), membrane susceptibility to VCC decreased. A regular relationship between the fatty acyl chain length and membrane susceptibility can only be expected if homogeneous mixing is assumed to take place for all of the lipid species present in the membrane bilayer. However, both glycerolipids (23Hong-wei S. McConnell H. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 24Dorfler H.D. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 1990; 31: 1-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and ceramides (25Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17562-17570Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 26Holopainen J.M. Lehtonen J.Y. Kinnunen P.K.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1997; 88: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) may undergo lateral phase separation. Lipid molecules bearing long, highly saturated acyl chains are particularly prone to undergo segregation within the bilayer, which might explain the decrease of membrane susceptibility with ceramide acyl chain length increasing beyond 12 carbons. Liposomes containing 30 mol % of C12-ceramide or C20-ceramide were examined using a fluorescence-quenching assay of lipid phase separation. These liposomes also included two labeled PC species, the fluorescent compound (16-indolyl-palmitoyl)-oleoyl-PC, and the fluorescence-quenching species (16-bromo-palmitoyl)-oleoyl-PC. In similar experiments involving cerebrosides, this pair of probes was found to display enhanced fluorescence quenching on phase separation, which was ascribed to their cosegregation into the cerebroside-depleted phase (27Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3398-3408Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity was indeed more strongly quenched with C20-ceramide, the relative intensity being 70% with respect to C12-ceramide. This suggests that C20-ceramide does not mix ideally in the bilayer and segregates more readily than C12-ceramide. Segregation of C20-ceramide into ceramide-rich regions would lower the effective concentration of this lipid that is available for interactions with other membrane components and may therefore account for the lower degree of membrane sensitization effected by C20-ceramide. Similarly, dipalmitoyl-PE appeared to undergo phase separation more readily than dilauroyl-PE (the relative fluorescence being 0.75 in this case), which may likewise account for the lower membrane susceptibility observed with dipalmitoyl-PE. Lateral segregation of a lipid sparingly soluble in the bulk phase of the membrane is less likely to occur when its concentration is decreased. Fig. 3 C shows that, indeed, C16- and C20-ceramides are slightly more active than C12-ceramide at 5 mol %. The finding of significant membrane susceptibility to VCC with such low levels of ceramide is quite remarkable in its own right; similar observations were made with the most effective of the glycerolipids tested, dioleylglycerol (data not shown). The data support the notion that the molecular shape of the lipid influences the activity of VCC on the target membrane. Lipids that have a conical molecular shape, i.e. those whose hydrophobic moiety occupies a larger cross-section than does the polar headgroup, enhance membrane susceptibility to VCC. That this effect may be significant not only with synthetic but also with natural membranes is exemplified in Fig. 3 D. With sheep erythrocytes, enzymatic conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide strongly enhances VCC-mediated hemolysis. We propose that the putative mode of action of ceramides and glycerolipids is an indirect one; they change the state of membrane cholesterol and only thereby alter the activity of VCC, which depends on cholesterol. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of ceramides and of glycerolipids on another cholesterol-specific toxin. SLO belongs to a class of cholesterol-specific toxins (4Alouf J.E. Geoffroy C. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 147-186Google Scholar) that are not at all structurally similar to VCC. Fig.4 A shows that, indeed, SLO is affected by the presence of ceramides in the target membranes in a fashion that closely resembles VCC. This is also found with neutral glycerolipids, whereas with acidic glycerolipids the relationship is somewhat different (Fig. 4 B). Finally, Fig. 4 Ccompares the respective efficacy of the two toxins with all the liposomes that were tested with both VCC and SLO. As the lipids we used vary considerably in structure (comprising ceramides, neutral and charged glycerolipids, and even cholesteryl acetate; see below), the correlation coefficient of 0.73 is significant. For comparison, we examined a cholesterol-independent toxin, staphylococcal α-hemolysin. It is evident that in this case the correlation with VCC is much weaker, which suggests that lipid molecular shape is not as important a determinant of the activity of staphylococcal α-hemolysin. In the absence of any ceramides or glycerolipids, both VCC and SLO are still highly active when the concentration of membrane cholesterol is raised from 35 to 55 mol % (data not shown). A very similar effect can be obtained by supplementation of 35 mol % cholesterol with 20 mol % cholesteryl acetate. However, cholesteryl acetate is a very poor substitute of cholesterol as a specific ligand for SLO or VCC (data not shown), because the 3-β-hydroxy group is an important determinant of stereospecificity with both VCC (1Ikigai H. Akatsuka A. Tsujiyama H. Nakae T. Shimamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and SLO (2Prigent D. Alouf J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 443: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Watson K.C. Kerr E.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 140: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This suggests that the sensitizing effect of supplementation of the cholesterol content does not involve stereospecific interaction between the toxins and the additional sterol. The present results do not confirm our previous proposal that VCC displays a dual specificity for cholesterol and ceramide (7Zitzer A. Zitzer O. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to the fusion protein of Semliki Forest virus, which truly displays such dual specificity (8Moesby L. Corver J. Erukulla R.K. Bittman R. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10319-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Nieva J.L. Bron R. Corver J. Wilschut J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2797-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), VCC is not significantly affected even by major structural alterations in the ceramide molecule. Nevertheless, ceramides and some glycerolipids strongly augment the activity of VCC, up to several hundred times, in the presence of modest membrane concentrations of cholesterol. Lee et al. (30Lee Y.C. Taraschi T.F. Janes N. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) studied the impact of various headgroups on bilayer stability in binary mixtures of PE and the respective phospholipid in question; the mixed membranes were monitored for hexagonal-II phase transition. It is instructive to compare their results with the effects of the same lipids on cytolysin activity (Fig.5). With all cytolysins examined, there is a correlation between the ability of lipids to promote the hexagonal-II phase and cytolysin activity. Because α-hemolysin is not strictly dependent on cholesterol, there may be a non-cholesterol-specific component in the effect of bilayer stability on pore-forming toxins. Such a component would be in agreement with recent findings on aerolysin, which, like α-hemolysin, does not strictly require membrane cholesterol, although those results are not directly comparable in quantitative terms (31Alonso A. Goni F.M. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14019-14024Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the correlation between the phase transition temperature and toxin activity is much steeper and much more consistent with the two cholesterol-specific toxins than with α-hemolysin (Fig. 5). This finding strongly suggests that the sterol participate in the observed modulation of toxin activity. How, then, is cholesterol linked to bilayer stability? Like all of the activating lipids, cholesterol is a cone-shaped lipid,i.e. it claims space in the hydrophobic layer but does not provide for adequate headgroup coverage, which it must borrow from adjacent lipids. Thus, cholesterol molecules within a bilayer compete with all other cone-shaped molecules for headgroup coverage, no matter whether these are glycerolipids, sphingolipids, different sterols, or other cholesterol molecules. The latter case occurs in membranes with high cholesterol content. Shortage of headgroup coverage will expose the sterol to an energetically unfavorable state; as a consequence, the free energy of cholesterol is likely to rise steeply with its membrane concentration (21Huang J. Feigenson G.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2142-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Eventually, cholesterol will dissociate from the bilayer and precipitate, which takes place more readily with PE than with PC bilayers (22Huang J. Buboltz J.T. Feigenson G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), in accordance with the notion that PC makes a better umbrella for the sterol (21Huang J. Feigenson G.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2142-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The binding sites of cytolysins may offer another opportunity for cholesterol molecules to seek shelter from the unfavorable contact with water. To the extent that the sterol is closely embraced by the cytolysin, cholesterol will in effect leave the bilayer and hence get rid of the associated chemical potential. Thus, the tighter the interaction between the sterol and the protein, the more sensitive the protein becomes to the cholesterol free energy, and, in turn, to the thermodynamic stability of the bilayer. The proposed model rationalizes the effects of a wide variety of lipids and of variations in the cholesterol concentration (32Ohno Iwashita Y. Iwamoto M. Ando S. Iwashita S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) under a single common principle. It may also accommodate the previous finding that, at constant lipid composition, VCC is more active in small unilamellar vesicles than in LUV (7Zitzer A. Zitzer O. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), because membrane curvature also preferentially strains the headgroup layer. Finally and importantly, there is no reason why the proposed mechanism of indirect activation by cone-shaped lipids should be restricted to bacterial toxins. Any other membrane-associated protein possessing a specific binding site for cholesterol may also be affected by alterations of the cholesterol chemical potential in a similar manner. In this context, it is noteworthy that ceramide and diacylglycerol are particularly effective activators of VCC and SLO. These lipids are both generated in the cytoplasmic membrane by phospholipases and act as messenger molecules by binding to specific acceptor proteins. However, the major fraction of these lipids will remain dispersed in the membrane, where they accordingly should increase the free energy of cholesterol. Because various membrane proteins, e.g. receptors for oxytocin or acetylcholine, are endowed with specific binding sites for cholesterol (33Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 34Corbin J. Wang H.H. Blanton M.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4065-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), this raises the intriguing possibility that cholesterol may function as a second messenger to diacylglycerol and/or ceramide within the cytoplasmic membrane. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that the proposed hypothesis needs to be tested by direct measurements of the chemical potential of cholesterol in mixed lipid bilayers. So far, however, it appears that there is no reliable method for this test. Because spontaneous partitioning of cholesterol between vesicles of different composition is slow (36Rodrigueza W.V. Wheeler J.J. Klimuk S.K. Kitson C.N. Hope M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6208-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37Fugler L. Clejan S. Bittman R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1984; 259: 10823-10826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the sterol may not reach equilibrium before other lipid species start to mix by fusion or redistribution. Although methyl- and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin catalyze depletion of cholesterol from membranes or its insertion into them (39Ohvo H. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8018-8024Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 40Kilsdonk E.P. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), cyclodextrins may interact directly with membrane lipids and may thus alter the energetic state of the membrane-associated sterol. In conclusion, the present study shows that the activity of cholesterol-specific bacterial cytolysins on mixed bilayers may be strongly enhanced by lipids other than cholesterol. It provides evidence that these accessory lipids do not act upon the toxins specifically but instead modulate the interaction of the toxins with cholesterol. The proposed mode of coupling between cholesterol and cone-shaped lipids within mixed bilayers may be of broad interest, because it could similarly apply to the regulation of cellular membrane proteins endowed with cholesterol binding sites,e.g. hormone or neurotransmitter receptors.

Uracil is removed from DNA by uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), the first enzyme in the uracil excision repair pathway. We recently reported that the Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) facilitated uracil excision from certain structured substrates by E. coli UDG (EcoUDG) and suggested the existence of interaction between SSB and UDG. In this study, we have made use of the chimeric proteins obtained by fusion of N- and C-terminal domains of SSBs from E. coli andMycobacterium tuberculosis to investigate interactions between SSBs and UDGs. The EcoSSB or a chimera containing its C-terminal domain interacts with EcoUDG in a binary (SSB-UDG) or a ternary (DNA-SSB-UDG) complex. However, the chimera containing the N-terminal domain from EcoSSB showed no interactions with EcoUDG. Thus, the C-terminal domain (48 amino acids) of EcoSSB is necessary and sufficient for interaction with EcoUDG. The data also suggest that the C-terminal domain (34 amino acids) of MtuSSB is a predominant determinant for mediating its interaction withMtuUDG. The mechanism of how the interactions between SSB and UDG could be important in uracil excision repair pathway has been discussed.

Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG)1 excises uracil residues from DNA and prevents mutations from arising to maintain genomic integrity. The UDG-directed base excision repair pathway has been shown to involve at least five proteins, UDG, AP endonuclease IV, RecJ, DNA polymerase I, and DNA ligase, and to utilize the single nucleotide gap-filling activity (1Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The highly inefficient excision of uracil from structured substrates led to a proposal that melting of such structures may facilitate efficient repair (2Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3737-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We subsequently showed that the inclusion of Escherichia coli SSB (EcoSSB) in the reactions augmented uracil release from the structured substrates by E. coli UDG (EcoUDG; Ref. 3Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2336-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The KMnO4 footprint and Tm analyses showed that SSB melted the hairpin substrates (3Kumar N.V.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recently, we cloned and purified SSB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtuSSB; Ref. 5Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Its biochemical characterization revealed that it is similar to EcoSSB in its oligomerization status and various DNA binding properties (5Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, inclusion of MtuSSB in the reactions led to a decrease in uracil excision by EcoUDG (4Purnapatre K. Handa P. Venkatesh J. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, it appeared that the effect of SSB on uracil release from a structured substrate by EcoUDG was not merely a consequence of melting of the structured substrate. The binary (SSB-UDG) or the ternary interaction (DNA-SSB-UDG) may also influence the activity of UDG. Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) are members of an important class of proteins that play an essential role in various DNA transactions (6Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). EcoSSB, the archetype of the prokaryotic SSBs, is a homotetramer consisting of monomeric subunits of 177 amino acids (7Weiner J. Bertsch L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1972-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary structure prediction suggests thatEcoSSB can be divided into two parts, an N-terminal domain (∼120 amino acids) rich in α-helices and β-sheets and a C-terminal domain (∼60 amino acids) having no defined structure (8Sancar A.

Tsukihara T. Yasuoka N. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 127: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Studies with EcoSSB N-terminal fragments obtained by cleavage at Arg115 by trypsin (SSBT) or at Trp135 by chymotrypsin (SSBC) have established that the N-terminal domain is responsible for tetramerization and DNA binding (10Williams K.R. Spicer E.K. LoPresti M.B. Guggenheimer R.A. Chase J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3346-3355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal region has been suggested to be important in the interaction of SSBs with various proteins in E. coli (11Curth U. Genschel J. Urbanke C. Greipel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2706-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The human homolog of single-stranded DNA-binding protein, replication protein A, was shown to interact with XPF-ERCC1 and participate in the nucleotide excision repair pathway (12Matsunaga T. Park C.H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). More recently, replication protein A has been shown to interact with human UDG and participate in the uracil excision repair pathway (13Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Singh K.K. Keshav K.F. Skorpen F.

However, there are no reports wherein the prokaryotic SSBs have been shown to interact with UDGs or any other DNA glycosylases. M. tuberculosis continues to be the pathogen that causes most casualties worldwide. To develop new means to control this pathogen, it is important to understand the biology of this organism. Because of the high G+C contents of its genome (15Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Bashama D.

In this report, we have studied the interaction between UDGs and SSBs from E. coli and M. tuberculosis, and we show that the C-terminal domain of SSB mediates interaction with UDG, both in the absence and presence of DNA. The native and the chimeric SSBs (EcoSSB, MtuSSB,MtuEcoSSB, and EcoMtuSSB) were purified by the method already described (5Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Handa P. Acharya N. Thanedar S. Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Purification of EcoUDG andMtuUDG was carried out as described previously (4Purnapatre K. Handa P. Venkatesh J. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Handa P. Roy S. Varshney U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17324-17331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were estimated by modified Bradford's dye binding assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (18Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar), analyzed by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS under reducing conditions, and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). 10 pmol of a hairpin substrate, Loop-U2, containing uracil in the second position of the tetra loop, 5′-CTAGAGGATCCTUTTGGATCCT-3′, was 5′ end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and purified using Sephadex G-50 minicolumns (2Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3737-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 3Kumar N.V. Varshney U.

For assays, 1 pmol of Loop-U2 (20,000 cpm) was incubated in the presence or absence of 5 pmol of the various SSB tetramers in UDG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmNa2EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and treated with UDG (0.4, 4, or 40 fmol) at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 5 μl of 0.2m NaOH, heated at 90 °C for 10 min, dried in the Speed Vac (Savant), and dissolved in 10 μl of formamide dye (80% formamide, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF and bromphenol blue, and 1 mm Na2EDTA). Aliquots (5 μl) were analyzed on 18% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the bands corresponding to substrate and product were quantitated by a Bioimage Analyzer (Fuji). Control reactions were treated exactly in a similar manner, except that no protein was added. Loop-U2 (1 pmol, 20,000 cpm) was incubated with 5 pmol of SSBs or ribosome recycling factor (EcoRRF) 2A. R. Rao and U. Varshney, unpublished data. in UDG buffer for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with 5 μl of 0.2 n NaOH and processed for the detection of the uracil excision activity as above. The yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed using the HIS3 and β-galactosidase reporter systems (16Handa P. Acharya N. Thanedar S. Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The open reading frames corresponding to EcoSSB,MtuSSB, EcoUDG, and MtuUDG were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the respective pTrc99C based constructs, using forward (5′-GGAATTCCACAGGAAACAGACCAT-3′) and reverse (5′-CTTTGATCATCCGCCAAAACAGCC-3′) primers and Pfu DNA polymerase. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested withEcoRI and PstI enzymes and cloned into the corresponding sites of pGBT9 and pGAD424 vectors. The recombinants were verified by restriction analyses and nucleotide sequencing. The SSBs (10 pmol) were incubated with 1 pmol (20,000 cpm) of a 27-mer single-stranded oligomer, 5′-CACCTGTATCATATTCGTCGGCGAGCT-3′ (16Handa P. Acharya N. Thanedar S. Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), with or without UDG (20 pmol) for 30 min in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and separated on a native polyacrylamide (8%) gel (30:0.5, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) using 0.5× Tris borate-Na2EDTA buffer for 1–2 h at 150 V (∼8 V·cm−1) at 4 °C. The complex and the free DNA bands were visualized by autoradiography (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Loop-U2 (1 pmol, 2 × 105 cpm) was incubated with MtuEcoSSB orEcoMtuSSB (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10, or 15 pmol of the tetramer) in the binding buffer and analyzed by native polyacrylamide gels as in EMSA detailed above. The SSB-DNA complex and free DNA were quantified on a Bioimage Analyzer (Fuji), and the percentage of complex formed was plotted against the amounts of SSB in the reaction. Proteins (MtuSSB, EcoSSB, MtuEcoSSB, EcoMtuSSB,EcoRRF, EcoUDG, and MtuUDG) were electrophoresed on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS under reducing conditions and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.45 μm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by electroblotting (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The transfer was carried out for 3 h at 200 mA. The membranes were blocked overnight with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), washed with TBS, and overlaid with EcoUDG or MtuUDG (100 μg) in 7 ml of TBS for 2 h. After washing three times with TBS, the membranes were incubated with antibodies against EcoUDG or MtuUDG (1:2, 500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. After thorough washing, the blots were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a 1:2000 dilution for 45 min at room temperature, washed three times with TBS, and developed with 12 μm p-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 6 μm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in 0.15m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, and 5 mm MgCl2(23Roy S. Purnapatre K. Handa P. Boyanapalli M. Varshney U. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed exactly as described (4Purnapatre K. Handa P. Venkatesh J. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The 5′-biotinylated single-stranded oligomer was immobilized on a SA5 sensor chip, and the various SSBs (EcoSSB, MtuSSB, MtuEcoSSB, andEcoMtuSSB) were passed over the surface to obtain a stable DNA-SSB platform. Thereafter, different concentrations of theEcoUDG and the MtuUDG (400–10,500 nm) were serially passed over the DNA-SSB surface using HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm Na2EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20). The increase in the response units indicated the interaction between the UDGs and the DNA-SSB complex. At the end of each injection of UDG, there was a fall in the response units, which indicated the dissociation of UDGs from the DNA-SSB surface. The sensograms thus obtained were utilized to evaluate the kinetic and equilibrium parameters using the BIAevaluation software. In our earlier studies, we purified SSBs from E. coli BW310, anung − strain (3Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2336-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Purnapatre K. Handa P. Venkatesh J. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we assayed the various SSB preparations from E. coli BW310 (ung −) and E. coli BL21(DE3) (ung +) for the presence of UDG activity. As shown in Fig. 1, EcoSSB andMtuSSB from the ung + E. coli show complete excision of uracil from Loop-U2 (lanes 4 and 6), whereas those from the ung−strain do not exhibit any UDG activity (lanes 3 and5). On the other hand, when a similar assay was carried out with EcoRRF purified from an ung +strain of E. coli BL21 (DE3), no uracil excision was seen (lane 7), indicating that the SSB-UDG interaction is specific. Thus, our first indication of a possible interaction between these two classes of proteins comes from the observation that the SSB preparations from ung + E. colicontained UDG activity despite the fact that the purification schemes for both of the proteins utilize significantly different steps (17Handa P. Roy S. Varshney U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17324-17331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,24Lohman T.M. Green J.M. Beyer R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid approach was used to determine whether the SSBs and the UDGs are capable of interacting in vivo; this was carried out exactly as described earlier (16Handa P. Acharya N. Thanedar S. Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As expected from the homotetrameric nature of the EcoSSB and MtuSSB, the yeast transformants harboring SSBs fused to the activation and the binding domain of GAL4 show growth on medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine and containing 10 mm 3-aminotriazole (Fig.2, sectors 7 and 8, respectively). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae HF7c alone or transformants harboring EcoUDG fused to the activation and the binding domains do not grow under the same conditions (Fig. 2,sectors 1 and 5, respectively). The transformants harboring EcoSSB or MtuSSB in combination withEcoUDG or MtuUDG showed growth (Fig. 2,sectors 2–4 and 6). These data show thatin vivo, SSBs interact with UDGs in homologous (EcoSSB with EcoUDG or MtuSSB withMtuUDG) and heterologous (EcoSSB withMtuUDG or MtuSSB with EcoUDG) combinations. The β-galactosidase assays using S. cerevisiae SFY256 (Table I) reflect the findings of the HIS3 reporter in that the LacZ values obtained for the interaction between SSB and UDG proteins varied from 24 to 40 Miller units (Table I). Although these values are about 20–30% of that of the native GAL4 activator, they are significantly higher than the values obtained for various negative controls (0.8–1.3 Miller units).Table IInteractions of various SSBs with UDGs as indicated by β-galactosidase activityProtein fused to GAL4 DB domainProtein fused to GAL4 AC domainβ-galactosidaseMiller unitsEcoUDGEcoSSB25.65EcoSSBEcoUDG25.98EcoUDGMtuSSB38.7MtuSSBEcoUDG36.33MtuUDGMtuSSB23.97MtuSSBMtuUDG31MtuUDGEcoSSB40.46EcoSSBMtuUDG28.06GAL4120EcoSSB0.855MtuSSB0.8EcoSSBpGAD4241.3Two transformants of each of the combinations were grown in liquid medium till mid log phase (A600 ∼ 1.1) and assayed for LacZ activity (see “Materials and Methods”).

Average values are shown. Variation between the two values for each combination was <10%. Full-length GAL4 activator expressed from pCL1 (LEU2) was used as a positive control. The sequence comparison ofEcoSSB and MtuSSB showed maximum variation in their C-terminal domains downstream of amino acid position 129 (EcoSSB numbering; Refs. 5Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and 16Handa P. Acharya N. Thanedar S. Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal region of EcoSSB has been implicated in its in vivo function, we generated two chimeric constructs between the N- and C-terminal domains of the two SSBs. The DNA sequence at amino acid position 129 (EcoSSB numbering) contains a BamHI site in MtuSSB. As a first step in generating the chimeric constructs, the BamHI site was introduced into theEcoSSB gene by site-directed mutagenesis (G129S mutation), and then the DNA sequences corresponding to the N- and C-terminal domains were swapped between the two SSBs (16Handa P. Acharya N. Thanedar S. Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). The construct MtuEcoSSB contains the N-terminal portion from MtuSSB and the C-terminal domain (48 amino acids) from EcoSSB. Similarly, the chimeric construct EcoMtuSSB comprises the N-terminal domain from EcoSSB and the C-terminal domain (34 amino acids) from MtuSSB. These chimeric SSBs formed homotetramers and bound DNA akin to their native counterparts (16Handa P. Acharya N. Thanedar S. Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The native and the chimeric SSBs and EcoRRF were purified (Fig.4 A) and used in a far Western analysis. The interaction of EcoUDG or MtuUDG with the SSBs was detected by respective polyclonal anti-UDG antibodies (Fig. 4, B–E). Positive controls (EcoUDG andMtuUDG) in lanes 6 (Fig. 4, B andC, respectively) showed that both of the polyclonal antibodies detected UDGs with similar efficiencies. Further, as expected, neither of the antibodies cross-reacted withEcoRRF, which was used as a negative control (Fig. 4,B–E, lanes 5). The membrane probed by anti-EcoUDG antibodies revealed that EcoUDG interacted with both EcoSSB and MtuEcoSSB (Fig.4 B, lanes 2 and 3) but not withMtuSSB and EcoMtuSSB (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1 and 4). Similarly, MtuUDG interacted with MtuSSB and EcoMtuSSB (Fig.4 C, lanes 1 and 4) but not withEcoSSB and MtuEcoSSB (Fig. 4 C,lanes 2 and 3). These observations suggest that the UDGs and SSBs from homologous sources (belonging to the same organism) interact with each other. Because the UDGs also interacted with the chimeric SSBs containing C-terminal domains from SSB of the homologous source, these observations suggest that the interaction between UDG and the SSB is mediated through the C-terminal domain of the latter. When the amounts of SSBs bound to the blots were increased (Fig. 4, D and E), the interactions between the heterologous combinations such as those of EcoUDG withMtuSSB (Fig. 4 D, lane 1) andMtuUDG with EcoSSB and MtuEcoSSB could also be discerned (Fig. 4 E, lanes 2 and3), suggesting that the nature of their interactions is weak. Nevertheless, these interactions appear to be specific, because no interactions of UDGs with EcoRRF were detected (Fig. 4,D and E, lanes 5).Figure 4Far Western blot analyses.

The SSBs and EcoRRF (∼2 μg of each) and UDGs (∼100 ng of each) (B and D) or the SSBs and EcoRRF (∼10 μg of each) (D andE) were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, incubated with EcoUDG (B and D) or MtuUDG (C andE), and detected with the respective anti-UDG antibodies (see “Materials and Methods”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The experiments described thus far showed binary interactions between SSBs and UDGs. To investigate the possibility of ternary interactions involving DNA, SSB, and UDG, electrophoretic mobility shift/supershift assays were carried out. As expected, EcoSSB, MtuSSB,MtuEcoSSB, and EcoMtuSSB formed complexes with DNA (Fig. 5 A, comparelanes 2 and 5 with lanes 1 and4, and Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 2 and4 with lane 1). Further, consistent with the observations of the far Western analysis (Fig. 4 B), whenEcoUDG was added to DNA-EcoSSB or DNA-MtuEcoSSB complexes, a further shift was observed (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and 6). However, under the same conditions, we failed to detect an interaction betweenMtuSSB or EcoMtuSSB and EcoUDG (Fig.5 B, lanes 3 and 5), corroborating our earlier finding of the far Western analysis (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1 and 4). Thus, as was the case with binary interactions, transplantation of the C-terminal 48 amino acids ofEcoSSB into the corresponding region of theMtuSSB was sufficient for a specific ternary interaction. However, when we performed a similar analysis utilizingMtuUDG with the SSBs, a supershift over and above the SSB-DNA complex could not be detected (data not shown). A possible reason for the lack of supershift by MtuUDG could be its high pI (9.5 as opposed to 6.6 of EcoUDG). In fact, when we performed a Western blot analysis of the native gels used for EMSA using polyclonal antibodies to MtuUDG, MtuUDG was found lodged in the wells (data not shown). We have earlier used this methodology to detect interaction among the ternary complexes (DNA, SSBs, and UDGs) (4Purnapatre K. Handa P. Venkatesh J. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We showed that the homologous combinations of SSBs and UDGs (EcoSSB with EcoUDG and MtuSSB withMtuUDG) show stronger affinity, (KD, 1.7 × 10−7 and 1.4 × 10−7m, respectively). Of the heterologous combinations,MtuSSB with EcoUDG showed lower affinity (KD, 8.4 × 10−6m) relative to the homologous combinations of SSBs and UDGs, whereas theEcoSSB with MtuUDG did not show a detectable interaction (4Purnapatre K. Handa P. Venkatesh J. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because the far Western analysis (Fig. 4 E) suggested that there was a weak interaction between EcoSSB and MtuUDG, we reinvestigated our SPR analysis with regard to this heterologous combination of proteins. Upon increasing the concentrations of MtuUDG (up to 10.5 μm), a weak interaction between these proteins could also be discerned (KD, 7.67 × 10−6m; Table II).Table IIKinetic and equilibrium constants of SSBs and UDGs interactionsSSBKinetic parametersEcoUDGMtuUDGEcoSSBka(1/Ms)6.2 × 104 2-aThese numbers were reported earlier (4) and are shown here for comparison.4.6 × 102kd (1/s)1.0 × 10−2 2-aThese numbers were reported earlier (4) and are shown here for comparison.3.53 × 10−3KD(m)1.7 × 10−7 2-aThese numbers were reported earlier (4) and are shown here for comparison.7.67 × 10−6MtuSSBka (1/Ms)1.7 × 102 2-aThese numbers were reported earlier (4) and are shown here for comparison.1.16 × 104 2-aThese numbers were reported earlier (4) and are shown here for comparison.kd (1/s)1.4 × 10−3 2-aThese numbers were reported earlier (4) and are shown here for comparison.1.56 × 10−3 2-aThese numbers were reported earlier (4) and are shown here for comparison.KD (m)8.4 × 10−6 2-aThese numbers were reported earlier (4) and are shown here for comparison.1.4 × 10−7 2-aThese numbers were reported earlier (4) and are shown here for comparison.MtuEcoSSBka(1/Ms)1.84 × 1033.16 × 102kd (1/s)4.5 × 10−31.4 × 10−3KD(m)2.44 × 10−64.46 × 10−6EcoMtuSSBka(1/Ms)ND1.6 × 103kd (1/s)ND3.85 × 10−3KD (m)ND2.4 × 10−6SSBs (∼450–1600 response units) were bound to the biotinylated oligo immobilized onto the SA-5 sensor chip surface, and the UDGs (400–10,500 nm) were used as analytes to determine the parameters of their interaction by BIAcore evaluation software (“Materials and Methods”).

Open table in a new tab SSBs (∼450–1600 response units) were bound to the biotinylated oligo immobilized onto the SA-5 sensor chip surface, and the UDGs (400–10,500 nm) were used as analytes to determine the parameters of their interaction by BIAcore evaluation software (“Materials and Methods”). ND, not detectable. Use of chimeric SSBs in similar experiments shows that theMtuEcoSSB interacted with both the EcoUDG andMtuUDG but that the strength of these interactions (KD, 2.44 × 10−6 and 4.46 × 10−6m, respectively) is substantially lower than those of homologous combinations of SSBs and UDGs. However, a striking outcome of these observations and the far Western analyses (Fig. 4 C) is that although the EcoMtuSSB interacts with MtuUDG (KD, 2.4 × 10−6m), it is incapable of interacting withEcoUDG. Therefore, the interaction of EcoUDG withEcoSSB and MtuEcoSSB but not withEcoMtuSSB suggests that the EcoSSB contactsEcoUDG through its C-terminal domain. Taken together, these findings show that the C-terminal domains of both EcoSSB andMtuSSB are primarily responsible for their interactions with the respective UDGs, and at least in the case of EcoSSB, the data allow us to conclude that its C-terminal domain is necessary and sufficient to engage EcoUDG as one of its interacting partners. On the other hand, the existence of weak interactions betweenMtuUDG and MtuEcoSSB or EcoSSB (Fig.4 E and Table II) does not permit us to completely rule out the contribution of the N-terminal domains of the SSBs (possibly through the conserved amino acids) for the interactions involving the mycobacterial proteins. We earlier showed that EcoSSB enhanced excision of uracil from Loop-U2 by EcoUDG and MtuUDG. On the contrary, although the inclusion of MtuSSB in the reactions containing the same substrate with MtuUDG stimulated uracil excision, it resulted in decreased activity of EcoUDG, most likely as a consequence of inappropriate interaction (4Purnapatre K. Handa P. Venkatesh J. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Far Western analysis and the SPR studies showed a discernible interaction between the chimeric SSBs and UDGs (for most of the combinations). Therefore, it was of interest to investigate the effect of the chimeric SSBs on uracil excision activity of the UDGs using Loop-U2 as a substrate. Neither MtuEcoSSB nor EcoMtuSSB alone showed any uracil excision activity (Fig.6 A, lanes 1 and2). However, when included in the reactions along withEcoUDG, MtuEcoSSB stimulated the uracil excision activity (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 4 and5 with lanes 7 and 8), andEcoMtuSSB showed a decrease in uracil excision activity ofEcoUDG (compare lanes 4 and 5 withlanes 10 and 11). Furthermore, as observed before with the native SSBs, the chimeric SSBs led to a stimulation of uracil excision by MtuUDG (Fig. 6 B, compare lane 3 with lanes 6 and 9). Thus, these results suggest that the C-terminal domains within the chimeric SSBs are sufficient to mimic the typical effects of their native counterparts on the uracil excision activity of the two UDGs from Loop-U2. However, not surprisingly, the effects of chimeric SSBs, which contain the C-terminal domains in the context of heterologous N-terminal domains, on uracil excision are not as pronounced as seen before with the native SSBs (3Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2336-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Analysis of the DNA binding activity of the chimeric SSBs revealed that they both bound Loop-U2 with similar efficiency (Fig. 7), suggesting that, as seen earlier with the mutants of EcoSSB deleted for the C-terminal domain (11Curth U. Genschel J. Urbanke C. Greipel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2706-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the DNA binding properties of SSBs can be mediated by the N-terminal domains, independent of the C-terminal domains. However, for the functional participation of the C-terminal domain with various cellular proteins, the context of the N-terminal domain is also important. Occurrence of such “cross-talk” between the N- and C-terminal domains of SSB could explain why in our earlier studies, the MtuEcoSSB chimera, despite containing the C-terminal domain from EcoSSB, failed to complement a Δssb strain of E. coli (16Handa P. Acharya N. Thanedar S. Purnapatre K. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). SSBs play a vital role in a variety of DNA metabolic processes including replication, recombination, and repair (6Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence for the association of SSBs with several proteins such as the χ subunit of the DNA polymerase, primase, RecA, and the proteins involved in DNA repair such as UvrD, exonuclease I, MucB, and MucA (25Kelman Z. Yuzhakov A. Andjelkovic J. O' Donell M. EMBO J. 1998; 8: 2436-2449Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 26Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M.

By using the chimeric constructs in studies employing the far Western analysis, SPR, and EMSA, we show that the C-terminal domain of SSB is responsible for interacting with UDG. TheEcoSSB or a chimera containing its C-terminal domain interacts with EcoUDG in a binary (SSB-UDG) or a ternary (DNA-SSB-UDG) complex. However, neither MtuSSB nor the chimera containing the N-terminal domain from EcoSSB shows such interactions. Thus, the C-terminal domain (48 amino acids) ofEcoSSB is necessary and sufficient for interaction withEcoUDG. Similarly, the C-terminal domain ofMtuSSB mediated the interaction with MtuUDG. However, weak interactions of MtuUDG with EcoSSB and the chimeric SSB lacking the C-terminal domain of MtuSSB (MtuEcoSSB) suggested that the conserved amino acids in the N-terminal domains of SSBs might also contribute to their association. Further, from the activity assays shown in Fig. 6, it appears that the effect of SSBs on uracil excision from the structured oligomer, Loop-U2, is mediated through the C-terminal domain. The crystal structure of EcoSSB shows the C termini as flexible arms extending out of the globular central structure (9Matsumoto T. Morimoto Y. Shibata N. Kinebuchi T. Shimamoto N. Tsukihara T. Yasuoka N. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 127: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This extensible structure of the C terminus supports the view that it is able to mediate interactions with proteins in vivo. Recent studies with the human UDG have shown that it interacts with the 34-kDa subunit and the trimeric form of the human homolog of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, replication protein A (13Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Singh K.K. Keshav K.F. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Bharati S. Lindmo T. Benichou S. Benarous R. Krokan H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6561-6566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Subsequently it was demonstrated that UDG also interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, suggesting that these proteins exist as a part of a multiprotein complex that carries out the long patch base excision repair involving proliferating cell nuclear antigen, polymerase δ, FEN1, and DNA ligase I at the replication foci (14Otterlei M. Warbrick E. Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Slupphaug G. Akbari M. Aas P.A. Steinsbekk K. Bakke O. Krokan H.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3834-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The increasing evidence for the involvement of replication protein A in excision repair sets a precedent for a similar scenario in the prokaryotic systems and hints at the universality of the phenomenon. Thus, it appears that the SSB-UDG interaction would be important in uracil excision repair in the regions of the genome that become transiently single-stranded, such as the transcription bubble or replication fork. It is not surprising, therefore, that in humans, expression of UDG is cell cycle-regulated (31Slupphaug G. Olsen L.C. Helland D. Aasland R. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5131-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). From a physiological perspective, it would be preferable to have noninstructional lesions (AP sites) than the miscoding bases in the DNA during replication, because such lesions allow for postreplicative repair to occur. A DNA glycosylase could potentially alter a miscoding base into an AP site if it was associated with the protein complexes at the replication fork (32Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjoras M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Further, detection and removal of uracil from the newly synthesized DNA at the replication fork will also be ideal in avoiding the consequences of its misincorporation by the DNA polymerases. The single-stranded regions in DNA are inherently prone to cytosine deamination. Because there is a greater potential of extrusion of DNA into complex structures in the single-stranded regions that may arise in the DNA as a consequence of various physiological processes, our studies on the uracil release from the hairpin DNA (3Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2336-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Ghosh M. Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Chary K.V.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3938-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Ghosh M. Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Chary K.V.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and the effect of SSB on UDG activity on such substrates provide a good model system to examine the uracil excision repair pathway. We have earlier shown that one aspect of SSB-mediated stimulation of base excision repair is destabilization of the structured substrates (3Kumar N.V. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2336-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Purnapatre K. Handa P. Venkatesh J. Varshney U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The SSB-UDG interactions that we demonstrate here could also be crucial from the physiological perspective. The observation that UDG can interact with the SSB in a binary (SSB-UDG) or a ternary (DNA-SSB-UDG) complex suggests that SSB may facilitate recruitment of UDG to the site of the lesion by serving as a carrier. Alternatively, by virtue of the ternary interactions, the DNA-bound SSB may enhance the binding of the UDG to the site of the lesion. Further, the mechanism of how SSB switches its interacting partners including UDG, most of which localize to the C-terminal domain, remains to be clarified.

The pre-eminent neuropathological feature of TSEs is the accumulation of the disease-specific, protease-resistant isoform of prion protein, designated as PrP-res or PrPSc, in the central nervous system. PrP-res is generated post-translationally from the normal, protease-sensitive isoform of prion protein, PrP-sen or PrPC. Although several lines of evidence suggest that PrP-res is a major component of the infectious TSE agent, the full identity of the agent is still unclear.Studies using transgenic mice, PrP-deficient mice, and neuronal tissue grafts revealed that an interaction between PrP-sen and PrP-res that leads to PrP-res accumulation plays a central role in the propagation of infectivity and neurodegeneration (1Scott M.

Although previous efforts have described several aspects of the interaction between the two PrP isoforms, the molecular details of the interaction and conversion mechanism remain to be elucidated.Direct interactions of synthetic PrP peptides with PrP molecules indicated the possible usefulness of PrP synthetic peptides for studying the mechanism of PrP-sen-PrP-res interaction. For instance, Ha109–141 and Ha119–136 can inhibit PrP-res formation in cell-free PrP-res-induced conversion reactions and in scrapie-infected cell cultures (12Chabry J. Caughey B. Chesebro B. J.

In this study, we have investigated this possibility further by testing the effects of various synthetic peptides corresponding to portions of the C-terminal half of the PrP amino acid sequence. Ha166–179 and Ha200–223 strongly inhibited the protease-resistant PrP formation in cell-free conversion assays, while Ha180–199 showed much weaker inhibition. In addition, we have addressed mechanistic aspects of the inhibition by various peptides, including Ha109–141, and found that the peptides inhibit by binding to PrP-sen and blocking its binding to PrP-res.DISCUSSIONSince TSE pathogenesis and PrP-res formation involve precise interactions between PrP isoforms, we have studied the effects of synthetic PrP peptides to gain insight into these interactions. Previous studies revealed that Ha109–141 and shorter subfragments such as Ha117–141 inhibited the transformation of PrP-sen to protease-resistant forms in vitro (12Chabry J. Caughey B. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13203-13207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Chabry J. Priola S.A. Wehrly K. Nishio J. Hope J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6245-6250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we identify peptides from three other segments within the C-terminal third of the PrP sequence that inhibit protease-resistant PrP formation. Ha166–179 and Ha200–223 have potencies (IC50values) that are comparable to that of Ha109–141 and Ha117–141, while Ha180–199 was much less potent. There was strong amino acid sequence dependence to the inhibition by Ha166–179, but this dependence was less pronounced for Ha200–223.It is unclear why two different randomized permutations of Ha200–223 inhibited the PrP-res formation to some extent. However, it is possible that a certain oligopeptide or structural motif was maintained in the randomized sequences that allowed binding to PrP-sen or PrP-res and inhibition of conversion. Although we could not discern any obviously conserved pattern of residues on cursory examination, identification of such a motif may contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of PrP-res formation and possible therapeutics for TSEs.The PrP-res-induced transformation of PrP-sen into protease-resistant forms can be separated kinetically and biochemically into two different steps; first, the binding between PrP-sen and PrP-res, and second, the conversion of the bound PrP-sen to PrP-res (7DebBurman S.K. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13938-13943Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar,8Horiuchi M. Chabry J. Caughey B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 11Horiuchi M. Priola S.A. Chabry J. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5836-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, the generation of protease-resistant PrP can be impaired either at the binding or conversion steps. Our data indicate that the inhibition of protease-resistant PrP formation by the PrP peptides Ha109–141, Ha166–179, and Ha200–223 was due to interference with the initial binding between the two PrP isoforms. Since Ha117–141 and Ha166–179 were able to bind PrP-sen, but were not inhibitory when preincubated with PrP-res, it is likely that their inhibition of conversion is due to binding to PrP-sen in a way that hinders the PrP-sen-PrP-res interaction. Interestingly, Ha180–199 was more efficient than Ha200–223 at binding of PrP-sen in the solid phase assay, but was 5–10-fold less potent as an inhibitor of conversion. Hence, although we conclude that inhibition of PrP conversion by Ha109–141, Ha166–179, and Ha200–223 is likely to be due to peptide binding to PrP-sen, the binding of peptides to PrP-sen is not always sufficient to block conversion. Further analyses will be required to clarify whether or not direct binding of the peptides to PrP-res occurs.In the cases of Ha109–141, Ha117–141, and Ha166–179, where binding to PrP-sen appears to be important for inhibition, at least a couple of different mechanisms can be envisioned to account for these effects. First, the peptides, or polymers thereof, might bind to PrP-sen and physically block the PrP-res-binding site. Alternatively, the binding of the peptides might overstabilize PrP-sen or cause a change to a conformation that is incapable of binding PrP-res.For mechanistic reasons, it is important to consider the stoichiometry of the inhibitory peptides relative to PrP-sen and PrP-res in the conversion reactions. The cell-free conversion reactions contained ∼2 nm PrP-sen(GPINEG) and ∼150 nmPrP-res. Thus, the peptides with IC50 values of ≥10 μm required at least 60-fold stoichiometric excesses of peptide over PrP molecules to exert their inhibitory effects. One possible explanation for the need for stoichiometric excesses for inhibition by these peptides is that formation of high β-sheet aggregates or polymers of the PrP peptides may be required to compete with PrP-res for binding to PrP-sen. This would be consistent with the observations that peptides Ha109–141, Ha117–141, and Ha200–223 can form β-sheet-rich structures according to Fourier transform infrared and/or CD analyses (see Ref. 12Chabry J. Caughey B. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13203-13207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar and this study). The secondary structure of Ha166–179 could not be assessed with CD because of the presence of the highly far UV-absorbent solvent dimethyl sulfoxide, which was required for initial dissolution of this peptide. However, a similar synthetic peptide of human PrP residues 169–185 was reported to form an aggregate of rod-like structure and exhibit Congo red birefringence (27Goldfarb L.G. Brown P. Haltia M. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Gajdusek D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4451-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ha166–179 may form a β-sheet-rich structure. It is also possible that monomers of the PrP peptides can bind to PrP-sen and inhibit conversion, but that stoichiometric excess of inhibitory peptides is required because of the relative affinities of the peptides and PrP-sen for PrP-res. Although it remains to be elucidated which form of these inhibitory peptides binds to PrP-sen, the binding itself suggests the peptides may serve as useful probes of the sites of the PrP-sen-PrP-res interaction such as the regions on the PrP-res molecule(s) which are involved in the interaction.The direct binding of PrP-sen to Ha109–141, Ha166–179, and (apparently) Ha200–223, but not numerous other PrP-derived peptides, suggests that the PrP-sen-binding domain on PrP-res may include residues contained in these inhibitory peptides. The lack of observed binding between PrP-sen and Ha200–223 in the solid phase analysis may be due to a lack of Ha200–223 fibril formation or some other artifactual interference with PrP-sen binding on the solid phase support. It is noteworthy that Ha200–223, unlike the other peptides, has internal lysine and cysteine residues that could react to the derivatized wells. This might restrict interactions with PrP-sen more than binding solely via N- or C-terminal residues which is the mode of attachment for the other peptides. Interestingly, a previous analysis has suggested that a specific antibody that inhibits the binding and conversion reactions would likely sterically hinder access to residues on PrP-sen that are contained in the peptides Ha109–141, Ha166–179, and Ha200–223 (8Horiuchi M. Chabry J. Caughey B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, the available data suggest that residues contained in one or more of these three inhibitory peptides may be important in the binding sites on both PrP-sen and PrP-res. Dimerization of PrP molecules is proposed to generate a PrP-res specific epitope (28Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that a conformational domain comprising several regions of one PrP-res molecule or several regions of different PrP-res molecules is involved in binding to PrP-sen and inducing its conformational transformation. It is conceivable that these regions on the PrP-res molecule correspond to the inhibitory peptides identified in this and previous studies.The binding of PrP-sen to the individual PrP peptide inhibitors was not adequate to form protease-resistant PrP even at the highest concentration tested (Fig. 2), consistent with the idea that multiple regions on PrP-res are involved in causing the conformational transformation of PrP-sen. As noted above, a previous study showed that vast stoichiometric excesses of Ha90–145 could cause PrP-sen to gain some PK-resistance, however, this was not the characteristic partial PK-resistance of TSE-associated PrP-res (14Kaneko K. Peretz D. Pan K. Blockberger T.C. Wille H. Gabizon R. Griffith O.H. Cohen F.E. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 11160-11164Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not yet apparent that any synthetic peptide can induce the conversion of PrP-sen to bona fide PrP-res. The conformation of the peptide inhibitors may have similarity but not identity to the corresponding PrP-sen-binding domain on PrP-res polymers. Thus incomplete reconstitution of the PrP-sen-binding domain by individual peptides may also account for lower selectivity than PrP-res in the binding of PrP-sen versus other proteins (Fig. 8). Perhaps a combination of different PrP synthetic peptides in a given spatial distribution will be required to more closely mimic PrP-sen-PrP-res interactions. However, initial attempts at combining Ha166–179 and Ha200–223 at 2.5 and 5 μm, respectively (i.e.slightly below their IC50 values), did not indicate either additive or synergistic effects of these two peptide inhibitors (data not shown).Our data suggest that the region including residues 166–179, which forms an extended loop structure between the second β-strand and second α-helix (29Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) plays an important role in PrP-res formation. By contrast, a PrP mutant lacking residues 23–88 and 141–176 (PrP106) was able to form protease-resistant PrP (30Muramoto T. Scott M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Scott M. Cell. 1999; 96: 869-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, an amber mutation of human PrP at residue 145 caused Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome with PrP plaques consisting of mutant PrP (32Kitamoto T. Iizuka R. Tateishi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the region corresponding to Ha166–179 may not be essential for PrP-res formation. However, this is apparently not generally true for PrP-res formation in TSE diseases of infectious origin. For instance, it is well known that sheep homozygous for Arg/Arg at residues 171 of PrP are resistant to scrapie (reviewed in Ref. 33Bossers A. Schreuder B.E. Muileman I.H. Belt P.B. Smits M.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition, substitutions of PrP residues 167 and 171 prevented PrP-res formation in scrapie-infected cell cultures (21Kaneko K. Vey M. Scott M. Pilkuhn S. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that there are multiple types of PrP-res formed and that the region corresponding to residues 166–179 is involved in the formation of PrP-res from full-length PrP-sen precursors.Compounds that can facilitate the clearance of accumulated PrP-res (34Soto C.

In addition, compounds indirectly affecting PrP-res formation may also have therapeutic value. The combined usage of compounds with different mechanisms for inhibiting of PrP-res accumulation may have synergistic effects in TSE therapeutics. The list of compounds which inhibit PrP-res formation and/or prolong the incubation periods of scrapie in rodents is growing (35Caughey W.S. Raymond L.D. Horiuchi M. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The experimental procedures used in this study may contribute to the analysis of such mechanisms. In addition, the assays of the direct interaction between PrP-sen and PrP-res and/or PrP synthetic peptides in multiwell plates may provide high throughput screens for compounds that inhibit those interactions. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)1 are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that include scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, chronic wasting disease in deer and elk, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The pre-eminent neuropathological feature of TSEs is the accumulation of the disease-specific, protease-resistant isoform of prion protein, designated as PrP-res or PrPSc, in the central nervous system. PrP-res is generated post-translationally from the normal, protease-sensitive isoform of prion protein, PrP-sen or PrPC. Although several lines of evidence suggest that PrP-res is a major component of the infectious TSE agent, the full identity of the agent is still unclear. Studies using transgenic mice, PrP-deficient mice, and neuronal tissue grafts revealed that an interaction between PrP-sen and PrP-res that leads to PrP-res accumulation plays a central role in the propagation of infectivity and neurodegeneration (1Scott M.

Furthermore, the formation of PrP-res and propagation of TSE infectivity in animals and cultured cells require PrP amino acid sequence compatibility between the recipient and donor of infectivity (4Prusiner S.B.

Cell-free experiments have shown that PrP-res can selectively bind PrP-sen (7DebBurman S.K. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Further studies of this two-step process revealed that the direct binding of PrP-sen to PrP-res is less dependent upon PrP amino acid compatibility than the conformational transformation to the protease-resistant state (10Kocisko D.A.

Although previous efforts have described several aspects of the interaction between the two PrP isoforms, the molecular details of the interaction and conversion mechanism remain to be elucidated. Direct interactions of synthetic PrP peptides with PrP molecules indicated the possible usefulness of PrP synthetic peptides for studying the mechanism of PrP-sen-PrP-res interaction. For instance, Ha109–141 and Ha119–136 can inhibit PrP-res formation in cell-free PrP-res-induced conversion reactions and in scrapie-infected cell cultures (12Chabry J. Caughey B. Chesebro B. J.

Differences in the function and metabolism of LpA-I and LpA-I/A-II have been reported, and studies in transgenic mice have suggested that apoA-II is pro-atherogenic in contrast to anti-atherogenic apoA-I. The molecular basis for these observations is unclear. The scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) is an HDL receptor that plays a key role in HDL metabolism. In this study we investigated the abilities of apoA-I and apoA-II to mediate SR-BI-specific binding and selective uptake of cholesterol ester using reconstituted HDLs (rHDLs) that were homogeneous in size and apolipoprotein content. Particles were labeled in the protein (with125I) and in the lipid (with [3H]cholesterol ether) components and SR-BI-specific events were analyzed in SR-BI-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. At 1 μg/ml apolipoprotein, SR-BI-mediated cell association of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine-containing AI-rHDL was significantly greater (3-fold) than that of AI/AII-rHDL, with a lowerKd and a higher Bmax for AI-rHDL as compared with AI/AII-rHDL. Unexpectedly, selective cholesterol ester uptake from AI/AII-rHDL was not compromised compared with AI-rHDL, despite decreased binding. The efficiency of selective cholesterol ester uptake in terms of SR-BI-associated rHDL was 4–5-fold greater for AI/AII-rHDL than AI-rHDL. These results are consistent with a two-step mechanism in which SR-BI binds ligand and then mediates selective cholesterol ester uptake with an efficiency dependent on the composition of the ligand. ApoA-II decreases binding but increases selective uptake. These findings show that apoA-II can exert a significant influence on selective cholesterol ester uptake by SR-BI and may consequently influence the metabolism and function of HDL, as well as the pathway of reverse cholesterol transport.

Unexpectedly, selective cholesterol ester uptake from AI/AII-rHDL was not compromised compared with AI-rHDL, despite decreased binding. The efficiency of selective cholesterol ester uptake in terms of SR-BI-associated rHDL was 4–5-fold greater for AI/AII-rHDL than AI-rHDL. These results are consistent with a two-step mechanism in which SR-BI binds ligand and then mediates selective cholesterol ester uptake with an efficiency dependent on the composition of the ligand. ApoA-II decreases binding but increases selective uptake. These findings show that apoA-II can exert a significant influence on selective cholesterol ester uptake by SR-BI and may consequently influence the metabolism and function of HDL, as well as the pathway of reverse cholesterol transport. high density lipoprotein scavenger receptor class B, type I Chinese hamster ovary bovine serum albumin reconstituted HDL dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline l-α-palmitoyloleolyl-phosphatidylcholine cholesterol ester HDL1 levels are inversely related to the risk of atherosclerotic disease (1Gordon D.J. Rifkind B.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar, 2Tall A.R. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19 Suppl. A: A31-A35PubMed Google Scholar). One protective function of HDL is its role in reverse cholesterol transport, a pathway by which unesterified cholesterol from peripheral cells is taken up by HDL, esterified by the enzyme lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase on HDL, and then transported as cholesteryl ester (CE) to liver and steroidogenic cells by a process of selective lipid uptake in which cholesteryl esters of HDL are taken up without concomitant apolipoprotein uptake (3Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pieters M.N. Schouten D. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1225: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). HDL is a mixture of different types of particles that vary in size, density, and composition (5Cheung M.C. Albers J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11201-11209Google Scholar) and consists of particles containing both apoA-I and apoA-II (LpA-I/A-II) and those containing apoA-I but not apoA-II (LpA-I). ApoA-II is the second most abundant protein in HDL, but its physiological function is unclear. Studies have indicated that the levels of HDL cholesterol and apoA-I are affected by the rate of synthesis of apoA-II in both humans and mice (6Bu X. Warden C.H. Xia Y.R. De Meester C. Puppione D.L.

ApoA-II-deficient mice have markedly reduced HDL levels and increased HDL cholesterol and apoA-I fractional catabolic rates (8Weng W. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14788-14794Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, some studies suggest that apoA-II functions in a “pro-atherogenic manner,” in contrast to “anti-atherogenic” apoA-I. Transgenic mice overexpressing either human (9Schultz J.R. Verstuyft J.G. Gong E.L. Nichols A.V. Rubin E.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) or mouse (10Warden C.H. Hedrick C.C. Qiao J.H. Castellani L.W. Lusis A.J. Science. 1993; 261: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) apoA-II were found to be more susceptible to atherosclerosis. In contrast, however, a recent report showed decreased susceptibility to diet-induced atherosclerosis in human apoA-II transgenic mice (11Tailleux A. Bouly M. Luc G. Castro G. Caillaud J.M.

Certain evidence has demonstrated differences in the metabolism and function of LpA-I and LpA-I/A-II. Turnover studies in humans revealed that apoA-I in LpA-I is more rapidly catabolized than apoA-I in LpA-I/A-II (12Rader D.J. Castro G. Zech L.A. Fruchart J.C. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1849-1859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in rats cholesteryl esters were more efficiently secreted into the bile from LpA-I than LpA-I/A-II (13Pieters N. Castro G. Schouten D. Duchateau P. Fruchart J.-C. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Studies in vitro have reported that LpA-I is more efficient in the delivery of cholesteryl ester to cells (14Rinninger F. Kaiser T. Windler E. Greten H. Fruchart J.-C. Castro G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and, in some (15Barbaras R. Puchois P. Fruchart J.C. Ailhaud G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, the molecular basis for these observations is not understood. ApoA-II has been reported to negatively affect a number of processes involved in HDL metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport, including the activities of hepatic lipase (20Zhong S. Goldberg I.J. Bruce C. Rubin E. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2457-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), cholesterylester transfer protein (21Lagrost L. Persegol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (22Francone O.L. Gong E.L. Ng D.S. Fielding C.J. Rubin E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and may therefore exert some effects through the modulation of HDL lipid composition and/or apoA-I conformation. The scavenger receptor, SR-BI, plays a major role in HDL metabolism, binding HDL and mediating selective lipid uptake from HDL into the liver and steroidogenic cells (23Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Kreiger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 24Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M.

Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera-Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

The receptor exhibits a broad ligand specificity and binds native LDL, oxidized LDL, and VLDL in addition to HDL (23Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Kreiger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 29Calvo D. Gomez-Coronado D. Suarez Y. Lasuncion M.A. Vega M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 777-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anionic phospholipids also reportedly bind to SR-BI, as do the apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, and C-III, either as lipid-bound molecules or as free apolipoproteins (30Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the finding that the binding of rHDL by SR-BI is significantly greater for particles containing only apoA-I (AI-rHDL) compared with particles containing both apoA-I and apoA-II (AI/AII-rHDL). The ability of apoAI/AII-rHDL to deliver cholesterol ester via selective lipid uptake is, however, not compromised and is actually increased. ApoA-II modulation of SR-BI activity, therefore, may contribute to the reported differences in function and metabolism between LpA-I and LpA-I/A-II. Human apoA-I and apoA-II were prepared from blood plasma purchased from the Champaign County Blood Bank, Regional Health Resource Center, as described previously (31Blanche P.J. Nichols A.V. Forte T.M. Gong E.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 958: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 32Durbin D.M. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31333-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Human HDL3 (d = 1.13–1.18 g/ml) was isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation as previously described (33Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). l-α-Palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), l-α-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), crystalline cholesterol, sodium cholate, and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma. Radiolabeled DPPC 2-palmitoyl-9,10-3[H] came from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; and [1α, 2α(n)3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether and sodium [125I]iodide were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Reconstituted HDL containing POPC and DPPC were prepared by the sodium cholate dialysis method as described (34Matz C. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Briefly, rHDL containing human apoA-I were prepared using molar ratios of 1/5/95, apoA-I/free cholesterol/palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) or 1/5/100, apoA-I/free cholesterol/dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The dimeric apo-A-II (Mr 17,400) particles contained the same mass of phospholipid and free cholesterol per mg of apoA-II protein as rHDL prepared with apoA-I. rHDL-containing cholesteryl esters were prepared by using molar ratios of 1/5/3/95 of apoA-I/free cholesterol/cholesteryl oleate/phospholipid. The purity and size of rHDL were examined on 8–25% gradient gels under non-denaturing conditions using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Phast System. The rHDL particles were ∼100 Å in diameter and particles were >95% homogeneous in size. Chemical cross-linking with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate determined that AI-rHDL contained two molecules of apoA-I, and AII-rHDL contained four molecules of dimeric apoA-II with less than 5% lipid-free apoprotein. Protein concentrations of lipid-free or lipid-bound apoA-I and apoA-II were determined as the average of concentrations measured by the Lowry assay (36Markwell M. Haas S. Bieber L. Tolbert N. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar) and absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 1.13 ml/mg·cm for apoA-I, or at 276 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 0.69 ml/mg·cm for apoA-II (37Pownall H. Massey J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed within 20 days of particle preparation to avoid time-dependent size rearrangement of particles. Hybrid AI/AII rHDL was prepared by incubating lipid-free apo-AII with AI-rHDL at a molar ratio of 2:1 AI/AII for at least 20 min at room temperature. This resulted in one dimeric apoA-II molecule on each rHDL. These particles were used within 24 h. For cell association studies, the different rHDL preparations were added on the basis of equivalent particle numbers (expressed as apoA-I equivalents). Human HDL and rHDL preparations were labeled in the protein moiety with sodium [125I]iodide using the iodine monochloride method (38Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the HDL ranged from 400 to 600 cpm/ng protein. The phospholipid component of the rHDL was also labeled with3H by adding [3H]DPPC (2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H)(40–50 cpm/ng apoA-I) to the bulk lipids prior to preparation of the complexes. For studies involving the selective uptake of cholesterol ester, the desired amount of CE as well as [1α,2α(n)3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (40–50 cpm/ng apoA-I) were added to the lipids prior to preparation of the complexes. The apolipoprotein component of these particles was labeled with sodium [125I]iodide to a specific activity of less than 100 cpm/ng protein. Human SR-BI cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression vector pCMV5 (39Andersson S. Davis D.N. Dählback H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells (clone ldlA7) stably transfected with human SR-BI (CHO-SRBI) were produced and maintained as described previously (33Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to CHO-SRBI cells was carried out in 12-well plates essentially as described by Acton et al. (23Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Kreiger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 40Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Kreiger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell association at 37 °C was performed in Ham'-s F12 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA, and HDL labeled with 125I- or [3H]DPPC. Selective uptake studies were performed with HDL double-labeled with 125I- and [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether. For binding at 4 °C, cells were preincubated in the above medium at 37 °C for 1 h, washed twice with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA, and then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with the indicated ligand in Ham's F-12 buffered with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and containing 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA. After incubation for the required time, cells were washed four times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA, followed by two washes with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and then dissolved in 0.1 nNaOH for radioactivity measurement and protein determination. Non-iodide trichloroacetic acid-soluble degradation products were measured in the culture medium, and in all cases were <15% of the cell-associated material. SR-BI-specific values were calculated as the difference between the values obtained in CHO-SRBI cells and untransfected control CHO cells. Values in untransfected cells were in all cases less than 20% of the values in CHO-SRBI cells. The selective uptake of ligand was determined by subtracting the amount of bound ligand (calculated from the 125I cell-associated radioactivity) from the total amount of cell-associated ligand (calculated from the cell-associated 3H label). ApparentKd and Bmax values for binding were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the SR-BI-specific cell-associated values using Prism software. To investigate the influence of apoA-II on the binding of HDL to SR-BI, rHDL particles containing defined apolipoprotein compositions were prepared. Each of these particles, in the form of discs, were >95% homogeneous in size (∼100 Å in diameter) and contained either two molecules of apoA-I (AI-rHDL), four molecules of apoA-II (AII-rHDL), or two molecules of apoA-I plus one molecule of dimeric apoA-II (AI/AII-rHDL). Each preparation contained less than 5% lipid-free apolipoprotein. To assess rHDL binding to SR-BI, DPPC-containing particles were first iodinated with125I and then incubated with CHO cells transfected with human SR-BI (CHO-SRBI). Cell association at 37 °C of rHDL to CHO-SRBI cells reached a maximum within 30 min (data not shown). Marked differences in the association of the three types of particles were observed (Fig. 1). In these experiments, ligands were added on the basis of equivalent particle numbers (expressed as A-I equivalents). Cell association is expressed in terms of apoA-I binding and, in the case of AI/AII- and AII-rHDL, in terms of apoA-I equivalents. This was calculated from the known apolipoprotein content of each of the rHDL preparations. SR-BI-specific values are shown and represent the difference between the values obtained in CHO-SRBI cells and untransfected control CHO cells. SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of CE from HDL without uptake and subsequent degradation of HDL apolipoproteins (23Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Kreiger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). In line with this, relatively low degradation of HDL protein was observed in all experiments (degradation <15% of cell-associated protein). For this reason, cell-associated values were taken to represent cell surface binding. The binding of AI-rHDL was found to be significantly higher than that of the apoA-II-containing particles at all concentrations tested. At a ligand concentration of 10 μg/ml, binding of AI-rHDL was ∼3- and 12-fold greater than the binding of AI/AII-rHDL and AII-rHDL, respectively. The affinity of binding of AI-rHDL was greater than that of AI/AII-rHDL or AII-rHDL (apparent Kd = 3.2 ± 0.9 μg/ml, 5.6 ± 0.8 μg/ml and 12.5 ± 5.1 μg/ml, respectively). The maximum binding values for the three ligands also varied (Bmax = 2.3 ± 0.2, 0.96 ± 0.05 and 0.33 ± 0.07 μg/mg cell protein) for AI-rHDL, AI/AII-rHDL, and AII-rHDL, respectively). The affinity of binding of these particles was relatively high compared with that of HDL that has been reported to bind SR-BI with a Kd value between 15 and 30 μg/ml (23Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Kreiger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 33Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A.

As an alternative type of ligand, rHDL were prepared using POPC in place of DPPC. These phospholipids exhibit a lower phase transition more typical of naturally occurring phospholipids in HDL. POPC-containing rHDL particles were prepared by the sodium cholate dialysis method and fractionated by gel filtration chromatography to a homogeneous 96-Å-sized population before use. Fig.2 shows the cell association of POPC-containing particles labeled with the phospholipid [3H]DPPC as an alternative approach to 125I labeling. SR-BI-specific association of AI-rHDL was greater than that of the two other ligands. The affinity of binding of POPC-containing AI-rHDL was greater than the affinities of POPC-containing AI/AII-rHDL and AII-rHDL (apparent Kd = 1.2 ± 0.1, 2.6 ± 0.6, and 2.8 ± 0.3 μg/ml, respectively).Bmax values for AI-rHDL, AI/AII-rHDL, and AII-rHDL were 0.83 ± 0.02, 0.56 ± 0.04, and 0.78 ± 0.02 μg/ml, respectively. At a ligand concentration of 1 μg/ml, AI-rHDL binding was 1.8- and 3-fold greater than the binding of AII-rHDL and AI/AII-rHDL, respectively. It is possible that the values obtained in this experiment (Fig. 2) may in part represent cellular uptake of the phospholipid label, in addition to cell-surface binding, since SR-BI has been reported to exhibit phospholipid uptake activity (42Urban S. Zieseniss S. Werder M. Hauser H. Budzinski R. Engelmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33409-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The three POPC-containing rHDLs were also studied using particles labeled by 125I iodination. Relative binding of the three 125I-labeled rHDLs at 37 °C was similar to that obtained using [3H]DPPC as the label (Fig.3). In the case of AI-rHDL and AI/AII-rHDL, binding levels were similar at 4 and 37 °C (Fig. 3), consistent with the conclusion that 125I-ligand association reflected binding of particles at the cell surface. The results (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) indicate that apoA-II serves as a high -affinity ligand for SR-BI but binds somewhat less effectively than apoA-I. This finding is in agreement with previous reports by Xu et al. (30Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Pilonet al. (43Pilon A. Briand O. Lestavel S. Copin C. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Castro G. Clavey V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, in those studies the rHDL preparations were heterogeneous in size, and their apolipoprotein content, in terms of number of apolipoprotein molecules per particle, was not defined. The level of binding at 37 °C of 125I-labeled AII-rHDL, relative to the other rHDLs, was greater in POPC-containing particles than in DPPC-containing particles (Fig. 1). Incubation at 4 °C (Fig. 3) resulted in relative levels of binding of the three ligands that were similar to those observed with DPPC-containing particles (Fig. 1), with AII-rHDL exhibiting the lowest binding of the three rHDL types. These results indicate that the relative abilities of the rHDLs to bind SR-BI can be modulated by the phospholipid composition of the particle and temperature. For particles containing both apoA-I and apoA-II, the presence of apoA-II consistently exerted an inhibitory effect on SR-BI association.Figure 3Comparative binding of POPC-containing rHDL to SR-BI at 37 and 4 °C. CHO-SRBI cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C or for 2 h at 4 °C with POPC-containing 125I-labeled rHDL. Equivalent moles of each rHDL were added (5 μg/ml apoA-I equivalents). Cell-associated label was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SR-BI-specific cell association is shown that was calculated as the difference between values for CHO-SRBI cells and non-transfected CHO cells. Values are the means (±S.D.) of triplicate determinations. Similar results were obtained in an additional experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SR-BI binding of the different rHDL preparations was also assessed by competitive ligand binding using 125I-HDL3 as the labeled ligand and POPC-containing rHDL preparations as competitors (Fig. 4). AI-rHDL was the most effective competitor against HDL3 binding, whereas AII-rHDL and AI/AII-rHDL competed significantly less effectively for SR-BI binding. Unlabeled HDL3 inhibited binding the least effectively, in line with its lower affinity for SR-BI compared with rHDL. These results are therefore consistent with the direct binding studies. One possible explanation for the differences in binding of the three rHDL types is that their rates of dissociation from SR-BI during the washing of cells at 4 °C, following incubation with the ligand, vary significantly. Rates of ligand dissociation at 4 °C were measured in Fig. 5. POPC-containing ligands were first bound at 4 °C to CHO-SRBI cells, rapidly washed free of unbound ligand within 5 min, and then incubated for increasing periods before determining the cell-associated label. During the subsequent 4 °C incubation of the washed cells, there was a significant but relatively slow dissociation of each of the bound ligands (2–12% dissociation of cell-bound ligand/h). However, the relative levels of binding of the three ligands remained similar throughout the incubation period, indicating that the observed binding differences between the ligands do not result from differences in the rates of ligand dissociation during the washing step that follows incubation with ligand. We next assessed the influence of apoA-II on the ability of apoA-I-containing particles to deliver CE to cells by SR-BI. AI-rHDL and AI/AII-rHDL were compared as ligands for SR-BI-mediated CE uptake using rHDL ligands that were double-labeled with 125I- and [3H]CE. These particles contained 3 mol % of CE. Fig.6 shows the binding of and selective CE uptake from double-labeled DPPC-containing particles (1 μg/ml) as a function of time. In these experiments, selective CE uptake is calculated from the amount of cell-associated [3H]CE that was not accounted for by whole particle binding (quantified from cell association of 125I-rHDL protein). Selective CE uptake is expressed in terms of apparent rHDL protein uptake (apoA-I equivalents) assuming uptake occurred only through the uptake of whole particles (44Pittman R.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor C.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, SR-BI-specific association of 125I-label was significantly greater for AI-rHDL than for AI/AII-rHDL. For both ligands, total [3H]CE uptake over the 2-h incubation exceeded the corresponding amount of 125I cell association. Thus, uptake of [3H]CE from both types of rHDL occurred in a selective manner. Whereas binding was 2-fold greater for AI-rHDL than AI/AII-rHDL at 2 h, selective uptake of CE from AI-rHDL was only 40% higher. Thus, the efficiency of selective uptake from bound particles was greater in the case of AI/AII-rHDL. The efficiency of selective uptake can be defined as selective uptake relative to the amount of surface-bound ligand (calculated from 125I cell association). In five experiments, the efficiency of selective uptake from AI/AII-rHDL was ∼2-fold higher than from AI-rHDL. SR-BI-specific selective uptake from AI-rHDL and AI/AII rHDL reconstituted with POPC was also compared (Figs.7 and 8). 125I-rHDL a"

We have recently shown that origins fire throughout the S phase in Xenopusegg extracts. To study the temporal regulation of origin firing, we have analyzed origin activation in sperm nuclei treated with the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin. Sperm chromatin was incubated inXenopus egg extracts in the presence of aphidicolin and transferred to a fresh extract, and digoxigenin-dUTP and biotin-dUTP were added at various times after aphidicolin release to selectively label early and late replicating DNA. Molecular combing analysis of single DNA fibers showed that only a fraction of potential origins were able to initiate in the presence of aphidicolin. After release from aphidicolin, the remaining origins fired asynchronously throughout the S phase. Therefore, initiation during the S phase depends on the normal progression of replication forks assembled at earlier activated origins. Caffeine, an inhibitor of the checkpoint kinases ATR and ATM, did not relieve the aphidicolin-induced block to origin firing. We conclude that a caffeine-insensitive intra-S phase checkpoint regulates origin activation when DNA synthesis is inhibited inXenopus egg extracts.

Riggs A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 32: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In most cells, replication initiates at specific sequences, and distinct origins fire at different times in the S phase (2Gilbert D.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 3Pasero P. Schwob E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We are interested in developmental transitions in origin usage and the replication timing program in Xenopus. Studies usingDrosophila and Xenopus have provided information about the regulation of origin spacing and specificity. In the rapidly cleaving early embryos of both organisms, origins are closely spaced and lack any detectable sequence specificity (4Blumenthal A.B. Kriegstein H.J. Hogness D.S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1974; 38: 205-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 5Shinomiya T. Ina S.

After the midblastula transition (MBT),1 when a critical number of nuclei accumulate in the embryo (7Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), cell cycles become slower, zygotic transcription is activated, and fewer but more specific origins are used (8Hyrien O. Maric C. Méchali M. Science. 1995; 270: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 9Sasaki T. Sawado T. Yamaguchi M. Shinomiya T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 547-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This restriction occurs in part by inactivation of origins located within transcription units. Further restriction of origin usage and specification of replication fork pausing sites occur later in development (10Maric C. Levacher B. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Treatments that block the progression of the replication forks from the early firing origins inhibit the firing of the late origins in yeast and mammals. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the block to late origin firing (also called the intra-S phase checkpoint) requires the cell cycle checkpoint genes MEC1 and RAD53 (11Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar,12Shirahige K. Hori Y. Shiraishi K. Yamashita M. Takahashi K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Nature. 1998; 395: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In mammals, caffeine and 2-aminopurine were recently shown to interfere with an intra-S checkpoint that prevents replication initiation within late replicating chromosomal domains in cells treated with aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerases (13Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Caffeine and 2-aminopurine have been previously reported to abrogate a distinct, so-called S/M checkpoint that normally prevents cells arrested with inhibitors of DNA synthesis to enter mitosis (14Schlegel R. Pardee A.B. Science. 1986; 232: 1264-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Targets of caffeine are the checkpoint kinases ATM (ataxia-telangectasia-mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3 related), which are the vertebrate homologues of Mec1 (S. cerevisiae), Rad3 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and Tel1 (S. pombe or S. cerevisiae) (15Hall-Jackson C.A. Cross D.A. Morrice N. Smythe C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6707-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Blasina A. Price B.D. Turenne G.A. McGowan C.H. Curr.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the Mec1/Rad53 pathway also contributes to maintain the inactivity of “dormant” origins, and it has been speculated that the inactivation of replication origins inDrosophila and Xenopus may be due to the acquisition of an intra-S checkpoint at the MBT (18Santocanale C. Sharma K. Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would be interesting to determine whether there is an intra-S checkpoint in Xenopus egg extracts, which are known to initiate replication without detectable sequence specificity (19Hyrien O. Méchali M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Mahbubani H.M. Paull T. Elder J.K. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Lucas I. Chevrier-Miller M. Sogo J.M. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the acquisition of a replication timing program is concomitant with the developmental restriction of origin usage. Electron microscopy analysis of replicating DNA fromDrosophila embryos suggested that origins fire synchronously at the syncitial blastoderm stage but become asynchronous at cellularization (MBT) (4Blumenthal A.B. Kriegstein H.J. Hogness D.S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1974; 38: 205-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22McKnight S.L. Miller Jr., O.L. Cell. 1977; 12: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Different results were obtained when the replication of plasmid DNA or sperm nuclei in Xenopus egg extracts was examined. Although small (<10 kb) plasmid molecules support a single, randomly located initiation event in egg extracts (19Hyrien O. Méchali M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Mahbubani H.M. Paull T. Elder J.K. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), large plasmids undergo multiple initiation events, as shown by two-dimensional gel and electron microscopy analyses (21Lucas I. Chevrier-Miller M. Sogo J.M. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast to Drosophila embryos, these multiple initiation events are not synchronous but occur throughout the S phase, despite the dwindling length of the unreplicated DNA remaining available for initiation as replication approaches completion (21Lucas I. Chevrier-Miller M. Sogo J.M. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similar conclusions were obtained when the replication of sperm nuclei was examined by molecular combing (23Herrick J. Stanislawski P. Hyrien O. Bensimon A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These studies showed that the frequency of initiation actually increases during the S phase, ensuring rapid and complete genome replication despite the lack of sequence specificity for initiation. The evidence for asynchronous initiation in Xenopus egg extracts raises the question of how the time of activation of any individual origin is determined. A simple model would be that potential origins are abundant and equally competent to fire at any time during the S phase. The frequency of initiation during the S phase would increase because of the progressive concentration of a factor required to trigger initiation at individual origins into nuclei (21Lucas I. Chevrier-Miller M. Sogo J.M. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a more complex temporal regulation could distinguish “early” and “late” firing origins. To gain further insight into the regulation of the S phase inXenopus egg extracts, we have examined the effect of aphidicolin on origin usage in sperm nuclei replicating in egg extracts. In the absence of an intra-S checkpoint, aphidicolin would block fork progression but would not restrict the activation of all potential origins. Upon release from the inhibitor, elongation would synchronously resume at all origins. However, we find that during the aphidicolin block only a fraction of origins can fire, and upon release from the block, the remaining origins still fire asynchronously. This shows that an intra-S checkpoint is functional in Xenopusegg extracts and argues against a regulation of origin firing solely through the concentration of some origin-triggering factor into nuclei. The potential implications of this checkpoint in ensuring rapid and complete genome replication by controlling the number of simultaneously active forks and its participation in a replication timing program are discussed. Replication-competent extracts from unfertilizedXenopus eggs were prepared as described (24Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Samples for molecular combing analysis were prepared as follows. For control reactions, sperm nuclei (final concentration, 2000/μl) were incubated in fresh extracts in the presence of cycloheximide (250 μg/ml), energy mix (7.5 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mmATP, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.7, 1 mmMgCl2), 20 μm digoxigenin-dUTP (added att = 0), and 20 μm biotin-dUTP (added att = 25, 40, and 50 min) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Replication was allowed to continue for 2 h. For the aphidicolin block and release experiments, sperm nuclei (final concentration, 2000/μl) were incubated in fresh extracts in the presence of aphidicolin (100 μg/ml), energy mix, and cycloheximide. After 2 h nuclei were resuspended in 1 ml of washing buffer (50 mmKCl, 50 mm Hepes KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), pelleted at 1000 × g for 2 min, resuspended, and pelleted again (20Mahbubani H.M. Paull T. Elder J.K. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Washed nuclei were then added to fresh extract supplemented with cycloheximide and energy mix and were allowed to continue replication for 2 h in the presence of 20 μm digoxigenin-dUTP (added at t = 0) and 20 μm biotin-dUTP (added at t = 10, 20, and 30 min) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The kinetics of entry into the S phase (see Fig.1 A) was monitored by direct fluorescence microscopy of the same nuclei in the same extracts supplemented with 20 μmrhodamin-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA was extracted and combed as described (23Herrick J. Stanislawski P. Hyrien O. Bensimon A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Michalet X. Ekong R. Fougerousse F. Rousseaux S. Schurra C. Hornigold N. van Slegtenhorst M. Wolfe J. Povey S. Beckmann J.S. Bensimon A. Science. 1997; 277: 1518-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The incorporated digoxigenin and biotin labels were simultaneously detected with fluorescent antibodies with FITC for the digoxigenin label and Texas Red for the biotin label, using five successive layers of antibodies as described (23Herrick J. Stanislawski P. Hyrien O. Bensimon A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Samples were viewed in a fluorescence microscope (Leitz DMRB), and images of the combed DNA molecules were acquired using a CCD camera (Hamamatsu C5985). The fields of view were chosen at random. The size of most photographed molecules was 120 kb. All of the photographed fibers showed a continuous FITC label, indicating complete replication. Measurements were made on each molecule using MAC BAS V2.5 software (Fuji). Replication eyes were defined as regions replicated before addition of biotin-dUTP and appeared as gaps of unstained DNA when viewed under the Texas Red filter and as regions stained with FITC only on superimposed Texas Red + FITC images. Control experiments showed that gaps of unstained DNA need to be >2 kb to be convincingly identified as replication eyes, and smaller gaps were not considered significant. The replication extent of each fiber was calculated as the sum of replication eyes divided by the total length of the molecule. The distances between the midpoints of adjacent nonstained segments (eye to eye distances) were then separately determined. Measurements were classified according to the extent that the molecule has undergone replication. Sperm nuclei were incubated in the presence of 100 μg/ml aphidicolin for 2 h and released into fresh extract. At different time points after the release 1/12.5 volume of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was added, and replication was stopped 2 min later by the addition of DNAZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol minimizing DNA strand breakage during sample preparation. The pellets were resuspended and electrophoresed on alkaline-agarose gels (1.1% agarose, 50 mm NaOH, 2 mm EDTA) at 2 V/cm for 17 h. The gels were fixed in 7% trichloroacetic acid, dried, exposed to Fuji BAS MP 2040S imaging plates, and analyzed on a Fuji BAS 1000 phosphorimager. When sperm chromatin is incubated in Xenopus egg extract, it is assembled into normal interphase nuclei surrounded by a nuclear envelope and replicated semiconservatively (24Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). DNA replication starts after a typical 15–30-min lag (Fig.1 A) immediately upon closure of the nuclear membrane and is complete 30 min later. To visualize the firing of the replication origins and the progression of the replication forks in the Xenopus in vitro system, we used molecular combing of single DNA molecules. This technique (25Michalet X. Ekong R. Fougerousse F. Rousseaux S. Schurra C. Hornigold N. van Slegtenhorst M. Wolfe J. Povey S. Beckmann J.S. Bensimon A. Science. 1997; 277: 1518-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 26Bensimon A. Simon A. Chiffaudel A. Croquette V. Heslot F. Bensimon D. Science. 1994; 265: 2096-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) allows the efficient and reproducible stretching and irreversible fixation of DNA molecules onto silanized microscope glass slides. DNA molecules prepared in this way are parallel, straight, and homogeneously stretched (1 μm = 2 kb), eliminating the need for arbitrary selection of appropriately spread fibers and internal length calibration inherent to other fiber spreading techniques (25Michalet X. Ekong R. Fougerousse F. Rousseaux S. Schurra C. Hornigold N. van Slegtenhorst M. Wolfe J. Povey S. Beckmann J.S. Bensimon A. Science. 1997; 277: 1518-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Sperm chromatin is replicated in Xenopus egg extracts in the presence of digoxigenin-dUTP, and biotin-dUTP is added at different time points to differentially label early (digoxigenin-dUTP only) and late (digoxigenin-dUTP plus biotin-dUTP) replicating sequences. After a 2-h incubation, the fully replicated genomic DNA is purified and combed, and the digoxigenin and biotin labels are revealed with appropriate green (FITC) and red (Texas Red) fluorescing antibodies. It is thereby possible to monitor the progression of replication eyes and origin distances during the S phase on individual DNA molecules (23Herrick J. Stanislawski P. Hyrien O. Bensimon A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we used this method to examine how the sequence of origin activation in egg extracts is affected by aphidicolin block and release of the replication forks (Fig. 1). Aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerases α and δ, inhibits the processive elongation of DNA nascent strands but does not prevent the initiation of DNA replication and the formation of short nascent strands (100–300 nucleotides) as analyzed by alkaline gel electrophoresis (Refs. 27Nethanel T. Kaufmann G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5912-5918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 28Mahbubani H.M. Chong J.P. Chevalier S. Thommes P. Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and data not shown). In a control experiment, sperm nuclei (2000/μl) were incubated inXenopus egg extracts in the presence of 100 μg/ml aphidicolin and biotin-dUTP for 2 h. The DNA was isolated, combed, and stained with the general DNA stain YOYO-1 and with anti-biotin antibodies. These DNA fibers did not contain any detectable incorporation of biotin-dUTP (not shown). Alkaline gel electrophoresis after [α-32P]dATP incorporation confirmed that replication was inhibited by 99% and that the size of the nascent strands was around 300 nucleotides, a size too small to visualize by molecular combing. At lower aphidicolin concentrations (30 μg/ml) fibers eventually contained stretches of labeled DNA, suggesting a less complete replication block. Therefore, all of the following experiments were performed at 100 μg/ml aphidicolin. The resumption of DNA replication after washing and transfer of the aphidicolin-treated nuclei into fresh extract without aphidicolin was visualized in a control experiment by the incorporation of rhodamin-dUTP and counting of labeled nuclei (Fig. 1 A). All nuclei incorporated label within 2 min, whereas nuclei not treated with aphidicolin asynchronously entered the S phase over a time window of about 15 min. This clearly shows a synchronization of nuclei after release from an aphidicolin block. To monitor complete DNA synthesis digoxigenin-dUTP was added to the nuclei from the start of the release. Biotin-dUTP was added at 10, 20, or 30 min, and replication was allowed to proceed for up to 2 h (Fig. 1 B). DNA of these three samples was isolated and subjected to molecular combing (Fig.1 C). A total of 26 Mb of DNA was analyzed, and the measurements were performed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Only molecules that were fully labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP were selected. When the fibers were visualized for biotin-dUTP using the Texas Red filter, eyes of early replicated DNA appeared as nonstained regions between red-labeled stretches of late replicated DNA (Fig. 1 C). Eye lengths and eye to eye distances (ETED; defined as the distances between the two midpoints of two adjacent replication eyes; Fig. 1 B) were measured, and the replication extent was calculated for each fiber. The mean values of these parameters were calculated separately for each time after release. As expected, the overall replication extent of fibers (10 min, 23.7 ± 14.9%; 20 min, 32.1 ± 18.8%; and 30 min, 46.2 ± 21.8%) and the length of replication eyes (10 min, 5.5 ± 3.4 kb; 20 min, 9.1 ± 3.0 kb; and 30 min, 12.7 ± 12.1 kb) increased with time after release because of S phase progression. Individual DNA fibers of each time point were ranked according to their replication extent, and eye lengths were plotted against the molecule rank (Fig. 2). If aphidicolin did not perturb origin activation, all of the potential origins would have initiated during the 2-h aphidicolin block (the S phase is normally completed in <1 h), and elongation would synchronously proceed from these origins after release from the block. Consequently, eye lengths would be uniform, and the replication extents of individual fibers would show a fairly homogeneous increase with S phase progression. However, we observed that the earliest time point (10 min) contained fibers with small but broadly dispersed eye sizes (2–10 kb) and replication extents (15–50%) (Fig. 2 A). Given that fork speed has been estimated to 0.5 kb/min in this system, the few eyes larger than 10 kb at this point probably originate from a small number of mergers. At 20 min (Fig. 2 B) and 30 min (Fig.2 C), the distributions of eye lengths and replication extents broadened further. Importantly, small eyes (i.e. new initiation events) were still abundant even 20 and 30 min after release from the replication block. These results suggest that some potential origins were prevented from initiating in the presence of aphidicolin but retained the capacity to initiate at various times during the S phase after the release of the block. An alternative interpretation could be that all origins fired during the aphidicolin block but that elongation asynchronously resumed at preinitiated origins after release. To test this hypothesis, nascent strand synthesis during the aphidicolin block was examined by alkaline gel electrophoresis and quantified by phosphorimager analysis or by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. In the presence of 100 μg/ml aphidicolin DNA replication was reduced to 1% of the control, and nascent strand synthesis stalled after 300–400 nucleotide were polymerized (data not shown). This leads to an estimation of only one activated origin every 30–40 kb, in agreement with the eye to eye distances observed by molecular combing (see below). Normal origin spacing has been estimated to be about 10 kb in this system (6Hyrien O. Méchali M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4511-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Lucas I. Chevrier-Miller M. Sogo J.M. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These data suggest that only 25–33% of all origins actually fired in the presence of aphidicolin. The fact that at 30 min after release fibers showed a wide range (3–83%) of replication extents confirms and extends the notion that origins do not fire synchronously in all regions of the genome (taking into consideration that the length of the photographed molecules is 120 kb). The distribution of eye lengths at different time points changed even when fibers of similar replication extent were compared (Fig. 2). Ten minutes after the release fibers mainly contained small replication eyes, whereas at 20 and 30 min, fibers of similar replication extent contained fewer but larger eyes. This demonstrates that fibers taken from different stages of the S phase can show identical replication extents because of different temporal sequences of origin activation. However, the visual inspection of single 120-kb fibers (Fig.1 C) and of several randomly selected longer fibers (300–500 kb; Fig. 2 D) did not suggest a marked local synchrony of neighboring origins. Control nuclei entered into the S phase much less synchronously than nuclei released from an aphidicolin block (Fig. 1 A). To compare S phase progression in both conditions, the fibers from all time points in the experiment above were pooled and compared with the pooled fibers from nuclei replicated without aphidicolin pretreatment. The fibers were ranked by replication extent, and the eye lengths of each fiber were plotted against its replication extent (Fig.3). A heterogeneous distribution of eye lengths was observed at all replication extents in both samples. This confirms that initiation occurs asynchronously during the S phase in both conditions. However, after treatment with aphidicolin, the distribution of eye lengths was shifted toward larger eyes, and the mean eye length was 1.3–1.7-fold larger than in control fibers. This could result from a lower rate of initiation, a higher rate of eye fusion, or both. To further investigate this point, the mean density of new replication eyes (2–8 kb) relative to the amount of DNA remaining to be replicated was calculated for each replication class. This parameter measures the frequency of initiation according to replication extent. The frequency of initiation at identical replication extents was about 2.5-fold lower after aphidicolin release than in control nuclei (Fig. 4). Thus, a smaller fraction of potential origins fired after release from the block. Nevertheless, the frequency of initiation increased about 8-fold as replication progressed, both in control nuclei and after aphidicolin release. We conclude that (i) stalling replication forks assembled at early origins blocks the firing of later origins and (ii) once the block is relieved, origins are still activated asynchronously as in the control nuclei, albeit with reduced efficiency. These results suggest the existence of an origin firing checkpoint in Xenopus egg extracts.Figure 4The frequency of initiation after release from aphidicolin is lower but increases during the S phase. The number of replication eyes smaller than 8 kb/fiber was divided by the length of DNA that remained to be replicated. This measures the frequency of initiation according to the percentage of replication of the fiber. Mean values for nonsynchronized nuclei (squares) and synchronized nuclei (triangles) were calculated after grouping fibers into equal intervals according to replication extent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm by a different method that initiation occurs throughout the S phase after release from an aphidicolin block, we developed a nascent strand assay using a short radiolabel pulse. Sperm nuclei were released from an aphidicolin block, equal amounts of nuclei were pulsed for 2 min with [α-32P]dATP at various times after release, and DNA was isolated and separated by alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.5). Replication elongation started immediately after the release as seen by nascent strands ranging between 100 and 1000 nucleotides. As replication proceeded, larger nascent strands became predominant, but small nascent strands (100–1000 nucleotides) were still detectable at 20 and 30 min. After 30 min small nascent strands were no longer observed, although incorporation of label in higher molecular weight products was still detected at 45, 60, and 120 min after release. Nevertheless, when nuclei were pulse-labeled with rhodamin-dUTP and observed by fluorescence microscopy, a significant signal was seen up to 45–60 min but not later (data not shown). This suggests that the S phase lasted for 45–60 min in most nuclei and that the signal observed by32P incorporation at 120 min was due to rare, residual DNA synthesis. In a parallel control experiment, an equivalent sample of continuously labeled DNA was analyzed (Fig. 5, lane C). No small strands were detected. Thus, the small strands detected in Fig. 5are true replication intermediates and not unspecific background because of, for example, strand breakage during sample manipulation. Eukaryotic genomes often contain more potential origins than are actually used during the S phase. In yeast, treatments that block fork progression can contribute to activate dormant origins (18Santocanale C. Sharma K. Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether additional origins could initiate when the replication forks are blocked by aphidicolin, we analyzed the distribution of origins after release from the block. All fibers were ranked by replication extent, and the ETED value of each fiber was plotted against its replication extent in experiments with (Fig.6 A) or without aphidicolin treatment (Fig. 6 B). The mean ETED for each replication class is plotted in Fig. 6 C. In both experiments, ETED on fibers with a low replication extent were large, showing that only few initiations had occurred, and ETED decre"

It has been suggested that a complex of the γ subunit and c ring (c10–14) of F0F1 could rotate together during ATP hydrolysis and synthesis (Sambongi, Y., Iko, Y., Tanabe, M., Omote, H., Iwamoto-Kihara, A., Ueda, I., Yanagida, T., Wada, Y., and Futai, M. (1999) Science 286, 1722–1724). We observed that the rotation of the c ring with the cI28T mutation (c subunit cIle-28 replaced by Thr) was less sensitive to venturicidin than that of the wild type, consistent with the antibiotic effect on the cI28T mutant and wild-type ATPase activities (Fillingame, R. H., Oldenburg, M., and Fraga, D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20934–20939). Furthermore, we engineered F0F1to see the α3β3 hexamer rotation; a biotin tag was introduced into the α or β subunit, and a His tag was introduced into the c subunit. The engineered enzymes could be purified by metal affinity chromatography and density gradient centrifugation. They were immobilized on a glass surface through thec subunit, and an actin filament was connected to the α or β subunit. The filament rotated upon the addition of ATP and generated essentially the same frictional torque as one connected to the c ring. These results indicate that the γεc10–14 complex is a mechanical unit of the enzyme and that it can be used as a rotor or a stator experimentally, depending on the subunit immobilized.

The amino- and carboxyl-terminal α helices of the γ subunit occupy the central space of the α3β3 hexamer, as shown by the high resolution structure (7Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The catalytic sites in the three β subunits participate alternately in ATP synthesis and also in hydrolysis, as predicted from the binding change mechanism (6Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev.

The mechanism also proposes that the γ subunit rotation plays a major role in the conformational transmission among the β subunits.The roles of the γ subunit in energy coupling and catalytic cooperativity have been shown by extensive genetic studies (2Futai M Omote H Handbook of Biological Physics.in: Konings W. N Kaback H. R Lolkema J. S Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. 2. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 47-74Google Scholar). Mutation and suppression studies have suggested that the γ subunit carboxyl-terminal domain and amino-terminal Met-23 interact through long range conformational transmissions involving the movement of the two helices (8Nakamoto R.K.

Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Continuous rotation has been observed directly as the movement of an actin filament connected to the γ subunit in the F1 sector (12Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K.

Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19375-19377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, this enzyme can be defined as a biological nanomotor carrying out rotational catalysis (16Wada Y. Sambongi Y. Futai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In ATP hydrolysis, the mechanical work done by the γ subunit rotation should be transmitted to the F0 sector for ATP-dependent proton transport. During ATP synthesis, proton transport should drive the γ subunit rotation, which causes the β subunit conformational change to release the product ATP. Therefore, it is essential to determine how the γ subunit rotation is coupled to the proton transport through F0.Studies on the F0 sector involving electron (17Birkenhäger R. Hoppert M.

We recently provided the first direct evidence that the c ring rotates continuously together with the γ subunit in F0F1 (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar); F0F1 was immobilized on a glass surface through His tags connected to the α subunits, and an actin filament was attached to the c ring. Pänke et al. (33Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated the c ring rotation more recently using a different experimental system. The x-ray structure of the yeast enzyme showed the tight association between the γ subunit and thec ring, also suggesting that they can rotate together as an assembly (24Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar).As shown previously by Fillingame et al. (34Fillingame R.H. Oldenburg M. Fraga D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20934-20939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the membrane ATPase activity of the c subunit cIle-28 (cI28) to the Thr (cT28) mutant was resistant to venturicidin, an effective inhibitor of the wild type. In this study, we observed that the c ring rotation became less sensitive to venturicidin when the cI28T mutation was introduced into the c subunit. Furthermore, the α3β3 hexamer could rotate when F0F1 was immobilized through the cring. These results indicate that a complex of the εγ subunit and the c ring is a mechanical unit of the nanomotor and can be a rotor or stator in an experimental system, depending on the subunit immobilized.DISCUSSIONAs predicted by the binding change mechanism for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, the continuous rotation of the γ subunit in the F1 sector has been observed during ATP hydrolysis (12Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar, 13Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y.

Commun. 1999; 260: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The γ subunit rotation should be transmitted to the F0sector for coupling with proton transport. We provided the first evidence that the c subunit ring rotates with the γ subunit in F0F1 (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Pänke et al. (33Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated the c ring rotation more recently. The present study further confirmed the co-rotation of the γ subunit with the c ring.Fillingame et al. (34Fillingame R.H. Oldenburg M. Fraga D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20934-20939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that membrane ATPase activity (attributable to F0F1) became less sensitive when the cI28T mutation was introduced. It should be noted, however, that this antibiotic was not a strong inhibitor even for the wild-type enzyme (maximum inhibition, about 60%). We observed lower but significant inhibition of the engineered F0F1 when ATPase activity was assayed under the rotation conditions. Consistent with the results for ATPase activity, this antibiotic did not have a strong effect on the rotation, such as immediate cessation upon its addition, but rather showed specific inhibition of F0F1. An actin filament connected to the c ring showed increased pauses upon the addition of venturicidin, and the cI28T mutation decreased the inhibitor sensitivity. As described above, this antibiotic had no effect on the ATPase activity or the γ rotation of the engineered F1. These results suggest that venturicidin inhibits F0F1 rotation by binding to the cring and that a complex of the γ subunit and c ring was rotating.We tested a different engineered enzyme for rotation by introducing a His tag into the c ring and a biotin tag into the α3β3 hexamer. Thus, F0F1 was immobilized on a glass surface and connected with an actin filament without using chemistry such as cysteine residue modification with biotin-maleimide (12Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M.

Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of ATP, the actin filament connected to the α3β3 hexamer rotated counterclockwise when viewed from the F1 side and generated similar torque to the γ rotation. These results strongly suggest that the γεc10–14 complex is a mechanical unit and rotates during ATP hydrolysis and that the rotor and stator of the entire complex are interchangeable experimentally, depending on the subunit immobilized.One model for the interaction of the γ subunit with the cring during ATP synthesis and hydrolysis predicts that the γ subunit interacts with the hydrophilic loop between the transmembrane helices of each c subunit one by one during rotation (discussed in Refs. 38Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 39Altendorf K. Staltz W.D. Greie J.C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 19-28PubMed Google Scholar). The rotation of the actin filament connected to thec ring indicates that this model will not work. However, it may be possible to argue that the c ring rotated with the γ subunit as a part of the fluorescent probe (actin filament). The rotation of the filament connected to the α3β3 hexamer finally excluded this possibility because the model predicts that the filament should not rotate if the c ring is immobilized and the γ subunit moves on the ring.Tsunoda et al. (40Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have claimed that they could not connect an actin filament specifically to the c ring under their experimental conditions and criticized the experiments by Sambongiet al.

The protocols used by the two groups are different, including the positions of Cys residues introduced into the c subunit (Sambongiet al. (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reacted F0F1 with fluorescein-5-maleimide and then biotinylated anti-fluorescein IgG and the actin filament through streptavidin. On the other hand, Sambongi et al. (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) reacted F0F1 with biotin-maleimide and then connected an actin filament through streptavidin. Thus, the arguments raised by Tsunoda et al. (40Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which are based on mostly negative observations, may reflect the differences in the experimental systems. As described in this study, the conclusion of Sambongiet al. (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) is supported by Pänke et al.(33Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and the effect of venturicidin on the cI28T mutant, as described above. Furthermore, the actin filament connected to the α3β3 hexamer in the immobilized F0F1 rotated, as discussed above.In conclusion, we clearly showed that a complex of εγ and the c ring is a mechanical unit and that it rotates as an assembly. The preparations we used have all subunits of F0F1, and previous studies indicated that it is not easy to dissociate F0F1 even under conditions that release F1 from membranes (41Negrin R.S. Foster D.L. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5643-5648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic (42Friedl P. Hoppe J. Gunsalus R.P. Michelsen O. von Meyenburg K. Schairer H.U. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and reconstitution (43Schneider E. Altendorf K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) studies have suggested that the three F0 subunits (a, b, and c) are required for the formation of the F0F1 complex. However, we could not prove definitely that the rotating enzyme during video recording has the original integrity of F0F1. In this regard, Sambongi et al. (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) did not conclude that the rotating enzyme had all the subunits. Pänke et al. (33Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) stated more clearly that they might have observed the rotation of the c ring in incomplete F0F1. Although we accept this reservation as to the integrity of the rotating complex, we strongly suggest that the rotation of a complex of the γε subunit andc ring is related to the fully functional F0F1. The obvious next step is to examine subunit rotation during ATP synthesis and to detect ATP synthesis when the c ring or γ subunit is artificially rotated. ATP is synthesized in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and bacteria by a ubiquitous ATP synthase (F0F1) coupled with an electrochemical proton gradient. The F0F1 ofEscherichia coli consists of a catalytic sector, F1 (α3β3γδε), and a proton pathway, F0(ab2 c10–14) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Futai M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Annu. Rev.

Biomembr. 1996; 28: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). γ subunit rotation has been suggested by β-γ cross-linking followed by dissociation and reconstitution (10Duncan T.M.

A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and the movement of a probe attached to the carboxyl terminus of the γ subunit (11Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Continuous rotation has been observed directly as the movement of an actin filament connected to the γ subunit in the F1 sector (12Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar, 13Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1999; 260: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The rotation of the ε subunit with the γ subunit was also shown subsequently (15Kato-Yamada Y. Noji H. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19375-19377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, this enzyme can be defined as a biological nanomotor carrying out rotational catalysis (16Wada Y. Sambongi Y. Futai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In ATP hydrolysis, the mechanical work done by the γ subunit rotation should be transmitted to the F0 sector for ATP-dependent proton transport. During ATP synthesis, proton transport should drive the γ subunit rotation, which causes the β subunit conformational change to release the product ATP. Therefore, it is essential to determine how the γ subunit rotation is coupled to the proton transport through F0. Studies on the F0 sector involving electron (17Birkenhäger R. Hoppert M. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Mayer F. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and atomic force (18Takeyasu K. Omote H. Nettikadan S. Tokumasu F.

A ring formed from 12 c subunits was proposed for the E. coli enzyme from the model of the solution structure (20Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). A ring of 14 monomers was observed more recently for the chloroplast enzyme (25Seelert H. Poetsh A. Dencher N.A. Engel A. Stahlberg H. Müller D.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 418-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The rotation of the c ring with the γ subunit has been proposed (26Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol.

We recently provided the first direct evidence that the c ring rotates continuously together with the γ subunit in F0F1 (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar); F0F1 was immobilized on a glass surface through His tags connected to the α subunits, and an actin filament was attached to the c ring. Pänke et al. (33Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated the c ring rotation more recently using a different experimental system. The x-ray structure of the yeast enzyme showed the tight association between the γ subunit and thec ring, also suggesting that they can rotate together as an assembly (24Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). As shown previously by Fillingame et al. (34Fillingame R.H. Oldenburg M. Fraga D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20934-20939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the membrane ATPase activity of the c subunit cIle-28 (cI28) to the Thr (cT28) mutant was resistant to venturicidin, an effective inhibitor of the wild type. In this study, we observed that the c ring rotation became less sensitive to venturicidin when the cI28T mutation was introduced into the c subunit. Furthermore, the α3β3 hexamer could rotate when F0F1 was immobilized through the cring. These results indicate that a complex of the εγ subunit and the c ring is a mechanical unit of the nanomotor and can be a rotor or stator in an experimental system, depending on the subunit immobilized. DISCUSSIONAs predicted by the binding change mechanism for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, the continuous rotation of the γ subunit in the F1 sector has been observed during ATP hydrolysis (12Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar, 13Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y.

Commun. 1999; 260: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The γ subunit rotation should be transmitted to the F0sector for coupling with proton transport. We provided the first evidence that the c subunit ring rotates with the γ subunit in F0F1 (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Pänke et al. (33Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated the c ring rotation more recently. The present study further confirmed the co-rotation of the γ subunit with the c ring.Fillingame et al. (34Fillingame R.H. Oldenburg M. Fraga D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20934-20939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that membrane ATPase activity (attributable to F0F1) became less sensitive when the cI28T mutation was introduced. It should be noted, however, that this antibiotic was not a strong inhibitor even for the wild-type enzyme (maximum inhibition, about 60%). We observed lower but significant inhibition of the engineered F0F1 when ATPase activity was assayed under the rotation conditions. Consistent with the results for ATPase activity, this antibiotic did not have a strong effect on the rotation, such as immediate cessation upon its addition, but rather showed specific inhibition of F0F1. An actin filament connected to the c ring showed increased pauses upon the addition of venturicidin, and the cI28T mutation decreased the inhibitor sensitivity. As described above, this antibiotic had no effect on the ATPase activity or the γ rotation of the engineered F1. These results suggest that venturicidin inhibits F0F1 rotation by binding to the cring and that a complex of the γ subunit and c ring was rotating.We tested a different engineered enzyme for rotation by introducing a His tag into the c ring and a biotin tag into the α3β3 hexamer. Thus, F0F1 was immobilized on a glass surface and connected with an actin filament without using chemistry such as cysteine residue modification with biotin-maleimide (12Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M.

Upon the addition of ATP, the actin filament connected to the α3β3 hexamer rotated counterclockwise when viewed from the F1 side and generated similar torque to the γ rotation. These results strongly suggest that the γεc10–14 complex is a mechanical unit and rotates during ATP hydrolysis and that the rotor and stator of the entire complex are interchangeable experimentally, depending on the subunit immobilized.One model for the interaction of the γ subunit with the cring during ATP synthesis and hydrolysis predicts that the γ subunit interacts with the hydrophilic loop between the transmembrane helices of each c subunit one by one during rotation (discussed in Refs. 38Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 39Altendorf K. Staltz W.D. Greie J.C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 19-28PubMed Google Scholar). The rotation of the actin filament connected to thec ring indicates that this model will not work. However, it may be possible to argue that the c ring rotated with the γ subunit as a part of the fluorescent probe (actin filament). The rotation of the filament connected to the α3β3 hexamer finally excluded this possibility because the model predicts that the filament should not rotate if the c ring is immobilized and the γ subunit moves on the ring.Tsunoda et al.

The protocols used by the two groups are different, including the positions of Cys residues introduced into the c subunit (Sambongiet al. (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A.

On the other hand, Sambongi et al. (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M.

As described in this study, the conclusion of Sambongiet al. (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) is supported by Pänke et al.(33Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S.

Furthermore, the actin filament connected to the α3β3 hexamer in the immobilized F0F1 rotated, as discussed above.In conclusion, we clearly showed that a complex of εγ and the c ring is a mechanical unit and that it rotates as an assembly. The preparations we used have all subunits of F0F1, and previous studies indicated that it is not easy to dissociate F0F1 even under conditions that release F1 from membranes (41Negrin R.S. Foster D.L. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5643-5648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic (42Friedl P. Hoppe J. Gunsalus R.P. Michelsen O. von Meyenburg K. Schairer H.U. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and reconstitution (43Schneider E. Altendorf K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) studies have suggested that the three F0 subunits (a, b, and c) are required for the formation of the F0F1 complex. However, we could not prove definitely that the rotating enzyme during video recording has the original integrity of F0F1. In this regard, Sambongi et al. (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) did not conclude that the rotating enzyme had all the subunits. Pänke et al. (33Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) stated more clearly that they might have observed the rotation of the c ring in incomplete F0F1. Although we accept this reservation as to the integrity of the rotating complex, we strongly suggest that the rotation of a complex of the γε subunit andc ring is related to the fully functional F0F1. The obvious next step is to examine subunit rotation during ATP synthesis and to detect ATP synthesis when the c ring or γ subunit is artificially rotated. As predicted by the binding change mechanism for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, the continuous rotation of the γ subunit in the F1 sector has been observed during ATP hydrolysis (12Noji H. Yasuda R.

The preparations we used have all subunits of F0F1, and previous studies indicated that it is not easy to dissociate F0F1 even under conditions that release F1 from membranes (41Negrin R.S. Foster D.L. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5643-5648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic (42Friedl P. Hoppe J. Gunsalus R.P. Michelsen O. von Meyenburg K. Schairer H.U.

EMBO J. 1985; 4: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) studies have suggested that the three F0 subunits (a, b, and c) are required for the formation of the F0F1 complex. However, we could not prove definitely that the rotating enzyme during video recording has the original integrity of F0F1. In this regard, Sambongi et al. (32Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) did not conclude that the rotating enzyme had all the subunits. Pänke et al. (33Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) stated more clearly that they might have observed the rotation of the c ring in incomplete F0F1. Although we accept this reservation as to the integrity of the rotating complex, we strongly suggest that the rotation of a complex of the γε subunit andc ring is related to the fully functional F0F1. The obvious next step is to examine subunit rotation during ATP synthesis and to detect ATP synthesis when the c ring or γ subunit is artificially rotated.

The profibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), generatesextracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in contrast to intracellularreactive oxygen species production by certain mitogenic growth factors in human lung fibroblasts. To determine whether tyrosine residues in fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins may be targets of H2O2-mediated dityrosine-dependent cross-linking reactions in response to TGF-β1, we utilized fluorophore-labeled tyramide, a structurally related phenolic compound that forms dimers with tyrosine, as a probe to detect such reactions under dynamic cell culture conditions. With this approach, a distinct pattern of fluorescent labeling that seems to target ECM proteins preferentially was observed in TGF-β1-treated cells but not in control cells. This reaction required the presence of a heme peroxidase and was inhibited by catalase or diphenyliodonium (a flavoenzyme inhibitor), similar to the effect on TGF-β1-induced dityrosine formation. Exogenous addition of H2O2 to control cells that do not release extracellular H2O2 produced a similar fluorescent labeling reaction. These results support the concept that, in the presence of heme peroxidases in vivo, TGF-β1-induced H2O2 production by fibroblasts may mediate oxidative dityrosine-dependent cross-linking of ECM protein(s).

A “normal” repair response most often restores tissue architecture and maintains organ function. However, in some cases “dysregulated” repair leads to tissue fibrosis and organ failure. Cell-cell communication in this context is mediated by a network of growth factors, cytokines, and other soluble mediators (1Elias J.A. Freundlich B. Kern J.A. Rosenbloom J.

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)1 is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a central role in tissue injury/repair. Persistent or exaggerated expression and/or activation of TGF-β1 in areas of active injury/repair is linked to a number of human fibrotic diseases involving diverse organ systems (4Border W.A.

Multiple actions of TGF-β1 contribute to its profibrotic effects including its ability to transform fibroblasts both in vitroand in vivo into activated contractile phenotypes known as “myofibroblasts” (6Powell D.W.

Recent studies suggest that TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation depends on the compliance/deformability of the matrix on which cells are grown (15Arora P.D. Narani N. McCulloch C.A. Am. J.

This observation is consistent with the growing recognition that biomechanical properties of the ECM regulate cell function (17Galbraith C.G. Sheetz M.P. Curr. Opin.

We have reported previously on the ability of TGF-β1 to induceextracellular release of H2O2 in association with cell surface-associated NADH:flavin:O2oxidoreductase (NADH oxidase) activity in human lung fibroblasts (14Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The enzymatic source and regulation of this activity is unrelated to the p21ras-dependent generation ofintracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by certain mitogenic growth factors (20Thannickal V.J.

Intracellular ROS have been reported to function as signaling molecules in growth factor-induced mitogenesis (21Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34543-34546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) suggests that this effect may be mediated by intracellular O⨪2-dependent reversible oxidation of critical cysteine residues within the catalytic site of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. The precise function of TGF-β1-induced extracellular H2O2 production is yet to be determined. Our previous data indicate that although tyrosine phosphorylation regulates NADH oxidase activity/H2O2 production, H2O2 does not itself seem to mediate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in cultured lung fibroblasts (25Thannickal V.J. Aldweib K.D. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23611-23615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, TGF-β1-induced extracellular H2O2 is not associated with cell proliferation in these cells (20Thannickal V.J. Day R.M. Klinz S.G. Bastien M.C. Larios J.M. Fanburg B.L. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1741-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). H2O2 is a relatively mild oxidant in most biological systems, but it functions as a potent oxidant (by inducing dimerization) of phenolic compounds in the presence of heme peroxidases (26Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 99-101Google Scholar). This property of H2O2 is utilized for useful purposes in the formation of a protective coat, composed of highly cross-linked ECM proteins, around freshly fertilized oocytes in sea urchins and in the plant hypersensitivity response (27Shapiro B.M. Science. 1991; 252: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Bradley D.J. Kjellbom P. Lamb C.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Heinecke et al. (29Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that phagocyte-derived myeloperoxidases, which normally convert H2O2 to hypochlorous acid, are capable of catalyzing similar reactions in human atherosclerotic plaques. Based on the availability of heme peroxidases (such as phagocyte-derived myeloperoxidases) in the extracellular milieu of “activated” fibroblasts, we postulated that extracellular H2O2 production by these cells may mediate similar reactions involving the phenolic amino acidl-tyrosine. In this study, we examined the ability of TGF-β1 to induce dimerization of exogenous l-tyrosine by H2O2/heme peroxidase-dependent oxidation. Moreover, the possibility that this reaction may target endogenous protein targets under dynamic conditions in which cultured fibroblasts are actively generating extracellular H2O2 was assessed utilizing a novel fluorescent labeling approach that identifies susceptible tyrosine residues. All cell culture experiments were performed on normal human fetal lung fibroblasts (IMR-90; Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ). Cells were plated on 35-mm Petri dishes at a density of 105 cells/dish and incubated in 5% CO2, 95% air. For fluoroscopy-based assays, cells were plated on microscope glass slides sterilely placed in Petri dishes. Cells were maintained in medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), and fungizone (Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium was changed every 3 days. Cells were grown to 80–100% confluency and serum-deprived for 48 h prior to assays. Porcine platelet-derived TGF-β1 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All other reagents including l-tyrosine were from Sigma. Dityrosine formation was measured by a fluorometric assay described by Heinecke et al. (30Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke H.L. d. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The feasibility and reliability of this method in our cell culture system was determined first. Known concentrations of H2O2 (0–3 μm) were added to a reaction mixture containing 1 mml-tyrosine, 5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). After a 5-min incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.1 m glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 12.0, and the final pH was adjusted to 10.0. Fluorescence of the samples was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 325 and 410, respectively. Values were recorded as relative fluorescence with the sample buffer containing no H2O2 as reference (“0” value, Fig. 2, inset). For dityrosine measurements in cell culture, cells were washed first with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the same HBSS-based reaction mixture containing l-tyrosine and HRP for 1 h at 37 °C. The overlying medium was then removed, the pH was adjusted to 10.0 with 0.1 m glycine-NaOH buffer, and fluorescence was measured as described above. Samples with the reaction mixture alone (without cells) that were processed similarly served as control and the reference against which the relative fluorescence for each of the experimental samples was recorded. “Spontaneous” dityrosine formation was not observed in these control samples. To detect tyrosine cross-linking on endogenous protein substrates, we utilized a commercially available laboratory reagent designed for signal amplification protocols. This reagent, tyramide, labeled with fluorescein (tyramide-FITC, TSA™ Fluorescence Systems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), is distributed as “TSA” kits for amplification of HRP-generated signals in immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization assays (31Speel E.J. Hopman A.H. Komminoth P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Specifically, HRP, in the presence of exogenously added H2O2 (found in the “amplification diluent” provided with the TSA kit), catalyzes the “cross-linking” of tyramide-FITC with tyrosine residues of proteins in close proximity to the site of enzyme (HRP) catalysis. This reportedly results in the deposition of the fluorophore at or near the site of the bound antibody-HRP conjugate resulting in “amplification” of the signal (31Speel E.J. Hopman A.H. Komminoth P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). An important feature of this assay is the absolute requirement for exogenous H2O2 to mediate these HRP-catalyzed cross-linking reactions. By eliminating exogenous H2O2 from the reaction, we have exploited this property of tyramide-FITC to localize “susceptible” tyrosine residues on cellular or extracellular proteins to mediate similar cross-linking reactions in response to endogenouscytokine-generated H2O2 in cultured lung fibroblasts. Cultured cells grown on Petri dishes were washed first with HBSS and incubated with 1 ml of HBSS containing 1 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 5 units/ml HRP, and 1:1000 dilution of freshly reconstituted tyramide-FITC. Tyramide-FITC was supplied by the manufacturer as lyophilized powder (weight not indicated). Initial reconstitution was with Me2SO using the 1:10 volume recommended by the manufacturer. The final concentration of tyramide-FITC used in our assays amounted to one-half that recommended for use in signal amplification protocols (kit insert, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The amplification diluent (which contains H2O2) provided with the TSA kit was discarded and is not required for this application. Cells were allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37 °C in the buffer solution containing tyramide-FITC and HRP. Cells then were washed two times with HBSS and visualized (and photographed) with a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss IM 35 inverted microscope, Oberkochen, Germany). Data from the various groups were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were made using the Student's t test for unpaired samples. For studies involving more than two groups, two-way analysis of variance was determined using the Scheffe's test (GB-STAT, Dynamic Microsystems, Silver Spring, MD). Statistical significance in all cases was defined as p < 0.05. The ability of H2O2 in the presence of heme peroxidases such as HRP to induce oxidative dimerization of phenolic compounds is well established (Fig. 1 a; see Ref.26Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 99-101Google Scholar for details). We hypothesized that TGF-β1, by stimulating H2O2 production in lung fibroblasts, may mediate a similar effect on the phenolic amino acid,l-tyrosine. First, the feasibility of measuring dityrosine formation in our cell culture system using the method described by Heinecke et al. (30Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke H.L. d. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was verified by adding increasing concentrations of H2O2 (0–3 μm) to assay medium containing l-tyrosine (1 mm) and HRP (5 units/ml) for 5 min followed by an assessment of dityrosine formation (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). A dose-dependent linear relationship between H2O2 concentration and dityrosine formation was observed (Fig. 2, inset). When HRP or l-tyrosine was excluded from the reaction, dityrosine formation was not detectable (results not shown). To determine then whether physiological concentrations of H2O2 generated by cytokine-stimulated fibroblasts are capable of inducing l-tyrosine dimerization, the same assay medium (with and without HRP) was added to TGF-β1-treated fibroblasts at the peak time point when these cells have been shown to actively release H2O2 into the overlying media (14Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In the presence of HRP, dityrosine formation was stimulated markedly in TGF-β1-treated cells, whereas it was undetectable in control cells (Fig. 2). The elimination of HRP from the reaction mixture resulted in undetectable dityrosine formation, indicating the requirement for peroxidative chemistry to mediate this reaction and supporting the general reaction mechanism shown in Fig.1 a. In further support of this, the substitution of catalase in place of HRP failed to generate any dityrosine (Fig. 2). Additionally, cotreatment of catalase (1000 units/ml) withHRP significantly inhibited TGF-β1-induced dityrosine formation (Fig.2). Relatively high concentrations of catalase were required for inhibition, most likely related to the fact that catalase has to “compete” with HRP for H2O2, and the rate constants for these reactions are several orders of magnitude higher for HRP than for catalase (32Saunders B.C. Holmes-Siedle A.G. Stark B.P. Peroxidase: The Properties and Uses of a Versitile Enzyme and of Some Related Catalysts. Butterworths, Washington, D. C.1964Google Scholar). Almost complete inhibition of TGF-β1-induced dityrosine formation was observed when cells were preincubated with diphenyliodonium (DPI, 10 μm, added 15 min prior to measurement), a flavoprotein inhibitor that blocks TGF-β1-induced H2O2 production (14Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results indicate the ability of H2O2 generated by TGF-β1-stimulated fibroblasts to mediate HRP-catalyzed dimerization reactions involving the phenolic amino acid l-tyrosine in the extracellular milieu of cultured fibroblasts. Given the finding that the TGF-β1-induced H2O2 is capable of inducing dimerization of exogenous l-tyrosine, we hypothesized that such reactions might occur on tyrosine residues of endogenous cellular or extracellular proteins. We utilized a novel approach to test this hypothesis by making use of a fluorophore-labeled phenolic compound (tyramide-FITC) that undergoes similar reactions to those described forp-substituted phenolic compounds (Fig. 1 a; see Fig. 1 b for structural comparisons of tyrosine and tyramide). In fact, this property of tyramide is the basis for its utilization in signal amplification (31Speel E.J. Hopman A.H. Komminoth P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This reagent was added to the same HBSS-based assay medium used in the l-tyrosine experiments described above. The amplification diluent provided with the assay kits for signal amplification was not used (because it contains H2O2; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fig. 3demonstrates the characteristic fluorescent pattern observed when TGF-β1-treated cells are incubated with tyramide-FITC and HRP. Similar to TGF-β1-induced dityrosine formation, the elimination of HRP from the reaction resulted in a loss of the fluorescent signal (Fig. 3). Both catalase and DPI significantly inhibited the fluorescent signal generated by the tyramide-FITC/HRP system (Fig. 3), suggesting a requirement for H2O2 to mediate this effect. These results suggest that TGF-β1-stimulated H2O2, in the presence of a heme peroxidase, is capable of mediating cross-linking reactions between tyramide-FITC and tyrosine residues of fibroblast or fibroblast-derived proteins. Based on the localization of this fluorescent labeling reaction and pattern of distribution, the protein(s) that are “targeted” by this reaction seem to reside primarily in the ECM. The effect of adding H2O2exogenously to control cells (not treated with TGF-β1) that do not generate extracellular H2O2 on tyrosine cross-linking utilizing the same tyramide-FITC assay system was examined. Cells were exposed to varying concentrations of H2O2 in the assay medium containing HRP and tyramide-FITC for 5 min (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fig. 4 demonstrates a dose-dependent effect of H2O2 on fluorescent labeling intensity. The pattern of fluorescent labeling was similar to that observed with endogenous H2O2production in TGF-β1-treated cells, suggesting that the same ECM proteins may be targeted by these cross-linking reactions. Growth factors and cytokines are now well recognized to induce the generation of ROS in a variety of nonphagocytic cells for the purposes of cell signaling and in regulation of normal physiological processes (reviewed in Ref. 33Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological effects of ROS are likely to depend on several factors including the specific reactive species (e.g. O⨪2 versusH2O2) and its concentration, kinetics, and site of production. The latter factor may be relevant particularly to ROS actions because of the inherently high reactivity of these molecules in biological systems. Thus, the chemistry of specific ROS and the microenvironment in which they are produced may be key determinants of their biological targets and effects. In this study, we show that “physiological” concentrations of H2O2 generated by TGF-β1-stimulated fibroblasts are capable of mediating dimerization ofl-tyrosine by a peroxidative mechanism. Moreover, this reaction seems to target tyrosine residues on endogenous protein substrates, suggesting that this mechanism might be important for mediating oxidative cross-linking of proteins under certain physiologic/pathologic conditions. This is the first report, to our knowledge, that demonstrates oxidative cross-linking reactions in response to cytokine-generated ROS. Interestingly, the ability of H2O2 to mediate such reactions on tyrosine residues of ECM proteins has been well demonstrated in the so-called oxidative burst of fertilization to protect the freshly fertilized sea urchin oocyte (27Shapiro B.M. Science. 1991; 252: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and to prevent pathogen spread in the “plant hypersensitivity response” (34Levine A. Tenhaken R. Dixon R. Lamb C. Cell. 1994; 79: 583-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). Such examples of a physiologic “defense mechanism” in humans are lacking. The best, and likely only, known example of a “purposeful” role for H2O2 in humans of heme peroxidase-catalyzed dimerization reactions involving tyrosine is in the biosynthesis of thyroxine, which is catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase (35Gorin Y. Leseney A.M. Ohayon R. Dupuy C. Pommier J. Virion A. Deme D. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 36De Deken X. Wang D. Many M.C. Costagliola S. Libert F. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Miot F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23227-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Under pathological conditions, cross-linking of proteins by phagocyte-derived myeloperoxidase has been proposed as a marker of oxidative stress in human atherosclerotic lesions (30Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke H.L. d. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to arteriosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis also has been characterized as a disease of oxidative stress (37Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Borish E.T. Pryor W.A. Ames B.N. Saul R.L. McCord J.M. Harman D. Ann. Intern. Med. 1987; 107: 526-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms by which oxidants might contribute to disease pathogenesis are not known (38Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Cross C.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 598-620PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest one possible, and even likely, mechanism. The strong association of TGF-β1 and myofibroblasts in lesion formation and the involvement of phagocytic cells in this process provide all of the necessary components for this reaction to occur in vivo. The recent data suggesting that the biomechanical properties of the ECM may regulate myofibroblast differentiation are intriguing (15Arora P.D. Narani N. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 16Narani N. Arora P.D. Lew A. Luo L. Glogauer M. Ganss B. McCulloch C.A. Curr. Top. Pathol. 1999; 93: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Oxidative cross-linking of ECM would be expected to reduce tissue compliance and further promote myofibroblast differentiation by this mechanism, suggesting a potential positive feedback loop. Alternatively, cross-linking of ECM proteins may render them less susceptible to digestion by matrix metalloproteinases (39Bailey A.J. Wound Repair Regen. 2000; 8: 5-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If such effects can be confirmed in vivo, it would present multiple potential targets for therapy of fibrotic diseases including carefully designed antioxidant strategies. The specific ECM protein(s) targeted by H2O2/HRP-dependent cross-linking reactions induced by TGF-β1 in our study are currently unknown. It is quite clear, however, that these proteins are localized primarily in the ECM based not only on the observed pattern of fluorescent labeling but also on the finding that the extracellular enzymes, HRP and catalase, which do not freely cross the plasma membrane, regulate/alter these reactions when added extracellularly. Candidate molecules for this reaction include collagen and elastin, both of which have been shown to undergo dityrosine-dependent cross-linking when H2O2 and HRP are introduced exogenously (40LaBella F. Keeley F. Vivian S. Thornhill D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 26: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,41LaBella F. Waykole P. Queen G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 30: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, both of these ECM proteins are well recognized to be up-regulated by TGF-β1 (42Lawrence R. Hartmann D.J. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9603-9609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Marigo V. Volpin D. Vitale G. Bressan G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The possibility that such reactions also may involve plasma membrane proteins at the cell surface requires further study. Whether oxidative cross-linking reactions of the type discussed may occur under physiologic rather than pathologic conditions is unclear. Physiologic cross-linking of collagen and elastin is mediated by lysyl oxidase, a copper amine oxidase that modifies the ε-amino group of lysine side chains in these ECM proteins to form inter- and intrachain cross-links (44Smith-Mungo L.I. Kagan H.M. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a “by-product” of this reaction is H2O2. However, no role for lysyl oxidase-generated H2O2 in protein cross-linking has been demonstrated. We have excluded the possibility that lysyl oxidase activity may be responsible for TGF-β1-induced H2O2 production. The lysyl oxidase inhibitors, β-aminopropionitrile and ethylenediamine, had no effect on TGF-β1-induced NADH oxidase activity/H2O2production (20Thannickal V.J. Day R.M. Klinz S.G. Bastien M.C. Larios J.M. Fanburg B.L. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1741-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have demonstrated that this enzyme activity involves a flavoprotein (14Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30334-30338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), which is not required for lysyl oxidase activity (45Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that the enzyme responsible for this effect of TGF-β1 in fibroblasts is related closely to the phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase family of plasma membrane oxidases. 2J. M. Larios and V.

Here we have studied the transcriptional activation of both promoters on chromatin templates. c-mycchromatin was reconstituted on stably transfected, episomal, Epstein-Barr virus-derived vectors in a B cell line. Episomal P1 and P2 promoters showed only basal activity but were strongly inducible by histone deacetylase inhibitors. The effect of promoter mutations on c-myc activity, chromatin structure, and E2F binding was studied. The ME1a1 binding site between P1 and P2 was required for the maintenance of an open chromatin configuration of the dual c-myc promoters. Mutation of this site strongly reduced the sensitivity of the core promoter region of P1/P2 to micrococcal nuclease and prevented binding of polymerase II (pol II) at the P2 promoter. In contrast, mutation of the P2 TATA box also abolished binding of pol II at the P2 promoter but did not affect the chromatin structure of the P1/P2 core promoter region. The E2F binding site adjacent to ME1a1 is required for repression of the P2 promoter but not the P1 promoter, likely by recruitment of histone deacetylase activity. Chromatin precipitation experiments with E2F-specific antibodies revealed binding of E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-4 to the E2F site of the c-myc promoter in vivo if the E2F site was intact. Taken together, the analyses support a model with a functional hierarchy for regulatory elements in the c-mycpromoter region; binding of proteins to the ME1a1 site provides a nucleosome-free region of chromatin near the P2 start site, binding of E2F results in transcriptional repression without affecting polymerase recruitment, and the TATA box is required for polymerase recruitment.

At physiological concentration apoE promotes efficient clearance of apoE-containing lipoprotein remnants. However, high apoE plasma levels correlate with high plasma triglyceride levels. We have used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in apoE-deficient mice (E−/−) to define the domains of apoE required for cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis in vivo. A dose of 2 × 109 plaque-forming units of apoE4-expressing adenovirus reduced slightly the cholesterol levels of E−/− mice and resulted in severe hypertriglyceridemia, due to accumulation of cholesterol and triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein particles in plasma. In contrast, the truncated form apoE4–202 resulted in a 90% reduction in the plasma cholesterol levels but did not alter plasma triglyceride levels in the E−/− mice. ApoE secretion by cell cultures, as well as the steady-state hepatic mRNA levels in individual mice expressing apoE4 or apoE4–202, were similar. In contrast, very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride secretion in mice expressing apoE4, but not apoE4–202, was increased 10-fold, as compared with mice infected with a control adenovirus. The findings suggest that the amino-terminal 1–202 region of apoE4 contains the domains required for the in vivo clearance of lipoprotein remnants. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal 203–299 residues of apoE promote hepatic very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride secretion and contribute to apoE-induced hypertriglyceridemia.

In contrast, very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride secretion in mice expressing apoE4, but not apoE4–202, was increased 10-fold, as compared with mice infected with a control adenovirus. The findings suggest that the amino-terminal 1–202 region of apoE4 contains the domains required for the in vivo clearance of lipoprotein remnants. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal 203–299 residues of apoE promote hepatic very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride secretion and contribute to apoE-induced hypertriglyceridemia. apolipoprotein adenovirus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay fast pressure liquid chromatography glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase green fluorescence protein high density lipoprotein polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis very low density lipoprotein plaque-forming units phosphate-buffered saline low density lipoprotein LDL receptor IDL, intermediate density lipoproteins base pair wild type Apolipoprotein (apo)1 E is the ligand for several cell receptors and promotes the catabolism of apoE-containing lipoprotein remnants by the liver (1Innerarity T.L.

In contrast, lack of apoE is associated with decreased VLDL-triglyceride secretion (40Kulpers F. Jong M.C. Lin Y. van Eck M. Havinga R. Bloke V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Such studies provide compelling evidence that apoE contributes both to cholesterol as well as triglyceride homeostasis in vivo.To identify the domains of apoE that contribute to cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis in vivo, we used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in apoE-deficient mice. We have found that overexpression of full-length apoE4 is associated with high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, whereas overexpression of apoE4–202 normalizes the cholesterol levels of apoE-deficient mice and does not trigger hypertriglyceridemia. ApoE secretion by cells, hepatic apoE mRNA expression, and association of apoE with VLDL are not affected by the apoE truncation. In contrast, apoE4, but not apoE4–202, greatly increases hepatic VLDL-triglyceride secretion. Our findings suggest that truncated forms of apoE may find useful gene therapy applications in the future in correcting remnant removal disorders.DISCUSSIONApoE promotes receptor-mediated catabolism of apoE-containing lipoproteins by cell receptors (1Innerarity T.L.

The receptor binding domain is found between residues 136 and 152, whereas neighboring residues may also indirectly affect receptor binding (48Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Harde K.J. Mahley R.W.

Two other heparin binding domains were found between residues 211 and 218 and 243 and 272 (57Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that binding of apoE-containing lipoproteins to heparan sulfate proteoglycans contributes to their subsequent internalization with or without the participation of LRP (2Herz J. Willnow T.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Mahley R.W. Huang Y. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 55Ji S.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 289: 2772-2784Google Scholar). Other studies suggested that the region of apoE between residues 244 and 299 contributes to the binding of apoE to lipids and lipoproteins, whereas the amino-terminal region of apoE lacks the determinants required for association with lipoproteins (60Westerlund J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 15745-15750Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In addition, residues 267–299 were found to be important for the tetramerization of apoE (60Westerlund J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 15745-15750Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).The present study refines the domains of apoE required for its association with lipoproteins, a process required for their in vivo clearance. Our findings establish that the amino-terminal residues 1–202 of apoE contain the domains necessary for the clearance of cholesteryl ester-rich lipoprotein remnants in vivo. This implies that the region 1–202 of apoE contains the necessary determinants for the association of apoE with these lipoprotein remnants in vitro. This conclusion is supported by in vitro data in the present study, showing that apoE4 and apoE4–202 remain associated with VLDL and LDL particles following ultracentrifugation. The clearance of lipoprotein remnants by apoE4–202, which contains only the 142–147 heparin binding domains, is extremely efficient. Previous studies showed that the 243–272 heparin binding domain of apoE is shielded when apoE is bound to lipids and lipoproteins and thus is inactive as a ligand for heparan sulfate proteoglycans (57Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 281: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It is possible that the major route of clearance of the lipoproteins containing apoE4–202, which contains only the 142–147 heparin binding domain, is via the LDL receptor and LRP pathways without the involvement of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan pathway. The potential participation of the LRP and the LDL receptor in the clearance of apoE4–202-containing remnants may make their uptake and the subsequent cholesterol clearance more efficient and thus may account for the observed efficiency of apoE4–202 in cholesterol clearance. This hypothesis is currently under investigation.The Carboxyl-terminal Domain of ApoE Contributes to HypertriglyceridemiaA very important finding of this study is that removal of the carboxyl-terminal region 203–299 of apoE4 prevents the development of hypertriglyceridemia following adenoviral infection. Several control experiments were performed to confirm that the different properties of apoE4 and apoE4–202 are not the result of differences in expression, secretion, or association with VLDL. Northern blot analysis of total RNA has established unequivocally that the steady-state apoE mRNA levels in mice overexpressing apoE4 that result in hypertriglyceridemia and the mRNA levels in mice overexpressing apoE4–202 that do not cause hypertriglyceridemia are very similar (Fig. 3, A–D). This analysis indicates that it is unlikely that decreased expression of the truncated apoE forms is responsible for this effect. In addition, cell culture experiments showed that C127 (mouse mammary tumor) cell lines stably transfected and expressing apoE4 or apoE4–202 (data not shown), or HTB-13 cell cultures infected with recombinant adenovirus, secrete similar amounts of apoE4 and apoE4–202. These observations indicate that the truncated apoE4–202 form is stable and is secreted as efficiently as its wild-type apoE4 counterpart.Mechanisms of ApoE-induced HypertriglyceridemiaAside from differences in synthesis, secretion, and VLDL association between apoE4 and apoE4–202, other factors that could have contributed to the apoE-induced hypertriglyceridemia are increased hepatic VLDL-triglyceride synthesis, decreased catabolism of apoE4 as compared with apoE4–202-containing particles, and a combination of both processes.Increased Hepatic VLDL-Triglyceride Secretion Promoted by the Carboxyl-terminal 203–99 Residues of ApoE4The present study shows that the hepatic VLDL-triglyceride secretion, following injection of Triton WR1339, decreases by 50% in mice expressing apoE4–202 and increases 10-fold in mice expressing apoE4, as compared with the mice infected with the control virus AdGFP (Fig. 6). This implies that apoE4 contributes to hypertriglyceridemia, at least partially, by increasing VLDL-triglyceride secretion. The hypertriglyceridemic VLDL may be a poor ligand for apoE-recognizing receptors, despite the fact that it is enriched with apoE. A previous study also showed that VLDL-triglyceride secretion is reduced by 50% in E−/−mice (40Kulpers F. Jong M.C. Lin Y. van Eck M. Havinga R. Bloke V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The findings imply that the carboxyl-termina"

We used electrical stimulation (5 Hz, 65 V) of C2C12 muscle cells in culture to define some of the mechanisms involved in contractile activity-induced changes in cytochromec gene expression. Chronic contractile activity (4 days, 3 h/day) augmented cytochrome c mRNA by 1.6-fold above control cells. This was likely mediated by increases in transcriptional activation, because cells transfected with full-length (−726 base pairs) or minimal (−66 base pairs) cytochrome cpromoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs demonstrated contractile activity-induced 1.5–1.7-fold increases in the absence of contractile activity-induced increases in mRNA stability. Transcriptional activation of the −726 promoter was abolished when muscle contraction was inhibited at various subcellular locations by pretreatment with either the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin, the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester, or the myosin ATPase inhibitor 2,3-butanedione monoxime. It was further reduced in unstimulated cells when mitochondrial ATP synthesis was impaired using the uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol. Because the contractile activity-induced response was evident within the minimal promoter, electromobility shift assays performed within the first intron (+75 to +104 base pairs) containing Sp1 sites revealed an elevated DNA binding in response to contractile activity. This was paralleled by increases in Sp1 protein levels. Sp1 overexpression studies also led to increases in cytochromec transactivation and mRNA levels. These data suggest that variations in the rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis are important in determining cytochrome c gene expression in muscle cells and that this is mediated, in part, by Sp1-induced increases in cytochrome c transcription.

These increases result from a disruption in the equilibrium that exists between gene transcription and mRNA stability during nonadaptive steady-state conditions. Elevations in the level of the mRNA encoding the nuclear gene product cytochrome c in response to in vivo contractile activity have been reported (5Yan Z. Salmons S. Dang Y.L. Hamilton M.T. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1157-C1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our recent work has established that this adaptation is mediated via sequential, time-dependent elevations in both of these processes (6Freyssenet D. Connor M.K. Takahashi M. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E26-E32PubMed Google Scholar). This necessitates alterations in the expression of proteins involved in regulating transcriptional activation and/or message stabilization within the cytosol. However, the specific cellular events that occur during muscle contraction to initiate these adaptations remain largely undefined. These events could include membrane depolarization, Ca2+ mobilization, cross-bridge cycling, and alterations in energy metabolism. Each of these are known to initiate intracellular signaling cascades (7Schmidt J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 127: 251-279Crossref Google Scholar, 8Freyssenet D. Di Carlo M. Hood D.A. J.

It is now established that acute elevations in contractile activity can stimulate a number of kinases involved in signal transduction, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 kinase activities in skeletal muscle (4Hood D.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 1137-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 12Aronson D. Dufresne S.D. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 271: E403-E408PubMed Google Scholar). However, the temporal relationship between the onset of the putative signaling event (i.e. kinase activity), transcription factor activation, and the up-regulation of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins in response to contractile activity remains unknown. We have previously used cytochrome c as a model, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein to define some of the adaptations that occur in response to contractile activity and artificially elevated muscle Ca2+ levels (6Freyssenet D. Connor M.K. Takahashi M. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E26-E32PubMed Google Scholar, 8Freyssenet D. Di Carlo M. Hood D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9305-9311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cytochromec promoter contains multiple GC-rich regions that can serve as binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 (14Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11109-11110Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15Phillipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 16Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14361-14368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the zinc finger transcription factor Egr-1 (17Christy B.A. Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7857-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) may also interact with these elements, because the consensus binding sequences are similar, and it may be that Sp1 and Egr-1 can compete for similar, nonconsensus sites (14Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11109-11110Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sp1-mediated gene transcription is inhibited by Egr-1 displacement of Sp1 from the promoter (18Huang R.-P. Fan Y. Ni Z. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Silverman E.S. Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1415-H1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Egr-1 is rapidly induced in response to elevations in contractile activity (20Michel J.B. Ordway G.A. Richardson J.A. Williams R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Abu-Shakra S.R. Cole A.J. Drachman D.B. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as well as elevated intracellular Ca2+levels (22Abu-Shakra S.R. Cole A.J. Adams R.N. Drachman D.B. Mol. Brain. Res. 1994; 26: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These findings suggest potential roles for both Sp1 and Egr-1 in the regulation of cytochrome c expression during conditions of increased contractile activity. Thus, in the present study we adopted a contracting C2C12 murine skeletal muscle cell model to define some of the events occurring during muscle contraction that initiate the increase in cytochrome c expression and to identify some of the transcription factors that are immediately responsible for this increase. BDM,1TTX, DNP, and ACT were purchased from Sigma. [14C]Chloramphenicol, [α-32P]dCTP, [γ-32P]ATP, nitrocellulose, and nylon membranes (Hybond N) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. BAPTA-AM was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Fetal bovine serum and horse serum were obtained from Summit Biotechnologies (Fort Collins, CO) and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. Polyclonal antibodies directed toward Egr-1, Sp1, and Cyclin D1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The dual luciferase reporter assay system was from Promega (Madison, WI). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. The oligodeoxynucleotides used for electromobility shift assays were 1) Sp1, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ (Dalton Chemicals, Toronto); 2) Egr-1, 5′-GGATCCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGA-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz); and 3) a sequence composed of +75 to +104 of the first intron of the cytochrome c gene, 5′-GGGGACGCGGGGCGGGAAGAGGGCGAGGAG-3′ (Dalton Chemicals, Toronto, Canada). C2C12 murine skeletal muscle cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 on 100-mm gelatin-coated plastic dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Upon reaching 90% confluence, myoblast differentiation was induced by switching to a lower serum medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). Treatments were routinely carried out when the myotubes occupied 90–100% of the dish (∼8–10 days). The design of the electrical stimulation apparatus was derived by modifying existing methods (23Brevet A. Pinto E. Peacock J. Stockdale F.E. Science. 1976; 193: 1152-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol.

Lids from plastic 100-mm culture dishes (Sarstedt, Montreal, Canada) were fitted with two platinum wire electrodes such that 5-cm lengths ran parallel to each other at opposite ends of the dish ∼5 cm apart. Electrodes were attached to the plates using miniature banana plugs (Electrosonic, Toronto, Canada). Multiple plates were arranged in parallel and connected to a stimulator unit, which reversed the polarity of the output every second. Cells were stimulated at a frequency of 5 Hz and an intensity of 65 V (1.2 V/cm2). Stimulation was either performed acutely for 5, 15, 30, 60, or 240 min or chronically for 4 days (3 h/day). Cell extracts obtained from the chronic experiments were prepared 21 h after the last stimulation period. To determine the event(s) of muscle contraction responsible for activity-induced alterations in gene expression, sarcomere shortening was inhibited at three different levels 24 h prior to the onset of stimulation: 1) membrane depolarization was inhibited by preventing the opening of voltage-gated Na+ channels by treatment with 10 μm TTX, 2) contraction was disrupted by pretreatment with the membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (25 μm); this was done to prevent the increase in cytosolic [Ca2+], which occurs subsequent to membrane depolarization; and 3) contraction was inhibited by preventing cross-bridge cycling while allowing membrane depolarization and Ca2+ fluxes to occur by treatment with 1.5 mmBDM. This concentration of BDM has been shown to have no effect on Ca2+ transients in phenylepherine treated cardiac myocytes (26Byron K.L. Puglisi J.L. Holda J.R. Eble D. Samarel A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1447-C1456Crossref Google Scholar) and appears to act by inhibiting myosin ATPase activity (27Sellin L.C. McArdle J.J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 74: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were electrically stimulated for 4 days during each treatment (3 h/day), and results from drug-treated cells were compared with quiescent cells treated with the corresponding vehicle (VEH). Finally, mitochondrial ATP synthesis was inhibited by treatment of unstimulated cells with 200 μm DNP to uncouple mitochondrial respiration. In this case, cells were treated for 9 h on two consecutive days. Cells were harvested immediately after treatment on the second day. Total RNA was isolated from stimulated and unstimulated control cells as done previously (6Freyssenet D. Connor M.K. Takahashi M. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E26-E32PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O. Determination of the quality and subsequent size separation of total RNA (15 μg for cytochrome c or 30 μg for Egr-1) was achieved by electrophoresis using denaturing formaldehyde-1% agarose gels, which were transferred and subsequently fixed to nylon membranes. These membranes were then probed with radiolabeled cDNA probes encoding cytochrome c, Egr-1, and 18 S rRNA as done previously (28Connor M.K. Takahashi M. Hood D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Stringent washes were performed at 55 °C for 15 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS followed by 15 min at 60 °C. Signals were quantified by electronic autoradiography (Instantimager, Packard), and cytochrome c and Egr-1 mRNAs were normalized to 18 S rRNA levels to correct for uneven loading. Plasmid constructs containing various lengths of the cytochrome c promoters linked to a reporter gene (pRC4CAT and pRC4LUC) were provided by Dr. R. Scarpulla (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) and Dr. F. Booth (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO), respectively, and have been previously characterized (16Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14361-14368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The pRC4CAT/−726 construct is composed of sequences from the cytochrome c promoter from −726 bp upstream of the transcription start site to position +115 within the first intron, fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Experiments utilizing the minimal cytochrome c promoter (pRC4CAT/−66 or pRC4LUC/−66) were also conducted, because this region has been shown to be sufficient to confer cytochrome ctranscriptional activation in response to elevated levels of intracellular Ca2+ (8Freyssenet D. Di Carlo M. Hood D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9305-9311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild type Sp1 driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter was achieved with a vector provided by Dr. G. Suske (University of Marburg, Germany). β-Galactosidase activity, under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter or Renilla luciferase activity driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter was used to correct for transfection efficiency. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with the appropriate cytochrome cpromoter/reporter construct (5 μg/100-mm dish) along with pRSV/β-gal (5 μg/dish) or pCMV/RL (5 ng/dish) when they reached 70% confluence. Where applicable, wild type Sp1 or empty vector were also cotransfected (5 μg/dish) in combination with cytochromec promoter/reporter constructs. The total amount of DNA added was maintained constant in all transfected cells. Transfections were done using a poly-l-ornithine method followed by a Me2SO shock (30Robey R.B. Osawa H. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 40-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells were then differentiated by switching to a low serum medium. CAT and β-galactosidase activities in stimulated and quiescent cells were measured as described previously (8Freyssenet D. Di Carlo M. Hood D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9305-9311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were measured in a EG & G Berthold (Lumat LB 9507) luminometer using the dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Differentiated myotubes were either electrically stimulated for 4 days (3 h/day) or left untreated for a similar time period. Immediately after the final bout of stimulation, cells (stimulated and control) were treated with either 10 μg/ml ACT to inhibit mRNA synthesis or an equivalent volume of methanol, which served as the VEH. Myocytes were incubated with ACT or VEH for 4, 24, or 48 h. At the appropriate time points, cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated. Equal amounts of total RNA (15 μg) from ACT- and VEH-treated cells were subjected to Northern blotting as described above. Blots were probed for cytochrome c mRNA and uneven loading was corrected using 18 S rRNA. Cytochrome c mRNA degradation was assessed by expressing the mRNA levels found at all time points as a percentage of the t = 0 value. Nuclear proteins were isolated from stimulated and control cells by scraping them from culture dishes in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by centrifugation for 10 s in a microcentrifuge (4 °C). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of swelling buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following a 10-min incubation on ice, cells were vortexed and pelleted in a microcentrifuge (4 °C). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of resuspension buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following a 20-min incubation on ice, cells were pelleted for 2 min in a microcentrifuge (4 °C). The supernatant was removed and used in electromobility shift assays following determination of protein content using a Bradford assay (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These nuclear extracts (25 μg) were incubated with 20 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 50 μmpyrophosphate, and 40,000 cpm of a [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled oligonucleotide (containing the sequence between +75 and +104 bp of the cytochrome c gene) in a binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 m MgCl2, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA) at room temperature for 20 min. To determine the specificity of binding, competition assays were conducted by preincubating extracts (20 min) with a 100 molar excess of cold oligonucleotide before the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotides used in these competition assays were composed of 1) +75 to +104 bp of the first intron of the cytochrome c gene, 2) the consensus Sp1 binding site, and 3) the consensus Egr-1 binding site. Samples were run on a nondenaturing 4% acrylamide gel and were electrophoresed for 3 h (200 V). The gel was subsequently fixed for 15 min in acetic acid/methanol/H2O (10:30:60), dried, and imaged utilizing an Instantimager (Packard). C2C12 muscle cells were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently scraped from culture dishes in 200 μl of Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Equal amounts of nuclear extracts (50 μg) were size-separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with polyclonal antibodies for Egr-1, Sp1, or cyclin D1 (1:500). Blots were then probed with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cytochromec oxidase activity was measured as described previously (2Hood D.A. Zak R. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The data presented are the means ± S.E. Student's t test was used to evaluate the effects of contractile activity, Sp1 overexpression, or DNP treatment on mRNA levels and transcriptional activation. One-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effects of TTX, BAPTA-AM, and BDM on cytochrome c transcriptional activation in stimulated and unstimulated control cells. In all cases individual differences were determined using Tukey's post-hoc test and differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Using our cell culture model, myotubes were observed to contract synchronously at the correct frequency (5 Hz) using voltages as low as 35 V. Cells appeared to reach maximal shortening at 55 V with no further increase in contraction intensity apparent at voltages as high as 110 V. Thus, cells in subsequent experiments were stimulated at an intensity of 65 V (1.2 V/cm2). This voltage is much lower than that previously used to stimulate cardiac myocytes in culture (32Xia Y. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12593-12598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Xia Y. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. J. Biol.

Connor and D. A. Hood, unpublished observations. To more objectively assess the effectiveness of the treatment, we evaluated the acute effects of stimulation on Egr-1 mRNA levels, because Egr-1 mRNA is known to increase rapidly with contractile activity (20Michel J.B. Ordway G.A. Richardson J.A. Williams R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Abu-Shakra S.R. Cole A.J. Drachman D.B. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Increases (p < 0.05) in mRNA were evident as early as 15 min after the onset of stimulation (Fig.1). This increase was transient in nature, reaching a maximum of 4.0-fold above that in unstimulated control cells following 30 min of contractile activity and declining to 2.0-fold above control after 4 h of stimulation. This effect is similar to that observed previously in vivo (20Michel J.B. Ordway G.A. Richardson J.A. Williams R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and it demonstrates the effectiveness of the myocyte electrical stimulation model in rapidly altering muscle gene expression. Cytochrome c was chosen as a representative model of the effect of contractile activity on the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Four days of electrical stimulation (3 h/day) resulted in an elevation in cytochrome c mRNA to levels that were 1.6-fold above those in unstimulated cells (Fig.2 A, p < 0.05). This adaptation occurred prior to changes in mitochondrial enzymes reflected by cytochrome c oxidase activity, which was 157.3 ± 20.1 and 150.0 ± 2.7 nmol/min/mg (n = 3) in control and stimulated cells, respectively. To assess whether electrical stimulation affects cytochromec transcription, myocytes were transfected with pRC4CAT/−726 plasmid constructs, which contained the full-length cytochrome c promoter linked to a CAT reporter gene. CAT assays revealed a 1.5-fold higher (p < 0.05) cytochrome c transcriptional activation in stimulated cells compared with unstimulated control cells (Fig. 2 B), which paralleled the stimulation-induced increase in cytochrome cmRNA. Because it has been shown previously that the factors involved in Ca2+-mediated increases in transcription act within the minimal −66 bp cytochrome c promoter (8Freyssenet D. Di Carlo M. Hood D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9305-9311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we transfected cells with plasmid constructs containing this region (pRC4CAT/−66). Electrical stimulation of these cells elicited similar increases (1.7-fold higher; p < 0.05) in CAT activity as with the −726 construct, compared with unstimulated control cells (Fig. 2 B). This observation indicates the presence of a contractile activity response element within this minimal −66-bp promoter region. To evaluate the possible contribution of contractile activity-induced changes in mRNA stability to the increase in cytochromec mRNA observed, we measured cytochrome cmRNA decay in stimulated and unstimulated cells. Similar degradation rates of cytochrome c mRNA were observed in stimulated and control cells, which declined by 23.8 ± 4.5 and 30.1 ± 9.7%, respectively, after 48 h of transcriptional inhibition with ACT (Fig. 2 C). Cytochrome cmRNAs were very stable in these cells, exhibiting an extrapolated half-life of ∼89 h. These data suggest that the contractile activity-induced increase in cytochrome c mRNA was due to increases in gene transcription. Following 4 days of electrical stimulation (3 h/day), there was a contractile activity-induced 2.4 ± 0.5-fold increase in Sp1 protein levels, whereas no effect of electrical stimulation on Egr-1 protein levels was evident (Fig.3 A). Coincident with this increase in Sp1 protein levels was a 1.8 ± 0.2-fold increase in DNA binding within the first intron (+75 to +104 bp) of the cytochromec promoter (Fig. 3 B, lane 2 versus lane 3). This binding was prevented by incubation with 100-molar excess of a cold oligodeoxynucleotide containing a portion of the first intron of the cytochrome c gene (lane 4). In addition, DNA binding was eliminated by preincubation with a nonradiolabeled consensus Sp1 deoxyribonucleotide (lane 5), suggesting that Sp1 may be responsible for the activity-induced activation of cytochrome c transcription. In contrast, there was no significant effect of preincubation with a cold oligonucleotide containing the consensus Egr-1 binding sequence (lane 6). To further evaluate the effects of contractile activity on Sp1 activation, extracts from stimulated and control cells were incubated with a radiolabeled consensus Sp1 sequence (Fig.3 C, lanes 1–4). These analyses revealed a stimulation-induced elevation in Sp1 DNA binding (lane 2 versus lane 3), which was completely eliminated by the addition of an excess of cold Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (lane 4). In contrast, there was no effect of contractile activity on binding to an Egr-1 consensus oligonucleotide (lane 6 versus lane 7). As expected, Egr-1 binding was not evident in the presence of an excess of cold Egr-1 consensus oligonucleotides (lane 8). Taken together, these results suggest that electrical stimulation increases Sp1 binding within the first intron of the cytochrome c gene and that Egr-1 does not bind within this region. To further evaluate the role of Sp1 in cytochrome c transcriptional activation, cells were cotransfected with either empty vector or a vector directing the overexpression of Sp1, along with the pRC4LUC/−66 construct. Luciferase activity controlled by this minimal promoter was ∼3-fold higher in Sp1 overexpressing cells (Fig.4 A; p < 0.05). This was accompanied by a modest but significant 25% increase in cytochrome c mRNA levels (Fig. 4 B;p < 0.05). To evaluate the event(s) occurring during contractile activity that provide the putative signal responsible for activity-induced cytochrome ctransactivation, muscle contraction was inhibited at various subcellular levels. First, cells were transfected with the −726-bp cytochrome c promoter and were treated 24 h prior to the onset of stimulation with 1) TTX (10 μm) to prevent membrane depolarization, 2) BAPTA-AM (25 μm) to prevent the increase in [Ca2+]i associated with Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, or 3) BDM (1.5 mm) to prevent cross-bridge cycling.

Appendicularia, or larvaceans, are pelagic tunicates (Urochordata) that feed on dissolved organic carbon and microorganisms by filtering seawater through a transparent mucous structure called the house. The name ““”larvaceans“”” derives from the fact that the adult animal resembles the larval form more closely than in the other two classes of Urochordata. In the latter two classes, metamorphosis drastically redesigns the body plan, whereas in appendicularia, it consists of a simple switch in tail position (tailshift) from a straight posteriorly directed orientation to a definitive arrangement, where the tail is orthogonal to the trunk and retains the notochord as its axial structure. For this reason, appendicularia are thought to have diverged earlier from the chordate ancestor than their sister classes, and recent phylogenetic analyses of 28 and 18 S rRNA genes confirm this view (1Wada H. Satoh N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 2Christen R. Braconnot J.-C. Bone Q. The Biology of Pelagic Tunicates. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 265-271Google Scholar). Appendicularia have three features common to all chordates at some stage in the life cycle: gill slits, a tubular nerve chord, and a rod-shaped notochord. The appendicularia and vertebrates form a robust monophyletic unit, with two Oikopleura species forming a sister group to all vertebrates (2Christen R. Braconnot J.-C. Bone Q. The Biology of Pelagic Tunicates. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 265-271Google Scholar). The term appendicularia refers to the appendices of the animal, namely their houses. Appendicularian houses are sophisticated filtration devices with a very complex architecture, featuring different compartments, valves, septa, and two sets of filters (3Alldredge A. J. Zool. 1977; 181: 175-188Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Flood P. Mar. Biol. ( N.Y. ). 1991; 111: 95-111Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Flood P. Deibel D. Bone Q. The Biology of Pelagic Tunicates. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 105-124Google Scholar). The house is secreted as a rudiment by the oikoplastic epithelium, a specialized single-layered organ that covers the trunk of the animal (see Fig. 1). The house rudiment is expanded by means of specific movements of the tail, which is eventually withdrawn inside the house, such that the entire animal is contained within this structure. Sinusoidal movements of the tail control the flow of water through the house filters. The cells of the oikoplastic epithelium stop dividing before secretion of the first house. Their number is fixed for a given species of the genusOikopleura, being about 2,000 in Oikopleura dioica (6Lohmann H. Schr. Naturwiss. Ver. Schleswig-Holstein. 1899; 11: 347-407Google Scholar, 7Martini E. Z. Wiss. Zool. 1909; 94: 563-626Google Scholar, 8Lohmann H. Bückmann A. Deutsche Südpolar-Expedition 1901–1903. 18 (Zoologie 10). Polarphilazelie e.V., Leverkusen, Germany1926: 63-221Google Scholar). Frequent replacement of the house is needed to maintain sufficient filtration rates (9Fenaux R. Bull. Mar. Sci. 1985; 37: 498-503Google Scholar), and the cells of the oikoplastic epithelium sustain high rates of house protein synthesis and secretion from shortly before filter feeding begins until the end of the life cycle. For O. dioica, a new house is synthesized every 3–4 h over a life cycle of 5–6 days at 15 °C. During the life cycle, which is extremely short for a complex metazoan, the animal grows about 10-fold in size, and there is a concomitant increase in the size of the oikoplastic cells. Cell growth is paralleled by an increase in the sizes of the nuclei and in their DNA content (10Fenaux R. Z. Morphol. Tiere. 1971; 69: 184-200Google Scholar). It is not known whether the increase of DNA content represents partial or total amplification of the genome. During this process, however, the shape and size of the terminally differentiated cells of the oikoplastic epithelium becomes highly variable. These vary from round and relatively small to lobate, oblong shapes attaining a large size. The complexity of the house structure is mirrored by the diverse patterns of the oikoplastic cells. Thus far, different fields of cells have been identified within the epithelium on the basis of nuclear morphology, size, and pattern formation (6Lohmann H. Schr. Naturwiss. Ver. Schleswig-Holstein. 1899; 11: 347-407Google Scholar, 7Martini E. Z. Wiss. Zool. 1909; 94: 563-626Google Scholar, 8Lohmann H. Bückmann A. Deutsche Südpolar-Expedition 1901–1903. 18 (Zoologie 10).

W. de Gruyter, Berlin1933: 15-164Google Scholar). A correlation between these morphologically identified fields of cells and the production of specific structures of the house seems apparent for the two sets of filters, the inlet filter being secreted by the field of Eisen and the food concentrating filters being secreted by the field of Fol (see Fig. 1). These functional correlations remain crude when compared with the complexity of the filters and the patterns of cells held responsible for their secretion. The structural characteristics of different parts of houses of the genus Oikopleura have been studied by electron microscopy (4Flood P. Mar. Biol. ( N.Y. ). 1991; 111: 95-111Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but very little information, based primarily on histochemical staining, is available concerning their biochemical composition and properties (5Flood P. Deibel D. Bone Q. The Biology of Pelagic Tunicates. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 105-124Google Scholar). Thus, O. dioica has a monolayer of accessible epithelium, with low and constant cell number, that serves as a template for the synthesis of diverse house structures from clearly defined regions of cells with distinct nuclear morphologies. This is an attractive model system for investigating: (i) coordinate regulation of gene expression, (ii) cell-cell interactions involved in pattern formation, (iii) gene/genome amplification, and (iv) the role of nuclear architecture in regulating gene expression. However, for the oikoplastic epithelium ofOikopleura to become a bona fide model for studying the questions posed above, it remains to be established that the structures in the house are synthesized from a diverse array of gene products with expression patterns restricted to different regions of cells. Alternatively, relatively few genes could be involved, with their products undergoing differential post-translational modifications. In the present study we report partial biochemical characterization of the house polypeptides of O. dioica and the cloning of cDNAs encoding four of them. We demonstrate that the genes coding for these cDNAs are expressed in well defined complementary regions of the oikoplastic epithelium. One of the cDNAs codes for a very large polypeptide, showing distant homology to vertebrate gel-forming mucins and human cartilage intermediate layer protein, and the corresponding gene is expressed only in the 14 giant cells of the Fol region. Animals were collected from fjords around Bergen, Norway and were cultured in 6-liter beakers with constant stirring at 14–15 °C. The duration of the life cycle was 5–6 days. Mature males and females were placed together in 4-liter volumes of seawater and allowed to spawn. Metamorphosis took place 12–14 h after spawning, at which time the animals expanded their first house and began filter feeding. The animals then grew continuously and on day 5 the gonads increased dramatically in size, surpassing the size of the trunk of the animal at spawning. Cultures were diluted 1:6 on day 1 and 1:1 on day 2, and then animals were transferred to clean sea water by pipetting on each of the following days. The appendicularia were maintained on cultured algal strains of Isochrysis galbana, Chaetoceros calcitrans, andSynecococcus sp., supplemented with Rhodomonassp. and/or Tetraselmis sp. from day 3 onward. To collect house rudiments free from contaminating particles and microorganisms, adult animals (day 4–5) were forced out of their houses and transferred to filtered seawater. House rudiments were then removed as soon as the animals started expanding them. Aliquots of 50–200 house rudiments were stored at −80 °C. After thawing, aliquots were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove excess sea water. Rudiments were then fragmented by making a few holes with a 27-gauge needle in the bottom of the tube and centrifuging this into a second collecting tube. House rudiments were then heated at 100 °C for 5 min in 1“%” SDS. The denatured rudiments were diluted 5-fold with 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 12.5 mm EDTA, 0.625“%” CHAPS,1 and 1.25“%” “β”-mercaptoethanol and heated again at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, protease inhibitors (a leupeptin, pepstatin, E-64, bestatin, (4-[2-aminoethyl]benzenesulfonylfluoride, and aprotinin mixture from Sigma diluted 1:100) were added, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was recovered. Glycosidases were added to a supernatant obtained from 50 house rudiments as follows: 0.2 unit of peptide-N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 5–20 milliunits (as indicated) of α2–3,6,8-neuraminidase (Calbiochem), and 2 milliunits of bovine serum albumin-freeO-glycosidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). When larger aliquots were processed, enzyme amounts were scaled up proportionally. Incubation was at 37 °C for at least 18 h. Undigested samples were incubated under the same conditions. For one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) samples were loaded directly, or in the case of large solubilization volumes, precipitated with 20“%” trichloroacetic acid, and then redissolved in loading buffer. Gel and buffer compositions were according to Shägger and von Jagow (12Shägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10501) Google Scholar), except that 16-cm-long gels with a 5–16“%” polyacrylamide gradient (3“%” crosslinking) were used to maximize resolution over a wide molecular mass range. Gels were stained with minor modifications of the combined alcian blue-periodic acid oxidation-silver staining procedure of Møller and Poulsen (13Møller H. Poulsen J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or by neutral silver staining (14Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7830) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed with isoelectrofocusing on immobilized pH gradients as the first dimension and SDS-PAGE as the second dimension. Deglycosylated samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as above and resuspended in 0.5“%” immobilized pH gradient buffer, pH 3–10 (APBiotech), 2“%” CHAPS, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 5 mm tributyl-phosphine, and 0.005“%” bromphenol blue. Dry immobilized pH gradients gel strips pH 3–10 NL (nonlinear pH gradient; 7 cm long; APBiotech) were rehydrated with resuspended samples overnight, and first dimension electrophoresis was performed with a Multiphor II apparatus (APBiotech). Electrofocused gel strips were then equilibrated in second dimension loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 2“%” SDS, 30“%” glycerol, 0.05“%” bromphenol blue) and applied on a vertical second dimension gel with a 5–16“%” polyacrylamide gradient as described for one-dimensional electrophoresis, except that the resolving gel was 11 cm long and no stacking gel was used. Two-dimensional gels were stained with the same neutral silver staining procedure as described for one-dimensional gels. Spots (two-dimensional) and bands (one-dimensional) corresponding to the added glycosidases were identified by comparison with gels run with enzyme blanks under identical conditions. Protein bands were excised from silver-stained one-dimensional polyacrylamide gels and processed as described (14Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7830) Google Scholar). After reduction and alkylation, overnight in-gel digestion was carried out at 37 °C with an excess of sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After digestion, the supernatant was acidified with formic acid, loaded onto a Poros R2 (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) micro-column, and desalted (15Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). The peptides were then eluted with 60“%” methanol, 5“%” formic acid directly into a nanoelectrospray needle (MDS Protana, Odense, Denmark). Peptides were sequenced by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry performed on a prototype quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (AB/MDS Sciex, Toronto, Canada) (16Shevchenko A. Chernuschevich I. Ens W. Standing K. Thomson B. Wilm M. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (MDS Protana). Total RNA from day 5 animals was extracted with the TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the poly(A)+ fraction was isolated from ∼200 “μ”g of total RNA by two rounds of oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography with the Poly(A)+ Quik mRNA isolation kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). This poly(A)+ RNA was the template for cDNA synthesis using the ZAP Express cDNA synthesis kit, and the cDNA was cloned and packaged using the ZAP Express cDNA Gigapack III Gold Cloning Kit (Stratagene) except that cDNA size selection was performed with SizeSep 400 Spun Columns (APBiotech). A primary library of 3 × 105 plaque-forming units was obtained and amplified once. A plating of 3 × 105plaque-forming units of the amplified library was screened with degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the peptide sequences shown in bold type in Fig. 3. The oligonucleotides were synthesized at Interactiva Biotechnologie (GmbH): G2, 5′-TGGTAYGGIGAYGAYCARGG-3′; G10, 5′-CAYTTYCCITGGTAYAAYAA-3′; H5, 5′-GAYACIGCITAYCAYGGITT-3′; I1, 5′-GARTTYTGYGGIGTIGAYTT-3′; and N6, 5′-TAYGAYAAYGAYCARGCIGC-3′, where Y = C or T, R = G or A, and I = inosine. Oligonucleotide nomenclature is based on the labeling of the protein bands from which they were derived. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynuclotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and pooled in hybridization buffer in relative concentrations such that each possible sequence of any of the degenerate sequences was present at a concentration of 31,25 pm. Filters were prehybridized in 6× SSC, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5“%” SDS, and 100 “μ”g/ml sheared herring sperm DNA and hybridized in 6× SSC, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.5“%” SDS, and 100 “μ”g/ml yeast tRNA at 37 °C for 48 h. Washing was at 37 °C in 6× SSC. Polymerase chain reaction screening was performed with the standard T3 primer as the vector-anchored primer and with either primer A5′ (5′-CAACGCTGAAGTCATCATC-3′), G5′ (5′-AAGCCTTGCATGCGTGC-3′), or H5′ (5′-GGATTTGAACCACGACAAC-3′) for amplifying sequences upstream of clones A1, G1, and H, respectively. A first set of primer extention reactions (linear amplification) were carried out in a total volume of 50 “μ”l with 5 “μ”l of amplified library as template, 0.2 “μ”m specific primer, 200 “μ”m of each dNTP, and 1 unit of DyNAzyme II DNA polymerase (Finnzyme) in DyNAzyme reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, at 25 °C, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1“%” Triton X-100). After 35 cycles, 5 “μ”l of these reactions were used as templates for exponential amplification reactions under the same conditions as above, but with the inclusion of 1 “μ”m of T3 primer. Amplified fragments were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, gel purified, and cloned in pBluescript II. Total RNA was prepared from day 4–5 animals by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction, and the poly(A)+ fraction was isolated by two rounds of oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. Aliquots of 500 ng of the poly(A)+ fraction were electrophoresed through a 2.2m formaldehyde, 1“%” agarose gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, APBiotech) by capillary blotting. The RNA was fixed to the wet membrane by UV cross-linking with 150.000 “μ”J/cm2 at 254 nm with a Hoefer UVC 500 Ultraviolet Cross-linker (APBiotech). Purified DNA fragments were radioactively labeled by random priming with the T7 Quick Prime kit (APBiotech), and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by Sephadex G-50 spun column chromatography (APBiotech). Membranes were prehybridized and hybridized in 250 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 7“%” SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1“%” bovine serum albumin and washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1“%” SDS, 1 mm EDTA. Hybridized blots were analyzed with a FLA 2000 phosphoimager and Image Gauge software (Fuji). For whole mount in situ hybridization, sense and antisense RNA probes were synthesized by in vitro transcription of linearized plasmids containing the appropriate inserts with either T7 or T3 RNA polymerase (Promega) in the presence of digoxigenin-labeled UTP (digoxigenin RNA Labeling Mix; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Day 2–3 animals were fixed with 4“%” paraformaldehyde in 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, and 500 mm NaCl for 20 min and digested with 10 “μ”g/ml proteinase K in the same buffer for 3 min at 37 °C. Specimens were post-fixed for 5 min with the same fixing solution as above. Prehybridization (2 h) and hybridization were carried out in 50“%” deionized formamide, 5× SSC, 2“%” blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1“%” Triton X-100, and 9.2 mm citric acid at 60 °C. Probes were diluted at 400 ng/ml in hybridization mixture and denatured at 85 °C for 5 min before being added to the specimens and incubated overnight. Samples were washed once with 4× SSC, 50“%” formamide, 0.1“%” Triton X-100 for 30 min at 37 °C; once with 2× SSC, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1“%” Triton X-100 for 30 min at 37 °C; and twice with 0.5× SSC, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1“%” Triton X-100 for 30 min at 65 °C. Hybridized specimens were blocked with 1“%” blocking reagent in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1“%” Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated in the same medium containing 2 “μ”g/ml of either fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 40 min at room temperature. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1“%” Triton X-100 for 30 min, specimens were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed with a Leica TCS laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 40× Leica oil immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.25–0.75). Images were acquired with Leica PowerScan software. Parallel hybridizations with sense RNA probes were run as controls. To avoid contamination of house protein preparations by algae and bacteria, all preparations were made using noninflated prehouse rudiments (Fig.1). Several solubilization procedures were tested, including sonication, detergent extraction, and guanidine HCl extraction. Denaturation by heating in the presence of 1“%” SDS, followed by titration of SDS with CHAPS was the most effective. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE of solubilized and reduced house material yielded several bands within a range of molecular mass from 5 to over 200 kDa (Fig. 2). Among these, a broad, prominent band at 36 kDa and several sharper bands appeared as clear bands upon neutral and particularly upon ammoniacal silver staining (data not shown). Both molecular mass heterogeneity and negative staining are associated with highly glycosylated proteins, such as proteoglycans and mucins (13Møller H. Poulsen J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Jay G. Culp D. Jahnke M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Following combined periodic acid oxidation-alcian blue-silver staining, specific for highly glycosylated proteins, most of these bands were positively stained (Fig. 2). Different glycosidases were employed to reduce polypeptide heterogeneity. After digestion with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), which hydrolyzes the linkage between asparagine andN-acetylglucosamine common to all N-linked oligosaccharides, a shift to lower molecular masses was observed for several polypeptides (Fig. 2 A). The heterogeneous band at 36 kDa disappeared, probably giving rise to some of the lower molecular mass species that appeared following this treatment. After simultaneous digestion with PNGase F and a broad spectrum neuraminidase, all bands larger than 70 kDa disappeared, but neuraminidase action produced a heavy background on gels stained with the combined alcian blue-periodic acid oxidation-silver procedure. When the gel was neutral silver stained, the pattern was very simple, with only a few peptide bands detectable. Two dimensional electrophoresis of a sample treated the same way showed that at least 20 polypeptide species were detected and that pI heterogeneity was still present in some of them (Fig.2 B). The electrophoretic patterns from repeated independent preparations were consistent, and no differences were observed when these preparations where digested in the presence or absence of a broad spectrum mixture of protease inhibitors. Thus, these deglycosylation treatments resulted in substantial decreases in molecular mass profiles, indicating extensive glycosylation of house proteins, and the large shifts resulting from treatment with neuraminidase alone suggest that sialic acid moieties were abundant. In contrast to PNGase F and neuraminidase treatments, addition ofO-glycosidase (endo-α-acetylgalactosaminidase) to house rudiment preparations had no detectable effect on the electrophoretic pattern. O-Glycosidase hydrolyzes the bond between serine or threonine and acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) in the disaccharide core unit Gal“β”1–3GalNAc when the latter is not substituted by sialic acid or other oligosaccharides. Therefore, our result is not surprising, because the Gal“β”1–3GalNAc core unit is only present in a subset ofO-linked oligosaccharides and a significant amount of this linkage unit would be required to see detectable molecular mass shifts. Most of the glycosaminoglycans found in proteoglycans and the oligosaccharide chains of mucins are linked to serine and threonine through different saccharide moieties. To isolate cDNA clones encoding house components, bands prepared from one-dimensional SDS-PAGE separation of PNGase F digested house proteins were subjected to nanoelectrospray-tandem mass spectrometry. Neuraminidase treatment was omitted because it added several enzyme bands/spots that co-migrated with house peptide bands/spots in both one- and two-dimensional separations. The most abundant polypeptide bands were cut out of the gel, digested with trypsin, eluted, and microsequenced. Two bands at 96 kDa were insufficiently separated and were processed as a single band labeled G in Fig.3. The peptide sequences obtained by microsequencing are shown in Fig. 3. One of the peptide sequences from band A (bold type in Fig.3) matched perfectly with the partial sequence of a 3372-bp cDNA clone (clone A1) from an Oikopleura cDNA shotgun sequencing effort. 2H.-C. Seo, unpublished data.To isolate additional clones, degenerate oligonucleotides were designed from selected peptide sequences obtained from bands G, H, N, and I (bold type in Fig. 3). These oligonucleotides were radioactively labeled, pooled, and used as probes to screen a cDNA library. Thirty-six clones were isolated, and partial sequencing revealed that the amino acid sequences deduced from reading frames present in 20 of them matched with microsequenced peptides. Eighteen of these clones encoded polypeptides matching peptides derived from band G (G clones), one for a polypeptide matching peptides from band H (clone H), and one matched all seven peptides from band A (clone A2), although no probe sequence derived from band A was used in this screening (see below). The nucleotide sequence of this clone was identical to clone A1 but had an additional 1173 bp at the 5′ end. The partial sequences of the remaining 14 clones did not show significant matches to any of the sequenced peptides. BLAST-X homology searches showed that seven of these clones encoded polypeptides similar to known mammalian proteins with functions not obviously related to house polypeptides (E values between 10−15 and 10−110on nonredundant NCBI data bases). The remaining seven clones did not show significant homology to any known protein in the same data bases (E value ≤ 10−11). Because only partial sequences of the latter clones were obtained, it is possible that unsequenced portions match some of the sequenced house peptides. These clones have not yet been further characterized. On the basis of alignments of partial sequences, restriction pattern analysis, and matches with the peptides derived from band G, there were three distinct types of G clones. The longest clones of each type, G1, G2a, and G2b were 2542, 2552, and 2559 bp long, respectively, and were completely sequenced. Clones G1 and G2 share an overall identity of 71“%” at the nucleotide level and code for polypeptides that show an identity of 70“%” (Fig. 4 A). Clone G2a differs from G2b by only a few residues, a difference probably caused by allelic polymorphism. Out of the 18 G clones, 13 were of the G1 type, 3 of the G2a type, and 2 of the G2b type. This is consistent with the presence of multiple bands in the gel slice labeled G. Clone H, 2189 bp, was also completely sequenced. Translations of clones A1, G1, G2a, G2b, and H showed uninterrupted reading frames starting from the 5′ end, but there were no putative starting methionine residues and no signal peptides predicted for any of them, indicating that all fo"
https://openalex.org/W2129944356,"A temperature-sensitiveSaccharomyces cerevisiae mutant harboring a lesion in theERG26 gene has been isolated. ERG26 encodes 4α-carboxysterol-C3 dehydrogenase, one of three enzymatic activities required for the conversion of 4,4-dimethylzymosterol to zymosterol. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses of sterols in this mutant, designated erg26-1, revealed the aberrant accumulation of a 4-methyl-4-carboxy zymosterol intermediate, as well as a novel 4-carboxysterol. Neutral lipid radiolabeling studies showed that erg26-1 cells also harbored defects in the rate of biosynthesis and steady-state levels of mono-, di-, and triglycerides. Phospholipid radiolabeling studies showed defects in the rate of biosynthesis of both phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol. Biochemical studies revealed that microsomes isolated from erg26-1 cells contained greatly reduced 4α-carboxysterol-C3 dehydrogenase activity when compared with microsomes from wild type cells. Previous studies have shown that loss of function mutations in either of the fatty acid elongase genesSUR4/ELO3 or FEN1/GNS1/ELO2 can “bypass” the essentiality of certain ERG genes (Ladeveze, V., Marcireau, C., Delourme, D., and Karst, F.

(1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16, 2719–2727). Studies presented here have shown that this sphingolipid-dependent “bypass” mechanism did not suppress the essential requirement for zymosterol biosynthesis. However, studies aimed at understanding the underlying physiology behind the temperature-sensitive growth defect of erg26-1cells showed that the addition of several antifungal compounds to the growth media of erg26-1 cells could suppress the temperature-sensitive growth defect. Fluorescence microscopic analysis showed that GFP-Erg26p and GFP-Erg27p fusion proteins were localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Two-hybrid analysis indicated that Erg25p, Erg26p, and Erg27p, which are required for the biosynthesis of zymosterol, form a complex within the cell.

Two-hybrid analysis indicated that Erg25p, Erg26p, and Erg27p, which are required for the biosynthesis of zymosterol, form a complex within the cell. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model system for studying sterol biosynthesis and regulation (1Lees N.D. Bard M. Kirsch D.R. Parish E.J.N. Nes D.W. Biochemistry and Function of Sterols.CRC Press, Inc. 1997; : 85-99Google Scholar, 2Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Yeast.. 1998; 14: 1471-1510Google Scholar). The sterol biosynthetic pathway in this yeast is highly conserved with its mammalian counterpart. The difference being that ergosterol is synthesized as the end product sterol rather than cholesterol. All of the structural genes have been cloned that are required for the biosynthetic steps necessary to synthesize sterols inS. cerevisiae (1Lees N.D. Bard M. Kirsch D.R. Parish E.J.N. Nes D.W. Biochemistry and Function of Sterols.CRC Press, Inc. 1997; : 85-99Google Scholar, 2Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Yeast.. 1998; 14: 1471-1510Google Scholar). In addition, many of the enzyme activities involved in yeast sterol synthesis have been characterized with respect to their enzymological parameters (3Bottema C.K. Parks L.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1978; 531: 301-307Google Scholar, 4Osumi T. Nishino T. Katsuki H. J Biochem. (Tokyo).. 1979; 85: 819-826Google Scholar, 5Aoyama Y. Yoshida Y. Sonoda Y. Sato Y. J. Biol.

Kelly D.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 9986-9988Google Scholar). Moreover, some physiological functions for yeast sterols have been assigned using constitutive sterol mutants (2Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Yeast.. 1998; 14: 1471-1510Google Scholar, 8Parks L.W. Smith S.J. Crowley J.H. Lipids.. 1995; 30: 227-230Google Scholar, 9Welihinda A.A. Beavis A.D. Trumbly R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1994; 1193: 107-117Google Scholar). One of the later steps in the sterol pathway is the conversion of 4,4-dimethylzymosterol to zymosterol (1Lees N.D. Bard M. Kirsch D.R. Parish E.J.N. Nes D.W. Biochemistry and Function of Sterols.CRC Press, Inc. 1997; : 85-99Google Scholar). The reaction is carried out in two sequential demethylation reactions by three separate enzyme activities. In mammalian and plant cells, the activities required, a C-4 methyl oxidase, a 4α-carboxysterol-C3 dehydrogenase (C-4 decarboxylase) (4α-CD),1and a C-3 ketoreductase, have been characterized from partially purified preparations (10Rahimtula A.D.

These analyses have given an excellent insight into the steps involved in C-4 demethylation. The first step is initiated by the C-4 methyl oxidase, whereby this enzyme converts the C-4α methyl group of 4,4-dimethylzymosterol to alcohol and aldehyde intermediates and then to a carboxylic acid. Next, the carboxyl group is removed by the 4α-CD, with epimerization of the 4β-methyl group to a 4α stereochemistry and a 3-keto group being formed during this step. Finally, the 3-keto group is reduced to a β-hydroxy sterol by the 3-ketoreductase. The next round of demethylation is initiated once the second methyl group translocates to the C-4α position. In S. cerevisiae, the C-4 methyl oxidase, 4α-CD, and C-3 ketoreductase required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethylzymosterol are encoded for by the ERG25 (16Bard M. Bruner D.A. Pierson C.A. Lees N.D. Biermann B. Frye L. Koegel C. Barbuch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 186-190Google Scholar), ERG26(17Gachotte D. Barbuch R. Gaylor J. Nickel E. Bard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 13794-13799Google Scholar), and ERG27 (18Gachotte D. Sen S.E. Eckstein J. Barbuch R. Krieger M. Ray B.D. Bard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 12655-12660Google Scholar) genes, respectively. All three genes are essential under aerobic growth conditions. However, viable single null mutants have been constructed by genetic means. These strains have been very useful in determining the changes in sterol composition due to the individual loss of function of these genes. Yeast strains lacking the ERG25 gene accumulate the substrate of the Erg25p, 4,4-dimethylzymosterol (16Bard M. Bruner D.A. Pierson C.A. Lees N.D. Biermann B. Frye L. Koegel C. Barbuch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 186-190Google Scholar), whereas strains lackingERG26 accumulate the expected 4-methyl carboxy substrate intermediates (17Gachotte D. Barbuch R. Gaylor J. Nickel E. Bard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 13794-13799Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutants lacking ERG27function accumulate very little cyclic sterols (18Gachotte D. Sen S.E. Eckstein J. Barbuch R. Krieger M. Ray B.D. Bard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 12655-12660Google Scholar). However,erg27Δ mutants can be made to accumulate the expected 3-keto sterols if they are fed lanosterol, a sterol intermediate that is an upstream precursor of the substrate for the Erg27p-directed 3-ketoreductase reaction. A yeast erg25 mutant has been isolated through a screen selecting for mutants unable to grow on low iron media (19Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 16927-16933Google Scholar). Interestingly, exogenous iron transport activity in thiserg25 mutant is normal, suggesting that the changes in zymosterol intermediate levels seen in these cells are not affecting iron uptake but another intracellular process. In mammalian cells, a cholesterol auxotrophic Chinese hamster ovary cell line has been isolated that accumulates carboxysterols (20Berry D.J. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry.. 1982; 21: 573-580Google Scholar, 21Plemenitas A. Havel C.M. Watson J.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 17012-17017Google Scholar). The lesion responsible for the sterol metabolic defect is thought to reside within the gene encoding for 4α-CD activity, because this activity is almost completely lacking in these cells. In this report, we describe the isolation and initial characterization of the erg26-1 conditional growth mutant. By using various analytical and biochemical methods, we demonstrate thaterg26-1 cells are defective in 4α-CD activity and in zymosterol biosynthesis, whereby they accumulate aberrant zymosterol intermediates. Additional lipid metabolic labeling studies show thaterg26-1 cells also harbor defects in neutral lipid and phospholipid biosynthesis and metabolism. Furthermore, by using specific pharmacological agents, we demonstrate that the conditional growth phenotype of erg26-1 cells is due to the toxic accumulation of zymosterol intermediates at high temperatures rather than the loss of ergosterol biosynthesis. Further studies show that this toxic phenotype cannot be suppressed by mutations in sphingolipid biosynthesis that previously have been shown to suppress ERGgene essentiality (22Ladeveze V. Marcireau C. Delourme D. Karst F. Lipids.. 1993; 28: 907-912Google Scholar, 23Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C. Rahier A. Taton M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Loison G. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1996; 16: 2719-2727Google Scholar). Finally, by using fluorescence microscopy and two-hybrid analysis, we demonstrate that Erg26p and Erg27p both localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and that Erg25p physically associates with Erg26p and Erg27p within the cell. The yeast strains used in this study are isogenic to W303-1A (MATaleu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 can1-100). Yeast strains were grown in either YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) or in synthetic minimal media containing 0.67% Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids, adenine, and uracil. When required, media was supplemented with 15 μg/ml ergosterol as described previously (24Lorenz R.T. Rodriguez R.J. Lewis T.A. Parks L.W. J. Bacteriol... 1986; 167: 981-985Google Scholar). 5-FOA plates contained 0.1% 5-FOA. Yeast transformation was performed using the procedure described by Ito (25Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol... 1983; 153: 163-168Google Scholar). For routine propagation of plasmids, Escherichia coliXL1Blue cells were used and grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (150 μg/ml). Bacterial transformations were carried out by electroporation. Yeast null mutants were generated by the one-step disruption method of Rothstein (26Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol... 1991; 194: 281-301Google Scholar) using individual Yeast Integrating plasmid (YIp) deletion constructs (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics.. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). Yeast strains harboring individual deletions were verified by PCR analysis. The URA3-containing centromeric plasmid pRS414 was used to construct the various low copy ERG vectors (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics.. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar).pGAL-GFP is a LEU2 containing derivative of the centromeric vector YCpIF3 (28Foreman P.K. Davis R.W. Gene.. 1994; 144: 63-68Google Scholar). The GFP sequence contained in this vector harbors an S65A mutation (29Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene.. 1996; 173: 33-38Google Scholar). The two hybrid vectors pBD-Gal4 Cam (CLONTECH) and pACT2 (Stratagene) were used in the two hybrid studies. All genomic sequences subcloned into the various vectors were obtained by PCR amplification using high fidelity pfu polymerase. All DNA sequences that were generated by PCR were sequenced and compared with the yeast genome data base. The ERG25 sequence used in our two-hybrid studies lacked the C-terminal sequences encoding for the consensus ER retention signal. pJR1133-SUT1 and the parent plasmid pJR1133 are 2μ plasmids that carry the URA3 gene. Drs. Chris Beh and Jasper Rine (University of California, Berkeley, CA) kindly provided them. W303-1A was mutagenized with ethylmethane sulfunate by standard procedures (30Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics..Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 1982; : 170-185Google Scholar) and grown on inositol-free synthetic media for 3 days at 25 °C. Colonies were transferred and grown on filter paper replicas and labeled with 100 μCi of [3H]inositol, essentially as described previously (31Leidich S.D. Drapp D.A. Orlean P. Methods Enzymol... 1995; 250: 560-571Google Scholar). After labeling for 40 min at restrictive temperature (41 °C), filters were washed two times with 5% trichloroacetic acid, air-dried, and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film for 6 days. Following exposure, the filters were treated sequentially with the following solvents to chemically deacylate and remove the [3H]inositol incorporated into phosphatidylinositol:0.2n KOH in methanol/toluene (1:1, v/v) at room temperature for 60 min, methanol for 10 min, 5% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min, and twice more in methanol for 10 min each. Filters were dried, sprayed with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 18 h. The signal intensity for each colony before and after deacylation was compared, and isolates that had reduced signal after deacylation relative to their initial signal were selected and grown. The entire labeling procedure was repeated on the selected colonies as described, except radioactivity was quantified on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using a tritium-sensitive screen. Sphingolipid metabolic mutant H21 was transformed with a YCp50-based yeast genomic low copy library (32Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene.. 1987; 60: 237-243Google Scholar). Transformed H21 cells were plated onto synthetic plates lacking uracil, and plasmids harboring yeast sequences conferring temperature resistance were selected for at 37 °C. Plasmid YCp50-16-1-1 was chosen as a representative suppressor plasmid (Fig. 1 A) based on restriction analyses of 12 independent suppressor plasmids. DNA sequencing analysis and subcloning experiments revealed that theERG26 gene was responsible for conferring temperature resistance to H21. Linkage analysis was used to confirm that theERG26 gene was mutated in the H21 mutant strain and that the mutation was recessive. Several backcrosses were performed on the H21 strain to obtain the haploid segregant designated erg26-1. The ts and lipid metabolic phenotypes of erg26-1are identical to that of H21. Starting cultures for all labeling experiments were derived from exponential cells grown at 23 °C in the described media. For pulse labeling of phospholipids, cells grown in synthetic media were shifted to 23 or 37 °C and incubated with 50 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 20 min. For steady-state labeling of phospholipids, 0.05 A600/ml cells grown in synthetic media were shifted to 23 or 37 °C and incubated with 10 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for at least six generations. Phospholipids were extracted using the spheroplast method of Atkinson and Henry (33Atkinson K. Fogel S. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1980; 255: 6653-6661Google Scholar) and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC as described previously (34Fine J.B. Sprecher H. J. Lipid Res... 1982; 23: 660-663Google Scholar). For pulse and steady-state labeling of neutral lipids and sterols, cells grown in synthetic media were shifted to 23 or 37 °C and incubated with 1 μCi/ml [14C]acetate for 30 min or 4 h, respectively. Radiolabeled neutral and sterol lipids were extracted using chloroform, methanol (2:1) and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC using hexane, ethyl ether, acetic acid (80:20:2) and petroleum ether, diethyl ether, acetic acid (70:30:1), respectively (35Wu W.I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales T.R. Merrill A.H.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 13171-13178Google Scholar). In all cases, radiolabeled lipids were visualized by x-ray film (Kodak XAR5). The percent value of each lipid species was determined by densitometry using a Bio-Rad Model GS-670 Imaging Densitometer and Molecular Analyst Software Version 1.4.1. Yeast cells were disrupted by glass bead homogenization (0.45-mm diameter) in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1.5 mm reduced glutathione and 30 mm nicotinamide for 8 min at 0 °C. The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Microsomes were then isolated by centrifuging the cell extract supernatant at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The resulting microsomal pellet was resuspended in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 3 mm reduced glutathione and 20% glycerol (v/v) using an Elvehjem-Potter homogenizer. Microsomes (0.4 ml = 1 mg of protein) were incubated in the presence of 100–200 μm exogenous synthetic 4α-carboxy-5α-cholest-7-en-3β-ol that had been emulsified in 1 g/liter Tween 80, and 200 μm NAD+. Incubations were continued aerobically at 30 °C with gentle stirring for 50 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 6% KOH/EtOH. After addition of a known amount of coprostanone (2–10 μg) as an internal standard, the incubation mixture was extracted three times with a total volume of 15 ml of n-hexane. After drying with Na2SO4, the extract was concentrated to dryness and analyzed by TLC on silica gel eluted with CH2CL2 (two developments). The fraction migrating as authentic standards of coprostanone and Δ7-cholestenone and containing the enzymatically produced Δ7-cholestenone (RF = 0.50–0.70) was eluted and analyzed by GLC using a fused-silica capillary column DB1 (240–280 °C, 2 °C/min) and hydrogen as the carrier gas. The amount of Δ7-cholestenone produced (tR = 1.11) was calculated from the amount of coprostanone (tR = 1.0) and the area of their respective peaks, allowing the rate of the reaction to be determined. The ketone metabolite and other endogenous sterones (if present) were identified by capillary GLC and coupled GLC-MS analysis. The ketone metabolite produced by the reaction was thus unequivocally identified as cholest-7-en-3-one by coincidental retention time in GLC and by an electron impact spectrum identical to that of an authentic synthetic standard. The 4α-carboxy-7-en-3β-ol substrate was synthesized as described previously (15Rondet S. Taton M. Rahier A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys... 1999; 366: 249-260Google Scholar). Yeast cells were hydrolyzed in 1n ethanolic NaOH and extracted exhaustively with ethyl acetate. The extract was treated with diazomethane to form the methyl esters of any free carboxyl groups and then with Sil-Prep (Supelco) to form the trimethylsilyl ethers of free hydroxyl substituents. The sample was then dissolved in hexane and injected onto a 30-m HP-5MS capillary column (Agilent Technologies) installed in an HP 6890 gas-chromatograph interfaced with an HP 5972A mass selective detector. After the injection, the column was kept at 100 °C for 2 min then raised to 265 °C at a rate of 35 °C/min. The carried gas was helium at a flow rate of ∼1 ml/min. For the analysis of the reaction products formed in the 4α-carboxysterol-C3 dehydrogenase assay, MS and GLC/MS were determined at 70 eV with a Fisons MD800 spectrometer. The GLC separation was carried out with a Varian 3400 CX GLC instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector and a fused-silica capillary column (30-m length; 0.32-mm inner diameter) × 0.25-μm film coated with DB5 (H2, flow 2 ml/min). The temperature program used included a 30 °C/min rise from 60 to 240 °C followed by a 2 °C/min rise from 240 to 280 °C. Relative retention times (tR) are given with respect to cholesterol (tR = 1). 1 × 105cells were spotted onto YEPD plates lacking or containing the indicated antifungal compounds. The plates were then incubated at either 23 or 37 °C for 4 days. Alternatively, 2-ml cultures of various yeast strains were grown to 0.5–1.0 A600 at 23 °C and subsequently inoculated at 1.0 × 105 cells/ml into 96-well microtiter dishes containing YEPD and various concentrations of antifungal compounds. Cells were then allowed to grow at either 23 or 37 °C for several days without shaking, and the cell number was determined by plate viability assays. The degree of reduction in the accumulation of sterol intermediates due to antifungal supplementation was determined by [14C]acetate and TLC analyses. A screen was initiated to isolate yeast mutants having defects in sphingolipid metabolism. Because S. cerevisiaecells incorporate inositol into complex sphingolipids, the strategy was to look for temperature-sensitive (ts) loss of function mutations that reduced or eliminated the incorporation of [3H]inositol into the yeast cell membrane. Among thets mutants obtained, a sphingolipid biosynthetic mutant was isolated whose ts phenotype was suppressed in low copy by the ERG26 gene (Fig.1 A). ERG26 is believed to encode for the 4α-CD activity in S. cerevisiae(17Gachotte D. Barbuch R. Gaylor J. Nickel E. Bard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 13794-13799Google Scholar). Linkage analysis was performed in this mutant, designated H21, and showed that the mutation responsible for the ts defect resided within the ERG26 gene. H21 was backcrossed several times to the parental W303-1A wild-type strain and anerg26-1 haploid segregant was generated. We used thiserg26-1 strain to examine in greater detail the defects in sterol lipid biosynthesis brought about by mutating ERG26and to determine whether neutral lipid and phospholipid biosynthesis were also perturbed. We first analyzed the sterol lipid composition of wild type anderg26-1 mutants using lipid radiolabeling studies and TLC. Studies were carried out at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures for erg26-1 cell growth. Using [14C] acetate labeling and TLC, we found thaterg26-1 mutant cells accumulated two lipid species that are not seen in wild type cells (Fig. 1 B; ERG26 versus erg26-1). Under the conditions of our analysis, the two species migrated within the first one-third of the TLC plate (RF 0.06 and 0.21). Both lipids were found to accumulate at either temperature in erg26-1 cells, but to a much greater degree at the nonpermissive temperature for growth (Fig.1, erg26-1, 23° versus erg26-1, 37°). We found that we could greatly reduce the accumulation of these lipids inerg26-1 cells at either temperature by introducing the wild type ERG26 gene on a low copy plasmid (Fig. 1 B;erg26-1 pRS-ERG26; 37° shown). Thus, the expression of ERG26 in single copy nearly eliminated the accumulation of the two aberrant lipid species found inerg26-1 cells. This result is to be expected, because our linkage analysis did reveal that a recessive mutation resided within the ERG26 gene in erg26-1 cells. As a means to determine the molecular structures of these aberrant lipid species, GC/MS analyses were performed on total sterol extracts from wild type and erg26-1 cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature. GC analyses of these extracts revealed the presence of several lipid peaks, with peaks 1 through 5 being detected in both wild type and erg26-1 cells (Fig.2, A and B). However, there were three additional peaks detected inerg26-1 cells that were not seen in wild type cells (Fig. 2,A versus B). The three peaks, designated 6, 7, and 8, had retention times of 35.09, 38.73, and 39.32 min, respectively (TableI). The molecular structures of all of the peaks detected by GC are outlined in Table I and are based on our MS analyses. Using the MS data obtained, we identified peaks 1, 2, 4, and 5 as ergosterol, fecosterol, lanosterol, and 14-methylfecosterol, respectively. We were unable to predict the molecular structure of peak 3.Table ISterols detected in wild type and erg26–1 cellsPeak no.Retention timeKnown sterol or proposed sterol structuremin121.37Ergosterol223.52Fecosterol323.85Unknown424.95Lanosterol525.9514-Methyl-fecosterol635.094-Carboxy-zymosterol738.734-Methyl-4-carboxy-zymosterol839.32Epimer of peak 7 Open table in a new tab The MS spectra of peaks 6 and 7 are shown in Fig.3. They are consistent with these sterol intermediates being the methyl esters of a 4-methyl-4-carboxy-diunsaturated sterol (Fig. 3 A, peak 7) and a 4-carboxy-diunsaturated sterol (Fig. 3 B,peak 6). Based on the reaction mechanism involved in the demethylation of 4,4-dimethylzymosterol, we believe that these intermediates are the methyl esters of the expected substrate for Erg26p, 4β-methyl-4α-carboxy-cholesta-8,24-dien-3β-ol (Fig.3 A), and a novel sterol compound, 4α-carboxy-cholesta-8,24–3β-ol (Fig. 3 B). The 4β-methyl-4α-carboxy-cholesta-8,24-dien-3β-ol previously has been shown to accumulate in strains completely lacking the ERG26gene (17Gachotte D. Barbuch R. Gaylor J. Nickel E. Bard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 13794-13799Google Scholar). We must point out that additional NMR studies will be required to verify definitively the position of the double bonds and the stereochemistry of the 4-carboxy group in these sterol derivatives. However, this is the first identification of a 4-carboxy-diunstaurated sterol species in yeast. Using the MS data obtained, we have predicted that peak 8 is an epimer of peak 7. To begin to ascertain the biochemical basis for the accumulation of these sterol intermediates in erg26-1 cells, 4α-CD activity was assayed in wild type and erg26-1 microsomal extracts. The results from these studies revealed that a microsomal extract obtained from wild type cells grown at the permissive temperature was able to decarboxylate the 4α-CD substrate, 4α-carboxy-7-en-3β-ol (15Rondet S. Taton M. Rahier A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys... 1999; 366: 249-260Google Scholar) (TableII). In contrast, the level of 4α-CD activity in microsomes from erg26-1 cells grown at the permissive temperature was reduced by 50% compared with that of the wild type activity. Wild type C-3 sterol dehydrogenase activity could be restored to erg26-1 cells by introducing the wild typeERG26 gene on a low copy plasmid (Table I,erg26-1 pRS-ERG26). Thus, erg26-1cells do contain weakened 4α-CD activity.Table II4α-Carboxysterol-C3 dehydrogenase activity in wild type and erg26–1 cellsStrain4α-Carboxysterol-C3 dehydrogenase relative activityWild type100erg26–145 ± 2erg26–1 pRS-ERG26112 ± 44α-Carboxysterol-C3 dehydrogenase activity was measured at 30 °C.

Glycobiology. 1997; 7: v-viiiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each member of the family shares the same overall domain organization, with an extracellular region consisting of an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain followed by a fibronectin type II repeat and 8 or 10 domains related in sequence to the C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs)1 of animal lectins. The mannose receptor and one other member of the family, endothelial receptor Endo-180, are true C-type lectins, binding carbohydrates in a Ca2+-dependent manner (2Taylor M.E. Conary J.T.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-type lectin-like domains of the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor and the dendritic cell receptor DEC-205 do not contain the conserved residues necessary for Ca2+-dependent sugar binding, and these two receptors do not bind carbohydrates (4Lambeau G.

Nature. 1995; 375: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Each of the receptors mediates endocytosis, but physiological ligands have only been identified for the mannose receptor and the phospholipase A2 receptor. The mannose receptor acts as a molecular scavenger, binding and internalizing pathogenic microorganisms and potentially harmful glycoproteins (7Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 8Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The multiple domains in the extracellular region of the receptor allow recognition of a diverse range of glycoconjugate ligands. Several of the eight C-type CRDs are involved in Ca2+-dependent recognition of terminal mannose,N-acetylglucosamine or fucose residues on the surfaces of microorganisms or on the oligosaccharides of endogenous glycoproteins (9Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor plays a role in the immune response against pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis andPneumocystis carinii. It also regulates levels of endogenous proteins such as lysosomal enzymes and tissue plasminogen activator released from cells in response to pathological events. In addition, the mannose receptor binds terminal sulfatedN-acetylgalactosamine residues on oligosaccharides of the pituitary hormones lutropin and thyrotropin and plays a role in clearing these hormones from the circulation after they have acted on their target cells (11Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14629-14637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Fiete D. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11256-11261Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich domain of the mannose receptor recognizes sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine by a mechanism distinct from that of the C-type CRDs (13Fiete D. Beranek M.C. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2089-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Liu Y. Chirino A.J. Leteux C. Feizi T. Misulovin Z. Nussenzweig M.C. Bjorkman P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Individual C-type CRDs of the mannose receptor show only weak affinity for monosaccharides. High affinity binding to the receptor requires multivalent interactions of oligosaccharides involving several CRDs (9Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mullin N.P. Hitchen P.G. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5668-5681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CRDs 4 and 5 form a protease-resistant ligand-binding core sufficient to bind some ligands but CRDs 4–8 are required for high affinity binding to natural ligands such as yeast mannan. It is likely that the presence of multiple C-type CRDs within the single polypeptide chain of the mannose receptor is important in determining specificity as well as affinity for oligosaccharide ligands, because the spatial arrangement of the CRDs must influence which ligands are able to interact in a multivalent manner. The importance of the spatial arrangement of C-type CRDs in defining ligand selectivity is illustrated by serum mannose-binding protein, in which the orientation of the three CRDs in each trimer is fixed so that mammalian oligosaccharides cannot be recognized and inappropriate complement fixation does not occur (8Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The mannose receptor is unusual when compared with other multidomain cell surface receptors in that the domains that seem to be most important for ligand binding, CRDs 4 and 5, are in the middle of the polypeptide rather than at the end. The fifth of the eight C-type lectin-like domains of the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor is also most important for binding of secretory phospholipases (16Nicolas J.-P. Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28869-28873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). One explanation for this phenomenon could be that the extracellular regions of each of these receptors adopt a U-shaped conformation rather than extending linearly from the cell surface (Fig. 1) (8Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Such an arrangement would put CRDs 4 and 5 furthest from the membrane. This paper describes hydrodynamic analysis of the mannose receptor combined with analysis of protease resistance. The results indicate that the receptor is likely to adopt an extended conformation with contacts between some domains. Sepharose 6B, α-d-methylmannopyranoside and molecular weight markers for gel filtration were obtained from Sigma. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate was obtained from Pierce. Endoglycosidase H and peptide N-glycosidase F were from New England Biolabs. Methotrexate, dialyzed fetal calf serum, and all media were obtained from Life Technologies. Mannose-Sepharose was prepared using the divinyl sulfone method (17Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Production of Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing the extracellular region of the mannose receptor (MMR-S) and a fragment containing only the eight CRDs (MMR1–8) has been described previously (18Simpson D.Z. Hitchen P.G. Elmhirst E.L. Taylor M.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both cell lines were maintained in α-minimal essential medium without nucleosides or deoxyribonucleosides, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 0.5 μm methotrexate. Following growth to confluence, cells expressing MMR-S were changed into serum-free medium (Chinese hamster ovary-S-SFM II) without nucleosides, supplemented with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.55, 0.11 μm CaCl2, and 5 μmmethotrexate. Cells expressing MMR1–8 were kept in serum-containing medium after growth to confluence. In each case, medium was changed and collected every 3 days. MMR-S and MMR1–8 were isolated from the medium by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose as described previously (18Simpson D.Z. Hitchen P.G. Elmhirst E.L. Taylor M.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). MMR1–8 was separated from trace serum contaminants by cation-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono-S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein was loaded in 20 mmMOPS, pH 6.0, and eluted with a gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in the same buffer. MMR-S isolated from serum-free medium required no further purification. Pure protein fractions were concentrated if necessary using a Centricon-30 micro-concentrator (Millipore). MMR1–8 (0.2 mg) was treated with endoglycosidase H (20,000 units) in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, or with peptideN-glycosidase F (10,000 units) in 1 ml of 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C overnight. Enzymes were separated from MMR1–8 by anion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein was loaded in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in the same buffer. Samples of MMR-S and MMR1–8 (100 pmol/μl) were analyzed on a FinneganMAT Lasermat mass spectrometer. Sinapinic acid applied to the target at 7 mg/ml in 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix. Ten spectra were collected for each sample in positive ion mode, each spectrum consisting of signals averaged from 10 to 30 consecutive laser pulses. Dimeric bovine serum albumin ([M + H])+ = 132,860 Da) was used as a calibration standard. All experiments were carried out at 20 °C in the An60Ti rotor of a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics. Before analysis, protein samples were dialyzed overnight against an appropriate buffer. For equilibrium sedimentation experiments, five absorbance readings were taken after samples were equilibrated for 24 h at 6,000 rpm and a further five readings were made after 24 h equilibration at 7,000 rpm. Two further scans were taken after overspinning at 48,000 rpm to obtain background absorbance readings. Data from three different loading concentrations and the two different rotor speeds were analyzed simultaneously using the non-linear curve-fitting program Nonlin. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 30,000 rpm with absorbance readings taken at 5-min intervals over 6 h. Data were analyzed by the g(s*) method using Beckman Instruments software. Sedimentation coefficients for MMR-S and MMR1–8 in the absence of Ca2+ were also calculated by the second-moment method. Sedimentation coefficients were corrected for the effects of buffer density and viscosity (19Laue T.M. Bhairavi D.S. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Mannose receptor fragments were dialyzed into 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.15 mNaCl. In some experiments, 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm CaCl2 and 100 mmα-methylmannoside were added. Aliquots were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with different concentrations of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate before analysis by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels. Analytical gel filtration chromatography was performed on a 300 × 7.8-mm BioSep-S3000 column (Phenomenex). The column was eluted with 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) were used as standards, with RNase S peptide used as a marker of the included volume of the column. Values for the Stokes radius (RS) of protein standards were calculated from their known diffusion coefficients (20Sober H.A. Handbook of Biochemistry: Selected Data for Molecular Biology. The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1970Google Scholar). Values for the Stokes radii of MMR-S and MMR1–8 were determined from their elution positions (21Laurent T.C. Killander J. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 14: 317-330Crossref Google Scholar). MMR1–8 and MMR-S were subjected to limited trypsin digestion after adjustment of Ca2+ concentration, following previously described protocols (10Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MMR1–8 and MMR-S (0.25 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2) were incubated with increasing amounts of trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. Digestions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of double strength sample buffer and immediate heating to 100 °C for 5 min. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels, stained with Coomassie Blue, and scanned using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Digestion products separated on 15% mini-gels were subjected to N-terminal sequencing in a Beckman LF3000 protein sequencer following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (22Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partial specific volumes for MMR-S and MMR1–8 were calculated from their amino acid sequences and estimates of the extent of glycosylation (see below) using the method of Cohn and Edsall (23Cohn E.J.

Diffusion coefficients (D) for MMR-S and MMR1–8 were calculated from the Stokes radii determined by analytical gel filtration. Stokes radii were also determined from molar frictional coefficients calculated using sedimentation coefficient values and the molecular masses determined by mass spectrometry (19Laue T.M.

Hydration of 0.28 g of H2O per g of protein was assumed (19Laue T.M. Bhairavi D.S. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C.

Dimensions of MMR-S and MMR1–8 were calculated from their axial ratios using Equations 14–19 of Tanford (25Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley, New York1961Google Scholar). The program HYDRO was used to calculate sedimentation and diffusion coefficients for models of different receptor conformations (26Garcia de la Torre J. Navarro S. Carrasco B.

Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5310) Google Scholar). Spheres of 30 Å diameter were used for the CRDs, based on the crystal structures of the C-type CRD of rat mannose-binding protein A and mannose receptor CRD-4 (28Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R.

The fibronectin-type II repeat was represented by a sphere of 24 Å, based on the solution structure of the second of these domains from fibronectin (30Pickford A.R. Potts J.R. Bright J.R. Phan I. Campbell I.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 5: 359-370Google Scholar), while the cysteine-rich domain was modeled as a sphere of 32 Å based on its crystal structure (14Liu Y. Chirino A.J. Leteux C. Feizi T. Misulovin Z. Nussenzweig M.C. Bjorkman P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Linker regions between the domains were represented as four spheres of diameter 5 Å. These dimensions were based on the average length and volume calculated for stretches of 10 amino acids taken from six different regions of the rat mannose-binding protein A structure (28Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic and proteolysis experiments were carried out on two purified soluble fragments of the mannose receptor in order to examine the shape, oligomeric state and domain arrangement of the receptor. One fragment (MMR-S) consists of the whole extracellular domain of the receptor, while the other (MMR1–8) consists of just the eight C-type CRDs without the cysteine-rich domain and the fibronectin type II repeat (Fig. 1). MMR1–8 was analyzed in order to determine possible effects of the two N-terminal domains on the conformation of the receptor. Comparison of the calculated peptide molecular masses for MMR-S and MMR1–8 with the molecular masses determined by MALDI-MS (TableI) allows estimation of the extent of glycosylation of these mannose receptor fragments. The mass difference is about 20,000 Da for both MMR-S and MMR1–8. There are eight potential sites for N-linked oligosaccharides on MMR-S and seven on MMR1–8. Four sites for O-linked oligosaccharides have also been identified based on protein sequencing data (2Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennarz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The additional mass in each case was attributed to the presence of sevenN-linked biantennary complex oligosaccharides and fourO-linked disaccharides of GalNAc and GlcNAc. Partial specific volumes of 0.714 cm3/g for MMR-S and 0.717 cm3/g for MMR1–8 were calculated using these estimates of glycosylation (19Laue T.M. Bhairavi D.S. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L.

Sedimentation velocity analysis of MMR-S and MMR1–8 by analytical ultracentrifugation was used to determine sedimentation coefficients. Data were analyzed by the g(s*) method in which the distribution of sedimentation coefficients is calculated. In the absence of Ca2+, a narrow symmetrical peak is obtained for each receptor fragment indicating the presence of a single species (Fig. 2). The sedimentation coefficients obtained (Table I) are lower than would be expected for globular proteins of the same mass as the mannose receptor fragments, indicating that the receptor is asymmetric. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments show that the receptor fragments are monomeric in the absence of Ca2+. The apparent molecular mass as a function of receptor concentration remains constant across the sample cell (Fig.3, A and B) indicating that MMR-S and MMR1–8 are monomeric at all protein concentrations. Apparent molecular masses are 173,000 ± 7000 Da for MMR-S and 165,000 ± 4000 Da for MMR1–8. These values correspond closely to the values of 174,500 Da and 146,700 Da determined for MMR-S and MMR1–8 by mass spectrometry. Thus, analytical ultracentrifugation indicates that the mannose receptor is monomeric in the absence of Ca2+ and sediments at a rate consistent with an asymmetric, extended conformation.Figure 3Equilibrium sedimentation analysis of the mannose receptor. Samples of MMR-S (0.15 mg/ml) and MMR1–8 (0.2 mg/ml) were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.15m NaCl with and without 5 mm CaCl2. Cells were loaded with undiluted, 2- and 4-fold diluted samples and analyzed at 6000 rpm (open circle, open square, andopen triangle) and at 7000 rpm (open down triangle, open diamond, and open hexagon). Absorbance was measured at 233 nm for MMR-S and 236 nm for MMR1–8. Molecular masses of monomers and dimers based on mass spectrometry data are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because at least some of the C-type CRDs of the receptor bind Ca2+, sedimentation experiments were also carried out in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2. However, the results indicate that both MMR-S and MMR1–8 aggregate under these conditions. On sedimentation velocity analysis, a broad asymmetric peak is obtained for each receptor fragment, indicating the presence of multiple species (Fig. 2). Average sedimentation coefficient values of 10.02 ± 0.11 S and 9.01 ± 0.08 S were obtained from three independent sedimentation velocity experiments for MMR-S and MMR1–8, respectively. These average values are considerably higher than those obtained in the absence of Ca2+ (Table I), although overlap in the two curves indicates that a proportion of the protein in Ca2+ is monomeric (Fig. 2). Equilibrium sedimentation analysis confirms that aggregation of MMR-S and MMR1–8 occurs when Ca2+ is present. The apparent molecular mass of each receptor fragment increases as a function of concentration throughout the sample cell (Fig. 3, C and D). The fact that the curves calculated at different loading concentrations do not all overlap indicates that at least some oligomeric forms do not interconvert, consistent with aggregation. Cross-linking experiments confirm the ultracentrifugation data, with monomeric receptor fragments forming at least tetramers on addition of Ca2+ (data not shown). In the absence of Ca2+, cross-linking of monomers does not occur. Previous studies on the intact mannose receptor have suggested that the receptor is monomeric (10Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detergent-solubilized receptor sediments on a sucrose gradient as a single band at a position corresponding to a monomer. Furthermore, no evidence of oligomerization was obtained in cross-linking studies in the presence of 10 mmCa2+ (10Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, aggregation seen in the presence of Ca2+ is unlikely to be an indication of the natural state of the receptor. Binding of oligosaccharides on one receptor molecule by the CRDs of another molecule could cause Ca2+-induced association. For example, high mannose oligosaccharides or hybrid oligosaccharides with terminal mannose orN-acetylglucosamine residues could act as ligands for CRDs 4 and 5. Analytical ultracentrifugation and cross-linking carried out on receptor fragments treated with endoglycosidase H to remove high mannose and hybrid oligosaccharides, or carried out in the presence of α-methylmannoside in an attempt to saturate ligand-binding sites, resulted in a decrease in the amount of aggregation (data not shown). Combination of endoglycosidase H treatment and working in α-methylmannoside decreased aggregation more than either strategy used separately. These results indicate that Ca2+-induced aggregation is largely due to the presence of terminal sugar residues on one receptor molecule being bound by another receptor molecule, although aggregation could not be completely abolished. Because endoglycosidase H treatment leaves a single GlcNAc residue that could still bind to the mannose receptor, removal of all N-linked oligosaccharides by peptide N glycanase F treatment was attempted. Unfortunately, this treatment resulted in aggregation of receptor fragments under all buffer conditions (data not shown). Because Ca2+-induced aggregation could not be completely eradicated, data obtained in the absence of Ca2+ were used for analysis of the conformation of the receptor. Under physiological conditions, Ca2+ would be boun"

We examined the apoptotic potential of known KILLER/DR5 lung tumor-derived mutants (n = 6) and DD mutants (n = 18) generated based on conservation with DR4, Fas, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). With the exception of Arg-330 required in Fas or FADD for aggregation or for TNFR1 cytotoxicity, surprisingly major loss-of-function KILLER/DR5 alleles (W325A, L334A (lpr-like), I339A, and W360A) contained hydrophobic residues. Loss-of-function of I339A (highly conserved) has not been reported in DDs. Charged residue mutagenesis revealed the following points. 1) E326A, conserved in DR4, is dispensable for death; the homologous residue is positively charged in Fas, TNFR1, and FADD and is critical for DD interactions. 2) K331A, D336A, E338A, K340A, K343A, and D351A have partial loss-of-function suggesting multiple charges stabilize receptor-adapter interactions. Analysis of the tumor-derived KILLER/DR5 mutants revealed the following. 1) L334F has partial loss-of-function versus L334A, whereas E338K has major loss-of-function versus E338A, examples where alanine and tumor-specific substitutions have divergent phenotypes. 2) Unexpectedly, S324F, E326K, K386N, and D407Y have no loss-of-function with tumor-specific or alanine substitutions.

Studies of the C terminus of TNFR1 including deletion and alanine mutagenesis of DD revealed that this domain is critical for apoptotic signaling (34Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Homology studies recognized the presence of a DD within Fas as well (34Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Crystal structure analysis of the Fas DD revealed six anti-parallel α-helices (35Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the Fas DD, as well as similar studies with the pro-apoptotic adapter molecule FADD, revealed the importance of helices 2 and 3 for self-association and protein/protein interactions (35Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 36Jeong E.-J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.-S. Kim K.-S. J. Biol.

Naturally occurring mutants of DD-containing receptors have been described. The lpr cg mouse, which develops an autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder, contains a I238N alteration changing an isoleucine to an asparagine within the DD of the mouse Fas receptor (37Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Itoh N. Yonehara S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). Mutations of DD-containing receptors have also been found in human cancers. Rare loss-of-function alterations were initially described in the TRAIL receptor KILLER/DR5 in head and neck cancer specimens. A single-base insertional mutation led to a frameshift in the DD of KILLER/DR5, leading to premature termination of translation and a resulting DD-truncated functionally deficient receptor (38.). More recently, a number of mutations have been reported in the DD of KILLER/DR5 in non-small cell lung cancers in 11 of 104 (10.6%) specimens tested (39Lee S.H. Shin M.S. Kim H.S. Lee H.K. Park W.S. Kim S.Y. Lee J.H. Han S.Y. Park J.Y. Oh R.R. Jang J.J. Han J.Y. Lee J.Y. Yoo N.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5683-5686PubMed Google Scholar). These alterations included eight missense, one nonsense, one splice site, and one silent change within exons 9 and 10 of the human KILLER/DR5 gene (39Lee S.H. Shin M.S. Kim H.S. Lee H.K. Park W.S. Kim S.Y. Lee J.H. Han S.Y. Park J.Y. Oh R.R. Jang J.J. Han J.Y. Lee J.Y. Yoo N.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5683-5686PubMed Google Scholar). None of the substitution changes were functionally characterized, although three of the eight missense alterations involved a C-to-T transition at base pair 1087 leading to an L334F (leucine to phenylalanine change). Leu-334 is the homologous position to the lpr mutation in the mouse Fas receptor gene. Alteration in cancer of other receptors has been reported and includes homozygous deletion of DR4 in nasopharyngeal cancer (40Ozoren N. Fisher M.J. Kim K. Liu C.X. Genin A. Shifman Y. Dicker D.

Because of their involvement in cancers and the potential therapeutic applications of TRAIL and TRAIL receptor signaling, we undertook a site-directed mutagenesis strategy to identify important aspects of DD transduction of a cell death signal. No detailed mutational analysis or structure-function study has been reported for either of the two pro-apoptotic TRAIL receptors DR4 and KILLER/DR5. Moreover, no detailed comparisons with other TNF receptor family members have been performed in terms of conservation of structural features versusfunctional outcome in death signaling. Thus, the present studies involved the generation of a series of point mutants within human KILLER/DR5 leading to 18 different amino acid substitutions by alanine at positions chosen based on alignments with family members, and information derived from structural evidence with other family members. Finally, we investigated the functional significance of six known DD substitutions isolated from non-small cell lung cancer specimens. Our results provide interesting comparisons into the relative importance of charged versus hydrophobic DD amino acid residues and death signaling. Moreover, we show that one tumor-derived KILLER/DR5 mutant displayed a more severe loss-of-function phenotype, whereas a different tumor-derived mutant displayed a much more modest defect in death signaling as compared with their respective alanine substitutions. Finally, a number of tumor-derived mutants were shown to retain apoptotic capability when overexpressed. The present studies provide novel insights into specific structural determinants within the DD that signal downstream caspase activation by the KILLER/DR5 death receptor protein. The KILLER/DR5 cDNA was cloned in frame into pcDNA3.1-Myc-HisA− (Invitrogen) as an EcoRI/HindIII fragment. This C-terminally tagged Myc-His plasmid was subsequently mutagenized using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Due to the size of the template (6.7 kilobases), certain changes were made to the manufacturer's protocol to yield polymerase chain reaction product: inclusion of 10% glycerol, 5% Me2SO, and 100 ng of template in polymerase chain reaction, decrease of annealing temperature to 50 °C, and 18 cycles of amplification. Mutations were verified by sequencing, and in each case the entire cDNA was checked for the absence of second site mutations. The colon cancer cell line SW480 was maintained and transfected as described previously (13Wu G.S. Burns T.F. McDonald III, E.R. Jiang W. Meng R. Krantz I.D. Kao G. Gan D.-D. Zhou J.-Y. Muschel R. Hamilton S.R. Spinner N.B. Markowitz S. Wu G. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were harvested in 1× Laemmli sample buffer 16 h after transfection. PARP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 1:2000) and Myc (Santa Cruz; 1:500) immunoblots were performed following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce; 1:5000) treatments were followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro translation reactions were carried out using 1 μg of wild-type or mutant KILLER/DR5 plasmid DNA and the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). SW480 cells were transfected with a 1:10 ratio of EGFP-spectrin (43Kalejta R.F. Shenk T. Beavis A.J. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and KILLER/DR5 expression plasmid. Transfections were harvested at 18 h after transfection, processed, and analyzed for the presence of a sub-G1 peak as described previously (40Ozoren N. Fisher M.J. Kim K. Liu C.X. Genin A. Shifman Y. Dicker D. Spinner N.B. Lisitsyn N.A. El-Deiry W.S. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 917-925PubMed Google Scholar). 10,000 GFP-positive cells were analyzed per experiment, and three independent experiments were performed for each mutant. Percentage of apoptosis was calculated by subtracting transfection-induced sub-G1 peak (vector transfection) from each wild-type or mutant KILLER/DR5 sub-G1 peak. Figures for Tables II and III were generated by setting wild-type death to 100% (∼40% sub-G1 peak at 18 h) in order to compare point mutants to the wild-type protein.Table IIApoptosis (sub-G1) induced by point mutants expressed as percentage of wild typeKILLER/DR5 point mutantSub-G1 peakApoptotic ability 2-aWT, able to induce apoptosis as well as wild-type protein; ±, 20–25% reduction in ability to induce apoptosis; −, completely deficient in ability to induce apoptosis.%WT100WTLoss-of-function mutationsW325A44 ± 8.4−R330A−1 ± 1.6−L334A (position equivalent to Fas lpr)28 ± 14.2−I339A5 ± 3.4−W360A−2 ± 2.5−Partial loss-of-function mutationsK331A85 ± 5.2±D336A74 ± 11.1±E338A83 ± 7.6±K340A85 ± 12.4±K343A83 ± 8.6±D351A90 ± 4.1±L377A73 ± 5.0±No loss-of-function mutationsS324A90 ± 12.7WTE326A96 ± 10.6WTN362A98 ± 10.9WTK386A110 ± 7.5WTQ387A110 ± 9.0WTK388A101 ± 11.3WT2-a WT, able to induce apoptosis as well as wild-type protein; ±, 20–25% reduction in ability to induce apoptosis; −, completely deficient in ability to induce apoptosis.

The cells were then trypsinized, spun down, and resuspended in 2 ml of complete medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml His tagged-TRAIL and 1 μg/ml anti-6-histidine antibody (R&D Systems) for 15 min at 37 °C. For untreated samples, only the TRAIL was excluded. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min on ice in TRAIL DISC IP lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). The lysates were cleared twice by centrifugation at 4 °C. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated overnight with 30 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C to isolate the TRAIL DISC. The complexes were subsequently washed four times with TRAIL DISC IP lysis buffer and eluted with Immunopure Gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer (Pierce) with 0.1 m dithiothreitol at room temperature for 2 h. The protein complexes were methanol/chloroform-precipitated and resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Caspase 8 (Cell Signaling; 1:1000) and FADD (Upstate Biotechnology; 1:2000) Western blots were performed to measure recruitment of these endogenous proteins to the TRAIL DISC along with the exogenously expressed KILLER/DR5 (Myc; Santa Cruz) protein. Recent mutational and crystal structure studies with Fas and FADD (35Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 36Jeong E.-J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.-S. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have revealed the importance of helices 2 and 3 of both proteins. Electrostatic interactions between surface residues are thought to mediate DD/DD interactions. DD mutants were designed, based on a number of selection criteria including residue charge, hydrophobicity, conservation, and demonstrated functional significance in other receptor systems. Due to the noted importance of helices 2 and 3 within Fas and FADD, we focused our mutagenesis on charged residues in order to identify residues crucial for receptor/adapter interactions. Fig.1 depicts an amino acid alignment of the death domains of selected members of the TNF superfamily. Eighteen residues within KILLER/DR5, which were targeted for alanine replacement mutagenesis, are noted with an asterisk along with the amino acid position of the short form of the KILLER/DR5 protein. Fig. 2 A shows protein expression of each construct following transfection into SW480 colon cancer cells for 16 h. Most of the alanine mutants expressed protein at levels equivalent to wild type KILLER/DR5. Selected mutants showed an increase in protein expression levels in addition to the appearance of a lower mobility form of the protein. Interestingly, these mutants with higher levels of expression and the larger form appeared to be either partially or completely defective in inducing apoptosis (see data below). This would explain the higher levels of the transfected protein as the cell was able to withstand the presence of these non-toxic proteins. The lower mobility form could also be explained due to the higher levels of transfected protein being made and withstood by the cell. Fig. 2 B compares transfected cell lysates to in vitro translated proteins, which do not undergo processing of the signal peptide. The TNT reactions yield a lower mobility form of KILLER/DR5, which comigrates with the upper band observed in the transfected cell lysates of mutants, W325A and R330A. In addition, cotransfection of the anti-apoptotic gene, FLIPS, along with wild type KILLER/DR5 protects the cells from death and both the processed and unprocessed forms of the wild-type protein can be detected by Western blot analysis (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W1982893604,"FcεRI-induced Ca2+ signaling in mast cells is initiated by activation of cytosolic tyrosine kinases. Here, in vitro phospholipase assays establish that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) lipid product, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, further stimulates phospholipase Cγ2 that has been activated by conformational changes associated with tyrosine phosphorylation or low pH. A microinjection approach is used to directly assess the consequences of inhibiting class IA PI 3-kinases on Ca2+ responses after FcεRI cross-linking in RBL-2H3 cells. Injection of antibodies to the p110β or p110δ catalytic isoforms of PI 3-kinase, but not antibodies to p110α, lengthens the lag time to release of Ca2+ stores and blunts the sustained phase of the calcium response. Ca2+ responses are also inhibited in cells microinjected with recombinant inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase I, which degrades inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), or heparin, a competitive inhibitor of the Ins(1,4,5)P3receptor. This indicates a requirement for Ins(1,4,5)P3 to initiate and sustain Ca2+ responses even when PI 3-kinase is fully active. Antigen-induced cell ruffling, a calcium-independent event, is blocked by injection of p110β and p110δ antibodies, but not by injection of 5-phosphatase I, heparin, or anti-p110α antibodies. These results suggest that the p110β and p110δ isoforms of PI 3-kinase support FcεRI-induced calcium signaling by modulating Ins(1,4,5)P3 production, not by directly regulating the Ca2+ influx channel.

Subsequent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate by PLCγ leads to the formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3, the release of Ca2+ from internal stores (2Streb H. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Schulz I. Nature. 1983; 306: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), and the influx of Ca2+ through store-operated channels (3Zhang L. McCloskey M.A. J. Physiol.

Mendoza G. Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1975; 115: 1599-1602PubMed Google Scholar). This scenario was complicated in recent years by observations that PLCγ activation and Ca2+ responses and secretion are all diminished in mast cells treated with inhibitors of PI 3-kinases (5Yano H.

It was subsequently discovered that full activation of PLCγ proteins in mast cells requires both tyrosine phosphorylation, potentially mediated by Tec family kinases (7Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M.

Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Despite demonstrated roles for PI 3-kinase in the activation of PLCγ, its specific contribution to the temporal regulation of FcεRI-mediated Ca2+ signaling is unresolved. Although wortmannin treatment can slightly increase the lag time leading to the initial rise in calcium after antigen stimulation, it does not block the initial response (10Barker S.A. Lujan D. Wilson B.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The most dramatic effects of wortmannin treatment are on the amplitude and duration of the sustained phase of Ca2+ signaling (10Barker S.A. Lujan D. Wilson B.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One possible interpretation of this result is that tyrosine phosphorylation of the abundant PLCγ2 isoform, which is unaffected by wortmannin treatment, is sufficient stimulus for the initial Ins(1,4,5)P3 production required for rapid release of stores. In this study, we test the hypothesis that full activation of PLCγ, mediated by PI 3-kinase, is particularly important to sustain Ca2+ responses. This is consistent with evidence in RBL-2H3 cells that activation of the store-operated Ca2+ influx current, ICRAC, requires concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 higher than required to initiate store depletion (11Fierro L.

( Lond. ). 2000; 523: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is important to note that several alternative hypotheses could explain previous observations using wortmannin. First, it is conceivable that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3can regulate Ca2+ influx through PLCγ-independent mechanisms. Evidence in T cells suggests that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 can directly activate Ca2+channels (14Hsu A.L. Ching T.T. Sen G. Wang D.S. Bondada S. Authi K.S. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16242-16250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and work in platelets and megakaryocytes implicates the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-sensitive Tec family kinase, Btk (15Pasquet J.M. Quek L. Stevens C. Bobe R. Huber M. Duronio V. Krystal G. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2793-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Second, Choi et al. (16Choi O.H. Kim J.H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) proposed that the second messenger sphingosine-1-phosphate may regulate FcεRI-mediated store release, independent of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production. Third, PI 3-kinase-independent effects of wortmannin have been reported (17Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that other targets of the inhibitor might be responsible for the inhibitory effects on the calcium responses. Intracellular phosphoinositide levels are also regulated by a family of inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (18Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Activation of p150SHIP, a member of this family that removes phosphate from the 5′ position of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and the related inositol phosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5-phosphate 4, down-regulates Ca2+ signaling in RBL cells (19Malbec O. Fong D.C. Turner M. Tybulewicz V.L. Cambier J.C. Fridman W.H. Daeron M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1647-1658PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, bone marrow-derived mast cells from p150SHIP− /−mice show an increase in the amplitude of the Ca2+ response in comparison to bone marrow-derived mast cells from their wild type counterparts (20Huber M. Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Liu L. Humphries R.K. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11330-11335Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Less well characterized is the role of the type I 5-phosphatase that regulates the levels of soluble phosphoinositides by removing phosphate from the 5′ position of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and inositol 1,3,4,5-phosphate 4. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, overexpression of this enzyme causes an oscillatory Ca2+response and blocks sustained increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels after purinergic receptor stimulation (21De Smedt F. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Vanweyenberg V. De Smedt H. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17367-17375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recent work with nonhydrolyzable Ins(1,4,5)P3 analogs suggests that this enzyme may limit activation of the store-operated Ca2+ influx current, ICRAC, in RBL cells (13Glitsch M.D. Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 523: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The type I 5-phosphatase is a potentially useful tool for examining the effect of lowering Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels in cells under conditions in which other phosphoinosotide signaling pathways are fully operational. In addition to regulating Ca2+ signaling, PI 3-kinase activity regulates receptor-induced actin rearrangements in a number of cell types (22Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Johanson S.O. Naccache P.A. Crouch M.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the RBL-2H3 cell line, wortmannin-sensitive PI 3-kinase activity is required for the formation of large, actin-based, plasma membrane ruffles at the cell surface after FcεRI cross-linking (6Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Hall A. Martinez A.M. Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although antigen-stimulated ruffling does not require extracellular Ca2+, it is mimicked by phorbol ester treatment (24Pfeiffer J.R. Seagrave J.C. Davis B.H. Deanin G.G. Oliver J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and is thus potentially dependent on PLCγ activation. In this report, we show that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 enhances the activity of PLCγ2 that has already acquired the “uncapped” active conformation after in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation orin vitro exposure to low pH. Inhibitory antibodies to the class IA PI 3-kinase catalytic subunits, introduced by microinjection into RBL-2H3 cells, provide further proof that PI 3-kinases mediate the wortmannin-sensitive steps leading to Ca2+ signaling and membrane ruffling in antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. Consistent with recent evidence that the p110 subunits can have functionally distinct roles in intracellular signaling (22Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Hooshmand-Rad R. Hajkova L. Klint P. Karlsson R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 207-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hill K. Welti S., Yu, J. Murray J.T. Yip S.C. Condeelis J.S. Segall J.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3741-3744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we find that antibodies to p110β and p110δ, but not to p110α, affect these two specific antigen-stimulated responses, despite the fact that all three subunits associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins after receptor stimulation. Finally, we compare inhibition of Ca2+signaling in cells injected with PI 3-kinase-inhibitory antibodies to that in cells microinjected with heparin, which blocks binding of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to its receptor (27Hill T.D. Berggren P.O. Boynton A.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), or with recombinant inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase I, which hydrolyzes Ins(1,4,5)P3. The results show that FcεRI-mediated calcium responses are absolutely dependent on Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated gating of its receptors on intracellular stores. They are consistent with a model in which PI 3-kinase lipid products support maximal production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 required for store depletion and do not provide a PLCγ-independent means to activate calcium influx in RBL-2H3 cells. Isoform-specific inhibitory antibodies to the carboxyl termini of the p110α and p110β catalytic subunits of class IA PI 3-kinase (26Hill K. Welti S., Yu, J. Murray J.T. Yip S.C. Condeelis J.S. Segall J.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3741-3744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were prepared as a 2.5 mg/ml solution in PBS. Commercial antibodies to the carboxyl terminus of the p110δ subunit (residues 1030–1044; PharMingen, San Diego, CA) were dialyzed against 0.1× PBS to remove azide and concentrated by freeze drying and resuspension at 2.5 mg/ml in double-distilled H20. For experiments in which p110β and p110δ antibodies were coinjected, freeze-dried p110δ was resuspended in a solution of p110β to yield a preparation containing 2.5 mg/ml of each antibody. Low molecular weight heparin (∼3000 average molecular weight; Sigma) was injected as a 25 mg/ml solution in PBS. Fura-2 pentapotassium salt (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to injection solutions to a final concentration of 5 mm. For immunoprecipitation-based assays, RBL-2H3 cells were cultured on tissue culture-grade plastic in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (HyClone), penicillin-streptomycin, and l-glutamine. For microinjection experiments, cells were plated overnight onto glass coverslips mounted in Teflon dishes. In all cases, IgE receptors were primed with anti-DNP-IgE (1 μg/ml) for 12–20 h. Cells were washed to remove excess IgE and activated at 37 °C by the addition of polyvalent antigen (0.1 μg/ml DNP-BSA). Phospholipase activity was measured as described previously (10Barker S.A. Lujan D. Wilson B.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), except that EGTA was omitted from reaction buffers in experiments where pH was varied. Adherent cells (107 cells/sample) were stimulated with antigen, washed with cold PBS, and scraped from plates into 1 ml of lysis buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Brij 96, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitor mixture from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN)). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 5 min and rocked for 2 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose bead mixture (1:1) (Pharmacia) prebound to 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-p85 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) or p110 isoform-specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in buffer C, solubilized by heating to 95 °C for 5 min in 1× Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% immunoglobulin-free BSA (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated PY20 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Membranes were washed and incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence development substrate (Pierce). Blots were then stripped and reprobed with polyclonal p85 antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence development. The cDNA encoding murine Mr 45,000 5-phosphatase was subcloned into the pTrcHis expression plasmid (Invitrogen). His-tagged 5-phosphatase fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purified on Ni-NTAG-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified protein was dialyzed against phosphate buffer, yielding a preparation for microinjection containing 0.35 mg/ml (determined by the Bio-Rad Coomassie Blue protein assay kit) and a single prominent band of Mr 51,000 by SDS-PAGE. Phosphatase activity was confirmed in vitro, as described by Ono et al. (28Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Microinjection was performed at room temperature with an Eppendorf semiautomated microinjector and micromanipulator (Eppendorf, Madison, WI) mounted on a Zeiss IM35 microscope equipped with a CO2 perfusion system. Injection needles were pulled with a vertical pipette puller (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). Cells were allowed to recover for 30 min at room temperature after microinjection, before warming to 37 °C and the addition of antigen. Cells judged to contain morphological abnormalities after the recovery period were excluded from further analysis. As described above, cells were microinjected with 5 mm solutions of fura-2-free acid plus or minus inhibitory reagents. After recovery, ratio imaging was performed at 37 °C on a Zeiss IM35 microscope equipped with a stage heater and a CO2 perfusion system (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY), a Ludl filter wheel, and a Dage-MTI intensified video charge-coupled device camera interfaced to Simca imaging software (Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Responses were measured from groups of three to eight injected cells, in a single field of view, per experiment. All Ca2+ experiments were performed in Hank's balanced salt solution. Calibration of background-corrected ratio values (350 nm/380 nm) against standard solutions in vitro was done as described previously (29Lee R.J. Oliver J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 825-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Analysis of data and graphing were performed with Graphpad Prism software. Microinjected, IgE-primed cells were activated for 10 min with 100 ng/ml DNP-BSA and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by sequential staining with 1 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (to identify injected cells; Cappell, Westchester, PA) and rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in PBS with 0.1% BSA. Cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA) and viewed on a Zeiss IM35 microscope. Images were captured with a Photometrics CH250 cooled charge-coupled device camera interfaced to Compix imaging software. Figures were assembled with Adobe Photoshop software. To confirm and extend our previous results demonstrating enhancement of PLCγ activity by the inclusion of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in lipid micelle substrates (8Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Pfeiffer J.R. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we have investigated the effect of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 on PLCγ2 activated in vivo by receptor stimulation andin vitro by pH-dependent conformational change. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 A,PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is a weak stimulator of nonphosphorylated PLCγ2 that has been immunoprecipitated from resting RBL-2H3 cells. However, even small amounts of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 markedly increase the activity of PLCγ2 that was tyrosine-phosphorylated after FcεRI cross-linking and immunoprecipitated from activated cells. Based on recent models that propose “uncapping” as the means by which either tyrosine phosphorylation or low pH activates PLCγ (30Zhou C. Horstman D. Carpenter G. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2786-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we next tested the effect of adding PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to phospholipase reactions conducted at pH 5. Results in Fig.1 B show that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 also augments PLCγ2 activated by low pH and suggest that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 activates PLCγ2 by a mechanism distinct from uncapping. Results in Fig. 1 confirm a role for PI 3-kinase lipid products in the direct activation of PLCγ but do not identify the specific form of PI 3-kinase involved in FcεRI signaling. Because RBL-2H3 cells express all three catalytic p110 isoforms of class IA PI 3-kinase, commercial isoform-specific antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate PI 3-kinase heterodimers from resting and antigen-stimulated cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated with these immune complexes were identified after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig.2 A, all three PI 3-kinases isolated from resting cells associate with a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein migrating at an approximate molecular weight of 100,000. Within 2 and 5 min after stimulation, new tyrosine-phosphorylated species appear at Mr∼85,000, Mr 42,000, andMr 27,000. The profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is similar but not identical in p85 immunoprecipitates. Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-p85 antibodies (Fig. 2 B). The amount of p85 precipitated with anti-p110α antibodies was consistently less than that precipitated with the other two isoform-specific antibodies, suggesting that p110α is the least abundant isoform in RBL-2H3 cells. Several reports have described effective inhibition of catalytic activity by antibodies raised to specific sequences in the carboxyl termini of p110α, p110β, and p100δ (22Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 26Hill K. Welti S., Yu, J. Murray J.T. Yip S.C. Condeelis J.S. Segall J.E. Backer J.M. J.

Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We introduced anti-carboxyl-terminal inhibitory antibodies into RBL-2H3 cells to identify the class IA PI 3-kinase p110 isoforms that regulate Ca2+ signaling after FcεRI cross-linking. Inhibitory antibodies to p110α and p110β used here have been described previously (22Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 26Hill K. Welti S., Yu, J. Murray J.T. Yip S.C. Condeelis J.S. Segall J.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3741-3744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Antibodies to p110δ, which were raised against the same peptide as antibodies used to inhibit p110δ in other studies (31Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E. Allen W.E. Zicha D. Hooshmand-Rad R. Sawyer C. Wells C. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), were demonstrated to inhibit p110δ activity in vitro(data not shown). Fig. 3,A—E, shows representative traces from control cells (Fig.3 A, cells injected with fura-2 alone) compared with cells microinjected with the isoform-specific, anti-p110 antibodies (Fig. 3,B–E). Whereas the blocking antibodies to p110α have no significant effect on the overall Ca2+ response (Fig.3 B), the presence of either p110β (Fig. 3 C) or p110δ (Fig. 3 D) blocking antibodies results in diminished Ca2+ responses, including a delayed onset after stimulus, a blunted sustained phase and oscillations. Injection of the combination of both p110β and p110δ antibodies dramatically reduces antigen-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization, resulting in a weak, transient response (Fig. 3 E). Fig. 3 F reports the average area under the curve for multiple experiments, where Ca2+ i is plotted against time after activation. Coverslips containing antibody-injected cells were fixed immediately after Ca2+ imaging had been performed. To determine the effects of the microinjected antibodies on plasma membrane ruffling, cells were permeabilized by a brief detergent treatment and stained with rhodamine phalloidin (which labels filamentous actin in all cells) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (which identifies injected cells). Fluorescence micrographs in Fig.4 show that antibodies to p110β and p110δ both inhibited the formation of actin-based plasma membrane ruffles in activated cells, whereas antibodies to p110α had little or no effect. Injection of inhibitory antibodies did not prevent the formation of actin plaques on the ventral surface of activated cells (data not shown), in agreement with results obtained using the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (6Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Hall A. Martinez A.M. Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To investigate the Ins(1,4,5)P3 dependence of antigen-stimulated calcium responses, RBL-2H3 cells were microinjected with recombinant inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase I. The 5-phosphatase was produced as a His-tagged protein in E. coli and purified by nickel chromatography. The purity of the enzyme was greater than 90%, based on analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels, and inositol 5-phosphatase activity was confirmed using [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakis-phosphate as a substrate (data not shown). Representative traces of Ca2+ responses after FcεRI cross-linking in control-injected and 5-phosphatase I-injected cells are shown in Fig.5, A and B. These results demonstrate that high levels of 5-phosphatase inhibit the sustained phase of FcεRI-induced Ca2+ signaling, resulting in a single initial spike of calcium release (Fig.5 B). The overall magnitude of the Ca2+ response in 5-phosphatase-injected cells was significantly inhibited compared with the response of control cells (Fig. 5 C). The inhibition of Ca2+ responses caused by 5-phosphatase injection was similar to that seen by injection of inhibitory antibodies to p110β and p110δ (Fig. 3). However, direct observation of injected cells after Ca2+ imaging revealed that 5-phosphatase injection did not affect the plasma membrane ruffling response (data not shown). Heparin is a competitive inhibitor of the Ins(1,4,5)P3receptor that blocks Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated store release (27Hill T.D. Berggren P.O. Boynton A.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ca2+ responses in heparin-microinjected RBL-2H3 cells were either completely ablated (Fig.6 B, top panel) or reduced to a single initial spike (Fig. 6 B, bottom panels), presumably reflecting a brief pulse of intracellular store release. In this series of experiments, complete inhibition of the Ca2+ signal was seen in ∼30% of heparin-injected cells. The SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin was added 10 min after stimulation with antigen to passively deplete internal stores and rule out possible direct effects of heparin on the store-operated influx pathway. Thapsigargin induced a sustained Ca2+ response in heparin-injected cells, demonstrating that the store-operated pathway was functionally intact and apparently ruling out any direct role for binding of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to its receptor in the store-operated influx pathway. Thapsigargin induced a secondary response in antigen-stimulated control cells, suggesting that some refilling of internal Ca2+ stores can occur during continuous antigen stimulation. Direct observation of injected cells after Ca2+ imaging revealed that heparin did not affect the ruffling response induced by FcεRI cross-linking, even in cells displaying no Ca2+ response (data not shown). These results demonstrate that neither heparin nor 5-phosphatase I interferes with global events downstream of PI 3-kinase and support earlier observations that membrane ruffling is not dependent on elevations in intracellular Ca2+ (24Pfeiffer J.R. Seagrave J.C. Davis B.H. Deanin G.G. Oliver J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ isoforms was first demonstrated to occur downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor activation (32Wahl M.I. Jones G.A. Nishibe S. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10447-10456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led to a simple model for PLCγ activation downstream of tyrosine kinase signaling cascades and, in the FcεRI system, w"

Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In accordance with this model, CTD or CTD fragments including p53(361–382) can displace CTD from its binding site within the central domain, resulting in a change in p53 conformation and activation of p53 binding to DNA (4Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The CTD fragments can bind to the isolated core domain in vitro (5Selivanova G. Ryabchenko L.

Activation of latent p53 by peptides derived from CTD has been reported to be sequence-specific because neither mutant p53(361–382) peptides nor peptides derived from the N-terminal p53 domain activate p53 or demonstrate only weak activity (4Hupp T.R.

Med. 1997; 3: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). CTD also shows target specificity because it did not influence the interaction of SRF and GAL4-VP16 proteins with DNA (8Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The overlap of the regulatory region in CTD, which is rich in basic amino acids, with the second DNA-binding site in the p53 molecule is the key feature of the steric model (9Bayle J.H. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Anderson M.E. Woelker B. Reed M. Wang P. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6255-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This model postulates that p53 binds to genomic DNA via CTD, and this binding prevents the interaction of the core domain with target sequences in gene promoters. The steric model is supported by the fact that long nonspecific DNA molecules inhibit sequence-specific binding of the full-length p53 to DNA but shows no effect on p53 with deletion of the CTD regulatory sequence (9Bayle J.H. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Anderson M.E. Woelker B. Reed M. Wang P. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell.

To gain insight into the mechanism of p53 latency, the sequence and target specificity of p53 activation by CTD fragments and the interactions of activating peptides with p53 and DNA were characterized. A conventional band shift assay was used to characterize p53 binding to DNA, whereas fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was applied to follow the interactions of activating peptides with p53 and DNA. The high sensitivity of FCS (Fig.1 and Refs. 11Eigen M. Rigler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5740-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 12Rigler R. J.

DNA molecules unexpectedly formed aggregates in the presence of the CTD fragment and other activating peptides. Our findings suggest that p53 is activated for binding to target DNA sites when it interacts with juxtaposed DNA molecules in DNA aggregates via both its core and CTD. Thus, CTD, when it binds to DNA, may prevent the interaction of the core domain of the full-length p53 with target but not with nontarget DNA sequences. This hypothesis seems to unify the previously postulated steric and allosteric models. The plasmid encoding human wild type p53, GST-human wild type p53 fusion protein, the deletion fusion proteins GST-p53(1–100), GST-p53(99–307), GST-p53(320–393), and GST-p53Δ30, the mutant fusion proteins GST-p53His273 and GST-p53Trp248 have been described elsewhere (5Selivanova G.

BD with the C-terminal Cys-amide extension was synthesized and labeled with tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes Europe BV) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Rh-BD was isolated on an analytical Nucleosil 120–3 C18 reverse phase HPLC column (Macherey-Nagel) and lyophilized, and the powder was weighed and used for preparation of solutions. The identity of the purified labeled peptide was confirmed by plasma desorption mass spectrometry. The purity of the peptide was > 90%. 5-Carboxytetramethylrhodamine (Rh′)-labeled ((+)-strands) and unlabeled ((−)-strands), HPLC-purified DNA 50-mer oligonucleotides were purchased from TIB-MOLBIOL (Berlin, Germany). The oligonucleotides represent the wild type and mutant BC 30-mer oligonucleotides, extended from 5′ and 3′ ends, and contain six adjacent consensus pentamer wild type or mutant (mutant nucleotides are shown in italic type) p53 binding sites (underlined; the sequences for the (+)-strands are shown): Rh′-5′-AGTCGTCGACCGGGCATGTCCGGGCATGTCCGGGCATGTCCCGTACTAGG-3′ (ss-Rh′-SO) and Rh′-5′-AGTCGTCGACCGCGTACTGTGGGCGATCGGCGACACGTCTCCGTACTAGG-3′ (ss-Rh′-NO), respectively. Concentrations of fluorescent single-stranded oligonucleotides were determined from their absorbance at 260 nm using the extinction coefficients calculated from nucleotide composition after subtraction of the absorbance of 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine at this wavelength. Contribution of 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine to the absorbance at 260 nm was calculated from the spectrum of this dye and from the absorbance of fluorescent oligonucleotides at 546 nm. Concentrations of fluorescent peptide and oligonucleotides, as well as the presence of free dye were verified by measuring the rhodamine absorbance at 546 nm and by FCS with 1 nm rhodamine standard solution prepared by weighing. At 1 nmconcentration of a standard rhodamine solution and solutions of fluorescent peptides and oligonucleotides, 0.2 fl confocal volume of measurement contains in average one molecule of fluorescent dye that was detected by FCS. Free dye in solutions did not exceed 10% of fluorescently labeled compounds. FCS was performed with confocal illumination of a volume element of 0.2 fl in a ConfoCor® instrument (Carl Zeiss-Evotec, Jena, Germany; Fig. 1) as described previously (21Rigler R. Mets Ü.

As focusing optics a Zeiss Neofluar 40× numerical aperture 1.2 objective for water immersion was used in an epiillumination setup. Separation of exciting from emitted radiation was achieved by dichroic (Omega 540 DRL PO2; Omega Optical, Blattleboro, VT) and bandpass (Omega 565 DR 50) filters. The Rh-BD and Rh′-oligonucleotides were excited with the 514.5-nm line of an argon laser. The intensity fluctuations were detected by an avalanche photodiode (SPCM 200; EG & G, Quebec, Canada) and processed with a digital correlator (ALV 5000, ALV, Langen, Germany).

Fluorescent probes Rh-BD, Rh′-SO, or Rh′-NO were incubated at 2 nm concentrations in the absence or the presence of p53 proteins, peptides, or other compounds in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100) used for p53-DNA binding studies at 20 °C, and droplets (10 μl) of the samples were analyzed by FCS for 1 up to 3 min. Bovine serum albumin (1 μg/μl) was included when Rh′-SO and Rh′-NO oligonucleotides were used as fluorescent probes. Measurements were performed in triplicate 2–5, 10–20, and 30–40 min after the initiation of the reaction. Practically identical results were obtained at these time points. Anti-YY1 C20 antibody with blocking peptide and anti-p50 antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA), anti-p53 PAb421 antibody was from Oncogene Science Inc. (Unlondale, NY). Sequence specificity of peptide effects on p53 binding to DNA was studied in a band shift assay. As previously described (18Selivanova G. Iotsova V. Kiseleva E. Strom M. Bakalkin G. Grafstrom R.C. Wiman K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3560-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the GST-wild type p53 protein remained latent in the absence of any DNA competitor (Fig. 2, lane 1). p53 binding to the consensus p53-binding site, BC, was activated by PAb421 antibody (lane 2), and by the p53(361–382) fragment (lane 3). p53(361–382) is a basic peptide, which suggests that other basic peptides may also activate p53. Three model basic peptides with irregular alternation of basic residues, the 32-amino acid fragment of prodynorphin (human prodynorphin 207–238 or BD) and two of its constituent fragments, dynorphin A (17 amino acids) and B (13 amino acids), as well as penta-l-lysine and poly-l-lysine with a size up to 5 kDa, were tested for effects on p53 binding to DNA. Both BD and poly-l-lysine strongly activated p53 (lanes 4, 15, and16), whereas dynorphins A and B produced practically no activation (lanes 5 and 6). No activation was observed with penta-l-lysine at ∼30-fold higher molar concentration (lanes 12 and 13) or a mixture of dynorphins A and B at a concentration equimolar with BD (lane 7). No stable complexes were seen when radiolabeled DNA was incubated with these peptides alone (lane 11 and data not shown). Complex formation activated by BD was inhibited by unlabeled BC oligonucleotide (lane 9) but not by unlabeled oligonucleotide MN lacking p53 binding site (lane 10; Ref.18Selivanova G. Iotsova V. Kiseleva E. Strom M. Bakalkin G. Grafstrom R.C. Wiman K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3560-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the peptide activated sequence-specific interaction with DNA. p53-labeled BC complex formation was activated by basic peptides in the absence of any competitor DNA (lanes 3and 4) or in the presence of poly(dI-dC) (lanes 8, 10, 15, and 16). To test whether p53(361–382) and BD can target transcription factors other than p53, their effects on the DNA binding activity of AP-1, NF-κB, YY1, and protein Ku were studied in nuclear extracts of SH-SY5Y cells. Only the DNA binding activity of YY1, a multifunctional transcription regulator, was activated by the two peptides (data not shown). Experiments were repeated with affinity purified YY1, and DNA binding was strongly (10–50-fold) activated by p53(361–382) and BD (Fig.3 A, lines 1–6) with half-maximum effects observed at 5–10 nmconcentrations (data not shown). Activated YY1 retained its sequence specificity because an oligonucleotide with wild type but not mutant binding site inhibited binding (lanes 7–9). C20 anti-YY1 antibodies supershifted the protein-DNA complex activated by p53(361–382), showing that YY1 is present in the complex (lane 13), whereas other antibodies or C20 antibodies preincubated with a blocking peptide (lanes 11 and 12) failed to inhibit YY1 activation. To determine whether the basic segment within the p53 protein is able to activate YY1, the effects of the full-length p53 and p53 domains on the YY1 DNA binding activity were compared. GST-wild type p53 at a low concentration (0.7 nm) substantially (20–50-fold) stimulated specific DNA binding of purified YY1 (Fig. 3 B,lane 6). GST-CTD, GST-p53His273, and GST-p53Trp248 fusion proteins also enhanced DNA binding activity of YY1 (lanes 8,10, and 11). The lower band apparently represented the truncated YY1-DNA complex. Myoglobin, casein, RNase, polynucleotide kinase, bovine serum albumin, GST-retinoblastoma, and GST-EBNA5 fusion proteins used as controls at 15 nmconcentration failed to modify YY1-DNA binding (data not shown). GST protein alone, GST-p53-N-terminal domain (NTD), and core domains and the GST-p53 deletion mutant lacking the 30 C-terminal amino acids failed to activate YY1 (lanes 2–5). Thus, activation is associated with CTD. To map the sequence of activation in closer details, eight partly overlapping 22-mer peptides spanning most of the C-terminal domain (residues 337–393) were examined. Only the most basic CTD fragment, p53(361–382) retained the ability to strongly activate YY1 (Fig. 3 C, lane 6). The basic CTD segment in latent p53 appears to be available for intermolecular interaction with YY1 or YY1-target oligonucleotides but, paradoxically, does not activate p53 itself (Fig. 2, lane 1). Basic peptides may activate p53 by interacting with the p53 protein, with target DNA or with both molecules. Multiple peptide-protein and peptide-DNA interactions including formation of complexes of weakly interacting molecules at their nanomolar concentrations cannot be readily analyzed by conventional biochemical methods. FCS, a new highly sensitive biophysical technique, allows the analysis of weak interactions and intermolecular complex formation without preceding separation of a fluorescently labeled probe from labeled complexes (Fig. 1 and Refs. 11Eigen M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8671-8681Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the first set of experiments, interactions of the tetramethyl rhodamine-labeled basic peptide, BD (Rh-BD) as a fluorescent probe with the p53 protein and target DNA were studied by FCS. BD, but not p53(361–382), was chosen to distinguish the interactions relevant for the p53 activation from those in which p53(361–382) may be also involved as a fragment of the p53 molecule. Rh-BD was incubated alone or with either GST-p53 or target oligonucleotide ds-SO. Aliquots of the incubation mixture were analyzed by FCS after 2–5, 10–20, and 30–40 min. The fluctuations (changes) of the fluorescence intensity of fluorophore-labeled BD molecules, excited by a focused laser beam, were registered (Figs. 1 and 4 A). These fluctuations reflected a change in the number of Rh-BD molecules in the volume of measurement and were expressed in kHz. At 2 nm concentration of fluorophore, an average of two fluorescent molecules are present in the volume. The fluorescence intensity is increased when new fluorescent molecules diffuse into the volume and decreased when some molecules diffuse out of the volume. From the intensity autocorrelation function (EquationsEquation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3) of the fluorescence intensity fluctuations, the diffusion time of molecules (τD) through the confocal volume is determined, which allows calculations of the molecular weight. Formation of complexes of fluorophore with other molecules in the reaction medium or aggregation of the fluorophore molecules result in an increase of molecular weight of fluorescent complexes and, consequently, their diffusion time (τD). From the correlation function,G(τ) (Equation 3) diffusion times and proportions (weight factors, y) of different fluorescent components in the reaction mixture were evaluated. Fluorescence intensity fluctuations and autocorrelation functions of 2 nm Rh-BD alone and in the presence of GST-p53 fusion protein and DNA are presented in Fig. 4. Rh-BD (control) exhibited typical fluctuations (Fig. 4 A) and a diffusion time (τD) of 0.175 ms (Fig. 4 C, curve 1). GST-p53 in the concentration range from 6 to 37 nm(Fig. 4 C, curve 2, and data not shown) did not have any effect on the diffusion time of Rh-BD. Addition of 1 nm double-stranded specific (ds-SO; Fig. 4 B) or double-stranded nonspecific (data not shown) oligonucleotide containing wild type or mutant p53 consensus sequences, respectively, as well as 0.24 nm of plasmid DNA (data not shown), to the reaction mixture with Rh-BD resulted in an increase and a broadening of the fluctuation peaks. The fluorescence intensity fluctuations exhibited several peaks with strongly increased heights (Fig. 4 B). These peaks, with up to five times higher intensity than the base line, are a clear representation of the Brownian motion of peptide-DNA aggregates containing several tetramethyl rhodamine-labeled BD molecules. The analysis of the autocorrelation of intensity fluctuations showed the presence of two fluorescent components in the reaction mixture characterized by diffusion times of τD1 = 0.175 ms and τD2 = 3899 ms, respectively, and corresponding weight factors (fractions) of y1 = 0.35 andy2 = 0.65 (Fig. 4 C, curve 3). The appearance of the second component with longer diffusion time reflected the formation of large Rh-BD-DNA aggregates. From the diffusion times 0.2 and 4 s, the hydrodynamic radii of equivalent spheres were calculated (14Tjernberg L. Pramanik A. Björling S. Thyberg P. Thyberg J. Nordstedt C. Terenius L. Rigler R.

The three-dimensional structure of aggregates is unclear, and, therefore, calculations assuming other shapes than a sphere were not performed. Practically identical results were obtained at different time points after the initiation of the reaction. Thus, at nanomolar concentrations of basic peptide, protein, and DNA, Rh-BD di"

When microsome fraction obtained from the transfected cells, but not from mock-transfected cells, was incorporated into the lipid bilayer, an anion channel activity was detected. Unitary conductance was 70 picosiemens in symmetric 150 mm KCl solution. We designated this gene Mid-1-related chloride channel (MCLC). MCLC encodes a new class of chloride channel expressed in intracellular compartments.AB052922AB052915 chloride intracellular channel Mid-1-related chloride channel expressed sequence tag polymerase chain reaction 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Chinese hamster ovary endoplasmic reticulum Various types of chloride channels modulate diverse cellular functions. Chloride channels expressed on the plasma membrane regulate various cellular functions including control of cell volume, transepithelial ion transport, modulation of membrane potential, neurotransmission, and bone resorption (1Jentsch T.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Chloride channels are also expressed in intracellular membranes and may regulate acidification of intracellular compartments and vesicle trafficking (2Al-Awqati Q. Curr. Biol. 1995; 7: 504-508Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mutations in the chloride channel genes cause various human diseases such as cystic fibrosis (3Riordan J. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.S. Alon N.

Recently, the molecular nature of chloride channels was revealed by gene cloning, and the functions of chloride channels have been extensively studied at the molecular level. Four major types of chloride channels have been identified to date: the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (6Welsch M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar), the ligand-gated receptor channels (7Hosie A.M. Aronstein K.S. Sattelle D.B. Constant R.A. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 578-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the ClC family (8Jentsch T.J. Gunther W. Pusch M. Schwappach B. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 482: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and the CLIC1 family (9Edwards J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 276: F398-F408Google Scholar). Among them, members of the CLIC family and some of the ClC family are expressed in intracellular organelles, including endoplasmic reticulum, the nuclear envelope, and endosomes, and regulate ion fluxes across the intracellular membranes. The MID-1 gene of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae(10Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) was originally identified as a gene mutation that induces cell death during the treatment of yeast with the mating pheromone. Loss-of-function mutation in the MID-1 gene results in the reduction of calcium entry into the yeast and thereby induces cell death (10Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of the gene product of MID-1(Mid-1) revealed that the Mid-1 was a stretch-activated calcium-permeable cation channel (11Kanzaki M. Nagasawa M. Kojima I. Sato C. Naruse K. Sokabe M. Iida H. Science. 1996; 285: 882-886Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar); Mid-1 functions as a non-selective calcium-permeable channel, the opening of which is regulated by stretch of the plasma membrane. Mid-1 is the first eukaryotic stretch-activated channel whose primary structure was identified by molecular cloning (11Kanzaki M. Nagasawa M. Kojima I. Sato C. Naruse K. Sokabe M. Iida H. Science. 1996; 285: 882-886Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Because stretch-activated channels regulate diverse cellular functions in mammalian cells (12French A.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 135-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we attempted to identify mammalian stretch-activated channels using Mid-1 as a molecular probe. During the course of the present study, we identified a new class of ion channel molecule expressed in intracellular compartments. This protein functions as a chloride channel when incorporated in the planar lipid bilayer and, therefore, we designated it the Mid-1-related chloride channel (MCLC). A BLAST search using the partial sequence of Mid-1 led to the identification of aXenopus unknown transmembrane protein (GenBankTMaccession number X92871). To obtain mammalian homologues, the total sequence of X92871 was used to search again, and this led to the identification of an expressed sequence tag (EST accession numberH51262). A rat brain oligo(dT)-primed λZAP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) cDNA library was screened using cDNA probes derived fromH51262. Replicate filters were prehybridized for 3 h at 37 °C in the following solution: 5× SSPE (standard saline phosphate-EDTA solution), 10× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. The filters were then hybridized in the same solution plus 5 × 105 cpm32P-labeled randomly primed probe (Ready to Go DNA labeling kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The hybridized filters were washed three times at room temperature with 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS and then washed for 1 h at 42 °C with the same buffer. The cDNA was excised from the λZAP vector with the use of a helper phage according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The entire sequence of both strands was determined using an ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing FS ready reaction kit and an Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer 373S (Applied Biosystems, Cambridge, MA). A BLAST search using the total sequence of rat MCLC led to the identification of expressed sequence tags of the human homologue of MCLC (EST accession numbers AA375206, AA906589, and AB018304). The cDNA template was synthesized from MCF7 and HepG2 cells using a gene-specific primer (5′-ATTCAACAACAGTTGCATGTCGCCTT), and a 5′ end-specific forward primer (5′-CCTTATACAGGATGCTGTGTTCTTTG) and a 3′ end-specific reverse primer (5′-GCTGGTGTTCCTCTAGCCACA) were utilized for the amplification of cDNA. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced as described above. The rat cDNA clone was subcloned into the BamHI andXhoI sites of the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). To introduce the FLAG epitope tag into the carboxyl terminus ofMCLC, we amplified a fragment of MCLC (nucleotides 1128–1623) by PCR using the sense primer (5′-AGATGACAGAAGACGACAGAAGGAACTTG) and the antisense primer (5′-TTATTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGCCACACGGGCTGCTGACAAG); the PCR products were then exchanged for native MCLC cDNA. The PCR was carried out using high fidelity enzyme Ultima (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the PCR-generated constructs were verified by sequencing the amplified region. The MCLC expression vectors were purified using a concert high purity plasmid maxiprep system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). To establish stable cell lines, the cells were replaced at a lower concentration in fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 24 h after transfection. 48 h after transfection, the transfected cells were selected using 1 mg/ml neomycin analog G418. After 10–14 days, independent colonies were picked up, grown in 35-mm dishes, and screened for a high level of expression of MCLC and monoclonality by immunostaining. RNA from various tissues was isolated using a TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 40 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel containing 2.2m formaldehyde, 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a capillary blotting technique with 20× SSC (sodium citrate buffer). Northern blots were performed as described elsewhere (15Kanzaki M. Mashima H. Zhang Y.Q. Lu L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells provided by the Riken cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan) were cultured in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) under humidified conditions of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. A10, MCF-7, and HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For the preparation of microsomes, transfected CHO cells and various rat tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 komberg international units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 2 min. The supernatant was taken and centrifuged for 20 min at 8000 × g. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain microsomes. A polyclonal antibody against rat MCLC was raised by immunizing rabbits with peptide (C)RALEPDDRRRQKEL conjugated with keyhole limpect hemocyanine. The MCLC peptide was synthesized and purified to 90–95% homogeneity with high pressure liquid chromatography. The MCLC antiserum was purified with a SulfoLink coupling gel column (Pierce) coupled with the same peptide, according to the manufacturer's instruction. Immunoblotting was performed as described elsewhere (15Kanzaki M. Mashima H. Zhang Y.Q. Lu L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). For immunostaining, cells were grown on coverslips, fixed for 5 min in 3% paraform/phosphate-buffered saline, washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and two times with 50 mm glycine/phosphate-buffered saline, then blocked with Blocking Ace (Snow Brand, Tokyo, Japan), and incubated with anti-MCLC anti-rabbit IgG antibody or anti-FLAG M2 antibody at room temperature for 1 h. For colocalization experiments, MCLC-expressing cells were transfected with PEYFP-ER vector (CLONTECH), and anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody was used. Anti-calnexin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-Golgi 58K antibody (Sigma) was used in other experiments. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were incubated with secondary antibodies obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA) conjugated with indocarbocyanine (Cy3), fluorescein isothiocyanate, or tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (15Kanzaki M. Mashima H. Zhang Y.Q. Lu L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Various rat tissues were excised. 4-μm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the sections in 0.3% hydrogen peroxidase in methanol for 30 min and boiling in 10 mm citrate buffer for 5 min. Immunostaining was performed using VECTASTAIN ABC kits (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The planar lipid bilayer was formed by the method of Montal and Mueller (13Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). A small droplet of the phospholipid solution was taken up into a 10-μl glass capillary pipette. After the inside of the capillary had been coated with the lipid, a bilayer was formed by applying an air bubble from the capillary pipette to the aperture (diameter, 150–240 μm) of a Teflon septum mounted vertically between the two halves of a Teflon chamber. The aperture was pretreated with a solution of 1% n-hexadecane in n-hexane before forming the membrane. The solution in each compartment was connected to an Ag-AgCl electrode via a saturated KCl-agar salt bridge for current measurements under voltage clamp conditions. A 20-μl phospholipid solution (a 7:3 (w:w) mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine, 10 mg/ml in n-hexane) was placed on the surface of 0.5 ml of a 10 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) containing appropriate salts in each compartment. A few minutes later, the solvent had evaporated, and a lipid monolayer was formed at the air/water interface. Phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The lipid bilayer separated the cis solution from thetrans solution (1.5 ml each). The cis andtrans solutions contained initially 150 and 5 mmKCl, respectively, both in 10 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0). Ion channels were incorporated into the bilayer by flushing 9 μl of the microsome suspension (containing 0.5 to ∼1 μg of protein) directly toward the bilayer from the cis side. The solution on the cis and trans sides of the bilayer were connected to a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7, List, Darmstadt, Germany) via 0.5 m KCl-agar bridges in series with Ag-AgCl electrodes. To shield from electromagnetic and mechanical interference, the bilayer chamber and the head stage of the patch clamp amplifier were placed in a Faraday cage mounted on an antivibration table. The electrical current across the bilayer was through an 8-pole low pass Bessel filter and was visualized on a storage oscilloscope. The unfiltered single channel current was stored via a pulse code modulator on a commercial videocassette recorder. Analysis of channel activity was performed with program pCLAMP (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) on a personal computer. Measurements recorded on the videocassette recorder were filtered at 500 Hz and digitized at a frequency of 2,000 Hz, using an analog-to-digital converter. At each holding voltage, channel activity for 30 s was analyzed. A BLAST search using the partial sequence of Mid-1 led to the identification of a Xenopus unknown transmembrane protein (GenBankTM accession number X92871). To obtain a mammalian homologue, the total sequence of X92871 was used to search again, and this led to the identification of an expressed sequence tag (EST accession number H51262). A rat brain cDNA library was screened using the cDNA probe derived from H51262. The full-length rat MCLC cDNA was obtained and sequenced (Fig. 1 A). The ratMCLC cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1623 base pairs and coded for a protein of 541 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 61 kDa. There was no overall sequence similarity between MID-1 and MCLC. MCLC was identical to AK2–8, identified as a differentially expressed gene in the hypothalamus (14Fukuhara C. Sophia Life Sci. Bull. 1996; 15: 79-93Google Scholar). A hydrophobicity profile of the sequence of MCLC displayed four potential transmembrane segments (M1–M4) (Fig. 1 B). Computer-based analysis indicated that MCLC contained a consensus sequence for nuclear localization signals (Fig. 1 A). There was no sequence similarity between MCLC and known channel families. There was, however, similarity in the sequence of the third transmembrane domain (Fig. 1 C). The amino acid sequence of this domain resembled those of members of the CLIC family. A BLAST search was performed on EST data bases with the rat MCLC sequence. Three human sequence tags were identified corresponding to the partial sequence of 5′ and 3′ regions. A cDNA template was synthesized from MCF7 and HepG2 cells using gene-specific primers, and PCR was performed to clone the complete coding sequence of human MCLC (Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1 D depicts the phylogenetic tree of rat, human, andXenopus MCLC. Northern blot analyses were carried out to examine the tissue distribution ofMCLC in the rat. Two hybridization band sizes were found in the rat tissues, including the spleen, liver, testis, kidney, heart, aorta, brain, and lung (Fig. 2). A strong expression was found in the testis. To clarify subcellular localization of MCLC protein, expression vector ratMCLC-pcDNA3, a FLAG tagged-MCLC pcDNA3, was constructed. Localization of MCLC protein was studied by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-MCLC antibody or anti-FLAG antibody in CHO cells stably expressing MCLC. A strong fluorescence staining was detected at the perinuclear region as well as in a fine reticular network extending through the cytoplasm (Fig.3 A). This pattern was also observed in all of the MCLC-expressing cells from multiple transient transfections (data not shown). This pattern was similar to that seen with known endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers such as calnexin (16David W. Hochstenbach F. Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9585-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). Localization of MCLC in ER was confirmed by colocalization of MCLC with ER-targeted enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (Fig. 3 C). MCLC is also localized in the Golgi apparatus. The colonization of a Golgi marker, anti-Golgi 58K (17Ktistakis N.T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with MCLC was observed in the transfected CHO cells (Fig. 3 D). MCLC was not localized in mitochondria, as assessed by using MitoTracker (data not shown). We also studied the localization of endogenous MCLC. Endogenous MCLC was detected in PC12 cells and A10 smooth muscle cells. The pattern of immunoreactive MCLC was similar to that of transfected cells mentioned above (data not shown). Western blot analysis was carried out to verify the expression of MCLC protein in transfected cells. Under nonreducing conditions, anti-FLAG antibodies detected a major band with a molecular mass of 120 kDa from CHO cells transfected with a tagged MCLC (Fig.4 A). Under reducing conditions, a molecular mass of 60 kDa was detected. A similar blot profile was obtained by using affinity-purified anti-MCLC antibody (Fig. 4 B). No signal was obtained from control CHO cells. The mass of 60 kDa was in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass of MCLC.Figure 4Western blotting of MCLC in CHO cells transfected with MCLC. CHO cells were transfected with rat MCLC (A) or FLAG-tagged rat MCLC (B), and Western blotting was done in the presence or absence of β-mercaptoethanol (ME) with either anti-FLAG antibody or anti-MCLC antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western blot analyses were then carried out to clarify endogenous MCLC protein expression in various rat tissues. The strong expression of MCLC with a molecular mass of 60 kDa was detected in the testis, liver, and lung (Fig.5). In the testis, a strong immunoreactivity was observed in primary spermatocytes (Fig.6 A). In these cells, staining of the cytoplasm and the nucleus was observed, and distribution of MCLC was different depending upon the stage of the spermatocyte. In some cells, immunoreactivity was found predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig.6 B), but in other cells MCLC was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 6 C). Note that immunoreactivity disappeared when the antibody was preincubated with the antigen peptide. In hepatocytes, cytoplasmic but not nuclear stainings were observed (data not shown).Figure 6Localization of immunoreactive MCLC in the testis. Immunohistochemistry was performed in tissue slices obtained from rat testis using anti-MCLC antibody. Immunoreactivity of MCLC is shown in brown. At lower magnification (A), immunoreactivity of MCLC was found in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. At higher magnification, immunoreactivity was found in the cytoplasm (B) or in the nucleus (C) depending upon the stage of spermatocytes. Magnification was as follows:A, × 400; B and C, × 1000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above findings indicated that MCLC was predominantly expressed in the intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. To clarify whether or not MCLC had a channel activity, we incorporated microsomal vesicles obtained from MCLC-transfected and mock-transfected CHO cells into the planar lipid bilayer and measured the channel activities. We confirmed the presence of MCLC protein in the microsomal fraction fromMCLC-transfected cells but not from mock-transfected cells by Western blotting (data not shown). Channel activities were consistently detected in microsomal vesicles obtained from MCLC-overexpressing CHO cells but not in those from mock-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 7 A, a bursting current was observed. The burst current showed open and closed states. Single channel conductance was determined by linear regression analysis of the current-voltage relationships in symmetrical 100 mm KCl solutions (Fig. 7 B). The slope conductance of the unitary current was 70.2 ± 5.0 picosiemens (mean ± S.D., n = 5). The channel was more permeable to anions than to cations. Based on the current-voltage relationship in asymmetrical KCl solutions (cis/trans, 500/100 mm), the reversal potential was −22.4 ± 1.0 mV (mean ± S.D.,n = 3). The permeability ratioPCl/PK was calculated to be 3.7 using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation. The permeabilities of various anions were also estimated from reversal potentials in asymmetric solutions of 100 mm KCl in thetrans compartment and 100 mm KBr, 100 mm KF, or 50 mm K2SO4in the cis compartment. The reversal potential for Br− was −1.8 mV (n = 3) and thePBr/PCl was 1.1. The reversal potential for F− and thePF/PCl value were +12.0 mV (n = 4) and 0.54, respectively. The reversal potential for SO4−2 and thePSO4/PCl value were +18.3 mV (n = 3) and 0.26, respectively. We then examined the effect of chloride channel blockers. 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS), known to be a specific inhibitor of various anion channels (18Bretag A.H. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 618-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), did not block the channel activity (data not shown). ATP, which blocks the anion channel in platelets (19Manning S.D. Williams A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), did not affect the channel activity. Note that Gd3+, a blocker of stretch-activated channels, did not affect the channel activity of MCLC. In the present study, we identified a gene, MCLC, using the MID-1 gene as a molecular probe. MCLC encoded a transmembrane protein with four putative transmembrane domains, but there was no overall similarity between MCLC and MID-1. MCLCwas identical to AK2–8, previously identified as a gene expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (14Fukuhara C. Sophia Life Sci. Bull. 1996; 15: 79-93Google Scholar), the expression of which changed according to diurnal rhythm. Fukuhara (14Fukuhara C. Sophia Life Sci. Bull. 1996; 15: 79-93Google Scholar) suggested that AK2–8 was involved in the regulation of circadian rhythm. Xenopus unknown transmembrane protein, aXenopus homologue of MCLC, was expressed in the pituitary. Yet the function of Xenopus unknown transmembrane protein or AK2–8 has not been identified. When MCLC was transfected in cultured cells, it localized in intracellular compartments but not in the plasma membrane. In culture cells, MCLC was expressed in the ER and the Golgi apparatus, as assessed by colocalization by the ER and Golgi markers. Although MCLC has a nuclear localization signal, MCLC is not targeted to the nucleus when transfected in various types of culture cells. As shown in Fig.6 A, however, MCLC expressed in the testis was localized in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm. In spermatocytes, strong immunoreactivity was found in the nucleus, and immunoreactive MCLC was condensed in the nucleus in some stages of the spermatocytes during maturation. The nuclear localization of MCLC in the nucleus of spermatocytes suggests that MCLC may play a critical role in spermatogenesis. MCLC has four putative transmembrane domains and is expressed in intracellular organelles. When microsomal vesicles obtained from MCLC-expressing cells were incorporated into the planar lipid bilayer, the chloride channel activity with a unitary conductance of 70 picosiemens was consistently observed. Such activity was not detected in microsomal vesicles obtained from mock-transfected cells. Given the primary structure of MCLC as a transmembrane protein, it is likely that MCLC functions as a chloride channel. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that MCLC exerts channel activity by interacting with other proteins in microsomal vesicles. Hence, we should await definitive evidence clarifying the function of purified MCLC protein in the lipid bilayer. Electrophysiologically, the MCLC channel permeates anions, and the sequence of permeability ratios was Br−≥Cl>F−>SO4−2. MCLC forms dimers when expressed in culture cells. These properties are different from those of members of known chloride channel families, in particular CLIC, which localizes in intracellular compartments. The primary structure of MCLC is also quite different from other chloride channel families so far identified. Hence, rat MCLC and its human andXenopus homologues belong to a new family of chloride channel. In this regard, the MCLC sequence in the third transmembrane domain shares similarity with most of the CLIC channel family (Fig.1 C). Because CLIC family members are expressed in intracellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum, the nuclear envelop, and endosome, the similarity between the two families may be interesting. It is possible that this region plays a critical role in the determination of either the localization or the function of these channels. During the course of the study to identify a mammalian stretch-activated channel, we obtained the cDNA of MCLCusing a sequence taken from a stretch-activated channel, Mid1–1. Unexpectedly, MCLC functions as a chloride channel expressed in intracellular membranes. A question then arises whether or not MCLC is activated by stretch of the membrane. Because we analyzed the channel activity of MCLC in the lipid bilayer, a direct answer to this question is not available. In this regard, Gd3+, which blocks stretch-activated channels (20Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Kung C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 633-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), did not affect the activity of MCLC. Consequently, there is no information at present suggesting that MCLC is regulated by stretch. Further studies are necessary to address this issue. With regard to ion selectivity, unlike Mid-1, MCLC functions as an anion channel. In many instances, ion selectivity is determined by amino acid composition of the channel pore. Although we obtainedMCLC using MID-1 as a probe, there is no sequence similarity between the transmembrane domains of the two gene products. It is conceivable that these two channels permeate different ions. In summary, we identified a new chloride channel family expressed in intracellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the nucleus. The physiological role of this channel remains to be elucidated. We are grateful to Dr. Masahiro Sokabe of Nagoya University and Dr. Hidetoshi Iida of Tokyo Gakugei University for various discussions and to Mayumi Odagiri for technical and secretarial assistance."

Proper communication between these processes depends on the transport of soluble factors between both compartments. Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking requires that proteins cross the nuclear envelope. To do so, proteins travel through nuclear pore complexes, large specialized structures that span both the inner and outer nuclear membrane. Proteins that are smaller than 40–60 kDa can diffuse through nuclear pore complexes without the requirement of energy. In contrast, macromolecules with a molecular mass larger than 40–60 kDa enter the nucleus via active transport (reviewed in Refs. 1Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W.

A variety of pathways mediate the nuclear accumulation of proteins too large to diffuse into the nucleus (reviewed in Refs. 1Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar and 2Stochaj U. Rother K.L. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 579-589Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In most cases, nuclear trafficking depends on specific carrier molecules termed importins. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 14 members of the β-importin family have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 3Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), three of which are essential for cell viability. These carriers are involved in nuclear export or import of proteins and RNA. At present, classical nuclear protein transport is the pathway understood best. This transport route requires an adaptor protein, α-importin (Srp1p in yeast) that links the nuclear cargo to β-importin (Rsl1p in yeast). Like other forms of nuclear transport, classical nuclear protein import requires energy, soluble transport factors, and nuclear localization sequences (NLSs),1 specialized signals that target proteins into the nucleus. In classical nuclear transport, these signals can be of two types: monopartite or bipartite. Monopartite signals are simple stretches of basic amino acids, whereas bipartite NLSs contain two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a spacer region (reviewed in Ref. 4Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). In addition to the well characterized classical nuclear import route, a variety of nonclassical pathways have been described that depend on other members of the β-importin family of carriers (3Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Frequently, nonclassical transport pathways are mediated by NLSs distinct from the simple or bipartite type, and such nonclassical NLSs do not share a consensus sequence. Examples of proteins containing a nonclassical NLS include the mammalian protein hnRNPA1 and the yeast protein Npl3p (1Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar,2Stochaj U. Rother K.L. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 579-589Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In general, proteins bearing a nonclassical NLS associate directly with a specific β-importin for targeting to the nucleus, without the requirement of an adaptor. Thus, β-importins have been shown to play a role in nuclear import of ribosomal proteins, transcription factors, or RNA-binding proteins (3Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Of particular interest are β-importins involved in trafficking of proteins that regulate the response to stress or changes in nutrient availability. For instance, Nmd5p mediates nuclear import of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Hog1p upon exposure to osmotic stress, and nuclear import is triggered by Hog1p phosphorylation (5Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5506-5614Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Another example of regulated nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is Mig1p, a transcription factor promoting glucose-mediated repression of several genes (6DeVit M.J. Johnston M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Removal of glucose from the growth medium induces Mig1p phosphorylation via Snf1p. Phosphorylated Mig1p is then recognized by the β-importin Msn5p and subsequently exported to the cytoplasm (6DeVit M.J. Johnston M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). During logarithmic growth, cells deplete their medium for nutrients and enter stationary phase. Under these conditions, a variety of genes modify their expression levels. Nutrient depletion represents a specific form of stress that inhibits classical nuclear transport and can also affect nonclassical transport pathways (7Stochaj, U., Rassadi, R., and Chiu, J. (September 8, 2000) FASEB J. 10.1096/fj.99-99-0751fje.Google Scholar). Moreover, various proteins regulating the response to changing nutrient concentrations, such as Mig1p, may alter their distribution between nucleus and cytoplasm (reviewed in Ref. 8Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Different forms of stress alter the cellular physiology and may damage cells. To survive and recover from stress-induced injury, cells need to activate specialized survival and repair mechanisms. In particular, heat shock proteins of the hsp70/hsc70 family play an essential role in these processes. Hsp70/hsc70s shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm (9Mandell R.B. Feldherr C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and accumulate in nuclei upon exposure to heat stress. Unlike heat shock, however, the effect of starvation on hsp70 localization has not been studied in detail. The yeast S. cerevisiae contains six members of the cytosolic hsp70 family. Cytosolic hsp70s are divided into two subfamilies: four SSA-encoded gene products (Ssa1p to Ssa4p) and two SSB gene products (Ssb1p and Ssb2p) (reviewed in Ref. 10Craig E.A. Baxter B.K. Becker J. Halladay J. Ziegelhoffer T. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 31-52Google Scholar). The SSA4 gene is particularly interesting as its expression is highly induced upon stress (10Craig E.A. Baxter B.K. Becker J. Halladay J. Ziegelhoffer T. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 31-52Google Scholar) and up-regulated during diauxic shift. Proteins of the SSA family are located in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, because they shuttle between both compartments under normal conditions. Unlike gene products of theSSA group, Ssb1p and Ssb2p are located predominantly in the cytoplasm. Ssb1p is prevented from nuclear accumulation due to the presence of a nuclear export signal in its N-terminal domain (11Shulga N. James P. Craig E.A. Goldfarb D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16501-16507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has not been analyzed previously whether nutrient depletion affects the localization of hsp70s. We have addressed this problem by generating fusions containing Ssa4p and GFP (Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein). We now show that upon starvation GFP fusion proteins carrying Ssa4p or its N-terminal domain accumulate in nuclei. We have identified a short hydrophobic segment in this N-terminal portion, referred to as the Star sequence, which is sufficient to direct non-nuclear reporter proteins to nuclei when cells are entering stationary phase. Moreover, we demonstrate that the β-importin Nmd5p is required to import a fusion between the Star sequence and β-galactosidase into nuclei of early stationary phase cells. Yeast strain RS453 (ade2 ADE3 leu2 ura3 trp1 his3), provided by V. Doye (Paris), was used as wild type strain. Mutant yeast strains were provided by G. Schlenstedt (Hamburg, Germany). Upon transformation, cells were grown in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil or leucine (dropout medium), depending on the selectable marker introduced by the plasmid. Cells were kept at room temperature unless indicated otherwise. Expression of genes controlled by the GAL1 orGALS promoter was induced with 2% galactose as a carbon source. For data shown in Fig. 2, cells were transferred for 6 h into fresh glucose-containing medium. The following inhibitors were added as indicated in the Fig. 2: 2 mm hydrogen peroxide (American Chemicals, Montreal), 2 mm diethyl maleate (Sigma), or 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). All plasmid constructions were carried out in Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue. The correctness of constructs was verified by sequencing with the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To generate fusions between GFP and SSA4, the GFPmut1 allele was used. GFPmut1 encodes a protein with ∼35 times the fluorescence intensity of the wild type (12Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene. 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGAD-GFP encodes NLS-GFP, a fusion protein that carries the classical SV40-NLS (13Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). pGAD-GFP was kindly provided by Dr. D. Goldfarb (Rochester, NY). For GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642), aNotI-linker (12-mer, New England Biolabs, Mississauga, ON) was inserted into the unique NlaIII site of SSA4, thereby generating plasmid p930. Plasmid p930 was cut withNotI, and the GFP-coding sequence was fused in-frame to codon 16 of SSA4; the fusion gene encodes GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642). For expression in yeast, the centromeric plasmid, which carries the URA3 selectable marker, was used as a vector. Expression of the gene fusions inserted into this plasmid is regulated by the GAL1 promoter. For generation of GFP-Star, GFP containing a NotI linker at the 3′-end (14Barth W. Chatterjee S. Stochaj U. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 355-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was fused to oligonucleotides encoding amino acid residues Ile-162 to Ile-171 of Ssa4p, followed by an UAG stop codon. To generate fusions between the Star sequence and β-galactosidase, oligonucleotides encoding methionine followed by the Star sequence were fused to the 5′-end of the β-galactosidase gene. To obtain GFP-β-galactosidase, enhanced green fluorescent protein (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was fused in-frame to the 5′-end of β-galactosidase. For expression in yeast, the Star-β-galactosidase gene was cloned into centromeric plasmids with either LEU2 or URA3 as a selectable marker. Yeast cells were transformed as described previously (14Barth W. Chatterjee S. Stochaj U. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 355-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and selected on dropout plates containing 2% glucose. GFP-containing reporter proteins were located by fluorescence microscopy as previously described (14Barth W. Chatterjee S. Stochaj U. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 355-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fusion proteins carrying β-galactosidase were located with monoclonal antibodies as detailed in Ref. 15Barth W. Stochaj U. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar. To detect GFP-Star and Star-β-galactosidase simultaneously, cells were grown in synthetic complete medium lacking both uracil and leucine and containing 2% galactose. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated overnight with monoclonal antibodies against β-galactosidase (diluted 1:500) and polyclonal antibodies against GFP (1:50,CLONTECH). Primary antibodies were detected with Cy3-conjugated affinity-purified antibodies against mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated affinity-purified antibodies to rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). DNA was visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fusions of GFP and members of the SSA family of proteins are proper models to study their targeting within the cell (11Shulga N. James P. Craig E.A. Goldfarb D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16501-16507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As described below, we have used proteins containing GFP and distinct segments of the cytoplasmic hsp70 Ssa4p for our studies. In logarithmically growing cells, the fusion protein GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642), which contains amino acid residues 16–642 of the authentic sequence of Ssa4p (642 amino acid residues), was both nuclear and cytoplasmic (Fig.1, A and B). By contrast, this protein accumulated in nuclei of stationary phase cells (Fig. 1, C and D). GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642) could exit the nucleus when cells were provided with fresh medium containing glucose (Fig. 1, E and F). This appearance in the cytoplasm did not reflect de novo gene expression, since glucose inhibits transcription from the GAL1 promoter. Export of GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642) from the nucleus was independent of the carbon source in the growth medium as the same result was obtained for cells incubated with nonfermentable substrates such as glycerol (Fig.1, G and H). Furthermore, nuclear export of GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642) was an active process that was inhibited if cells were kept at 4 °C (Fig. 1, I and J). For comparison, we have analyzed the localization of the GFP tag and NLS-GFP. GFP distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm under different growth conditions (Fig. 1, K–N). NLS-GFP, a substrate for classical nuclear transport, concentrated in nuclei of control cells but equilibrated between nucleus and cytoplasm in starving cells (Fig. 1, O–R, and Ref. 7Stochaj, U., Rassadi, R., and Chiu, J. (September 8, 2000) FASEB J. 10.1096/fj.99-99-0751fje.Google Scholar). Nuclear accumulation of GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642) in starving cells was reversible, and transfer to fresh medium promoted its export into the cytoplasm. Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and, in particular, nuclear export of several proteins is sensitive to oxidants (Refs. 16Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholarand 17Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 8Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When stationary phase cells were transferred to fresh medium containing glucose, both hydrogen peroxide and diethyl maleate strongly inhibited nuclear export of the fusion protein (Fig. 2, C–F). In contrast, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide had no effect on nuclear export, and GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642) appeared in the cytoplasm, as was observed in control cells (compare A and Bwith G and H in Fig. 2). To define regions of Ssa4p that are sufficient for nuclear accumulation when cells enter stationary phase, a fusion of the authentic 236 amino acid residues of Ssa4p to GFP was generated. This fusion protein, referred to as Ssa4p-(1–236)-GFP, lacks the bipartite NLS present in Ssa4p. In logarithmically growing cells, Ssa4p-(1–236)-GFP was found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig.3, A and B), similar to GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642). Moreover, Ssa4p-(1–236)-GFP concentrated in nuclei of starving cells (Fig. 3, C andD), demonstrating that the N-terminal segment of Ssa4p was sufficient to promote nuclear accumulation in stationary phase cells. As a control for a non-nuclear protein, the distribution of GFP-β-galactosidase was also monitored. This protein was cytoplasmic, with nuclei and vacuoles being excluded (Fig. 3, I andJ). It should be noted that nuclear accumulation of GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642), Ssa4p-(1–236)-GFP, GFP-Star, or Star-β-galactosidase (see below) was never complete, and a portion of the protein was always detected in the cytoplasm. Nuclear accumulation was also transient and preferentially detected in early stationary phase cells. Amino acid residues 162–171 of Ssa4p are mostly hydrophobic. The sequence Ile-Ala-Gly-Leu-Asn-Val-Leu-Arg-Ile-Ile (referred to as Star sequence, for starvation) fits the consensus sequence proposed for hydrophobic nuclear export signals (16Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, when fused to GFP, we did not detect nuclear exclusion (data not shown), but GFP-Star equilibrated between nucleus and cytoplasm in exponentially growing cells (Fig. 3,E and F). Importantly, GFP-Star concentrated in nuclei of starving cells (Fig. 3, G and H). Three different mechanisms could explain nuclear accumulation of GFP-Star in nutrient-depleted cells. In one scenario, due to its small size, GFP-Star diffuses into nuclei and may be retained when cells are starving. This would involve an interaction with nuclear proteins which provide anchors that prevent GFP-Star from diffusing into the cytoplasm. Alternatively, the Star sequence could function as an NLS that is active only under certain physiological conditions. Finally, a combination of nuclear retention and nuclear import may concentrate in nuclei reporter proteins containing the Star sequence. To begin to address these questions, we have generated the fusion protein Star-β-galactosidase. This fusion protein is too large to translocate across the nuclear envelope by passive diffusion; therefore, its nuclear localization would require transport into nuclei by an active process. As shown in Fig. 4, Star-β-galactosidase was able to accumulate in nuclei of stationary phase cells, supporting the idea that the Star sequence can function as an NLS. To compare the distribution of GFP-Star and Star-β-galactosidase under identical conditions, both proteins were synthesized in the same cell and localized in logarithmically growing as well as stationary phase cells (Fig. 4, A–F). GFP-Star and Star-β-galactosidase colocalized and concentrated in nuclei when cells were entering stationary phase (Fig. 4, D–F). Upon prolonged incubation of cells for several days in nutrient-depleted medium, the levels of GFP-Star and Star-β-galactosidase were reduced, and we no longer detected a concentration of the reporter proteins in nuclei (data not shown). This result most likely reflects protein degradation in starving cells. We have tested the nuclear accumulation of GFP-Star in yeast strains carrying a deletion in one of the β-importin genes. With the experiments shown in Fig. 5 and summarized in TableI, we followed the localization of GFP-Star in cells during logarithmic growth and in stationary phase. All of the mutants tested equilibrated GFP-Star between nucleus and cytoplasm when cells were growing logarithmically. However, GFP-Star accumulated in nuclei when cultures were in early stationary phase. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the concentration of the small protein GFP-Star in nuclei does not depend on one particular β-importin and may be achieved by nuclear retention only.Table IDistribution of GFP-Star and Star-β-galactosidase in wild type and mutant cellsGeneAlleleGFP-StarStar-β-galactosidaseLogarithmicStationaryLogarithmicStationaryWild typeN + CN>C, N + CN + CN>C, N + CYRB4(KAP123)yrb4∷TRP1N + CN>C, N + CN + CN>C, N + CNMD5(KAP119)nmd5∷TRP1N + CN>C, N + CN + CN + CKAP114kap114∷TRP1N + CN>C, N + CN + CN>C, N + CSXM1(KAP108)sxm1∷TRP1N + CN>C, N + CN + CN>C, N + CLPH2(KAP120)lph2∷TRP1N + CN>C, N + CN + CN>C, N + CMSN5(KAP142)msn5∷Tn LEU2N + CN>C, N + CN + CN>C, N + CIn wild type and mutant yeast strains inactivated for one of the β-importin genes, GFP-Star and Star-β-galactosidase were localized.

Open table in a new tab In wild type and mutant yeast strains inactivated for one of the β-importin genes, GFP-Star and Star-β-galactosidase were localized.

N + C denotes that reporter proteins were detected in nucleus and cytoplasm; nuclear accumulation was seen for N>C. Alternative names of the β-importin genes that have been inactivated are given in parentheses. To determine whether the deletion of a β-importin gene affects active nuclear import mediated by the Star sequence, we monitored the distribution of Star-β-galactosidase during logarithmic and stationary phases of the culture. As shown in Fig. 6 and summarized in Table I, most of the deletion mutants were able to accumulate Star-β-galactosidase in nuclei, supporting the idea that they are not required for nuclear import mediated by the Star sequence. However, cells lacking a functional NMD5 gene failed to concentrate Star-β-galactosidase in nuclei of early stationary phase cells (Fig.6, Table I), indicating that Nmd5p plays a role in these transport reactions. As a possible complication of our experiments, overexpression of Star-β-galactosidase may result in high levels of cytoplasmic protein, which could mask its nuclear accumulation. To obtain lower levels of gene expression, we cloned the Star-β-galactosidase gene into vectors carrying the GALS promoter (18Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). However, when we localized Star-β-galactosidase innmd5::TRP1 cells transformed with these plasmids, the reporter protein did not concentrate in nuclei when cells entered stationary phase (data not shown). These results further support the idea that Nmd5p is involved in nuclear import mediated by the Star sequence. Changes in physiological conditions require cells to adapt and, in response to various types of stress, proteins may alter their intracellular localization. In particular, trafficking between nucleus and cytoplasm is affected in cells exposed to oxidative or osmotic stress (reviewed in Ref. 8Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes in nutrient concentration have been shown to alter protein localization (6DeVit M.J. Johnston M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19Shiota C. Coffey J. Grimsby J. Grippo J.F. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1449-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For instance, the distribution of regulatory and catalytic subunits of protein kinase A in S. cerevisiae depends on the carbon source (20Griffioen G. Anghileri P. Imre E. Baroni M.D. Ruis H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1449-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Likewise, the distribution of hepatic glucokinase is altered in response to metabolic changes (19Shiota C. Coffey J. Grimsby J. Grippo J.F. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37125-37130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The effect of nutrient depletion on nucleocytoplasmic transport of heat shock proteins, however, has not been defined previously. Proteins of the hsp70 family are key components in the stress response, a process that is conserved among eukaryotes. We have now analyzed the effect of starvation on Ssa4p localization in budding yeast. To this end, distinct segments of Ssa4p were fused to the non-nuclear reporter proteins GFP or β-galactosidase. Both GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642) and Ssa4p-(1–236)-GFP concentrated in nuclei of starving cells during early stationary phase, indicating that the N-terminal domain of Ssa4p is sufficient for nuclear accumulation. Because Ssa4p-(1–236)-GFP is lacking the bipartite NLS present in authentic Ssa4p, a classical NLS is not required to concentrate the protein in the nuclei of starving cells. Within the N-terminal domain of Ssa4p we have identified a short stretch of 10 mostly hydrophobic amino acid residues, termed Star (for starvation), which is sufficient to promote nuclear concentration in nutrient-depleted cells. Thus, both GFP-Star as well as Star-β-galactosidase accumulate in nuclei of early stationary phase cells. Because the sequence context of Star is different in both fusion proteins, it rules out the possibility that an artificial nuclear targeting sequence was generated by linking the Star sequence to a reporter protein. Proteins that exceed the diffusion radius of the nuclear pore complex, like Star-β-galactosidase, must enter the nucleus by active transport, whereas small molecules can diffuse across nuclear pore complexes. We have demonstrated that Star-β-galactosidase concentrates in nuclei of starving cells, whereas NLS-GFP, a substrate for classical nuclear protein import, failed to accumulate. This suggests differences in the requirements for nuclear accumulation and the cellular apparatus mediating Star-β-galactosidase and classical NLS-dependent import. Our hypothesis is further supported by analyses of mutant yeast strains that carry a deletion of one of the β-importin genes, since we have identified Nmd5p as a β-importin that plays an essential role in nuclear accumulation of Star-β-galactosidase when cells enter stationary phase. By contrast, NLS-GFP is believed to be imported into nuclei by the classical nuclear import pathway, requiring α-importin and the β-importin Kap95p, and this pathway is inactivated in starving cells. Moreover, nuclear accumulation in starving cells is not a general feature of proteins carrying a nonclassical NLS. For instance, the yeast protein Npl3p contains a nonclassical NLS but fails to concentrate in nuclei of starving cells (7Stochaj, U., Rassadi, R., and Chiu, J. (September 8, 2000) FASEB J. 10.1096/fj.99-99-0751fje.Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the Star sequence functions as a special nonclassical NLS in starving cells. NMD5 is a nonessential gene that encodes a nuclear carrier which imports the mitogen-activated protein kinase Hog1p and the transcription elongation factor TFIIS into nuclei (5Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5506-5614Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 21Albertini M. Pemberton L. Rosenblum J.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have now identified the Star sequence as a signal that mediates nuclear transport via Nmd5p. Nuclear import via Nmd5p could occur by direct binding of a Star-containing protein to Nmd5p or by a piggyback mechanism that involves a linker molecule between Nmd5p and the Star sequence. At present, targeting signals recognized by Nmd5p are not defined, and future experiments will have to determine whether Nmd5p and the Star sequence interact directly. It should be noted that we did not detect nuclear exclusion of Star-β-galactosidase in cells carrying a deletion of NMD5. This might indicate that low amounts of Star-β-galactosidase enter the nucleus by an Nmd5p-independent mechanism. Like Star-β-galactosidase, GFP-Star may accumulate in nuclei by a special nuclear import pathway that is activated in starving cells (see model, Fig. 7). However, GFP-Star nuclear accumulation did not depend on any of the β-importins we have tested. Specifically, cells lacking a functional NMD5 gene concentrated GFP-Star in nuclei when entering stationary phase. The simplest explanation of these results is that nuclear accumulation of GFP-Star is achieved by nuclear retention. Due to its small size, GFP-Star diffuses in and out of the nucleus. Once translocated across the nuclear envelope, the Star sequence may bind to anchors that retain GFP-Star in nuclei (Fig. 7). On the basis of our results for Star-β-galactosidase and GFP-Star we propose that the Star sequence has two functions. First, it supports active nuclear import, a reaction that depends on Nmd5p. Second, the Star sequence associates with nuclear anchors that prevent its exit from the nucleus, a reaction independent of Nmd5p. Both signal functions, i.e. import and retention, seem to be activated when cells enter stationary phase. Nuclear accumulation of GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642) is reversible, indicating that starving cells, when provided with fresh nutrients, export the fusion protein into the cytoplasm. Because GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642) is too large to exit the nucleus by diffusion, nuclear export has to be mediated by an active process. This is in line with our observation that GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642) remains nuclear if cells are transferred to fresh medium but incubated at 4 °C. Moreover, nuclear export of GFP-Ssa4p-(16–642) is sensitive to oxidants that are known to inhibit other nuclear export processes (16Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our data allow us to propose the following model for protein localization mediated by the Star sequence (Fig. 7). In logarithmically growing cells a Star-containing protein can be found in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. The protein accumulates in nuclei of starving cells, a process that is mediated by Nmd5p-dependent nuclear import, with the Star sequence functioning as a special nonclassical NLS. Furthermore, nuclear retention promoted by the Star sequence prevents exit into the cytoplasm. At present, we can only speculate about the role of Ssa4p nuclear concentration in early stationary phase. Like nuclear accumulation of hsp70s upon heat shock, concentration of Ssa4p in nuclei may help reduce the denaturation of proteins in energy-depleted cells. Once provided with fresh nutrients, Ssa4p is released from nuclear anchors and may participate in refolding of nuclear proteins. Ultimately, Ssa4p nuclear export and shuttling will localize the protein to both nucleus and cytoplasm as observed in logarithmically growing cells. We thank V. Doye (Paris), D.

https://openalex.org/W2078037721,"Sialidosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by the genetic deficiency of lysosomal sialidase, which catalyzes the catabolism of sialoglycoconjugates. The disease is associated with progressive impaired vision, macular cherry-red spots, and myoclonus (sialidosis type I) or with skeletal dysplasia, Hurler-like phenotype, dysostosis multiplex, mental retardation, and hepatosplenomegaly (sialidosis type II). We analyzed the effect of the missense mutations G68V, S182G, G227R, F260Y, L270F, A298V, G328S, and L363P, which are identified in the sialidosis type I and sialidosis type II patients, on the activity, stability, and intracellular distribution of sialidase. We found that three mutations, F260Y, L270F, and A298V, which are clustered in the same region on the surface of the sialidase molecule, dramatically reduced the enzyme activity and caused a rapid intralysosomal degradation of the expressed protein. We suggested that this region might be involved in sialidase binding with lysosomal cathepsin A and/or β-galactosidase in the multienzyme lysosomal complex required for the expression of sialidase activity. Transgenic expression of mutants followed by density gradient centrifugation of cellular extracts confirmed this hypothesis and showed that sialidase deficiency in some sialidosis patients results from disruption of the lysosomal multienzyme complex.

The age of onset and severity of the clinical manifestations correlate with the amount of residual sialidase activity, suggesting the existence of considerable genetic heterogeneity (1Thomas G.H.

Although sialidosis was recognized as a deficiency of lysosomal sialidase from the moment of its discovery (16Cantz M. Gehler J. Spranger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of this disorder was not characterized for the following two decades because the identification and sequencing of sialidase had been hampered by low tissue content and instability of the enzyme. Several works have shown that sialidase is a part of a multienzyme complex containing other lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin A (protective protein), β-galactosidase, andN-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (17d'Azzo A.

Because the functional activity of sialidase completely depends on the integrity of its association with cathepsin A, it was hypothesized that cathepsin A supports catalytically active conformation of this enzyme (18Van der Horst G.J. Galjart N.J. d'Azzo A. Galjaard H. Verheijen F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1317-1322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the complex protects sialidase and β-galactosidase against rapid proteolysis (17d'Azzo A. Hoogeveen A. Reuser A.J. D. Robinson Galjaard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the autosomal recessive disease galactosialidosis, a primary genetic defect of cathepsin A (17d'Azzo A. Hoogeveen A. Reuser A.J. D. Robinson Galjaard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The clinical features and a composition of storage products in galactosialidosis resemble those in sialidosis (8Federico A. Cecio A. Battini G.A. Michalski J.C. Strecker G. Guazzi G.C. J. Neurol.

Recently the gene coding for sialidase was cloned, and a series of mutations in sialidosis patients was identified (27Bonten E. van der Spoel A. Fornerod M. Grosveld G. d'Azzo A.

Palmeri S. Pshezhetsky A.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In particular, we have found two frameshift and eight missense mutations in nine sialidosis patients of multiple ethnic origin (28Pshezhetsky A.V. Richard C. Michaud L. Igdoura S. Wang S. Elsliger M.A. Qu J. Leclerc D. Gravel R. Dallaire L. Potier M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 31Lukong K.E. Elsliger M.A. Chang Y. Richard C. Thomas G.

To understand the effect of these mutations on sialidase, we modeled the tertiary structure of the enzyme and localized the identified amino acid substitutions (31Lukong K.E. Elsliger M.A. Chang Y. Richard C. Thomas G. Carey W. Tylki-Szymanska A. Czartoryska B. Buchholz T. Criado G.R. Palmeri S. Pshezhetsky A.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, none of mutations directly affected the deduced active site residues or were found in the central core of the sialidase molecule, but all of them involved residues on the surface of the enzyme. Therefore, in most cases it was unlikely that these mutations would introduce electrostatic or steric clashes in the protein core leading to general folding defects of sialidase and its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartment, as was observed in most of the mutations affecting cathepsin A (32Rudenko G. Bonten E. Hol W.G.H. d'Azzo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 615-621Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that three sialidase mutants that have amino acid substitutions clustered in one region on the surface of the sialidase molecule were correctly processed and sorted but were not associated with the complex and were rapidly degraded in the lysosome. These results permitted us to conclude that the surface region containing these mutations may be involved in the sialidase binding interface with the lysosomal multienzyme complex and that sialidase deficiency in sialidosis patients may be secondary to the disruption of the lysosomal multienzyme complex. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH), the previously described pCMV-SIAL expression vector, mutagenic primers corresponding to mutant sialidase sequences, and a selection primer used to eliminate a uniqueScaI restriction site in the vector according to supplier's protocols. All primers were enzymatically phosphorylated, and for each mutant the corresponding mutagenic primer and the selection primer were annealed to a heat-denatured pCMV-SIAL plasmid. After elongation by T4 DNA polymerase, ligation, and primary digestion with ScaI restriction enzyme to linearize all nonmutated DNA, the plasmid pool was used to transform the mutS strain of BMH71–18 bacteria. Plasmid DNA obtained from the pool of ampicillin-resistant transformants was subjected to a second ScaI digestion and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. Positive clones were selected after a final ScaI restriction analysis, and the entire sialidase cDNA was sequenced. Up to 80% of transformants contained the desired mutation. DNA fragments of between 300 and 600 base pairs containing the introduced mutations were obtained from the mutant pCMV-SIAL plasmids by double digestion with either BstEII/NaeI,NaeI/KpnI, or KpnI/EcoRV enzymes and subcloned into the parental pCMV-SIAL plasmid. The final constructs were verified by sequencing. COS-7 cells seeded in T-25 flasks or 60-mm round dishes were co-transfected with pCMV-SIAL and pCMV-CathA expression vectors (31Lukong K.E. Elsliger M.A. Chang Y. Richard C. Thomas G. Carey W. Tylki-Szymanska A. Czartoryska B. Buchholz T. Criado G.R. Palmeri S. Pshezhetsky A.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection, sialidase and control N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase activities were assayed in cellular homogenates using the corresponding fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates as described (33Okada S. O'Brien J.S. Science. 1968; 160: 1002-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 34Potier M. Mameli L. Belisle M. Dallaire L. Melançon S.B. Anal.

Cell. 1979; 17: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The cathepsin A activity was determined with benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu and 3-(2-furyl)acryloyl-Phe-Leu substrates (36Pshezhetsky A.V. Vinogradova M.V. Elsliger M-A. El-Zein F. Svedas V.K. Potier M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate/min. Proteins were assayed according to Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with BSA1 (Sigma) as the standard. To measure the stability of the expressed sialidase, the cellular homogenate was incubated at 37 °C for 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h before the assay of sialidase activity. 48 h after transfection with wild-type or mutant sialidase cDNA, COS-7 cells grown to confluency in 60-mm dishes were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution, incubated for 2 h in cysteine and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented withl-glutamine and sodium pyruvate, then incubated again for 40 min in 5 ml of the same medium supplemented with a mixture of [35S]Cys and [35S]Met (Tran35S-label, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.; 0.1 mCi/ml medium). The radioactive medium was then removed, and the cells were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution and chased at 37 °C in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum with and without protease inhibitor leupeptin (5 μg/ml). At the time indicated in the figures, the cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, then lysed for 30 min in 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm α-toluenesulfonyl fluoride (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove the cell debris. 1.0 ml of lysate was incubated for 4 h with preimmune serum at a final dilution of 1:20. Then the pellet obtained from 300 μl of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) was added, and the resulting suspension was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated overnight with the anti-sialidase antibodies at a 1:100 final dilution, then for 2 h at 4 °C with the pellet from 100 μl of Pansorbin cells and precipitated as above. The pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer. The antigens were eluted from the pellet by the addition of 100 μl of a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 m dithiothreitol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min, and 50 μl of each sample were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The molecular weights were determined with 14C-labeled protein markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gels were fixed in acetic acid/isopropyl alcohol/water (10:50:40), soaked for 30 min in Amplify™ solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), vacuum-dried at 60 °C, and analyzed by quantitative fluorometry on a PhosphorImager SI analysis screen (Molecular Dynamics) using the software supplied by the manufacturer. 48 h after transfection with wild-type or mutant sialidase, COS-7 cells were treated for 40 min with 75 nm LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) dye, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 40 min. Cells were permeabilized by incubating with 0.3% Triton X-100, washed twice with PBS, and stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-sialidase antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against rabbit IgG. Alternatively, cells were double-stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-sialidase antibodies and monoclonal antibodies against lysosomal membrane marker LAMP-2 (Washington Biotechnology Inc., Baltimore, MD). Slides were studied on a Zeiss LSM410 inverted confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). COS-7 cells grown to confluency in T-25 flasks and harvested 48 h after transfection with wild-type or mutant sialidase were solubilized in 0.2 ml of 0.15 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, containing 0.5 mg of BSA/ml and 1% (w/v) ZwitterionicTM detergent 3–12 (Calbiochem) as described (19Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28359-28365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatants were applied on the top of the density gradient of 30% metrizamide (OptiPrep; Nycomed Amersham) preformed by a 2-h ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-55 Ti swinging bucket rotor. After application of the sample, the centrifugation was continued for an additional 17 h at the same speed. Immediately after centrifugation, each tube was divided into 10 fractions using a Beckman tube slicer kit. Each fraction was assayed for activities of sialidase, β-galactosidase, and cathepsin A as well as for the presence of human sialidase and cathepsin A protein by Western blot as previously described (20Vinogradova M.V. Michaud L. Mezentsev A.V. Lukong K.E. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The activity of endogenous N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase in fractions was used as an internal control. The molecular masses of proteins were approximated using the followingMr standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): thyroglobulin (Mr = 669,000), catalase (Mr = 232,000), and BSA (Mr = 69,000). Thyroglobulin and BSA were covalently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate to facilitate their detection in fractions containing proteins from a COS-7 cell. The modeling was performed using the structures of homologous sialidases fromMicromonospora viridifaciens (Ref. 39Burmeister W.P. Ruigrok R.W.H. Cusack S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank file 1eur.pdb), Salmonella typhimurium (Ref. 40Varghese J.N. Laver W.G. Colman P.M. Nature. 1983; 303: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank file 2sil.pdb), and Vibrio cholerae (Ref. 41Crennell S.J. Garman E.F. Laver W.G. Vimr E.R. Taylor G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9852-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank file 1kit.pdb) as templates. These structures were superimposed with ProSup King's Beech Biosoftware Solutions to determine structurally conserved regions. The sequence of human sialidase was manually aligned with the sequences of structurally conserved regions. The modeling was then carried out with Modeler 4 software (Andrej Sali, The Rockefeller University, New York). The effect of sialidase mutations on enzyme biogenesis was studied by the transient expression of the mutant cDNA. Mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis in the pCMV-SIAL vector previously used for the expression of sialidase (28Pshezhetsky A.V. Richard C. Michaud L. Igdoura S. Wang S. Elsliger M.A. Qu J. Leclerc D. Gravel R. Dallaire L. Potier M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Short restriction cassettes containing the mutations were then inserted into the parental pCMV-SIAL vector replacing the corresponding fragments of wild-type sialidase cDNA. The inserts and junction regions of the resulting constructs were verified by sequencing to ensure the correct introduction of mutations. Mutant or wild-type sialidase was co-expressed with human cathepsin A, which is necessary for the expression of sialidase activity. 48 h after transfection, the cell lysates were assayed for sialidase, cathepsin A, and control β-hexosaminidase activities. The expression results are shown in TableI. All transfected cells had similar cathepsin A activity, suggesting the same transfection efficiency for all cells. Four of the expressed mutants, G68V, G227R, A298V, and L363P, had very low (<10% of normal) sialidase activity. The activity of F260Y and L270F mutants was between 10 and 20% of normal, and that of S182G and G328S mutants was between 20 and 40% of normal. Additional experiments showed that F260Y, A298V, and L270F mutants were also significantly less stable than the wild-type sialidase. The half-life of their enzymatic activity in cellular lysates at 37 °C was about 30 min as compared with the 2-h half-life of the wild-type enzyme.Table IEnzymatic and biochemical properties of sialidase mutants expressed in COS-7 cellsMutationEnzymatic activityTraffic to lysosomesShortt1/2Complex formation%Wild-type100+−+G68VND 1-aND, not detected.

To identify the lysosomal late endosomal compartment, the COS-7 cells were treated for 40 min with 75 nm LysoTracker Red DND-99 dye prior to fixation and immunostaining with anti-sialidase antibodies. Alternatively the cells were double-stained with anti-sialidase antibodies and monoclonal antibodies against human LAMP-2. For the wild-type sialidase we have observed the complete co-localization of anti-sialidase immunostaining with lysosomal markers LysoTracker Red (Fig. 1) or LAMP-2 (not shown). The G68V, S182G, F260Y, L270F, A298V, and G328S mutants showed similar localization, suggesting that the mutant protein is able to reach the lysosomes. Although partial co-localization of anti-sialidase and LysoTracker staining was also detectable in the cells transfected with the G227R and L363P mutants, the majority of the anti-sialidase antibodies labeled distinct cellular areas, suggesting that in this case the mutant protein is mostly retained in prelysosomal compartments. This finding is consistent with the results of structural modeling of sialidase mutants that suggested general folding defects and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartment for both G227R and L363P substitutes (31Lukong K.E. Elsliger M.A. Chang Y. Richard C. Thomas G. Carey W. Tylki-Szymanska A. Czartoryska B. Buchholz T. Criado G.R. Palmeri S. Pshezhetsky A.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The results of sialidase activity assay in COS-7 cells expressing sialidase mutants have shown that some of them, i.e. L270F, A298V, and F260Y mutants, had significantly lower stability in cellular homogenates than the wild-type enzyme. To measure the stability of sialidase mutants in the cell, we performed pulse-chase experiments. The 46–48-kDa polypeptides similar to those previously observed by both immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (20Vinogradova M.V. Michaud L. Mezentsev A.V. Lukong K.E. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were precipitated by anti-sialidase antibodies from homogenates of cells transfected with wild-type or mutant sialidase cDNA and pulsed for 40 min (Fig.2). The intensities of both bands decreased proportionally with the time of chase. By 4 h of chase, normal wild-type sialidase was reduced to ∼50% of total. In contrast, the degradation rate of F260Y, L270F, and A298V mutants was remarkably increased so that for all these cells 46–48-kDa sialidase bands were already nearly undetectable after 4 h of chase. The same degradation rate was observed with and without leupeptin, a potent inhibitor of lysosomal serine and thiol proteases, suggesting that they are not involved in the degradation of mutant sialidase. The ability of sialidase mutants to associate with the lysosomal multienzyme complex was studied by the density gradient ultracentrifugation of the cell extracts (Fig.3). In the extracts of COS-7 cells co-transfected with wild-type sialidase and cathepsin A, all sialidase activity was associated with the peak that sedimented before thyroglobulin (Mr = 669,000). This peak, which also contained almost all the cathepsin A and the majority of endogenous β-galactosidase activities, probably represented the lysosomal multienzyme complex (Fig. 3 A). A similar sedimentation profile was observed in the extracts of cells transfected with sialidase G328S or S182G mutants. Although about 3-fold less sialidase activity was detected in the collected fractions as compared with that of the wild-type control, all activity was associated with the high molecular weight fraction. The distribution of sialidase and cathepsin A proteins detected by Western blot (Fig. 3 B) followed that of the enzyme activity. In contrast, in the cells transfected with G227R, F260Y, L270F, and A298V mutants, the high molecular weight form of sialidase was not detected. Both sialidase protein and the trace levels of sialidase activity were found in the peak that sedimented together with the low molecular weight marker, BSA (Mr = 69,000), suggesting that the mutant enzyme does not associate with the multienzyme complex. Moreover, although a significant amount of sialidase cross-reacting protein was detected in these fractions for F260Y, L270F, and A298V transfected cells, the sialidase activity was ∼50–100-fold reduced as compared with wild-type enzyme, which is consistent with the inactivation of sialidase after the dissociation from the complex. Analysis of molecular defects in the sialidase gene in sialidosis patients shows that the spectrum of mutations is very different from that in cathepsin A and β-galactosidase, which underlies clinically similar disorders galactosialidosis and GM1-gangliosidosis, respectively. Most of the sialidosis patients studied so far, 21 of 27, had amino acid substitutions and not frameshift or splicing defects 2H. Sakuraba, private communication. (27Bonten E. van der Spoel A.

The localization of the missense mutations on the sialidase structural model (Fig. 4) suggested that only few of them (shown in blue in Fig. 4) affect active site residues (Y370C) or may interfere with their correct positions (L91R with the active site residue Arg78, P80L with Arg97, duplication of His399 and Tyr400 with Glu394, P316S with Arg280, and P335Q with Arg341). In addition, the L363P mutation is situated on a β-strand adjacent to that containing the active site residue Tyr370. The Leu363 residue is probably necessary to anchor this β-strand to the one containing Tyr370 so that the L363P mutation can potentially also have an effect on the active site. However, in contrast to cathepsin A mutations in galactosialidosis patients, which mostly affect the enzyme central core and cause unfolding of the protein (32Rudenko G. Bonten E. Hol W.G.H. d'Azzo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 615-621Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the majority of sialidase mutations involves residues on the surface of the enzyme and is not supposed to result in significant structural change. Moreover, the distribution of mutations on the sialidase surface is uneven. The region that contains the majority of mutations resulting in complete or almost complete inactivation of the enzyme and causing severe sialidosis type II phenotype is easily detectable (shown in red in Fig. 4). In particular this region contains mutations G227R, F260Y, L270F, and A298V (28Pshezhetsky A.V. Richard C. Michaud L. Igdoura S. Wang S. Elsliger M.A. Qu J. Leclerc D. Gravel R. Dallaire L. Potier M.

We expressed eight sialidase mutants, four of which contained amino acid substitution in the defined surface patch (G227R, F260Y, L270F, and A298V) and four in the other areas of the sialidase molecule (G68V, S182G, G328S, and L363P) in COS-7 cells and studied trafficking, activity, and stability of the produced protein. We found that in two cases (G227R and L363P) the majority of the mutant protein was not sorted to the lysosomes, suggesting that these mutations can cause general folding defects and retention of the mutant in the pre-lysosomal compartments. All other expressed sialidase mutants were targeted to lysosomes and correctly processed. Subsequent experiments revealed that the sialidase mutants F260Y, L270F, and A298V containing amino acid substitutions in the surface patch of the fifth β-sheet have similar properties. First, they had very low or absent sialidase activity. Second, stability of sialidase mutants in cellular homogenates or their half-life in the cell as estimated by metabolic labeling was significantly lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. In addition, previous analysis of COS-7 cells transfected with F260Y, L270F, and A298V mutants by Western blot (31Lukong K.E. Elsliger M.A. Chang Y. Richard C. Thomas G. Carey W. Tylki-Szymanska A.

The same pattern of sialidase degradation products was also observed in the cells of a galactosialidosis patient that lacked functional cathepsin A (20Vinogradova M.V. Michaud L. Mezentsev A.V. Lukong K.E. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling studies (20Vinogradova M.V. Michaud L. Mezentsev A.V. Lukong K.E. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) also demonstrated the dramatically reduced half-life of wild-type sialidase expressed in galactosialidosis cells (30 min versus 2.7 h in normal cells) similar to that observed in this work. Together these data suggest that F260Y, L270F, and A298V mutants are not protected by cathepsin A, although the same high amount of functional human cathepsin A was expressed by COS-7 cells in all cases. Indeed, in the extracts of cells transfected with F260Y, L270F, and A298V mutants we could not detect a high molecular weight complex of sialidase with cathepsin A. Instead we observed that sialidase protein sedimented during the density gradient centrifugation together with low molecular weight marker BSA. Therefore in the case of F260Y, L270F, and A298V mutations, the deficit of sialidase activity resulted from the disruption of normal protein-protein interactions in the lysosome. Further studies should show if this mechanism is unique for sialidase or extends to other lysosomal enzymes. We thank Dr. Hitoshi Sakuraba, who generously provided unpublished information.

TBP specifically recognizes TATA elements, whereas certain TAFs directly interact with initiator or downstream promoter elements. In addition to a role in core promoter recognition, TAFs have been proposed to function as targets of activators. Subsets of TAFs have also been found in histone acetylase complexes distinct from TFIID (3Struhl K. Moqtaderi Z.

Interestingly, inactivation of some TAFs results in cell cycle phenotypes. yTAF130/145 inactivation leads to G1arrest, whereas inactivation of yTAF90 or yTAF150/TSM1 results in G2/M arrest (5Walker S.S.

Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis has been shown to play a key role in progression through the cell cycle (27King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.-M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). A ubiquitin-protein ligase complex known as the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) promotes the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and the exit from mitosis by mediating ubiquitination of anaphase inhibitors and mitotic cyclins, leading to their destruction by the 26 S proteasome (28Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcP4 seems to be involved in APC/C-mediated proteolysis (29Osaka F. Seino H. Seno T. Yamao F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). First, depletion of UbcP4, like mutations in APC/C subunit genes such ascut9 +, blocks the initiation of anaphase. Second, overexpression of UbcP4 suppresses a cut9 mutation. Finally, among the family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, UbcP4 is most closely related to clam E2-C, Xenopus UBCx, and human UbcH10, all of which are involved in ubiquitination of mitotic cyclins. We report here the isolation of two related TAF genes,taf72 + and taf73 +, fromS. pombe as multicopy suppressors of a temperature-sensitiveubcP4 mutation. TAF72 and TAF73 proteins have homology to WD repeat-containing TAFs such as hTAF100, dTAF80/85, and yTAF90. We show that both TAF72 and TAF73 are associated with TBP and other TAFs, whereas only TAF72 is associated with Gcn5, a putative histone acetylase. We also show that taf72 + andtaf73 + suppress a mutation in thecut9 + gene. These results suggest that TAF72 and TAF73 may regulate the expression of genes involved in progression through the M phase of the cell cycle. The following S. pombe strains were used in this study: JY741 (h − ade6-M216 leu1 ura4-D18), JY746 (h + ade6-M210 leu1 ura4-D18), ubcP4ts (h − ade6-M210 ura4 leu1 ubcP4-140::ura4 +) (this study), cut9ts (h − leu1 cut9-665; a gift from Mitsuhiro Yanagida) (30Samejima I.

AnXhoI-XbaI fragment containing theubcP4 + gene was cloned into theSalI/XbaI site of pUC19ΔSS, a pUC19 derivative lacking the SspI site. A ura4 +fragment was inserted into the SspI site located 440 base pairs downstream of the ubcP4 + gene. AubcP4 +::ura4 +fragment was amplified by PCR in the presence of 0.5 mmMnCl2 and used to transform an S. pombe ura4strain. Ura+ transformants selected at 25 °C were replica-plated onto EMM + AdeLeu containing phloxine B (Sigma), and the plates were incubated at 36 °C. Inability of one clone to grow at 36 °C was complemented by the pREP81-ubcP4 plasmid, indicating that the clone contains a recessive, temperature-sensitive mutation in the ubcP4 + gene, which was designatedubcP4-140. Replacement of ubcP4 + byubcP4-140::ura4 + was confirmed by Southern analysis. Sequencing of the ubcP4-140allele identified two amino acid substitutions: isoleucine by threonine at position 80 and threonine by alanine at position 129. A ubcP4-140 strain was transformed with an S. pombe genomic library constructed with the multicopy plasmid pSP1 (34Cottarel G. Beach D. Deuschle U. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Leu+ transformants selected on EMM + Ade at 25 °C were replica-plated onto EMM + Ade containing phloxine B, and the plates were incubated at 35 °C. Plasmids were recovered from white colonies grown at 35 °C and used to retransform the ubcP4-140 strain. Subcloning of inserts from two plasmids (pSP1-7 and pSP1-19) resulted in 2.6-kbSacI-HindIII and 2.2-kbSalI-HindIII fragments capable of suppression (see Fig. 3 A). Sequencing followed by data base searches using the BLAST program revealed that the former contained thetaf72 + gene (35Yamamoto T. Poon D. Weil P.A. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the latter contained a related but previously unidentified gene. This gene was namedtaf73 + and analyzed further.taf73 + cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR, cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and sequenced. A 3′-portion of taf73 + cDNA was also amplified by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and sequenced. A 3.0-kb genomic DNA fragment containing thetaf73 + gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEM-T to generate pGEM-T(taf73). The entire vector sequence flanked by 5′- and 3′-noncoding sequences of taf73 + was amplified from pGEM-T(taf73) by PCR, digested with XhoI andSmaI, and ligated with a 1.8-kbXhoI-SmaI ura4 + fragment to generate pGEM-T(Δtaf73::ura4). A 2.7-kb blunt-end Δtaf73::ura4 + fragment was amplified from pGEM-T(Δtaf73::ura4) by PCR with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and used for the one-step gene disruption (36Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). After transformation, Ura+ colonies were screened for sensitivity to 5-fluoroorotic acid (Toronto Research Chemicals). Correct disruption was confirmed by PCR. Complementation by a taf73 + plasmid (Table I) also confirmed correct disruption.Table IOverexpression of TAF72 does not suppress Δtaf73PlasmidNo. of tetrads for the indicated no. of viable sporesNo. of spores01234Ura+ 1-aUra+ spores are presumed to be Δtaf73∷ura4 +segregants.

Transformants with pSP1 (Vector), pSP1–7 (taf72 +), or pSP1–19 (taf73 +) were sporulated and subjected to tetrad analysis. To construct S. pombe strains expressing FLAG or HA epitope-tagged TAF protein, DNA fragments that encode epitope-tagged TAF were amplified by PCR using primers with overlapping extension (37Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) and used to replace the chromosome segment by transplacement (38Winston F. Chumley F. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Strains expressing FLAG-tagged TAF72 or TAF73, in which a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was inserted at the N terminus of the TAF72 or TAF73 protein, were constructed as follows. DNA fragments containing both a 5′-noncoding region and a 5′-portion of the coding sequence with the FLAG sequence immediately after the initiation codon were amplified by PCR and cloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene) carrying aura4 + fragment. The resulting plasmids were linearized at a unique restriction site within thetaf genes (AatII fortaf72 + and SpeI fortaf73 +) (see Fig. 3 A) and used to transform strain JY741. Integration into the taf locus on the chromosome results in a full-length taf gene with the FLAG sequence and a 3′-truncated taf gene that are separated by the ura4 + plasmid sequence. Correct integration was confirmed by PCR. Recombination that occurs upstream of the FLAG sequence leaves only a FLAG-TAF gene on the chromosome. 5-Fluoroorotic acid-resistant segregants were screened by PCR for the presence of the FLAG sequence to obtaintaf FLAG strains. Similarly, an S. pombe strain expressing HA-tagged TAF73, in which three copies of an HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) were inserted at the N terminus of the TAF73 protein, was constructed using strain JY746. Thistaf73 HA strain was crossed with the wild-type,taf72 FLAG, and taf73 FLAGstrains described above to construct diploid strains expressing HA-TAF73; HA-TAF73 and FLAG-TAF72; and HA-TAF73 and FLAG-TAF73, respectively. S. pombe strains expressing HA-tagged Gcn5, in which three copies of an HA epitope were inserted at the N terminus of the Gcn5 protein, were constructed using the wild-type,taf72 FLAG, and taf73 FLAGstrains. A DNA fragment containing a 5′-noncoding region and a 5′-portion of the coding sequence with the triple HA sequence immediately after the initiation codon was cloned into theura4 + plasmid. Linearization withNruI followed by integration into the S. pombechromosome resulted in strains expressing HA-Gcn5; HA-Gcn5 and FLAG-TAF72; and HA-Gcn5 and FLAG-TAF73, respectively. S. pombe strains were grown to an A600 of 0.5 (1 × 107 cells/ml) in 200 ml of YE + AdeUra medium at 30 °C. Cells were harvested, washed with H2O, transferred to a 2.0-ml tube, and frozen at −80 °C. The cells (∼350 mg) were resuspended in 700 μl of buffer A (20 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (or 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then disrupted with 1 ml of glass beads (∼0.5 mm in diameter) six times for 1 min using a BeadBeater (BioSpec Products). Cell lysates were recovered through a small hole punched at the bottom of the tube and clarified twice by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration of the extracts was typically ∼20 mg/ml. For immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, 300–500 μl of whole-cell extract was mixed with 0.2 volume of a slurry of anti-FLAG M2-agarose and incubated for 2–4 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. For immunoprecipitation with anti-TBP antibody, 200 μl of whole-cell extract was mixed with 10 μl of anti-S. pombe TBP serum or preimmune serum and incubated for 1 h on ice, and then 40 μl of a slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A, resuspended in 1.5× SDS gel loading buffer, and frozen at −80 °C. Proteins that had derived from 750 or 1500 μg of total protein were separated by 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and probed with antibodies. Immune complexes were detected by chemiluminescence. In some cases, a blot was stripped before reprobing. Rabbit anti-S. pombe TBP, anti-S. pombe TAF130, and anti-S. pombe PTR6 polyclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Tetsuro Kokubo (Nara Institute of Science and Technology). Mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and anti-FLAG M2-agarose were purchased from Sigma, and mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (16B12) was purchased from BAbCO. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used as secondary antibodies. The sequence of thetaf73 + gene has been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM Data Bank under accession numberAB039954. In the course of this study, we noticed that the sequence of a genomic DNA fragment containing the taf73 +gene was determined by the S. pombe Genome Sequencing Project. Our taf73 + sequence is identical to the sequence of the predicted gene SPBC15D4.14 on cosmid c15D4 (accession number AL031349). Depletion of the UbcP4 protein, anS. pombe ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, blocks the initiation of anaphase in mitosis, suggesting a role of UbcP4 in cell cycle progression through mitosis (29Osaka F. Seino H. Seno T. Yamao F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend this result, we isolated a temperature-sensitive mutation in theubcP4 + gene (designated ubcP4-140 orubcP4 ts) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A ubcP4-140 strain showed a rapid cessation of cell growth when the culture was shifted from 25 to 36 °C (Fig.1 A). After the shift to 36 °C, the following types of cells accumulated: metaphase-arrested cells with condensed chromosomes, septated cells without chromosome segregation, and cells undergoing cytokinesis without chromosome segregation (a cut phenotype) (Fig. 1 B). At 6 h after the shift, ∼30% of the cells showed septation or cytokinesis without chromosome segregation. Thus, theubcP4 ts mutation seems to block the initiation of anaphase, thereby causing uncoordinated mitosis where septation or cytokinesis occurs without chromosome segregation. This phenotype closely resembles those caused by mutations in the cut genes that encode components of APC/C such as cut9-665 (30Samejima I. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1655-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) andcut4-533 (39Yamashita Y.M. Nakaseko Y. Samejima I. Kumada K. Yamada H. Michaelson D. Yanagida M. Nature. 1996; 384: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is therefore most likely that UbcP4, in conjunction with APC/C, functions in ubiquitination of proteins required for progression through mitosis, including the anaphase inhibitor (securin) Cut2 and the mitotic cyclin Cdc13 (40Yanagida M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 144-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The ubcP4-140 mutation was used for isolation of multicopy suppressors that enable growth at 35 °C (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2). Screening of anS. pombe genomic library unexpectedly identified two related genes that encode proteins with homology to WD repeat-containing TAFs such as hTAF100, dTAF80/85, and yTAF90 (Fig.3). One gene (represented by five clones) was found to be taf72 +, a putative TAF gene isolated on the basis of sequence similarity (35Yamamoto T. Poon D. Weil P.A. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thetaf72 + gene encodes a protein of 643 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 72.4 kDa, but its association with TBP has not been demonstrated. The other gene (represented by two clones) was a previously unidentified gene, which has been namedtaf73 +. A comparison between the genomic DNA and cDNA sequences of the taf73 + gene revealed that there is a 56-base pair intron (nucleotides 1474–1529) with consensus sequences for splicing (41Zhang M.Q. Marr T.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1750-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The taf73 + gene encodes a protein of 642 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 72.3 kDa. Like other WD repeat-containing TAFs, TAF73 contains six WD repeats (23Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) in its C-terminal half (Fig. 3 B). The TAF73 protein is 45% identical to TAF72, 39% identical to yTAF90, 30% identical to hTAF100, and 29% identical to dTAF80/85. Similarity was observed throughout the proteins, although the C-terminal regions show higher degrees of conservation (Fig. 3 B). TAF72 is more similar to yTAF90, hTAF100, and dTAF80/85 than TAF73 is. We also compared TAF72 and TAF73 with PAF65β, an hTAF100-related protein present in the human histone acetylase complexes PCAF and TFTC (25Brand M. Yamamoto K. Staub A. Tora L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18285-18289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 26Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.-J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Both TAF72 and TAF73 are less related to PAF65β (27 and 22% identical, respectively) than to hTAF100 (34 and 30% identical). To test the possibility that the suppression of theubcP4 ts mutation by taf72 + ortaf73 + results from an increase inubcP4 expression, we carried out Northern analysis.ubcP4 mRNA levels were not affected by multicopy plasmids carrying the taf72 + ortaf73 + gene (Fig.4). We speculate that the suppression results from increased expression of some other genes involved in APC/C-mediated proteolysis (see “Discussion”). Suppression of theubcP4 ts mutation seems to be specific to thetaf72 + and taf73 + genes because no other TAF genes were isolated in our library screen. Thetaf72 + gene is essential for cell viability (35Yamamoto T. Poon D. Weil P.A. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To determine whether taf73 + is also an essential gene, we constructed a diploid S. pombe strain in which one copy of taf73 + was disrupted. Thetaf73 +/Δtaf73::ura4 +cells were sporulated and subjected to tetrad analysis. Of 34 tetrads dissected, 0, 1, and 2 viable spores were observed for 2, 15, and 17 tetrads, respectively, and no tetrads with more than 2 viable spores were recovered (Fig. 5). Importantly, all the viable spores were Ura− and thus presumed to betaf73 +. Microscopic observation of the 34 Δtaf73::ura4 + spores revealed that most spores germinated and divided three times before they ceased growing (no spores divided more than four times). In addition, Δtaf73::ura4 +haploid cells carrying a taf73 plasmid, pREP81(taf73cDNA), did not lose the plasmid under nonselective conditions. These results indicate that thetaf73 + gene, like taf72 +, is essential for cell viability. The Δtaf73 strain carrying the plasmid pREP81(taf73cDNA) grew even under conditions that repress taf73 + expression (i.e.in the presence of thiamine), indicating that residual expression allows cells to grow. Consequently, whether depletion of TAF73 causes a cell cycle phenotype remains to be determined. We next examined whether overexpression of TAF72 suppresses Δtaf73. Thetaf73 +/Δtaf73::ura4 +diploid strain was transformed with multicopy plasmids carrying thetaf72 + or taf73 + gene, sporulated, and subjected to tetrad analysis. As shown in TableI, tetrads with more than two viable spores were recovered from the diploid carrying thetaf73 + plasmid, but not from the diploid carrying the taf72 + plasmid, indicating that overexpression of TAF72 did not suppress Δtaf73. Thus, TAF72 cannot substitute for TAF73. To detect TAF72 and TAF73 proteins, we constructed S. pombestrains expressing FLAG-tagged TAF72 or TAF73, in which the wild-type gene on the chromosome was replaced by a gene encoding the epitope-tagged protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). Whole-cell extracts were prepared from these strains, along with wild-type strain JY741, which did not express any FLAG-tagged protein. Immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody detected FLAG-TAF72 and FLAG-TAF73 proteins, which were absent from the extract of the wild-type strain (data not shown). FLAG-TAF72 and FLAG-TAF73 migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel with apparent molecular masses of ∼75 and ∼80 kDa, respectively. We next examined whether TAF72 and TAF73 are associated with TBP. The whole-cell extracts of the strains expressing FLAG-TAF72 or FLAG-TAF73 were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoblotting with anti-S. pombe TBP antibody revealed that TBP was co-immunoprecipitated with TAF72 and TAF73 (Fig.6 A, lanes 2 and3). TBP was no"

The enzyme functions as a homodimer and requires pyridoxal 5′-phosphate as a cofactor. Although the roles of defined amino acids in the active site and catalytic mechanism have been recently explored using site-directed mutagenesis, much less is known about the role of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase polypeptide chain arrangement in folding, structure, and ultimately, function. To assess the importance of the continuity of the polypeptide chain, circularly permuted 5-aminolevulinate synthase variants were constructed through either rational design or screening of an engineered random library. One percent of the random library clones were active, and a total of 21 active variants had sequences different from that of the wild type 5-aminolevulinate synthase. Out of these 21 variants, 9 displayed unique circular permutations of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase polypeptide chain. The new termini of the active variants disrupted secondary structure elements and loop regions and fell in 100 amino acid regions from each terminus. This indicates that the natural continuity of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase polypeptide chain and the sequential arrangement of the secondary structure elements are not requirements for proper folding, binding of the cofactor, or assembly of the two subunits. Furthermore, the order of two identified functional elements (i.e. the catalytic and the glycine-binding domains) is apparently irrelevant for proper functioning of the enzyme. Although the wild type 5-aminolevulinate synthase and the circularly permuted variants appear to have similar, predicted overall tertiary structures, they exhibit differences in the arrangement of the secondary structure elements and in the cofactor-binding site environment. Taken together, the data lead us to propose that the 5-aminolevulinate synthase overall structure can be reached through multiple or alternative folding pathways. 5-Aminolevulinate synthase is the first enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway in non-plant eukaryotes and some prokaryotes.

This is the first and the major regulatory reaction in the heme biosynthetic pathway in non-plant eukaryotes and the α-subclass of purple bacteria (1Ferreira G.C. Gong J. J. Bioenerg.

Mammals encode two distinct ALAS isoforms, housekeeping ALAS and erythroid-specific ALAS isoform; the latter is only expressed in developing erythrocytes (3Sadlon T.J. Dell'Oso T. Surinya K.H.

The gene encoding the human erythroid ALAS has been localized on the band Xp11.21 of the X chromosome (5Cotter P.D. Willard H.F. Gorski J.L. Bishop D.F. Genomics. 1992; 13: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas the gene for the human housekeeping ALAS has been assigned to the band 3p21 of chromosome 3 (6Bishop D.F.

Lee G.R. Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1999: 1022-1045Google Scholar). Murine erythroid ALAS functions as a homodimer, with the active site residing at the subunit interface (11Tan D. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8934-8941Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and requires pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) as an essential cofactor (2Ferreira G.C. Ferreira G.C. Moura J.J.G. Franco R. Inorganic Biochemistry and Regulatory Mechanisms of Iron Metabolism. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1999: 15-34Google Scholar). In murine erythroid ALAS, the PLP cofactor is covalently bound to the Lys-313 residue through a Schiff base linkage, forming the cofactor-protein complex termed internal aldimine (12Ferreira G.C. Neame P.J. Dailey H.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, the conserved Lys-313 residue was reported to have a catalytic role (13Ferreira G.C. Vajapey U. Hafez O. Hunter G.A. Barber M.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1001-1006PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3711-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic analysis of the ALAS-catalyzed reaction indicated an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism, in which glycine binds before succinyl-CoA and ALA is dissociated from the enzyme last (15Fanica-Gaignier M. Clement-Metral J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 40: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The chemical mechanism of the ALAS reaction appears to be similar to that of other PLP-dependent enzymes catalyzing reactions involving amino acids (16John R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 17Ferreira G.C. Iriarte A. Kagan H.M. Martinez-Carrion M.M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Vitamin B6 and PQQ-dependent Proteins. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel2000: 257-263Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the binding of glycine leads to the formation of the PLP-glycine complex termed external aldimine, which upon removal of the pro-R proton of glycine yields a resonance-stabilized quinonoid intermediate. Subsequently, this intermediate reacts with the second substrate succinyl-CoA forming a putative α-amino-β-ketoadipate aldimine (14Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3711-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The next steps involve the decarboxylation of the glycine-derived carboxyl group and formation of an aldimine to ALA. The release of ALA, or a protein conformation change associated with it, was suggested to be the rate-limiting step of the ALAS-catalyzed reaction (18Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12222-12228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the three-dimensional structure of ALAS has yet to be determined, the evolutionary proximity between ALAS and other members of the α-family of PLP-dependent enzymes of known three-dimensional structure made it possible to perform homology modeling studies of ALAS structure and function (17Ferreira G.C. Iriarte A. Kagan H.M. Martinez-Carrion M.M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Vitamin B6 and PQQ-dependent Proteins. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel2000: 257-263Crossref Google Scholar). The Arg-439 residue is involved in the binding of glycine by forming a salt bridge with its negatively charged α-carboxylate group (19Tan D. Harrison T. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Asp-279 residue appears to be positioned close to the pyridinium ring nitrogen of the PLP cofactor. Its negatively charged carboxylate group stabilizes the protonated form of the ring nitrogen, thus enhancing the electron sink capacity of the PLP cofactor (20Gong J. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tyr-121 has been shown to be involved in PLP cofactor binding by donating a hydrogen bond from its hydroxyl group to the phosphate oxygen of the PLP cofactor (21Tan D. Barber M.J. Ferreira G.C.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1208-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), much less is known about the role of the ALAS polypeptide chain arrangement in folding, final structure, and catalysis. Circular permutation, which disrupts the continuity of the polypeptide chain by placing the original N and C termini at new locations, has proved to be a valuable tool for studying the effects of polypeptide chain rearrangements on catalytic activity and folding of proteins (22Zhang T. Bertelsen E. Benvegnu D. Alber T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12311-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Nakamura T. Iwakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With circular permutation of proteins, the natural N and C termini are covalently linked, and new termini are created upon cleavage of the circularized protein at a different sequence position (24Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 25Rote K.V. Hough R. Goldenberg D. Rechsteiner M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1156-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The result is a change in the primary (i.e. order of the amino acid sequence), secondary, and possibly tertiary structures (24Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Uversky V.N. Kutyshenko V.P. Protasova N. Rogov V.V. Vassilenko K.S. Gudkov A.T. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1844-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To date, the circular permutation approach has been successfully applied to more than 20 proteins. These include, for example, T4 lysozyme (22Zhang T. Bertelsen E. Benvegnu D. Alber T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12311-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), aspartate transcarbamoylase (27Graf R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1844-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Circularly permuted variants have been constructed either by engineering recombinant variants with N and C termini at selected locations (23Nakamura T. Iwakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Uversky V.N. Kutyshenko V.P. Protasova N. Rogov V.V. Vassilenko K.S. Gudkov A.T.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1290-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or by randomly generating new termini (27Graf R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11591-11596Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Hennecke J. Sebbel P. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1197-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, circularly permuted chains have been generated with protein chemical modification methods involving the covalent linkage of the N and C termini, followed by hydrolysis of a single polypeptide bond at a different position from that of the linked original termini (24Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The folding of the circularly permuted variants into functional proteins indicated that these variants can achieve a proper conformation for function and suggested that the amino acid sequence, and not the positioning of the N and C termini, determines the three-dimensional structure (28Hennecke J. Sebbel P. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1197-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Gutknecht R. Manni M. Mao Q. Erni B. J. Biol.

Importantly, the identification of “functional elements,”; which have been defined as the smallest continuous sequences required for catalytic activity (23Nakamura T. Iwakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), makes possible the exploration of the “architecture of enzyme function.”; These functional elements, which are spread throughout the primary structure, define the functional active site in a properly folded enzyme (23Nakamura T. Iwakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we analyze the role of the ALAS polypeptide chain in relation to folding and assembly of the holoenzyme. We report that the circular permutation of the ALAS polypeptide chain affects neither the folding/assembly of the ALAS subunits into the dimeric holoprotein nor the activity of the enzyme. The stable and active circularly permuted ALAS variants, however, appear to have different topologies.

The Escherichia coli strain HU227 (32Li J.M. Brathwaite O. Cosloy S.D. Russell C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2547-2552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. C. S. Russell (City University of New York), and the E. coli strain LC24 (33Huala E. Moon A.L. Ausubel F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 382-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The pAC9 plasmid was used as the vector plasmid in the construction of the random library of circularly permuted ALAS variants. pAC9 contains the sequence for stop codons in the three possible reading frames and for three restriction enzyme sites (SalI, Ecl136 II, andBamHI). The Ecl136 II site was engineered so that the blunt 5′ and 3′ ends of the insert encoding the circularly permuted ALAS variants would be in frame with the ATG codon (located upstream of the SalI site (34Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and the first TAA of three stop codons sequence, respectively. Two additional nucleotides (downstream of the first TAA) were also included to generate the two other reading frames and, thus, to accommodate inserts that would not be in the same reading frame as the first TAA codon (Fig. 1). The cassette containing the sequences for the three stop codons and the three restriction enzyme sites was constructed by annealing two phosphorylated oligonucleotides (STOP1, 5′-TCGACAGAGCTCTAAATAAATAAG-3′, and rSTOP2, 5′-GATCCTTATTTATTTAGAGCTCTG-3′). Upon phosphorylation and annealing, the oligonucleotides were subcloned into pGF23 expression vector (34Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously digested with SalI andBamHI (Fig. 1). Competent E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligated DNA by electroporation. The screening for the correct construct was performed by DNA sequencing according to dideoxy chain termination method (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The pAC10 plasmid was used to produce sufficient amounts of ALAS cDNA fragment with engineeredSalI sites at 5′ and 3′ ends. The SalI sites were engineered such that, upon circularization of the ALAS cDNA piece, the original ALAS reading frame would be maintained. The ALAS cDNA fragment with engineered SalI sites was obtained by PCR using pGF23 plasmid as a template (34Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into pGF23 vector, previously digested with SalI. The experimental design entailed several modifications of the method developed by Graf and Schachman (27Graf R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11591-11596Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). Briefly, a cDNA fragment encoding the murine erythroid ALAS with engineered SalI sites at both the 5′ and 3′ ends was obtained by digestion of the pAC10 plasmid with SalI, followed by gel purification. The circularization was accomplished in a final volume reaction of 50 μl using T4 DNA ligase (8.0 units/μl) and 11 μg of DNA in ligase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmATP, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Efficiency of the ligation reaction was estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Upon heat inactivation of ligase, RQ1 DNase was added at a ratio of 0.002 units per μg of DNA, and the samples were incubated for 15 min at 16 °C. The samples were pooled, and the DNA was recovered by phenol extraction. The generated, linearized inserts were repaired, blunt-ended with Klenow DNA polymerase I fragment, and subcloned into pAC9 vector (Fig. 1) previously digested with Ecl136 II. Competent E. coli HU227 cells, which can only grow in a medium containing ALA or when harboring an ALAS expression plasmid, were transformed with the ligation reaction by electroporation. One-eighth of the transformation solution was plated onto permissive 2× YT-agar medium (1.6% bacto-tryptone, 1% bacto-yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 1.5% agar) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml ALA, to score the total number of colonies produced. The remaining transformation solution was plated onto selective 2× YT-agar medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, to select only for active ALAS variants. DNA sequencing templates were prepared from colonies recovered on the selective medium, and the DNA sequences of the 5′ and 3′ ends of the fragments encoding the functional circularly permuted variants were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The repair of staggered ends created after DNase I treatment can lead to the deletion or insertion of nucleotides, which consequently can yield extra amino acids, and thus non-perfectly permuted polypeptide chains (27Graf R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11591-11596Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To correct the 5′ and 3′ ends, the fragments encoding these variants were PCR-amplified using primers coding for the expected 5′ and 3′ sequences. The PfuTurbo DNA polymerase was used to minimize nonspecific incorporation of nucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified inserts, and the PCR conditions were according to the manufacturer's instructions. The obtained inserts were ligated into pAC9 vector, previously digested with Ecl136 II. Competent E. coli HU227 cells were transformed with the ligation, and the 5′ and 3′ end insert sequences of the functional rescued variants were verified by dideoxy DNA sequencing (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Two ALAS cDNAs were ligated in tandem and in the original reading frame, using an ALAS expression plasmid, pGF23 (34Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as the DNA template for two PCRs. In PCR1, the 5′ primer (NALAS-6, 5′-GCATATGTCGACTGACAGGAAGAGCAAGATTG-3′) contains the sequences for the first six amino acids of the mature ALAS and for a SalI site (sequence for SalI site is underlined) and the 3′ primer (RALAS-75, 5′-AGCTCAATTGAGCATAGGTGGTAAC-3′) contains the sequences for the terminal six amino acids and for an MfeI site (sequence for MfeI site is underlined). In PCR2, the 5′ primer (MALAS-76, 5′-TGCTCAATTGGACAGGAAGAGCAAG-3′) contains the sequences for the first six amino acids of the mature ALAS and for anMfeI site (sequence for MfeI site is underlined), and the 3′ primer (CALAS-7, 5′-GCAGCTGGATCCTTAAGCATAGGTGGTAACAT-3′) contains the sequences for the terminal six amino acids and for a BamHI site (sequence for BamHI site is underlined). The purified PCR1 product was digested with SalI and MfeI, whereas the purified PCR2 was digested with BamHI andMfeI. The digested PCR products were then ligated into pGF23 previously digested with SalI and BamHI. The generated plasmid, pAC1, encoding the two ALAS cDNAs in tandem was subsequently used as the PCR template in the construction of circularly permuted variants of designed N and C termini. The 5′ and 3′ primers were 5′-TATAGTCGACTGCTGCATGCAACTTCTGTA-3′ and 5′-TATAGGATCCTTACACAGACACATCTTGGAA-3′, respectively, for A475 variant; 5′-TATAGTCGACTATGGAAAACTTTGTGGAGA-3′ and 5′-TATAGGATCCTTACATCTGAGGGCTGTGAAA-3′, respectively, for M451 variant; 5′-TATAGTCGACTTCTGGGGCTCTAGAATCTA-3′ and 5′-TATAGGATCCTTAGAGCATCATGGGAGGCAG-3′, respectively, for S351 variant; 5′-TATAGTCGACTCAGTATGGAGCCCTGACCT-3′ and 5′-TATAGGATCCTTAGTGGGCCACATCACACAA-3′, respectively, for Q271 variant; 5′-TATAGTCGACTAAGTTTCATGTGGAGCTT-3′ and 5′-TATAGGATCCTTAGCTGGTACCTGAGATATT-3′, respectively, for K156 variant; and 5′-GCATATGTCGACTGGTTATGACCAATTTTTCA-3′ and 5′-TATAGGATCCTTAGAAAGCCTGGCTTCCAGT-3′, respectively, for Y167 variant. Recombinant wild type and circularly permuted ALAS variants were purified from E. coli overproducing cells containing the ALAS-encoding cDNAs under the control of the alkaline phosphatase (pho A) promoter (34Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells harboring the expression plasmids for Q69, N404, and N408 ALAS variants or E. coli strain LC24 cells (33Huala E. Moon A.L. Ausubel F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 382-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring the expression plasmid for L25 were grown in MOPS medium and harvested as described previously (34Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell pellets were resuspended as in Ref. 34Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, with the exception of the pellet corresponding to the BL21(DE3) cells harboring the N404 variant, which was resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm PLP, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, and the following protease inhibitors: 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The steps following cell lysis and centrifugation were essentially as described in Ref. 34Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar with slight modifications. Specifically, the initial ammonium sulfate fractionation step was 20% for the Q69 variant, 25% for the N408 and L25 variants, and 28% for the N404 variant. After stirring for 10 min at 4 °C, the solution was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further fractionated with ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 30% (in the case of L25 and Q69 variants) or 38% (in the case of N408 and N404 variants). The chromatographic steps using an Ultrogel AcA and DEAE-Sephacel columns were as described previously (34Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications: the DEAE-Sephacel resin was washed with Buffer A until A 280 was lower than 0.1 and the protein of interest (i.e. wild type or circularly permuted ALAS variants) was eluted with Buffer A (34Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 60 mm KCl. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon 8050 stirred cell with an YM30 membrane. The purified and concentrated enzyme (wild type or variants) was stored under liquid nitrogen. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay, according to the instructions supplied with the protein concentration determination kit, and using bovine serum albumin as standard. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of the rationally designed ALAS variants was verified using native PAGE (37Gabriel D. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 568-578Google Scholar). The protein samples were prepared from E. coli cells, harboring the different expression plasmids, which were induced for protein expression and grown for 16 h at 37 °C (34Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed using sonication, and the cell membranes were pelleted. Most of the supernatant protein was precipitated by addition of a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 50%. The precipitated protein was resuspended in 300 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 15% glycerol. The resuspended protein was desalted using Bio-Rad Bio-Spin 6 gel filtration columns, and ∼30 μg of the desalted protein samples were loaded onto the gel. The native molecular masses of ALAS variants were determined by"
https://openalex.org/W2141062639,"By taking advantage of the extreme stability of a protein-DNA complex, we have obtained two highly specific monoclonal antibodies against a predetermined palindromic DNA sequence corresponding to the binding site of the E2 transcriptional regulator of the human papillomavirus (HPV-16). The purified univalent antibody fragments bind to a double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the E2 binding site in solution with dissociation constants in the low and subnanomolar range. This affinity matches that of the natural DNA binding domain and is severalfold higher than the affinity of a homologous bovine E2 C-terminal domain (BPV-1) for the same DNA. These antibodies discriminate effectively among a number of double- and single-stranded synthetic DNAs with factors ranging from 125- to 20,000-fold the dissociation constant of the specific DNA sequence used in the immunogenic protein-DNA complex. Moreover, they are capable of fine specificity tuning, since they both bind less tightly to another HPV-16 E2 binding site, differing in only 1 base pair in a noncontact flexible region. Beyond the relevance of obtaining a specific anti-DNA response, these results provide a first glance at how DNA as an antigen is recognized specifically by an antibody. The accuracy of the spectroscopic method used for the binding analysis suggests that a detailed mechanistic analysis is attainable.

The accuracy of the spectroscopic method used for the binding analysis suggests that a detailed mechanistic analysis is attainable. Unveiling the molecular rules for protein-DNA recognition is a necessary step for the understanding of gene function and regulation. A large number of proteins and cognate DNA sequences displaying a large variety of natural structures and recognition modes have been and are being identified as involved in physiological and pathological mechanisms (1Travers A. Travers A. DNA-protein Interactions. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 375-441Google Scholar, 2Blackburn G.M. Gait M.J. Nucleic Acids in Chemistry and Biology. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). In addition, the ability to design new DNA binding activities constitutes a major scientific challenge with technological applications such as control of gene function, gene therapy, genome research, and diagnostics.Antibodies that bind to DNA are a hallmark of the autoimmune disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (3Stollar B.D. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but these are not specific to particular sequences of single- or double-stranded DNA, or at least the putative specific sequences that elicit them have not been yet identified. Although a number of natural anti-DNA antibodies have been described, DNA is known to be a poor immunogen (4Stollar B.D. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 20: 1-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and it has been virtually impossible to generate antibodies against a specific DNA sequence to date. DNA binding antibodies were obtained using phage display technology, but these bound to repetitive, nonspecific sequences (5Barbas S.M. Ghazal P. Barbas III, C.F. Burton D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 2161-2162Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A chimeric sequence-specific DNA binding antibody was engineered by incorporating the DNA binding domain of a transcription factor into the CDR3 of the heavy chain (HCDR3) from a recombinant Fab molecule (6LeBlanc J.F. McLane K.E. Parren P.W. Burton D.R. Ghazal P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6015-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This elegant engineering approach can be further exploited through antibody display in phage, but it cannot take advantage of the natural diversity of antibody repertoires. Other approaches for obtaining novel DNA binding activities arise from the combination of phage display technology in a zinc finger framework (7Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2256-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar); some of these chimeras bind DNA in the low nanomolar range as judged by electrophoretic methods (8Greisman H.A. Pabo C.O. Science. 1997; 275: 357-661Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar). A major goal for generating sequence specific anti-DNA activities is the intracellular expression of the resulting protein for control of gene function (9Rondon I.J. Marasco W.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 57: 257-283Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Can antibodies be raised against specific and predetermined DNA sequences? If so, how might such antibodies interact with the DNA compared with natural DNA binders? In an attempt to answer these questions, we used a natural protein-DNA complex, the DNA binding domain of the human papillomavirus E2 protein (E2C) bound to its target DNA (10McBride A. Romanczuk H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18411-18414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as immunogen. This domain shows a particular dimeric β-barrel topology consisting of an eight-stranded (four per subunit) β-barrel, with major DNA binding and minor α-helices, packed against opposite sides of the barrel (11Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Based on the large stability of the E2C-DNA complex (12Lima L.M. Prat-Gay G.de J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19295-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we used it as the antigen to produce a specific anti-DNA response against this key viral regulatory DNA binding site. We characterize two newly obtained sequence-specific anti-DNA antibodies (a-DNAbs) 1The abbreviations used are: a-DNAb(s)anti-DNA antibodie(s)bpbase pair(s)ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayMOPSmorpholinepropanesulfonic acidEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayBSAbovine serum albuminFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate using an accurate spectroscopic method in solution.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnti-DNA Monoclonal AntibodiesThe C-terminal DNA binding domain of the E2 protein from human papillomavirus strain-16 was expressed in BL21-DE3 Escherichia coli cells as described previously (13Mok Y.K. Bycroft M. Prat-Gay G.de Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The sequence of the A chain of the synthetic oligonucleotide is 5′-GTAACCGAAATCGGTTGA-3′, corresponding to E2 site 35 in the HPV-16 genome, where the underlined sequence indicates the consensus E2 binding site. A protein-DNA complex was formed by mixing E2C and DNA at a 1:1 ratio. Details of the immunization will be described elsewhere. Briefly, BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 25 μg of protein-DNA 1:1 complex emulsified in MPL® + TDM Adjuvant System (Sigma). Second and third boosters were administered intraperitoneally at 20-day intervals using similar doses. The immune response elicited was monitored by indirect ELISA using the 18-bp oligonucleotide and the protein-DNA complexes as antigens, as described below. Final boosting involved an intraperitoneal injection of 20 μg of protein-DNA 1:1 complex dissolved in TBS (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) 4 days prior to the somatic cell hybridization. Spleenocytes obtained from the immunized mouse with the highest anti-DNA titer were fused with a NSO mouse plasmacytoma cell line following established techniques (14Galfré G.A. Milstein C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 3-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). For the selection of anti-DNA antibodies we used the site 35 double-stranded oligonucleotide as antigen (1 μg/well in TBS). Of 92 culture supernatants screened after the fusion, eight displayed anti-site 35 DNA reactivity. Two hybridomas producing anti-DNA monoclonal antibodies (ED-10 and ED-84) were expanded and isotyped as IgG1 by ELISA. Ascites fluids were produced and IgGs and their derived Fab fragments prepared following standard procedures (15Goldbaum F.A. Cauerhff A. Velikovsky C.A. Llera A.S. Riottot M. Poljak R.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6040-6045PubMed Google Scholar). An additional gel chromatography step was included to ensure that only univalent and highly purified Fab fragments were present. The variable regions of both antibodies were cloned (16Dattamajumdar A.K. Jacobson D.P. Hood L.E. Osman G.E. Immunogenetics. 1996; 43: 141-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and according to their VH sequences, they belong to the J558 superfamily, shared by several pathogenic autoimmune anti-DNA antibodies (17Payelle-Brogard B. Ragimbeau J. Avrameas S. Christodoulou C. Hybridoma. 1998; 17: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B).Electrophoretic Mobility AssaysA site 35 DNA solution of 3 μm was incubated with the different proteins at different ratios, and the concentrations were determined from the respective molar extinction coefficients. A 6% acrylamide native gel was run in 0.1 m MOPS/Imidazol, pH 6.5, at 5 V cm−1 and the bands visualized by standard ethidium bromide staining. Overall, the EMSA experiments in our simplified buffer conditions (0.2 m NaCl, 25 mmBis-Tris HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol for loading) appear to be dissociating, and relative affinities cannot be inferred from these type of experiments (18Ferreiro D.U. Lima L.M.T.R. Alonso L.G. Goldbaum F.A. Prat-Gay G.de Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14692-14701Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).Quantitative ELISA BindingA quantitative ELISA assay for the determination of the KD was carried out as described previously (19Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohianiance L. Goldberg M.E. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with streptavidin (1 μg/well in TBS) for 60 min. After blocking with 1% BSA in TBS (BSA/TBS), 5 ng/well of a 5′-biotinylated site 35 DNA in BSA/TBS was added to the plate and further incubated for 15 min. ED-10 or ED-84 IgGs were incubated at 0.8 nm concentration with different concentrations of site 35 oligonucleotide solution in BSA/TBS. The 300-μl sample was incubated in microcentrifuge tubes for 30 min at room temperature. The entire mixture was transferred to the biotinylated DNA-coated ELISA plates for 60 min and subsequently washed three times with TBS. The retention of a-DNAb IgGs in the solid phase, representing the degree of binding to the biotinylated specific DNA, was developed using an anti-IgG peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibody. For each separate tube, the same mixture was incubated in the absence of biotinylated oligonucleotide as a blank. The resultingA at 492 nm value was used to calculate the antibody bound fraction, υ. The data were linearized according to Klotz: 1/υversus 1/Ag concentration (19Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohianiance L. Goldberg M.E. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). KD values were obtained from the slope of the plot.Fluorescence Binding ExperimentsFluorescence spectra were carried out using an Aminco Bowman Series 2 instrument. Excitation wavelength was fixed at 295 nm and the emission registered from 310 to 410 nm. Buffer base lines were subtracted. Tryptophan fluorescence titrations were carried out with excitation at 295 nm, monitoring the emission at 340 nm. The proteins were incubated in TBS in 3.0 ml volumes at 25 ± 0.1 °C, with protein concentration ranging from 5 to 100 nm, depending on the sequence used (see TableI and Fig. 4). DNA oligonucleotides were gradually added, and the tryptophan fluorescence was measured after 5 min equilibration at each point. The maximum dilution was 10%, and the fluorescence was corrected accordingly. The data were fitted to a simple binding model where both protein and DNA concentrations are considered (20Prat-Gay G.de Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1957-7963Google Scholar).Table ISequence discrimination and affinity of a-DNAbs ED-10 and ED-84DNAED-10ED-84KDD 1-aThe discrimination factor is the ratio KD, non-specific/KD, site 35–18.ΔΔG 1-bΔG = −RT ln K; ΔΔG = ΔGsite 35–18 − ΔGDNAx.KDDΔΔGnmkcal mol−1nmkcal mol−1dsDNA1-cSee legend of Figure 4A for details.Site 35–18 bp0.73 ± 0.07102.52 ± 0.3810Site 35–26 bp6.7 ± 0.79.11.34.9 ± 0.72.00.4Site 35–18 bp-P13.7 ± 1.1191.7122 ± 11482.3Site 7450–18 bp2.1 ± 1.12.90.65.6 ± 1.62.20.57450–36 bp-FITC5.7 ± 1.67.81.23.31 ± 1.81.30.2ARC158 ± 0.32173.1344 ± 0.61362.9CRE208 ± 0.22853.2316 ± 0.31252.8EBNA973 ± 15013334.21,200 ± 1534763.6VHmouse1-dThis DNA displayed a very low affinity interaction, too difficult to fit to a single binding event.1,526 ± 2446053.8HPV-16 2300265 ± 0.33623.4444 ± 0.41762.5ssDNASite 3515,100 ± 8757205615.87,570 ± 232730044.7ARC895 ± 10912264.22,957 ± 75711734.2HPV-16 2300579 ± 0.77943.91,074 ± 1454263.6The dissociation constants were determined as described in the legend to Fig. 3 C.1-a The discrimination factor is the ratio KD, non-specific/KD, site 35–18.1-b ΔG = −RT ln K; ΔΔG = ΔGsite 35–18 − ΔGDNAx.1-c See legend of Figure 4A for details.1-d This DNA displayed a very low affinity interaction, too difficult to fit to a single binding event.

We focused our studies on two selected a-DNAbs, ED-10 and ED-84, which showed reactivity in ELISA assays toward the HPV-16 site 35 double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide either free or bound to the HPV-16 E2C domain (Fig. 1 A). These antibodies also recognize the DNA when bound to the bovine (BPV-1) E2C domain.We cloned the variable regions of the two a-DNAbs antibodies, and the amino acid sequence analysis indicates hypermutation in the VH domains. In addition, the surprisingly identical CDR3s of the VH domain suggest a strong antigen-driven selection (Fig. 1 B). These CDR3s show no sequence homology to any antibody described in data banks. Contrary to previously reported for germ line gene J558-derived anti-DNA antibodies, there is not an evident predominance of positively charged residues in the a-DNAbs as the main source for binding affinity as discussed elsewhere (21Krishnan M.R. Jou N. Marion T.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2430-2439PubMed Google Scholar). Both a-DNAbs have different VL chains, explaining at least in part the fine differences in specificity.Analysis of DNA Binding by the AntibodiesThe interaction of the a-DNAbs with the E2 site 35 oligonucleotide was preliminary analyzed by an EMSA. No shift, and therefore no detectable binding, appeared when the EMSA was performed using a radioactively phosphorylated oligonucleotide (not shown). Thus, we used an unmodified oligonucleotide and developed the bands using ethidium bromide staining. Fig. 2 A shows the result of such a binding experiment where the two Fabs, ED-10 and ED-84, produced a band shift as expected from the initial ELISA assays. The absence of a band shift using radioactively phosphorylated oligonucleotide strongly suggest that DNA binding by both antibodies is sensitive to the phosphorylation at the 5′ terminus of the oligonucleotide (see below). Incremental additions of a-DNAb to the free DNA produce a gradual band shift to the antibody-bound form as shown in Fig. 2 B. However, no reliable quantitative binding analysis would be possible (see “Materials and Methods”).Figure 2Binding of ED-10 and ED-84 to site 35 DNA. A, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Site 35 DNA at 3 μm (Free, first lane) was incubated with 4-fold either ED-10 (second lane) or ED-84 Fabs (third lane) for 30 min at room temperature as described under ‘Materials and Methods,‘ prior to gel loading.B, same as A. Site 35 DNA at 3 μmwas incubated with increasing amounts of a-DNAbs (0–12 μm). ED-10 was shown as an example. Running conditions and gel staining are explained under “Materials and Methods.”C, quantitative ELISA binding experiment. The binding of the a-DNAb IgGs (1.6 nm per site) to the DNA-coated plate was prevented by incubation with increasing amounts of free site 35 DNA, and the resulting optical density decrease is a measure of the binding (inset). The data were transformed and plotted as 1/υ against 1/Ag (Klotz), and the KD was obtained from the slope, after linear regression analysis (see “Materials and Methods”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The binding was quantitatively analyzed by competition ELISA in solution (19Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohianiance L. Goldberg M.E. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1997Google Scholar) and yield dissociation constants of 1.85 ± 0.05 and 1.69 ± 0.18 nm for ED-10 and ED-84, respectively (Fig. 2 C). This is the first strong indication that the affinity of both antibodies for the E2 site 35 DNA is very high. Nevertheless, we wanted to test a spectroscopic method that would confirm the tight binding and provide the highest accuracy in solution.The tryptophan fluorescence of the purified Fabs is quenched by 30–40% upon binding to the DNA oligonucleotide, depending on the antibody (Fig. 3 A). The DNA does not quench the spectrum of a control Fab that recognizes the E2C protein (Fig. 3 A). We carried out equilibrium titration experiments in solution monitored by tryptophan fluorescence. Titration of site 35 double-stranded DNA with ED-10 and ED-84 Fabs confirms high affinity-saturable binding and a clear 1:1 stoichiometry, as expected from univalent Fabs (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3DNA binding by fluorescence spectroscopy. A, fluorescence spectral change upon binding of DNA. Proteins were incubated at 2 μmconcentration in TBS buffer, pH 7.4, and the spectra were recorded prior and after addition of 2.5 μm site 35 DNA. The spectra of ED-84 Fab were shown as an example, no addition (open squares), plus DNA (closed squares). As a control, we used an anti-E2C Fab, ED-5: open circles, no addition;closed circles, plus DNA. B, a stoichiometric titration was carried out for both a-DNAbs (ED-10 shown in the figure), at 200 nm protein concentration, monitoring fluorescence upon addition of site 35 DNA, as described under “Materials and Methods.” C, the dissociation constants,KD, were determined in titration experiments at near-dissociation conditions. The figure shows the titration of ED-10 Fab, at 5 nm concentration. The data were fitted as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the residuals are shown (inset). The binding data of both antibodies to all the sequences tested are shown in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)For an accurate determination of the dissociation constants (KD) for DNA binding, we carried out tryptophan fluorescence binding experiments at near-dissociation conditions for both antibodies. A typical DNA binding experiment for ED-10 is shown in Fig. 3 C. Such analysis yielded dissociation constants of 0.73 ± 0.07 and 2.5 ± 0.4 nm for ED-10 and ED-84, respectively (Table I). The affinity of the same site 35 DNA oligonucleotide for the E2C domain, the natural partner, is 0.2 nm (18Ferreiro D.U. Lima L.M.T.R. Alonso L.G. Goldbaum F.A. Prat-Gay G.de Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14692-14701Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Sequence DiscriminationThe untranslated regulatory region of the HPV16 genome contains three similar, but not identical, high affinity E2 binding sites. To test whether our anti-site 35 DNA antibodies were capable of fine specificity tuning as the E2C domain, we analyzed the binding of the a-DNAbs to another natural E2 binding site, site 7450 (Fig. 4 A). Both antibodies are able to discriminate HPV-16 E2 site 7450 from site 35 with 2–3-fold lower affinity (Table I).In fluorescence binding experiments, phosphorylation of site 35-18 bp produced an increase in KD of 20- and 50-fold for ED-10 and ED-84 Fabs, respectively (Table I), in agreement with preliminary EMSA experiments using radioactively phosphorylated site 35. Since the phosphorylation at the 5′-OH affects the binding of the a-DNAbs to the 18-bp site, we tested a longer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the E2 site 35. Table I shows that a 26-mer (site 35-26 bp) still binds with high affinity, albeit lower than the 18-bp site by 1.3 and 0.4 kcal mol−1, respectively, for each a-DNAb. The binding appears to be weakened to a lesser extent when compared with phosphorylated site 35-18 bp. In addition, we analyzed the binding of the a-DNAbs to a 36-bp site containing the other natural E2 site (7450), with both 5′-OH ends modified with fluorescein (FITC). Using tryptophan fluorescence quenching, we determined that the binding affinities are marginally modified with respect to site 7450, marking a difference with the site 35 DNA, which was used as immunogen. FITC fluorescence intensity and anisotropy of site 7450-36 bp-FITC remain completely unchanged after addition of a-DNAbs (not shown), suggesting that in longer DNA stretches, the 5′-OH is not involved in recognition.We determined the binding properties of purified Fab fragments corresponding to both a-DNAbs to a set of different palindromic and nonpalindromic double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides of similar length (Fig. 4 A). The affinities for most sequences tested were markedly lower than the target sequence, with discrimination factors (KD, nonspecific/KD, site 35) ranging from 125 to 20,000 (Fig. 4 B and Table I). ED-84 binds with 3-fold less affinity for specific DNA, but binds to most nonspecific double- and single-stranded DNAs with higher affinity than ED-10. This suggests that the slightly lower affinity of ED-84 for the specific DNA could eventually be linked to a lower capacity of sequence discrimination ranging from 2- to 7-fold depending on the DNA sequence, evidenced in the ratio of discrimination factors (DED-10/DED-84, see legend for Table I).The discrimination factor for single-stranded site 35 DNA was 20,500 and 3,000 for ED-10 and ED-84, respectively. Binding affinity for two nonspecific single-stranded DNAs was noticeably higher, but since it is essentially a nonspecific interaction, we shall await detailed structural information to fully understand the molecular basis of this phenomenon. In any case, it should be pointed out that discrimination between single- and double-stranded DNA in natural antibodies found in autoimmune disease appears to be at the level of backbone recognition (22Radic M.Z. Weigert M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 487-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), i.e. conformational, while the type of interaction we are now describing is sequence-specific.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that it is possible to generate antibodies against a desired and predetermined double-stranded DNA sequence. The strong anti-DNA response generated could be the result of the high stability of the protein-DNA complex conferring a longer lifetime to the DNA, possibly enhanced by the high immunogenicity of the E2C protein. Further analysis of the immune response to the E2C-DNA complex will be required to fully understand the process.The fluorescence spectroscopic method developed allowed us to evaluate the binding affinities with high accuracy and is therefore promising when aiming at a full characterization of the binding mechanism. Although the structural basis for this change cannot be unequivocally assigned, the HCDR3s contain a high proportion of aromatic residues as potential targets for fluorescence quenching. We have shown that a classical phosphorylation-based EMSA missed the binding event, as it was described for some protein-DNA interactions using filter assays (23Oehler S. Alex R. Barker A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The binding was physically confirmed by ELISA and ethidium bromide-stained EMSA, which underestimate the binding by at least 1 order of magnitude in our simplified assay conditions (Fig.2 B and see “Materials and Methods”).The monoclonal antibodies obtained display high specificity and affinity approaching that of the natural DNA binding domain E2C from the human infecting high risk strain, HPV-16, determined in our laboratory by spectroscopic methods to be 0.2 nm (18Ferreiro D.U. Lima L.M.T.R. Alonso L.G. Goldbaum F.A. Prat-Gay G.de Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14692-14701Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The affinity of the highly related bovine (BPV-1) E2C domain for the site 35 DNA oligonucleotide was recently determined in our laboratory in similar buffer conditions and was shown to be over 300-fold lower than the specific anti-site 35 DNA antibodies we now describe (18Ferreiro D.U. Lima L.M.T.R. Alonso L.G. Goldbaum F.A. Prat-Gay G.de Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14692-14701Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the a-DNAbs discriminate the HPV16 E2 binding site, 7450, from site 35, used to raise the antibodies. The two sites are almost identical, except for a single base change in a flexible noncontact region. These two results are a clear indication of the high affinity and sequence discrimination of the specific a-DNAbs we describe, even for a minimal change in sequence.The free 5′-OH in the specific oligonucleotide appears to participate in high affinity binding, but the difference in binding energies of phosphorylated species is well below the 3–5 kcal mol−1 difference observed for nonspecific sequences. Moreover, the a-DNAbs bind tightly to the specific sequence contained within longer DNA oligonucleotides and even to oligonucleotides with 5′-OH of both strands modified with FITC. Binding of a site 7450 oligonucleotide of 36 bp is as tight as the 18-bp site 7450, suggesting that modifications in the 5′-OH of shorter oligonucleotides would interfere with the binding. Without structural data, at this stage we can only speculate about the origin of the effect of 5′ phosphorylation, which could in part be that it is recognized by the a-DNAb, but possible effects on the DNA conformation or stability, particularly in an 18-bp palindrome, cannot be ruled out. This could also lead to slow conformational changes that might affect the binding at equilibrium. All the evidence accumulated so far strongly suggests that the major determinant for binding is still the DNA base sequence.The fact that the a-DNAbs specifically bind to the E2 site 35 DNA oligonucleotide does not imply that they recognize the E2 consensus sequence, i.e. ACCGN4CGGT, in the same manner as the viral domains. The a-DNAbs could well recognize part of the conserved consensus sequence and part of the flexible noncontact region, as the lower binding affinity for a related site suggests. Alternatively, they may recognize bases outside the consensus sequence of the synthetic site 35 DNA oligonucleotide. The precise sequence binding requirements will be mapped using a variety of synthetic oligonucleotides or hopefully uncovered by detailed structural analysis. The palindromic nature of this oligonucleotide suggests a possible duplex-hairpin equilibrium in solution, but more evidence is needed to ascertain the precise recognition motif.It is hardly possible that the DNA recognition mechanism by the a-DNAbs is similar to the natural DNA binding domain. The latter binds the DNA at the surface, conferring a substantial bent to it (11Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), while antibody binding sites frequently display large flat and extended surfaces or deep cavities (24Branden C. To"

After binding to the cell membrane in its monomeric form, the toxin first assembles into a heptameric pre-pore. Subsequently, the pre-pore transforms into the final pore by membrane insertion of an amphipathic β-barrel, which comprises the “central loop” domains of all heptamer subunits. The process of membrane insertion was analyzed here using a set of functionally altered toxin mutants. The results show that insertion may be initiated within an individual protomer when its NH2 terminus activates its central loop. The activated state is then shared with the central loops of the residual heptamer subunits, which results in cooperative membrane penetration. This cooperation of the central loops commences while these are still remote from the lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, it is subject to modulation by the target membrane, which therefore acts across a distance much like an allosteric effector. However, while allosteric transitions usually are reversible, membrane insertion of α-toxin is an irreversible event, and we show here that it can proceed to completion in a domino-like fashion when triggered by as little as a single foreign atom within the entire heptamer.

The molecule is secreted as a water-soluble monomer that binds to cytoplasmic membranes of eukaryotic target cells, where it subsequently forms transmembrane pores of heptameric stoichiometry (2Gouaux J.E.

In particular, when129YTRF was co-oligomerized on fibroblast membranes with a series of point mutants of α-toxin, hybrid heptamers were detected that were either fully active or entirely inactive depending on only one amino acid within a single subunit. A single amino acid residue may thus trigger membrane insertion of the entire α-toxin heptamer, whereby the NH2 terminus and the glycine-rich central loop cooperate both intra- and intermolecularly in an intricate fashion. The mutant 129YTRF was constructed by PCR mutagenesis according to Ref. 18Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 8.5.1-8.5.9Google Scholar using two mutagenic primers (coding sequence, GGT GAT ACA TAC ACG AGG TTC GGA AAA ATT GGC GGC C; complementary, TTT TCC GAA CCT CGT GTATGT ATC ATC ACC AGT AAC; the four italicized codons represent the insertion) and verified by DNA sequencing. The mutant gene was cloned into the shuttle plasmid pDU1212 for expression in Staphylococcus aureus DU1090 (19Fairweather N. Kennedy S. Foster T.J. Kehoe M. Dougan G. Infect. Immun. 1983; 41: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified from bacterial culture supernatants as described previously (20Palmer M. Jursch R. Weller U. Valeva A. Hilgert K. Kehoe M. Bhakdi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11959-11962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The various single cysteine mutants used in this study have been described before (4Valeva A. Weisser A. Walker B. Kehoe M. Bayley H. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Valeva A. Walev I. Pinkernell M. Walker B. Bayley H. Palmer M. Bhakdi S.

Acta. 1997; 1325: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The double mutant I5C/129YTRF was constructed by cleaving the respective pDU1212-derived, single mutant plasmids withKpnI and recombining the appropriate restriction fragments. Analogously, the cysteine mutant I5C/G130C was subcloned from the I5C and G130C single mutants. To achieve the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds with the latter mutant, the protein was transferred into phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) and supplemented with an equimolar amount of dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, disulfide bond formation was judged by SDS-PAGE1 performed in the absence of reducing agents. SDS-PAGE was carried out under standard conditions but with gels and running buffers not containing any disulfide reducing agents. Nondenaturing PAGE was carried out using sodium deoxycholate (10 mm) in a continuous buffer system (50 mm Tris, 50 mmglycine; no adjustment of pH). Oligomerization was analyzed on liposomes consisting of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine with cholesterol (molar fraction, 40%) and prepared by membrane extrusion according to Ref. 22Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar. Oligomer formation on fibroblasts was examined by Western blotting, which was carried out as described using a polyclonal rabbit-anti-α-toxin IgG antibody (23Bhakdi S. Muhly M. Fuessle R. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 318-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This experiment was done as described previously (11Valeva A. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13298-13304Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lytically active mutant K46C, thiol-specifically derivatized with fluorescein maleimide, was admixed with wild type toxin or129YTRF, respectively, at various ratios. The mixtures were incubated with liposomes to induce oligomerization, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and the fluorescein fluorescence was then assayed in a Spex Fluorimax fluorimeter (excitation wavelength, 488 nm; emission wavelength, 515 nm). 10 μg of the mutant D108C, thiol-specifically derivatized with fluorescein maleimide, were added to fibroblasts grown to confluence in one well of a six-well culture dish. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the supernatant was withdrawn, the cells washed with HBSS, and the cellular material recovered by solubilization with 3 ml of 0.5% SDS in HBSS. The sample was boiled for 5 min to ensure dissociation of the oligomers and fluorescein fluorescence quantified as above. Parallel samples were prepared with 10 μg of labeled K46C supplemented with 20 μg of either wild type hemolysin or 129YTRF, respectively. Hemolytic titration was carried out using rabbit erythrocytes (23Bhakdi S. Muhly M. Fuessle R. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 318-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with visual reading after 120 min. For assays involving retention of marker molecules within human fibroblasts, these were grown to confluence in 6 (K+)- or 96 (ATP)-well plates. The fibroblasts were washed with HBSS and then treated with the various toxin variants for 1 h at 37 °C; the wild type or mutant proteins used and their respective amounts are stated under “Results.” Following incubation, the supernatant was withdrawn, and the cells were washed once with HBSS. The cellular material was then recovered by lysis with Triton X-100 (Sigma; 1% in HBSS). Cellular ATP was assayed by luminometry, and cellular K+ was determined by flame photometry as described (24Walev I. Bhakdi S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereby control cells incubated in parallel without toxins served as standards. THP1 cells were treated analogously, except that they were grown and treated with the toxin in suspension; washing and recovery were performed by centrifugation. Four consecutive codons (YTRF: tyrosine, threonine, arginine, and phenylalanine) were inserted between residues Thr129 and Gly130 of α-toxin. The specific hemolytic activity of the ensuing mutant 129YTRF (as assayed with rabbit erythrocytes) corresponded to that of wild type toxin (data not shown). In contrast, when fibroblasts were treated with129YTRF, no release of cellular K+ or ATP occurred, whereas either marker was efficiently depleted by wild type toxin (Fig. 2 A). The129YTRF mutant thus did not detectably permeabilize the fibroblasts, although it readily formed oligomers on these cells (Fig.2 B). Similar results were also obtained with the lymphoid cell line THP1 (data not shown). In sum, 129YTRF may form either lytic or nonlytic oligomers, depending on the target membrane. To learn more about the functional properties of the129YTRF mutant, we examined its interaction wild type toxin. A constant amount of wild type toxin was admixed with129YTRF at various ratios, and the mixtures were applied to fibroblasts. Permeabilization of the cells was abolished when129YTRF was employed in at least 2-fold excess over wild type toxin (Fig. 3 A). This observed inhibition of wild type toxin by 129YTRF might conceivably be due to a competition of the two species for a limiting number of binding sites. The wild type toxin was therefore replaced with a fluorescein-labeled mutant (D108C) to facilitate the quantitation of the cell-bound active toxin. D108C indeed closely resembled wild type toxin in permeabilizing the fibroblasts in the absence but not in the presence of 129YTRF (data not shown). Nevertheless, the amount of labeled D108C that became bound to the fibroblasts was unaffected by 129YTRF (Fig.3 B), indicating that 129YTRF had not dislodged D108C from its binding sites. We therefore considered the possibility that the inhibitory effect of 129YTRF was due to the formation of hybrid oligomers with the active toxin. The ability of129YTRF to form hybrids with an active toxin species was confirmed using an experimental approach outlined previously (11Valeva A. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13298-13304Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The fluorescein derivative of another active cysteine mutant (K46C) exhibits pronounced self-quenching of fluorescence upon oligomerization. When admixed to the labeled K46C, 129YTRF was indistinguishable from wild type toxin in its ability to prevent this self-quenching effect, indicating that both had formed hybrid oligomers with K46C to the same extent. This strongly suggests that oligomerization of all toxin species in question occurred entirely at random. Then, the stoichiometry of the hybrid oligomers ensuing from a binary mixture should be binomially distributed. With a 2-fold excess of 129YTRF over wild type toxin, the fraction of homogeneous wild type oligomers will then be virtually nil (0.05%), whereas 6% of the oligomers will consist of 129YTRF only. The majority of the oligomers will thus represent hybrids of the two proteins of varying composition. The observed lack of permeabilization therefore indicates that, within these hybrids, 129YTRF suppresses the lytic activity of wild type toxin. This finding tallies with the previous concept of cooperative membrane insertion of the heptamer subunits (4Valeva A. Weisser A. Walker B. Kehoe M. Bayley H. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Valeva A. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13298-13304Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To characterize in more detail the cooperation among the subunits of the heptamer, we then tried to identify mutations that might complement the insertionally deficient phenotype of 129YTRF. To this end, we screened an existing collection of point mutants carrying unique cysteines substituted for various residues within the cysteine-less wild type α-toxin molecule (4Valeva A. Weisser A. Walker B. Kehoe M. Bayley H. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Valeva A. Walev I. Pinkernell M. Walker B. Bayley H. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11607-11611Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Valeva A. Pongs J. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Walker B. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23065-23071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). All these mutants were hemolytically active, and although they varied to some extent in their permeabilizing activity toward fibroblasts, they all effected a reduction of cellular ATP by at least 60% when employed at 10 μg/ml (data not shown). Accordingly, 10 μg/ml of each cysteine mutant in question was admixed with a 3-fold excess of 129YTRF and applied to fibroblasts, which were then assayed for cellular ATP. In most experiments, the fibroblasts retained ATP, so that the mutant proteins resembled wild type toxin in being inhibited by 129YTRF (Fig.4). However, the figure also shows that in several instances the cells had been permeabilized, indicating that these mutants had escaped inhibition by 129YTRF. Mutations of the latter type cluster in two regions: mutants S3C, I5C, I7C, and D13C are located at the far NH2 terminus, while substitutions D127C, D128C, T129C, G130C, and K131C are in immediate proximity to the insertional mutation of 129YTRF. They will collectively be referred to as breakthrough mutations in the following. The lacking inhibition of breakthrough mutants by 129YTRF might conceivably arise in two different ways: first, the mutants might simply escape capture by 129YTRF and oligomerize on their own; the lytic homogeneous oligomers of a breakthrough mutant would then co-exist on the cells with nonlytic 129YTRF oligomers. Second, the breakthrough mutants might form hybrid heptamers with129YTRF but then resist inhibition by the latter mutant, so that the hybrids (or a fraction thereof) would insert into the membrane and form a pore. Fig. 5 A shows an experiment to distinguish between these possibilities that was done with the breakthrough mutant G130C. Fibroblasts partially retain ATP when treated with this toxin at 5 μg/ml; at 2.5 μg/ml, ATP is nearly quantitatively retained. Strikingly, when the latter amounts of G130C were supplemented with the nonlytic 129YTRF mutant in excess, permeabilization was enhanced. This indicated that the two mutant proteins had readily formed hybrid oligomers that were lytically active. Similar results were also obtained with the mutants S3C, I5C, or D13C in place of G130C (data not shown). Thus, both the NH2-terminally and the centrally located breakthrough mutations permit co-assembly with 129YTRF and prevail over its functionally deficient phenotype within the hybrid heptamer. Nevertheless, Fig. 5 A also shows that, with 2.5 and even with 5 μg/ml G130C, supplementation with 129YTRF does not achieve the same level of permeabilization as observed with 10 μg/ml G130C alone, indicating that the toxin mixture does not live up to the specific activity of G130C. This behavior might suggest that, within the hybrid heptamer, the two toxin species govern the insertion process in a co-dominant fashion, so that only above a certain threshold number of G130C subunits (e.g. two or four) would these elicit membrane insertion of the entire heptamer. In this case, the breakthrough activity should be titratable with a sufficient excess of 129YTRF. We therefore employed a constant amount of G130C that was admixed with increasing amounts of129YTRF. Surprisingly, in this experiment, the permeabilizing efficacy of the toxin mixtures increased monotonously up to a 20-fold excess of 129YTRF (Fig. 5 B). At the latter ratio, virtually all of the G130C monomers will be singly incorporated into hybrid oligomers that otherwise are comprised of129YTRF subunits only. A single G130C subunit may therefore render a hybrid heptamer lytically active, and no threshold of subunit stoichiometry is apparent that would indicate a co-dominant control of membrane insertion of the hybrid heptamers. Another possibility that might be considered is that, within the hybrids, the breakthrough mutant molecules might insert on their own, while the 129-YTRF subunits would not; the partially inserted hybrid oligomer would then create a pore of reduced lytic capability. However, this assumption is at odds with the behavior of the same hybrid oligomers on a different cell type. The myeloid cell line THP-1, while readily susceptible to G130C or I5C alone, resists attack by mixtures of either mutant when admixed with 129YTRF (data not shown). Therefore, much like wild type toxin on fibroblasts, G130C or I5C are amenable to inhibition by 129YTRF, and they are thus not insertionally uncoupled. In sum, neither co-dominant control nor uncoupling of membrane insertion may account for the experimental findings, so that the observed reduction in activity of G130C/129YTRF hybrid heptamers as opposed to the homogeneous G130C ones heptamers remains unexplained. This issue will be further considered below (see “Discussion”). The existence of the NH2-terminal cluster of breakthrough mutations indicated that, in one way or the other, the amino terminus of a given subunit of the heptamer promotes membrane insertion of the central loop of a neighboring subunit. This stimulatory effect of the NH2 terminus might conceivably be transmitted along different routes that are schematically depicted in Fig. 6 A. First, the two molecular regions might be engaged in immediate interaction (as represented by the full arrow). Alternatively, the stimulatory effect might first be relayed to a corresponding elementin cis (long broken arrow) or in trans(short broken arrow). To distinguish between these possibilities, we combined the NH2-terminal breakthrough mutation I5C with 129YTRF to yield a double mutant, which then again was functionally characterized within homogeneous and hybrid heptamers. The results are summarized in Fig. 6, B–D. The double mutant I5C/129YTRF alone did not exhibit any permeabilization of fibroblasts, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis of an immediate effect of the NH2 terminus upon the central loop in trans (Fig. 6 B). The double mutant also failed to activate the 129YTRF single mutant within hybrid heptamers, which is at odds with the assumption that the NH2-terminal stimulus is first communicated in trans to a neighboring NH2 terminus and from there to the central loop in cis (Fig. 6 C). However, much like the 129YTRF single mutant, I5C/129YTRF was readily complemented when co-oligomerized with I5C (Fig. 5 D,upper panel). Moreover, the double mutant also inhibited the activity of wild type toxin within hybrid oligomers (Fig.5 D, lower panel). These two findings support the notion that the NH2 terminus primarily acts upon the central loop in cis, which then shares its state of activation with the other central loops within the heptamer. As discussed below, this concept is also compatible with previous data obtained with an NH2-terminal deletion mutant (Fig.6 E). The amino terminus is located remotely from the central loop within the heptamer (3Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar), but the two regions are likely to be in close proximity within the monomeric toxin molecule (cf. Fig. 1 A). Their close cooperation during membrane insertion suggests that this proximity be maintained in the pre-pore stage. To address this question more directly, a double cysteine mutant (I5C/G130C) was constructed. Fig.7 A shows that, in its monomeric form, this protein was readily converted to an intramolecular disulfide, the yield being around 50% in the experiment depicted. Subsequently, the mutant protein was no longer hemolytically active, and it failed to form SDS-resistant heptamers on membranes of model liposomes (Fig. 7 A). Interestingly, however, when the liposomes were solubilized and electrophoresed with the nondenaturing detergent deoxycholate, an oligomeric species was detected (Fig.7 B, lane 3). This oligomer migrated behind the one observed when the mutant protein was reduced prior to membrane binding (lane 4), but it could be reverted both to normal electrophoretic mobility and to SDS-resistance by post-treatment with dithiothreitol (Fig. 7, A and B, lanes 5). These results suggest that the NH2 terminus and the central loop indeed remain in close contact at an early stage of heptamer assembly. This contact probably is the structural basis of their close cooperation in the subsequent process of membrane insertion. The reduced electrophoretic mobility of the disulfide-bonded pre-pore heptamer might reflect its lack of a protruding β-barrel, which in case of the mature pore heptamer, confers additional electric charge by the binding of deoxycholate to its hydrophobic outer circumference (4Valeva A. Weisser A. Walker B. Kehoe M. Bayley H. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our findings also provide another example of the previous notion that the pre-pore stage may be further subdivided into several forms that, among other features, are distinguished by their susceptibility to dissociation by SDS (11Valeva A. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13298-13304Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). α-Toxin is an important model system for the molecular study of pore-forming proteins. Crystallization of the heptamer has provided the first high resolution structure of a bacterial toxin pore (3Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar), which has recently been complemented by the crystal structure of the homologous toxin leukocidin (lukF) in its monomeric state (6Olson R. Nariya H. Yokota K. Kamio Y. Gouaux E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Comparison of the two structures highlights the crucial roles of both the amino-terminal latch and the central glycine-rich loop in the conformational transition associated with pore formation (Fig. 1). In the monomer, the two segments are packed against the core of the molecule, contacting each other at their tips. In the oligomer, both have undergone a large move and now make long excursions from the core of the protomer. At the same time, they are in close contact with their respective counterparts of the neighboring subunits, the central loops now forming the transmembrane β-barrel that is crucial to toxin function. In addition to these structurally defined end points, intermediate stages have been characterized by mutational analysis that have outlined the way leading from the monomer to the final membrane-inserted oligomer. It has thereby become clear that, in the process of pore formation, oligomerization precedes membrane insertion (8Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Valeva A. Palmer M. Hilgert K. Kehoe M. Bhakdi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Insertion involves cooperation among neighboring protomers (4Valeva A. Weisser A. Walker B. Kehoe M. Bayley H. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1857-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,11Valeva A. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13298-13304Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite its various contacts within the monomeric and the oligomeric structures, respectively, the amino-terminal latch might conceivably contribute to membrane insertion through a variety of either intra- or intermolecular effects. The findings reported here now distinguish the essential role of the intramolecular effect the amino latch takes upon the central loop in cis. While this effect was observed here with individual (NH2-terminal breakthrough mutant) subunits within hybrid heptamers, it must be assumed to occur with all the subunits of an active (wild type) heptamer. This leads us to the notion that, in membrane insertion, the central loop receives dual activation both from the NH2 terminus in cis and from another central loop in trans. This model readily accommodates the second cluster of breakthrough mutations located within that loop, and it can also account for previous results obtained with an NH2-terminal deletion mutant (12Vandana S. Raje M. Krishnasastry M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24858-24863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The latter protein exhibits impaired hemolytic activity, which it also imparts on wild type toxin within hybrid heptamers (Fig. 6 E). Another important prerequisite for membrane insertion to be initiated is that the oligomer receives activation from the target lipid bilayer, a fact that is strikingly illustrated by the finding that polymorphonuclear granulocytes resist toxin attack by preventing membrane insertion of the pre-pore altogether (5Valeva A. Walev I. Pinkernell M. Walker B. Bayley H. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11607-11611Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The129YTRF phenotype now shows that this activation may be available to a different extent with various naturally susceptible membranes. The 129YTRF mutant is active on its own on rabbit erythrocytes, it is inactive and also inhibitory toward all active toxin species tested on THP-1 cells, and it is either inhibitory or subject to activation on fibroblasts. The insertion of129YTRF into fibroblast membranes triggered by breakthrough mutants exemplifies that, within an oligomer, individual protomers may transmit their activated state to neighboring subunits. On the other hand, the inhibitory action of 129YTRF shows that, despite available promotion by the membrane, a functional subunit may still fail to insert when in contact with drowsy neighbors. Therefore, in deciding on whether or not to proceed with membrane insertion, each subunit of the oligomer integrates signals received both from adjacent subunits and from the membrane. At what stage, then, does the membrane signal affect insertion of the central loop region? Consider a hybrid heptamer comprised of one wild type molecule and six molecules of129YTRF. This heptamer will readily insert into the rabbit erythrocyte membrane, but not so into the fibroblast membrane. However, by substituting one molecule of, e.g. I5C for the wild type subunit, insertion into the fibroblast membrane will be restored. The NH2-terminal mutation therefore compensates for the insufficient membrane stimulus, and it does so by directly acting upon the central loop in cis. It thus turns out that the membrane signal takes effect, while the central loop is still in contact with the NH2 terminus and, hence, remote from the target membrane. Taken together, the above considerations unveil a striking resemblance between membrane insertion of the α-toxin heptamer and the cooperative structural transition of an allosteric enzyme, which also senses signals from extraneous ligands, transmits them to the remotely located active site and integrates them among the subunits themselves. There remains, however, one important difference: while the reversibility of allosteric transitions is essential to their regulatory role in enzyme activity, membrane insertion of the α-toxin pore is an irreversible process. This irreversibility is strikingly highlighted by the fact that a single mutant residue within the entire heptamer may trigger insertion. Amazingly, in case of the breakthrough mutant S3C, such lytic hybrids differ from the corresponding nonlytic wild type/129YTRF hybrids by as little as a single sulfur atom replacing an oxygen. In a reversible system, such a small change should not effect much more than a slight shift of equilibrium; but, as we can see here, it may suffice to trigger an irreversible, self-sustaining reaction that proceeds to completion much like a toppling cascade of dominoes. Although the cellular acceptor sites for α-toxin still await molecular characterization, the limited number of toxin molecules found on the surface of target cells indicates that there is selectivity in toxin binding, and it also suggests that the toxin remains associated with the binding sites after oligomerization. From this, it would follow that, with different cells, these binding sites deliver a different degree of activation to the pre-pore heptamer that is on the verge of inserting. The question then arises whether or not, on a given cell, all binding sites are homogeneous. If they were not, their heterogeneity could account for the yet unexplained finding that the hybrid oligomers of G130C (as well as the other breakthrough mutants) and 129YTRF are less efficient in permeabilizing fibroblasts than those consisting of G130C only. Let us consider a single hybrid heptamer that is sitting on a fibroblast; n is the number of its G130C subunits. All subunits are randomly bound to either activating membrane sites or to nonactivating ones. One would then expect the membrane stimulus to take effect only at those activating sites that happen to carry a G130C subunit, while those sites carrying a 129YTRF subunit would be silenced. LetA be the fraction of activating sites and N the fraction of nonactivating ones; A + N = 1. Then, the probability of membrane insertion of the hybrid oligomer would equal 1 − N n, i.e. there would be a direct relationship between the fraction of G130C subunits and the readiness of an oligomer to achieve insertion. This would explain the reduced specific activity of G130C/129YTRF hybrids as opposed to homogeneous G130C oligomers. On the other hand, when n G130C subunits would be singly incorporated inton hybrid oligomers with 129YTRF, the probability that at least one of them was inserted would again be 1 −N n, but (with n > 1) there would be the additional chance that further oligomers would be inserted. This consideration would account for the enhancement of efficacy of G130C by its “titration” with increasing amounts of the nonlytic129YTRF species. In sum, the experimental findings are in line with the assumption that single cells may afford binding sites that support membrane insertion to different degrees. We speculate that this heterogeneity might be related to the lateral segregation of lipids in cell membranes. In conclusion, our study shows that membrane insertion of the α-toxin heptamer occurs in an intricately concerted manner resembling the allosteric transition of an oligomeric enzyme. It is restricted or promoted to a varying extent by different natural target membranes, whereby the molecular nature of the incremental cell membrane constituents remains to be elucidated. At the same time, membrane insertion is exceedingly susceptible to minimal changes of protein structure, which reflects the irreversible nature of the event of insertion. Ultimately, therefore, we are left with the question why a pore-forming toxin that, after oligomerization on the target membrane, is committed to an irreversible, one-hit mode of action is activated in a fashion similar to allosteric enzymes that must reversibly adjust to the prevailing metabolic situation."
https://openalex.org/W2142140280,"Laminin 5, the major keratinocyte adhesion ligand, is found in the lamina lucida subregion of the epidermal basement membrane of the skin, where it colocalizes with the anchoring filaments. Mutations in the genes encoding laminin 5 cause junctional epidermolysis bullosa, an inherited skin blistering disease characterized by abnormal hemidesmosomes and cleavage of the lamina lucida leading to epidermal detachment. In this work we describe the genetic basis of a new subtype of lethal inherited epidermolysis bullosa associated with reduced skin reactivity to laminin 5, presence of mature hemidesmosomes, and intradermal cleavage of the skin. The epidermolysis bullosa patients were heterozygous for a nonsense mutation (Q896X) and a splice site mutation (764−10T→G) in the gene (LAMC2) for the γ2 chain of laminin 5. The nonsense mutation causes accelerated decay of the corresponding mRNA, while the splice site mutation results in maturation of a cryptic wild-type γ2 mRNA leading to reduced expression of wild-type laminin 5. In vitro studies using the probands' keratinocytes showed that secretion of reduced amounts of functional laminin 5 in the patient, although permitting formation of hemidesmosomes, fail to restore efficient cell adhesion. Our results provide the first evidence that laminin 5 contributes to the firm adhesion of the epithelial basement membrane to the underlying stroma. They also show that a low expression level of laminin 5 induces assembly of mature hemidesmosomes in vivobut fails to assure a stable cohesion of the dermal-epidermal junction.

The nonsense mutation causes accelerated decay of the corresponding mRNA, while the splice site mutation results in maturation of a cryptic wild-type γ2 mRNA leading to reduced expression of wild-type laminin 5. In vitro studies using the probands' keratinocytes showed that secretion of reduced amounts of functional laminin 5 in the patient, although permitting formation of hemidesmosomes, fail to restore efficient cell adhesion. Our results provide the first evidence that laminin 5 contributes to the firm adhesion of the epithelial basement membrane to the underlying stroma. They also show that a low expression level of laminin 5 induces assembly of mature hemidesmosomes in vivobut fails to assure a stable cohesion of the dermal-epidermal junction. epidermolysis bullosa basement membrane junctional EB monoclonal antibody polyclonal antibody extracellular matrix phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription-PCR nucleotide(s) bovine serum albumin Epidermolysis bullosa (EB)1 is a heterogeneous group of inherited diseases characterized by epithelial fragility to mechanical friction resulting in blisters and erosions of the integument. Extracutaneous involvement includes erosions of squamous and transitional epithelia, pitted enamel, alopecia, and nail dystrophia. The different forms of EB are associated with molecular defects in components of the dermal-epidermal junction (1Fine J.D. Eady R.A. Bauer E.A. Briggaman R.A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Christiano A. Heagerty A. Hintner H. Jonkman M.F. McGrath J. McGuire J. Moshell A. Shimizu H. Tadini G. Uitto J. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2000; 42: 1051-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The dermal-epidermal junction is a complex basement membrane (BM) ultrastructurally composed of four compartments: the ventral plasma membrane of the basal keratinocytes and the associated hemidesmosomes; the lamina lucida, which includes the anchoring filaments; the lamina densa; and the upper papillary dermis containing the anchoring fibrils (2Mellerio J.E. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 1999; 24: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). About 20 biochemical components have so far been identified that localize in the different compartments of the dermal-epidermal junction. Among them type IV collagen, the backbone of all the basement membranes, is the major component of the lamina densa; type VII collagen is the prominent component of the anchoring fibrils; and laminins 5, 6, and 10 localize both in the lamina lucida and the lamina densa (3Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Sonnenberg A. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The hemidesmosome-anchoring filament complex and the anchoring fibrils form a specialized attachment structure common to the stratified and simple epithelia exposed to the external environment (3Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Sonnenberg A. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Based on ultrastructural data and antigen mapping, EB has been divided into three major clinical subtypes according to the level of the blister plane (4Zambruno G. Ortonne J. Meneguzzi G.,. Kanitakis J. Vassileva S. Woodley D. Diagnostic Immunohistochemistry of the Skin. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 126-142Google Scholar). In EB simplex, tissue separation occurs within the basal keratinocytes as a result of genetic mutations in keratins 5 and 14 or in the hemidesmosomal component plectin. In junctional EB (JEB), blisters arise within the lamina lucida, with the basal epidermal cells at the roof of the blister and the lamina densa at its base. Tissue cleavage results from mutations in the extracellular adhesion ligand laminin 5 and the two transmembrane components of hemidesmosomes, integrin α6β4 and collagen type XVII. In dystrophic EB, the split localizes within the papillary dermis below the lamina densa and results from mutations in collagen type VII. Immunostaining of EB skin using an adequate panel of antibodies may detect the abnormal expression of a specific BM component and identify the candidate gene(s) in the disease (4Zambruno G. Ortonne J. Meneguzzi G.,. Kanitakis J. Vassileva S. Woodley D. Diagnostic Immunohistochemistry of the Skin. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 126-142Google Scholar). Laminin 5 (the laminin α3β3γ2 heterotrimer) is specifically associated with the hemidesmosome-anchoring filament complexes (5Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In the skin, laminin 5 is synthesized and secreted into the extracellular matrix by the basal keratinocytes and constitutes a specific substrate for static attachment and for adhesion of proliferating and migrating cells. Null mutations in any of the three genes (LAMA3,LAMB3, and LAMC2) encoding laminin 5 cause the extensive epithelial disadhesion distinctive of lethal JEB (H-JEB, for Herlitz JEB) (17Aberdam D. Galliano M.F. Vailly J. Pulkkinen L. Bonifas J. Christiano A.M. Tryggvason K. Uitto J. Epstein E.H. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Mutations leading to synthesis of an aberrant but partially functional laminin 5 result in mild JEB (nH-JEB, for non-Herlitz JEB), which is characterized by a limited tendency to skin blistering. In H-JEB, hemidesmosomes are absent or hypoplastic and/or reduced in number. In nH-JEB, hemidesmosomes may be reduced in number, lack the hemidesmosomal subbasal dense plate, and have rudimentary cytoplasmic plaques. Transfer of a curative transgene that rescues expression of functional laminin 5 in H-JEB keratinocytes restores hemidesmosome assembly and cell adhesion (18Meneguzzi G. Vailly J. Hengge U.R. Volc-Platzer B. The Skin and Gene Therapy. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 97-116Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that laminin 5 mediates epithelial cell adhesion by interacting with integrins α6β4and α3β1 through its COOH-terminal G-domain (19Carter W. Ryan M. Gahr P. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 20Niessen C.M. Hogervorst F. Jaspars L.H. De Melker A.A. Delw G.O. Hulsman E.H.M. Kuikman I. Sonnenberg A. Exp.

Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1083-1102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In blistered nH-JEB skin, immunoreactive laminin 5 distributes along the floor of the blister, which indicates interaction of the protein with components of the lamina densa and the papillary dermis. Furthermore, laminin 5 binds the NC-1 domain of collagen type VII (22Chen M. Marinkovich M.P. Veis A. Cai X. Rao C.N. O'Toole E.A. Woodley D.T. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and associates with laminin 6 in the skin and laminin 7 in the amnion (24Champliaud M.F. Lunstrum G.P. Rousselle P.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Additional evidence supporting a structural function of laminin 5 in basement membrane stability includes immunochemical data, which suggests that initiation of skin basement membrane formation involves assembly of laminin 5 into laminin complexes and interaction with integrins β1 and β4 (26Fleischmajer R. Utani A. MacDonald E.D. Perlish J.S. Pan T.C. Chu M.L. Nomizu M. Ninomiya Y. Yamada Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1929-1940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the active role of laminin 5 in structuring of the basement membrane has not been substantiated by direct in vivo observations and remains hypothetical. In this study, we have disclosed the molecular basis of an unusual form of lethal epidermolysis bullosa associated with novel genetic mutations in the LAMC2 gene. This form is characterized by a reduced production of wild type laminin 5, the presence of mature hemidesmosomes, and tissue separation underneath the lamina densa of the dermal-epidermal junction. Our results provide the first evidence that laminin 5 contributes to the firm adhesion of the epithelial basement membrane to the underlying stroma. The two EB probands were generated by healthy parents in a family with a history free of skin diseases and genetic disorders. Proband 1 developed extensive cutaneous blisters and erosions of the upper digestive tract shortly after birth. EB was diagnosed on the basis of ultrastructural analysis of involved skin that revealed severing of the dermal-epidermal junction. The infant died at the age of 6 months. Proband 2 was the result of a second pregnancy. At the 21st week of gestation, prenatal diagnosis performed on fetal skin biopsies by electron microscope examination detected epithelial detachment. The pregnancy was terminated. Pathologic examination of the fetus was performed immediately after delivery and confirmed the fragility of the skin and mucosa. Primary keratinocytes isolated from skin biopsies were cultured on lethally irradiated feeders of mouse 3T3-J2 fibroblasts in the presence of a mixture (3:1) of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Cergy-Pontoise, France). The medium contained 10% fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.1 nm cholera toxin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 2 nm triiodothyronine, and 0.18 mm adenine (27Rheinwald J. G in Cell Growth and Division: A Practical Approach. Oxford, 1989: 81-94Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified from cultured keratinocytes using the RNable™ extraction kit (Eurobio, Les Ullis, France). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood following standard techniques. Ultrastructural examination of noninvolved skin and mechanically induced blisters was performed as described (28Gache Y. Chavanas S. Lacour J.P. Wiche G. Owaribe K. Meneguzzi G. Ortonne J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were examined with a JEOL EM 1200 transmission electron microscope. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on 5-μm sections of frozen skin samples and on cultures of primary keratinocytes (28Gache Y. Chavanas S. Lacour J.P. Wiche G. Owaribe K. Meneguzzi G. Ortonne J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The samples were examined using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. Antigen mapping was performed using monoclonal antibody (mAb) GB3 raised against native laminin 5 (29Verrando P. Blanchet-Bardon C. Pisani A. Thomas L. Cambazard F. Eady R.A.J. Schofield O.

A pAb anti-laminin 1 (L9393; Sigma), a pAb anti-collagen type IV (10411; Institut Pasteur, Paris, France), and the pAb LH7:2 directed against collagen type VII (34Leigh I.M. Eady R.A. Heagerty A.H. Purkis P.E. Whitehead P.A. Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 90: 639-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were also employed. For Western blot analysis of the extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by the proband's keratinocytes, subconfluent cell cultures were detached by treatment with 10 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The ECM was then scraped from the culture support in the presence of 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8. The samples were briefly sonicated and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). 25 μl of the ECM and serial dilutions of the original solution in PBS were electrophoresed in a 6% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted on nylon filters (35Gagnoux-Palacios L.

The antibody-antigen complex was revealed using the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitation of autoradiograms was performed by densitometric scanning using the Bioprofil software program (Vilber Lourmat, France). 30 μg of total RNA purified from cultured keratinocytes was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with32P-random-labeled laminin β3, γ2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes as described (36Chavanas S.

To search for mutations in LAMC2 individual exons were PCR-amplified using 100 ng of genomic DNA as a template and oligonucleotide primer pairs synthesized on the basis of the flanking intronic sequences (37Pulkkinen L. McGrath J. Airenne T. Haakana H. Tryggvason K. Kivirikko S. Meneguzzi G. Ortonne J.P. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 124-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Specifically, for amplification of the 230-bp DNA fragment comprising the 189-bp exon 7 (nucleotides 764–953 in the cDNA; GenBankTM number U31184) and containing the maternal mutation 764−10T→G, the following primers were used: 5′-TCATAGCCCAAAGTGCATA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGCTTGTTGAACAAATGAA-3′ (reverse) (37Pulkkinen L. McGrath J. Airenne T. Haakana H. Tryggvason K. Kivirikko S. Meneguzzi G. Ortonne J.P. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 124-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For amplification of the 152-bp exon 18 (nucleotides 2601–2753 in the cDNA; GenBankTM number U31195) containing the paternal mutation Q896X, the primers were 5′-GGTGTGGTAACTGGTAAGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TATTCATATGGTGGGCATTC-3′ (reverse). The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. 5 μl of the PCR products were used for heteroduplex analysis by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (38Ganguly A. Rock M.J. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10325-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) followed by direct automated sequencing of the PCR products containing a heteroduplex band (ABI, Foster City, California). The presence of mutations Q896X and 764−10T→G in members of the family and unrelated healthy controls was assessed by direct sequence analysis. Occurrence of mutation 764−10T→G was further investigated in 100 alleles of unrelated healthy controls by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization as described (36Chavanas S. Gache Y. Vailly J. Kanitakis J. Pulkkinen L. Uitto J. Ortonne J.-P. Meneguzzi G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2097-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The allele-specific oligonucleotides were 5′-GCTGTGAAACAGAGTTTTA-3′ and 5′-GCTGTGAAACCGAGTTTTA-3′, corresponding to the wild type and mutant LAMC2 sequences, respectively. Total RNA isolated from the control and the patient's cultured keratinocytes was reverse transcribed in a volume of 25 μl using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). One μl of each reaction product was used to amplify overlapping regions of the cDNAs spanning the open reading frame of the laminin γ2 chain. Specifically, for amplification of the 439-bp cDNA fragment (nucleotides 588–1027; GenBankTM number X73902) (31Vailly J. Verrando P. Champliaud M.F. Gerecke D. Wagman D.W. Baudoin C. Aberdam D. Burgeson R. Bauer E. Ortonne J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) including the 23-bp deletion generated by the maternal mutation 764−10T→G, the oligonucleotide primers were 5′-GCAGCTTCTGCAGAATACAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGATTCCGCAGTAACCTTCG-3′ (reverse). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The amplification products were submitted to direct automated sequencing. To isolate the wild-type RNA transcripts of the maternalLAMC2 allele, 1 μl of the reverse transcription product was submitted to allele-specific long range PCR amplification using the Expand PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to generate a 1.9-kilobase cDNA fragment (nucleotides 763–2705). The sense primer (5′-CAAATTCTTGGGAATCAACAG-3′) was homologous to the sequence deleted in the maternal γ2 cDNA bearing the mutation 764−10T→G. The antisense primer (5′-CCAGTTTCCCAGATTCTTCTG-3′, nt 2685–2705) was homologous to the maternal γ2 cDNA fragment harboring guanine 2688 (which in the paternal γ2 cDNA is substituted by a polymorphic adenosine). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 20 s, 52 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 1 min 30 s (10 cycles), 94 °C for 20 s, 52 °C for 45 s, and 68 °C for 2 min (25 cycles with an increment of 20 s in extension time at each stage). Direct sequence analysis of the amplimer was performed using the primer 5′-GATTCAGTGTCTCCGCTTCA-3′ (nucleotides 2557–2576). Laminin 5 deposition on plastic cell culture substrate was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cells (2 × 103, 5 × 103, and 1 × 104/well) were seeded in multiwell plates (96 wells; TPP, Zurich, Switzerland) and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere in the presence of 5% CO2. The wells were then washed twice in PBS and detached as previously described by Delwel et al. (39Delwel G.O. Hogervorst F. Kuikman I. Paulsson M. Timpl R. Sonnenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 26: 25865-25875Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 20 mm Hepes, 20 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and a general protease inhibitor mixture (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) and then dislodged by pipetting. The matrices were washed with PBS, incubated for 10 min with PBS plus 1% Triton X-100 to remove cell debris, and saturated for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS plus 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Each well was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 50 μl of PBS plus 2% BSA containing mAb GB3 (10 μg/ml). The plates were washed three times with PBS and incubated 1 h at room temperature with 50 μl of PBS plus 2% BSA containing 1 μg/ml of anti-mouse HRP mAb (Dako) per well. After three washes with PBS, 50 μl of a solution of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) were added to each well for 15 min in the dark as devised by the supplier. The reaction was stopped by adding a 2m solution of H2SO4, and color yields were determined at 490 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Dynatech, Guyancourt, France). Keratinocytes (3 × 104 cells/well) were plated in the presence of serum-free medium in 96-well tissue culture plates (Polylabo, Strasbourg, France). The wells had previously been coated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V (Sigma) or 10 μg/ml Engelbreth Holm-Swarm Mouse Sarcoma matrigel (Sigma) by overnight adsorption at 4 °C, washed twice with PBS, and saturated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.5% heat-inactivated BSA in PBS. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1, 16, or 24 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the attached cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol for 15 min. Excess dye was washed off with water, and the stained cells were eluted with 100 μl of a solution containing 50% ethanol and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.2. Absorbance at 560 nm was read in a microplate manager (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific adhesion was evaluated by seeding the keratinocytes in wells coated with 0.5% BSA. Each assay point was derived in triplicate. For cell detachment assays, suspensions of secondary keratinocytes (6 × 104cells/cm2) were seeded in tissue culture flasks and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. The cell cultures were then rinsed and treated with a solution of 0.05% trypsin, 0.01% EDTA (0.5m), pH 8. The number of cells detached at different times was determined by collecting the supernatants of each cell culture and direct cell counting. All measurements were performed in triplicate, and the results obtained from the three different experiments were expressed as the mean of S.D. The probands presented with the characteristic clinical phenotype of severe EB. Ultrastructural examination of nonlesional skin detected mature hemidesmosomes and well formed anchoring filaments connected to the lamina densa of the basement membrane zone (Fig.1 A). In fresh lesions of blistered skin, the cleavage plane localized below the lamina densa, and hemidesmosomes were well formed (Fig. 1 B). Careful examination of the involved skin also detected lesions with the cleft lying within the lamina lucida and presenting normally shaped hemidesmosomes at the roof of the blister (Fig. 1 C). Immunoreactivity of noninvolved skin to mAb GB3 against laminin 5 was strongly reduced compared with the control skin of nonaffected donors (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, immunoreactivity of integrin α6 (Fig. 2,G and H) and that of all of the major basement membrane components (not shown) was comparable with that detected in control skin. This finding suggested the possibility of a potential association of the disease with an altered expression of laminin 5. Indeed, labeling with the anti-laminin γ2 pAb SE144 was faint (Fig.2, C and D), while staining with mAb K140 (Fig.2, E and F) and pAb SE85 (data not shown) specific to the laminin β3 and α3 chains, respectively, was slightly decreased. These observations suggested that LAMC2was the candidate gene in the condition. In the lesional skin, immunostaining of laminin 5, type IV collagen, laminin 1, and type VII collagen was located at the roof of the blisters (Fig.3, A–D), which confirmed the sublamina densa severing of the basement membrane. In a few blisters, the cleavage plane partially localized within the lamina lucida, above the lamina densa (Fig. 3, insets).Figure 2Immunohistochemical analysis of the noninvolved skin from proband 1. In cryostat skin sections, staining of the basement membrane using mAb GB3 specific to native laminin 5 was attenuated and discontinuous (A) compared with healthy controls (B). Immunoreactivity of each individual chain of laminin 5 is also reduced with a strong attenuation of the fluorescent signal with the anti-γ2 pAb SE144 (C) and a less marked reduction with the anti-β3 mAb K140 (E) and anti-α3 pAb SE85 (not shown). In contrast, immunoreactivity to mAb GoH3 specific to the integrin α6 subunit is comparable in the patient (G) and in the control (H).Scale bar, 48 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Immunohistochemical analysis of the lesional skin in proband 2.

To confirm the direct implication of laminin 5 in the condition, the expression level of the laminin β3 and γ2 chains was determined by Northern blot analysis of total RNA purified from keratinocytes isolated from the EB fetus. Compared with control keratinocytes, expression of the laminin γ2 chain was 80% reduced in the patient's cells, whereas the steady state level of the laminin β3 transcripts was not affected (Fig.4).

Mutations at P2 subsite residues (Y93F and K56R) caused a much greater decrease in phosphate binding affinity of yeast PPase in the presence of Mn2+ or Co2+than mutations at P1 subsite residues (R78K and K193R). Phosphate binding was estimated in these experiments from the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis at a sub-Km concentration of ATP. Tight phosphate binding required four Mn2+ ions/active site. These data identify P2 as the high affinity subsite and P1 as the low affinity subsite, the difference in the affinities being at least 250-fold. The time course of five “isotopomers” of phosphate that have from zero to four 18O during [18O]Pi-[16O]H2O oxygen exchange indicated that the phosphate containing added water is released after the leaving group phosphate during pyrophosphate hydrolysis. These findings provide support for the structure-based mechanism in which pyrophosphate hydrolysis involves water attack on the phosphorus atom located at the P2 subsite of PPase.

Inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1; PPase)1is a ubiquitous enzyme catalyzing interconversion of PPi and Pi. Soluble PPase provides a thermodynamic pull for biosynthetic reactions by removing PPi formed when nucleoside 5′-triphosphates are converted to the corresponding monophosphates (1Kornberg A. Kasha M. Pullman B. Horizons in Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1962: 251Google Scholar). The PPase reaction involves, in the direction of hydrolysis, PPi binding, isomerization of the resulting complex, PPi hydrolysis, and the stepwise release of two Pi molecules (Schemefigfsi) (2Baykov A.A. Fabrichniy I.P. Pohjanjoki P. Zyryanov A.B. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11939-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis step proceeds via direct attack of water on PPi without formation of a covalent intermediate (3Gonzalez M.A. Webb M.R. Welsh K.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Numerous mechanistic studies of PPase have been carried out (for reviews, see Refs. 4Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R.

In addition, an activated water molecule, placed between two metal ions in the vicinity of P2, was considered the only logical candidate for nucleophile (6Heikinheimo P. Lehtonen J. Baykov A. Lahti R. Cooperman B. Goldman A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1491-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This supposition was confirmed by the structure of the F–-inhibited complex (8Heikinheimo P. Tuominen V. Ahonen A.-K. Teplyakov A. Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3121-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which showed a fluoride ion replacing that water molecule. Solution confirmation of this interpretation has been harder to achieve, however. The oxygen exchange measurements done in the presence of Mg2+ as the activator have shown unequivocally that the Pi containing the electrophilic phosphorus is released first after PPihydrolysis (9Springs B. Welsh K.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6384-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In terms of the structure-based mechanism (6Heikinheimo P. Lehtonen J. Baykov A. Lahti R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7754-7760Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), this would mean that Pi is first released from P2, where it is more buried than at P1. Resolving this issue requires knowledge of the relative affinities of P1 and P2 for Pi because it is logical to expect faster release from a weaker binding subsite. Earlier attempts to compare the affinities of P1 and P2 used three types of data (5Baykov A.A. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Lahti R. Progr. Mol. Subcell. Biochem. 1999; 23: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), each of which has been subject to criticism. First, preferential binding of sulfate, an analog of Pi, occurred at P1 in the PPase crystals grown in the presence of sulfate (11Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Wilson K.S. Ishii K. Kaji H. Samejima T. Kuranova I. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1098-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Avaeva S. Kurilova S. Nazarova T. Rodina E. Vorobyeva N. Sklyankina V. Grigorjeva O. Harutyunyan E. Oganessyan V. Wilson K. Dauter Z. Huber R. Mather T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the crystallization medium in these studies contained no metal ions, the major Pi ligands at the P2 subsite (Fig. 1). Second, x-ray data indicate more extensive hydrogen bonding between the enzyme and Pi at P1 than at P2 (Fig. 1), which was thought to provide greater binding strength at P1. We will show below that this is not the case for Mn2+ and Co2+ as cofactors. Third, protection of Arg78, located at P1, against chemical modification upon binding of 1 mol of Pi/mol of subunit in the presence of Mn2+ was interpreted as showing that P1 binds first (13Cooperman B.S. Panackal A. Springs B. Hamm D.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6051-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, because of the close proximity of P1 and P2, the protection could equally result from binding to P2. We will show below that P2 does in fact exhibit a far greater affinity for Pi in the presence of Mn2+ and Co2+.We addressed the correct assignment of the phosphate binding subsites by employing site-directed mutagenesis of Pi ligands together with Pi binding and Pi-water oxygen exchange measurements in the presence of Mn2+ and Co2+. By comparison with Mg2+, these cations induce a much greater difference in the binding affinities of P1 and P2, as evidenced by the fact that only one Pi binding site/subunit was observed over a wide range of Piconcentrations (13Cooperman B.S. Panackal A. Springs B. Hamm D.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6051-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Baykov A.A. Shestakov A.S. Pavlov A.R. Smirnova I.N. Larionov V.N. Avaeva S.M. Biokhimiya. 1989; 54: 796-803Google Scholar). In the presence of Mg2+, the affinities of P1 and P2 for MgPi differ only 1–9-fold (9Springs B. Welsh K.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6384-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,15Kasho V.N. Baykov A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Webb E.C. Enzymes. Longman Group Ltd., London1979: 144-145Google Scholar). The results reported below demonstrate that the relative affinities of P1 and P2 and the order in which these sites release Pi during PPi hydrolysis depend on the nature of the metal ion cofactor used and provide support for the mechanism currently proposed for this reaction.EM2⇌k2k1EM4PP*⇌kBkAEM4PP⇌k4k3EM4P2⇌k6k5EM3P⇌k8k7EM2SCHEME I.

(18Heikinheimo P. Pohjanjoki P. Helminen A. Tasanen M. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentration was calculated on the basis of a subunit molecular mass of 32 kDa (19Cohen S. Sterner R. Keim P. Heinrikson R. J. Biol.

Acta. 1956; 20: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of ATP were standardized by measuring light absorbance at 260 nm (ε = 15, 400 m−1cm−1) (22Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Clarendon Press, Oxford1986Google Scholar). 18O-enriched potassium phosphate (96.4%) was prepared according to Hackney et al.(23Hackney D.D. Stempel K.E. Boyer P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 60-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).ATP hydrolysis was assayed luminometrically. The assay mixture of a 0.2–1-ml volume contained 1 μm ATP, 83 mmTES/KOH (pH 7.2), 17 mm KCl, and varied amounts of potassium phosphate and MnCl2. Assays done with Co2+ employed a 100 mm MOPS/KOH buffer (without KCl) because TES was reported to bind Co2+ appreciably (24Vanni A. Gastaldi D. Ann. Chim. 1986; 76: 375-385Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin (0.01 mg/ml) was also added for enzyme stability in the assays done with R78K-PPase. The reaction was initiated by adding PPase. Aliquots (20 μl) of the assay mixture were withdrawn at 2–3-min intervals over 20–25 min and added to 0.18 ml of 0.1 m Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.75) containing luciferin/luciferase reagent (Sigma ATP assay mix), 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The luminescence was then measured with an LKB model 1250 luminometer. The concentration of the luciferin/luciferase reagent was sufficient to produce a 100-mV signal for samples containing 1 μm ATP.The procedures used to measure enzyme-bound PPi formation at equilibrium (25Fabrichniy I.P.

The media used in the incubations for oxygen exchange and synthesis of enzyme-bound PPi were prepared by mixing appropriate volumes of 100 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm MOPS/KOH buffer (pH 7.2), and 100 or 3 mm CoCl2, respectively. Although the solubility products for CoHPO4(1.9·10−7m2 (Ref.27Goloshchapov M.V. Martynenko B.V. Filatova T.N. Inorg. Chem. ( Russian ). 1966; 11: 935-937Google Scholar)) and MnHPO4 (1.4·10−13m2 (Ref.

Technol. 1961; 5: 707-709Google Scholar)) were exceeded in many of the incubations, no incipient precipitation occurred in the concentration ranges of the metal ions and Pi used in this study. That the precipitation in these systems is quite slow was confirmed by the following data. First, no decrease in Pi concentration was detected when solutions containing 1 mm Mn2+plus 200 μm Pi or 20 mmMn2+ plus 20 μm Pi were incubated for 30 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 4,000 × g. Similarly, no change in Co2+ concentration, measured with Arsenazo III (28Chukhlantsev V.G. Alyamovskaya K.V. Izv. Vyssh. Uchebn. Zaved. SSSR Khim. Khim. Technol. 1961; 5: 707-709Google Scholar), was detected at 0.5 mm Co2+and 5 mm Pi after a 15-min incubation and centrifugation as above. At higher concentrations of the metal ions and Pi, the solutions became opalescent, and a decrease in Pi or Co2+ concentration was observed after centrifugation.All measurements were performed at 25 °C.The concentrations of free Mn2+ and Co2+ions and of their complexes with Pi were calculated using dissociation constants of 3.6 and 9.8 mm, respectively, which were measured with Arsenazo III (29Rowatt E. Williams R.J.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) under the conditions used in the present work. 2A. B. Zyryanov, manuscript in preparation.ATP hydrolysis in the presence of Pi is described by SchemeFSII, where kcat is the catalytic constant and Kp is the dissociation constant of the enzyme·Pi complex. Y-PPase converts ATP into ADP and Pi, and further hydrolysis of ADP to yield AMP and Pi proceeds at a negligible rate (30Schlesinger M.J. Coon M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 41: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The rate of ATP hydrolysis obeyed Equation 1, where t is time, Km is the Michaelis constant, and [E] is free enzyme concentration. In the absence of Pi (added externally or formed from ATP), [E] could be equated to the total enzyme concentration, [E]t, because the Michaelis constant for ATP is in excess of 100 μm, a value much greater than its concentration in the reaction medium. In the presence of Pi, [E] could be calculated from Equation 2, where [P]t is the total Pi concentration in the reaction medium. Equation 2 was obtained by solving the equation for Kp (Equation 3) together with Equations 4and 5, describing mass balance for enzyme and inhibitor, respectively.−d[ATP]dt=kcatKm[ATP][E]Equation 1 E=0.5Et−Pt−Kp+Et−Pt−Kp2+4KpEtEquation 2 [P][E]/[E·P]=KpEquation 3 [E]+[E·P]=[E]tEquation 4 [P]+[E·P]=[P]tEquation 5 It should be noted that [P]t in Equations 2 and 5refers to the sum of the added and enzymatically generated Pi and is therefore given by Equation 6, where [P]0 and [ATP]0 are the initial concentrations of Pi and ATP, respectively.[P]t=[P]0+[ATP]0−[ATP]Equation 6 In theory, the value for Kp could be obtained from the time course of ATP hydrolysis measured in the absence of added Pi ([P]0 = 0), thus evaluating the effect of Pi produced enzymatically. However, much more accurate estimates for this parameter were obtained from fittings that simultaneously employed the time courses measured in the absence and presence of added Pi (Fig.2). When such time courses were measured at varied [E]t, it was treated as a variable along with t and [P]0.Figure 2Time courses of Mn2+-supported ATP hydrolysis by wild type Y-PPase in the absence and presence of 1 μm phosphate.

The remaining interactions are through four metal ions. We have demonstrated previously that the Y-PPase variants used in the present work retain 2–20% activity against PPi (18Heikinheimo P. Pohjanjoki P. Helminen A. Tasanen M. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that the active site remains catalytically competent. It is noteworthy that the mutations used are highly conservative and do not change the overall charge of the active site. The absence of large changes in structure outside active site in the R78K variant has been demonstrated by x-ray crystallography (38Tuominen V. Heikinheimo P. Kajander T. Torkkel T. Hyytiä T. Käpylä J. Lahti R. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1565-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this variant, the positive charge on the introduced lysine is displaced by about 3 Å compared with arginine.The Pi binding capacity of four of these variants was estimated here from the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of Mn2+ and Co2+ as cofactors. The advantage of these cations over Mg2+ is 3-fold. First and most important, the binding affinities of the subsites P1 and P2 differ much more in the presence of Mn2+ or Co2+ (13Cooperman B.S. Panackal A. Springs B. Hamm D.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6051-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Baykov A.A. Shestakov A.S. Pavlov A.R. Smirnova I.N. Larionov V.N. Avaeva S.M. Biokhimiya. 1989; 54: 796-803Google Scholar). Second, these cations support hydrolysis of ATP (Mg2+ does not), a substrate with a high Km value. At 1 μm ATP, more than 99% of Y-PPase is substrate-free in the assay medium. Therefore, the true Pi binding constant can be estimated directly from the effect of Pi on activity at this fixed ATP concentration. Third, the structure shown in Fig. 1was, in fact, determined for M = Mn2+, although similar radii and coordination chemistry for Mn2+ and Mg2+ suggest that this structure should be largely preserved with Mg2+.P2 Is the Tighter Binding Subsite for Phosphate in the Presence of Mn2+ and Co2+The data in Fig. 3 and Tables I and II indicate that the two mutations at subsite P2 have a much greater effect on Pi binding to Y-PPase than the two mutations at subsite P1. The measured binding clearly refers to the tighter binding subsite because occupancy of any one of the two subsites by Pi will suffice for inhibition. Furthermore, the data in Fig. 5 demonstrate that the dissociation constant for the weaker binding subsite is as high as 3 mm in the presence of Co2+, 240 times larger than for the tighter binding site (Table II). The weaker binding site was thus essentially empty duringKp measurements, consistent with the earlier equilibrium dialysis and Pi titration data revealing only one Pi binding subsite in the presence of Mn2+and Co2+ and up to 0.1 mm Pi (13Cooperman B.S. Panackal A. Springs B. Hamm D.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6051-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,14Baykov A.A. Shestakov A.S. Pavlov A.R. Smirnova I.N. Larionov V.N. Avaeva S.M. Biokhimiya. 1989; 54: 796-803Google Scholar).Other data support the identification of P2 as the tighter binding subsite in the presence of Mn2+ and Co2+. First, the tighter binding site requires four Mn2+ ions for optimal Pi binding (Scheme FSIII), as one would expect for P2 that has four metal ligands, rather than P1 that has only two (Fig. 1). Second, Pi was observed only in P2 in the manganese structure of the R78K variant (38Tuominen V. Heikinheimo P. Kajander T. Torkkel T. Hyytiä T. Käpylä J. Lahti R. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1565-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whose Pi binding affinity is similar to that of the wild type enzyme. Finally, mutations at the P2 subsite (K29R and Y55F) in E. coli PPase have also been shown to have greater effects on Pi binding measured in the presence of 0.1 mm Mn2+ than mutations at the P1 subsite (R43K, Y141F, and K142R). 4Hyytiä, T., Halonen, P., Salminen, A., Goldman, A., Lahti, R., and Cooperman, B. S. (2001)Biochemistry, in press.Interestingly, the effects of the mutations on ATP binding, as characterized by kcat/Km(Tables I and II), parallel those on Pi binding (Fig. 3 and Table II). This indicates that ATP binding is dominated by interactions at subsite P2. One of the P1 mutations (R78K) increaseskcat/Km for Mn2+-supported ATP hydrolysis nearly 5-fold (Table I), suggesting that the interaction of Arg78 with the β-phosphate of ATP is destabilizing in the enzyme-substrate complex.P2 Contains the Electrophilic Phosphorus AtomOne would expect faster release of the product Pi from P1, where binding is much weaker, insofar as this Pi faces solution, whereas the P2 Pi is buried at the bottom of the active site (6Heikinheimo P. Lehtonen J. Baykov A. Lahti R. Cooperman B. Goldman A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1491-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 7Harutyunyan E.H. Kuranova I.P.

On the other hand, the Pi containing the electrophilic center is released first in the presence of Mg2+ (9Springs B. Welsh K.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6384-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, either the electrophilic center is at P1, or the order of Pi release is reversed with Mn2+ and Co2+. A choice between these alternatives can be made on the basis of the oxygen exchange data.The rationale for using this approach is as follows. Once bound to the electrophilic center, each Pi molecule undergoes a series of synthesis/hydrolysis cycles, each resulting in exchange of one of the four oxygens. The longer the Pi molecule stays in the active site, the more extensive is the exchange before it is released into solution. The average number of exchange cycles depends on the probability of Pi forming PPi versusbeing released into solution, Pc. If the electrophilic Pi molecule is released first,Pc is equal tok4/(k4 +k5) (9Springs B. Welsh K.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6384-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5320-5328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is thus independent of [P]t, as observed in the case of the Mg2+-supported reaction (9Springs B. Welsh K.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6384-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Kasho V.N. Baykov A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

If, however, the electrophilic Pi molecule is released second, the time it stays in the active site would increase with increasing the occupancy of the other subsite and hence would depend on [P]taccording to Equation 11 (9). At infinite [P]t, Pi never leaves the enzyme, resulting in exchange of all of its oxygens (Pc = 1). At [P]tapproaching 0, Pc would also approach 0, corresponding to zero exchange. A thorough theoretical analysis of the Pi-water oxygen exchange catalyzed by PPase was done by Hackney (31Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5320-5328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Pc=11+k7k4+k5/k4k6[P]tEquation 11 Fig. 6 A shows that Pc increases from about 0 to 0.88 with [P]t in the Co2+-supported reaction. Importantly, this effect is observed at the Pi concentrations allowing appreciable binding to both P2 and P1 (Fig. 5). This provides strong evidence that the Pi molecule acquiring oxygen from water during PPi hydrolysis is released second. This conclusion is consistent withvex/[E]t going through a maximum at increasing [P]t (Fig. 6 B). Indeed, the exchange rate depends on [EP] in this case, and [EP] passes through a maximum when Piconcentration is increased. Accordingly, the rate of the release of phosphate-containing exchanged oxygens (equal tovex(4 − 3Pc)/4Pc[E]t, where 4Pc/(4 − 3Pc) is the average number of the exchanged oxygens in each Pimolecule (23Hackney D.D. Stempel K.E. Boyer P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 60-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) decreases with [P]t (Fig. 6 B). In the Mg2+-supported reaction, Pcis independent of [P]t, which is strong evidence that the Pi molecule containing the oxygen that comes from water is released first, and the exchange rate, which is proportional to [EPP] in this case, always increases with [P]t (9Springs B. Welsh K.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6384-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Kasho V.N. Baykov A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Because slower release of Pi is expected from the tighter binding site, the electrophilic center is thus at P2.As mentioned above, the independence of Pc from [Pi] in the presence of Mg2+ provides strong evidence that the Pi containing the electrophilic phosphorus is released first after PPi hydrolysis (9Springs B. Welsh K.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6384-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This implies that the order in which the two subsites release Piis reversed in the presence of Mg2+, which may mean that the Pi binding affinities of P1 and P2 are also reversed.It should be noted that the upper limit for Pcin Fig. 6 A is less than the value of unity predicted by Equation 7. A likely explanation is that the release of the two Pi molecules formed is not a strictly ordered reaction in the presence of Co2+; that is to say, a significant fraction of Pi leaves P1 first. This explanation is consistent with the observation that the value ofvex(4 − 3Pc)/4Pc[E]ttends to reach a constant non-zero value with increasing Piconcentration (Fig. 6 B) rather than approach 0, as expected for a strictly ordered release.To sum up, these data provide strong support for the mechanism of PPi hydrolysis (6Heikinheimo P.

Inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1; PPase)1is a ubiquitous enzyme catalyzing interconversion of PPi and Pi. Soluble PPase provides a thermodynamic pull for biosynthetic reactions by removing PPi formed when nucleoside 5′-triphosphates are converted to the corresponding monophosphates (1Kornberg A. Kasha M. Pullman B. Horizons in Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1962: 251Google Scholar). The PPase reaction involves, in the direction of hydrolysis, PPi binding, isomerization of the resulting complex, PPi hydrolysis, and the stepwise release of two Pi molecules (Schemefigfsi) (2Baykov A.A. Fabrichniy I.P. Pohjanjoki P. Zyryanov A.B. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11939-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis step proceeds via direct attack of water on PPi without formation of a covalent intermediate (3Gonzalez M.A. Webb M.R. Welsh K.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Numerous mechanistic studies of PPase have been carried out (for reviews, see Refs. 4Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R.

Binding of TFIID is followed by the subsequent ordered interactions of the other general transcription factors (TFIIA, -IIB, -IIE, -IIF, -IIH) and Pol II to yield a productive PIC (2Roeder R.G. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). TFIID is a protein complex composed of TBP and a number of TBP associated factors (TAFIIs) (3Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The discovery that TBP is not only a component of the TFIID complex but is also present in transcription complexes functioning in Pol I and III transcription, placed TBP as a central player in transcription (4Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar).In vitro recombinant TBP can substitute for TFIID in reconstituted basal transcription systems but does not support transcription from TATA-less promoters (5Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Moreover, in Drosophila and human cell-free systems TFIID but not TBP could support activator-dependent transcription. These findings suggested that TAFIIs are essential both for transcription initiation and for the response to transcriptional activators in vitro(3Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Evidence showing that TAFIIs may function as coactivators in vivo has come from either mammalian cell transfection experiments (6May M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.-C. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or from genetic studies inDrosophila (7Zhou J. Zwicker J. Szymanski P. Levine M. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13483-13488Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the above cell-free systems, activation of in vitro transcription in a TBP-dependent manner was reported in a TAFII-depleted nuclear extract (8Oelgeschlager T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Two active forms of TBP have been recently reported in yeast, a TAF-dependent and a TAF-independent form, that can mediate Pol II transcription in vivo (9Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K. Science. 2000; 288: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Novel complexes consisting of TAFIIs and a plethora of other proteins have also been identified from yeast and human cells, i.e. TFTC, PCAF/GCN5, STAGA, and SAGA (11Bell B. Tora L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These complexes do not contain TBP or TBP paralogues, although they may participate in promoter recognition, transcription activation, and chromatin modifications. In addition, a TBP-TFIIA-containing complex (TAC) has recently been described in embryonic carcinoma cells that does not contain TAFIIs (12Mitsiou D. Stunnenberg H.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Despite their ability to mediate basal transcription on naked templates, the minimal set of Pol II transcription factors, including TFIID, are not sufficient for Pol II transcription on DNA templates packaged into chromatin (13Owen-Hughes T. Workman J.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 403-441PubMed Google Scholar, 14LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Science. 1998; 282: 1900-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Although the function of TBP and TFIID during basal transcription from naked DNA templates has been widely studied, their precise role during transcription on chromatin templates remains elusive. Here, we analyzed the transcriptional properties of TBP and TFIID on chromatin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChromatin AssemblyDrosophila embryo extracts were prepared, and chromatin was assembled essentially as described (15Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Typically, chromatin templates were assembled with 3 mg ofDrosophila S-190 extract, 1 μg of calf thymus core histones, 1 μg of supercoiled plasmid (see below), and an ATP regenerating system (30 mm creatine phosphate, 3 mm ATP, 4.2 mm MgCl2 and 6 μg of creatine kinase) in a 100– μl volume. After a 5-h incubation period, chromatin was either analyzed by micrococcal nuclease digestion or processed for transcriptional analysis.Transcription in VitroHeLa nuclear extract (NE) preparation and Gal4-VP16 purification have been described (16Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The heat inactivation of the NE (usually 300 μl) was carried out at 45 °C for 15 min as described in (17Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions were performed using 25 ng of 17M5/pAL7 (AdMLP+1) and 25 ng of pG1 (Glob+1) templates (16Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant TBP (16Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or immunopurified TFIID (18Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) were incubated with the templates for 10 min at 4 °C. Where indicated Gal-VP16 was preincubated with the templates for 10 min at 4 °C. Transcription reactions (25 μl) were performed with either normal or heat-inactivated NEs and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Transcription was initiated by the addition of NTPs (0.5 mm) and MgCl2 (5 mm) and carried out for 45 min at 25 °C. Specific transcripts were analyzed by S1 mapping (16Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and ImmunoblottingImmunoprecipitation was performed as described in (18Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using anti-hTBP, anti-hTAFII30, anti-hTAFII100, and anti-hTAFII135 mAbs by standard methods (19Wieczorek E. Brand M. Jacq X. Tora L. Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo analyze the role of TBP and TFIID during transcription initiation from naked or chromatin-assembled templates, first we normalized the amounts of TBP to be used in the reactions, either as recombinant TBP or immunopurified TFIID complex, by immunoblotting using a mAb raised against the recombinant human TBP (16Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). Then using equivalent units of TBP we compared the basal transcription activities of TBP and TFIID on naked templates from two different promoters (Fig. 1,A and C). As a source of remaining general transcription factors and other accessory factors we used a heat-treated HeLa cell NE in which the transcriptional activity of TBP and TFIID could be monitored (17Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Transcription in the heated NE was completely dependent upon the addition of TBP or TFIID (Fig.1 C). Equivalent units of TBP and TFIID resulted in comparable levels of basal transcription initiation from the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) (Fig. 1 C). However, TFIID-dependent basal transcription was more efficient from the rabbit β-globin promoter (Glob) than with TBP (in Fig.1 C, compare lanes 3–5 to 6–8 and in Fig. 2 E, lane 8 to9). Note, that transcription from the two templates have been carried out in the same reaction. Thus, our results show that on certain promoters TAFIIs can have a positive effect on transcription initiation from naked templates.Figure 2TBP-mediated basal transcription is not blocked on chromatin templates. A, outline of chromatin assembly and transcription assays. B, chromatin templates were digested with micrococcal nuclease and the DNA fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.M, 123-base pair DNA ladder. C, TBP- and TFIID-dependent chromatin transcription. AdMLP (AdMLP+1) and β-globin (Glob+1) promoter-containing templates were assembled in chromatin, equivalent units of TBP or TFIID were prebound to these templates, and then normal (NE, lane 1) or heat-inactivated nuclear extracts (NE45 °C, lanes 2–10) were added as indicated.D, TBP- and TFIID-dependent activated chromatin transcription. The AdMLP template contains 5 GAL4 binding sites upstream of the adenovirus major late minimal promoter. GAL4-VP16 was preincubated with the AdMLP and β-globin promoter-containing chromatin templates for 10 min before TBP or TFIID were added. The samples shown in panels C and D were analyzed on the same gel and thus exposed for the same time. E, TBP- and TFIID-dependent transcription in normal and heat-inactivated nuclear extracts on naked and chromatin templates.F, TBP-dependent chromatin transcription is blocked by sarcosyl at the level of reinitiation. Preinitiation assembly reactions were assembled as indicated in panel A. In lanes 5–8 sarcosyl was added 1.5 min after the addition of NTPs and MgCl2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, the AdMLP and the Glob templates were assembled into chromatin with an average nucleosome repeat length of 176 base pairs (±3 base pairs; data not shown), and the efficiency of chromatin assembly was monitored by micrococcal nuclease digestion (Fig. 2 B). To analyze the transcriptional properties of TBP and TFIID on chromatin templates, the chromatin-assembled AdMLP and the Glob templates had been preincubated with TBP or TFIID for 10 min prior to the addition of the heat-treated NE (Fig. 2 A). Surprisingly, recombinant TBP alone can mediate transcription initiation in a dose-dependent manner from the chromatin-assembled AdMLP and, to a lesser extent, from the β-globin promoter (Fig.2 C). In contrast, the same amount of TFIID that mediated efficient transcription initiation from naked DNA templates exhibited only a very minor enhancement of transcription from the chromatin-assembled AdMLP and globin promoters (lanes 7–10). However, on the chromatin-assembled AdMLP template that contains five GAL4 binding sites, the chimeric activator, Gal4-VP16, strongly stimulated TFIID-mediated transcription (Fig. 2 D,lanes 5–8). These results together suggest that TAFIIs can impair initiation of basal, but not activated, transcription when nucleated by TFIID on chromatin templates.To test whether efficient TBP-dependent transcription on chromatin was solely due to the heat treatment, we used either normal or heat-treated NEs (Fig. 2 E). DNA templates were assembled with chromatin or not and preincubated with TBP or TFIID for 10 min, and then the nontreated or the heat-treated NEs were added (Fig.2 E). Using the chromatin-assembled templates neither TBP or TFIID was able to recover or enhance transcription in the normal nuclear extract (Fig. 2 E, lanes 4–6). In contrast, in the heat-inactivated NE TBP mediated transcription from the chromatin templates (Fig. 2 E). Note that TBP-mediated transcription was much more efficient from the chromatin-assembled AdMLP template than from the Glob template (Fig. 2 C,lanes 3–6 and Fig. 2 E, lane 11), suggesting that the observed effect may be dependent on the TATA box of the promoter used. However, TFIID had only a weak effect on chromatin transcription when added to the heat-treated NE (Fig. 2 E). These results suggest that on certain promoters chromatin is permissive to transcription initiation mediated by TBP but not by TFIID and that the heat treatment may destabilize a chromatin-targeted repressor in the nuclear extract (see also “Discussion”).The action of TBP-mediated transcription on chromatin templates was further analyzed at the level of transcription initiation. To eliminate ongoing initiation in the transcription reaction, we performed single round transcription experiments on the chromatin-assembled AdMLP template. Transcription was initiated for 90 s by addition of NTPs, then sarcosyl was added to a final concentration of 0.08% to prevent de novo PIC formation as well as initiation at preformed PICs (20Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3452-3461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using nontreated NE no differences were observed on chromatin with or without sarcosyl in the absence of TBP and TFIID (Fig. 2 F). Moreover, in the heat-treated extract the low TFIID-dependent transcription levels were not influenced by sarcosyl (Fig. 2 F). However, a strong decrease was observed in the TBP-mediated transcription initiation on the chromatin template when using heat-treated NE (Fig. 2 F). Thus, on chromatin templates TBP and TFIID have little or no effect on single round basal transcription, but TBP seems to be involved in the maintenance of high levels of activator-independent reinitiation.Next we examined the effect of heat treatment of the NE on endogenous TFIID. Nuclear extracts were either kept on ice or heat inactivated at 45 °C before immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-TBP mAb, and TBP-associated proteins were analyzed by Western blot (Fig.3). In normal NE, several TAFIIs were coimmunoprecipitated together with TBP (Fig.3). In heat-treated nuclear extract TBP dissociated from TFIID because none of the tested TAFIIs (i.e.TAFII250, TAFII135, TAFII100, TAFII55, and TAFII30) were coimmunoprecipitated with TBP (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Thus, we hypothesize that after the dissociation from the TFIID complex, TBP loses its transcriptional activity because it undergoes a conformational change and/or a posttranslational modification. Moreover, it seems that all the other activities that have been reported to be able to mediate Pol II transcriptional initiation (TFTC, TAC, and other TBP-like factors (21Dantonel J.C. Wurtz J.M. Poch O. Moras D. Tora L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 335-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) are also heat inactivated in this extract.Figure 3Heat-treatment dissociates TBP from the TFIID complex. Nuclear extracts (NE) were heat-treated at 45 °C or kept at 4 °C. TBP-containing complexes immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-TBP mAb (α TBP) and associated proteins were tested by immunoblotting using anti-hTBP, anti-hTAFII135, anti-hTAFII100, and anti-hTAFII30 mAbs.

M,molecular mass marker in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur results demonstrate that chromatin per se is not refractory to activator-independent PIC formation and that subsequent transcription initiation on every promoter, such as TBP-dependent basal transcription, is almost as efficient on chromatin-assembled AdMLP template as it is on naked DNA in the heat-treated nuclear extract.The recent discovery of TAFII-independent and TAFII-dependent forms of TBP (9Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K. Science. 2000; 288: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and the TAC complex free of TAFIIs (12Mitsiou D. Stunnenberg H.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), give TBP function a new turn. Thus it is important to identify nuclear activities that regulate TBP-dependent (TAFII-independent) basal transcription. Binding of TBP to the TATA sequence seemed to be inhibited by nucleosomes, and this inhibition could be overcome by ATP-dependent alterations in nucleosomal DNA structure mediated by hSWI/SNF (22Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Here we show that TBP-mediated basal transcription on chromatin is blocked in a “normal” NE and that heat treatment can relieve this inhibition on certain promoters. Thus, it seems that a chromatin-targeted inhibitory factor exists in NE that blocks transcription initiation by the TAFII-independent forms of TBP only on chromatin. However, activators may relieve the repression by the inhibitory factor as TBP-dependent transcription can be stimulated in a normal NE (data not shown). FACT, a heat labile elongation factor that can relieve chromatin-mediated blocks and that blocks TBP-mediated transcription on naked DNA in the absence of TFIIE and TFIIH (23Orphanides G. Wu W.H. Lane W.S. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1999; 400: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 24Wada T. Orphanides G. Hasegawa J. Kim D.K. Shima D. Yamaguchi Y. Fukuda A. Hisatake K. Oh S. Reinberg D. Handa H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1067-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), may be a candidate for this inhibitory factor. Whether FACT and/or other yet unknown factors are required for this chromatin-targeted inhibitory activity remain to be determined. Alternatively, it is also conceivable that heat treatment causes dissociation of a nuclear multisubunit transcription complex, which subsequently releases a nonheat labile factor that facilitates the observed TBP-dependent basal transcription on chromatin.When TBP was co-incubated with heat-treated NE under chromatin transcription conditions, we were unable to co-purify TAFIIs together with TBP (data not shown). This observation together with the clear difference between the TBP- and TFIID-mediated transcription on chromatin and with the immunoprecipitation results suggest that TFIID does not reform under our assay conditions. Thus, the observed differences between TBP and TFIID are due to TAFII-independent versusTAFII-dependent transcription initiation on chromatin. In contrast to the TBP-mediated transcription initiation, the inability of TFIID to efficiently initiate basal transcription on chromatin may indicate that TAFIIs are able to exert negative effects on TBP-dependent basal transcription on chromatin or that TFIID is simply sterically excluded from chromatin. On naked templates TAFIIs have been reported to have negative effects on basal transcription (25Kokubo T. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3520-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Liu D. Ishima R. Tong K.I. Bagby S. Kokubo T. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. Nakatani Y. Ikura M. Cell. 1998; 94: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, under our assay conditions and on naked templates we have not observed negative effects by TAFIIs on basal transcription as TFIID was as active as free TBP. However, on chromatin templates TAFIIs seem to inhibit basal but not activated transcription as activators strongly stimulated TFIID-mediated transcription (Fig. 2 D). Thus, our data suggest that on chromatin TAFIIs may impair only TFIID-dependent basal transcription initiation.Emerging evidence suggest that reprogramming of chromatin and of TBP- and TBP-like factor-mediated transcription initiation during distinct developmental stages of embryogenesis, where fundamentally different chromatin states exist, are precisely regulated and coupled events (27Dantonel J.C. Quintin S. Lakatos L. Labouesse M. Tora L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 715-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,28Kaltenbach L. Horner M.A. Rothman J.H. Mango S.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 705-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our study thus identifies a potential contributor(s) to this regulation and provides mechanistic explanations toward the understanding of chromatin-regulated transcription initiation eventsin vivo.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of TFIID is followed by the subsequent ordered interactions of the other general transcription factors (TFIIA, -IIB, -IIE, -IIF, -IIH) and Pol II to yield a productive PIC (2Roeder R.G. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). TFIID is a protein complex composed of TBP and a number of TBP associated factors (TAFIIs) (3Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The discovery that TBP is not only a component of the TFIID complex but is also present in transcription complexes functioning in Pol I and III transcription, placed TBP as a central player in transcription (4Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). preinitiation complex RNA polymerase TATA-binding protein TBP associated factors TBP-TFIIA-containing complex nuclear extract monoclonal antibody, AdMLP, adenovirus major late promoter rabbit β-globin promoter In vitro recombinant TBP can substitute for TFIID in reconstituted basal transcription systems but does not support transcription from TATA-less promoters (5Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Moreover, in Drosophila and human cell-free systems TFIID but not TBP could support activator-dependent transcription. These findings suggested that TAFIIs are essential both for transcription initiation and for the response to transcriptional activators in vitro(3Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Evidence showing that TAFIIs may function as coactivators in vivo has come from either mammalian cell transfection experiments (6May M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.-C. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or from genetic studies inDrosophila (7Zhou J. Zwicker J. Szymanski P. Levine M. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13483-13488Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the above cell-free systems, activation of in vitro transcription in a TBP-dependent manner was reported in a TAFII-depleted nuclear extract (8Oelgeschlager T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Two active forms of TBP have been recently reported in yeast, a TAF-dependent and a TAF-independent form, that can mediate Pol II transcription in vivo (9Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K. Science. 2000; 288: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Novel complexes consisting of TAFIIs and a plethora of other proteins have also been identified from yeast and human cells, i.e. TFTC, PCAF/GCN5, STAGA, and SAGA (11Bell B. Tora L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These complexes do not contain TBP or TBP paralogues, although they may participate in promoter recognition, transcription activation, and chromatin modifications. In addition, a TBP-TFIIA-containing complex (TAC) has recently been described in embryonic carcinoma cells that does not contain TAFIIs (12Mitsiou D. Stunnenberg H.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite their ability to mediate basal transcription on naked templates, the minimal set of Pol II transcription factors, including TFIID, are not sufficient for Pol II transcription on DNA templates packaged into chromatin (13Owen-Hughes T. Workman J.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 403-441PubMed Google Scholar, 14LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Science. 1998; 282: 1900-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Although the function of TBP and TFIID during basal transcription from naked DNA templates has been widely studied, their precise role during transcription on chromatin templates remains elusive. Here, we analyzed the transcriptional properties of TBP and TFIID on chromatin. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChromatin AssemblyDrosophila embryo extracts were prepared, and chromatin was assembled essentially as described (15Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Typically, chromatin templates were assembled with 3 mg ofDrosophila S-190 extract, 1 μg of calf thymus core histones, 1 μg of supercoiled plasmid (see below), and an ATP regenerating system (30 mm creatine phosphate, 3 mm ATP, 4.2 mm MgCl2 and 6 μg of creatine kinase) in a 100– μl volume. After a 5-h incubation period, chromatin was either analyzed by micrococcal nuclease digestion or processed for transcriptional analysis.Transcription in VitroHeLa nuclear extract (NE) preparation and Gal4-VP16 purification have been described (16Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The heat inactivation of the NE (usually 300 μl) was carried out at 45 °C for 15 min as described in (17Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions were performed using 25 ng of 17M5/pAL7 (AdMLP+1) and 25 ng of pG1 (Glob+1) templates (16Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant TBP (16Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or immunopurified TFIID (18Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) were incubated with the templates for 10 min at 4 °C. Where indicated Gal-VP16 was preincubated with the templates for 10 min at 4 °C. Transcription reactions (25 μl) were performed with either normal or heat-inactivated NEs and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Transcription was initiated by the addition of NTPs (0.5 mm) and MgCl2 (5 mm) and carried out for 45 min at 25 °C. Specific transcripts were analyzed by S1 mapping (16Brou C."
https://openalex.org/W2004406821,"Abstract We have prepared a mutant RecA protein in which proline 67 and glutamic acid 68 in the NTP binding site were replaced by a glycine and alanine residue, respectively. The [P67G/E68A]RecA protein catalyzes the single-stranded DNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP and is able to promote the standard ATP-dependent three-strand exchange reaction between a circular bacteriophage φX174 (φX) single-stranded DNA molecule and a homologous linear φX double-stranded (ds) DNA molecule (5.4 kilobase pairs). The strand exchange activity differs from that of the wild type RecA protein, however, in that it is (i) completely inhibited by an ATP regeneration system, and (ii) strongly stimulated by the addition of high concentrations of ADP to the reaction solution. These results indicate that the strand exchange activity of the [P67G/E68A]RecA protein is dependent on the presence of both ATP and ADP. The ADP dependence of the reaction is reduced or eliminated when (i) a shorter linear φX dsDNA fragment (1.1 kilobase pairs) is substituted for the full-length linear φX dsDNA substrate, or (ii) the Mg2+ concentration is reduced to a level just sufficient to complex the ATP present in the reaction solution. These results indicate that it is the branch migration phase (and not the initial pairing step) of the [P67G/E68A]RecA protein-promoted strand exchange reaction that is dependent on ADP. It is likely that the [P67G/E68A]RecA mutation has revealed a requirement for ADP that also exists (but is not as readily apparent) in the strand exchange reaction of the wild type RecA protein."
