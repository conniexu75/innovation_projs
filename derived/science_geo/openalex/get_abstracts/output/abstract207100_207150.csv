Later, however, these axons showed strong radioactivity, which at 4 days was located in a proximal and at 16 days in a distal region of the nerve. It was concluded that the protein synthesized in the nerve cell bodies of the sciatic nerve had migrated along its axons."

Paralleling the action of insulin, ribonucleic acid accelerates oxidation of glucose (especially C-l), increases lipogenesis (notably glyceride-glycerol synthesis), and stimulates 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17.

No DDT or DDE was detected in any of the native Alaskan foods analyzed with the exception of two white owls, both of which contained low levels of DDE. Eskimos store considerably less DDT and DDE in their body fat than the general population in the United States. These low dietary levels and the resultant low levels in body fat are consistent with previously published data on the relationship between intake and storage of DDT."

https://openalex.org/W2042122128,"RECENTLY, Douglas and Rubin1 have suggested that acetylcholine, the physiological transmitter of sympathetic nerve effects at the adrenal medulla, evokes catecholamine secretion by causing calcium ions to penetrate the medullary cells. Our experiments with calcium-45 have now provided further evidence consonant with this idea."

https://openalex.org/W1975831308,"Reaction times of human subjects are reliably shorter when the signal to respond is given during spontaneous low voltage, fast (beta) brain waves than they are when the signal is given during spontaneous alpha waves. The mean difference of 12 milliseconds is, however, trivial in comparison to the advantage to be expected from forewarning."

https://openalex.org/W2083361012,"RECENTLY, we reported the induction of carcinomas of the fore stomach in rats by nitrosomethylurethane, given in the daily drinking water1. By intravenous injection, this substance proved to be extremely toxic, the LD50 being only 5 mg /kg body-weight. Repeated injections of 1 mg/kg every 9 days produced squamous epithelial- and alveolar cell-carcinomas of the lungs in all rats so treated2. The medium induction time was 400 days, the total amount administered per rat only 8–9 mg. The actual carcinogen is diazomethane3, easily formed from the unstable nitrosomethylurethane by hydrolysis. N-nitroso-N-methyl-p-toluene-sulphonamide, which is also used for the preparation of diazomethane4 but relatively stable, proved to be practically non-toxic and non-carcinogenic when given in the daily diet of rats over their whole life-span2."
https://openalex.org/W1832279874,"During all but the most recent years of the centuries of his existence man must have lived, reproduced, and died as other animals do. His increase in number was governed by the three great regulators of the increase of all species of plants and animals — predators, disease, and starvation — or, in terms more applicable to human populations — war, pestilence, and famine. One of the most significant developments for the future of mankind during the first half of the 20th century has been his increasing ability to control pestilence and famine. Although he has not freed himself entirely from the force of these two regulators of population increase, he has gained sufficient control of them so that they no longer effectively govern his increase in number."

https://openalex.org/W1969883868,"THE cytotoxic effect on mouse ascites tumour cells treated in vitro with various antibodies has been shown to require the presence of complement1,2. In the absence of complement the cells appear to be normal when viewed by phase contrast microscopy3; they retain their capacity to exclude trypan blue2 and to metabolize glucose4. The only changes which have been reported are slight alterations in the fine structure of the cell surface, which were thought to favour agglutination by rabbit antibody directed against ascites cells3."

Since neither the animal's thyroid nor the supplementary thyroxin is sufficient to effect substantial metamorphosis, genetic factors probably restrict the animal's ability to transform."

The hematologic and pathologic changes were reproduced by injection of anti-ribosomal serum into normal rabbits. The autoantibody specificity was related primarily to nucleotides and nucleosides."

In particular, some work in this field was undertaken in our laboratory6 with the main result that the yield of free radicals from γ-rays depends on the dose-rate."

https://openalex.org/W2058820849,"Cortisone-treated mice were inoculated with vaccinia virus, and then five paintings of methylcholanthrene were applied over the site of inoculation. In 70 percent of the mice, tumors developed at the site of inoculation, and 35 percent of the mice, with and without skin tumors, also developed lymphomas. Identically treated control mice that were vacciniaimmune developed a significantly lower incidence (38 percent) of both skin tumors and lymphomas"

Slow cooling in high concentrations (30 per cent) of glycerol1, moderately rapid cooling in plasma containing sugars2, and ultra-rapid cooling in low concentrations (6 per cent) of glucose3 have allowed high recoveries (90–95 per cent) of red cells of which 80–90 per cent survive at least 24 hr. when transfused."

https://openalex.org/W2040992742,"ROUS virus is known to consist of protein, ribonucleic acid (RNA) and lipid, about 40 per cent of which is in the form of phospholipids1,2. Partially purified preparations of the virus are inactivated by a wide range of lipid solvents—organic solvents, bile salts and synthetic detergents—and the loss of infectivity is associated with the shedding from the virus particles of protein-like material3."

https://openalex.org/W2008828475,"RECENTLY, Perretta and Thomson1 published a report on the marked stimulatory action exerted by a preparation of erythropoietin on the incorporation of formate labelled with carbon-14 into the bases of spleen and liver-slice nucleic acids. This same preparation, they reported, had no such action on marrow suspensions incubated under the same conditions. Since this finding appeared to offer a useful approach to the biochemical examination of the mechanism of action of erythropoietin and might also furnish a rapid sensitive in vitro assay for the hormone we undertook a confirmatory investigation. Instead of the extract of alcohol-precipitated urine from anæmic rabbits we used a partially purified sheep plasma fraction, with the results summarized here. These results do not confirm the findings of Perretta and Thomson."

They have named the organism isolated Bacillus salmonicida (Emmerich and Weibel). This is erroneous, as revealed by the description of characteristics given. Since the organism is Gram-negative, non-sporulating and able to ferment sugar to acid, it cannot belong to the genus Bacillus, which is defined as consisting of Gram-positive sporulating bacteria, obligate aerobe, with highly oxidative metabolism. The furunculosis organism was discovered by Emmerich and Weibel2 in 1894 and described as Bacterium salmonicida. This name has been in general use3–6 until in recent years when the organism was incorporated in the new genus Aeromonas Kluyver and Van Niel7,8."
