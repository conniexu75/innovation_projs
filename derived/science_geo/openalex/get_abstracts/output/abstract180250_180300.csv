https://openalex.org/W2154284135,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain transcriptional repression during development, likely by creating repressive chromatin states. The Extra Sex Combs (ESC) and Enhancer of Zeste [E(Z)] proteins are partners in an essential PcG complex, but its full composition and biochemical activities are not known. A SET domain in E(Z) suggests this complex might methylate histones. We purified an ESC-E(Z) complex from Drosophila embryos and found four major subunits: ESC, E(Z), NURF-55, and the PcG repressor, SU(Z)12. A recombinant complex reconstituted from these four subunits methylates lysine-27 of histone H3. Mutations in the E(Z) SET domain disrupt methyltransferase activity in vitro and HOX gene repression in vivo. These results identify E(Z) as a PcG protein with enzymatic activity and implicate histone methylation in PcG-mediated silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2075087486,"Enhancer of Zeste is a Polycomb Group protein essential for the establishment and maintenance of repression of homeotic and other genes. In the early embryo it is found in a complex that includes ESC and is recruited to Polycomb Response Elements. We show that this complex contains a methyltransferase activity that methylates lysine 9 and lysine 27 of histone H3, but the activity is lost when the E(Z) SET domain is mutated. The lysine 9 position is trimethylated and this mark is closely associated with Polycomb binding sites on polytene chromosomes but is also found in centric heterochromatin, chromosome 4, and telomeric sites. Histone H3 methylated in vitro by the E(Z)/ESC complex binds specifically to Polycomb protein."
https://openalex.org/W2101362932,"The assumption that each enzyme expresses a single enzymatic activity in vivo is challenged by the linkage of the neuronal enzyme ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) to Parkinson's disease (PD). UCH-L1, especially those variants linked to higher susceptibility to PD, causes the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in cultured cells, an effect that cannot be explained by its recognized hydrolase activity. UCH-L1 is shown here to exhibit a second, dimerization-dependent, ubiquityl ligase activity. A polymorphic variant of UCH-L1 that is associated with decreased PD risk (S18Y) has reduced ligase activity but comparable hydrolase activity as the wild-type enzyme. Thus, the ligase activity as well as the hydrolase activity of UCH-L1 may play a role in proteasomal protein degradation, a critical process for neuronal health."
https://openalex.org/W2102912401,"Cellular theories of memory consolidation posit that new memories require new protein synthesis in order to be stored. Systems consolidation theories posit that the hippocampus has a time-limited role in memory storage, after which the memory is independent of the hippocampus. Here, we show that intra-hippocampal infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin caused amnesia for a consolidated hippocampal-dependent contextual fear memory, but only if the memory was reactivated prior to infusion. The effect occurred even if reactivation was delayed for 45 days after training, a time when contextual memory is independent of the hippocampus. Indeed, reactivation of a hippocampus-independent memory caused the trace to again become hippocampus dependent, but only for 2 days rather than for weeks. Thus, hippocampal memories can undergo reconsolidation at both the cellular and systems levels."

We show that in the nuclear extracts IN exists as part of a large distinct complex with an apparent Stokes radius of 61 Å, which dissociates upon dilution yielding a core molecule of 41 Å. We isolated the IN complexes from cells expressing FLAG-tagged IN and demonstrated that the 41 Å core is a tetramer of IN, whereas 61 Å molecules are composed of IN tetramers associated with a cellular protein with an apparent molecular mass of 76 kDa. This novel integrase interacting protein was found to be identical to lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75), a protein implicated in regulation of gene expression and cellular stress response. HIV-1 IN and LEDGF co-localized in the nuclei of human cells stably expressing IN. Furthermore, recombinant LEDGF robustly enhanced strand transfer activity of HIV-1 IN in vitro. Our findings indicate that the minimal IN molecule in human cells is a homotetramer, suggesting that at least an octamer of IN is required to accomplish coordinated integration of both retroviral long terminal repeats and that LEDGF is a cellular factor involved in this process.

Moreover, stable integration into the human genome is the primary reason for the persistence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),1 which leads to AIDS. Therefore, HIV IN, the enzyme orchestrating the insertion of the DNA replica of the viral genome into the cellular chromosomal DNA, is an important target for antiretroviral therapy (1Debyser Z.

Mechanistically and structurally, retroviral integrases are similar to the well studied prokaryotic Mu phage and Tn5 transposases and belong to a family of DNA strand transferases that catalyze DNA cutting and joining via direct transesterification (reviewed in Refs. 4Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Antiviral Res. 1997; 36: 139-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 5Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Huges S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses.

In the course of retroviral infection, HIV IN performs two enzymatic reactions using the viral DNA as substrate. The first reaction is the removal of the 3′-GT dinucleotides from both LTRs (the 3′-end processing reaction). The second reaction is the insertion of the recessed viral DNA ends into the opposite strands of the target DNA, whereby the 3′ hydroxyls of the processed LTR ends attack two phosphodiester bonds in the target DNA molecule (the strand transfer or integration reaction).In vivo, insertion of the two viral LTRs takes place in a coordinated fashion across the major groove of the target DNA (concerted or full site integration). As a result, the integrated provirus is flanked by two 5-nucleotide gaps as well as two unmatched 5′-AC dinucleotides, which are then repaired by cellular enzymes. The stoichiometry of the native retroviral IN complex has not been established. Based on the available crystal structure information, it appears that at least a tetramer or even an octamer of IN would be necessary to accomplish concerted integration of both LTRs (8Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6667-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 9Wang J.Y. Ling H. Yang W. Craigie R.

The distance between the target DNA phosphates (∼18 Å) presents one important constraint for the modeling of the active IN multimer. Monomers, dimers, and tetramers were observed in preparations of recombinant HIV and avian sarcoma virus integrases (11Coleman J. Eaton S. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Laue T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32842-32846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Deprez E. Tauc P. Leh H. Mouscadet J.F. Auclair C. Brochon J.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16037-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of octamers and larger complexes has been suggested in some reports (15Lee S.P. Xiao J. Knutson J.R. Lewis M.S. Han M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9285-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Virion-associated HIV IN was also shown to be in a multimeric form, whereby dimers and higher order complexes appeared to be stabilized by disulfides, although the complexes were not studied under native conditions (17Petit C. Schwartz O. Mammano F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5079-5088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although recombinant HIV IN forms enzymatically active multimers (18Ellison V. Gerton J. Vincent K.A. Brown P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3320-3326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Engelman A. Bushman F.D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), reconstitution of the integration reaction in vitro using recombinant enzyme preparations results in predominantly uncoupled (half-site) integration of LTR DNA substrates. In vivo, retroviral DNA integration is preceded by the assembly of a stable and compact preintegration complex (PIC) that contains a DNA copy of the viral genome associated with viral and cellular proteins. Several cellular proteins have been suggested to play auxiliary roles during retroviral integration. Thus, barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) has been reported to protect Moloney murine leukemia virus PICs against suicidal self-integration (20Lee M.S. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Another cellular protein, HMG-I(Y) was found in HIV PICs and appeared to be essential for their integration activity in vitro (21Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 483-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 22Miller M.D. Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5382-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, BAF could substitute for HMG-I(Y) at least in vitro, partially restoring integration activity of salt-denatured HIV-1 PICs (23Chen H. Engelman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15270-15274Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Yet, it remains to be shown that BAF co-fractionates with retroviral PICs. Both BAF and HMG-I(Y) are small DNA-binding proteins able to bridge and deform DNA molecules and are thought to play structural roles within retroviral PICs, possibly by juxtaposing both LTRs. Similarly, Mu phage transposase and λ phage integrase require the DNA-bending host proteins IHF and/or HU to form committed synaptic complexes (7Mizuuchi K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1011-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar,24Friedman D.I. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Another potential co-factor for HIV integration, the integrase interactor 1 (Ini1), was originally discovered in a yeast two-hybrid screen for human proteins interacting with HIV-1 IN (25Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Cellular Ini1 is a subunit of the 2-MDa SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex (26Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Ini1 plays a role during retroviral replication by directing the PICs to open chromatin regions or by modulating expression of the integrated provirus. Recent studies demonstrated that green fluorescent protein-tagged Ini1 was exported from the nuclei of infected cells and co-localized with incoming subviral particles (27Turelli P. Doucas V. Craig E. Mangeat B. Klages N. Evans R. Kalpana G. Trono D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1245-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Ini1 has also been reported to enhance the release of infectious HIV particles (28Yung E. Sorin M. Pal A. Craig E. Morozov A. Delattre O. Kappes J. Ott D. Kalpana G.V. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Using a synthetic gene, we have been able to achieve efficient expression of HIV-1 IN in human cells (29Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P., De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar). We have now characterized HIV-1 IN protein complexes present in nuclear extracts from cells stably expressing this viral protein. We now report the first HIV integrase-interacting protein that forms a distinct complex with IN in human cells. Our results also provide an insight into the oligomeric state of intracellular HIV IN, indicating that the minimal cellular IN complex is a homotetramer. The HIV-1 integrase expression constructs were based on the episomal pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid pCEP-INsala is almost identical to the published pCEP-INs plasmid (29Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P., De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar), with the sole difference that the Gly codon in the second position of the synthetic open reading frame was mutated to Ala. As a result, the construct expressed native HIV-1 IN with an addition of Met-Ala dipeptide at the N terminus. To create the FLAG epitope-tagged IN expression construct pCEP-INsalaFLAG, the INs gene from pCEP-INsala was amplified in two consecutive steps with the sense primer 5′-GGCTAGATATCACTAGCAACCTCAAACAG plus the two antisense primers 5′-GTCGTCCTTGTAATCGCCGTCCTCATCTTGACGAGAG and 5′-GGCGCTCGAGTTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCGC; the resulting PCR fragment was digested with XhoI and cloned between thePvuII and XhoI sites of pCEP4. This plasmid expressed HIV-1 IN carrying the C-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). The plasmid pRP1012, for bacterial expression of His6-tagged HIV-1 IN, was a gift of Dr. R. Plasterk (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). To obtain pCP6H75, the plasmid used for bacterial expression of His6-tagged LEDGF, a DNA fragment coding for LEDGF/p75 was amplified from a sample of total HeLa RNA by reverse transcription-PCR using the primers 5′-GGCCGGATCCGACTCGCGATTTCAAACCTGGAGAC and 5′-CCGCGAATTCTAGTT ATCTAGTGTAGAATCCTTC. The PCR fragment was digested withBamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into pRSETB (Invitrogen). To prepare the mini-HIV DNA substrate for IN, the plasmid pU3U5 was digested with ScaI (30Cherepanov P. Surratt D. Toelen J. Pluymers W. Griffith J., De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2202-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The human embryonic kidney cells expressing SV40 large T antigen, 293T were obtained from Dr. O. Danos (Evry, France). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 20 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in 5% CO2humidified atmosphere. To establish stable cell lines, 293T cells were transfected by electroporation with the integrase expression constructs and selected with 200 μg/ml of hygromycin B (Invitrogen). For radioactive immunoprecipitation experiments, the cells were labeled in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum plus 0.1 mCi/ml of TRAN35S-LABEL (ICN Biomedicals, Asse-Relegem, Belgium) for 24 h. 293T-INsala or 293T-INsalaFLAG cells grown to a confluency of 80–90% were harvested by trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in modified CSK buffer (10 mmPipes pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2 plus the EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) (31Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) containing 100 mm NaCl (referred to as 100mCSK buffer). The cells were lysed for 10 min on ice with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the nuclei were pelleted and washed with 100mCSK. To extract IN, the nuclei were resuspended in 400mCSK buffer (same as 100mCSK, but containing 400 mm NaCl) and left on ice for 5 min; the chromatin was removed by centrifugation at 7,500 rpm for 2 min. The total protein content of the nuclear extracts was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The nuclear extracts were diluted using 400mCSK buffer to adjust the total protein concentration. DTSSP (Pierce) was dissolved in water immediately prior to the experiment. The cross-linking reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature and were terminated by the addition of ¼ volume of 4× SDS sample buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, and 40% (v/v) glycerol) and further incubation at room temperature for 20 min. Nuclear extracts and affinity-purified FLAG-tagged IN (INf) were fractionated on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences); 400mCSK buffer was used in all of the chromatography experiments. The column was operated at 0.6 ml/min, 4 °C and calibrated using low and high molecular weight gel filtration standards from Amersham Biosciences (blue dextran; thyroglobulin, R S/molecular mass 85 Å/669 kDa; ferritin, 61 Å/440 kDa; catalase, 52.2 Å/232 kDa; aldolase, 48.1 Å/158 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 35.5 Å/67 kDa; chymotrypsinogen A, 20.9 Å/25 kDa). The sample volume was kept at 200 μl; fractions of 300 μl were collected and analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-IN antibodies. When necessary, gel filtration fractions were concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. Stokes radii (R S) and approximate molecular masses of the IN complexes were determined from their experimental partition coefficients (K av) as described (32Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 112: 346-362Crossref Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The gradient 4–12 and 4–20% Novex Tris-glycine gels were purchased from Invitrogen. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad); detection was done with ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences). The rabbit polyclonal anti-HIV-1 IN antibody has been described previously (29Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P., De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich, the monoclonal anti-DNA-PKcs Ab-4 mixture was from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA), and the monoclonal anti-LEDGF p75/p52 was from BD Biosciences (Erembodegem, Belgium). The affinity purified anti-hMCM3 polyclonal antibody (33Schulte D. Burkhart R. Musahl C., Hu, B. Schlatterer C. Hameister H. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. R. Knippers (University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany). A combination of prestained molecular weight markers (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, UK) and Mark12 (Invitrogen) was used to estimate molecular weights of the cross-linking products and p76. DNA PKcs detected in a 293T nuclear lysate sample using the anti-DNA PKcs Ab4 antibody served as the 470-kDa marker in some Western blots. In the initial immunoprecipitation experiments, 30 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1–3 μg of the anti-FLAG M2 antibody was added to the nuclear extracts prepared in 400mCSK and diluted to obtain total protein concentration of 200 μg/ml. The suspension was stirred at 4 °C overnight (12–18 h). The agarose beads were washed once with 400mCSK and four times with 100mCSK plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The protein was eluted in 400mCSK buffer by the addition of 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) or in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. To purify INf-p76 complexes, immunoprecipitation was carried out using undiluted nuclear extracts (600–1000 μg/ml total protein) for 3–5 h. To identify the p76 protein by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry, the procedure was upscaled. 293T-INsalaFLAG cells grown to confluency on five 500-cm2 dishes (VWR International, Leuven, Belgium) were harvested and lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. IN complexes were extracted from the nuclear pellets into 13 ml of 400mCSK buffer and incubated with 300 μl of protein G-agarose beads and 40 μg of the anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 4.5 h. The INf complexes were eluted in 700 μl of 400mCSK buffer with 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide. Immunopurified INf-p76 complexes were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and redissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Approximately 3 μg of the p76 protein, electroblotted onto a Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) from an SDS-PAGE gel, was subjected to Edman degradation on a pulsed liquid phase Procise 491cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Lennik, Belgium). For mass spectrometry analysis the Coomassie Blue-stained band of p76 was cut from an SDS-PAGE gel, destained in a 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 50% acetonitrile, air-dried, and soaked in 8 μl of trypsin solution (16 ng of trypsin (Promega) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate) on ice for 20 min. Following overnight digestion at 37 °C, the supernatant was recovered, and the gel slice was extracted twice using 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. The extracts and the supernatant were pooled and dried in a Speedvac concentrator. The peptides were redissolved in 0.1% formic acid and analyzed by on-line nanoflow high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) on an UltiMate capillary LC system (LC-Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) coupled to a Q-Tof mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. All of the spectra were processed using the MassLynx and MaxEnt software delivered with the mass spectrometer. 293T-INsalaFLAG cells grown in Lab-Tek II glass chamber slides (VWR International) were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and permeabilized in ice-cold methanol. The cells were further blocked in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 20 mm ammonium chloride and 10% fetal calf serum and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (diluted 1:10.000 in phosphate-buffered saline, 10% fetal calf serum) (Sigma-Aldrich) and monoclonal anti-LEDGF (1:300) or anti-DNA PKcs (1:300) followed by Alexa-555 anti-rabbit and Alexa-488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). The nuclear DNA was labeled with 5 μm To-Pro3 iodide (Molecular Probes). Confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscopy and imaging was carried with an LSM510 system (Carl Zeiss, Zaventem, Belgium) using a 488-nm argon ion laser with a 505–530-nm band pass filter for Alexa-488, a 543-nm HeNe laser with a 565–615-nm filter for Alexa-555, and a 633-nm HeNe laser with a low pass 650-nm filter for ToPro-3. All of the acquisitions were done in the multi-track mode. The His6-tagged HIV-1 IN was produced from the plasmid pRP1012 in the Endo I-free hostEscherichia coli strain PC1 (BL21(DE3), ΔendA::TcR, pLysS) (30Cherepanov P. Surratt D. Toelen J. Pluymers W. Griffith J., De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2202-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The protein was purified from the soluble fraction by chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and Heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 7.5 mm CHAPS (Sigma-Aldrich). The His6 tag was removed by incubation of the purified protein with thrombin (Novagen). The His6-tagged LEDGF was expressed from the plasmid pCP6H75 in PC1 cells by induction with 1 mmisopropylthiogalactopyranoside in LB medium at 29 °C. The cells harvested 3 h post induction were disrupted using a French press in 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris pH 7.4. The soluble His6-tagged LEDGF protein was enriched by chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and further purified on a 1-ml HiTrap Heparin-Sepharose column (AmershamBiosciences). The protein was eluted from the Heparin-Sepharose column using a linear NaCl gradient in 30 mm Tris, pH 7.0. Peak fractions collected at ∼800 mm NaCl were pooled and concentrated using Centricon-30 (Millipore, Brussels, Belgium). The purified protein supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol and 10% glycerol was kept frozen at −80 °C. The 293T-INsala cell line used in this work was similar to the previously reported 293T-INs (29Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P., De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar), except that it expressed HIV-1 IN with the Met-Ala dipeptide (instead of Met-Gly) at its N terminus. This change was introduced to prevent potential myristoylation of the protein and did not affect either cell line stability or IN expression levels. The integrase protein was nuclear in both cell lines as determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown) (29Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P., De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar). After lysis of 293T-INsala cells with digitonin or Nonidet P-40 and centrifugation, most of the IN protein was retained in the nuclear pellet (Fig. 1 A). Nonidet P-40 permeabilizes both the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope. Hence, the bulk of IN present in the cell is stably associated with insoluble nuclear structures. IN could be readily extracted from the Nonidet P-40-permeabilized nuclei in high salt conditions (Fig. 1 B). We observed no elution of IN when nuclei prepared from 293T-INsala cells were treated with DNase I (Fig. 1 C) that completely digested nuclear DNA to fragments of less then 200 bp (data not shown). In accordance with Fujitaet al. (31Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), MCM3, a chromosomal replication factor, was removed from the nuclei by gentle DNase I treatment (Fig. 1 C). The same salt concentration was required to extract IN from the nuclease-digested nuclei (data not shown). However, exposure of the DNase-digested nuclei to low ionic strength conditions led to efficient elution of the protein (Fig. 1 D). Nondigested nuclei did not release any detectable amount of IN in the hypotonic medium (Fig. 1 D). These results indicate that IN is associated both with chromosomal DNA and with some other nuclear components, which are destabilized in low ionic strength conditions. Similar results were obtained when 293T-INsala nuclei were exposed to micrococcal nuclease (data not shown). We used DTSSP, an amine-specificN-hydroxysuccinimid ester, to cross-link protein complexes present in the nuclear extracts of 293T-INsala cells. The nuclear proteins were extracted from Nonidet P-40-permeabilized 293T-INsala nuclei using cytoskeleton (CSK) buffer supplemented with 400 mm NaCl. The total protein concentration was adjusted to 100, 20, and 4 μg/ml; the samples were incubated with DTSSP and separated in a nonreducing 4–12% SDS-PAGE gel. IN-containing cross-linking adducts were detected by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-IN antibodies. A typical result is shown in Fig. 2 A. In the non-cross-linked samples (lanes 2, 6, and10) as well as in the samples cross-linked in the presence of SDS (lane 1), only IN monomer and a band corresponding to IN dimer (∼60 kDa) were apparent. Addition of 0.1–2 mmDTSSP yielded cross-linked complexes of 60 kDa (p60cl), 150 kDa (the p150cl band, clearly visible in lanes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 13), 250–300 kDa (p300cl; lanes 4, 5, and9), and less resolved higher molecular mass species (lane 5). Strikingly, detection of the cross-linked IN complexes with our polyclonal anti-IN antibodies was far more sensitive than detection of the non-cross-linked IN. Probably some strong conformational epitopes were better preserved within cross-linked IN during SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Importantly, no unspecific bands were revealed in nuclear extracts from 293T cells before and after cross-linking with DTSSP, confirming that all of the bands detected in the Western blot correspond to IN-containing complexes (data not shown). The cross-linking of the 293T-INsala nuclear extract was clearly dependent on the concentration of both DTSSP and protein. Cross-linking of the diluted nuclear extract (4 μg/ml protein) with 2 mm DTSSP yielded the p150clband (lane 13), whereas in more concentrated extracts, p300cl was the most prominent (lane 5). Hence, there exist at least two different IN complexes: a large complex at higher protein concentrations and a smaller complex in the diluted extract. The p150cl product seems to be the result of complete cross-linking because no significant change in cross-linking occurs when the concentration of DTSSP was increased from 0.5 to 2 mm (compare lanes 12 and 13) and higher (data not shown). Thus, p150cl probably represents the IN complex present in the diluted nuclear extract. Moreover, this complex is a dissociation product and importantly, acomponent of the larger complex, because it appeared as a partial cross-linking adduct in the reactions with more concentrated protein extracts at 0.5 mm DTSSP, and it decreased at 2 mm DTSSP (compare lanes 4 and 5). However, the p300cl band is probably not the result of complete cross-linking of the larger complex, because a strong smear and some less resolved bands are present above p300cl on the Western blot; aggregated material not able to enter 4% polyacrylamide gel is also evident (lanes 5 and9). Some of the high molecular weight adducts in the reactions with 100 μg/ml extracts may result from nonspecific intermolecular cross-linking of proteins. Cross-linking of IN complexes in the nuclear extracts using oxidizing Cu2+-[1,10-phenanthroline]3 complex (Cys-Cys cross-linker) (34Ji T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 580-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) were also suggestive for the presence of a large protein complex that dissociated upon dilution, releasing a molecule with an apparent molecular mass of ∼120 kDa after cross-linking (data not shown). To confirm the presence of both IN complexes and deduce their size, we used gel filtration. Nuclear salt extracts from 293T-INsala cells were run on a calibrated Superdex 200 column, and the IN elution was followed by immunoblotting the collected fractions (Fig. 3 A). We observed two distinct elution volumes corresponding to two different IN complexes. Thus, after chromatography of the undiluted extract (600 μg/ml total protein), IN eluted symmetrically with a peak maximum in fractions 8 and 9 corresponding to the elution volume (V e) of a molecule with a Stokes radius (R S) of 61 Å (Fig. 3, A and B). However, IN behaved as a 41 Å molecule, when the sample was diluted 20-fold prior to gel filtration (Fig. 3, A and B). Assuming that both complexes are globular, their molecular mas"

To identify Ipl1p targets, we first purified 28 kinetochore proteins from yeast protein extracts. These studies identified five previously uncharacterized kinetochore proteins and defined two additional kinetochore subcomplexes. We then used mass spectrometry to identify 18 phosphorylation sites in 7 of these 28 proteins. Ten of these phosphorylation sites are targeted directly by Ipl1p, allowing us to identify a consensus phosphorylation site for an Aurora kinase. Our systematic mutational analysis of the Ipl1p phosphorylation sites demonstrated that the essential microtubule binding protein Dam1p is a key Ipl1p target for regulating kinetochore-microtubule attachments in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2113755074,"Local protein translation in dendrites could be a means for delivering synaptic proteins to their sites of action, perhaps in a spatially regulated fashion that could contribute to plasticity. To directly test the functional role of dendritic translation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha) in vivo, we mutated the endogenous gene to disrupt the dendritic localization signal in the mRNA. In this mutant mouse, the protein-coding region of CaMKIIalpha is intact, but mRNA is restricted to the soma. Removal of dendritic mRNA produced a dramatic reduction of CaMKIIalpha in postsynaptic densities (PSDs), a reduction in late-phase long-term potentiation (LTP), and impairments in spatial memory, associative fear conditioning, and object recognition memory. These results demonstrate that local translation is important for synaptic delivery of the kinase and that local translation contributes to synaptic and behavioral plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1989965174,"Three classes of neurons form synapses in the antennal lobe of Drosophila, the insect counterpart of the vertebrate olfactory bulb: olfactory receptor neurons, projection neurons, and inhibitory local interneurons. We have targeted a genetically encoded optical reporter of synaptic transmission to each of these classes of neurons and visualized population responses to natural odors. The activation of an odor-specific ensemble of olfactory receptor neurons leads to the activation of a symmetric ensemble of projection neurons across the glomerular synaptic relay. Virtually all excited glomeruli receive inhibitory input from local interneurons. The extent, odor specificity, and partly interglomerular origin of this input suggest that inhibitory circuits assemble combinatorially during odor presentations. These circuits may serve as dynamic templates that extract higher order features from afferent activity patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2061233919,"Learning of new information is transformed into long-lasting memory through a process known as consolidation, which requires protein synthesis. Classical theory held that once consolidated, memory was insensitive to disruption. However, old memories that are insensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors can become vulnerable if they are recalled (reactivated). These findings led to a new hypothesis that when an old memory is reactivated, it again becomes labile and, similar to a newly formed memory, requires a process of reconsolidation in order to be maintained. Here, we show that the requirement for protein synthesis of a reactivated memory is evident only when the memory is recent. In fact, memory vulnerability decreases as the time between the original training and the recall increases."
https://openalex.org/W2012299945,"The neurotrophin receptor p75 is induced by various injuries to the nervous system, but its role after injury has remained unclear. Here, we report that p75 is required for the death of oligodendrocytes following spinal cord injury, and its action is mediated mainly by proNGF. Oligodendrocytes undergoing apoptosis expressed p75, and the absence of p75 resulted in a decrease in the number of apoptotic oligodendrocytes and increased survival of oligodendrocytes. ProNGF is likely responsible for activating p75 in vivo, since the proNGF from the injured spinal cord induced apoptosis among p75(+/+), but not among p75(-/-), oligodendrocytes in culture, and its action was blocked by proNGF-specific antibody. Together, these data suggest that the role of proNGF is to eliminate damaged cells by activating the apoptotic machinery of p75 after injury."
https://openalex.org/W2005770471,"Endocytosis is a fundamental mechanism by which neurons control intercellular signaling, nutrient uptake, and synaptic transmission. This process is carried out by the assembly of clathrin coats and the budding of clathrin-coated vesicles from the neuronal plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate that in young neurons, clathrin assembly and disassembly occur rapidly, locally, and repeatedly at ""hot spots"" throughout dendrites and at the tips of dendritic filopodia. In contrast, clathrin coats in mature dendrites reside in stable, long-lasting zones at sites of endocytosis, where clathrin undergoes continuous exchange with local cytosolic pools. In dendritic spines, endocytic zones lie lateral to the postsynaptic density (PSD) where they develop and persist independent of synaptic activity, akin to the PSD itself. These results reveal the presence of a novel specialization dedicated to endocytosis near the postsynaptic membrane."

As such, functional MRI was used to determine the neural substrates of nicotine's effects on a sustained attention (rapid visual information-processing) task. Performance was associated with activation in a fronto-parietal-thalamic network in both smokers and nonsmokers. Along with subtle behavioral deficits, mildly abstinent smokers showed less task-induced brain activation in the parietal cortex and caudate than did nonsmokers. Transdermal nicotine replacement improved task performance in smokers and increased task-induced brain activation in the parietal cortex, thalamus, and caudate, while nicotine induced a generalized increase in occipital cortex activity. These data suggest that nicotine improves attention in smokers by enhancing activation in areas traditionally associated with visual attention, arousal, and motor activation."

In addition, we generated mice that express the inhibited form of alphaCaMKII, which resembles the persistently phosphorylated kinase at these sites. Our data demonstrate that blocking inhibitory phosphorylation increases CaMKII in the postsynaptic density (PSD), lowers the threshold for hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), and results in hippocampal-dependent learning that seems more rigid and less fine-tuned. Mimicking inhibitory phosphorylation dramatically decreased the association of CaMKII with the PSD and blocked both LTP and learning.

We demonstrate that spin is expressed in both nerve and muscle and is required both pre- and postsynaptically for normal synaptic growth. We have localized Spin to a late endosomal compartment and present evidence for altered endosomal/lysosomal function in spin. We also present evidence that synaptic overgrowth in spin is caused by enhanced/misregulated TGF-beta signaling. TGF-beta receptor mutants show dose-dependent suppression of synaptic overgrowth in spin. Furthermore, mutations in Dad, an inhibitory Smad, cause synapse overgrowth. We present a model for synaptic growth control with implications for the etiology of lysosomal storage and neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W2057428268,"Apoptosis induced by many stimuli requires the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) function. While studying the molecular mechanisms underlying this MRC-dependent apoptotic pathway, we find that apoptosis in multiple cell types induced by a variety of stimuli is preceded by an early induction of MRC proteins such as cytochrome c (which is encoded by a nuclear gene) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX II) (which is encoded by the mitochondrial genome). Several non-MRC proteins localized in the mitochondria, e.g. Smac, Bim, Bak, and Bcl-2, are also rapidly up-regulated. The up-regulation of many of these proteins (e.g. cytochrome c, COX II, and Bim) results from transcriptional activation of the respective genes. The up-regulated cytosolic cytochrome c rapidly translocates to the mitochondria, resulting in an accumulation of holocytochrome c in the mitochondria accompanied by increasing holocytochrome c release into the cytosol. The increased cytochrome c transport from cytosol to the mitochondria does not depend on the mitochondrial protein synthesis or MRC per se. In contrast, cytochrome c release from the mitochondria involves dynamic changes in Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g. up-regulation of Bak, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL), opening of permeability transition pore, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Overexpression of cytochrome c enhances caspase activation and promotes cell death in response to apoptotic stimulation, but simple up-regulation of cytochrome c using an ecdysone-inducible system is, by itself, insufficient to induce apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that apoptosis induced by many stimuli involves an early mitochondrial activation, which may be responsible for the subsequent disruption of MRC functions, loss of Δψm, cytochrome c release, and ultimately cell death.

Electrons from reducing substrates such as NADH and succinate are transferred from complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), respectively, to ubiquinone, to complex III (cytochrome c reductase), to cytochromec, to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase or COX), and finally to O2. The electron transport through complexes I, III, and IV is accompanied by the pumping of protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space, where the protons establish a mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) by forming a proton and a pH gradient. The reverse flow of the protons from the intermembrane space into the matrix drives another multiprotein complex, F0F1-ATPase (or complex V), to produce ATP. The protein subunits in complexes I, III, IV, and V are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, thus necessitating smooth communications between and coordinated gene expressions from two genomes (1Poyton R.O.

Two apoptotic pathways are relatively well understood at the molecular level. In the intrinsic (or mitochondrial) pathway, apoptotic signaling somehow impacts mitochondria such that the mitochondrial cytochrome c is released into the cytosol, where it binds to the adaptor protein Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, leading to the formation of apoptosome and subsequent activation of “executioner” caspases such as caspase-3, -6, or -7 (26Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the extrinsic pathway, engagement of the cell surface death receptors (e.g. Fas, TNFR1, DR-3, DR-4, and DR-5) results in the activation of initiator caspase-8 through adaptor proteins such as FADD and TRADD (27Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar), which then activates downstream executioner caspases. The death receptor pathway can be amplified by the mitochondrial pathway either through the translocation of tBid, a caspase 8 cleavage product of Bid, to the mitochondria, which induces cytochromec release (28Li H.

Akiyama V. Kitoh T. Furusho K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5243-5245PubMed Google Scholar). Deficiency in complex IV in colon carcinoma cells renders them resistant to apoptosis induction (35Heerdt B.G. Houston M.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 523-532PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, F0F1-ATPase is required for Bax-induced apoptosis (45Matsuyama S., Xu, Q. Velours J. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanisms underlying this MRC-dependent apoptosis remain unclear. Here we report that apoptosis induced by BMD188, a chemical that causes cell death in an MRC-dependent manner (37Joshi B., Li, L. Taffe B.G. Zhu Z. Wahl S. Tian H. Ben-Josef E. Taylor J.D. Porter A.T. Tang D.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4343-4355PubMed Google Scholar), involves an early up-regulation of MRC proteins (in particular, cytochrome c) prior to caspase activation and cell death. Importantly, this phenomenon seems to represent a general early apoptotic response as it is also observed in multiple cell types induced to die by a variety of stimuli.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and ReagentsHuman osteosarcoma cells 143B(TK−) (143B) and fibroblasts GM701.2-8C (GM701) and their respective mtDNA-less, respiration-deficient ρ0 derivatives 143B206 and GM701.2–8C (2Eguchi Y.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2976-2981PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were treated with various chemicals or vehicle (ethanol or Me2SO) control. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D (A/D), or mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibitor tetracycline before apoptosis induction. At the end of the treatment, cells were harvested by scraping, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 600 μl of homogenizing buffer (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mmsodium EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 250 mm sucrose and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml chymostatin). After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells were homogenized in the same buffer using a glass Pyrex homogenizer (type A pestle, 140 strokes). Unbroken cells, large plasma membrane pieces, and nuclei were removed by centrifuging the homogenates at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to obtain mitochondria. The remaining supernatant was again subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosolic fraction (i.e. S100 fraction). The mitochondrial pellet was washed three times in homogenizing buffer, and then solubilized in TNC buffer (10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm CaCl2) containing protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined by Micro-BCA kit (Pierce).For Western blotting, 25 μg of proteins (mitochondrial or cytosolic fractions) was loaded in each lane of a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After gel electrophoresis and protein transfer, the membrane was probed or reprobed, after stripping, with various primary and corresponding secondary antibodies (37Joshi B., Li, L. Taffe B.G. Zhu Z.

Commun. 1998; 242: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Caspase-3 ActivationCaspase-3 cleavage (activation) was analyzed by Western blotting. Cells were lysed in TNC lysis buffer, and 100 μg of whole cell lysates was separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. After protein transfer, the blot was probed with a monoclonal antibody for caspase-3. The activation of caspase-3 was monitored by a decrease or disappearance of the ∼32-kDa procaspase-3 (37Joshi B., Li, L. Taffe B.G. Zhu Z. Wahl S. Tian H. Ben-Josef E. Taylor J.D. Porter A.T. Tang D.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4343-4355PubMed Google Scholar).DEVDase and LEHDase ActivityCells were washed twice in PBS, and the whole cell lysates were made in the lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA). Forty μg of protein was added to a reaction mixture containing 30 μm fluorogenic peptide substrates, DEVD-AFC or LEHD-AFC, 50 mm of HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.1% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, in a total volume of 1 ml and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Production of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) was monitored in a spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer) using excitation wavelength 400 nm and emission wavelength 505 nm. The fluorescent units were converted into nanomoles of AFC released per h per mg of protein using a standard curve. The results were generally presented as fold activation over the control.DNA FragmentationFragmented DNA was extracted using SDS/RNase/proteinase K methods (37Joshi B., Li, L. Taffe B.G. Zhu Z.

Commun. 1998; 242: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and 20 μg of DNA was run on 1.2% agarose gel.Quantification of Apoptotic Nuclei Using DAPI StainingCells were plated on glass coverslips (4 × 104 cells/18-mm2 coverslip) and the next day treated with vehicle control (i.e. ethanol or Me2SO) or various inducers. Thereafter, cells were incubated live with DAPI (0.5 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C followed by washing. The percentage of cells exhibiting apoptotic nuclei, as judged by chromatin condensation or nuclear fragmentation, was assessed by fluorescence microscopy (49Tang D.G., Li, L. Chopra D.P. Porter A.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3466-3479PubMed Google Scholar). An average of 600–700 cells was counted for each condition.Immunofluorescence Analysis of Cytochrome c Distribution, Mitochondrial Membrane Potential, and ApoptosisCells grown on glass coverslips were treated for various time intervals. Fifteen min prior to the end of the treatment, cells were incubated live with MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos to label mitochondria (37Joshi B., Li, L. Taffe B.G. Zhu Z. Wahl S. Tian H. Ben-Josef E. Taylor J.D. Porter A.T. Tang D.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4343-4355PubMed Google Scholar). Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by permeabilization in 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After washing in PBS, cells were first blocked in 20% goat whole serum for 30 min at 37 °C and then incubated with monoclonal anti-cytochromec antibody (clone 6H2.B4, 1:500) for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) for 1 h at 37 °C. After thorough washing, coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and observed under an Olympus BX40 epifluorescence microscope. Images were captured with MagnaFire software and processed in Adobe Photoshop. In a separate set of samples, following apoptotic treatments, cells were washed once with 1× PBS and then incubated in the Annexin-Binding Buffer containing annexin V-AlexaFluor conjugates for 30 min followed by washing. Images were captured on an Olympus IX50 inverted fluorescence microscope.RT-PCR Analysis of Cytochrome c and COX II mRNA ExpressionTotal RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent (Invitrogen). RT was performed using 2 μg of total RNA (at 42 °C for 2 h) in a total 20-μl reaction volume containing random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR primers, designed based on the published cytochrome c and COX II cDNA sequences, are 5′-TTTGGATCCAATGGGTGATGTTGAG-3′ (cytochromec, sense), 5′-TTTGAATTCCTCATTAGTAGCTTTTTTGAG-3′ (cytochromec, antisense), 5′-CCATCCCTACGCATCCTTTAC-3′; (COX II, sense), and 5′-GTTTGCTCCACAGATTTCAGAG-3′ (COX II, antisense). For PCR, 1 μl of cDNA was used in a 25-μl reaction containing 0.5 μm primers, dNTPs and Taq, using the cycling profile 94 °C × 45 s, 56 °C × 1 min, and 72 °C × 1 min for 14 cycles for COX II and 23 cycles for cytochrome c with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel. RT-PCR of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (50Tang D.G. Tokumoto Y.M. Raff M.C. J.

GM701 cells, plated 1 day earlier on 10-cm culture dishes to achieve 50–60% confluence, were transfected, using FuGENE 6, with 15 μg of either empty vector alone or pEGFP-cytochrome c. Twenty four h after transfection, cells were treated with BMD188 for various times and then harvested and used for subcellular fractionations as described above. To assess apoptosis, GM701 cells grown on coverslips were transfected with 1 μg of plasmids. Twenty four h later, cells were treated with BMD188 followed by DAPI staining as described above. The percentage of GFP-positive and -negative cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology was determined by fluorescence microscopy (49Tang D.G., Li, L. Chopra D.P. Porter A.T.

Here, we explore the mechanism whereby PKC activates PKD in response to cellular stimuli. We first assessed in vitroPKC-PKD transphosphorylation and PKD activation. A PKD738–753 activation loop peptide was well phosphorylated by immunoprecipitated PKC isoforms, consistent with similarities between the loop and their known substrate specificities. A similar peptide with glutamic acid replacing Ser748 was preferentially phosphorylated by PKCε, suggesting that PKD containing phosphate at Ser748is rapidly targeted by this isoform at Ser744. When incubated in the presence of phosphatidylserine, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate and ATP, intact PKD slowly autophosphorylated in the activation loop but only at Ser748. In contrast, addition of purified PKCε to the incubation mixture induced rapid Ser744 and Ser748 phosphorylation, concomitant with persistent 2–3-fold increases in PKD activity, measured using reimmunoprecipitated PKD to phosphorylate an exogenous peptide, syntide-2. We also further examined pleckstrin homology domain-mediated PKD regulation to determine its relationship with activation loop phosphorylation. The high constitutive activity of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain deletion mutant PKD-ΔPH was not abrogated by mutation of Ser744 and Ser748 to alanines, suggesting that one function of activation loop phosphorylation in the PKD activation mechanism is to relieve autoinhibition by the PH domain. These studies provide evidence of a direct PKCε-PKD phosphorylation cascade and provide additional insight into the activation mechanism.

The ten distinct PKC isoforms thus far identified by molecular cloning comprise three subfamilies differing in structure and regulation (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar, 3Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem.

Classical (α, βI, βII, and γ) and novel (δ, ε, η, and θ) PKCs are allosterically stimulated by diacylglycerol, produced rapidly in response to increased activity of phospholipase C/D enzymes (5Noh D.Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 6Exton J.H. Physiol.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2362) Google Scholar). Classical PKCs also possess functional Ca2+-binding sites that mediate sensitivity to Ca2+ signals (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). In contrast, atypical (ι/λ and ζ) PKCs respond to 3′-phosphorylated inositol phospholipids (8Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but do not bind diacylglycerol/phorbol esters or Ca2+. PKCs are implicated as mediators of a diverse array of biological functions, including both short term alterations in cellular activities and the long term determination of cell fate (9Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKC isoforms exhibit distinct expression patterns, and in response to signaling events, become dynamically targeted to discrete subcellular locations and anchored in positions adjacent to substrates (10Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 11Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This differential dynamic localization, as well as intrinsic substrate selectivity (12Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

However, despite their recognized importance in signal transduction, few links have been established between individual PKC isozymes and the direct targets that specify their individual biological outcomes.

Salient features of PKD structure and function include an N-terminal regulatory domain comprising a putative transmembrane region, a diacylglycerol/phorbol ester binding cysteine-rich domain, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain with a primary sequence and substrate specificity divergent from those of PKCs. Like the classical and novel PKCs, PKD catalytic activity is stimulated in vitro by diacylglycerol or biologically active phorbol esters (17Van Lint J.V. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich domain and PH domain both play a role in the negative regulation of PKD catalytic activity, because deletion of either of these domains produces a constitutively active enzyme (18Iglesias T.

Throughout all these studies, multiple lines of evidence have indicated that PKC activity is indispensable for PKD activation by cellular stimuli. Cell treatments with phorbol esters or other agents that bypass surface receptors and directly stimulate PKCs are potent triggers of cellular PKD activation (20Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J.

Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17114-17121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKD interacts preferentially with PKCη, forming complexes involving the PH domain (36Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These findings imply the existence of PKC-PKD protein kinase cascade(s), and we have postulated that some PKC-dependent biological effects involve PKD acting either in parallel or as a downstream intermediate. In particular, PKD has been reported recently to mediate several important cellular activities and processes, including function and organization of the Golgi apparatus (39Liljedahl M. Maeda Y.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2154-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism whereby PKC activates PKD has been attracting intense interest. Our previous studies identified Ser744 and Ser748 in the PKD activation loop as phosphorylation sites critical for PKC-mediated PKD activation. Whereas a PKD mutant with Ser744 and Ser748 mutated to alanines (PKD-S744A/S748A) could not be activated by cellular stimuli, a mutant with these residues mutated to glutamic acid residues (PKD-S744E/S748E) possessed dramatically increased constitutive activity (50Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have shown that Ser744 and Ser748 are phosphorylatedin vivo during PKD activation in response to phorbol ester stimulation, in a manner blocked by preincubation with GF 109203X (50Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar,51Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Specifically, in two-dimensional 32P tryptic phosphopeptide maps, individual spots were selectively eliminated when PKD forms point-mutated at Ser744 or Ser748were used in transfections (50Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because kinase-deficient PKD, which retains Ser744 and Ser748, also became phosphorylated during stimulation with phorbol ester, we concluded that transphosphorylation at these sites by an upstream kinase,e.g. novel PKCs, was a critical factor responsible forin vivo PKD activation (50Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 51Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A different group of researchers (52Vertommen D. Rider M., Ni, Y. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Van Lint J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19567-19576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have questioned the role of activation loop transphosphorylation in the PKD activation mechanism. Consequently, we reinvestigated PKD activation loop phosphorylation using phosphospecific antisera generated against phosphorylated Ser744 and Ser748 (34Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In these studies, we demonstrated that Ser744 and Ser748phosphorylation were concomitant with activation, induced by either a variety of receptor-mediated or -independent stimuli or by transfection of PKCε or PKCη in the absence of cell stimulation. These approaches also produced phosphorylation of kinase-deficient PKD forms at both Ser744 and Ser748, supporting the view that PKC, but not PKD, activity induced phosphorylation of these residues. However, the precise mechanisms involved remain unclear (20Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar,36Waldron R.T.

In the present study, we use peptides, full-length PKD, and mutant PKD proteins to examine whether PKC mediates direct PKD activation loop Ser744 and Ser748phosphorylation and activation. Stock cultures of COS-7 cells were maintained in 10-cm tissue culture plates by subculturing every 3–4 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37 °C. Confluent stock cells were reseeded at a density of 6 × 104 cells/ml in 6-cm dishes, 8–18 h prior to transfections. All transfections and cotransfections were carried out with equivalent amounts of DNA (5 μg/dish for single transfections, 3 μg/dish of each DNA for cotransfections), using vector pcDNA3 as the control DNA added to single transfections. Transfections were carried out in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) at 10 μl/dish. DNA-Lipofectin complexes were formed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer and then cell cultures were layered over with these DNA complexes in a final volume of 2.5 ml/dish in the absence of serum and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, for 5–6 h or overnight to allow uptake of complexes. Fetal bovine serum (10% final concentration) in Opti-MEM was then added to dishes to yield a final volume of 5 ml/dish. Cells were used for experiments after a further 72 h of incubation. Plasmid constructs encoding PKCs and wild-type and mutant PKD forms used in this study have been described previously (17Van Lint J.V. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 18Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Thus, a Bsu36I restriction fragment within pcDNA-PKDΔPH (nucleotides 2305–2827 of PKD) was replaced with a corresponding Bsu36I fragment excised from pcDNA3-PKD-S744A/S748A. The GST-Cat and GST-Cat/S744A/S748A fusion proteins were constructed in pGEX-4T by standard subcloning procedures. Thus, C-terminal BamHI fragments (corresponding to amino acids 559–918) of either wild-type PKD or PKD-S744A/S748A were fused in-frame at the C-terminal of the sequence encoding glutathioneS-transferase in the construct pGEX-4T (AmershamBiosciences). Fusion proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and eluted with 10 mm glutathione. COS-7 cells transfected either with wild-type or mutant PKD or PKC isoforms were treated as indicated in the figures and then lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Small amounts (typically 1/10) of these total lysates were saved and combined with equal volumes of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) for Western blot analysis. To generate PKC or PKD immunoprecipitates, medium was removed, and lysis buffer was added to cells on ice. These lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, and the cleared supernatants were combined with antibodies and protein A-agarose (30 μl) and placed on a rotator at 4 °C for 3 h. Immune complexes were collected by brief spinning and washed thoroughly before subsequent kinase assays. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitations were either the isoform-specific antisera from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (for PKCε, PKCη, or PKCζ) or the previously described PA-1 antiserum (17Van Lint J.V. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) for PKD (1:100 dilution). For assays of peptide phosphorylation by PKD or PKCs, immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and then twice with kinase buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Substrate peptides (ε-peptide, syntide-2, PKD738–754, PKD-738–754/S744E, PKD-738–754/S748E, or the PKD C-terminal peptide EEREMKALSERVSIL used to generate PA-1 antiserum, termed PKD CT, each at a final concentration of 2.0 mg/ml), were then added in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi/reaction diluted with cold ATP to give a final concentration of 100 μm) in kinase buffer (final reaction volume, 30 μl) and transferred to a water bath at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 100 μl of 75 mmH3PO4, and 75 μl of the mixed supernatant was spotted to Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Papers were washed thoroughly in 75 μm H3PO4 and dried, and radioactivity incorporated into peptides was determined by detection of Cerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter. PS/PDB phospholipid vesicles used for assays of peptide or protein phosphorylation by PKD or PKCε were prepared by dehydrating 300 μg of PS under ethanol (200 μl) in a Speedvac dehydrator and then sonicating the dried lipid into kinase buffer (typically 300 μl) in the presence of added PDB and 0.05% nonionic detergent (Triton X-100). For assays of syntide-2 phosphorylation by purified PKD or PKCε, fresh aliquots (typically 2 μg) of enzyme were thawed on ice, combined with PS/PDB vesicles (final concentrations, 200 μg/ml and 200 nm, respectively, in kinase buffer), and aliquoted to tubes on ice containing kinase buffer with or without inhibitors as indicated in the figures. Reactions were initiated by adding a mixture containing syntide-2 (final concentration, 2 mg/ml), together with 100 μm ATP (including [γ-32P]ATP at 2 μCi/assay), and then transferring to a water bath at 30 °C for 7 min. Reactions were terminated by adding H3PO4as above, spotted to P-81 paper, and washed, and radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter as above. For transphosphorylation of full-length wild-type or kinase-defective PKD proteins by PKCε, we transfected COS-7 cells with PKD or PKD-K618N. After 72 h, cells were lysed, and PKD protein was isolated in immune complexes using PA-1. In each experiment, parallel dishes were included to examine the persistence of PKD activation throughout immunoprecipitation, elution from immunocomplexes, and subsequent reimmunoprecipitation. PKD or PKD-K618N immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells were washed twice with lysis buffer and then twice with kinase buffer. The PKD-PA-1 immune complexes were then incubated with immunizing peptide (15 μg in ∼15 μl of kinase buffer) overnight on ice to elute PKD proteins. For transphosphorylation reactions, the supernatant containing eluted PKD protein was transferred to fresh tubes on ice, adjusted to 20 μl, ATP (100 μm) was added on ice, and then reactions were initiated by mixing in purified PKCε (Calbiochem) for a final concentration of 5.8 μg/ml, combined with PS/PDB vesicles (either with or without 3 μm Gö6983), and transferred to a 37 °C water bath. Reactions were terminated at 2.5 min by adding 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and were transferred to ice. PKD antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then added, and PKD was reimmunoprecipitated for 3 h, washed as before, and then subjected to syntide-2 assays in the presence of 3 μm Gö6983. Activation assays using purified PKCε to transphosphorylate purified PKD (Calbiochem) were conducted similarly beginning with the addition of ATP to purified PKD in kinase buffer (20 μl). For measurements of PKCε transphosphorylation/PKD autophosphorylation by 32P incorporation, purified components (PKD (200 ng), alone or with PKCε (70 ng) or PKCζ (70 ng) in the absence of PS/PDB vesicles, or PKD (250 ng), alone or with PKCε (150 ng), in the presence of PS/PDB vesicles and kinase buffer) were combined in microcentrifuge tubes (final volume, 20 μl) on ice. To initiate reactions, ATP at 100 μm with or without 1 μCi of [γ−32P]ATP/assay was added and incubated at 30 °C for times indicated in the figures. Reactions were terminated by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels. Protein phosphorylation was assessed by autoradiography of dried gels. For detection of PKCε transphosphorylation/PKD autophosphorylation at the PKD activation loop by Western blot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies, components (PKD, 275 ng/lane, with or without PKCε, 175 ng/lane, were combined in the presence of PS/PDB vesicles and incubated at 37 °C. At times indicated in the figures, aliquots were taken and combined with SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer for subsequent Western analysis. Autophosphorylation or syntide-2 phosphorylation reactions to assess activity of the PKD-ΔPH-S744A/S748A mutant were conducted as described previously for PKD activity measurements (28Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17114-17121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were transfected with the different plasmids. After 72 h, cells were left untreated or treated with PDB (200 nm for 10 min) and then lysed, and PKD or"

ZOPs bind to the cytoplasmic C termini of junctional transmembrane proteins linking them to the actin cytoskeleton. They are characterized by several conserved modules, including three PDZ domains, one SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase-like domain, elements indicating that ZOPs may serve multiple purposes. Interestingly, ZOPs contain some unique motifs not shared by other MAGUK family members, including nuclear localization and nuclear export signals and a leucine zipper-like sequence. Their potential involvement in cell growth and proliferation has been suggested earlier based on the observation that the N-terminal half of ZOPs displays significant similarity to the product of the Drosophilatumor suppressor gene lethal(1)discs-large (dlg). The nuclear targeting of ZOPs in subconfluent epithelial cell cultures is well documented, although the action of the junctional MAGUKs in the nucleus has remained elusive. Here we show for the first time that nuclear ZO-2 directly interacts with the DNA-binding protein scaffold attachment factor-B (SAF-B). Our results from two-hybrid assays and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation studies provide evidence to suggest that ZO-2 associates with the C-terminal portion of SAF-B via its PDZ-1 domain. We further demonstrate that enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)- and DsRed-tagged ZO-2 and SAF-B fusion proteins partially co-localize in nuclei of transfected epithelial cells. As shown by laser confocal microscopy and epifluorescent analysis, nuclear ZO-2 is present in epithelial and endothelial cells, particularly in response to environmental stress conditions.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 10Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol.

The observation that ZOPs not only associate with each other but also with components of adherens junctions and gap junctions in cells lacking TJs (12Howarth A.G. Stevenson B.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1995; 31: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Giepmans B.N. Moolenaar W.H. Curr.

A. 1991; 88: 3460-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) suggests a universal role for ZOPs at the cytoplasmic surface of the junctional plaque. ZOPs are structurally similar to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologue (MAGUK) family of signaling molecules (for review see Refs. 15Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar and 16Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These multidomain proteins contain a core of specific modules composed of three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, a terminal acidic domain, and an enzymatically inactive guanylate kinase-like domain. Apart from theses classical MAGUK domains, ZOPs contain some unique motifs not shared by other MAGUK family members, including nuclear localization and nuclear export signals and a leucine zipper (16Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The first MAGUK identified was the product of the Drosophilatumor suppressor gene lethal(1)discs-large (dlg), defining the subfamily of dlg-like MAGUKS, which also includes the mammalian synaptic density protein PSD-95/SAP90. The dlggene was actually identified by the tumorous overgrowth seen in the imaginal discs of larvae carrying loss-of-function mutations (17Woods D.F., Wu, J.W. Bryant P.J. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Woodhouse E. Hersperger E. Shearn A. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 207: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mammalian ZOPs, comprising ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3, and theDrosophila Tamou, constitute the ZO-1-like MAGUK subfamily. Mammalian members of this subfamily localize at TJs, whereas theDrosophila member localizes at septate junctions. ZO-1 (220 kDa) was the first protein suggested to be associated with TJs of epithelial and endothelial cells (19Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 20Anderson J.M. Stevenson B.R. Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). ZO-1 is particularly enriched at the TJs of epithelial and endothelial cells but has also been found in astrocytes, fibroblasts, sarcoma, and myeloma cell lines (for review see Ref. 16Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). ZO-2, a 160-kDa phosphoprotein is highly homologous to ZO-1 and was found to co-precipitate with ZO-1 in epithelial cells (14Gumbiner B. Lowenkopf T. Apatira D Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3460-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 21Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). ZO-2 has a similar domain structure to ZO-1, but the two proteins diverge at the C terminus, where ZO-2 contains an alternatively spliced region called the β-motif (22Beatch M. Jesaitis L.A. Gallin W.J. Goodenough D.A. Stevenson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25723-25726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Finally, the 130-kDa protein ZO-3, originally described as p130, has been added to the list. ZO-3 shows high homology to ZO-1 and ZO-2 but contains a unique proline-rich region located between the second and third PDZ domain (23Haskins J., Gu, L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). So far, no alternatively spliced domain has been detected in ZO-3. Further, ZO-3 directly interacts with ZO-1 and the cytoplasmic domain of occludin, but not with ZO-2. The divergence in the C termini of ZO-1 like MAGUKs suggests that these proteins may have significant functional differences. Furthermore, ZOPs not only interact with occludin, claudins, and junctional adhesion molecule but also associate with a variety of cytoplasmic proteins of less defined function, including the myosin-binding protein cingulin (24Cordenonsi M. D'Atri F. Hammar E. Parry D.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Shore D. Citi S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1569-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), the Ras effector AF-6 (25Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and the erythrocyte actin-binding protein 4.1 (26Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.C. Hartenstein J.S. Benz E.J., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30573-30585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In recent years observations have accumulated indicating that ZO-2 localizes to the nucleus in epithelial cells (27Gonzales-Mariscal L. Islas S. Gonzales-Robles A. Ponce L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10S (abstr.): 2358Google Scholar, 28Islas S. Vega J. Ponce L. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Up to now, the biological relevance of this nuclear shuttling has remained elusive. We now report that nuclear ZO-2 interacts directly with the DNA-binding protein scaffold attachment factor-B (SAF-B) (29Renz A. Fackelmayer F.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This interaction has been identified and confirmed by use of a yeast-based two-hybrid screen and in vivo/in vitro co-immunoprecipitation studies. ZO-2 appeared to interact specifically with SAF-B but not with ZO-1. Using epitope-tagged ZO-2 fusion constructs, we have tested for the functional significance of the predicted nuclear localization and export signals (NLS and NES). Here we demonstrate that more than two NESs are active in driving the nuclear export of ZO-2. Also the previously proposed NLS does not seem to be the only targeting information domain responsible for the nuclear localization of ZO-2. We further show that EGFP/DsRed2-tagged fusion proteins of ZO-2 and SAF-B substantially co-localize in nuclei of MDCK cells and that increased nuclear staining of ZO-2 is observed in epithelial cells subjected to environmental stress conditions. pGBKT7–5′-ZO-2 was generated by subcloning the coding sequence of the N-terminal region of ZO-2 (aa 1- 470; GenBankTM accession number AF113005) into the yeast two-hybrid vector pGBKT7 (Clontech).pGBKT7-PDZ-1 encodes aa 18–99, and pGBKT7-PDZ-2encodes aa 301–369 of ZO-2 (GenBankTM accession numberL27152). pEGFP-SAF-B encodes aa 1–874, pEGFP-fSAF-B andpDsRed2-fSAF-B encode aa 425–826, andpGADT7-C-term. SAF-B encodes aa 445–826 of rat SAF-B (GenBankTM accession number AF056324). The following ZO-2 constructs (according to GenBankTMaccession number AAC37332 ) were generated: pEGFP-ZO-2 (aa 1–1174); pEGFP-5′-ZO-2 (aa 1–470);pEGFP-5′-ZO-2-ΔNES1 (aa 1–358);pEGFP-5′-ZO-2-ΔNES1ΔNLS1 (aa 95–358);pEGFP-ZO-2-mut (aa 1–1174; NES1 located at aa 361–369 mutated from LQLVVLRDS to LQVVVSRDS); and pEGFP-ZO-2–2xmut(aa 1–738; NES1 mutated as above, NES2 located at aa 728–738 mutated from LEKLANELPDL to LEKLANEFPDE). Monoclonal antibodies directed against c-Myc (Santa Cruz), GFP (Clontech), and β-tubulin (Sigma) were obtained from commercial sources. Polyclonal anti-ZO-2, anti-occludin, and anti-claudin-1 were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc., rabbit anti-integrin α3 antibody was obtained from Chemicon, and polyclonal anti-ubiquitin was from Santa Cruz. Antibodies directed against human SAF-B were kindly provided by Dr. Frank O. Fackelmayer (Heinrich Pette-Institute, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany). Monoclonal anti-SAF-B antibody was purchased from Abcam. Alexa FluorTM 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Molecular Probes. Preimmune serum was purchased from Pierce (ImmunoPure® normal rabbit serum). LLC-PK1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. MDCK cells were cultured in minimum essential medium enriched with 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection experiments the cells were grown to 70–80% confluence and transfected in suspension with EffecteneTM transfection reagent (Quiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. LLC-PK1 cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 5 min in 100% methanol at −20 °C. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and were permeabilized for 10 min in 0.25% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by three washing steps. After blocking for 30 min in 5% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature, the fixed cells were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-ZO-2 (diluted 1:100 in blocking solution) at 4 °C. After three washes the cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution; Alexa FluorTM 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG) for 1 h at 37 °C. After the final three washing steps the coverslips were mounted with Mowiol® 4–88 (Calbiochem). The images were taken using either a Zeiss AxioplanTM microscope equipped with the Zeiss AxioVision Imaging SystemTM or a laser confocal microscope (MRC 600; Bio-Rad). Two-Hybrid screening experiments were performed essentially as described (30Traweger A. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Stelzhammer W. Krizbai I.A. Fresser F. Bauer H.C. Bauer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10201-10208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain AH109 expressing the N-terminal region of ZO-2 (pGBKT7–5′-ZO-2) was transformed with a mouse liver MATCHMAKERTM cDNA library (Clontech). The transformants were then plated onto appropriate selective medium (SD/−Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp + 5 mm 3-aminotriazole). All of the positive clones were further processed as described and assayed for β-galactosidase activity by a colony lift filter assay as recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech). Further, the candidate clones were restreaked onto SD/−His/−Leu/−Trp + 100 mm3-aminotriazole to confirm the interaction. The nuclei were isolated according to the sucrose/citric acid method (31Oberleithner H. Brinckmann E. Schwab A. Krohne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9784-9788Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were harvested by trypsination and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. If the cells were treated with 60 μm CdCl2 or grown at 42 °C (for 2 h), the cell culture flasks were immediately transferred to ice, and the cells were harvested with a rubber policemen in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.2, 70 mm NaCl), and after an incubation on ice for 5 min, the cells were centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer B (10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.2, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were homogenized in a tight fitting glass/Teflon potter on ice (40 strokes at 800 rpm) followed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min (4 °C). The collected nuclei were resuspended in ice-cold solution of 0.88m sucrose, 1.5% citric acid and were given another five strokes at 800 rpm. The homogenate was carefully underlayered with ice-cold solution of 2.5 m sucrose, 1.5% citric acid and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min (4 °C). The layer containing the nuclei was carefully aspirated and washed with a large volume of CSC Buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). The isolated nuclei were centrifuged as indicated above and were either resuspended in SDS sample buffer or further processed for scanning electron microscopy according to standard procedures. Far Western analysis was performed as described previously (32Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins were extracted from MDCK cells by incubation in cell lysis buffer (20 mmTris·Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Pefabloc SC, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A) for 15 min on ice. Cell debris was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was split into four tubes. 2 μg of anti-ZO-1, anti-ZO-2, anti-occludin, or rabbit preimmune serum were added to the samples, and the immunoprecipitations were carried out as described below. The samples and BSA (50 μg/lane as negative control) were separated by SDS-PAGE and were transferred to PVDF membranes (Pall) by standard procedures. The membranes were blocked for 2 h in Blotto (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5% skimmed milk powder) at room temperature followed by an incubation in Hyb 75 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% skimmed milk powder) for 15 min at room temperature. 35S-Labeled SAF-B and lamin C were synthesized using the TNTTM T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). The probes were diluted in 3 ml of Hyb 75, and the membranes were incubated for 5 h at 4 °C. Finally, the membranes were washed three times in Hyb 75 for a total of 45 min, dried, and exposed to an x-ray film (Kodak). 35S-Labeled, c-Myc-tagged fragments of ZO-2 (PDZ-1 and PDZ-2) and SAF-B (C-term.SAF-B) were synthesized using the TNTTM T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Equal amounts of protein were combined and incubated at 30 °C for 1.5 h followed by the addition of 500 μl of co-immunoprecipitation buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 20 mmTris·Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm Pefabloc SC, 10% glycerol) and 2 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc. The samples were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 20 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). The immunocomplexes were then collected for 3 h at 4 °C and washed four times with 1 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis the gels were fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, soaked for 30 min in AmplifyTM (Amersham Biosciences), and dried under vacuum at 80 °C. The dried gels were then exposed to x-ray films (Kodak). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with pEGFP-fSAF-B and were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mmPipes, pH 6.1, 83 mm KCl, 17 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 5 mmNa3VO4, 0,5% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmPefabloc SC). After clearing the lysate by centrifugation (14,000 rpm; 15 min; 4 °C), co-immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as described by us earlier (30Traweger A. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Stelzhammer W. Krizbai I.A. Fresser F. Bauer H.C. Bauer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10201-10208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous SAF-B with endogenous ZO-2 proteins, 293E cells were incubated on ice for 2 h in X-link buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), 10 mm NaF, 5 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm Pefabloc SC). The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding 1 m Tris·Cl (pH 7.5) to 10 mm, Nonidet P-40 to 1%, and SDS to 0.05% final concentration, respectively. The cells were lysed on ice for 30 min, and the lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 12 min. The supernatant was split into three tubes, and 1.5 μg of anti-ZO-2 or anti-ubiquitin or no antibody was added to the samples followed by an incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were collected overnight (4 °C) by incubating the samples with 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (AmershamBiosciences). The beads were recovered by centrifugation at 1,600 × g for 30 s and were washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm Pefabloc SC). The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For quantitative Western blots, the protein content was determined using a BCATM-200 protein assay kit (Pierce). Of each sample 10 μg of protein were loaded and processed for immunoblotting as described earlier. Three independent experiments were performed, and three densitometric measurements/experiment were carried out using the Gel-Pro Analyzer 3.1 software from Media Cybernetics. We have observed previously that ZO-2 localizes to the nucleus of highly migratory endothelial cells (33Bauer H. Traweger A. Krizbai I.A. Stelzhammer W. Bauer H.C. Endothelium. 2001; 8 (abstr.): 294Google Scholar). To elaborate our earlier findings we have set out to identify novel interaction partners of ZO-2 that might elucidate the biological significance of its nuclear targeting. The results from our two-hybrid studies are shown in Fig. 1. We have used the N-terminal domain of ZO-2 (pGBKT7–5′-ZO-2), comprising PDZ-1 and PDZ-2, as a bait to screen a MATCHMAKERTM mouse liver cDNA expression library. One putative positive clone (AT1) was chosen and further tested by a β-galactosidase assay and by restreaking onto a SD/−His/−Leu/−Trp + 100 mm3-aminotriazole selection agar plate. As shown in Fig. 1 A, only AT1 (3Citi S. Cordenonsi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and the positive control (pGBKT7-p53/pGADT7-T) (1Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1631-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) showed 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining and were able to grow on the selection agar plate. The insert of AT1 was isolated, sequenced, and subjected to a BLAST2 sequence homology search. At the nucleotide and protein level, AT1 revealed the highest homology (95% identity) to SAF-B (GenBankTMaccession number AF056324). The isolated AT1 cDNA corresponds to nucleotides 1539–2747 (aa 425–826) of rat SAF-B (total length, 874 aa) and thus is referred to as fSAF-B below. To substantiate the interaction of SAF-B with ZO-2, in vivoco-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. LLC-PK1 cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-fSAF-B, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal α-ZO-2 antibody. For control studies immunoprecipitations were performed with preimmune serum or without antibody. The resulting blots were immunoprobed with α-GFP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the EGFP-tagged fSAF-B efficiently co-precipitated with endogenous ZO-2 (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), whereas no unspecific interactions were observed (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and3). Finally, endogenous SAF-B interacts with endogenous ZO-2 immunoprecipitated from 293 E cells (Fig. 1 C, lane 1). However, SAF-B only co-immunoprecipitated with ZO-2 efficiently if the cells were lysed in the presence of the chemical cross-linker DSP, suggesting that the association between ZO-2 and SAF-B is unstable in lysed cells. Nevertheless, a weak interaction was also observed in the absence of DSP (data not shown). The direct and specific association of endogenous ZO-2 with SAF-B was further evidenced by far Western blot analysis. MDCK cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitations were performed by the addition of antibodies against ZO-1, ZO-2, and occludin or preimmune serum (control). The resulting samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and hybridized with 35S-labeled in vitro translated SAF-B or lamin C (control). Fig. 1 D clearly demonstrates that SAF-B exclusively interacts with ZO-2 (lane 2), but neither with ZO-1 nor with occludin (lanes 1 and 3). Further, no unspecific binding was found with the unrelated probe lamin C (not shown). Next we determined which of the PDZ domains present in the original “bait” (5′-ZO-2) interacts with SAF-B. 35S-Labeled Myc-tagged fragments of ZO-2 comprising either PDZ-1 or PDZ-2 were synthesized in vitro and incubated with35S-labeled C-term.SAF-B. The samples were precipitated with a monoclonal α-c-Myc antibody, electrophoresed, and analyzed by fluorography. Fig. 1 E demonstrates that only PDZ-1 (lane 1) interacts with the C-terminal portion of SAF-B (C-term.SAF-B). Only slight unspecific binding was observed with PDZ-2 and lamin C (Fig. 1 E, lanes 2 and3). Using Western blot analysis we have further shown that ZO-2 is present in the nuclear fraction derived from MDCK cells (Fig. 2). As expected, the major portion of ZO-2 was found in total cell extracts, but a substantial amount was also detectable in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2 B). The purity of the nuclear pellet was monitored by electron microscopy (Fig. 2 A) and by marker protein staining (Fig. 2 B). SAF-B (nuclear marker) was exclusively present in the nuclear fraction, whereas β-tubulin (cytoplasmic marker) and integrin α3 (plasma membrane marker) were predominantly traceable in whole cell extracts (Fig. 2 B). Further, the electron micrograph showed that nuclear membranes were still intact after the nuclei isolation procedure (Fig. 2 A). We further demonstrate that nuclear ZO-2 is capable of interacting with35S-labeled SAF-B (Fig. 2 C, upper panel, arrowhead). For this experiment endogenous ZO-2 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts using an α-ZO-2 antibody. As a negative control, rabbit preimmune serum was used for immunoprecipitation. The samples were then electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridized with 35S-labeled SAF-B or probed with an α-ZO-2 AB. As a result, SAF-B specifically interacted with nuclear ZO-2 (Fig. 2 C, lane 1,arrowhead) but not with proteins precipitated by the preimmune serum (lane 2). No unspecific binding to BSA or to the PVDF membrane was observed (lanes 3 and 4). The lower panel of Fig. 2 C demonstrates the specific immunoprecipitation of ZO-2 from nuclear extracts (lane 5). No ZO-2 could be detected in the negative control using preimmune serum for immunoprecipitation (lane 6). The co-localization of SAF-B and ZO-2 in the nucleus of MDCK cells was monitored using EGFP/DsRed2-tagged proteins. Fig. 2 D shows considerable overlaps of the nuclear speckles corresponding to 5′-ZO-2-ΔNES1-EGFP and DsRed2-fSAF-B. Together, these results strongly support the suggestion that the interaction of ZO-2 with SAF-B takes place in the nucleus. It was suggested previously that ZO-2 contains two putative nuclear export signals (NES1 and NES2) and one prominent NLS (28Islas S. Vega J. Ponce L. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This is consistent with results from our sequence analyses using various prediction programs. To determine whether these leucine-rich motifs indeed are involved in the nuclear targeting of ZO-2, we have performed localization studies using EGFP-tagged ZO-2 mutants. Various ZO-2 constructs lacking one or more of the predicted domains were generated: (i) 5′-ZO-2, carrying NES 1 and the predicted NLS, (ii) 5′-ZO-2-ΔNES1, lacking NES 1 but carrying the NLS, (iii) 5′-ZO-2-ΔNES1Δ NLS, lacking both the NLS and NES1 motif, (iv) ZO-2 mut containing a mutation only in NES1, and (v)ZO-2 2xmut carrying mutations in both NES domains. Mutated proteins were expressed as EGFP fusion products in MDCK cells. Our results from transfection studies are shown in Fig. 3 B. Although5′-ZO-2 does not accumulate in the nucleus (Fig. 3 B, panel I), 5′-ZO-2ΔNES1 perfectly localizes to the nucleus (Fig. 3 B, panel II), suggesting that NES 1 is a functional domain and is sufficient to drive the nuclear export of the N-terminal portion of ZO-2. Deletion of the NLS motif (5′-ZO-2-ΔNES1Δ NLS) did not abolish the nuclear targeting of this ZO-2 mutant (Fig. 3 B, panel III), which indicates that one or more additional NLS domain(s) must be present in the N-terminal region of ZO-2. Interestingly, 5′-ZO-2-ΔNES1Δ NLS was uniformly distributed in the nucleus, and hardly any speckles were visible. This may be explained by the fact that this construct lacks the PDZ-1 domain and thus is not capable of interacting or co-localizing with SAF-B. The fusion proteinsZO-2 mut (Fig. 3 B, panel IV) andZO-2 2xmut (Fig. 3 B, panel V) were found to be exported from the nucleus, suggesting that yet unidentified NES domain(s) situated between NES1 and NES2 must be active in ZO-2. The nuclear presence of a junctional MAGUK was first demonstrated by Gottardi et al. (34Gottardi C.J. Arpin M. Fanning A.S. Louvard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10779-10784Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), showing that before cell maturation and during remodeling of cell-cell contacts, particular ZO-1 staining is visible in cultured MDCK cells. Complementing these results González-Mariscal et al. (27Gonzales-Mariscal L. Islas S. Gonzales-Robles A. Ponce L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10S (abstr.): 2358Google Scholar) and Islas et al. (28Islas S. Vega J. Ponce L. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) reported recently the localization of ZO-2 in the nucleus of subconfluent epithelial cell monolayers. Here we have shown that ZO-2 localizes to the nucleus of endothelial and epithelial cells although to varying extents (Fig. 4 A). Highly migratory endothelial cells exhibit considerable nuclear ZO-2 staining with a distinct speckled pattern (Fig. 4 A). In the nuclei of epithelial cells, ZO-2 immunoreactivity is low (not shown) but increases markedly in response to environmental stresses such as heat shock (Fig. 4, A and B) and chemical insult (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, ZO-2 staining is visible in the perinuclear area of all cell types inspected. Under physiological stress conditions, ZO-2 seems to be recruited to the nucleus, whereas cytoplasmic ZO-2 immunoreactivity diminishes and the localization of ZO-2 at plasma membranes appears unchanged. Fig. 4 Bdemonstrates the relocalization of nuclear and perinuclear ZO-2 in epithelial cells following chemical stress (CdCl2) and heat shock (42 °C). Quantitative Western blot experiments demonstrate that nuclear ZO-2 levels increase upon physiological stress conditions, especially in response to CdCl2 treatment (Fig. 4 C, right panel). The purity of the nuclear fraction was monitored as described above. Interestingly, the overall amount of ZO-2 protein is not significantly changed (Fig. 4 C, left panel). To test whether the nuclear accumulation of 5′-ZO-2, found to interact with SAF-B, influences other TJ-associated proteins, LLC-PK1 cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-5′-ZO-2-ΔNES1 and stained for occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1. As shown in Fig. 5, the localization of other TJ-related proteins appeared unchanged in cells overexpressing the nuclear ZO-2 fusion protein. Originally, SAF-B has been described as one of the abundant nuclear proteins that function in chromatin structure by interacting with scaffold or matrix attachment DNA elements (29Renz A. Fackelmayer F.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In many cases, these elements co-map with boundaries of actively transcribed domains and have therefore been considered to exert regulatory effects on adjacent genes. Although SAF-B does not exhibit any homology to other previously identified DNA-binding proteins, it nevertheless shares the ability for nucleic acid dependent self-aggregation with other scaffold or matrix attachment DNA-binding proteins such as histone H1 (35Izaurralde E. Kas E. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and topoisomerase II (36Adachi Y. Kas E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3997-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). SAF-B was shown to be highly concentrated in nuclear speckles co-localizing with SC-35 and to directly interact with various splicing factors and RNA polymerase II via its C-terminal domain (37Nayler O. Stratling W. Bourquin J.P. Stagljar I. Lindemann L. Jasper H. Hartmann A.M. Fackelmayer F.O. Ullrich A. Stamm S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that SAF-B is identical to the nuclear protein HAP (hnRNP A1-associated protein) (38Weighardt F. Cobianchi F. Cartegni L. Chiodi I. Villa A. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to HET (Hsp27-ERE-TATA-binding protein), which was found to exert a repressive action on the HSP27 promoter in human breast cancer cells (39Oesterreich S. Lee A.V. Sullivan T.M. Samuel S.K. Davie J.R. Fuqua S.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). During the last couple of years, intriguing evidence has accumulated suggesting that junctional MAGUKs not only serve as structural “organizers” at the plasma membrane linking the junctional plaque to the cytoskeleton but are also potentially involved in cell growth and transcriptional regulation. Convincing studies have been performed with Drosophila, showing that junctional proteins functioning in epithelial differentiation simultaneously act as tumor suppressors and are thus involved in growth control. As mentioned before, the N-terminal domain of ZOPs is homologous to theDrosophila tumor suppressor protein discs-large A (DlgA), a component of invertebrate septate junctions (40Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Dlg proteins with mutations in the PDZ and SH3 domains were found to cause neoplastic overgrowth of larval imaginal disc epithelial cells (17Woods D.F., Wu, J.W. Bryant P.J. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Comparably, another invertebrate orthologue of the mammalian ZOPs, theDrosophila tamou gene, has been implicated in regulating the expression of the tumor suppressor helix-loop-helix proteinextramacrochaetae, leading to the overgrowth of proneural cells in the fly (41Takahisa M. Togashi S. Suzuki T. Kobayashi M. Murayama A. Kondo K. Miyake T. Ueda R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1783-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mutants of ZO-1, which encode the PDZ domains but no longer localize at the plasma membrane, were shown to induce a fibroblastoid, transformed phenotype of MDCK cells in vitro, and an increased tumorigenicity of these cells in vivo (42Reichert M. Muller T. Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9492-9500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A detailed study concerning the expression of ZO-2 in normal and neoplastic human tissue has been reported by Chlenski et al.(43Chlenski A. Ketels K.V. Korovaitseva G.I. Talamonti M.S. Oyasu R. Scarpelli D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The authors have shown that ZO-2 was rarely abnormal in colon and prostate cancer but was de-regulated in most of the breast cancer samples. This indicates that activation or inactivation of ZO-2 expression may require participation of tissue-specific transcription factors. Last but not least, the recent report about the interaction of ZO-1 with the Y-box transcription factor ZONAB (ZO-1 associated nucleic acid binding protein) has further emphasized the notion of a potential “dual” role of ZOPs (44Balda M.S. Matter K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2024-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We report here that the tight junction-associated protein ZO-2 interacts directly with the DNA-binding protein SAF-B supposed to be involved in transcriptional regulation. Moreover, the results from ourin vivo co-immunoprecipitation studies strongly suggest that this interaction takes place in the nucleus. It will be interesting to identify possible alterations of gene expression elicited by ZO-2/SAF-B binding. This will further elucidate the role of junctional MAGUKs in a signaling cascade linking TJs to cell growth and proliferation. We thank A. Mänhardt and W. D. Krautgartner (Institute of Zoology, University of Salzburg) for preparing the scanning electron micrographs."

We identified here the domain157LIF159 of p21Cip1 as essential for the binding of SET.

These results indicate that SET might regulate G2/M transition by modulating cyclin B-CDK1 activity. cyclin-dependent kinase green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase amino acids SET was first identified as a gene that was fused to theCAN gene in a patient with acute undifferentiated leukemia, apparently as a result of a translocation (1von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). SET is a 39-kDa phosphoprotein widely expressed in human and mouse tissues and found predominantly in the cell nuclei, although it has been recently found associated to the endoplasmic reticulum (1von Lindern M. van Baal S.

SET belongs to a family of proteins that also includes nucleosome assembly protein 1, testis-specific protein Y-encoded, the suppressor of presenilin 2 protein, the brain protein MB20, the differentially expressed nucleolar transforming growth factor β1 target, and the cell division autoantigen 1 (5Wen C.

Not much is known about the role of SET in the regulation of cell activities, although several possible functions of this protein have been identified. SET has been found to be identical to the template-activating factor I, a host protein necessary for DNA replication of the adenovirus genome (9Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A long acidic domain in the C-terminal region of SET is essential for template-activating factor I activity (9Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). SET has been also identified as a potent inhibitor of the protein phosphatase 2A (10Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), a phosphatase involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression (11Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Moreover, SET has been shown to bind to nucleosomal histones and in that way protects histones from acetylation by a variety of histone acetyl transferases (11Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Because histone acetylation has been involved in the regulation of chromatin condensation and transcription (12Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), SET might be involved in the regulation of these processes (13Brown C.E. Lechner T. Howe L. Workman J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been described that SET binds to the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 inhibitor p21Cip1 in vivo and in vitro and that SET might revert the inhibition produced by p21Cip1 on cyclin E-CDK2 complexes but not on cyclin A-CDK2 (14Estanyol J.M.

SET also binds to p35 nck5a (15Qu D., Li, Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S., Li, R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), an activator of the neuronal CDK5 kinase functioning as a cyclin in neurons to support CDK5 activity (16Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness V.S.J. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). SET interacts specifically with B-type cyclins, although the functional significance of this interaction has not been elucidated (17Kellogg D.R. Kikuchi A. Fujii-Nakata T. Turck C.W. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In general, the known functions of SET clearly relate it with the control of cell cycle progression. However, the cell cycle functional steps regulated by SET still remain unclear. In the work reported here, we analyzed in detail the domains of p21Cip1 and SET involved in their association, and we have identified that SET might play a role in mitosis by regulating cyclin B-CDK1 activity. SET human cDNA in a pET plasmid was a gift from Dr. Damuni (Pennsylvania State University). The open reading frame of SET cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following specific primers: sense, 5′-gggggaattctaatgtcggcgcaggcggcc-3′, and antisense, 5′-ggggggaagcttagtcatcttctccttcat-3′. The PCR product was purified, digested by EcoRI and HindII, and cloned in-frame into pGEX-KG. cDNAs corresponding to different SET fragments (SET1, aa 1–80; SET2, aa 81–180; SET3, aa 181–277) were generated by PCR using the full-length SET cDNA as a template. The primers used to generate the different constructs were the following: SET1 sense, 5′-gggggaatctaatgtcggcgcaggcggcc-3′, and SET1 antisense, 5′-ggggaagcttatttgggattttggcgatca-3′; SET2 sense, 5′-ggggcatatgttttgggtaacaacatttgt-3′, and SET2 antisense, 5′-gggggggaagcttcctgctggctttattct-3′; SET3 sense, 5′-ggggcatatgaggcagcatgaggaaccaga-3′, and SET3 antisense, 5′-ggggggaagcttagtcatcttctccttcat-3′. After amplification, SET1 cDNA was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, whereas SET2 and SET3 were digested with NdeI andHindII. All fragments were cloned into pGEX-4T-2 vector. cDNA fragments of p21Cip1 (N terminus, aa 1–90; C terminus, aa 91–164) were obtained by PCR using specific primers and human p21Cip1 cDNA as a template. They were inserted into pGEX-4T-2 by BamHI-HindIII sites. The GFP and DsRed expression vectors were gifts from Dr. H. P. Rahn (Munich). All SET constructs were cloned intoBamHI-HindIII sites, and p21Cip1 was cloned into EcoRI-HindIII sites. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and subsequently purified by absorption to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (18Sanchez-Piris M. Posas F. Alemany V. Winge I. Hidalgo E. Bachs O. Aligue R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17722-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In several cases GST was separated from the GST fusion proteins by digestion with thrombin protease according to the manufacturer (Sigma). The colon carcinoma HCT116 cell line and the monkey COS-7 cell line were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biological Industries) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Both cell types were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transfections of COS and HCT166 cells were performed with Effectene (Qiagen) as directed by the manufacturer. Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and fresh medium was added after 12–18 h. Then cells were harvested at different times after transfection. To measure the effect of GFP-SET overexpression on CDK1 activity, transfected cultures were subjected to cell sorting to separate GFP- or GFP-SET-expressing cells. Cell sorting gave a 90% of purity. Then separated cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation and kinase assay as described below. Antibodies against cyclin A were from Santa Cruz (H-432). All the other antibodies, including anti-cyclin B1 (05–158), anti-cyclin E (06–459), anti-phospho histone H1 (06–597), and anti-phospho histone H3 (06–570), were from Upstate Biotechnology. Transfected cells were seeded in culture dishes containing glass coverslips and allowed to grow for at least 24 h. Cells were fixed with ethanol:acetic acid (95:5) and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times (5 min each) in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with cyanine 3 (Jackson) for 45 min at 37 °C. After washing, coverslips were mounted on slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem). Immunofluorescence was recorded using a confocal laser fluorescence microscope. To analyze the intracellular localization of DsRed-SET and GFP-p21Cip1, cells transfected with these plasmids were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, coverslips were mounted on slides with Mowiol, and immunofluorescence was recorded using a confocal laser fluorescence microscope. Cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 μg/μl aprotinin, 10 μg/μl leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4) for 30 min on ice. Lysates (0.1–0.5 mg of protein) were incubated with 2 μg of anti-cyclin B1 antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Then, protein G-agarose beads (Sigma) were added, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After 3 washes in buffer A and 2 in kinase buffer (50 mm Tri-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2), immunoprecipitates were resuspended in a final volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 4 μg of histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2 mmdithiothreitol. Then they were incubated with different amounts of recombinant SET or/and GST-p21Cip1 for 10 min. A kinase assay reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 μm ATP including 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (AmershamBiosciences). After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Histone H1 was separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were then stained with Coomassie Blue and dried. Phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. Pull-down experiments were performed as previously described (19Taules M. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Rius E. Estanyol J.M. Casanovas O. Sacks D.B. Perez-Paya E. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). SET protein, the different fragments of SET, and the different peptides and fragments of p21Cip1 were coupled to BrCN-activated Sepharose 4B, as indicated by the manufacturer. Then, samples (1–4 μg of protein) were incubated with 2 μg of immobilized protein or peptide in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100) for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were then extensively washed with binding buffer. The unbound fraction was the supernatant of the first wash. The bound fraction was extracted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer. Unbound and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Cell cycle analysis was studied by laser-scanning cytometry to determine the cellular DNA content in transfected cells. After transfection, cells were fixed with 70% methanol for 2 h at room temperature and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Then, they were incubated with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 200 μg/ml RNase for 10 min. The coverslips were seeded onto a slide using a mounting medium containing 25% propidium iodide (100 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) and 75% glycerol. Slides were scanned using the 20× objective and 5 mW of Argon laser power. A red fluorescence threshold and a minimum cell size of 100 pixels identified cells for measurement. At least 10,000 fluorescent-positive cells were analyzed. To analyze the binding of cyclin B to SET or to the mutated form SET1 + 2, 15 mg of Molt 4 extracts (lysed in buffer A) were loaded onto a SET-Sepharose 4B or SET1 + 2-Sepharose 4B columns (3 mg, each column). After washing in 50 volumes of the same buffer, proteins bound to the column were eluted with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The eluted proteins were subjected to Western blotting using anti-cyclin B1 antibodies. We previously reported that SET binds to a peptide of p21Cip1 containing aa 145–164 (14Estanyol J.M. Jaumot M. Casanovas O. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Agell N. Bachs O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33161-33165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the binding analysis performed in this previous study did not cover all the p21Cip1 sequence. To define more precisely the SET binding domains of p21Cip1, this protein was fractionated in two parts we named NT domain (aa 1–90) and CT domain (aa 91–164). Then, the binding of SET to these fragments was analyzed by pull-down experiments. Results showed that SET only bound to the CT domain of p21Cip1 (data not shown). We subsequently analyzed the binding of SET to four synthetic peptides from this CT domain of p21Cip1, 1 (aa 84–98), 2 (aa 99–121), 3 (aa 122–139), and 4 (aa 140–164). Peptides were coupled to Sepharose 4B and pull down experiments were performed. Results showed that SET only significantly bound to peptide 4 (Fig. 1 A). These results together with those previously reported (14Estanyol J.M. Jaumot M. Casanovas O. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Agell N. Bachs O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33161-33165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) indicate that the p21Cip1 region, including aa 140–164, contains the SET binding domain of p21Cip1. To analyze in detail the putative SET-binding sites in this p21Cip1 region, we studied the binding of SET to 4 overlapping peptides from this domain named 4A (aa 140–150), 4B (aa 145–155), 4C (aa 150–160), and 4D (aa 155–164). Pull-down experiments showed that SET bound to peptides 4A, 4C, and 4D but not to 4B (Fig. 1 B), indicating that p21Cip1 binds to SET by two separated domains (aa 140–144 and aa 156–160). To further confirm the relevance of the region including aa 155–160 in the binding to SET, we generated mutated p21Cip1 fragments by changing aa 157 (Leu) and aa 159 (Phe) to Asp. Specifically, we generated the mutated peptides 4C-DID (aa 150–160 with the mutations), 4-DID (aa 140–164 with the mutations), and also the fragment CT-DID (aa 84–164 with the mutations). The binding analysis clearly indicated that all these fragments containing the mutation did not associate with SET (Fig. 2). Thus, the157LIF159 domain of the C terminus of p21Cip1 is essential for the SET-p21Cip1interaction.Figure 2Change of the p21Cip1157LIF159 domain by157DID159 inhibits the binding of SET.p21Cip1-mutated fragments were generated by changing aa 157 (Leu) and aa 159 (Phe) to Asp. Peptides 4C-DID, 4-DID, and fragment CT-DID (all of them containing the mutations) were coupled to Sepharose 4B beads. The amount of SET bound (B) or not bound (NB) to p21–4C- DID (A) or p21–4-DID (B) beads was analyzed by gel electrophoresis.C, the binding of p21CT or p21CT-DID to SET-Sepharose beads was analyzed by gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the SET domains that interact with p21Cip1, we generated three SET fragments, SET1 (aa 1–80), SET2 (aa 81–180), and SET3 (aa 181–277) (Fig. 3 A). Then the binding of these three fragments of SET to p21Cip1 peptides 1–4 coupled to Sepharose 4B was analyzed by pull-down experiments. Results showed that SET2 and SET3 but not SET1 associated with p21Cip1 peptide 4 (Fig. 3 B). Neither SET2 nor SET3 bound to the mutated peptide 4-DID (Fig. 3 B). Then, the binding of SET fragments to p21Cip1 peptides 4A (aa 140–150), 4B (aa 145–155), 4C (aa 150–160), and 4D (aa 155–164) was studied. Results indicated that fragments SET2 and SET3 bound to peptides 4C and 4D, although SET3 in addition bound also to peptide 4A (Fig. 3 C). These results revealed that p21Cip1 putative binding sites are present in SET2 and SET3 fragments. The binding site from SET2 only binds to aa 156–160 of p21Cip1, whereas the binding site(s) in SET3 might associate with aa 140–144 and/or aa 156–160 of p21Cip1. COS cells were transfected with GFP-p21Cip1 constructs alone or together with DsRed-SET, and the cellular localization of both proteins was subsequently analyzed by confocal microscopy. In some cells a clear co-localization between both proteins was observed (Fig. 4 A). In many cases a clear co-localization was observed in perinucleolar areas (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, in other cells p21Cip1 and SET were separated (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicate a temporal better than a constitutive association of SET with p21Cip1 in the cells. Immunocytochemical studies to detect endogenous proteins using anti-SET and anti- p21Cip1antibodies also showed the co-localization of both proteins in a significant number of cells (Fig. 4 D). Whether this temporal association is related to specific phases of the cell cycle is under study in our laboratory. To analyze the possible role of SET in cell cycle regulation we studied the effect of SET overexpression on cell cycle progression. By using laser-scanning confocal analysis, we determined the amount of DNA in COS and HCT116 cells transfected with GFP-SET or GFP. As shown in Fig. 5, SET overexpression induced a clear increase in the number of cells at G2/M and a decrease in the number of cells in G1 in both cell types. These results suggest that overexpression of SET blocks cell cycle at G2/M. To further confirm this possibility, experiments analyzing the effect of SET overexpression on histone H3 phosphorylation (this phosphorylation only occurs in mitotic cells) were performed on COS and HCT116 cells. Results revealed that in both cell types transfected with SET, no phosphorylated histone H3 was observed (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, cells transfected only with GFP showed this phosphorylation (Fig. 6, A and B). Overexpression of SET did not block the cell cycle at S phase since transfected cells showed bromodeoxyuridine incorporation (data not shown). These results support the hypothesis that SET might be involved in the regulation of G2/M transition.Figure 6Effect of SET overexpression on phosphorylation of histones H3 and H1. HCT116 (A andC) and COS (B and D) cells were transfected with GFP-SET or GFP as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Then cells were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis using specific antibodies against phosphorylated H3 (A andB) or H1 (C and D) histones.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Evidence presented here showing that overexpression of SET blocked cell cycle progression at G2/M and the fact that SET binds to cyclin B (17Kellogg D.R. Kikuchi A. Fujii-Nakata T. Turck C.W. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) suggests that SET alone or together with p21Cip1 might be involved in the regulation of cyclin B-CDK1 activity. Thus, we first studied the effect of SET overexpression on histone H1 phosphorylation (histone H1 phosphorylation depends on cyclin B-CDK1 activity). These experiments were performed on COS and HCT116 cells transfected with GFP-SET or GFP as a control. Results revealed that cells overexpressing SET did not show H1 phosphorylation, whereas those transfected only with GFP did (Fig. 6, C and D). We subsequently studied the effect of SET overexpression on cyclin B-CDK1 activity. At 48 h after transfection with GFP-SET or GFP alone, COS and HCT116 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-cyclin B antibodies. Then immunoprecipitates were analyzed for CDK1 activity. Results indicated that after SET transfection cyclin B-CDK1 activity was clearly inhibited in both cell types (Fig. 7 A). To analyze whether SET might directly regulate cyclin B-CDK1 activity, HCT116 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with specific anti-cyclin B antibodies. Then CDK1 activity was determined in the immunoprecipitates in the presence or absence of exogenous SET. As shown in Fig. 7 B, CDK1 activity was inhibited by the addition of 1–2 μmpurified SET. Inhibition was dose-dependent, and the effect was similar to that observed by recombinant GST-p21Cip1(Fig. 7 B). Interestingly, this effect was specific for cyclin B-CDK1 because cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin E-CDK2 activities were not affected by the addition of purified SET (Fig. 8 A). SET and p21Cip1 generate an additive inhibitory effect. The addition of 0.5 μm SET and 0.5 μmp21Cip1 inhibited cyclin B-CDK1 activity, whereas at these doses SET and p21Cip1 added alone only produced a limited inhibition (Fig. 8 B). To determine which domain of SET was involved in the inhibition of cyclin B-CDK1 activity, we studied the effect of SET fragments (SET1, SET2, and SET3) on this activity. Results indicate that SET3 fragment contains the cyclin B-CDK1 inhibitory domain (Fig. 8 C). To further confirm this possibility, we analyzed the binding of cyclin B to a mutated form of SET lacking the SET3 fragment (SET1 + 2). Affinity columns of SET or SET1 + 2 were prepared and loaded with cell extracts. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted, and the presence of cyclin B in the eluates was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 9 A, cyclin B bound to SET but not to SET1 + 2, indicating that SET3 was responsible for cyclin B binding. Overexpression of SET1 + 2 in COS cells showed an intracellular localization both nuclear and cytoplasmic, similar to the distribution of GFP but different to SET-GFP that was mainly nuclear (Fig. 9 B). The overexpression of this mutated form of SET was not able to block cell cycle at G2/M (Fig. 9 C). These results support the SET3 domain as responsible for the regulation of G2/M transition.Figure 8SET specifically inhibits cyclin B-CDK1 activity, and its effect is additive to that of p21Cip1. A, HCT116 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against cyclins B, A, or E. Then CDK activities associated with these cyclins were determined in the immunoprecipitates (IP) in the absence (C+) or in the presence of different concentrations of exogenous SET. B, cyclin B-CDK1 activity was determined in immunoprecipitates from HCT116 cell extracts in the absence (C+) or in the presence of 0.5 μm SET or p21Cip1 alone or in combination.C, cyclin B-CDK1 activity was determined in immunoprecipitates from HCT116 cell extracts in the absence (C+) or in the presence of 2 μm concentrations of the different SET fragments (SET1, SET2, and SET3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Overexpression of a mutant form of SET, lacking aa 181–277, did not block cell cycle progression.

We report here that SET inhibits cyclin B-CDK1 activity both in vivo and in vitro and that this inhibitory capacity is additive to that of p21Cip1. Thus, SET might be involved in the regulation of G2/M transition. Our results revealed that SET binds to two specific domains of p21Cip1 located at the C terminus (aa 140–144 and aa 156–164). The later domain is essential for the binding of SET to p21Cip1 since specific mutations in this region block the association between both proteins. Thus, domain 140–144 might help the binding, but it is not enough for maintaining a stable association with SET when domain 156–164 is mutated. The C terminus of p21Cip1, which includes the 156–164 domain, also binds a number of proteins including proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the E7 oncoprotein of the human papilloma virus, Gadd45, c-Myc, and calmodulin among others (19Taules M.

Studies to analyze the ability of SET to compete with these other p21Cip1-binding proteins for the association with p21Cip1 are still lacking. Thus, the possible involvement of SET on the modulation of the binding of p21Cip1 to these important cell cycle regulators is still unknown. SET binds to p21Cip1 also by two domains, one located at the central region of SET, whereas the other one is placed at the C-terminal region. These results suggest that SET might associate with two p21Cip1 molecules at the same time or, alternatively, that the two SET-binding sites of p21Cip1 (aa 140–145 and 156–164) might bind to two different domains of SET. Experimental work to answer this question is under way in our laboratory. A previous report demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments that SET and p21Cip1 might be associated in vivo(14Estanyol J.M. Jaumot M. Casanovas O. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Agell N. Bachs O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33161-33165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate the in vivo co-localization of both proteins by ectopically expressing p21Cip1 and SET followed by confocal microscopy analysis but also by immunofluorescence studies using specific antibodies. Results reported here indicate that p21Cip1 and SET clearly co-localize in the nucleus; however, patterns showing that both proteins might also be separated inside the nucleus were also observed in a significant number of cells. These results suggest that both proteins might interact at specific moments of the cell cycle but not in others. A possibility is that both proteins might interact during mid-late S phase. The perinucleolar pattern of co-localization (Fig. 4 A) suggests that both proteins might interact during the mid-S phase since a perinucleolar pattern of replication factories has been observed at this stage of S phase (24Leonhardt H. Rahn H.P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In addition, preliminary results obtained in our laboratory indicate that SET co-localizes with bromodeoxyuridine in the replication factories. Studies to define the kinetics of p21Cip1-SET interactions during cell cycle are under way in our laboratory. Overexpression of SET in two different cellular types, COS and HCT116, induced the inhibition of cell cycle progression at G2/M transition. This block is associated with the inhibition of cyclin B-CDK1 activity, indicating that SET might be involved in the control of mitosis entry by regulating the activity of cyclin B-CDK1 complexes. Results from in vitro experiments revealing that SET inhibits cyclin B-CDK1 activity at concentrations similar to those of p21Cip1 strongly support this hypothesis. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of SET and p21Cip1 are additive, suggesting that they might cooperate in regulating cyclin B-CDK1 activity under specific circumstances, as for instance after DNA damage. This cooperation in the inhibition of cyclin B-CDK1 might be similar to that occurring between Gadd45 and p21Cip1 after DNA damage (25Chen I.T. Smith M.L. O'Connor P.M. Fornace A.J.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1931-1937PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). The specific domain of SET involved in cyclin B-CDK1 inhibition is located at the C-terminal region (SET3) that contains a long very acidic domain (aa 225–277). Recently, it has been shown that Gadd45 binds to CDK1 and inhibits the activity of cyclin B-CDK1 complexes (27Zhan Q. Antinore M.J. Wang X.W. Carrier F. Smith M.L. Harris C.C. Fornace A.J.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36892-36898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Gadd45 domain responsible for the inhibition is an acidic patch including the sequence DEDDDR (28Yang Q. Manicone A. Coursen J.D. Linke S.P. Nagashima M. Forgues M. Wang X.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36892-36898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ran, a small nuclear GTPase implicated in both cell cycle progression and nuclear export (29Ren M. Coutavas E. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4216-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32834-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), also contains an acidic motif with similar amino acid composition in its C-terminal domain (DEDDDL) (31Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It has been shown that overexpression of Ran induces G2/M arrest, whereas deletion of the DEDDDL motif abolishes this activity (29Ren M. Coutavas E. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4216-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C-terminal region of SET contains an acidic sequence 260DEDDDE265 that is very similar to those of Gadd45 and Ran, involved in the regulation of cyclin B-CDK1 activity and G2/M transition. All these results suggest that this sequence included in the C terminus of SET is the one involved in the inhibition of cyclin B-CDK1 activity and, consequently, in G2/M block. However, this still remains to be proved. Results reported here together with recent reports indicate that SET has a relevant role in the regulation of CDK activities. A previous report revealed that SET blocks the inhibitory effect of p21Cip1 on cyclin E-CDK2, thus allowing a cyclin E-CDK2 activity in the presence of p21Cip1 (14Estanyol J.M. Jaumot M. Casanovas O. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Agell N. Bachs O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33161-33165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this case, SET plays a role as an “activator” of these complexes in G1. Recently, it has been shown that SET binds to p35 nck5a and p35 nck5ai (15Qu D., Li, Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S., Li, R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both proteins are activators of the neuronal CDK5 (16Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness V.S.J. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). SET and p35 nck5a co-localize in the nucleus of cultured cortical neurons, and in vitro experiments indicated that SET enhanced the activity of p35 nck5a -CDK5. Interestingly, the acidic tail of SET is required for the stimulatory effect of p35 nck5a -CDK5 (15Qu D., Li, Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S., Li, R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Results reported here indicate that in addition to the positive regulation of CDK2 and CDK5 activities, SET might also play a role as a negative regulator of CDK1. This information reveals that SET plays a dual role in the cell cycle as a positive regulator of G1/S and as a negative regulator of mitosis entry. A possibility that has to be investigated is that SET might be involved in blocking cyclin B-CDK1 during S phase and G2, avoiding a premature activation of these complexes before cells would be ready to enter mitosis. SET is also a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, which is involved in different cellular functions, including cell proliferation (10Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This fact suggest a concerted regulation by SET of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of nuclear proteins during cell proliferation but also during other cellular processes requiring the activity of CDKs. Results of this study are the first to demonstrate that SET is a negative regulator of cyclin B-CDK1 in vivo and in vitro and as a consequence of mitosis entry. The fact that SET is also involved in the regulation of chromatin structure by modulating histone acetylation (11Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) places this protein in a key position in the regulation of cell cycle. On the one hand, SET might be involved in the control the phosphorylation status of nuclear proteins by regulating CDK and protein phosphatase 2A activities. On the other hand, SET might control transcriptional activity of chromatin by regulating histone acetylation and chromatin condensation. The protein p21Cip1might participate in these processes, although its role still remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2002811618,"Signal transduction in neurons is a dynamic process, generally thought to be driven by transient changes in the concentration of second messengers. Here we describe a novel regulatory mechanism in which the dynamics of signaling through cyclic AMP are mediated by activity-dependent changes in the affinity of the hyperpolarization-activated, cation nonselective (HCN) channels for cAMP, rather than by changes in cAMP concentration. Due to the allosteric coupling of channel opening and ligand binding, changes in cellular electrical activity that alter the opening of the HCN channels modify the binding of static, basal levels of cAMP. These changes in ligand binding produce long-lasting changes in channel function which can contribute to the regulation of rhythmic firing patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2116560077,"Experience is a powerful sculptor of developing neural connections. In the primary visual cortex (V1), cortical connections are particularly susceptible to the effects of sensory manipulation during a postnatal critical period. At the molecular level, this activity-dependent plasticity requires the transformation of synaptic depolarization into changes in synaptic weight. The molecule alpha calcium-calmodulin kinase type II (alphaCaMKII) is known to play a central role in this transformation. Importantly, alphaCaMKII function is modulated by autophosphorylation, which promotes Ca(2+)-independent kinase activity. Here we show that mice possessing a mutant form of alphaCaMKII that is unable to autophosphorylate show impairments in ocular dominance plasticity. These results confirm the importance of alphaCaMKII in visual cortical plasticity and suggest that synaptic changes induced by monocular deprivation are stored specifically in glutamatergic synapses made onto excitatory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2090061589,"Immobilized and diffusible molecular cues regulate axon guidance during development. GFRalpha1, a GPI-anchored receptor for GDNF, is expressed as both membrane bound and secreted forms by accessory nerve cells and peripheral targets of developing sensory and sympathetic neurons during the period of target innervation. A relative deficit of GFRalpha1 in developing axons allows exogenous GFRalpha1 to capture GDNF and present it for recognition by axonal c-Ret receptors. Exogenous GFRalpha1 potentiates neurite outgrowth and acts as a long-range directional cue by creating positional information for c-Ret-expressing axons in the presence of a uniform concentration of GDNF. Soluble GFRalpha1 prolongs GDNF-mediated activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), an event required for GFRalpha1-induced neurite outgrowth and axon guidance. Together with GDNF, target-derived GFRalpha1 can function in a non-cell-autonomous fashion as a chemoattractant cue with outgrowth promoting activity for peripheral neurons."

All share a highly homologous primary sequence, 40–60% homology at the amino acid level, to each other particularly in the predicted catalytic domain. Each member exhibits different substrate specificity toward peptide sequences. Thus, the positions of O-glycan in proteins are determined by the substrate specificity of each pp-GalNAc-T. The genes encoding these enzymes are distributed at different genomic localizations on chromosomes and have distinct genomic structures (4Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Mandel U. Mirgorodskaya E.

Many pp-GalNAc-Ts, including pp-GalNAc-T1, were found to be distributed in digestive organs, lymphatic organs, and peripheral blood cells (3Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol.

Tenno M. Konishi M. Mikami T. Itoh N. Kurosaka A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Very recently, it was reported that certain proteins in neurons, such as a neurite outgrowth receptor, human α-synuclein related to Parkinson's disease, and human syndecan-3, are modified by O-linked glycosylation (23Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 24Akita K. Fushiki S. Fujimoto T. Munesue S. Inoue M. Oguri K. Okayama M. Yamashina I. Nakada H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is of interest to identify the pp-GalNAc-T(s) responsible for the O-linked glycosylation of proteins in neurons. The shortest sequence motif, XTPXP, required for high level mucin-type O-glycosylation, was discovered using semi-purified pp-GalNAc-T from bovine colostrum (25Yoshida A. Suzuki M. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16884-16888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, it has not been determined whether this motif is suitable for all pp-GalNAc-Ts, some of which were not cloned until the motif was found. Thus, it is now important to determine the peptide motif specifically recognized by each pp-GalNAc-T. pp-GalNAc-T13 has a very high level of sequence identity topp-GalNAc-T1. This resulted previously in the establishment of mice lacking an intact gene for pp-GalNAc-T13 by using the pp-GalNAc-T1 gene as a probe for cloning, and prior to evidence for multiple pp-GalNAc-T isozymes (26Hennet T. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12070-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 27Marth J.D. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the previous study (27Marth J.D. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the complete gene encoding pp-GalNAc-T13, which was partially identified and tentatively designated mousepp-GalNAc-T8, was never cloned and characterized. In this report, we cloned and characterized a pp-GalNAc-T13 that is expressed exclusively in neuronal cells. We examined the substrate specificities of both enzymes, pp-GalNAc-T13 and -T1, toward peptides encoded in the sequences of O-glycosylated proteins in digestive organs and neuronal cells. The tumor cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cell lines were donated or else purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection, Riken Cell Bank, Japan Cell Research Bank, Immunobiological Laboratory, or Dai-Nippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. In the data base of the full-length human cDNA sequencing project supported by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, we found a cDNA encoding a full-length sequence of pp-GalNAc-T13, which is highly homologous to human pp-GalNAc-T1 (2White T. Bennett E.P. Takio K. Sorensen T. Bonding N. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24156-24165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the full-length human cDNA sequence project, an oligo-capped, full-length enriched cDNA library of human NT2RI cells was constructed using an expression vector pME18SFL3 according to the oligo-capping method (28Ohashi H. Maruyama K. Liu Y.C. Yoshimura A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This novel sequence (2428 bp) ofpp-GalNAc-T13 encoded a full open reading frame from bp 527 to 2198. The full-length sequence of pp-GalNAc-T13 was deposited into GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank with the accession number AB078142. In a mouse EST data base, we found four EST sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers BF467081, BE859530, BB623792, and BB304998) being highly homologous (92.5% homology at the nucleic acid level and 99.3% at the amino acid sequence level) to human pp-GalNAc-T13. In this study, the full-length sequence of mousepp-GalNAc-T13 was registered in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank with the accession numberAB082928. The method used to express the soluble form of the enzyme was almost the same as that described in our previous paper (29Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H. Kudo T. Togayachi A. Ishizuka Y. Nakanishi H. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12802-12809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Truncated coding regions of pp-GalNAc-T13 and -T1, starting at the same amino acid, residue 40, were constructed downstream of the human immunoglobulin κ secretion signal and the FLAG epitope tag in the vector pFBIF. An expression construct ofpp-GalNAc-T13 was prepared by PCR using primer RO17F (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCAGATCTCTGCTGCCTGCATTGAGG-3′) and O17R (5′- GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTATGTGCCCAAGGTCATGTTCCTTAG-3′). The amplified fragment was cloned into pFBIF, and the construct was used to produce recombinant virus, which was in turn used to infect Sf21 (Pharmingen) or High FiveTM insect cells (Invitrogen) and amplified. The infected Sf21 or High FiveTM insect cells were incubated at 27 °C until the survival rate of the cells was less than 30–50% to yield conditioned media containing recombinant pp-GalNAc-T13 protein fused with the FLAG peptide. The recombinant protein was readily purified using anti-FLAG M1 antibody resin (Sigma) and eluted with a 50 mmTris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) buffer containing 2 mm EDTA. The FLAG-tagged protein purified from the mock-transfected cells did not show any activity (data not shown). To compare the activity of pp-GalNAc-T13 to those of human pp-GalNAc-T1 and -T9, recombinant forms of the latter two were also prepared. For pp-GalNAc-T1, the sequence was cloned into pFBIF by PCR with the primer RT1F120 (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCAGAGGACTTCCTGCTGGAGATGTT-3′) and OT1R (5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTAGAATATTTCTGGCAGGGTGACGTT-3′) and then expressed in the High Five insect cells. A soluble form of human pp-GalNAc-T9 was produced in the same way. The primers used to clone pp-GalNAc-T9 were RT9F115 (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCCGCATCGTGAGCGGCGACCGCCGGT-3′) and OT9R (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAAGGAGATAGAACCATGGCGGTGGCCAGGAAGATCCGA-3′). Recombinant pp-GalNAc-T13, -T1, and -T9 proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad). Bands of interest were detected using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody with Western blotting to determine the relative amounts of recombinant enzymes. The acceptor peptides Muc1a′ (AHGVTSAPDTR), Muc5AC (GTTPSPVPTTSTTSA), and Muc7 (PTPSATTPAPPSSSAPPETTAA) were derived from the tandem repeat of human MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC7, respectively (30Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Lalani E.N. Wilson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15286-15293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gum J.R.

Biochem. 2001; 82: 246-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (their sequences are shown in Table I). We purchased commercially synthesized peptides with the N-terminal or C-terminal amino acid labeled with 5-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (5-FAM, SE) (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Muc1a′, Muc5Ac, SDC222, and SDC238 peptides were labeled with 5-FAM at their N-terminal amino acid.

The enzyme reaction was performed for an appropriate period at 37 °C and terminated by boiling. The reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) using a Cosmosil 5C18-AR reverse phase column (4.6 × 250 mm) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a linear gradient of 0–50% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 30 min at 40 °C. FAM-labeled glycopeptides were detected by fluorescence detector (RF-10AXL, Shimadzu) at an emission wavelength of 520 nm. K m values for acceptor substrates were calculated using peptides with concentrations from 0.01 to 2 mm in the presence of 0.5–1.0 mmUDP-GalNAc. The Michaelis-Menten equation was applied to the initial rate data using a non-linear least square regression program (34Kubota T. Yoshikawa S. Matsubara H. J. Biochem.

For the quantification of pp-GalNAc-T13 and -T1transcripts, we employed the real time PCR method, as described in detail previously (29Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H.

Marathon ReadyTM cDNAs derived from various human tissues were purchased from Clontech. cDNAs derived from many different cells were prepared as in our previous study (37Togayachi A. Akashima T.

Standard curves for the pp-GalNAc-T13 and -T1 genes and the endogenous control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), were generated by the serial dilution of pBluescript II SK(+) vectors containing the pp-GalNAc-T13 and-T1 genes and a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) containing the GAPDH cDNA, respectively. The PCR mixture was prepared using a TaqMan Universal Master Mix (PE Applied Biosystems). Primer sets and probes were as follows: for pp-GalNAc-T13 gene, a forward primer (T13-F) encoded in exon 6–7, 5′-ATCTTGAAATGTCTTTTAGGATTTGGC-3′; a reverse primer (T13-R) encoded in exon 8–9, 5′-TGGTTTCAACATTTCTTATCTCACCA-3′; and a probe (T13-P) in exon 7, 5′-CCTGGTGGCACTGGTCATGTCATCAACAAG-3′ with a minor groove binder (38Kutyavin I.V.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar); for pp-GalNAc-T1 gene (GenBankTM accession number X85018), a forward primer (T1-F) in exon 1–2, 5′-GGACTTCCTGCTGGAGATGTTCTA-3′; a reverse primer (T1-R) in exon 3–4, 5′-CTAAAGGCCTTTTCAAAAAGTCTCTTTC-3′; and a probe (T1-P) in exon 3, 5′-CAATGAGGCTTGGAGCACACTTCTG CG-3′ with the minor groove binder. Each real time PCR was performed for 50 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) using a real time PCR system (ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System, Applied Biosystems). cDNAs derived from primary cultured neurons and astrocytes from mouse were prepared as follows: E17 and P0 wild-type mouse brain was used for the primary culture of neurons and astrocytes, respectively, according to the method described previously (39Nagata K. Takei N. Nakajima K. Saito H. Kohsaka S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For the neuron culture, the cells were seeded to the poly-l-lysine-coated wells of 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% FBS. The neurons were cultured for 5 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For the astrocyte culture, the cells were seeded to 75-cm2 flasks at a density of 2.0 × 107 cells/bottle in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% FBS and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with a change of medium twice a week. After 1 week, non-astrocytes were removed by shaking (40McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3378) Google Scholar). The resultant astrocytic monolayer was removed and dissociated by trypsin treatment. The cell suspension was seeded onto 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 105/well or onto 75-cm2 culture flasks at a density of 2 × 107 cells. The astrocytes were cultured for a further 5 days. The purity of the neurons and the astrocytes in each primary culture was ∼97 and over 98%, respectively, as determined by immunostaining with anti-neurofilament antibody (Dako, A/S, Denmark) for neurons and with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (Dako) for astrocytes. We designed primer sets for the measurement of the transcripts for mouse pp-GalNAc-T13, -T1, andβ-actin genes by RT-PCR. Primer sets were as follows: for mouse pp-GalNAc-T13, a forward primer (mT13-F), 5′-ATCCCTGCTGCCTGCGCTGAGG-3′, and a reverse primer (mT13-R), 5′-TGTCCCCAAGGTCATGTTCCTCAG-3′; for mouse pp-GalNAc-T1, a forward primer (mT1-F), 5′- ATGAGAAAATTTGCATATTGCAAG-3′, and a reverse primer (mT1-R), 5′-TCAGAATATTTCTGGAAGGGTGACATT-3′; for mouse β-actin, a forward primer, 5′-ATATCGCTGCGCTGGTCGTCGAC-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-CAAGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAG-3′. In order to determine the glycosylation sites of products of the pp-GalNAc-T13 and -T1 reactions, glycopeptides isolated by HPLC were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS using REFLEXTM IV (Bruker Daltonics, Tsukuba, Japan) and Edman degradation on a protein sequencer PPSQ-23A (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mass spectra were externally calibrated unless otherwise stated. The glycopeptides to be examined were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to a concentration of 2 pmol/μl. One microliter of the sample solution was mixed with 1 μl of the matrix solution (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 10 mg/ml in 30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and then applied directly to the target. Simultaneously, 50–100 pmol of the same sample was dried on PVDF membrane with Prosorb Sample Preparation Cartridge (Applied Biosystems) and spotted on BioBrene Plus (Applied Biosystems). Phenylhydantoin (PTH)-amino acid mixed standard (Wako, Osaka, Japan) was chromatographed using the isocratic program and monitored for absorbance at 269 nm. The PTH-Thr-O-GalNAc diastereomers were detected in two peaks at 3.07 and 3.25 min, which were near the position of dithiothreitol. The PTH derivative of Ser-O-GalNAc (Calbiochem) was identified as a peak at 2.96 min the same as the retention time of PTH-Glu. Brain tissues from pp-GalNAc-T13 null-mice and wild-type mice described in a previous study (26Hennet T. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Paraffin sections were prepared with a 5-μm thickness, then deparaffinized, and rehydrated. After the blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, the serial tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with HB-Tn1 (1:50) antibody (Dako). After being rinsed with Tris-buffered saline, the tissue sections were incubated with Envision+ (Dako) for 30 min at room temperature. After another rinse, the peroxidase activity was visualized with the aid of a diaminobenzidine/hydrogen peroxide solution. Counterstaining was carried out with hematoxylin. Anti-mouse IgM (Dako) was used for control experiments; no specific staining was found (data not shown). Glycopeptides, including mono-GalNAc/T-SDC106, di-GalNAcs/TT-SDC106, and tri-GalNAcs/STT-SDC, were produced by pp-GalNAc-T13 with FAM-SDC106 as an acceptor substrate. Mono-GalNAc-Muc1a′ was prepared with pp-GalNAc-T6. Approximately 100 pmol of naked peptides (FAM-Muc1a′ and FAM-SDC106) and glycosylated peptides were dissolved in 50% 2-propanol and dot-blotted on the PVDF membrane (Atto, Tokyo, Japan). After peptide thermal blotting using the TCL Thermal Blotter (Atto) at 180 °C, 0.08 kg/cm2 for 30 s, the membrane was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight and subjected to Western blotting analysis. The primary antibody, HB-Tn1 (Dako), and a secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse-IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Pennsylvania), was diluted 1:100- and 2500-fold in phosphate-buffered saline, respectively.

One major drawback to this otherwise exciting story is the requirement for islets derived from two to four cadaver donors to treat a single patient with diabetes. Thus, an enormous shortage of human islets is a barrier to the use of islet transplantation on a larger scale. To solve this problem, one potential approach is the use of factors that can increase beta cell proliferation and/or function and/or protect against beta cell death. Several groups have identified factors that can induce pancreatic islet cells to expand, to augment their function, or to be more resistant to cell death. Examples include insulin-like growth factors, glucagon-like peptide 1, exendin, parathyroid hormone-related protein, placental lactogen, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)1 (3Devedjian J.C. George M.

Recently, we have developed a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses HGF in the pancreatic beta cell under the control of the rat insulin II promoter (RIP) (10Garcia-Ocaña A. Takane K.K. Syed M.A. Philbrick W.M. Vasavada R.C. Stewart A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 11Garcia-Ocaña A. Vasavada R.C. Cebrian A. Reddy V. Takane K.K. Lopez-Talavera J.C. Stewart A.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2752-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These RIP-HGF transgenic mice display increased beta cell proliferation coupled with increased beta cell function, the latter resulting from an increase in the expression of insulin, glucokinase, and the glucose transporter, Glut-2. We have also shown that RIP-HGF transgenic mouse islets are significantly more effective than normal islets when transplanted into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) diabetic mice (11Garcia-Ocaña A. Vasavada R.C. Cebrian A. Reddy V. Takane K.K. Lopez-Talavera J.C. Stewart A.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2752-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, a marginal number of normal islets was insufficient to normalize blood glucose levels in SCID diabetic mice. In contrast, the same number of islets from RIP-HGF transgenic mice matched for size, protein, or DNA rapidly and completely normalized the blood glucose (11Garcia-Ocaña A. Vasavada R.C. Cebrian A. Reddy V. Takane K.K. Lopez-Talavera J.C. Stewart A.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2752-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that gene transfer of the HGF cDNA into human islets could reduce the number of islets and donors required to correct diabetes in a human transplant setting. In the present study, we therefore have explored the delivery of HGF to mouse islets using an adenoviral delivery system. Specifically, we sought to (i) investigate the feasibility of adenoviral gene delivery of HGF in mouse isletsex vivo and (ii) determine the effect of adenovirus-mediated HGF overexpression on the performance of mouse islets in a marginal mass model of islet transplant. As anticipated, adenoviral delivery of HGF to mouse islets ex vivo markedly improved islet transplant survival and performance. To our surprise, this protective effect was immediate and unlikely to be explained simply by improved beta cell proliferation. Instead, this rapid protective early effect was likely explained by a combination of enhanced beta cell function in the graft induced by HGF, as occursin vivo in the RIP-HGF mice, and/or increased graft beta cell survival, a novel beta cell action of HGF. The ability of HGF to enhance beta cell survival was directly documented using standard cell death assays and was confirmed in RIP-HGF mice and the beta cell line, INS-1. Mechanistically, the survival effect of HGF in beta cells appeared to involve the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway and likely other pathways. Collectively, our prior studies with RIP-HGF mice together with the results reported in the present manuscript using adenoviral HGF gene therapy suggest that HGF overexpression in the islet markedly improves islet graft performance through a combination of effects including improved beta cell survival, enhanced glucose sensing and insulin secretion, and accelerated beta cell proliferation. Although the precise quantitative definition of these effects at specific time points in the post-transplant period will require additional study, each would appear to be important. These results suggest that ex vivo gene transfer of HGF into human islets may be particularly useful in improving islet transplant performance and reducing the number of islets required for humans with Type 1 diabetes. Adenovirus was prepared according to the methods of Becker et al. (12Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B.

They were then co-transfected with a second plasmid (pJM17) (12Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B.

After recombination and lysis of the cells, the medium was collected, and the remaining cells were lysed by freezing and thawing. The cell debris was pelleted, and the viral supernatant was saved for subsequent experiments. Adenovirus DNA was sequenced to confirm the correct orientation and sequence of β-galactosidase and mouse HGF cDNAs. Adenovirus was purified on a CsCl/Tris gradient, separated into aliquots, and stored at −80 °C until use. m.o.i. was determined by A 260and plaque assays (12Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S.

Murine islets from adult CD-1 mice were isolated as previously described (10Garcia-Ocaña A. Takane K.K. Syed M.A. Philbrick W.M. Vasavada R.C. Stewart A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pancreas was injected through the pancreatic duct with Hanks' buffered saline solution containing collagenase P, removed, incubated for 17 min at 37 °C, and then filtered through a 500-μm wire mesh. The digested pancreas was rinsed with Hanks' buffered saline solution, and islets were separated by density gradient in Histopaque (Sigma). After several washes with Hanks' buffered saline solution, islets were hand-picked under a microscope. Mouse pancreatic islets were washed with RPMI 1640 medium and exposed to purified adenovirus for 1 h at 37 °C. Islets were then washed and incubated in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm d-glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Twenty-four hours after the infection, islets were harvested and used in the experiments described below. At 24 h after infection, with 250 m.o.i. AdvLacZ under these conditions, 29 ± 6% (n = 4) of islet cells were stained for X-gal following the standard methods for staining islets infected with AdvLacZ (13Weber M. Deng S. Kucher T Shaked A. Ketchum R.J. Brayman K.L. J. Surg. Res. 1997; 69: 23-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This infection rate is comparable with that reported previously with rat and human islets (13Weber M. Deng S. Kucher T Shaked A. Ketchum R.J. Brayman K.L. J. Surg.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Total DNA-free RNA was isolated from uninfected or adenovirus-transduced islets by using the DNA-free RNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed as previously described (11Garcia-Ocaña A. Vasavada R.C. Cebrian A. Reddy V. Takane K.K. Lopez-Talavera J.C. Stewart A.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2752-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PCR was performed with 5 μl of cDNA in a final volume of 25 μl containing 1XTaq buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), 2.5 mmMgCl2 (Promega), 200 μm dNTPs (Promega), 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]deoxycitidine triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), 400 nm HGF primer pair (11Garcia-Ocaña A.

Tubes were placed in a thermal cycler, and the following program was applied: 3 min at 94 °C followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min as annealing temperature, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products (actin, 293 bp, and HGF, 146 bp) were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA buffer, and the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Islet extracts were made in freshly prepared ice-cold lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 57 μg/ml aprotinin), incubated for 30 min on ice, and sonicated, the supernatant containing the cell lysate was separated, and protein concentrations were measured using the MicroBCA assay (Pierce). Fifty micrograms of protein from uninfected or adenovirus-infected islets were resuspended in loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using standard techniques. After blocking for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antisera against the α chain of HGF (polyclonal rabbit anti-HGF antibody at 1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or against actin (rabbit polyclonal antibody at 1:400 dilution, Sigma). After several washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, blots were incubated with the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Chemiluminescence was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Insulin release from uninfected and adenovirus-transduced islets was measured in triplicate for each glucose concentration tested as previously described (11Garcia-Ocaña A. Vasavada R.C. Cebrian A. Reddy V. Takane K.K. Lopez-Talavera J.C. Stewart A.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2752-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, islets obtained 24 h after infection with AdvLacZ or AdvHGF and uninfected islets were preincubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 5.5 mm glucose for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After washing the islets once with the same solution, groups of 10 islets of similar size for each condition were incubated in 1 ml of fresh Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer plus 1% bovine serum albumin and 5.5 or 22.2 mm glucose at 37 °C in the 5% CO2 incubator. After a 30-min incubation, buffer was removed and frozen at −20 °C until insulin measurement by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Louis, MO). Islets were then washed 3 times with PBS and digested overnight in 1 ml of 0.1n NaOH at 37 °C. After neutralization with HCl, protein was measured by the Bradford method. Results are expressed as a percentage of insulin concentration obtained with uninfected islets incubated at 5.5 mm glucose. Murine CD-1 islets isolated and transduced with AdvLacZ or AdvHGF as described above were transplanted under the kidney capsule of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic, SCID mice (BALB/cByJ) (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) as previously described (11Garcia-Ocaña A. Vasavada R.C. Cebrian A. Reddy V. Takane K.K. Lopez-Talavera J.C. Stewart A.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2752-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, SCID mice were rendered diabetic by injecting 250 mg/kg of body weight of STZ intraperitoneally. Diabetes was confirmed by the presence of hyperglycemia (>300 mg/dl), polyuria, and weight loss. Random non-fasted blood glucose was measured from the snipped tail by a Precision Q.I.D. portable glucometer (Medisense, Bedford, MA). After three consecutive days of hyperglycemia, SCID diabetic mice were transplanted with either 300 uninfected or AdvLacZ- or AdvHGF-transduced islet equivalents (IE) (1 IE = 125 μm diameter islet) beneath the kidney capsule, as previously described (11Garcia-Ocaña A. Vasavada R.C. Cebrian A. Reddy V. Takane K.K. Lopez-Talavera J.C. Stewart A.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2752-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Blood glucose levels were measured at days 1, 4, and 7 and then weekly through day 56 after transplantation. At day 54, retroorbital bleedings were performed to measure plasma insulin levels. At day 56, mice transplanted with 300 IE transduced with AdvHGF, AdvLacZ, or uninfected islets underwent unilateral nephrectomy. The kidneys were fixed in Bouin's solution, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with the anti-insulin antibody, as previously reported (10Garcia-Ocaña A. Takane K.K. Syed M.A. Philbrick W.M. Vasavada R.C. Stewart A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Forty-nine days after islets were transplanted in STZ-induced SCID diabetic mice (see above), glucose tolerance was analyzed in 16-h-fasted mice by intraperitoneal injection of 2 g of glucose/kg of body weight as previously reported (11Garcia-Ocaña A. Vasavada R.C. Cebrian A. Reddy V. Takane K.K. Lopez-Talavera J.C. Stewart A.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2752-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Blood samples were obtained from the snipped tail and analyzed for glucose levels using the portable glucometer. Insulin was extracted from graft-containing kidneys as previously reported (10Garcia-Ocaña A. Takane K.K. Syed M.A. Philbrick W.M. Vasavada R.C. Stewart A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, graft-containing kidneys were washed in ice-cold PBS, finely minced, passed through a 21-gauge needle, resuspended in 5 ml of acid/ethanol (0.18 m HCl in 70% ethanol), sonicated for 15 s, and extracted at −20 °C. Tubes were then centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at −20 °C. After neutralization, the insulin content in the extracts was measured by insulin radioimmunoassay (Linco). Pancreata and graft-containing kidneys from four animals per group in each case were fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. In the graft-containing kidneys, three serial sections separated by 25 μm each were immunostained after deparaffinization and rehydration. Beta cell death was detected by co-staining for insulin and propidium iodide (Sigma) as previously reported (15Cebrian A. Garcia-Ocaña A. Takane K.K. Sipula D. Stewart A.F. Vasavada R.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3003-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunostaining was carried out with a guinea pig anti-porcine insulin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) as primary antibody followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After several washes with PBS, samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 2 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase I (Ambion) made in PBS, washed several times with water, and cover-slipped using the Prolong antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Twelve hours after the treatment of four RIP-HGF transgenic mice and four normal littermates (3–6 months old) with a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (150 mg/kg of body weight), pancreata were removed, fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and immunostained after deparaffinization and rehydration. Cell death was detected by enzymatic in situ labeling for DNA strand breaks using the TUNEL method using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Staining was achieved using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) as substrate. Subsequent to TUNEL, sections were stained with the anti-insulin antibody described above. Visualization was achieved using antibody-coupled peroxidase and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA). Cell viability was assessed by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) assay and by cell counting. Viability tests were performed in rat insulinoma cells (INS-1) cells kindly provided by Dr. Doris Stoffers (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine) and seeded at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well onto 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11 mm d-glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Forty-eight hours later, cells were refed with fresh medium containing vehicle or different agents (HGF, STZ, and/or wortmannin). Cell viability was measured 24 h after the addition of the tested agents. Cell counting was performed in the presence of trypan blue to detect non-viable cells. MTT assay was performed by incubating the cells with 0.5 mg/ml MTT for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, as previously described (16Janjic D. Wolheim C.B. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Formazan produced in the cells was dissolved with isopropanol, and absorbance was read at 570 and 690 nm. INS-1 cells and mouse islets were serum-depleted for 24 h before the addition of 25 ng/ml HGF. After a 10-min incubation, cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS and twice with ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 100 μm Na3VO4). Cells were solubilized in buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 10% glycerol, cell extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein content in the supernatant was measured by the Micro BCA method (Pierce). PI3-kinase activity was measured as previously reported (17Myers M.G. Jr. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, protein extracts were incubated with either a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-PI3-kinase p85α antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) (mouse islets and INS-1 cells) or 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Met antibody (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C for 16 h. Immunocomplexes were immunoprecipitated with recombinant protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μm Na3VO4, twice with 100 mm Tris-HCl containing 500 mm LiCl and 100 μm Na3VO4, and twice with PI3-kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μmNa3VO4). Pellets were then resuspended in PI3-kinase buffer containing 11.6 mm MgCl2, 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol, 50 μm ATP, and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 10 min at 22 °C with constant agitation. After extraction with chloroform:methanol (1:1), reaction products were resolved using thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. The protein kinase B/Akt immunoprecipitation and kinase assay was carried out with a glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) following the manufacturer's procedure. Briefly, after stimulation of the cells with 25 ng/ml HGF for 30 min, 200 μg of cell lysate was incubated with protein G/Akt 1 monoclonal antibody complex for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer, the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of glycogen synthase kinase 3 fusion protein and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with SDS gel-loading buffer, and samples were analyzed by immunoblotting (as shown above) with the phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β (Ser-21/9) antibody. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical differences were determined by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test and analysis of variance for repeated measurements. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Murine islet expression of HGF was analyzed using reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot in adenovirus-transduced mouse islets harvested 24 h after infection. As shown in Fig. 1, HGF was highly expressed in AdvHGF-transduced islets both in terms of mRNA (Fig. 1 A) as well as protein (Fig. 1 B) as compared with non-transduced or AdvLacZ-transduced islets. These results indicate that AdvHGF-transduced murine islets effectively produce HGF. To determine whether insulin secretion by mouse islets was adversely affected by adenovirus infection, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was examined 24 h after adenoviral transduction. Insulin release was corrected for islet protein as described under “Materials and Methods” and in the legend to Fig. 2. The insulin secretory response from islets transduced with 250 m.o.i. of AdvLacZ or AdvHGF was similar to non-transduced islets (Fig. 2). This indicates that adenovirus-transduced islet function at 250 m.o.i. is not adversely affected. In contrast, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was markedly blunted in islets transduced with 500 m.o.i. of either AdvLacZ or AdvHGF (Fig. 2). These studies suggest that 250 m.o.i. is an optimal and perhaps maximal m.o.i. for the studies described below. We next compared the performance of uninfected and AdvLacZ- and AdvHGF-transduced islets in vivo using a marginal mass islet renal transplant model in STZ-induced diabetic SCID mice. As is clear in Fig. 3 A, 300 uninfected IE (125-μm diameter) were insufficient to maintain euglycemia during the 8-week period of this study. Similarly, 300 AdvLacZ-transduced IE were unable to sustain a blood glucose value under 300 mg/dl (Fig. 3 A). In marked contrast, however, 300 AdvHGF-transduced IE were able to immediately reduce blood glucose concentrations in the diabetic SCID renal transplant model (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, this dramatic decrease in the blood glucose was sustained for the complete 8 weeks of the study. These glucose concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than in mice transplanted with 300 uninfected or AdvLacZ-transduced IE. In addition, random, non-fasting plasma insulin levels at day 54 after the transplant were significantly (p < 0.025) increased in SCID mice transplanted with AdvHGF-transduced islets (1.62 ± 0.24 ng/ml, n = 8) compared with mice transplanted with AdvLacZ-transduced islets (0.90 ± 0.11 ng/ml, n = 10). After removal of the kidney containing the AdvHGF islet grafts on day 56, blood glucose levels immediately returned to pre-transplant diabetic levels, confirming that the transplant was responsible for reducing the blood glucose (Fig. 3 A). Representative photomicrographs of kidney sections containing the grafts and stained for insulin are shown in Fig. 3 B. Grafts were easily and abundantly visualized in each of the eight kidneys containing AdvHGF-transduced islets. This was in marked contrast to kidneys containing AdvLacZ-transduced islets in which the islet graft was either undetectable despite aggressive sectioning (8 of 1"

In this study, bile acid effects on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis were examined to gain insight into bile acid potentiation of death receptor signaling. TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HuH-7 cells, stably transfected with a bile acid transporter, was enhanced by bile acids. Caspase 8 and 10 activation, bid cleavage, cytosolic cytochrome c, and caspase 3 activation by TRAIL were all increased by the bile acid glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDCA). GCDCA (100 μm) did not alter expression of TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5, procaspase 8, cFLIP-L, cFLIP-s, Bax, Bcl-xL, or Bax. However, both caspase 8 and caspase 10 recruitment and processing within the TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) were greater in GCDCA-treated cells whereas recruitment of cFLIP long and short was reduced. GCDCA stimulated phosphorylation of both cFLIP isoforms, which was associated with decreased binding to GST-FADD. The protein kinase C antagonist chelerythrine prevented bile acid-stimulated cFLIP-L and -s phosphorylation, restored cFLIP binding to GST-FADD, and attenuated bile acid potentiation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of bile acid cytotoxicity and the proapoptotic effects of cFLIP phosphorylation in TRAIL signaling.

Bile acids accumulate within the liver in cholestasis, a pathologic condition characterized by impaired bile acid canalicular secretion. Elevated bile acid concentrations within the liver promote liver injury and the development of liver cirrhosis and liver failure (1Greim H. Trulzsch D. Czygan P. Rudick J. Hutterer F. Schaffner F.

Schaffner F. Hum. Pathol. 1970; 1: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For example, children with the progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) subtype 2 syndrome lack the canalicular transport protein for bile acid secretion, and develop a progressive liver disease caused by the inability to excrete bile acids from hepatocytes (4Strautnieks S.S. Bull L.N. Knisely A.S. Kocoshis S.A. Dahl N. Arnell H. Sokal E. Dahan K. Childs S. Ling V. Tanner M.S. Kagalwalla A.F. Nemeth A. Pawlowska J. Baker A. Mieli-Vergani G. Freimer N.B. Gardiner R.M.

Dis. 2000; 4: 357-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that bile acids mediate their cytotoxicity by inducing cellular apoptosis. Bile acid apoptosis appears to be death receptor-dependent. For example, toxic bile acids trigger oligomerization of Fas in a ligand-independent manner by promoting trafficking of intracellular Fas to the plasma membrane (6Faubion W.A. Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Roberts P.J. Svingen P.A. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In the absence of Fas, toxic bile acids enhance TRAIL-R21/DR5 expression and aggregation also promoting a death receptor-dependent apoptosis (7Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y. Werneburg N. Takimoto R., El- Deiry W. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38610-38618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The in vivorelevance of these in vitro observations has been amply demonstrated. Liver injury and fibrosis are significantly diminished in Fas-deficient lpr mice during cholestasis following bile duct ligation (8Miyoshi H. Rust C. Roberts P.J. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J.

Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1323-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Likewise, hepatic DR5/TRAIL-R2 expression is increased in the bile duct-ligated mouse sensitizing the liver to TRAIL-mediated hepatotoxicity (10Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Taniai M. Cambay A. Gores G.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, bile acid modulation of death receptor signaling plays a critical role in cholestatic liver injury. Further insights into how toxic bile acids promote death receptor cytotoxic signaling would, therefore, be of scientific and potentially therapeutic relevance. Once aggregated, both death receptors Fas and DR5/TRAIL-R2 signal cell death by inducing a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) composed of the cytoplasmic adapter protein FADD (Fas-associated death domain) and initiator caspases, procaspase 8 and 10 (11–13). Procaspases are recruited to the DISC via homotypic interactions between death effector domains (DED) of both FADD and the initiator caspases. Once recruited to the DISC, these procaspases undergo autocatalytic processing within the DISC (14Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar, 15Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). Procaspase 8, which exists as p55 and p53 isoforms, is first cleaved to p43/41 forms releasing a C-terminal p10 subunit and then subsequently processed to produce p23, p18, and p10 subunits. The p18 and p10 subunits combine to form a heterotetramer, the active form of this protease (14Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

Likewise, procaspase 10, which exists as a p54 and two p59 isoforms with active protease domains, is initially cleaved to p47/43 forms releasing a C-terminal p12 subunit, and then processed to produce the active p25 and p22/17, and p12 subunits (13Kischkel F.C.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). The cleaved or truncated form of Bid (tBid) translocates to mitochondria and induces cytochrome c release into the cytosol, which then binds to apoptosis-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), resulting in activation of caspase 9, followed by activation of effector caspases, caspase 3, 6, and 7 (14Thornberry N.A.

The effector caspases cleave a variety of cellular targets inducing the stereotypic morphologic features of apoptosis. Although both caspase 8 and 10 activation occurs in death receptor signaling, caspase 8 is essential for cell death in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (19Varfolomeev E.E. Schuchmann M. Luria V.

However, the caspase domain lacks the critical active site cysteine residue essential for catalytic activity. The short form of cFLIP, cFLIP-s, is also composed of two death effector domains, a structure resembling the N-terminal half of procaspase 8, but lacks the entire caspase domain (29Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Both cFLIP-L and cFLIP-s bind to FADD within the DISC via DED-DED homotypic interactions. cFLIP-s directly inhibits caspase 8 activation within the DISC. Interestingly, cFLIP-L is first cleaved within the DISC in a caspase dependent manner to a p43 polypeptide (33Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Biol.

A potential mechanism by which toxic bile acids may promote death receptor cytotoxic signaling is by modulating the composition of the DISC. Thus, the overall objective of this study was to examine the effects of bile acids on the TRAIL DISC. We employed HuH-7 cells stably transfected with the sodium-dependent transporting polypeptide to ensure bile acid transport and GCDCA as the cytotoxic bile acid as its concentrations are increased in cholestasis. TRAIL-mediated death receptor signaling was examined as a relevant model of death receptor signaling modulated by bile acids (7Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y. Werneburg N. Takimoto R., El- Deiry W.

The results demonstrate that bile acids sensitize cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by stimulating cFLIP phosphorylation, which reduces its translocation to the DISC thereby facilitating activation of caspases 8 and 10.

Established clones (HuH-BAT for HuH-Bile Acid Transporting) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100,000 units/liter), streptomycin (100 mg/liter), gentamycin (100 mg/liter), and G418 (1,200 mg/liter). The extracellular portion of human TRAIL (amino acids 95–281) was subcloned into the pFLAG expression plasmid (Sigma Chemicals Co.) between XhoI andXbaI restriction sites. The N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged TRAIL was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified over an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2)-agarose column (Sigma Chemicals Co.) (36Schneider P.

After insoluble debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected. Samples were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with appropriate primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,000. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated at a dilution of 1:2,000 to 1:10,000. Bound antibody was visualized using the chemiluminescent substrate (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film. Cytosolic extracts for cytochromec immunoblot assay were obtained as described by Leistet al. (38Leist M. Volbracht C. Fava E. Nicotera P. Mol.

Briefly, at the desired time points, the culture medium was exchanged with permeabilization buffer (210 mm d-mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm succinate, 0.2 mmEGTA, 0.15% bovine serum albumin, 80 μg/ml digitonin, pH 7.2). The cells were incubated in this buffer for 5 min on ice. The permeabilization buffer was then removed and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants representing the cytosolic extract were employed for the immunoblot analysis. HuH-BAT cells were treated with FLAG-TRAIL (200 ng/ml) plus anti-FLAG M2 antibody (2 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of GCDCA (50 μm). At desired time points, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed by incubation on ice for 30 min in the same lysis buffer described in immunoblot analysis. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For time 0, 1 ml of cell lysate from untreated cells was supplemented with 0.5 μg of FLAG-TRAIL and 1 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody. After the protein concentration in the extracts was determined by Bradford assay, cell lysates containing 3 mg of protein in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer were precleared by incubation with 30 μl of Sepharose-CL 4B for 3 h at 4 °C, and then aliquots of protein G-Sepharose (30 μl) were added for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 ×g, washed five times with lysis buffer, and released from the beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and sequentially probed with antibodies for DR4, DR5, caspase 8, caspase 10, FADD, and cFLIP. The pGex4T-2 construct containing GST fused to full-length FADD was kindly provided by Dr. M. Peter (University of Chicago). E. coli strain DH5α cells transformed with this construct were grown overnight in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside. GST-FADD was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol and eluted by incubation with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The eluted GST-FADD was dialyzed against PBS overnight. After HuH-BAT cells were treated with GCDCA (100 μm) for 3 h, cell lysates were prepared by freezing and thawing cells in PBS containing the same protease and phosphatase inhibitors described above for the lysis buffer. Aliquots containing 3 mg of protein were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with purified GST-FADD. Glutathione-Sepharose was added for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. FADD-bound proteins were then pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 × g, washed five times with PBS buffer containing the protease and phosphatase inhibitors described above for the lysis buffer, and released from the beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Recovery of procaspase 8, procaspase 10, and cFLIP was assessed by immunoblot analysis. A human cDNA for cFLIP was a gift from Dr. P. Dent (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). cDNA encoding amino acids 1–202 was subcloned into green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expression plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) at the Kpn-I site. The plasmid pEGFP-cFLIP was transfected into the HuH-BAT cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Forty-eight hours later, the cells were treated with FLAG-TRAIL plus M2 antibodies in the presence or absence of GCDCA (100 μm). The cFLIP-GFP fluorescence was continuously observed by employing fluorescence microscopy (TE200 Nikon Inverted Fluorescent Microscope, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and the cellular distribution of green fluorescence was visualized at 30-min intervals. To visualize co-localization of the cFLIP-GFP and DR5, immunofluorescence for DR5 immunoreactivity was performed as described previously (7Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y. Werneburg N. Takimoto R., El- Deiry W. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38610-38618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with goat anti-DR5 primary antisera (1:300 dilution) for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes, 10 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Axiovert 100 m-LSM 510, Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Excitation and emission wavelengths for GFP were 488 and 505 nm, respectively, and for Alexa Fluor 633 the excitation and emission wavelengths were 633 and 650 nm, respectively. HuH-BAT cells in 10-cm plates were incubated with γ-32P (200 μCi/ml) in the presence or absence of DC or GDCA (100 μm) for 3 h. Cells were lysed with the lysis buffer described under “Immunoblot Analysis.” After the protein concentration in the extracts was determined, cell lysates containing 4 mg of protein in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer were precleared by incubation with 30 μl of Sepharose-CL 4B for 3 h at 4 °C. cFLIP protein was immunoprecipitated by incubation with rat monoclonal (IgG2a) anti-cFLIP (Alexis) antibody (5 μg) and protein G-Sepharose (30 μl) for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 ×g, washed five times with lysis buffer, and released from the beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Radioactivity was determined by autoradiography at −70 °C overnight. All data represent at least three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. Differences between groups were compared using analysis of variance for repeated measures and a post-hoc Bonferroni test to correct for multiple comparisons. Initially, the effects of various bile acids on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was carefully characterized using the bile acid transporting HuH-BAT cells. Cellular apoptosis was minimal (<15%) following treatment of the cells with the unconjugated and conjugated forms of DCA and CDCA (50 μm) for 4 h (Fig. 1, A and B). TRAIL itself (100 ng/ml) induced only slight apoptosis over the same time period, 27 ± 3% apoptosis. In contrast, all of the bile acids (50 μm) studied markedly sensitized cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Of the bile acids examined, unconjugated and glycine conjugates of DCA and CDCA were the most potent in enhancing TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and increased TRAIL-mediated apoptosis ∼4-fold (Fig. 1, A and B). The ability of bile acids to enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2). Both GCDCA and GDCA at a concentration of 50 μm enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis as the concentration of TRAIL was increased (0–1,600 ng/ml), with maximum cell killing at TRAIL concentrations of ≥400 ng/ml (Fig. 2,A and C). Likewise, cells were increasingly sensitized to TRAIL (50 ng/ml) cytotoxicity as the concentration of bile acid was increased (0–200 μm); maximum cell killing was observed with a bile acid concentration of 100 μm for GCDCA and a concentration 50 μm for GDCA (Fig. 2,B and D). At all the conditions tested, cellular apoptosis was synergistically increased by the combination of the bile acid and TRAIL. These data demonstrate that bile acids sensitize cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Because GCDCA is one of the major bile acids in human bile (39Hofmann A.F. Hepatology. 1990; 12 (; discussion 22S-25S.): 17S-22SPubMed Google Scholar), we choose GCDCA for subsequent experiments.Figure 2Glycine-conjugated bile acids potently sensitize cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. HuH-BAT cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of FLAG-TRAIL plus anti-FLAG M2 antibody (2 μg/ml) or M2 antibody alone in the presence or absence of either GCDCA (panels A and B) or GDCA (panels C and D) for 12 h. Apoptosis was evaluated by DAPI staining and fluorescence microscopy. All data were expressed as mean ± S.D. from three individual experiments.p < 0.01 for no bile acid group versuseither GCDCA (panel A) or GDCA-treated group at all the TRAIL concentrations tested. p < 0.01 for TRAIL-treated group versus no TRAIL group at all the bile acid concentrations tested (GCDCA in panel B, GDCA inpanel D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in HuH-BAT cells, a hepatocyte-derived cell line, occurs via the Type II pathway (Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release, and subsequent activation of caspase 3). Bile acids, therefore, could sensitize cells to TRAIL cytotoxicity by either enhancing initiator caspase activation and Bid cleavage and/or promoting mitochondrial dysfunction with cytochromec release. To distinguish between these two possibilities, immunoblot analysis for apoptotic effector proteins upstream (caspase 8/10, tBid) and downstream of mitochondria (cytosolic cytochromec and caspase 3) was examined. GCDCA (50 μm) alone did not activate this signaling cascade. After treatment of HuH-BAT cells with TRAIL (100 ng/ml) for 0–8 h, immunoblot analysis of cell lysates demonstrated processed polypeptides for both initiator caspases, caspase 8 and 10, appearance of"

In this work, we found that inhibition of platelet adenylyl cyclase by dideoxyadenosine or SQ22536 did not cause activation of Rap1B and did not restore Rap1B activation in platelets stimulated by cross-linking of Fcγ receptor IIA (FcγRIIA) in the presence of ADP scavengers. Moreover, elevation of the intracellular cAMP concentration did not impair the Gi-dependent activation of Rap1B. Two unrelated inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), wortmannin and LY294002, totally prevented Rap1B activation in platelets stimulated by cross-linking of FcγRIIA, by stimulation of the P2Y12 receptor for ADP, or by epinephrine. However, in platelets from PI3Kγ-deficient mice, both ADP and epinephrine were still able to normally stimulate Rap1B activation through a PI3K-dependent mechanism, suggesting the involvement of a different isoform of the enzyme. Moreover, the lack of PI3Kγ did not prevent the ability of epinephrine to potentiate platelet aggregation through a Gi-dependent pathway. The inhibitory effect of wortmannin on Rap1B activation was overcome by addition of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), but not PtdIns(3,4)P2, although both lipids were found to support phosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was able to relieve the inhibitory effect of apyrase on FcγRIIA-mediated platelet aggregation. We conclude that stimulation of a Gi-dependent signaling pathway causes activation of the small GTPase Rap1B through the action of the PI3K product PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but not PtdIns(3,4)P2, and that this process may contribute to potentiation of platelet aggregation.

Lapetina E.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In resting cells, it is mainly located at the membrane, but it translocates to the cytosol upon phosphorylation by protein kinase A (2Lapetina E.G. Lacal J.C. Reep B.R. Molina y Vedia L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3131-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In activated platelets, Rap1B rapidly interacts with the reorganized actin-based cytoskeleton (3Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. Lacal J.C. White G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19405-19408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As other GTPases, Rap1B is activated by binding of GTP. Platelet stimulation by different agonists, such as thrombin, collagen, and ADP, induces the rapid binding of GTP to Rap1B (4Torti M. Lapetina E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7796-7800Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). An increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in stimulated platelets has been shown to be sufficient to promote Rap1B activation, and specific Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rap1B have been identified (5Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 6Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) have recently described a new pathway for Rap1B activation that is initiated by stimulation of membrane Gi-coupled receptors and that is independent of intracellular Ca2+ increases. In fact, the sole binding of ADP to the P2Y12 receptor, as well as the interaction of epinephrine with the α2A-adrenergic receptor, is sufficient to trigger Rap1B activation. Moreover, we have found that agonists that activate platelets through stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors, such as the thromboxane A2 analog U46619, or through stimulation of a tyrosine kinase-based pathway, such as in the case of cross-linking of FcγRIIA,1totally rely on binding of secreted ADP to the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor to activate Rap1B (7Lova P. Paganini S. Sinigaglia F. Balduini C. Torti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12009-12015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Finally, activation of Rap1B induced by ADP or epinephrine is prevented in Gαi2- and Gαz-deficient mice, respectively (8Woulfe D. Jiang H. Mortensen R. Yang Y. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). During the last few years, activation of a Gi-dependent signaling pathway has been recognized to represent a crucial event absolutely required to elicit full platelet activation. For instance, platelet responsiveness to the thromboxane A2 analog U46619, to protease-activated receptor-1-activating peptide, or to cross-linking of FcγRIIA is strongly compromised when secretion is prevented by protein kinase C inhibitors or when extracellular ADP is neutralized by specific scavengers, such as apyrase or creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase (9Lau L.F.

Blood. 2000; 96: 3439-3446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been clearly shown that, although ADP can bind to two different G-protein-coupled receptors on the platelet surface (the P2Y1 receptor coupled to Gq and the P2Y12 receptor coupled to Gi), only the latter one is responsible for potentiation of platelet activation induced by other agonists (10Paul B.Z.S.

Payrastre B. Blood. 2000; 96: 3439-3446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanism for the Gi-mediated potentiation of platelet activation is still unclear. The α-subunits of the Gi family of heterotrimeric G-proteins are known to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, but several findings indicate that reduction of basal cAMP levels does not contribute to ADP-mediated potentiation of platelet activation (13Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Kim Y.B. Kunapuli S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). By contrast, several studies using specific cell-permeable inhibitors have suggested a crucial role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in this event (11Trumel C. Payrastre B. Plantavid M.

The recent finding that stimulation of a Gi-coupled receptor is sufficient to trigger activation of Rap1B also suggests that this small GTPase could be involved in potentiation of platelet aggregation. In this work, we have investigated the mechanism of Rap1B activation downstream of stimulation of Gi-coupled receptors in an attempt to reveal a correlation between this small GTPase and the potentiation of agonist-induced platelet activation. We have found that inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is not sufficient to stimulate GTP binding to Rap1B. By contrast, it is shown here that PI3K plays an important role in the Gi-mediated activation of Rap1B. We also provide evidence suggesting that activation of Rap1B downstream of PI3K is associated with the Gi-mediated potentiation of platelet activation. Epinephrine, ADP, thrombin, sheep anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragments, apyrase, creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, and adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) were from Sigma. Dideoxyadenosine, SQ22536, wortmannin, and LY294002 were from Alexis. AR-C69931MX was a generous gift from AstraZeneca (Charnwood, UK). Di-C16-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3and Di-C16-PtdIns(3,4)P2 were from Matreya, Inc. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) IV.3 against FcγRIIA was obtained from Medarex. Sepharose CL-2B, GSH-Sepharose 2B, and the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate were from Amersham Biosciences. The rabbit polyclonal antiserum against Rap1B was described previously (16Winegar D.A. Ohmstede C.A. Chu L. Reep B.R. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4375-4380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal and monoclonal (5G3) antibodies against Akt and phospho-Akt Thr308 were from New England Biolabs, Inc. The cDNA for the Rap-binding domain (RBD) of the Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator was kindly provided by Dr. Johannes L. Bos (Department of Physiological Chemistry, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Bio-Rad. Human platelets were isolated by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-2B and eluted with HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, and 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4) as previously described (17Torti M. Ramaschi G. Sinigaglia F. Lapetina E.G. Balduini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7553-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Platelet concentration was adjusted to 0.35 × 109 platelets/ml. Platelet samples (0.5 ml) were incubated at 37 °C in an aggregometer under constant stirring and typically stimulated with 10 μm ADP and 1 μm epinephrine or by cross-linking of FcγRIIA through addition of 2 μg/ml mAb IV.3 for 2 min, followed by 30 μg/ml sheep anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragments. Platelet stimulation was typically performed for 1 min. Where indicated, 1 unit/ml apyrase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 40 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 500 μm PAPS, or 100 nm AR-C69931MX was added to the platelet samples 2 min before stimulation. Preincubation with wortmannin or LY294002 was performed for 15 min at 37 °C. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was achieved by incubation of platelets with 100 μm dideoxyadenosine or 300 μm SQ22536 for 30 min. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the platelet suspension at a final concentration of 30 μm. Measurement of platelet aggregation was performed under the same conditions indicated above, and aggregation was monitored continuously over 10 min. Activation of Rap1B was evaluated using GST-RBD immobilized on GSH-Sepharose, which is known to bind specifically and selectively the GTP-bound form of Rap1B from a platelet lysate. Platelet stimulation was stopped by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold modified 2× RIPA buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin, 0.2 μm aprotinin, and 0.2 mmNa3VO4). Cell lysis was performed on ice for 10 min, and the insoluble material was eliminated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Recombinant purified GST-RBD was coupled to GSH-Sepharose by incubating 200 μg of the protein with 100 μl of GSH-Sepharose (75% slurry) for 2 h at room temperature under constant tumbling and then added to the cleared platelet lysates (20 μg of GST-RBD/sample). Precipitation of GTP-bound Rap1B was performed by incubation at 4 °C for 45 min. The precipitates were collected by brief centrifugation, washed three times with modified 1× RIPA buffer, and finally resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 4% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). Precipitated Rap1B was separated by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% acrylamide gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The presence of active Rap1B in precipitates with GST-RBD was evaluated by staining the nitrocellulose filters with a specific polyclonal antiserum directed against Rap1B, used at a final dilution of 1:1000. Reactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. Data in all figures are representative of at least three separate experiments. Platelet samples (0.2 ml, 109 platelets/ml) were incubated at 37 °C and stimulated as indicated in the figure legends for 1 min. Platelets were lysed in 2% SDS in HEPES buffer, and protein concentration was determined. Aliquots containing 80 μg of total platelet lysates were heated at 96 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, separated on 12% acrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with anti-phospho-Akt Thr308 antibody and then reprobed with anti-Akt antibody. Analysis of Akt phosphorylation in platelets stimulated by cross-linking of FcγRIIA was performed with immunoprecipitated Akt because preliminary experiments revealed a cross-reactivity of the anti-phospho-Akt Thr308 antibody with the heavy chains of mAb IV.3, used to activate FcγRIIA, that compromised the interpretation of the results (data not shown). Platelet samples were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer and precleared with protein A-Sepharose. The precleared lysates that were also devoid of mAb IV.3 were used to immunoprecipitate Akt with mAb 5G3. Immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Akt Thr308 antibody and reprobed with anti-Akt antibody. PI3Kγ-deficient mice were generated as previously described (18Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C. Azzolino O. Pirola L. Silengo L. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Altruda F. Wymann M.P. Science. 2000; 287: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Blood was collected from anesthetized mice from the inferior vena cava into syringes containing heparin solution (5 units/ml). Blood was centrifuged at 90 ×g for 10 min, and the platelet-rich plasma was collected. Aggregation studies were directly performed with the platelet-rich plasma upon adjustment of the platelet count to 2 × 108 platelets/ml with autologous platelet-poor plasma. For analysis of Rap1B activation, washed platelets were prepared by centrifuging the platelet-rich plasma at 150 × g for 10 min. The platelet pellet was washed once with 0.038% trisodium citrate, 0.6% glucose, and 0.72 NaCl, pH 7.0, containing 25 ng/ml prostaglandin E1 and finally resuspended in HEPES buffer at a final concentration of 3 × 108 platelets/ml. Stimulation of platelet samples (0.4 ml), lysis, and pull-down assay for Rap1B activation were performed as described above. We have previously demonstrated that stimulation of a Gi-dependent pathway by epinephrine or by binding of ADP to the P2Y12receptor is sufficient to trigger activation of the small GTPase Rap1B and that Rap1B activation promoted by cross-linking of FcγRIIA is completely dependent on the stimulation of the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor by secreted ADP (7Lova P. Paganini S. Sinigaglia F. Balduini C. Torti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12009-12015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To investigate the signaling pathway linking Gi to Rap1B, we first analyzed the possible role of Gαi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Gel-filtered platelets were treated with two different membrane-permeable inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase (SQ22536 and dideoxyadenosine), and activation of Rap1B was evaluated upon precipitation of the GTP-bound form of the protein with GST-RBD. Although SQ22536 and dideoxyadenosine were used at concentrations reported to maximally inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (13Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Kim Y.B. Kunapuli S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), neither compound by itself caused detectable activation of Rap1B (Fig. 1 A). These results are in agreement with those recently reported by Woulfe et al.(8Woulfe D. Jiang H. Mortensen R. Yang Y. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, we considered the possibility that, although not sufficient by itself to induce Rap1B activation, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase could contribute to this process in association with co-stimulation of other signaling pathways. In platelets stimulated by cross-linking of FcγRIIA, activation of Rap1B is suppressed by the ADP scavenger creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase, but is restored by the simultaneous addition of epinephrine (7Lova P. Paganini S. Sinigaglia F. Balduini C. Torti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12009-12015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the presence of creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase, neither SQ22536 nor dideoxyadenosine was able to restore Rap1B activation upon cross-linking of FcγRIIA (Fig. 1 A). This indicates that the contribution of the Gi pathway to Rap1B activation does not require the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by the G-protein α-subunit. We also considered that the very low intracellular levels of cAMP in resting platelets may represent a permissive condition to allow agonist-induced Rap1B activation. To verify this possibility, human platelets were incubated with prostaglandin E1 to stimulate adenylyl cyclase and to increase cAMP levels and then treated with agonists that activate Rap1B through stimulation of Gi. Fig. 1 B shows that, even when intracellular cAMP levels were increased by prostaglandin E1, activation of Rap1B induced by clustering of FcγRIIA, epinephrine, or ADP occurred normally. Taken together, these results indicate that the Gi-mediated activation of Rap1B is completely independent of the modulation of intracellular cAMP levels. It is known that activation of Gi is necessary to support full platelet secretion and aggregation as well as Rap1B activation induced by U46619 or by cross-linking of FcγRIIA (7Lova P. Paganini S.

Moreover, it has been shown that PI3K plays a crucial role in the Gi-mediated potentiation of platelet activation and is required for irreversible aggregation (11Trumel C. Payrastre B. Plantavid M.

Therefore, we investigated the role of PI3K in FcγRIIA-mediated activation of Rap1B using two structurally unrelated inhibitors of the enzyme, wortmannin and LY294002. Fig. 2 A shows how activation of Rap1B induced by clustering of FcγRIIA was totally suppressed by both compounds. By contrast, Rap1B activation induced by thrombin was not significantly affected by LY294002 (Fig. 2 A) or by wortmannin (data not shown). We have previously shown that FcγRIIA-induced activation of Rap1B requires the binding of secreted ADP to the P2Y12 receptor (7Lova P. Paganini S. Sinigaglia F. Balduini C. Torti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12009-12015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To verify whether, upon FcγRIIA recruitment, PI3K signals to Rap1B downstream of the Gi-coupled receptor for ADP, human platelets were stimulated by cross-linking of FcγRIIA in the presence of PAPS, a selective antagonist of the P2Y1 receptor for ADP. Under these conditions, secreted ADP can bind exclusively to the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor. As shown in Fig. 2 B, binding of secreted ADP to the P2Y12receptor was sufficient to allow Rap1B activation in response to FcγRIIA cross-linking. Moreover, under these conditions, inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin or LY294002 still completely suppressed activation of Rap1B (Fig. 2 B). To further demonstrate that PI3K lies downstream of the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor, we analyzed Rap1B activation in response to exogenous ADP. Fig. 3 A shows that, when exogenous ADP was allowed to bind exclusively to the P2Y12 receptor,i.e. in the presence of PAPS, activation of Rap1B was prevented by the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. Finally, we analyzed the role of PI3K in Rap1B activation induced by epinephrine, which binds exclusively to the Gi-coupled α2A-adrenergic receptor on the platelet surface. Fig. 3 B shows that both wortmannin and LY294002 almost completely suppressed epinephrine-induced activation of Rap1B. These results confirm and extend previously reported data (8Woulfe D. Jiang H. Mortensen R. Yang Y. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and indicate that PI3K is a key element in the Gi-dependent pathway for Rap1B activation. It is known that human platelets express different isoforms of PI3K (23Rittenhouse S.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 4401-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least two members of the class I PI3K family, viz. PI3Kβ and PI3Kγ, are activated by G-protein βγ-dimers (24Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and therefore may represent the isoforms linking Gi to Rap1B. To investigate the possible role of PI3Kγ, we compared agonist-induced activation of Rap1B in platelets from PI3Kγ-deficient and wild-type mice. Because mouse platelets do not express FcγRIIA, these studies have been performed using ADP and epinephrine as Rap1B activators. As shown in Fig. 4, activation of Rap1B induced by ADP or epinephrine in PI3Kγ-deficient platelets was almost identical to that observed in platelets from wild-type mice. This finding argues against a role for PI3Kγ in coupling activation of Gi to Rap1B. However, because several intracellular messengers, including calcium, diacylglycerol, and tyrosine kinases, can mediate Rap1 activation (6Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), we considered that, in the absence of PI3Kγ, other signaling pathways may become predominant and result in an almost equally efficient activation of Rap1B. By using a selective antagonist of the P2Y12receptor, we found that, in both wild-type and PI3Kγ−/−mice, ADP-induced activation of Rap1B was equally dependent on stimulation of the Gi-coupled receptor (Fig. 4). Moreover, in both control and PI3Kγ-deficient platelets, ADP- or epinephrine-induced activation of Rap1B was still prevented by the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 (Fig. 4) and wortmannin (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that a PI3K isoform different from PI3Kγ is involved in the Gi-mediated activation of Rap1B. Both PI3K and Rap1B have been hypothesized to be involved in the Gi-dependent potentiation of platelet aggregation. Because activation of Rap1B downstream of Gioccurs normally in PI3Kγ−/− mice, these platelets represent a good model to test the specific contribution of PI3Kγversus Rap1B to epinephrine-induced potentiation of platelet aggregation. In mouse platelets, ADP caused a reversible platelet aggregation that required the concomitant stimulation of the Gq-coupled P2Y1 and Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptors. A small (but significant) reduction of ADP-induced platelet aggregation in PI3Kγ−/− mice was reported in an earlier study (32Hirsch E. Bosco O. Tropel P. Laffargue M. Calvez R. Altruda F. Wymann M.P. Montrucchio G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2019-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This effect was more evident when low doses of ADP were used to stimulate washed platelets. In the present work, such inhibition was negligible because we used high doses of ADP to stimulate platelets in platelet-rich plasma. However, Fig. 5 shows that selective blockade of the P2Y12 receptor strongly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by high doses of ADP in both wild-type and PI3Kγ−/− mice. However, in the presence of the P2Y12 receptor antagonist, addition of epinephrine, which activates a Gi-dependent signaling pathway leading to stimulation of Rap1B activation, strongly, although not completely, restored ADP-induced platelet aggregation in both wild-type and PI3Kγ−/− platelets. This indicates that PI3Kγ is involved neither in Rap1B activation nor in the Gi-dependent potentiation of platelet aggregation. Activation of PI3K leads to the accumulation of the lipid products PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2, which, in turn, promote stimulation of Akt. To investigate the role of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in Rap1B activation, we analyzed their ability to relieve the inhibition of Rap1B activation in wortmannin-treated platelets. Preliminary experiments with permeabilized platelets revealed that saponin treatment caused an almost total loss of platelet responsiveness to the analyzed agonists (data not shown). However, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 have been shown to trigger biological responses even when added to whole cells (19Derman M.P. Toker A. Hartwig J.H. Spokes K. Falck J.R. Chen C.S.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) mediated the STAT1/NF-κB synergy for transcription of the gene for CXC ligand 9 (CXCL9), an interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-inducible chemokine. Reporter gene analysis showed that expression of CBP potentiated IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα)-induced promoter activity and that the CBP-mediated synergy depended upon STAT1- and NF-κB-binding sites in the promoter. Experiments with CBP mutants indicated that the N-terminal and C-terminal regions were necessary for the transcriptional synergy, although the histone acetyltransferase activity of CBP was dispensable. A co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that STAT1 and NF-κB RelA (p65) simultaneously associated with CBP in vivo. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that, although costimulation with IFN-γ and TNFα did not cooperatively enhance the levels of acetylated histones, it did result in increased recruitment of STAT1, CBP, and RNA polymerase II at the promoter region of the CXCL 9 gene. Together, these results demonstrate that the STAT1/NF-κB-dependent transcriptional synergy could result from the enhanced recruitment of RNA polymerase II complex to the promoter via simultaneous interaction of CBP with STAT1 and NF-κB.

Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)1promotes the development of cell-mediated immunity and functions cooperatively with other extracellular stimulus such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or lipopolysaccharide to induce the expression of a number of proinflammatory genes including major histocompatibility complex class I (1Johnson D.R.

NF-κB plays critical roles in transcriptional regulation of numerous genes involved in host-defense mechanisms (6Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4591) Google Scholar). Prototypically, the NF-κB1 (p50)/RelA (p65) heterodimer is sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitor protein IκB. Upon stimulation with extracellular signals such as proinflammatory cytokines or bacterial or viral components, IκB is phosphorylated by IκB kinases, ubiquitinated, and degraded by 26 S proteasomes. After degradation of IκB, NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus and binds to κB elements found in many inflammatory genes (7Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are phosphorylated at a single tyrosine residue via members of the Jak kinase family following stimulation with cytokines, hormones, or growth factors; are assembled in dimeric form; are translocated to the nucleus; and become bound to specific DNA sequence motifs (8Schindler C.

The NF-κB- and STAT-dependent signaling pathways are integral to the transcriptional regulation of many inflammatory genes, and these transcriptional factors often cooperatively regulate the transcriptional activation of many genes (4Jahnke A.

Transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and closely related p300 play a critical role in various aspects of transcriptional regulation (17Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 18Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar, 19Westin S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One of the major functions of coactivator CBP/p300 is to function as a bridging factor between sequence-specific transcriptional activator and basal transcriptional machinery and to assemble them to form a stable multiprotein complex. CBP/p300 also possesses an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which modifies the histone tail to destabilize the chromatin structure and thus increase the accessibility of the basal transcriptional machinery to the DNA template (20Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar, 21Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Furthermore, HAT alters the activities of a number of nonhistone transcription factors such as p53 by acetylating them and thereby stimulates their DNA binding and transcriptional activities (23Gu W.

Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that CBP might play an essential role in the transcriptional synergy between STAT1 and NF-κB in inflammatory gene expression. In this study we explored the mechanisms through which CBP integrates the cross-talk between IFN-γ/STAT1 and TNFα/NF-κB signaling pathways to cooperatively induce the transcriptional activation of the gene for CXCL9, an IFN-γ-inducible chemokine (13Farber J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5238-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 29Farber J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The results presented in this study demonstrate that CBP mediates the transcriptional synergy between IFN-γ/STAT1 and TNFα/NF-κB in the CXCL9 gene. Whereas the HAT activity of CBP was dispensable for the synergy, the N-terminal 450 residues and C-terminal region between amino acids 1779 and 2027 were required to mediate the transcriptional synergy. Consistent with this and extending prior studies, STAT1 and NF-κB were shown to simultaneously interact with the N- and C-terminal regions of CBP. Furthermore, the results of a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated that IFN-γ and TNFα cooperatively recruited STAT1 and CBP-RNA polymerase II to the promoter region of the CXCL9 gene. These results indicate that CBP mediates the IFN-γ/STAT1 and TNFα/NF-κB-induced transcriptional synergy by recruiting the RNA polymerase II complex to the CXCL9 promoter via simultaneous interaction with STAT1 and NF-κB. Recombinant IFN-γ and TNFα were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies against STAT1, CBP, NF-κB p50, RelA (p65), and RNA polymerase II were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

After preclearing of the lysate, the whole cell lysate (∼500 μg of protein) was incubated with anti-V5 (1 μg) antibody or normal mouse IgG and protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry) for 16 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting.

Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), we wished to examine whether CBP mediated this STAT1- and NF-κB-dependent transcriptional synergy. For this purpose, we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of the CXCL9/MIG gene, an IFN-γ-inducible chemokine for activated T cells (13Farber J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5238-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 14Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell.

Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) known to be cooperatively regulated by IFN-γ and TNFα, although the mechanisms involved in this cooperation remain to be determined. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing 328 bp of a 5′-flanking sequence of the CXCL9 gene and an expression vector encoding CBP or empty vector. After transfection, the cells were stimulated with IFN-γ and/or TNFα or left untreated before analysis of the luciferase reporter gene activity. As shown in Fig. 1, although IFN-γ and TNFα alone had only a minimum effect on the CXCL9 promoter activity in the absence of CBP, costimulation with IFN-γ and TNFα synergistically induced the promoter activity. When the cells were cotransfected with the expression vector encoding CBP, the cooperative response to IFN-γ and TNFα was further potentiated. This result indicates that CBP functioned to mediate the synergy between IFN-γ and TNFα for the transcription of the CXCL9 gene. In previous studies, we and others showed that both a STAT1 binding element and NF-κB binding site were required for the IFN-γ- and TNFα-induced transcriptional synergy (4Jahnke A. Johnson J.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5235-5244PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ohmori Y. Schreiber R.D. Hamilton T.A. J.

There are several potential regulatory elements in the promoter region of the CXCL9 gene (Fig. 2 A). Although γRE has been identified as an IFN-γ-responsive site that is recognized by the STAT1 tetramer (14Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 31Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29202-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the functional significance of several putative κB sites within −200 bp of the promoter has not been analyzed. To determine the regulatory elements responsible for the CBP-mediated transcriptional synergy, we mutated the γRE and these putative κB sites and analyzed the mutant ones for their possible role in IFN-γ- and TNFα-induced promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 2 B, mutation of 5′-γRE or 3′-γRE abolished the cooperative response to IFN-γ and TNFα without affecting the TNFα-induced luciferase activity (lanes 3 and4). Whereas mutation of the κB1 site had little effect on the promoter activity (lane 5), mutation of the κB3 one diminished the cooperative response to IFN-γ and TNFα (lane 7). Furthermore, mutation of the κB2 site abolished the response to TNFα and markedly reduced the cooperativity for IFN-γ and TNFα (lane 6). Mutation of both the 3′-γRE and κB2 sites almost completely eliminated the sensitivity to both stimuli (lane 9). The requirement of the γRE and κB2 sites for mediating the IFN-γ- and TNFα- induced transcriptional synergy was also observed in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these results indicate that both the γRE and κB2 sites are required to mediate the transcriptional synergy of the CXCL9 gene. An EMSA study was carried out to examine the γRE and κB DNA binding activities in nuclear extracts from IFN-γ- and/or TNFα-stimulated cells. As seen in Fig. 3 A, IFN-γ induced formation of complex I and modestly increased the binding activity of complex II (lane 2), but co-stimulation with IFN-γ and TNFα did not enhance these DNA binding activities (lane 4). The antibody supershift assay demonstrated that complexes I and II contained STAT1 (Fig. 3 B,lane 8), which correspond to the previously identified γRF-1 and γRF-2, respectively (14Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 31Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29202-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Antibody to NF-κB1 (p50) and RelA (p65) also reduced the binding activity of complexes II and III (lanes 9–11), indicating that complexes II and III contained NF-κB1 (p50)/RelA (p65) and NF-κB1 (p50) homodimer, respectively. In this regard, NF-κB was previously reported to bind to the γRE of the CXCL9 gene as well as to the IFN-γ activation sequence of the IRF-1 gene (15Ohmori Y. Schreiber R.D. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14899-14907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 16Pine R.

In our EMSA study using the κB motifs from the promoter region of the CXCL9 gene as probes, a marked DNA binding activity was observed at the κB2 motif (Fig. 3 C, lanes 5–8), consistent with the result of the promoter analysis showing that mutation of the κB2 site significantly reduced the promoter activity (Fig. 2). When the cells were costimulated with IFN-γ and TNFα, the binding activity toward these κB motifs was unchanged (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4, 8, and12). The antibody supershift assay showed that NF-κB1 (p50)/RelA (p65) and NF-κB1 (p50) homodimer bound to the κB2 motif (Fig. 3 D). Thus, these results indicate that STAT1 and NF-κB had the ability to bind to these sites independently. Because STAT1 and NF-κB have been shown to interact with CBP independently (24Zhang J.J.

Both proteins appear to be involved in the regulation of cell growth and maturation, but the precise mechanisms are not yet well defined. Polycystin-2 has recently been shown to function as a Ca2+-permeable, non-selective cation channel. Polycystin-2 interacts through its cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal region with a coiled-coil motif in the cytoplasmic tail of polycystin-1 (P1CC). The functional consequences of this interaction on its channel activity, however, are unknown. In this report, we show that P1CC enhanced the channel activity of polycystin-2. R742X, a disease-causing polycystin-2 mutant lacking the polycystin-1 interacting region, fails to respond to P1CC. Also, P1CC containing a disease-causing mutation in its coiled-coil motif loses its stimulatory effect on wild-type polycystin-2 channel activity.

Here, we demonstrate that binding of polycystin-2 to the coiled-coil-containing segment of the polycystin-1 carboxyl-tail (P1CC) increased and stabilized polycystin-2 channel function. In contrast, a single point mutation in P1CC, Q4215P, abolished the regulatory role on wild-type polycystin-2 channel function. Furthermore, the polycystin-2 truncation mutant R742X, an active channel (15Chen X.Z. Segal Y. Basora N. Guo L. Peng J.B. Babakhanlou H. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Zhou J. Biochem.

The polycystin-1/-2 interaction reversed both spontaneous and voltage-induced inactivation of polycystin-2.

Functional interruption of this interaction may account for abnormalities in protein targeting, cell growth, and ion transport, characteristic of ADPKD.

The functional consequences of polycystin-1 interaction on polycystin-2 channel activity, however, have not been determined. Here, we demonstrate that binding of polycystin-2 to the coiled-coil-containing segment of the polycystin-1 carboxyl-tail (P1CC) increased and stabilized polycystin-2 channel function. In contrast, a single point mutation in P1CC, Q4215P, abolished the regulatory role on wild-type polycystin-2 channel function. Furthermore, the polycystin-2 truncation mutant R742X, an active channel (15Chen X.Z. Segal Y. Basora N. Guo L. Peng J.B. Babakhanlou H. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Zhou J. Biochem.

Proteins specifically associated with lipid droplets have only recently been described, and the amino acid sequences required to target nascent proteins to lipid droplets are uncharacterized. The purpose of this study is to identify the structural motifs responsible for directing the targeting of perilipins, the major proteins coating the prominent lipid droplets of adipocytes, to lipid droplets.Lipid droplets are spherical organelles found in many types of eukaryotic cells that are composed of a core of neutral lipids covered by a monolayer of phospholipids, free cholesterol, and proteins. Depending on the cell type, the number of lipid droplets, the relative mass of stored triacylglycerol and cholesterol esters, and the protein composition of the droplet vary. Adipocytes store almost exclusively triacylglycerol in enormous lipid droplets that may exceed 100 μm and constitute the major energy storage depot of the body. Many other cells store cholesterol ester in tiny droplets; this cholesterol is used to maintain cellular cholesterol levels for membrane synthesis, and, in specialized cells in the adrenal cortex, testes, and ovaries, it serves as a source of substrate for steroid hormone synthesis (4Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar).

Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Perilipins are synthesized on free ribosomes rather than on endoplasmic reticulum-bound ribosomes (16Brasaemle D.L.

Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar); thus, nascent perilipins must travel to and assemble onto lipid droplets post-translationally. The processes that control the directing of nascent proteins to lipid droplets and the assembly of these proteins onto the droplet have not been elucidated. The purpose of this study is to identify the structural domains that mediate the targeting and anchoring of perilipin A to lipid droplets. Deletion mutations of perilipin A were stably expressed in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, a cell line that does not express endogenous perilipins. Targeting of mutated perilipins to lipid droplets was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting of subcellular fractions; effective anchoring of the mutated proteins into the droplet was assayed by subjecting isolated lipid droplets to alkaline carbonate solutions, in a classic test for hydrophobic interactions. The studies show that the central 25% of perilipin A contains all of the amino acid sequences required to target and anchor the protein to lipid droplets.DISCUSSIONThe major finding of this study is that the central domain of perilipin A, representing 25% of the amino acid sequence, contains all of the sequences that are required to target the protein to lipid droplets. A portion of this region, comprising H1 through H2, is sufficient to redirect soluble GFP to lipid droplets. There appear to be redundancies among a combination of targeting signals within this central region. The removal of various small portions of the central region fails to eliminate the targeting of perilipin to lipid droplets, but removal of the entire sequence prevents targeting. Hence, we suggest that the signals required to target perilipin A to lipid droplets are a combination of hydrophobic domains in conjunction with the acidic domain. When these targeting domains are present within the entire protein, they are dispensable individually or in some combinations, but the presence of at least the sequence from H1 through H2 is sufficient to redirect GFP to lipid droplets, and the absence of the entire sequence from H1 through H3 is necessary to eliminate the targeting of perilipin A to lipid droplets. Thus, we conclude that perilipin A does not contain a single short amino acid “zip code” responsible for directing its targeting to lipid droplets.The domains mediating the anchoring of perilipin A to lipid droplets are similar to those responsible for targeting perilipins to lipid droplets. Results obtained from subjecting lipid droplets to alkaline carbonate solutions suggest that perilipin A associates with lipid droplets via hydrophobic interactions; this observation implies that the hydrophobic domains of perilipin may embed into the core of the lipid droplet to anchor the protein. Our results indicate that H3, in the absence of the sequence comprising H1 through H2, but in the context of the remaining amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences (mutation Δ4), is sufficient to mediate the targeting and anchoring of perilipin to lipid droplets, but results obtained with other mutations indicate that H3 is dispensable. However, if H3 and the remainder of the carboxyl terminus are deleted, then both H1 and H2 are necessary to tether the protein to the lipid droplets. It is likely that the context of the amino acids surrounding the hydrophobic domains plays a role in positioning the protein with respect to the droplet, and that the individual hydrophobic domains may not play equivalent roles in embedding the protein into the droplet. This idea gains support from the observation that perilipin mutation N5 targets to lipid droplets but fails to withstand the carbonate wash conditions despite the presence of three hydrophobic domains; in the absence of the adjacent amino acids, the positioning of this mutated protein at the surface of the droplets may be insufficient to support firm anchoring into the droplet.We hypothesize that perilipin A is anchored onto lipid droplets through the three hydrophobic domains, which embed into the neutral lipid-filled core, whereas the central highly charged acidic domain loops away from the surface of the lipid droplet. The sequences with the characteristics of amphipathic β-pleated sheets may be shallowly embedded into the surface phospholipids of the droplets; this positioning of the amino terminus may help perilipin A to serve its function of stabilizing the lipid droplet. Alternatively, these regions could be folded in upon themselves with the hydrophobic faces in close proximity, in which case the “globular” arrangement would limit the contact of the protein with the surface of the lipid droplet and may lead to a less stabilizing configuration. In our hypothetical model of perilipin association with lipid droplets, the extreme amino and carboxyl termini may be positioned near the surface of the lipid droplet, without being embedded. These sequences contain dispersed charged amino acids that might engage in interactions with other cellular proteins. Deletion of the carboxyl terminus or portions of the central domain leads to the dispersion of lipid droplets (Figs. 4 and5) that appear in a clustered arrangement when full-length perilipin A or amino-terminal deletion mutations (Fig. 3) are expressed; thus, residues within the carboxyl terminus and central domain may participate in interactions that promote the clustering of lipid droplets in one or two regions of the cytoplasm.TIP47 and adipophilin share a high degree of sequence similarity with the perilipins and, furthermore, like perilipins, target to and associate with lipid droplets, most likely through hydrophobic interactions, because the proteins resist removal by the extraction of lipid droplets with alkaline carbonate solutions. Although a recent study has questioned the association of TIP47 with lipid droplets (25Barbero, P., Buell, E., Zulley, S., and Pfeffer, S. R. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 24348–24351Google Scholar), further studies by Miura and co-workers (26Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32253-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and in our laboratory, 2D. L. Brasaemle, N. E. Wolins, and B. Rubin, unpublished data. have confirmed the localization of TIP47 to lipid droplets. To date, no studies have addressed the molecular basis of the targeting of TIP47 or adipophilin to lipid droplets. Surprisingly, the amino-terminal domain of 105 amino acids that is highly conserved within this family of proteins is not required to mediate the targeting of perilipin A to lipid droplets, thus suggesting that this domain may play another, as yet uncharacterized role in the function of these lipid droplet-associated proteins. Furthermore, the dispensability of the amino terminus of perilipin is remarkable in light of the observation that the earliest synthesized sequences in the amino termini of many different proteins contain essential targeting information. TIP47 and adipophilin are less highly conserved in the central sequences that target and anchor perilipins to lipid droplets. None of the members of this family of proteins contain extensive stretches of hydrophobic amino acids, although hydropathy plots of the proteins show short moderately hydrophobic sequences for all members. An alternative mechanism of anchoring these proteins to lipid droplets may be through the acylation of cysteine residues; Heid and co-workers (23Heid H.W. Schnolzer M. Keenan T.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have shown that adipophilin is likely acylated. Future studies are needed to determine the mechanism required to direct these additional family members to lipid droplets. A comparison of the sequences of TIP47 and adipophilin may also be instructive to explain some significant differences in the targeting behavior of TIP47 relative to the other family members; in addition to localizing to lipid droplets, TIP47 can be found in the cytosol of most cells (21Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 27Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R.

Finally, additional members of this protein family have been identified in Drosophila,Bombyx, and Dictyostelium (11Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); bothDrosophila proteins, as well as the Dictyosteliumprotein, target to lipid droplets when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells in culture (26Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32253-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).While perilipins, adipophilin, and TIP47 are naturally occurring lipid droplet-associated proteins, several additional proteins have recently been demonstrated to localize to lipid droplets under some conditions in laboratory experiments. Although caveolins normally associate with small invaginations along the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, ectopically expressed caveolins have been shown to localize to lipid droplets in cultured cells when plasma membrane targeting signals are deleted, endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signals are added, or when cells are treated with oleic acid or brefeldin A (31Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Ishiguro K. Tauchi K. Nomura R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 32Ostermeyer A.G. Paci J.M. Zeng Y. Lublin D.M. Munro S. Brown D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 33Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis experiments described in these studies suggest that caveolins associate with lipid droplets via a central hydrophobic domain. Additionally, when expressed in cultured cell lines, the core proteins of both the hepatitis C virus and the GB virus-B associate with lipid droplets via a central highly hydrophobic domain (34Hope R.G. Murphy D.J. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4261-4270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and localize to the cytoplasm and several other membranes within the cell. Thus, in all lipid droplet-associated proteins studied to date, hydrophobic domains have been implicated in targeting of the proteins to lipid droplets.Mutated perilipins that are not found on lipid droplets cannot be found in any other subcellular compartments and appear to be synthesized but rapidly degraded. Because perilipins are stabilized upon association with lipid droplets (16Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that the removal of essential targeting sequences produces mutated perilipins in the cytoplasm that fail to become stabilized by anchoring to lipid droplets and, hence, are rapidly degraded. Alternatively, the removal of specific sequences may either prohibit the proper folding of the mutated perilipins, leading to failure to target and subsequent degradation, or promote much slower synthesis or more rapid degradation of the mutated protein, thus eliminating subsequent targeting to droplets. Interestingly, although the removal of a few extra amino acids from an already truncated perilipin construct prevented targeting of the translated product and promoted degradation (as seen for mutated perilipins N6 and C7), the deletion of these few amino acids from otherwise intact perilipin had no effect on targeting or on the stability of the protein whatsoever (perilipin mutations Δ1 and Δ3); these observations suggest that the perilipin sequence lacks short segments that are required to prevent rapid degradation. The only mutated perilipins that failed to target lacked large portions of the protein sequence. Furthermore, the addition of oleic acid to the culture medium, which has been demonstrated to stabilize overexpressed perilipin A (16Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), failed to stabilize the non-targeting mutated perilipins. All proteins contain sequences of amino acids that specify their ultimate subcellular localization. These molecular zip codes may consist of a short motif such as the KDEL sequence that serves as a retention signal to hold proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (1Nilsson T. Warren G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Pelham H.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 250: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or may be quite complex like mitochondrial targeting signals that lack amino acid identity, but are enriched in hydrophobic, hydroxylated, and positively charged amino acids, and have the potential to form amphipathic α-helices (3Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Proteins specifically associated with lipid droplets have only recently been described, and the amino acid sequences required to target nascent proteins to lipid droplets are uncharacterized. The purpose of this study is to identify the structural motifs responsible for directing the targeting of perilipins, the major proteins coating the prominent lipid droplets of adipocytes, to lipid droplets. Lipid droplets are spherical organelles found in many types of eukaryotic cells that are composed of a core of neutral lipids covered by a monolayer of phospholipids, free cholesterol, and proteins. Depending on the cell type, the number of lipid droplets, the relative mass of stored triacylglycerol and cholesterol esters, and the protein composition of the droplet vary. Adipocytes store almost exclusively triacylglycerol in enormous lipid droplets that may exceed 100 μm and constitute the major energy storage depot of the body. Many other cells store cholesterol ester in tiny droplets; this cholesterol is used to maintain cellular cholesterol levels for membrane synthesis, and, in specialized cells in the adrenal cortex, testes, and ovaries, it serves as a source of substrate for steroid hormone synthesis (4Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). To date, few lipid droplet-associated proteins have been identified in mammals, yet recent functional studies show that these proteins serve essential roles in regulating neutral lipid storage and release (5Brasaemle D.L.

Here, we report that synaptically activated KARs presynaptically facilitate and depress transmission at parallel fiber synapses in the cerebellar cortex. Low-frequency stimulation of parallel fibers facilitates synapses onto both stellate cells and Purkinje cells, whereas high-frequency stimulation depresses stellate cell synapses but continues to facilitate Purkinje cell synapses. These effects are mimicked by exogenous KAR agonists and eliminated by blocking KARs. This differential frequency-dependent sensitivity of these two synapses regulates the balance of excitatory and inhibitory input to Purkinje cells and therefore their excitability."

DSBs usually occur in intergenic regions that display open chromatin accessibility, but other determinants that control their frequencies and non-random chromosomal distribution remain obscure. We report that a Spo11 construct bearing the Gal4 DNA binding domain not only rescues spo11Δ spore inviability and catalyzes DSB formation at natural sites but also strongly stimulates DSB formation near Gal4 binding sites. At GAL2, a naturally DSB-cold locus, Gal4BD-Spo11 creates a recombinational hotspot that depends on all the other DSB gene functions, showing that the targeting of Spo11 to a specific site is sufficient to stimulate meiotic recombination that is under normal physiological control."

These binding interactions presumably allow SecA to transfer polypeptide segments to SecYEG. However, the details of the preprotein binding and transfer reactions are not understood, so there is little information on how processivity is achieved in preprotein translocation. Achieving efficient processive translocation is likely to involve complex interactions between SecA and the preprotein. Experimental evidence for such complexity comes from studies on the interaction of synthetic signal sequence peptides with SecA in different states. The binding of such peptides inhibits the ATPase activity of a 64-kDa N-terminal fragment of SecA with elevated basal activity (19Triplett T.L. Sgrignoli A.R. Gao F.B. Yang Y.B. Tai P.C.

Lee B.C. Yun C.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, SecA can be labeled by lipids containing photoactivatable groups in their hydrocarbon moieties (31Eichler J. Brunner J. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2188-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,32van Voorst F. van der Does C. Brunner J. Driessen A.J. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12261-12268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) when such probes are incorporated into pure lipid vesicles, although experiments of this kind also indicate that SecA becomes shielded from such interactions when it binds to SecYEG (14Joly J.C.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12261-12268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SecA is believed to form a physiological dimer based on the preponderance of the dimeric form in hydrodynamic assays in vitro (33Shilton B. Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Koch M.H. Cusack S. Economou A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 34Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L.

The monomer-dimer equilibrium is sensitive to temperature and the ionic environment, and the dimer has a tendency to form higher order oligomers as protein concentration is increased (34Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,36Weinkauf S. Hunt J.F. Scheuring J. Henry L. Fak J. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of hydrodynamic data indicates that two different forms of the SecA dimer are present in solution under some circumstances, differing either in their conformation or in the nature of their intersubunit interface (34Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Different studies have come to differing conclusions regarding the oligomeric state of SecYEG in the active translocation complex, some supporting its functioning as a monomer (37Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but others supporting its functioning as a dimer (38Collinson I. Breyton C. Duong F. Tziatzios C.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The possibility that SecYEG has a different oligomeric organization from SecA, combined with the general complexity of the processive protein translocation reaction, has raised the possibility that SecA could change its oligomeric state during the functional translocation cycle (9Driessen A.J. Manting E.H. van der Does C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 34Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L.

Driessen A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, little evidence has been presented to support this possibility. The present work shows that phospholipid and signal peptide ligands alter the complex equilibria between monomeric and oligomeric forms of SecA, supporting the possibility that changes in the oligomeric state of SecA could play a functional role in the protein translocation reaction. KET buffer contains 50 mmKCl, 1.0 mm Na-EDTA, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6. Phospholipid analogues were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. Escherichia coli SecA variants were purified as described (41Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Strains overexpressing thePrlD suppressor mutants were obtained from D. B. Oliver of Wesleyan University. The KRR-LamB signal peptide (+H3N-MMITLRKRRKLPLAVAVAAGVMSAQAMA-COO−) and the Δ78 variant (+H3N-MMITLRKRRKLPVAAGVMSAQAMA-COO−) were synthesized and purified as described (13Wang Z. Jones J.D. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13991-13999Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The concentration of signal peptide in a concentrated stock solution in water was determined using quantitative amino acid analysis (conducted at the W. M. Keck Biopolymer Facility at Yale University). Some wild-type signal peptide preparations had a tendency to generate a precipitate when diluted into KET buffer, complicating fluorescence anisotropy measurements. However, these preparations produced equivalent redimerization of lyso-myristoylphosphatidylglycerol (lyso-MPG)1-bound SecA monomers in sedimentation velocity assays where the precipitate is rapidly cleared from the cell so that it does not interfere with quantitation. Excitation-corrected emission spectra were measured as described using 297 nm excitation (41Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Total fluorescence was monitored at 340 nm, whereas the anisotropy values were averaged in a window from 320 to 380 nm to improve the signal to noise ratio of the data. The anisotropy curves changed uniformly throughout this spectral region and showed no fine structure. Whereas background subtraction was generally performed using spectra collected from a pure buffer sample, a fluorescent contaminant in the dicaproyl phospholipid stocks required protein-free solutions at equivalent phospholipid concentrations to be used for background subtraction of samples containing concentrations of these species in excess of 1 mm (i.e. for the fluorescence experiments summarized in Table II).Table IIEfficacy of different detergent species in inducing monomerization of SecAPhospholipid/detergentSecA monomerizationApparent cooperativity[Detergent]1/2Detergent CMCLyso-lauryl-PC+7.7660 μm750 μmLyso-myristoyl-PC+3.6 72 μm 68 μmLyso-palmitoyl-PC+4.0 34 μm 12 μmLyso-myristoyl-PG+3.3 62 μm 64 μmDicaproyl-PC−2-aSome degree of SecA tetramer formation was observed in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments conducted in the presence of concentrations of DCPC above its CMC. 22 mmDicaproyl-PG− 24 mmβ-Octylglucoside−2-bIn both fluorescence and ultracentrifugation experiments, SecA showed a pronounced tendency to aggregate in the presence of β-octylglucoside concentrations above its CMC; protein aggregation could potentially have prevented the observation of SecA monomers in these experiments. 32 mmβ-Dodecylmaltoside−100 μmC12E8− 39 μmLauryldimethylamineoxide+5.91.5 mm1.9 mmThe monomerization of SecA was assayed at 24 °C in KET buffer using fluorescence anisotropy titrations equivalent to those shown in Fig. 1 C (terminating at a phospholipid or detergent concentration above the CMC), and the results were verified using sedimentation velocity experiments equivalent to those reported in Table I.

The CMC values were determined in KET bufferin situ in the fluorimeter for all of the detergent and phospholipid species reported here (as described under “Materials and Methods”). Detergent CMCs were determined using in situ elastic light-scattering measurements in the fluorimeter. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 297 and 298 nm, respectively, and the excitation-corrected 90° light scattering signal was measured as a function of detergent concentration (in KET buffer) using vertical excitation and emission polarizers with a 30-s averaging time for digital photon-counting and 4-nm slits. Linear regressions were used to fit the pre- and post-CMC regions in the plot of light scattering versus detergent concentration, and the CMC was calculated as the point at which these curves intersect. The molecular masses of the lyso-MPG and lyso-myristoylphosphatidylcholine (lyso-MPC) micelles in KET buffer were determined to be 35 and 65 kDa, respectively, from static light scattering and refractive index measurements performed using Dawn EOS and Optilab detectors (Wyatt Inc., Santa Barbara, CA). The details of these experiments will be published elsewhere. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20 °C in KET buffer in a Beckman XL-A centrifuge using an 8-slot rotor at 20,000 rpm. Double-sector Epon centerpieces were used with 420 μl in the sample cell and 440 μl of buffer in the reference cell. Absorbance measurements at 280 nm were taken in 0.002-cm radial steps. Absorbance and refractive index scans were measured from each cell every 8 min over the course of 14 h. Absorbance data were analyzed with the program SEDFIT using the continuous distribution c(S) and c(M) Lamm equation model (42Schuck P. Biophys.

The partial specific volume of the protein was assumed to be 0.734 ml/g, and the density of the solvent was calculated to be 0.998148 g/ml (44Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L.

An ensemble of ∼90 scans was used for the final refinement of each c(M) distribution plot. The meniscus was identified by manual inspection and refined during fitting, and the data range was truncated near the bottom of the plateau region in the ensemble of sedimentation curves. The value of the frictional ratiof/f 0 was initially assumed to be 1.2 and refined by the program (Table I). S values between ∼0.5 and ∼18 were considered and divided into 1000 steps. Maximum entropy regularization was used assuming a confidence level of 0.9.

The first value represents the partial specific volume of the protein, whereas the second value represents an upper limit for the partial specific volume of the lyso-MPC and lyso-MPG micelles given the fact that they are more dense than D2O buffer (as evidenced by their observed sedimentation rather than floatation in this environment). The resulting plot of molecular mass versusthe assumed partial specific volume of the hydrodynamic particle was empirically fit to a third order polynomial. This equation was used to calculate the total molecular mass of the particle for any given value of its overall partial specific volume (V̄ overall), as calculated from the assumed values for the phospholipid-to-protein mass ratio in the complex (R) and the partial specific volume of the phospholipid (V̄ PL), as shown in Equation 1. V̄overall=(R·V̄PL+0.734)/(R+1)Equation 1 The molecular mass of the protein in the complex was then calculated based on the assumed phospholipid-to-protein mass ratio, yielding data of the kind shown in Fig. 1 C. 50 μm (20 °C) or 46 μm (37 °C) SecA (monomer concentration) was preincubated for 10 min in cross-linking buffer (10 mm KCl, 20 mm MgOAc2, 50 mmtriethanolamine, pH 7.5) with signal peptides (at a 100 μm concentration) and/or phospholipids (at a 2 mm concentration). Cross-linking was initiated by the addition of 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 5 (20 °C) or 3 (37 °C) min and stopped by adding 2× SDS gel loading buffer and boiling for 3 min. Cross-linked proteins were analyzed by 4% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 1, A–C), fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 1 D), and glutaraldehyde cross-linking (Fig. 2 A) experiments show that the physiological dimer of SecA is monomerized by the long-chain phospholipid analogues lyso-MPG or lyso-MPC. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments (Fig. 1 D) show that SecA remains a dimer in the presence of equivalent concentrations of short-chain phospholipid analogues with the same head group structures (dicaproylphosphatidylglycerol (DCPG) and dicaproylphosphatidylcholine (DCPC)). Absorbance scans from sedimentation velocity experiments conducted either in the absence or presence of 150 μm lyso-MPG (Fig. 1 A) show an obvious reduction in the sedimentation coefficient of SecA in the presence of this phospholipid analogue. The program SEDFIT was used to fit these data and data from an equivalent experiment conducted in the presence of 150 μmlyso-MPC using the continuous distribution c(S) and c(M) Lamm equation model (42Schuck P.

https://openalex.org/W2147148702,"As an approach toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of neuronal differentiation, we utilized DNA microarrays to elucidate global patterns of gene expression during pontocerebellar development. Through this analysis, we identified groups of genes specific to neuronal precursor cells, associated with axon outgrowth, and regulated in response to contact with synaptic target cells. In the cerebellum, we identified a phase of granule cell differentiation that is independent of interactions with other cerebellar cell types. Analysis of pontine gene expression revealed that distinct programs of gene expression, correlated with axon outgrowth and synapse formation, can be decoupled and are likely influenced by different cells in the cerebellar target environment. Our approach provides insight into the genetic programs underlying the differentiation of specific cell types in the pontocerebellar projection system."

In an attempt to discover what regulatory pathways are utilized by osteoblasts to effect this site-specific formation event we probed components of an active bone resorption surface with an osteoblast phage expression library. In these experiments primary cultures of rat osteoblasts were used to construct a phage display library in T7 phage. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (type V) (TRAP) was used as the bait in a biopanning procedure. 40 phage clones with very high affinity for TRAP were sequenced, and of the clones with multiple consensus sequences we identified a regulatory protein that modulates osteoblast differentiation. This protein is the TGFβ receptor-interacting protein (TRIP-1). Our data demonstrate that TRAP activation of TRIP-1 evokes a TGFβ-like differentiation process. Specifically, TRIP-1 activation increases the activity and expression of osteoblast alkaline phosphatase, osteoprotegerin, collagen, and Runx2. Moreover, we show that TRAP interacts with TRIP intracellularly, that activation of the TGFβ type II receptor by TRIP-1 occurs in the presence of TRAP and that the differentiation process is mediated through the Smad2/3 pathway. A final experiment demonstrates that osteoblasts, when cultured in osteoclast lacunae containing TRAP, rapidly and specifically differentiate into a mature bone-forming phenotype.

As there are 1–2 million active remodeling sites in an adult skeleton at any point in time (1Parfitt A.M. Recker R.R. Bone Histomorphometry: Techniques and Interpretation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1983: 143-223Google Scholar), this spatial localization of formation plays a key role in maintaining skeletal architecture. Aberrant or disorganized formation could lead to architectural changes that would weaken skeletal structure. The observation that osteoclastic bone resorption precedes osteoblastic bone formation has been a well known characteristic of the cell activity in the basal metabolic unit (BMU) described by Frost (2Frost H.M. J. Bone Joint Surg. 1966; 48: 1192-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), nearly 40 years ago. In a BMU, osteoclastic activation is followed by a reversal phase in which the osteoclast either migrates to another bony site or dies by apoptosis. Osteoblast bone formation then proceeds directly on the reversal line and if the two activities are matched in amount, a constant skeletal mass is preserved. Activation of osteoprogenitor cells in the immediate area of a resorption event has been attributed to the release of growth factors from the bone during osteoclast activity. This process, first termed coupling by Harris and Heany in 1969 (3Harris W.H. Heaney R.P. N. Eng. J. Med. 1969; 280: 253-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Harris W.H. Heaney R.P. N. Eng. J. Med. 1969; 280: 303-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), accounts for the temporal sequence of resorption preceding formation. However, what has not been appreciated is that the formation occurs at the immediate sites were osteoclast activity occurred. In work performed by Gray, Jones, and Boyde (5Jones S.J. Gray C. Boyde A. Anat. Embryol. 1994; 190: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Gray C. Boyde A. Jones S.J. Bone. 1996; 18: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) it was shown that osteoblasts produce more mineralized matrix at sites of prior resorption and in geometrical grooves created on bone and dentin wafers. The authors suggest that this may be one signaling mechanism by with these cells “even off” the contours of bone resorption lacunae. It also appears that surface roughness on implants may stimulate bone formation (7Schwartz Z. Lohmann C.H. Vocke A.K. Sylvia V.L. Cochran D.L. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. J. Biomed. Mat. Res. 2001; 56: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Boyan B.D. Lohmann C.H. Sisk M. Liu Y. Sylvia V.L. Cochran D.L. Dean D.D. Schwartz Z. J. Biomed. Mat.

Dental Res. 1999; 13: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, since there are numerous contours that persist in trabecular bone structure, it is unlikely that surface geometry is the only driving factor in directing bone formation. We speculate that biochemical signals deposited on resorption lacunae by osteoclasts may play a major role in directing the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells into a mature osteoblast phenotype. In order to explore this hypothesis, we utilized an osteoblast cDNA phage-display library in T7 phage to probe one of the components of the lacunar surface, namely type V tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP).1 TRAP is an acid hydrolase with optimum activity on phosphoester bonds at pH values below 6.0. TRAP is produced in large amounts by osteoclasts and is a hallmark of their activity (11Hayman A.R. Bune A.J. Cox T.M. J. Anat. 2000; 196: 433-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tiffee J.C.

For many years we have known that TRAP remains firmly attached to resorption surfaces and that bone formation can proceed directly on a TRAP-coated lacunae (13Baron R. Neff L. Brown W. Courtoy P.J.

As we show in this study, an osteoblast protein (TGFβ receptor-interacting protein, TRIP-1) possess very high affinity for TRAP and is poised for activating the TGFβ differentiation pathway in osteoblasts. TRIP-1 has been previously described in other cell types and has been shown to modulate TGFβ signaling in both a stimulatory and inhibitory fashion (16Choy L. Derynck R. J. Biol.

Purified type V TRAP was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. R. M. Roberts, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri. This enzyme, also known as uteroferrin, shares identity with osteoclast TRAP (24Ling P. Roberts R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6896-6902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical bone wafers were obtained by cutting 4.0 × 4.0 × 0.3 mm sections from bovine femoral cortical bone obtained from a local abattoir. Isolated osteoblasts were prepared from neonatal rat calvaria as previously described (25Martinez D.A. Zuscik M.J. Ishibe M. Rosier R.N. Romano P.R. Cushing J.E. Puzas J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase assays and standard Western analyses were performed as previously described (26Ionescu A.M. Schwarz E.M.

A T7 phage display library of rat osteoblast cDNAs was constructed from an existing primary rat osteoblast day 8 cDNA plasmid library generated from primary isolated rat osteoblasts. The cDNA inserts of the plasmid library were excised by digestion withEcoRI and NotI and inserted between the corresponding sites of an equimolar mixture of T7Select 1-1 vector arms (T7Select System Manual, Novagen). The resulting phage library contained 5.6 × 107 independent clones/ml, as determined by plaque assays. The library was amplified once by infecting a mid-log phase Escherichia coli (BLT 5615 bacterial strain) culture (250 ml, OD600 ∼0.6) with the phage library at a multiplicity of infection of 0.001. After cell lysis, the phage lysate was made in 0.5 m NaCl, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C. The insert sizes of 24 individual clones as well as of the complete library were analyzed by PCR with the forward primer 5′-GGAGCTGTCGTATTCCAGTC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AACCCCTCAAGACCCGTTTA-3′. An aliquot of the amplified phages (109 pfu) were allowed to bind to TRAP, which was immobilized on an ELISA plate for 2 h while rotating gently. Unbound phages were removed by washing ten times with 0.2 ml of 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.2, further washed twice in 0.2 ml of PBS, and finally resuspended in 100 μl of elution buffer (Novagen). Ten microliters of the supernatant was used to determine the amount of detached phage in each round of selection. The remaining 90 μl of the supernatant was added to a 10-ml culture (OD, 0.6) of E. coli (BLT5615). The bacteria had been induced with 100 μl of 100 mm IPTG 30 min before phage addition, to ensure production of the phage capsid protein. Approximately 2 h after phage addition the bacteria were lysed, and the phage sublibrary was added to the ELISA plate (Nunc, Rochester, NY) coated with TRAP. After binding and washing of the sublibrary, a new round of selection was started. Following two rounds of selection, 40 plaques were arbitrarily isolated from LB plates and each dissolved in phage extraction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 6 mm MgSO4). In order to disrupt the phages, the dissolved material was mixed 1:1 with 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and heated at 65 °C for 10 min. The phage DNA was then amplified by PCR, using T7 SelectUP and T7 SelectDOWN primers (T7Select Cloning kit, Novagen). After amplification, the PCR fragments were purified by adding 1 ml of 100% ETOH to precipitate the PCR product. The purified PCR fragments were then sequenced using ABI 377 Big Dye autosequence kit (Applied bioscience). Based on the sequence results, the predicted amino acid sequence displayed on the T7 phage capsid can be determined. The candidate clones were amplified and used to check the affinity to TRAP with an ELISA method. Small-scale phage preparations, obtained from single colonies of the third round of affinity biopanning were analyzed for binding to TRAP by phage ELISA. Briefly, in this method, selected phage at increasing titers were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in TRAP- or BSA-coated wells. Phage that bound to immobilized TRAP were detected by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 antibody (Novagen), followed by incubation with HRP substrate (ABTS Sigma A1888). The absorbance was read at an OD of 410 nm. A Far-Western technique was used to document that the selected phage were indeed binding to TRAP. In this procedure, two concentrations of TRAP and control proteins (bovine serum albumin, 5 ug) were loaded in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoresed. They were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated with 1010 M13 phage particles from a GPC4 phage (Clone 5), which have been shown to have high affinity and high specificity for TRAP (27Sheu T.J. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Rosier R.N. Puzas J.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The membrane was washed in PBS with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 four times. An anti-M13 phage peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:15000 was added and gently swirled at room temperature for 1 h. In the last washing procedure, the membrane was incubated in PBS without Tween 20. Detection of the phage/antibody complex was accomplished using ECL-plus (Amersham Biosciences) with the membrane exposed to Kodak Biomax MR film for 30 s. ELISA plates were coated by overnight incubation with 0.1 ml of carbonate buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mmNaHCO3, 0.02% NaN3, pH 9.6) containing 1 μg/ml of anti-OPG antibody at 4 °C per well. The plates were blocked with 0.2 ml of 5% dry milk in PBS per well for 1 h at 37 °C. 200 μl of medium prepared from different treatment cells as described above were added and incubated for 1h at 37 °C. Samples and serial dilution of OPG standards were loaded in triplicate to the plates (0.2 ml/well). After washing with PBS-Tween (0.1%), the bound OPG was quantified by successive incubation with another detection antibody conjugated with biotin (1 h each at 37 °C). After incubation, the plate was washed with PBS-Tween ten times and incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin with HRP-conjugated (1:10000 dilution from stock) for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, the plates were washed with PBS-Tween. 0.2 ml of 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid) solution (ABTS Sigma A1888) per well was added for reaction with horseradish peroxidase. The plate was then read at 405 nm in an ELISA reader. GST-TRAP and GST-TRIP fusion proteins, and GST control protein were purified as instructed by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, plasmids containing GST fusion protein expressing cDNA were transformed into a BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria strain and selected for ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant colonies. Selected colonies were grown in LB medium at 30 °C until the OD600 reached 0.6–1. Then 0.1 mm IPTG was added to the medium for 3 h. Bacteria were lysed by B-PER (Pierce) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysed bacteria were spun down and the supernatants were collected. The GST fusion proteins were pulled down by glutathione-coated beads (AmershamBiosciences) in 4 °C for 1 h then washed three times with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The purified GST fusion proteins and beads were suspended in 100 μl of NETN buffer. Resuspended GST proteins and beads were incubated with 5 μg of purified TRAP or radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer-lysed transfected cell lysate. After incubating for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation, the glutathione-coated beads were washed with NETN buffer four times, and then the protein complexes were loaded in SDS-PAGE and visualized using the ECL-plus method. Transfections were performed using the Panver LT-1 reagent method (Panvera) as described in the product sheet. Briefly, 1.5–3 × 105 cells were plated on 35-mm dishes for 24 h, and the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum 2 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of plasmids expressing a Gal4-DBD (DNA binding domain) fused with a full-length TRIP-1 cDNA or an antisense TRIP-1 cDNA and a VP-16AD (activation domain) fused with a TRAP cDNA as indicated. A Gal4 response element controlled firefly luciferase expression plasmid, pG5-Luc, was used as reporter gene. A Renilla luciferase expression plasmid pRL-SV40 was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 5 μg with pCMX vectors. All data are presented as the mean ± 1 S.E. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. Osteoblast differentiation at sites of bone remodeling is mediated by a number of regulatory factors. One of the key factors is TGFβ. In most systems, ours included, TGFβ is known to be a potent enhancer of the osteoblast phenotype (22Harris S.E. Bonewald L.F. Harris M.A. Sabatini M. Dallas S,. Feng J.Q. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Wozney J. Mundy G.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 23Bonewald L.F. Schwartz Z. Swain L.D. Boyan B.D. Bone Miner. 1992; 17: 139-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fig. 1shows that in the presence of TGFβ isolated osteoblasts show an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and an increase in Runx 2, OPG, and collagen protein synthesis. In an exactly analogous fashion, TRAP demonstrates the same effect. Control phosphatases such as myokinase and ATPase have no effect on the cells (data not shown). The effect of TRAP on osteoblasts may be one mechanism by which the cells are induced to differentiate only at sites of prior bone resorption. In order to define what osteoblast proteins may be involved in this mechanism we probed immobilized TRAP with T7 phage that were expressing proteins from an osteoblast cDNA library. After three rounds of biopanning 40 phage clones with very high affinity for TRAP were sequenced and analyzed. Three of the clones contained sequences that may be involved in osteoblast differentiation. They were type I collagen, Sox9, and TRIP-1. However, the sequences for type I collagen and Sox9 were from the 3′-untranslated region of the messages. The TRIP-1 sequence, however, was from the coding region of the protein. Fig. 2 A demonstrates that the TRIP-1-expressing phage show a dose-dependent affinity for TRAP. Fig. 2 B is a compilation of data that indicate the binding of TRIP-1 to TRAP is specific and of high affinity. For these experiments we prepared a plasmid construct with human TRIP-1 cDNA fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-TRIP). As a control protein we utilized the GST vector alone. GST-TRIP and TRAP were incubated for 1 h, and any proteins associated with the GST-TRIP were extracted from the reaction mixture by incubation with glutathione-coated beads. The proteins were analyzed by Far-Western analysis utilizing a phage clone with high affinity for TRAP (27Sheu T.J. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Rosier R.N. Puzas J.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Inlane A of Fig. 2 B we show that the control fusion protein does not have any affinity for TRAP as no TRAP protein can be detected. Lane B demonstrates that the GST-TRIP fusion protein has no affinity for any of the components of bovine serum albumin and is not recognized in the Far-Western. Lanes Cand D show that GST-TRIP has a dose-dependent affinity for TRAP. Lane E is a positive control without glutathione bead extraction, demonstrating that TRAP can be detected in this Far-Western. These data document the affinity of TRIP-1 for TRAP and prove that the association does not depend on post-translational modifications of TRIP-1 as the protein was produced in bacteria and that the human sequence of TRIP has affinity for TRAP in the same way as the molecule from the rat cDNA library. In order to demonstrate that TRIP-1 and TRAP can interact inside of cells we utilized a mammalian two hybrid system. In these experiments we transfected 293T cells with fusion proteins composed of TRIP-1 with a Gal4-DNA binding domain (DBD) and TRAP with a VP-16-activation domain along with a luciferase reporter gene. Single transfections with either fusion protein showed no increase in reporter activity; however, co-transfection with both fusion proteins showed a 20-fold increase in reporter activity (Fig. 3). Moreover, in a control experiment where antisense TRIP-1 was substituted in the Gal4-DNA binding domain, there was also no stimulation of the reporter gene. These data demonstrate that TRIP-1 and TRAP can interact with each other in a highly specific manner in the cytosol of cells. As a further confirmation that TRAP and TRIP-1 interact in the same cell compartment we performed fluorescent labeling co-localization studies. 293T cells were transfected with TRIP-1 tagged with red fluorescent protein (TRIP-RFP) and TRAP tagged with a green fluorescent protein (TRAP-GFP). The cells were examined for TRAP-GFP and TRIP-RFP under fluorescence confocal microscopy. The images from the two wavelengths were digitally superimposed and where red and green pixels overlapped we created a merged pseudo-color image. This image demonstrates that at the resolution of the microscope and digital image, TRAP and TRIP-1 co-localize inside of cells (Fig. 4).Figure 4Co-localization of TRAP with TRIP-1 in 293T cells. TRAP and TRIP-1 were synthesized as a green fluorescent fusion protein (GFP) and red fluorescent fusion protein (RFP), respectively. When 293T cells were co-transfected with TRAP-GFP and TRIP-1-RFP and analyzed with dual wavelength confocal microscopy and digital imaging, it was possible to demonstrate co-localization of TRAP and TRIP-1. Digital images of cells at each wavelength were superimposed and where green and red pixels overlapped we created a pseudo-color yellow image. This experiment was performed three separate times. In each experiment over 100 cells were observed and all of them demonstrated some level of co-localization. The image in this figure represents a single cell. The bar indicates a distance of 20 microns.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next sought to determine if TRAP could activate one of the TGFβ signaling pathways. The data in Fig. 5show that both TGFβ and TRAP can strongly upregulate a reporter gene (P3TP-Lux) that is sensitive to the TGFβ regulatory Smads 2 and 3. The effects of TGFβ and TRAP are additive. As TRIP-1 is known to interact with the type II TGFβ receptor we investigated whether TRAP activation of this pathway could be blocked in the presence of a dominant negative type II TGFβ receptor expression vector. Fig. 5also demonstrates that in cells that have been co-transfected with a dominant negative type II TGFβ receptor we can block both TGFβ and TRAP activation of the pathway. These results were obtained with both osteoblast cell lines, MG-63 and SaOS2. The data with the MG-63 cell is what is shown. When these experiments were repeated in a Smad4-deficient cell type (SW408 cells), neither TGFβ nor TRAP could activate the reporter gene (Fig. 6). As Smad 4 is a requisite co-factor for Smad 2 and 3 signaling, these results are consistent with TRAP working through the Smad pathway. Restoration of Smad4 and TRIP-1 protein in these cells, restores TGFβ and TRAP signaling (Fig. 6). Thus, all of these pieces of evidence point to the activation of the TGFβ/Smad pathway through the association of TRAP with TRIP-1. We also have direct evidence that TRIP-1 will interact with the type II TGFβ receptor (TGFβRII) when TRAP is present in the cytosol. These data are presented in Fig. 7. These experiments utilized a His-tagged TRIP-1 (His-TRIP) and a GST-tagged TRAP (GST-TRAP). Detection of His-TRIP was performed with anti-His antibodies and detection of the TGFβRII and Smad 2 were performed with commercially available antibodies. For these studies, all cells were transfected with the TGFβRII. In the first experiment we co-transfected these cells with His-TRIP for 18 h, and then exposed them to exogenously added GST-TRAP for 12 h. The cells were lysed and the lysate incubated with glutathione beads. The beads were extensively washed, and the proteins interacting with the beads were analyzed with Western analysis. Fig. 7 demonstrates that if the cells were not exposed to GST-TRAP (column A) or they were not co-transfected with His-TRIP (column C) neither TRIP, TGFβRII, nor Smad 2 can be detected. However, when both His-TRIP and GST-TRAP were present the complex of the TGFβRII, His-TRIP, and Smad 2 was be extracted and detected (column B). These data provide evidence that in osteoblasts exogenously added TRAP can interact with cytosolic TRIP and that this complex associates with the type II TGFβ receptor and Smad 2. As a final test for the ability of osteoblasts to differentiate within osteoclast lacunae containing TRAP, we cultured osteoblasts on cortical bovine bone wafers on which we had previously created resorption lacunae with authentic osteoclasts. The lacunae have been shown to contain substantial amounts of TRAP (27Sheu T.J. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Rosier R.N. Puzas J.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After 7–10 days of culture, only osteoblasts residing within the lacunae had differentiated to the point of producing histochemically detectable alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 8). This model effectively recapitulates the bone remodeling process in vitro and verifies that osteoblasts can express a more differentiated phenotype when exposed to molecules within osteoclast lacunae. Maintenance of trabecular bone architecture is necessary to withstand mechanical forces and stresses and to resist skeletal fractures. Mechanical properties of bone (reviewed in Ref. 28Bikle D.D. Halloran B.P. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 1999; 17: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), microcracks (29Hirano T. Turner C.H. Forwood M.R. Johnston C.C. Burr D.B. Bone. 2000; 27: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), endocrine regulators (reviewed in Ref. 30Seeman E. Delmas P.D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 281-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and remodeling events are all likely factors involved in controlling the amount of bone at any particular skeletal site. In the present work we provide evidence that a non-traditional paracrine factor (i.e. TRAP) can act as a differentiating agent for osteoblasts. Moreover, TRAP appears to participate in the spatial orientation of where bone is formed during skeletal remodeling. Our data demonstrate that the type V osteoclast tartrate resistant acid phosphatase can activate the TGFβ signaling pathway in osteoblasts to enhance their differentiation. The interaction between TRAP and a previously described, but not well characterized molecule, TRIP-1, allows for activation of Smad signaling through the type II TGFβ receptor. We show that exogenous TRAP can bind to TRIP-1 with high affinity in the cytosol of osteoblasts. This complex then induces the cells to differentiate into a more mature phenotype. As TRAP is present in high concentrations on the surface of resorption lacunae, this may be one mechanism by which bone formation can be directed to sites of prior osteoclastic activity. Thus, we hypothesize that TRAP participates in the spatial control of trabecular bone architecture. The experiments reported under “Results” were performed with two sources of TRAP. One was from a purified protein extraction. This molecule would presumably be modified by post translational reactions. The second source of TRAP was material we created as a GST fusion protein. Both sources of TRAP behaved similarly in our binding and activity assays. This finding argues that it is likely to be a specific amino acid sequence in the TRAP molecule that binds to TRIP-1 rather than a post-translationally added carbohydrate moiety. The idea of a site-directing mechanism for cell differentiation is not a new concept. A number of properties of an extracellular matrix have been implicated in controlling cell function. Molecules such as fibronectin, osteopontin, laminin, the selectins and others have long been recognized in controlling cell activity. However, TRAP, would be considered a novel molecule in this regard because of its lysosomal nature and its site-specific selectivity in bone. Nevertheless, TRAP is perfectly positioned for this purpose. A hallmark of osteoclast bone resorption is the creation of a resorption space between the cell and the bone surface. Protons are actively pumped into this compartment along with a varied list of lysosomal enzymes. The low pH is responsible for mineral dissolution and the enzymes are responsible for collagen degradation. Some investigators have likened this compartment to an extracellular lysosome. However, when the osteoclast migrates to another site or undergoes apoptosis, the return of pH to physiological levels within the lacunae inactivates the enzymes and stops mineral mobilization. Yet the enzymes remain adhered to the surface of the resorption lacuna. Our findings suggest that one of these enzymes, TRAP, may participate in subsequent bone formation. TRIP-1 has been characterized as a modulator of the TGFβ response (16Choy L. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31455-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is a WD40 repeat-containing protein that is a phosphorylation substrate for the type II TGFβ receptor. TRIP-1, when phosphorylated, represses TGFβ-driven reporter activity from the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter but has no effect on the TGFβ-driven cyclin A promoter (16Choy L. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31455-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that when TRAP associates with TRIP-1, there is an activation of TGFβ signaling. Although the mechanistic pathway by which this occurs is not known at this time, it is possible that the TRAP/TRIP-1 association may block phosphorylation and allow a full expression of the TGFβ signaling pathway. TRIP-1 homologs have also been identified in plants. Their function in these systems is not known, however, speculation that they may be involved in cell cycle activity is supported by their similarity to a translation initiation factor (31Jiang J. Clouse S.D. Plant J. 2001; 26: 35-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of TRAP in skeletal cell signaling is a novel concept. We have known for a number of years that mice deficient in osteoclast TRAP demonstrate skeletal abnormalities (32Hayman A.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Foster D. Colledge W.H. Carlton M.B. Evans M.J. Cox T.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3151-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, TRAP-null mice have a compromised ability to resorb bone through defective osteoclast activity. This is manifested as a mild osteopetrosis, i.e.skeletal density is slightly increased. However, a closer examination of the bone reveals a haphazard and disorganized microarchitecture. This is exactly what would be predicted if osteoblastic bone formation was not targeted to sites of prior bone resorption. Additional evidence that removal of TRAP and other site-directing signals leads to inappropriate bone formation has been found at sites of inflammation and infection in bone, such as in periodontal disease (33Romano P.R. Caton J.G. Puzas J.E. J. Periodontal Res. 1997; 32: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Bacterial and inflammatory cell activity at alveolar bone sites could very well destroy site-directing signals and prevent normal osteoblast function. Thus, in summary, our data support the concept that specific signals are involved in directing bone formation during the remodeling process and that these signals may be molecules deposited by osteoclasts. Disruption of the site-directing signal would lead to a disorganized type of bone cell activity. We thank Janet Cushing for technical support and Dr. R. H. Chen for providing the TRIP-1 plasmids."

In humans, rabbits, and other species, GHBP derives from proteolytic shedding of the GH receptor (GHR) extracellular domain.

This process is sensitive to metalloprotease inhibition, and genetic reconstitution studies identify tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM-17), a transmembrane metalloprotease, as a GHR sheddase.

The N-terminal sequence,239FTCEEDFR246, matched perfectly the rbGHR and suggests that cleavage occurs eight residues from the membrane in the proximal extracellular domain stem region. Deletion and alanine substitution mutagenesis indicated that, similar to other TACE substrates, the spacing of residues in this region, more than their identity, influences GHR cleavage susceptibility. Further, we determined that PMA pretreatment desensitized a cleavage-sensitive GHR mutant, but not a cleavage-insensitive mutant, to GH-induced JAK2 activation.

A substantial fraction (roughly one-half in humans) of circulating GH is bound to a high-affinity GH-binding protein (GHBP), which corresponds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the GHR (5Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachianes G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C. Henzel W.J. Barnard R. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. Nature. 1987; 330: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar,6Baumann G. Amburn K. Shaw M.A. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Depending on species, GHBP is generated by two distinct mechanisms. In rodents, alternative splicing of the GHR mRNA yields a secreted form that includes the extracellular domain (7Baumbach W.R. Horner D.L. Logan J.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 8Smith W.C. Kuniyoshi J. Talamantes F. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In humans, rabbits, and other species, GHBP is derived by proteolysis of the GHR (reviewed in Ref. 10Baumann G. J. Ped. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 14: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This yields a soluble receptor extracellular domain in a process termed proteolytic GHBP shedding. An obligatory byproduct of proteolytic GHBP shedding is the so-called GHR “remnant”, a cytoplasmic domain-containing cell-associated fragment of the receptor that remains after the extracellular domain is shed (11Alele J.

We have previously shown in cell culture model systems that GHR proteolysis (receptor loss, remnant accumulation, and variable degrees of GHBP shedding) can be induced by several stimuli: 1) pharmacologic activation of protein kinase C by the phorbol ester, PMA; 2) treatment with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF); or 3) treatment of serum-starved cells with serum (11Alele J.

In each case, the inducible proteolysis is blocked by a metalloprotease inhibitor, and genetic reconstitution studies suggest that tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE, also known as ADAM-17, Refs. 15Black R.A.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4342-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In cells expressing either murine or rabbit (rb) GHRs, receptor proteolysis is accompanied by a decrease in the ability of subsequent stimulation with GH to elicit JAK2 activation, suggesting that metalloprotease-mediated heterologous desensitization may be a mechanism that impacts cellular responsiveness to GH (12Guan R. Zhang Y. Jiang J. Baumann C.A. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Conversely, prior treatment with GH, but not with a GH antagonist, renders cells resistant to inducible GHR proteolysis (13Zhang Y. Guan R. Jiang J. Kopchick J.J. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24565-24573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This suggests that GH-induced receptor dimerization or a GH-induced conformational change in the receptor's extracellular dimerization domain and/or stem region may impede access to the cleaving enzyme. In this study, we examined GHR extracellular domain determinants for metalloprotease-mediated proteolysis. Using adenoviral infection to accomplish abundant receptor expression, we identified a cleavage site in the rbGHR juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain. We tested the importance of the identity of this site in allowing receptor proteolysis to occur by performing mutagenesis experiments. Finally, by comparing cleavage-sensitive versus cleavage-resistant GHR mutants, we tested the effect of inducible receptor proteolysis on GH-induced signaling. PMA and routine reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. unless otherwise noted. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Recombinant hGH was kindly provided by Eli Lilly Co. (Indianapolis, IN). Immunex Compound 3 (IC3), supplied by Immunex Corporation, is identical to Compound 2 (17Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N.

Talon Metal Affinity Resin, used for His-tagged protein purification, was from Clontech. HEK-293 cells (a gift from Dr. C. Wu, University of Pittsburgh) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) (Cellgro, Inc.) supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all Biofluids). Transient transfection was achieved by introducing pCDNA 3.1-driven plasmids encoding GHR mutants (3 μg per transfection; see below for construction) with or without murine JAK2 (1 μg per transfection), as indicated, using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adenoviral infection of HEK-293 cells was accomplished using methods previously reported (18Lu C. Schwartzbauer G. Sperling M.A. Devaskar S.U. Thamotharan S. Robbins P.D. McTiernan C.F. Liu J.-L. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Menon R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22892-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The rbGHR cDNA was a kind gift of Dr. W. Wood, Genentech, Inc. Construction of the cDNA encoding rbGHRdel 297–406 has been described (19Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Zhang Y. Jiang J. Kopchick J.J. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33072-33084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This mutant (referred to herein as “wild-type” or WT) has intact extracellular and transmembrane domains, but lacks residues 297–406 in the cytoplasmic domain (the full-length rbGHR has 620 residues). Thus, the Box 1 region in the proximal cytoplasmic domain is intact, as is the distal two-thirds of the cytoplasmic domain, which contains known GHR tyrosine phosphorylation sites, but the major internalization motif is absent. This GHR mutant retains the ability to respond to GH by allowing tyrosine phosphorylation of itself and JAK2 (see Fig. 7) and STAT5 (data not shown). Ligation of rbGHRdel 297–406cDNA into the pcDNA 3.1 (−) eukaryotic expression vector was accomplished using XbaI and KpnI restriction endonucleases. A C-terminally His6-tagged version of rbGHRdel 297–406 (rbGHRdel 297–406-His) was prepared by PCR (sequences of oligonucleotide primers used available upon request) and ligated into the pAdlox (as in 18) adenoviral expression shuttle vector using the XbaI and KpnI 5′- and 3′-restriction sites, respectively. For preparation of cDNA encoding rbGHR1–274-Myc-His, the rbGHR cDNA was used as a template to first amplify the residue 1–274 region (sequences of primers available upon request). This product was ligated into the pcDNA6/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen) using KpnI and EcoRV restriction endonucleases. This yielded a cDNA encoding the first 274 residues of rbGHR followed by a 14-residue spacer and the Myc and His tags on the C terminus (rbGHR1–274-Myc-His) in the pcDNA vector. This receptor mutant lacks most of the cytoplasmic domain, but the presence of the C-terminal Myc tag allows easy detection of the receptor and its remnant with anti-Myc antibodies. To transfer this receptor-encoding cDNA into the pAdEasy adenoviral expression system, the fragment was removed with KpnI andPmeI and ligated into the pAdTrack shuttle vector at theKpnI and EcoRV sites. cDNAs expression vectors encoding the rbGHR cleavage region mutants, rbGHR-Δ237–239, rbGHR-Δ240–242, rbGHR-Δ242–244, rbGHR-237–239AAA, rbGHR-240–242AAA, and rbGHR-242–244AAA, were each constructed using the ExSite (Stratagene) PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method and the pCDNA3.1-rbGHRdel 297–406as the template. Sequences for the mutagenic oligonucleotides are available upon request. The deletion (Δ) mutations removed in-frame the three contiguous amino acids indicated (numbering as in Ref. 5Leung D.W.

Nature. 1987; 330: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar), while the alanine replacement mutations (AAA) changed the indicated residues to alanine. The entire protein coding sequence of each selected mutant cDNA was subjected to dideoxy DNA sequencing (UAB core facility), which verified the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of unwanted mutations. The methods for generating the adenovirally expressed version of rbGHRdel 297–406-His were as referred to in Ref. 18Lu C. Schwartzbauer G. Sperling M.A. Devaskar S.U. Thamotharan S. Robbins P.D.

Briefly, linearized pAdlox-rbGHRdel 297–406-His and ψ5 helper virus DNA were cotransfected into CRE8 cells (21Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (an HEK-293 derivative) by LipofectAMINE. The cells were harvested after several days when cytopathic effects became apparent. After lysis by three freeze/thaw cycles, cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and supernatant was collected. This supernatant was used for infection of HEK-293 cells. Three further rounds of infection were performed to obtain a high-titer viral stock, which was used for experimental and preparative infection. To generate adenovirally expressed rbGHR1–274-Myc-His, we used the Adeasy system (22He T.-C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Briefly, pAdTrack-rbGHR1–274-Myc-His was linearized withPacI and was cotransformed with pAdeasy (helper plasmid) into electrocompetent Escherichia coli BJ5138 cells. Colonies harboring recombinants were selected by virtue of kanamycin resistance. Linearized recombinant plasmid was transfected into HEK-293 cells and high titer viral stock was obtained as above for the pAdlox system. The 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and the 4G10 monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine (anti-pTyr) antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

Serum starvation of HEK-293 transfectants and infectants was accomplished by substitution of 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) for serum in their respective culture media for 16–20 h prior to experiments.

Briefly, adherent cells (dish size and number as indicated in figure legends) were stimulated in binding buffer (BB, consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dextrose) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Stimulations were terminated by washing the cells once with and then harvesting by scraping in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the presence of 0.4 mmsodium orthovanadate (PBS-vanadate). Pelleted cells were collected by brief centrifugation. For each cell type, pelleted cells were solubilized for 15 min at 4 °C in fusion lysis buffer (FLB) (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), as indicated. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the detergent extracts were electrophoresed under reducing conditions or subjected to immunoprecipitations, as indicated. For immunoprecipitation of the GHR with the monoclonal anti-GHRcyt-MAb antibodies, 0.6 μg of purified antibody was used per precipitation. Protein-A Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was used to adsorb immune complexes. For deglycosylation of rbGHR mutants, immunoprecipitates were eluted and treatment with endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or vehicle was carried out in accordance with previous published methods (25Silva C.M.

Resolution of proteins by SDS-PAGE, Western transfer of proteins, and blocking of Hybond-ECL (Amersham Biosciences) with 2% bovine serum albumin were performed as previously described (11Alele J.

Immunoblotting with antibodies 4G10 (1:4000), anti-GHRcyt-AL47 (1:1000), anti-Myc (1:2000), anti-pJAK2 (1:500), or anti-JAK2AL33(1:1000), with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:5000) and ECL detection reagents (all from Amersham Biosciences) and stripping and reprobing of blots were accomplished according to the manufacturer's suggestions. High titered adenovirus stock encoding rbGHR1–274-Myc-His, described above, was used to infect thirty 150 × 25 mm dishes of HEK-293 cells. After 24 h, the medium was removed, and serum-starvation was initiated. After 18 h, the cells were treated with PMA (1 μg/ml, final) for 30 min and then harvested and lysed with FLB, modified to lack EDTA. This detergent cell extract was applied to a TALON Metal Affinity Resin (Co2+-TC-Sepharose) column (15 ml). The column was washed twice with 50 ml of wash buffer (PBS with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), followed by three washes with 10 mm imidazole in PBS. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with 50 ml of PBS containing 150 mm imidazole. This eluate was concentrated by Centriprep-10K size exclusion. The concentrated sample was precipitated with ice-cold acetone. Proteins in this concentrate were resolved by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) and electrically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). A thin strip of the lane containing the purified proteins was cut off and immunoblotted with anti-Myc to verify the location of the band of interest. The remainder of the membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 and the Coomassie-stained band corresponding to the specific anti-Myc-identified remnant band was excised from the membrane for N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation (27Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an AppliedBiosystems 494Ht sequencer. GHBP activity was measured in conditioned media by a standard GH binding assay, as previously reported (11Alele J. Jiang J. Goldsmith J.F. Yang X. Maheshwari H.G. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J.

Metabolism. 1989; 38: 683-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium (0.05 or 0.4 ml, as indicated) from cells treated as indicated was incubated with freshly labeled 125I-hGH (∼0.5 ng) for 45 min at 37 °C. Bound GH was then immediately separated from free GH by gel chromatography on a Sephadex G-100 column at 4 °C. The fraction of GH bound was determined by peak integration. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls test, or paired Student's t test as appropriate. Densitometric quantitation of ECL immunoblots was performed using a video camera and the Image 1.49 program (developed by W. S. Rasband, Research Services Branch, NIMH, Bethesda, MD). For normalization of GHBP shedding in the experiments in Fig. 5 B, the relative abundance of transfected GHRs among transfections within an each experiment was estimated by densitometric scanning of the mature GHR form present in the immunoblot (such as in Fig. 5 A). The measured GHBP shed into the supernatant of each sample was thus corrected by the abundance of receptor expressed within that transfection to facilitate comparison between wild-type and mutants. In the experiments shown in Fig. 8, the relative degree of basal and GH-induced specific JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in cell extracts from cells pretreated with PMA versusMe2SO vehicle was estimated by measuring the intensity of the pJAK2 signal, normalized for the abundance of JAK2 in the sample (by anti-JAK2AL33 immunoblot signal) for each condition. JAK2 activation induced by GH in the Me2SO-pretreated samples within each transfection was considered 100%. As indicated when graphically shown, pooled data from several experiments are displayed as the mean ± S.E. The significance of differences of pooled results is estimated by unpaired Student's t tests.Figure 8GHR proteolysis and heterologous desensitization of signaling. A, wild type. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA 3.1-WT (rbGHRdel 297–406) plus pcDNA 3.1 JAK2 and divided into four equivalent samples. Serum-starved cells (one 90% confluent 60 × 15 mm dish per sample) were exposed to PMA (+) or the Me2SO vehicle (−) for 30 min prior to treatment with (+) or without (−) GH (500 ng/ml) for 10 min. Detergent cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and sequentially immunoblotted with anti-pJAK2 (upper panel) and anti-JAK2AL33 (lower panel). The positions of tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2 and total JAK2 are indicated. Note the decreased GH-induced JAK2 activation in the sample pretreated with PMA. The data shown are representative of three such experiments.B, non-cleavable (rbGHR-Δ237–239) and cleavable (rbGHR-237–239AAA) mutants. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA 3.1- rbGHR-Δ237–239 or pcDNA 3.1-rbGHR-237–239AAA plus pcDNA 3.1 JAK2 and each cotransfected pool was divided into four equivalent samples. Serum-starved cells (one 90% confluent 60 × 15-mm dish per sample) were exposed to GH with or without PMA pretreatment, as in A. Detergent cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE in duplicate and immunoblotted with anti-pJAK2 (upper panel) and anti-JAK2AL33(lower panel). The positions of tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2 and total JAK2 are indicated. In separate experiments (not shown), the specific 125I-hGH binding capacities of WT, rbGHR-Δ237–239, and rbGHR-237–239AAA transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells were quite similar (varying less than 10% between them). There was no significant 125I-hGH binding for HEK-293 cells transfected with the vector only. C, densitometric analysis of B. Multiple experiments for each receptor mutant shown in B (rbGHR-Δ237–239, n = 3; rbGHR-237–239AAA, n = 3) were analyzed densitometrically. Relative specific JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (mean ± S.E.), determined as under “Experimental Procedures,” is plotted.

https://openalex.org/W2047055556,"A striking characteristic of mRNA export factors is that they shuttle continuously between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This shuttling is mediated by specific factors interacting with peptide motifs called nuclear export signals (NES) and nuclear localization signals. We have identified a novel CRM-1-independent transferable NES and two nuclear localization signals in the Epstein-Barr virus mRNA export factor EB2 (also called BMLF1, Mta, or SM) localized at the N terminus of the protein between amino acids 61 and 146. We have also found that a previously described double NES (amino acids 213–236) does not mediate the nuclear shuttling of EB2, but is an interaction domain with the cellular export factor REFin vitro. This newly characterized REF interaction domain is essential for EB2-mediated mRNA export. Accordingly, in vivo, EB2 is found in complexes containing REF as well as the cellular factor TAP. However, these interactions are RNase-sensitive, suggesting that the RNA is an essential component of these complexes. A striking characteristic of mRNA export factors is that they shuttle continuously between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

Several cellular factors that mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNAs have now been identified (1Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 2Le Hir H. Moore M. Maquat L.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1098-1108PubMed Google Scholar, 3Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E.

Interestingly, some human herpesviruses carry, in their genome, genes whose products are also mRNA export factors, such as HSV-11 ICP27 (7Koffa M.D. Clements J.B. Izaurralde E. Wadd S. Wilson S.A. Mattaj I.W. Kuersten S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5769-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and the EBV BMLF1 early gene product originally called EB2 (8Chevallier-Greco A. Manet E. Chavrier P. Mosnier C. Daillie J. Sergeant A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3243-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), but later called Mta (9Fixman E.D. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5030-5039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or SM (10Cook I.D. Shanahan F. Farrell P.J. Virology. 1994; 205: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Such genes are conserved among all human herpesviruses, suggesting a conserved function for their products. At least for HSV-1 and EBV, the inactivation of ICP27 (11McCarthy A.M. McMahan L. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 18-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or EB2 (12Gruffat H. Batisse J. Pich D. Neuhierl B. Manet E. Hammerschmidt W. Sergeant A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9635-9644Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), respectively, abolishes the production of infectious viral particles, demonstrating that ICP27 and EB2 are essential factors for viral mRNA export and that their function cannot be trans-complemented by cellular factors. Moreover, EB2 appears to have an effect on cellular mRNAs because it has transforming properties when expressed both in established cell lines such as Rat1 and NIH3T3 and in primary rat fibroblasts (13Corbo L., Le Roux F. Sergeant A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3299-3304PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the HSV-1 and EBV early and late mRNAs are transcribed from intronless genes. However, it is now clearly established that the nuclear export of mRNAs is dramatically increased when a splicing event occurs (14Luo M. Reed R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14937-14942Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In effect, splicing leads to the deposition on the mRNA of a multiprotein export complex (called EJC forexon-exon junction complex), including REF/Aly (Yra1 in yeast), Y14, RNPS1, SRm160, and Magoh, 20–24 nucleotides upstream of the exon-exon junction (2Le Hir H. Moore M. Maquat L.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1098-1108PubMed Google Scholar, 3Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J.

Such a complex is thought to export mRNAs by recruiting TAP/Mex67p (15Grüter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) to cellular messenger RNPs (16Strässer K. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 410-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Stutz F. Bachi A. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Seraphin B. Wilm M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. RNA ( N.

For cellular mRNAs generated from intronless genes, they are likely to be exported to the cytoplasm by cellular factors through nonspecific interactions with mRNA-bound adapters like REF (19Rodrigues J.P. Rode M. Gatfield D. Blencowe B.J. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1030-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) or through sequence-specific interactions with SRp20 or 9G8 (20Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 899-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) or U2AF (21Zolotukhin A. Tan W. Bear J. Smulevitch S. Felber B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3935-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to speculate that EB2, like its HSV-1 functional homolog ICP27 (7Koffa M.D. Clements J.B. Izaurralde E. Wadd S. Wilson S.A. Mattaj I.W. Kuersten S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5769-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is an adapter of viral origin, involved in the export of intronless early and/or late viral mRNAs. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that ICP27 recruits the cellular mRNA export factors REF (Aly) and TAP/NXF1 (7Koffa M.D. Clements J.B. Izaurralde E. Wadd S. Wilson S.A. Mattaj I.W. Kuersten S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5769-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) to viral mRNAs generated from viral intronless genes, providing these viral mRNAs with access to the cellular mRNA nuclear export pathway. However, it was clear that in the absence of viral mRNA, ICP27 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling was TAP- and CRM-1-independent. This suggests that ICP27-mediated mRNA export and ICP27 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling follow different pathways and are probably mediated by different ICP27 domains. However, the ICP27 CRM-1-independent nuclear export signal (NES) has not as yet been characterized. The EBV EB2 protein also shares properties with mRNA export factors: (i) it exports both intronless and intron-containing RNAs (22Semmes O.J. Chen L. Sarisky R. Gao Z. Zhong L. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9526-9534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Buisson M. Hans F. Kusters I. Duran N. Sergeant A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4090-4100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Farjot G. Buisson M. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6068-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); (ii) it shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (22Semmes O.J. Chen L. Sarisky R. Gao Z. Zhong L. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9526-9534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Farjot G. Buisson M. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6068-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Boyle S.M. Ruvolo V. Gupta A.K. Swaminathan S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6872-6881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) it is thought to carry two contiguous CRM-1-dependent NES (26Chen L. Liao G. Fujimoro M. Semmes O.J. Hayward S.D. Virology. 2001; 288: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the EB2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling has also been described to be CRM-1-independent (24Farjot G. Buisson M. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6068-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). EB2 also appears to homodimerize or multimerize (27Key S.C. Yoshizaki T. Pagano J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8485-8492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and binds to RNA in vivo (28Ruvolo V. Gupta A.K. Swaminathan S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6033-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although no EB2-specific RNA sequences have been identified on EB2 RNA targets. In this report, we have characterized the EB2 sequences required for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and mRNA export. We show that the EB2 domain between amino acids 218 and 236, which have been reported to carry a CRM-1-dependent double NES (26Chen L. Liao G. Fujimoro M. Semmes O.J. Hayward S.D. Virology. 2001; 288: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), can be deleted without affecting the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of EB2 and does not constitute a functional NES. However, we demonstrate that this designated double NES region binds REF both in vitro andin vivo and is essential for EB2-mediated mRNA export. Moreover, we found that the N-terminal region of EB2 carries a CRM-1-independent NES and two nuclear localization signals (NLS) that mediate the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of EB2. The following eukaryotic expression plasmids are all SV40 early promoter-based vectors. When F precedes the name of the protein, the corresponding protein was tagged at its N terminus with the FLAG epitope, which can be detected by monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma). pSG5F.EB2 contains the intronlessBSLF2/BMLF1 cDNA and encodes the wild-type EB2 protein (23Buisson M. Hans F. Kusters I. Duran N. Sergeant A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4090-4100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pSG5F.EB2.dNES expresses an EB2 protein deleted of amino acids 225–236 in the two putative NES regions, as described (26Chen L. Liao G. Fujimoro M. Semmes O.J. Hayward S.D. Virology. 2001; 288: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). pSG5F-EB2.ΔDN expresses an EB2 protein with the two putative NES (amino acids 218–236) entirely deleted. These two plasmids were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of pSG5F.EB2 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotide primer 5′-CTCCAAGATTACATTTGCGGCCGCGGAGCCCATCCAAGAC-3′ and its complement on the opposite strand for pSG5F.EB2.dNES, 5′-GACATGAGTCTGGTTAAGGAGCCCATCCAAGAC-3′, and its complement on the opposite strand for pSG5F.EB2.ΔDN. Mutations in the putative EB2 NLS sequences were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit. For the KR1 mutation (127KRRR130 → AAAA), the oligonucleotide primer 5′-CACCAGAGGCCACGCAGCGGCAGCCGGAGAGGTCCATGG-3′ and its complement on the opposite strand were used. For the KR2 mutation (143KRR145 → AAA), the oligonucleotide primer 5′-GATGAAAGTTATGGCGCGGCCGCACACCTGCCCCC-3′ and its complement on the opposite strand were used. pSG5F.EB2.Cter has been described elsewhere (29Farjot G. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17309-17317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The NLS sequence from the SV40 T antigen (APKKKRKV) was introduced between the FLAG and the EB2 C-terminal DNA sequences to generate pSG5F.NLS.EB2.Cter. Seven partially overlapping EB2 DNA fragments (fragments B–H) were cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) to produce GST proteins fused to EB2 peptides B–H (see Fig. 1). EB2 DNA fragments B–H were generated by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CGGGATCCGATGAAGATCCAACT-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGACTTTCATCGGTGCA-3′ for fragment B, 5′-CGGGATCCTCTTACACCAGAGGC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGCGTTCTTGCCTCGC-3′ for fragment C, 5′-CGGGATCCCCCCGGTCAGAATCT-3′ and 5′-CGGCTCGAGCTGCCAGGCTCCAAT-3′ for fragment D, 5′-CGGGATCCGACCCGTTCCTACAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGTAGGTGATCTCCTG-3′ for fragment E, 5′-CGGGATCCCTCTGCACCCTGGTG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTTGTTTTGACGGGC-3′ for fragment F, 5′-CGGGATTCCGACTACAACTTTGTG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTCTGTCAAAAGGGA-3′ for fragment G, and 5′-CGGGATCCTTCCTGGGCCACTAC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTGATTTAATCCAGG-3′ for fragment H. These PCR fragments were subsequently digested with BamHI andXhoI for insertion between the BamHI andXhoI sites of pGEX-4T-2. The same EB2 DNA fragments (B–H) were also ligated to a DNA sequence encoding the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein in the eukaryotic expression plasmid pCMV-MS2 (a generous gift from Dr. B. R. Cullen) (30Yang J. Bogerd H.P. Wang J.P. Page D.C. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 397-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to produce MS2-EB2 peptide fusion proteins. Fragments B–H were obtained by PCR amplification using oligonucleotides similar to those listed above, except for the substitution of the BamHI site present in each upper strand oligonucleotide with an EcoRI site. Fragment A was obtained by PCR amplification using the following two oligonucleotides: 5′-CGGAATTCATGGTTCCTTCTCAG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCGATGAAGATCCAACT-3′. The PCR fragments were subsequently cut with EcoRI and XhoI for insertion between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pCMV-MS2. The hnRNP-K NLS/NES DNA sequence was generated by PCR using oligonucleotide primers 5′-CGGGATCCTATGACAGAAGAGGGAGA-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGATAAGCCATCTGCCATTC-3′, cut with BamHI andXhoI for insertion into pGEX-4T-2 to express GST-KNS (where KNS is the Knuclear shuttling domain). Plasmid pCMV.NLS.βgal was constructed by inserting the SV40 T antigen NLS into plasmid pCMVβ (Clontech) by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene kit) using oligonucleotide 5′-GAGCTGCTCAAGCGCGATGCTAGCGGGCCTAAGAAGAAGCGCAAAGTCAGATCTGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTG-3′ and its complement on the opposite strand. pCMV.NLS.B.βgal was then constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified fragment generated from EB2 using the following two oligonucleotides: 5′-CGGGATCCGATGAAGATCCAACT-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCACTTTCATCGGTGCA-3′. PCR DNA fragment B was then cut withBamHI and inserted downstream of the SV40 T antigen NLS into a BglII site of pCMV.NLS.βgal introduced by site-directed mutagenesis concomitantly with the SV40 T antigen NLS. The REF constructs used in this study have been described elsewhere (19Rodrigues J.P. Rode M. Gatfield D. Blencowe B.J. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1030-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and were a generous gift from Dr. E. Izaurralde. The reporter plasmid pDM128/PL has been described by Yang et al. (30Yang J. Bogerd H.P. Wang J.P. Page D.C. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 397-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and was a generous gift from Dr. B. R. Cullen. HeLa cells and 293T cells carrying an EBV BMLF1-knockout recombinant (293BMLF1-KO cells) were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were seeded at 8 × 105 cells/100-mm Petri dish 10 h prior to transfection. Transfections of HeLa cells were performed by the calcium precipitate method as described previously (24Farjot G. Buisson M. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6068-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of 293BMLF1-KOcells (12Gruffat H. Batisse J. Pich D. Neuhierl B. Manet E. Hammerschmidt W. Sergeant A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9635-9644Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were performed by electroporation (950 microfarads, 220 mV) using a Bio-Rad electroporator. Plasmids used for transfections were prepared by the alkaline lysis method and purified through two CsCl gradients. To evaluate CAT protein expression, we used CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After transfection, cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline. Half of the cells were use for CAT assays according to the manufacturer's instructions. The other half were used to monitor protein expression by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody M2. HeLa cells were transfected in 100-mm Petri dishes by the calcium precipitate method as previously described (31Buisson M. Manet E. Biemont M.C. Gruffat H. Durand B. Sergeant A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5276-5284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h post-transfection, the precipitate was washed, and cells were trypsinized. Approximately 2 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded on glass coverslips with an equal number of NIH3T3 cells in 35-mm dishes. The cells were allowed to grow overnight and were then treated for 2 h with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis and 25 nm leptomycin B (LMB) (kindly provided by Dr. B. Wolff) when inhibition of CRM-1-dependent protein export was required. Subsequently, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and heterokaryon formation was carried out by incubating the coverslips for 2 min in 50% polyethylene glycol 3000–3700 (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Following cell fusion, coverslips were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and returned to fresh medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and 25 mm LMB when needed. After 2 h at 37 °C, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and indirect immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described previously (24Farjot G. Buisson M. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6068-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the various immunofluorescence experiments, we used anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2, anti-hnRNP-C monoclonal antibody 4F4 (kindly provided by Dr. G. Dreyfuss) (32Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), anti-Rev monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. B. Wolff) (33Wolff B. Sanglier J.-J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), or anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as the primary antibody. An Alexa Fluor-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L; Interchim) was used as the secondary antibody, and the nuclei of the cells were stained by incubation with a Hoechst 33258 solution (Sigma) at 5 μg/ml. GST fusion proteins (2 mg/ml) were injected into either the nucleus or the cytoplasm of HeLa cells or HeLa cell polykaryons generated as described above using an Eppendorf Transjector 5246, an Eppendorf micromanipulator (Injectman), and a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope. Texas Red-labeled dextran (70 kDa; Molecular Probes, Inc.) was systematically added at a concentration of 2 mg/ml to the microinjection solution so as to mark the injection site. Microinjections were monitored using a Sony digital camera and a Sony TV monitor. 5–10 cells or polykaryons on average per experiment were microinjected, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. After microinjection, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The GST fusion proteins were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (24Farjot G. Buisson M. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6068-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-GST antibody (a generous gift from Dr. J. J. Diaz) was used at a 1:500 dilution. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:2000 dilution. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 pLys bacteria and purified with glutathione-agarose beads following standard procedures.35S-Labeled F.EB2 and F.EB2 mutants were produced in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitrotranscription/translation TNT system (Promega). Binding reactions were carried out in 500 μl of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.3, for 1 h at 4 °C, and then complexes bound to the glutathione-agarose beads were washed five times with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by autoradiography. In some experiments, RNase A (10 μg) and RNase T1 (10 μg) were added to the last wash and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. For immunoprecipitation, transfected HeLa or 293BMLF1-KO cells were harvested from 100-mm dishes 48 h post-transfection and lysed in 300 μl of TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was then passed five times through a syringe with a 26-gauge needle, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. Cell extracts were incubated with 50 μl of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) for 4 h in TNE buffer at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed five times with cold buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) as described by Koffa et al. (7Koffa M.D. Clements J.B. Izaurralde E. Wadd S. Wilson S.A. Mattaj I.W. Kuersten S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5769-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted by incubation of the immunoprecipitate with a peptide/FLAG solution at 40 μg/ml in buffer A before loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to murine REF (KJ70) (19Rodrigues J.P. Rode M. Gatfield D. Blencowe B.J. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1030-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and TAP (34Braun I. Rohrbach E. Schmitt C. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1953-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (both a generous gift from Dr. E. Izaurralde). In some experiments, RNase A (10 μg) and RNase T1 (10 μg) were added to the cell extracts prior to immunoprecipitation for 15 min at room temperature. A computer-assisted search for NLS sequences indicated that EB2 contains a putative bipartite NLS (KR1 and KR2) (Fig. 1), which could contribute to the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of EB2, together with the double NES located in peptide D (NES1/NES2) (Fig. 1) previously characterized by Chen et al. (26Chen L. Liao G. Fujimoro M. Semmes O.J. Hayward S.D. Virology. 2001; 288: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To locate more precisely the EB2 NLS and NES, we microinjected a series of fusion proteins between GST and the EB2 peptides represented in Fig. 1 into single nuclei of HeLa cell polykaryons. Texas Red-labeled dextran was co-injected to mark the injection site. As shown in Fig. 2 A, GST diffused passively in the cytoplasm, but was not imported in the non-injected nuclei, probably due to the lack of NLS. As expected, GST-peptide C, which contains the putative bipartite NLS, was restricted to the injected nucleus. Surprisingly, GST-peptide B was found in all the nuclei of the injected polykaryons, suggesting that it shuttled between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Peptide B may thus contain both an NLS and an NES. In contrast, GST-peptide D, which contains the putative double NES mapped by Chen et al. (26Chen L. Liao G. Fujimoro M. Semmes O.J. Hayward S.D. Virology. 2001; 288: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was restricted to the injected nucleus. A fusion protein between GST and the KNS domain of the hnRNP-K protein (32Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), used as a control shuttling protein, was found in all the nuclei of the injected polykaryons, similar to GST-peptide B. The GST-peptide B, C, and D fusion proteins were also injected into the cytoplasm of HeLa cell polykaryons (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with the previous results, GST-peptide B was exclusively located in the nucleoplasm, whereas both GST-peptide C and GST-peptide D stayed at the injection site, the cytoplasm. It should be noted that in contrast to GST-peptide D, GST-peptide C, which was expected to be localized in the nucleus, did not diffuse into the cytoplasm, suggesting that GST-peptide C might be aggregated at the microinjection site. The GST-peptide E, F, G, and H fusion proteins (Fig. 1) were also injected into one single nucleus or into the cytoplasm of HeLa cell polykaryons and were exclusively localized in the injected cellular compartment, strongly suggesting that GST-peptide B did not diffuse passively (data not shown). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that peptide B carries an NLS and an NES and that both are transferable. To confirm the localization of the EB2 NLS sequences, peptides A–H were also fused to the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein and expressed in COS-7 cells. Only MS2-peptide B and MS2-peptide C proteins were found to be exclusively nuclear (Fig. 3), confirming that both peptides contain NLS sequences. Because peptide B contains only the KR1 motif of the putative bipartite NLS, this suggests that KR1 functions independently of KR2, rather than being part of a bipartite NLS. Accordingly (Fig. 4), mutation of the KR1 motif (KRRR → AAAA in F.EB2.M1) in the full-length F.EB2 protein only slightly impaired the nuclear localization of EB2, whereas mutation of the KR2 motif (KRR → AAA in F.EB2.M2) was silent. However, mutation of both KR1 and KR2 (mutant F.EB2.M1.2) almost completely abrogated nuclear translocation. This demonstrates the presence of two independent functional NLS regions, suggesting that EB2 contains two independent functional NLS domains.Figure 4The EB2 NLS is composed of two functionally independent KR-rich motifs. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged mutant EB2 proteins as indicated. Mutants F.EB2.M1 and F.EB2.M2 have their KR1 or KR2 motif (see Fig. 1) mutated, respectively. Mutant F.EB2.M1.2 has both motifs mutated, and F.EB2.Cter is deleted of the first 184 amino acids. The cells were immunostained using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 as the primary antibody and Alexa Fluor-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody to determine the localization of the proteins and stained with Hoechst dye to visualize the nuclei.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To ascertain the presence of an NES in peptide B, we wanted to demonstrate that it could confer nucleocytoplasmic shuttling to a heterologous non-shuttling protein whose size was incompatible with passive diffusion between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Moreover, because we have previously reported that EB2 shuttles via a CRM-1-independent pathway (24Farjot G. Buisson M. Duc Dodon M. Gazzolo L. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6068-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the heterologous protein should be resistant to LMB, a specific inhibitor of CRM-1. We therefore transferred peptide B to the β-galactosidase carrying the SV40 T antigen NLS motif (NLS.B.βgal) (Fig. 5 A) and tested this fusion protein in a human-mouse heterokaryon assay in the presence of cycloheximide to suppress de novo protein synthesis. In this assay (Fig. 5 B), NLS.B.βgal was found both in the transfected HeLa nuclei and in the murine nuclei of heterokaryons (panels e and f), suggesting that this protein shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. NLS.βgal (used as a control) was exclusively nuclear and, as expected, was found only in the HeLa cell nuclei of heterokaryons (panels c andd). Most interestingly, shuttling of NLS.B.βgal was insensitive to LMB (panels k and l), similar to that of F.EB2 (compare panels g and h withpanels a and b). As a control for the functionality of LMB, the HIV Rev protein was expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 5 C). As already reported (33Wolff B. Sanglier J.-J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), in transfected HeLa cells, Rev is located in the nucleolus and the cytoplasm; but in the presence of LMB, which inhibits Rev nuclear export, Rev is located mainly in the nucleolus. This is what we also observed (Fig. 5), demonstrating that LMB is active. These results strongly suggest that peptide B contains a CRM-1-independent transferable NES. It has been previously reported by Chen et al.(26Chen L. Liao G. Fujimoro M. Semmes O.J. Hayward S.D. Virology."

IL-19 shares a receptor complex with IL-20, indicating that the biological activities of these two cytokines overlap and that both may play an important role in regulating development and proper functioning of the skin. We determined the crystal structure of human recombinant IL-19 and refined it at 1.95-Å resolution to an R-factor of 0.157. Unlike IL-10, which forms an intercalated dimer, the molecule of IL-19 is a monomer made of seven amphipathic helices, A–G, creating a unique helical bundle. On the basis of the observed structure, we propose that IL-19, IL-20, and other putative members of the proposed IL-10 family together form a distinct subfamily of helical cytokines.

Receptors from this family also form heterodimeric complexes for type I and type II interferons and for other IL-10-related cytokines. Tissue factor, which binds coagulation factor VIIa, also makes use of receptors belonging to this family. Binding of IL-19 to the receptor complex results in STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent activation of a reporter gene controlled by a minimal promoter containing STAT-binding sites (2Dumoutier L. Leemans C. Lejeune D. Kotenko S.V. Renauld J.-C. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3545-3549Google Scholar).The transcription of the IL-19 gene has been detected in resting monocytes and, at lower level, in B cells (11Wolk K. Kunz S. Asadullah K. Sabat R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5397-5402Google Scholar); it is up-regulated in monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (1Gallagher G. Dickensheets H. Eskdale J. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Peat J.D. Vazquez N. Pestka S. Donnelly R.P. Kotenko S.V. Genes Immun. 2000; 1: 442-450Google Scholar, 11Wolk K. Kunz S. Asadullah K. Sabat R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5397-5402Google Scholar). Priming monocytes with IL-4 or IL-13 but not with interferon-γ significantly increases the levels of IL-19 mRNA induced by subsequent lipopolysaccharide treatment (1Gallagher G. Dickensheets H. Eskdale J. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Peat J.D. Vazquez N. Pestka S. Donnelly R.P. Kotenko S.V. Genes Immun. 2000; 1: 442-450Google Scholar). IL-19 mRNA also has been detected in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes (1Gallagher G. Dickensheets H. Eskdale J. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Peat J.D. Vazquez N. Pestka S. Donnelly R.P. Kotenko S.V. Genes Immun. 2000; 1: 442-450Google Scholar, 11Wolk K. Kunz S. Asadullah K. Sabat R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5397-5402Google Scholar), suggesting that viral infection can induce IL-19 expression in certain cells. The pattern of expression of IL-19 receptor subunits can reveal the site for IL-19 action. Because the simultaneous presence in a cell of both receptor subunits CRF2–8 (IL-20R1) and CRF2–11 (IL-20R2) is required for IL-19 activity, only tissues in which the expression of both subunits has been detected can be considered a potential target for IL-19 action. IL-20R2 has a more limited pattern of expression than IL-20R1 (7Blumberg H. Conklin D., Xu, W.F. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Google Scholar), and thus the expression of IL-20R2 should be a limiting factor dictating the physiological sites of action of IL-19. Expression of mRNAs for both receptors, although at different levels, has been detected in the skin, testis, ovary, heart, lung, muscle, placenta, adrenal gland, small intestine, and salivary gland (7Blumberg H. Conklin D., Xu, W.F. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Google Scholar). The expression of the IL-19 receptor subunits in skin is of a particular interest because it has been found to be up-regulated in psoriatic skin, whereas normal skin has low levels of receptor expression. The expression of receptors also has been detected in keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and immune cells in psoriatic lesions. Moreover, IL-20-transgenic mice die within days after birth with skin abnormalities characteristic for psoriasis (7Blumberg H. Conklin D., Xu, W.F. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Google Scholar). Sharing of the same receptor complex by both IL-19 and IL-20 suggests that IL-19 should have overlapping biological activities with IL-20 and thus may be a player in psoriatic lesions. Therefore, the pattern of expression of IL-19 and its receptors suggests that this cytokine may be involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses in various tissues and may be particularly important for proper skin development and functioning.Genes encoding IL-10-related cytokines are clustered on human chromosomes 1 and 12 and possess similar structural organization (4Kotenko S.V. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 223-240Google Scholar), indicating that they evolved from a common predecessor. Structural homology of the genes for IL-10-related cytokines also extends to the limited homology of amino acid sequences of the cytokines in the 20–40% range. At present, the structures of IL-10 and two of its virally encoded analogs have been solved, and they represent intercalating homodimers (12Zdanov A. Schalk-Hihi C. Gustchina A. Tsang M. Weatherbee J. Wlodawer A. Structure. 1995; 3: 591-601Google Scholar, 13Zdanov A. Schalk-Hihi C. Wlodawer A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1955-1962Google Scholar, 14Walter M.R. Nagabhushan T.L.

Cook J. Barry P.A. Walter M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9404-9409Google Scholar). By contrast, the recently solved structure of IL-22 (17Nagem R.A.P. Colau D. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.-C.,J.C. Ogata C. Polikarpov I. Structure. 2002; 10: 1051-1062Google Scholar) shows that this cytokine, although a crystallographic dimer, is a monomer both in solution and as a biological unit. Here we report the crystal structure of IL-19 (Fig. 1) at the resolution 1.95 Å. Similar to IL-22 but unlike IL-10, IL-19 was found to be a monomer both in the solution and in the crystal, and we conclude that the subgroup of cytokines of which it is a member should be considered structurally quite distinct from IL-10 itself. The identification of IL-191 as a secreted protein and a cytokine (1Gallagher G. Dickensheets H. Eskdale J. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Peat J.D. Vazquez N. Pestka S. Donnelly R.P. Kotenko S.V.

Here we report the crystal structure of IL-19 (Fig. 1) at the resolution 1.95 Å. Similar to IL-22 but unlike IL-10, IL-19 was found to be a monomer both in the solution and in the crystal, and we conclude that the subgroup of cytokines of which it is a member should be considered structurally quite distinct from IL-10 itself."
https://openalex.org/W1988049205,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (AA) play an important role in alcohol-induced liver injury. AA promotes toxicity in rat hepatocytes with high levels of cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) and in HepG2 E47 cells, which express CYP2E1. The possible role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) members in this process was evaluated. SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, and PD98059, an ERK inhibitor, but not wortmannin a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, prevented AA toxicity in pyrazole hepatocytes and E47 cells. SB203580 prevented the enhancement of AA toxicity by salicylate. SB203580 neither lowered the levels of CYP2E1 nor affected CYP2E1-dependent oxidative stress. The decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential produced by AA was prevented by SB203580. Treating CYP2E1-induced cells with AA activated p38 MAPK but not ERK or AKT. This activation was blocked by antioxidants. AA increased the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. Salicylate blocked this translocation, which may contribute to the enhancement of AA toxicity by salicylate. SB203580 restored AA-induced NF-κB translocation, which may contribute to protection against toxicity. In conclusion, AA toxicity was related to lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, and to the activation of p38 MAPK, as a consequence of CYP2E1-dependent production of reactive oxygen species. Activation of p38 MAPK by AA coupled to AA-induced oxidative stress may synergize to cause cell toxicity by affecting mitochondrial membrane potential and by modulation of NF-κB activation.

In the intragastric infusion model of ethanol feeding, liver injury occurs when the rats consume diets containing polyunsaturated fatty acid but not saturated fatty acid (7Nanji A.A. Zhao S.

This model is associated with induction of high levels of CYP2E1 and greatly increased lipid peroxidation, which appear to contribute to the liver injury. AA induced toxicity in HepG2 E47 cells, a cell line that expresses CYP2E1 but not control HepG2 cells, which do not express CYP2E1 (9Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14532-14541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). AA also induced toxicity in pyrazole-induced rat hepatocytes with high levels of CYP2E1 but not saline control hepatocytes (10Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 204: 157-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This AA toxicity was prevented by inhibitors of CYP2E1 and by antioxidants (9Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol.

Members of the kinase family, originally found to be activated by mitogens, have now been found to be activated by a wide variety of mitogenic and non-mitogenic agents via a cascade of kinase/effector molecules which, in mammalian cells, includes protein kinase C, p21, Raf-1, and MEK (MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, ERK) (14Marshall C.J.

AA or its metabolites can activate MAPK members such as ERKs and JNKs/SAPKs, suggesting an important role for AA and its metabolites in mitogenic signaling events (17Paine E. Palmantier R.

We recently reported that salicylate can potentiate the toxicity of AA in CYP2E1-induced hepatocytes (19Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Salicylate was found to increase CYP2E1 levels, preventing its degradation, and this may be one mechanism by which salicylate increases AA-induced toxicity. Sodium salicylate and acetylsalicylic acid are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents that prevent activation of nuclear factor κB by inhibition of phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB, or by direct inhibition of IκB kinase (20- 23). Salicylate also interferes with MAPK and other kinase-dependent signaling pathways (24Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Damage to mitochondria plays an important role in AA plus CYP2E1-dependent toxicity (29Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1420-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whether MAPKs are involved in the AA-induced toxicity, and if so, how MAPKs induce or regulate this toxicity have not been reported, for cytochrome P450-dependent processes in general, and specifically for CYP2E1. In the present study, we characterized the possible role of the MAPKs, p38 and ERK, and PI3K on AA or AA plus salicylate-induced toxicity in pyrazole-induced rat hepatocytes, human hepatocyte cultures, and HepG2 E47 cells. Effects of specific kinase inhibitors on cellular toxicity, CYP2E1 levels, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and NF-κB activation and the role of MAPKs in the salicylate enhancement of AA-induced toxicity were evaluated. Results show that AA or AA plus salicylate activated p38 MAPK but not ERK or PI3K, and that p38 MAPK plays a role in AA-induced cytotoxicity in CYP2E1-expressing cells. Rats received humane care, and studies were carried out according to the criteria outline in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 150–170 g body weight were injected intraperitoneally with pyrazole, 200 mg/kg body weight, once a day for 2 days to induce CYP2E1. After overnight fasting, rat hepatocytes were isolated by a two-step collagenase perfusion method (30Wu D. Clejan L.A. Potter B. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Induction of CYP2E1 was validated by Western blot analysis and catalytic activity withp-nitrophenol. Cell viability was generally about 90%. Hepatocytes were seeded onto 100-mm culture dishes, which were coated with the basement membrane Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and cultured in serum-free HeptoZYME-SFM medium (Invitrogen) containing 1% penicillin and streptomycin. One to two hours after seeding, the medium was changed, unattached cells were gently washed out, and the cell culture experiments were initiated. Human hepatocyte cultures plated on rat tail collagen-coated flasks (T-25) in serum-supplemented media were obtained from the Liver Tissue Procurement and Distribution System (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). E47 cells are HepG2 cells that were transfected with a human CYP2E1 cDNA in the sense orientation and constitutively express CYP2E1. C34 cells are HepG2 cells that were transfected with the pCI vector only; these cells do not express CYP2E1 (9Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14532-14541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The HepG2 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 100 units/ml penicillin plus 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Hepatocyte or HepG2 cell cultures were treated with arachidonic acid (AA, 60 μm), with or without salicylate (sal, 5 mm) in the presence or absence of 10 μm SB203580 (a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor), 10 μm PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor) (Calbiochem Inc.), or 0.1–10 μm wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor, Sigma Chemical Co.) for 24 h. Inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO, and controls were incubated with Me2SO (0.6% v/v final concentration). As a non-CYP2E1-dependent control, hepatocytes were treated with 15 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor α plus 40 μmcycloheximide in the presence or absence of MAPK or PI3K inhibitors. Cytotoxicity was determined by assays of either trypan blue exclusion or reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide as described previously (31Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23914-23919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To study whether SB203580 modulates the CYP2E1 level, Pyrazole-induced rat hepatocytes were incubated with either 10 μm SB203580 (or Me2SO solvent control) or 5 mm sal for 1 or 2 days. Microsomes were prepared by differential centrifugation, and SDS-PAGE was carried out using 10 μg of microsomal protein. The blotted membranes were incubated with a monospecific polyclonal CYP2E1 antibody, followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Fluorescence was developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence immunoblot-detecting agent (ECL, AmershamBiosciences). The arbitrary unit of density of each band was scanned with a computer software program (UN-SCAN-IT, Automated Digitizing System, version 5.1, Silk Scientific Corp.). Cells were treated with AA or AA plus sal in the presence or absence of 10 μm SB203580, 10 μm PD98059, 10 μm wortmannin, or Me2SO (solvent for the kinase inhibitors) for 24 h. Cells were harvested and sonicated in PBS for 10 s in an ice bath using a W-375 sonicator (50% duty cycle, output at 4 watts). The cellular lysate was collected, and cell extract containing 0.2 mg of protein was incubated with 0.2 ml of trichloroacetic acid-TBA-HCl solution in a 100 °C water bath for 1 h as previously described (19Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1420-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive products (TBARS) was determined by measuring absorbance at 535 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 1.56 × 105m/cm to calculate malondialdehyde equivalents. As a control, the potential antioxidant activity of SB203580 was evaluated using isolated rat liver microsomes incubated with iron-ADP plus NADPH as previously described (32Carro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with AA or AA plus sal in the presence or absence of 10 μm SB203580, 10 μm PD98059, or 10 μm wortmannin for 10, 20, or 30 min. The cells were harvested and sonicated as described above. The cellular extract (15 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-PAGE using an 8% gel. The blotted membranes were incubated with either polyclonal p38 or ERK MAPK antibodies or AKT polyclonal antibody to detect the total content of these kinases or incubated with the appropriate phosphorylated monoclonal antibodies, respectively (Santa Cruz), to determine the content of the activated, phosphorylated kinase. The blots were then incubated with either anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and fluorescence developed, and results were analyzed as described above. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were grown on a glass slide placed in culture dishes. The cells were treated as described above. At the end of treatment, the cells on the glass slide were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and incubated with NF-κB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. After rinsing several times in PBS, the slides were incubated with anti-IgG antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The slides were rinsed several times with PBS and mounted onto a microscopy glass slide with mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The localization of NF-κB in the nucleus or the cytosol was observed under a fluorescence microscope. To determine the effect of AA or AA plus sal on NF-κB DNA binding activity, cells were treated with AA or AA plus sal in the presence or absence of 10 μm SB203580, 10 μm PD98059, or 10 μm wortmannin for 30 min or for 24 h. Cells were harvested and lysed with a lysis solution containing 0.32 msucrose, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min. After centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min, the pellet was collected and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis solution and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 0.42m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml antipain, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2.5 μg/ml bestatin, incubated for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant containing nuclear extract was collected, and 10 μg of nuclear extract was used to carry out the electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a kit (Promega) according the protocol offered by the company. The NF-κB oligonucleotide in the kit was labeled with [32P]ATP, and bands on the gel were visualized by exposure to the Kodak film and then developed. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was analyzed from the accumulation of rhodamine 123. Hepatocytes were seeded onto six-well dishes for 1–2 h, and unattached hepatocytes were gently removed and replaced with fresh medium. The cells were treated with AA, or AA plus sal with or without 10 μm SB203580, 10 μm PD98059, or 10 μm wortmannin for 20 h. One hour before ending the treatment, rhodamine 123 (5 μg/ml) was added to the medium. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in 0.5–0.8 ml of PBS. The intensity of the fluorescence from rhodamine 123 was determined with a Fas-Scan flow cytometer as previously described (29Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1420-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One-way ANOVA (ANOVA with subsequent post hoc comparisons by Sheffe) was performed (Version 10.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL).p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant; values reflect means ± S.E., and the number of experiments are given in the figure legends. HepG2 E47 cells were treated with 60 μm AA or 60 μm AA plus 5 mm sal for 12, 24, or 36 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, and cell viability (trypan blue exclusion) was determined. As shown in Fig. 1, AA or AA plus sal induced significant toxicity in E47 cells in a time-dependent manner. Salicylate, which was not toxic by itself, increased the toxicity by AA as described previously (19Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). SB203580 by itself was not toxic to the E47 cells, however, SB203580 lowered the AA or AA plus sal-induced toxicity e.g. from 60 or 80% at 24 h in the absences of SB203580 to toxicity values of 20 or 30% (p < 0.05) in the presence of SB203580. Similar protection by SB203580 was observed in AA concentration dependence experiments, e.g. in the absence of SB203580, toxicity by 15, 30, or 60 μm AA at 24 h was 24 ± 3, 34 ± 7, and 60 ± 6%, respectively, whereas the toxicity in the presence of 10 μm SB203580 was lowered to values of 18 ± 2, 20 ± 3, and 22 ± 7% (p < 0.05) at 15, 30, or 60 μm AA, respectively (data not shown). C34 cells, which do not express CYP2E1, only exhibited a small response to AA or AA plus sal (TableI) as compared with the E47 cells, which was not altered by SB203580. The effect of SB203580 on another model of toxicity, independent of CYP2E1, was evaluated. In contrast to results with AA or AA plus salicylate in E47 cells, the toxicity by tumor necrosis factor α plus cycloheximide was similar in E47 and C34 cells, and this toxicity was not altered by SB203580 (Table I). Thus, there appears to be some specificity in the protective actions of SB203580.Table IThe inhibition of P38 MAPK prevents AA and AA plus salicylate-induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 E47 cellsTreatmentCytotoxicityE47 cellsC34 cells%None4.8 ± 1.73.8 ± 1.0Salicylate6.5 ± 1.05.3 ± 1.5SB2035806.0 ± 1.86.5 ± 1.0AA31.5 ± 8.71-aNova statistic analysis, p < 0.05 compared with control group.5.3 ± 1.0AA + Sal57.0 ± 7.51-aNova statistic analysis, p < 0.05 compared with control group.13.0 ± 2.9AA + SB20358010.5 ± 2.31-bNova statistic analysis, p < 0.05 compared with AA treatment group.9.5 ± 1.3AA + Sal + SB20358028.0 ± 7.81-cNova statistic analysis, p < 0.05 compared with AA + Sal group.12.0 ± 3.2TNF5.0 ± 3.44.5 ± 1.7CHX5.5 ± 1.76.0 ± 0.8TNF + CHX37.3 ± 6.939.5 ± 3.9TNF + CHX + Sal42.8 ± 6.947.3 ± 7.5TNF + CHX + Sal + SB20358045.8 ± 9.744.0 ± 15.1HepG2 E47 cells, which express CYP2E1, and control HepG2 cells, which do not express CYP2E1 (C34 cells), were incubated with the indicated treatments, 5 mm sodium salicylate, 60 μm AA, AA plus salicylate, 10 μm SB203580 alone or with AA or with AA plus salicylate.

Results are from three experiments. To extend the results with the HepG2 cells to primary liver cells, rats were treated with pyrazole (PY) to increase hepatic CYP2E1 levels. Hepatocytes from PY-induced rats were treated with AA or AA plus sal, and cell viability was assayed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction. Cell viability was decreased to 44 ± 5 or 31 ± 10% after 24 h of culture with 60 μm AA or 60 μmAA plus 5 mm sal, respectively (data not shown). Adding SB203580 a p38 MAPK inhibitor or PD98059, an ERK MAPK inhibitor, lowered this toxicity. In the presence of SB203580, cell viability increased to 84 ± 4 (AA) and 75 ± 6% (AA plus sal) (p < 0.05), whereas in the presence of PD98059, cell viability increased to 63 ± 6 (AA) and 78 ± 7% (AA plus sal) (p < 0.05), respectively. Wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor used at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μm, failed to prevent AA- or AA plus sal-induced toxicity. SB203580, PD98059, or wortmannin had no effect on cell viability; neither did the Me2SO (0.6%) solvent control. Human hepatocyte cultures were treated with AA or AA plus sal in the presence or absence of SB203580, PD98059, or wortmannin for 24 h. AA (60 μm) or AA plus 5 mm sal caused a 50 ± 4 or 84 ± 1% loss of cell viability, respectively (Fig. 2). SB203580 lowered toxicity to 23 ± 7 or 50 ± 2% (p < 0.05), whereas PD98059 lowered toxicity to 36 ± 4 or 63 ± 10% (p < 0.05), respectively. Wortmannin failed to prevent AA- or AA plus sal-induced toxicity in human hepatocyte cultures (p > 0.05, Fig. 2). Generally, with both PY rat hepatocytes and the human hepatocytes, SB203580 was more effective than PD98059 in preventing the CYP2E1 plus AA toxicity. Changes in the level of CYP2E1 could be one mechanism by which SB203580 protects against AA toxicity in the hepatocytes or E47 cells. Pyrazole-induced rat hepatocytes were incubated with 10 μm SB203580 for 1 or 2 days, and levels of CYP2E1 were determined by Western blot analysis. The immunoblots showed the expected decrease in CYP2E1 levels when hepatocytes are placed in culture (30Wu D. Clejan L.A. Potter B. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 2, and6). SB203580 did not lower CYP2E1 protein levels as compared with control incubations (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 8); actually, CYP2E1 levels were increased, but this increase was due to the Me2SO solvent used to solubilize the SB203580 (Fig. 3,lanes 5 and 9). Me2SO is a CYP2E1 ligand that protects against CYP2E1 degradation. This suggests that SB203580 prevention of AA- or AA plus sal-induced toxicity in hepatocytes is not mediated via lowering the levels of CYP2E1. As previously shown (19Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), salicylate helped to partially maintain CYP2E1 levels at 24 h in the tissue culture (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 7 with lanes 2 and 6), and this maintenance was not altered by SB203580 (not shown). Treating the cells with AA increased lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes about 2-fold, and this was further elevated in the presence of salicylate (Fig. 4 A). Salicylate alone, as previously shown (19Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), had no effect on lipid peroxidation. Antioxidants such as Trolox, which prevent the AA-induced lipid peroxidation, were previously shown to protect against the AA toxicity (29Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1420-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); hence, if SB203580 had any antioxidant action, its ability to prevent lipid peroxidation could explain its protective effects against AA-induced toxicity. However, SB203580, PD98059, or wortmannin (or Me2SO) did not reduce lipid peroxidation induced by AA or AA plus sal (Fig. 4 A). To further exclude a possible antioxidant effect of SB203580, we incubated rat liver microsomes with Me2SO, Me2SO plus SB203580, or, as a positive control, the antioxidant Trolox (100 μm) and determined lipid peroxidation (Fig. 4 B). SB203580 did not affect lipid peroxidation of rat microsomes compared with its Me2SO solvent control. In contrast, Trolox completely inhibited the lipid peroxidation (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that the prevention by SB203580 of AA- or AA plus sal-induced toxicity is not mediated by an antioxidant action that lowers lipid peroxidation. Mitochondria appear to be a critical target for damage by AA as well as a major organelle for the production of reactive oxygen species. AA was previously shown to decrease MMP, a decrease that was intensified by salicylate; moreover, cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition protected against AA or AA plus salicylate toxicity (29Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1420-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to study whether the inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 could protect against the AA or AA plus sal reduction of the MMP. Cells were treated with AA or AA plus sal in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors for 24 h, and the cells were then treated with Rh123 for 1 h. Flow cytometry was carried out to determine the extent of Rh123 fluorescence, an index of the MMP. The percentage of cells with low Rh123 fluorescence (M1 population; reflective of low MMP) was increased from 12 to 31% by AA or to 49% by AA plus sal (Fig. 5). However, in the presence of SB203580, the decline of MMP was prevented as the cells with low MMP decreased to 10% (AA) or 16% (AA plus sal) (p < 0.05, Fig. 5). PD98059 showed only a modest prevention effect (21% or 33% M1 cells), whereas wortmannin had no protective effect against the decline in MMP produced by AA or AA plus salicylate (Fig. 5). The prevention of AA toxicity by SB203580 suggests a role for p38 MAPK in the overall toxicity mechanism of AA. One method to assess activation of p38 MAPK is by determining its extent of phosphorylation. Treatment of rat hepatocytes with AA, sal, or AA plus sal significantly increased the level of phosphorylated p38 MAPK. After 20-min treatment with AA, sal, or AA plus sal, the extent of p38 MAPK phosphorylation increased 2.6-, 2.9-, or 5.2-fold, respectively (Fig. 6 A,lanes 4, 2, and 5, compared withlane 1, respectively), whereas the extent of phosphorylation increased 3.1-, 3.7-, or 3.9-fold, respectively, after 30-min incubation (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4, 2, and 5 compared with lane 1, respectively). AA or AA plus sal did not activate p38 MAPK phosphorylation activity after 30-min treatment in saline hepatocytes with lower levels of CYP2E1 (data not shown). AA, sal, or AA plus sal also induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation in human hepatocyte cultures (Fig. 6 B,top panels, lanes 4, 2, and 5 compared with lane 1, respectively). The ratio of phosphorylated p38 MAPK to total p38 MAPK was increased to values of 2.7, 2.1, and 4.2 after 30-min treatment with salicylate, AA, or AA plus salicylate, respectively, over the control values of 1.0. In contrast to p38 MAPK, AA or AA plus salicylate did not promote the phosphorylation of either ERK or PI3K in PY hepatocytes (data not shown) or human h"

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 645-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). CD8, by binding to the constant domain of MHC class I molecules, can increase the avidity of TCR-ligand binding but can also act as an adhesion molecule and strengthen CTL-target cell conjugate formation (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 645-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 2Konig R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Wang J.H. Reinherz E.L. Mol. Imunol. 2002; 38: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The coordinate binding of CD8 to TCR-associated MHC molecules brings CD8-associated Lck to TCR/CD3, which promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, which is an initial crucial event of TCR-mediated T-cell activation (1Janeway Jr., C.A.

Nature. 1995; 373: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The CD8 binding site on MHC class I molecules contains an acidic loop (residues 222–229), and charge inversion in position 227 (e.g.KdD227K) impairs CD8 binding by about 85% (3Wang J.H. Reinherz E.L. Mol. Imunol. 2002; 38: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Luescher I.F. Vivier E. Layer A. Mahiou J. Godeau F. Malissen B. Romero P. Nature. 1995; 373: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The recognition of sensitized target cells by CD8+ CTLs involves rapid and avid conjugate formation, followed by CTL degranulation in the contact zone, resulting in perforin/granzyme-mediated target cell killing (5Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). With a slower kinetic, CTLs also express surface Fas ligand, which, by interacting with Fas on other cells, induces Fas-mediated cytotoxicity (5Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 6Lenardo M. Chan K.M. Hornung F. McFarland H. Siegel R. Wang J. Zheng L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Although perforin-mediated cytotoxicity and Fas-mediated cytotoxicity are both induced by TCR triggering, the activation requirements are very different. For example, certain altered peptide ligands that are unable to elicit perforin-dependent cytotoxicity or cytokine production can efficiently induce Fas-mediated killing (7Cao W.S. Tykodi S. Esser M.T. Braciale V.L. Braciale T.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Kessler B. Hudrisier D. Schroeter M. Tschopp J. Cerottini J.C. Luescher I.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6939-6946PubMed Google Scholar). We observed previously that blocking of CD8 greatly impairs calcium mobilization, degranulation of CTL, and IFN-γ release but has no effect on Fas-dependent cytotoxicity (8Kessler B. Hudrisier D. Schroeter M. Tschopp J. Cerottini J.C. Luescher I.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6939-6946PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that antigen-presenting cells or microspheres expressing MHC-peptide complexes with ablated CD8 binding selectively induce F as-mediated apoptosis of CTLs (9Xu X.N. Purbhoo M.A. Chen N. Mongkolsapaya J. Cox J.H. Meier U.C. Tafuro S. Dunbar P.R. Sewell A.K. Hourigan C.S. Appay V. Cerundolo V. Burrows S.R. McMichael A.J. Screaton G.R. Immunity. 2001; 14: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The idea of eradicating antigen-specific CD8+ T cells or thymocytes via Fas-dependent apoptosis is attractive because it takes place in the absence of full, potentially harmful T-cell activation. Because in vivo application of blocking CD8 by antibodies or the use of MHC-peptide-coated microspheres is risky, we investigated here whether soluble MHC-peptide complexes with impaired CD8 binding can be used to the same end. Soluble fluorescence-labeled MHC class I-peptide multimers, so-called “tetramers,” are widely used for the detection and isolation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (10McMichael A.J. O'Callaghan C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 11Burrows S.R. Kienzle N. Winterhalter A. Bharadwaj M. Altman J.D. Brooks A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6229-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The conventional way to prepare such molecules involves enzymatic biotinylation of an added C-terminal biotinylation sequence (BSP) with the biotin ligase BirA (12O'Callaghan C.A. Byford M.F. Wyer J.R. Willcox B.E. Jakobsen B.K. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The biotinylated MHC-peptide monomers are then reacted with phycoerythrin (PE)- or allophyco-cyanin-labeled avidin derivatives. Although PE and allophyco-cyanin have very high fluorescence intensities, their conjugates with avidin are heterogeneous. Because of their large size, their conjugation with streptavidin yields ill-defined mixtures of conjugates with different stoichiometries and configurations (the molecular mass of PE is about 240,000 Da, the molecular mass of allophyco-cyanin is about 104,000 Da, and the molecular mass of streptavidin is about 60,000 Da). In consequence, saturation of such conjugates with biotinylated MHC-peptide complexes results in heterogeneous MHC- peptide complexes, referred to as multimers. To prepare well-defined soluble MHC class I-peptide complexes of different sizes, we introduced by point mutation a free cysteine at the C terminus of the MHC heavy chain, which can be alkylated with biotin containing iodoacetamide or maleimide derivatives. For oligomerization, we used homogeneous streptavidin conjugates containing the low molecular weight fluorochrome Cychrome Cy5. By using a branched peptide containing one biotin and two maleimide moieties (DMGS), this strategy allows the preparation of octameric MHC class I-peptide complexes. Here we describe the preparation of well-defined soluble tetrameric and octameric MHC-peptide complexes that co-engage or do not co-engage CD8 and their ability to activate perforin- and Fas-dependent cytotoxicity on cloned T1 CTLs. T1 CTLs recognize the PbCS peptide 252–260 (SYIPSAEKI) containing photoreactive 4-azidobenzoic acid on Lys259 (PbCS(ABA)) in the context of Kd (4Luescher I.F. Vivier E. Layer A. Mahiou J. Godeau F. Malissen B. Romero P. Nature. 1995; 373: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,13Luescher I.F. Anjuere F. Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel V.C. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Immunity. 1995; 3: 51-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We find that the binding of tetrameric but not octameric or multimeric Kd-PbCS(ABA) complexes to T1 CTLs is greatly reduced when CD8 co-engagement is ablated by the charge inversion Kd-D227K. Although Kd-D227K-PbCS(ABA) complexes fail to elicit significant tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium mobilization, and degranulation, they efficiently induced Fas-dependent cytotoxicity. The branched DMGS-biotin peptide was synthesized using conventional solid phase Fmoc strategy. Biotin was introduced by using Fmoc-K(εAhx-biotin) (Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland). The deprotected GS-biotin peptide was purified by GFC on a Superdex peptide column (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Biosciences) and reacted withN-γ-maleimidobutyryloxysuccinimide ester (GMBS; Pierce) in DMSO containing 1% di-isopropyl-ethylamine. The resulting di-maleimide conjugate was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 reverse phase column (2 × 30 m; Machery & Nagel, Oensingen, Switzerland). The column was eluted with 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid and a linear gradient of acetonitril rising in 1 h from 0 to 75%. The DMGS-biotin peptide eluted at 26.4 min, and the mono-maleimide derivative eluted at 25.3 min. All products had the correct molecular weight as assessed by mass spectrometry. Iodoacetyl-PEO-biotin was from Pierce, and SYIPSAEK(ABA)I (PbCS(ABA)) was prepared by the conventional solid phase Fmoc strategy using Fmoc-Lys(ABA) (Bachem) following previously published procedures (13Luescher I.F.

Cerottini J.C. Luescher I.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 553-562PubMed Google Scholar). Cloned T1 CTLs were cultured and used as described previously (13Luescher I.F. Anjuere F. Peitsch M.C.

Luescher I.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 553-562PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the CTLs were restimulated weekly using γ-irradiated PbCS(ABA) pulsed P815 cells and Balb/c feeder cells and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5 nm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 30 units/ml recombinant interleukin 2. Normal and Fas-transfected mastocytoma P815 cells were cultured and used as described previously (8Kessler B. Hudrisier D. Schroeter M. Tschopp J. Cerottini J.C. Luescher I.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6939-6946PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: Cy5-labeled annexin V and anti-Fas antibody were from BD Biosciences, anti-CD8β mAb H35 and anti-TCRCβ mAb H57 were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), anti-phospho-tyrosine mAb 4G10 was from Upstate Biologicals (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-CD3ε antibody M-20 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All stainings for FACS were performed at 4 °C for 30–60 min. The cDNA encoding the Kd heavy chain was cloned into the pET3a vector by PCR amplification, using primers 5′-GCCATATGGGCCCACATTCGCTGAG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GCGGATCCTCAAGCCAGCTTCCATCTCA-3′ (reverse primer). The restriction sites NdeI and BamHI used for cloning are underlined. A free cysteine was introduced by point mutation in positions 273, 275, and 277 (R273C, K275C, and A277C) of the Kd heavy chain, using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For PCR amplification, the following primers were used: 5′-GAGCCTCTCACCCTGTGCTGGAAGCTGGCTTGA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TCAAGCCAGCTTCCAGCACAGGGTGAGAGGCTC-3′ (reverse primer), 5′-CCTCTCACCCTGAGATGGTGCCTGGCTTGAGGATCCGGC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GCCGGATCCTCAAGCCAGGCACCATCTCAGGGTGAGAGG-3′ (reverse primer), 5′-CCCTGAGATGGAAGCTGTGTTGAGGATCCGGCTGC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GCAGCCGGATCCTCAACACAGCTTCCATCTCAGGG-3′ (reverse primer). The codons in italics indicate the introduced cysteine. After digestion of the parental DNA template with DpnI, the mutated strands were transformed in BL21 DE3 pLysS bacteria. For expression of recombinant Kd heavy chain and human β2m, BL21 DE3 pLysS bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The expression of the recombinant proteins was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm,final concentration). The recombinant proteins were produced as insoluble inclusion bodies and extracted as described previously (15Garboczi D.N. Hung D.T. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3429-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). As judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, the purity of both proteins was 80–90%. Aliquots of these solutions were stored at −80 °C. Kd-BSP heavy chain and human β2m were refolded in the presence of the peptide using the dilution method essentially as described previously (15Garboczi D.N. Hung D.T. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3429-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In brief, the Kdheavy chain- and β2m-containing urea solutions were added at 4 °C under agitation within 2 h in a 100-fold larger volume of refolding buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 400 mml-arginine, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmglutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 5 μm of the specific peptide. After stirring for 72 h at 4 °C, insoluble components were removed by filtration on 0.2 μm membrane filters (Nalgene), and the mixture was concentrated about 40-fold on an Amicon ultrafiltration concentrator equipped with a polyethersulfone membrane (M r 10,000 cutoff; Amicon). The concentrate was passed over a 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) in Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and the Kd-PbCS(ABA) monomers were purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Source Q15 fast flow column (AmershamBiosciences). The column was eluted in the same buffer with a NaCl gradient rising in 60 min from 0 to 500 mm. The average refolding efficiency for the PbCS(ABA) peptide was 20%, with 100% being the amount of Kd heavy chain invested. The purified Kd-peptide complexes were supplemented with 2 mm glutathione, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 μg/ml β2m. The enzymatic biotinylation of Kd-peptide-BSP was performed overnight at 25 °C with ATP, biotin, and the biotin ligase BirA as described previously (12O'Callaghan C.A. Byford M.F. Wyer J.R. Willcox B.E. Jakobsen B.K. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For alkylation, the Kd-peptide complexes (1 mg/ml) were incubated in Tris buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h at 4 °C with 15 mm glutathione to reduce the C-terminal free cysteine. After GFC over a Superdex S75 column (1 × 30 cm; Pharmacia), the reduced monomers were reacted in Tris buffer containing 5 mm EDTA with a 5-fold molar excess of alkylation reagent under argon overnight at 4 °C. The alkylated Kd-peptide complexes were purified by gel filtration on a Superdex S75 column. Dimeric Kd-DMGS-biotin complexes were obtained by reacting monomeric Kd-DMGS-biotin with a 2-fold excess of Kd-cysteine monomers. Dimeric Kd-peptide complexes were separated from monomers by anion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q fast flow anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The biotinylation efficiency was determined by SDS-PAGE (15%, nondenaturing) of 5-μg aliquots of Kd-peptide complexes that were reacted or not reacted with a 2-fold molar excess of avidin (Molecular Probes). The Coomassie Blue-stained gels were evaluated by densitometry, and the alkylation efficiency, calculated as a percentage, was as follows: (amount of avidin-bound Kd-peptide-avidin)/(amount of Kd-peptide) × 100. Kd-peptide tetramers and octamers were obtained by reacting the biotinylated Kd-PbCS(ABA) complexes with Cy5-labeled streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences), and the multimers were obtained by reacting biotinylated Kd-PbCS(ABA) monomers with Extravidin-PE (Sigma) at a molar ratio of 4:1. Labeled oligomers were purified by GFC on a Superdex 200 column (1 × 30 cm; Pharmacia), which was eluted in Tris buffer (20 mm, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. For binding studies, T1 CTLs were washed with Optimem (Invitrogen) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% sodium azide, 15 mm HEPES, and 2 μg/ml human β2m. The cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 30 min with fluorescence-labeled Kd-peptide complexes in 50-μl aliquots at 18 °C or 37 °C, washed once in cold medium, and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). T1 CTLs (5 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 μg/ml human β2m and 10 μm PbCS 252–260 peptide at 37 °C with 25 nm Kd-PbCS(ABA) octamers. After three washes, the CTLs were incubated in 96-well plates (15,000 cells/well) with51Cr-labeled P815 cells (5,000 cells/well) at 37 °C for 4 h. The specific chromium release, calculated as a percentage, was as follows: (experimental release − spontaneous release)/(total release − spontaneous release) × 100. The total release was the esterase content after lysis of the cells with 1% Triton X-100. T1 CTLs were adhered in 96-well plates previously coated with super fibronectin (Sigma) and incubated in Optimem medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 μg/ml human β2m and 10 μm PbCS 252–260 peptide for 90 min with 25 nm Kd-PbCS(ABA) octamer in the absence or presence of 100 nm concanamycin A (Sigma), anti-CD8β mAb H35 (10 μg/ml), or PbCS(ABA) peptide (1 μm). Released esterases were measured in the supernatants as described previously (16Legler D.F. Doucey M.A. Cerottini J.-C. Bron C. Luescher I.F.

T1 CTLs (1 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated or not incubated with Kd-PbCS(ABA) complexes (25 nm) for 3 min at 37 °C. After washing with chilled phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed on ice for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing Brij78 (1%) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and from the detergent-soluble fraction, TCR/CD3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-TCR mAb H57. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE (15%, reducing) and Western blotted using anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 or anti-CD3ε antibody. For detection, the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection kit (ECL;Amersham Biosciences) was used as recommended by the supplier. T1 CTLs were incubated with Cy5-labeled Kd-PbCS(ABA), KdD227K-PbCS(ABA), or Kd-Cw3 170–179 octamer for 30 min at 37 °C or 18 °C. After washing, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and laid onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides for 10 min and mounted. Internalization of Cy5-conjugated octamer was analyzed by confocal microscopy on an Axiovert 100 microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a ×63 oil objective. Cy5 fluorescence was measured upon excitation with neon/helium laser at 633 nm. Each image was the average of four scans. Digital images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop. T1 CTLs (0.5 × 106cells/ml) were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 20 mm HEPES and incubated in 50-μl aliquots at 37 °C for 30 min with 25 nm Kd-PbCS(ABA), KdD227K-PbCS(ABA), or Kd-Cw3 170–179 octamers or left untreated. After one wash, the cells were incubated for 4.5 h in the same medium, stained with Cy5-labeled annexin V, and analyzed by FACS. T1 CTLs (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with 5 μm Indo-1 (Sigma) at 37 °C for 45 min, washed, and incubated at 37 °C with 25 nm Kd-peptide octamers or medium, and calcium-dependent Indo-1 fluorescence was measured by FACS on a FACStarTM as described previously (14Hudrisier D. Kessler B. Valitutti S. Horvath C. Cerottini J.C. Luescher I.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 553-562PubMed Google Scholar). We prepared and examined three different types of soluble Kd-peptide complexes: multimers, tetramers, and octamers. All complexes were produced with either wild type Kd or KdD227K, which has greatly impaired CD8 binding (4Luescher I.F. Vivier E. Layer A. Mahiou J. Godeau F. Malissen B. Romero P. Nature. 1995; 373: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Monomeric Kd-PbCS(ABA) complexes were obtained by refolding of different Kd heavy chains and human β2m in the presence of PbCS(ABA) peptide. The refolding efficiency of Kd-PbCS(ABA) complexes containing the heavy chain comprising residues 1–277 or the heavy chain containing an added BSP sequence was, on average, 20% (Fig. 1 A). The BSP-containing Kd-PbCS(ABA) complexes were biotinylated by using the biotin ligase BirA (12O'Callaghan C.A. Byford M.F. Wyer J.R. Willcox B.E. Jakobsen B.K. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the biotinylation was 70–80%, and the efficiency of the refolding of Kd-PbCS(ABA) or Kd-PbCS(ABA)-BSP complexes, on average, was 20% (Fig. 1S). Alternatively, biotinylation was accomplished by site-specific alkylation of a free cysteine introduced by point mutation at the C-terminal portion of the Kd heavy chain. To find out what position is most suitable, a free cysteine was introduced in position 273, 275, or 277 (Fig. 1 B). The former two flank the conserved Trp274, which is the last residue of the folded α3 domain of MHC class I molecules (17Sliz P. Michielin O. Cerottini J.-C. Luescher I.F. Romero P. Karplus M. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3276-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Refolding under the same conditions gave yields of 14% for KdK275C, 12% for KdR273C, and 6% for KdA277C (Fig. 1S,A). The refolding efficiency of KdK275C was increased to 20% when 0.3 mm dithiothreitol was added to the urea buffer. The alkylation efficiency of the different Kd-PbCS(ABA) cysteine mutants was assessed after incubation at 4 °C overnight with a 5-fold molar excess of iodoacetyl-PEO-biotin (Fig. 1 C). The alkylation efficiency was 16% for KdR273C, 24% for KdK275C, and 12% for KdA277C (Fig. 1S, B). Based on these results, KdK275C was selected. Its alkylation efficiency was increased to about 80% upon reduction of KdK275C-PbCS(ABA) complexes with 15 mm glutathione before the alkylation (Fig1S, C). The alkylation was selective for the free cysteine because Kd-PbCS(ABA) wild type complexes were not significantly alkylated (Fig. 1S, B and C). A slightly higher alkylation efficiency (about 85%) was obtained for the mono-alkylation of KdK275C-PbCS(ABA) complexes with bi-malemide-biotin reagent DMGS-biotin (Fig. 1 D). The purified mono-alkylated Kd-DMGS-biotin complexes were then reacted with a 2-fold molar excess of reduced KdK275C-PbCS(ABA). The efficiency for this reaction was 60–70%. Together, these results show that KdK275C can be refolded and biotinylated by alkylation with the same efficiencies as by the BSP/BirA strategy. The same findings were obtained for HLA-A2 (data not shown). Defined Kd-peptide tetramers and octamers were obtained by reacting Kd-peptide-PEO-biotin and dimeric Kd-peptide-DMGS-biotin complexes with homogeneous Cy5-labeled streptavidin. For multimeric Kd-peptide complexes, Kd-BSP-biotin-peptide monomers were reacted with heterogeneous PE-extravidin. The different compounds were analyzed by gel filtration on a Superdex S200 column and anion exchange chromatography on a Source 15Q column, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the Kd-PbCS(ABA) monomers, dimers, tetramers, and octamers were homogenous, except for some minor contaminants, and eluted in both types of chromatography as expected. By contrast, the PE-labeled Kd-PbCS(ABA) multimers eluted in a heterogeneous manner from the anion exchange column. The majority of the PE-labeled Kd-PbCS(ABA) multimers eluted from the Superdex S200 column at around 10 min, i.e. in the void volume. Because the size exclusion of this column is aboutM r 600,000, and PE-extravidin Kd-peptide tetramers have a M r of about 470,000, this preparation contained mainly conjugates that were larger than tetramers containing one PE. In agreement with this is the late elution of these complexes from the anion exchange column. The same results were obtained for the Kd-peptide complexes containing the D227K mutation (data not shown). To study the binding of Cy5-labeled Kd-peptide complexes, we first measured the binding kinetics of the Kd-PbCS(ABA) octamers and multimers. As shown in Fig. 3, A–D, the binding of both complexes was rapid at 37 °C, 18 °C, and 4 °C, with ≥90% of maximal binding reached within the first few minutes of incubation. For octamer at 37 °C (Fig. 3 A), but not at 18 °C or 4 °C (Fig. 3, C and D), a transient binding maximum was observed at about 10 min, followed by a modest decrease, to reach a stable plateau after 1 h. A similar biphasic binding kinetics was recorded at 37 °C for Kd-PbCS(ABA) monomer and tetramer (data not shown) (4Luescher I.F. Vivier E. Layer A. Mahiou J. Godeau F. Malissen B. Romero P. Nature. 1995; 373: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In all cases, the binding of noncognate Kd-Cw3 170–179 octamer or multimer was no more than a few percent of the binding of the corresponding cognate complexes, indicating that nonspecific binding, namely, binding to CD8 under these conditions, is insignificant. We next assessed the binding isotherms at 37 °C and 18 °C for the compounds under study (Fig. 3, E–H). At 37 °C, the binding of Cy5-labeled Kd-PbCS(ABA) octamers increased steeply in the concentration range of up to 30 nm and then gradually up to 100 nm, the highest concentration tested (Fig. 3 E). By contrast, for the tetramer, much lower levels of binding were observed, and the increase in binding required higher concentrations. For the corresponding Kd-D227K-PbCS(ABA) complexes, the binding of the octamer was reduced by about 10%, but binding of the tetramer was close to the background binding observed for the noncognate Kd-Cw3 171–179 peptide complexes. A similar binding pattern was observed at 18 °C, except that nearly maximal binding was reached already at 12.5 nm for the octamer and at 30 nm for the tetramer (Fig. 3 G). This difference seems mainly accounted for by endocytosis, which is taking place at 37 °C, but not at 18 °C (see below). The binding of PE-labeled multimers increased continuously over the range of concentrations tested at 37 °C (Fig. 3 F) and at 18 °C (Fig. 3 H). Strikingly, at both temperatures, Kd wild type and Kd-D227K complexes exhibited about the same binding patterns. Because these multimer complexes contain higher order complexes (see above), these results argue that the CD8 dependence of the binding of MHC-peptide complexes decreases as their valence increases. Essentially the same findings were obtained on the PbCS(ABA)-specific S14 CTL clone. To assess whether octamers induce down-modulation of TCR and CD8, T1 CTLs were incubated with saturating concentrations of Kd-PbCS(ABA) and KdD227K-PbCS(ABA) octamers for different periods of time, and TCR and CD8 expression was measured by FACS. At 4 °C, the surface expression of TCR and CD8 remained essentially unchanged (Fig. 4,A and B). At 18 °C, a scant reduction of TCR and CD8 expression was observed after 30 and 60 min of incubation (Fig. 4, C and D). At 37 °C, there was a time-dependent down-modulation of TCR and CD8 of about 40% after 1 h of incubation with Kd-PbCS(ABA) octamer (Fig. 4 E). The KdD227K octamer induced the same TCR down-modulation, but the down-modulation of CD8 was less than half (18% after 1 h; Fig. 4 F). To visualize endocytosis of Cy5-labeled Kd-PbCS(ABA) and KdD227K-PbCS(ABA) octamers, they w"

Studying G-protein regulation of either native GIRK (IKACh) channels in feline atrial myocytes or heterologously expressed GIRK1/4 channels in Chinese hamster ovary cells and HEK 293 cells uncovered a novel Gβγ subunit mediated regulation of the inwardly rectifying properties of these channels. IKACh activated by submaximal concentrations of acetylcholine exhibited a ∼2.5-fold stronger inward rectification than IKACh activated by saturating concentrations of acetylcholine. Similarly, the inward rectification of currents through GIRK1/4 channels expressed in HEK cells was substantially weakened upon maximal stimulation with co-expressed Gβγ subunits. Analysis of the outward current block underlying inward rectification demonstrated that the fraction of instantaneously blocked channels was reduced when Gβγ was over-expressed. The Gβγ induced weakening of inward rectification was associated with reduced potencies for Ba2+ and Cs+ to block channels from the extracellular side. Based on these results we propose that saturation of the channel with Gβγ leads to a conformational change within the pore of the channel that reduced the potency of extracellular cations to block the pore and increased the fraction of channels inert to a pore block in outward direction.

G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channels Chinese hamster ovary adenosine acetylcholine M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors adrenergic receptor transmembrane domain 2 G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs)1 are expressed in many areas of the brain and in supraventricular myocytes of the heart (1Sakmann B.

Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors that couple to Gi-proteins such as the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M2-mAChRs) lead to a dissociation of heterotrimeric G-proteins into activated α subunits and βγ dimers. Gβγ subunits are known to bind to GIRK channels and increase the open probability of these channels (3Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol.

Cross-linking studies have demonstrated that the heterotetrameric channel can bind up to 4 Gβγ subunits (9Corey S. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11409-11413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, despite much experimental effort the mechanism by which Gβγ activates these channels is not well understood. GIRK channels belong to the family of strong inwardly rectifying K+ channels, which are characterized by their strong inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationships. The inward rectification has been linked to the presence of intracellular Mg2+ and polyamines (10Fakler B. Brandle U. Glowatzki E. Weidemann S. Zenner H.P. Ruppersberg J.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 149-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 11Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev.

These positively charged cytoplasmic ions are thought to block outward K+ currents by blocking the pore of channels from the inside (10Fakler B. Brandle U. Glowatzki E. Weidemann S. Zenner H.P. Ruppersberg J.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 149-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 11Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev.

Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9289-9294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); however, for a related inwardly rectifying channel Kir2.1 this hypothesis has recently been questioned (14Lee J.K. John S.A. Weiss J.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Inward rectification of K+ channels is not only voltage-dependent but also dependent on the extracellular K+ concentration (11Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The inward rectification of these K+ channels is closely related to their function in the heart as well as in many neuronal tissues. In cardiac myocytes activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels such as IKACh causes the cell membrane to hyperpolarize between action potentials because the conductivity for K+ generated by these channels is high at membrane potentials close to E K. This hyperpolarization induced by IKACh appears to be at least partially responsible for the negative chronotropic effect induced by vagal activity (1Sakmann B. Noma A. Trautwein W. Nature. 1983; 303: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 2Wickman K. Krapivinsky G. Corey S. Kennedy M. Nemec J. Medina I. Clapham D.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

During action potentials, however, the conductivity of IKACh for K+ declines several-fold with the rise of voltage enabling the myocyte to generate prolonged action potentials, which are critically important for cardiac function (16Nichols C.G. Makhina E.N. Pearson W.L. Sha Q. Lopatin A.N. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The initial observation that led to the study presented here was the discovery that the agonist-induced IKACh in cardiac myocytes were quite variable in their degree of inward rectification, 2M. Bünemann, unpublished observations. indicating that the modulation of the open probability of these channels (15Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-760PubMed Google Scholar) by ACh may not be the only property of these channels that is regulated by ACh. It seemed possible that, in addition, inward rectification of these channels may be modulated as well by ACh. The present experiments have tested this possibility. Isolation of feline atrial myocytes was performed as described (17Harvey R.D. Ten Eick R.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Animal procedures used were in accordance with guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern University. Briefly, adult cats were first anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (70 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally). The heart was quickly removed and retrograde perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. It was digested by perfusion with collagenase-containing solution. After 10–15 min of digestion the atria were collected and cut into small pieces, followed by a 5-min incubation with fresh enzyme solution. Isolated atrial myocytes were collected, placed in M199 (Invitrogen), and plated in cell culture dishes. The cells were kept at 37 °C under 7% CO2 until further use. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen). The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and streptomycin/penicillin (100 units each). Cells were grown under 7% CO2 at 37 °C. In all transfections for electrophysiological studies the CD8 reporter gene system was used to visualize transfected cells (18Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y.

CHO-K1 cells were transfected using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer (19Forsayeth J.R. Garcia P.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17 (, 357–358,): 354-356PubMed Google Scholar) using the following amounts of endotoxin-free cDNAs (Qiagen)/6 cm dish: human CD8 (in π3; 0.15 μg; gift from Dr. G.

Empty pcDNA3 was used to balance the total amount of cDNA used for transfection to 2–2.35 mg/6 cm. All assays were performed 48–72 h post transfection if not otherwise mentioned. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin/penicillin (100 units each), and 1% glutamine. Cells were grown under 7% CO2 at 37 °C. In cells stably expressing GIRK1/4, the media was supplemented with 200 mg/l G418. To visualize transfected cells the CD8 reporter gene system was used as described before. Transfection was performed using the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol using the following amounts of endotoxin-free cDNAs (Qiagen)/6 cm dish.

Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7: HEK cells stably expressing GIRK1 and GIRK4 channels were transfected with 0.7 μg α2a-AR-Gαi1, 1.4 μg each of human Gβ1 and Gγ2 (in pCDNA3), and CD8 (in π3, 0.2 μg). Experiments were performed 40–50 h post transfection.Figure 5The slow component of outward current block is not altered by co-expression of Gβγ subunits. Illustrated are representative current recordings measured in response to voltage steps (−120 mV, 60 mV, and −120 mV, as indicated) from cells, which did (red) or did not express exogenous Gβγ (black). Currents were normalized either to the maximal inward (upper and lower right panel) or outward (lower left panel) currents, and the time course of the onset of outward current block (lower left panel) as well as the recovery from outward current block (lower right panel) was fitted best by a bi-exponential decay.

Curve fitting using conventional dose-response equations (Origin 6.1 software) determined the concentration for half-maximal inhibition of GIRK currents to be 30 μm Ba2+for agonist-activated (strong inward rectifying) currents and 70 μm for Gβ1γ2-activated currents.

The internal (pipette) solution contained (mm): potassium aspartate, 100; KCl, 40; MgATP, 5; Hepes-KOH, 10; NaCl, 5; EGTA, 2; MgCl2, 1; GTP, 0.01; pH 7.3. All standard salts as well as ACh and adenosine (Ado) were purchased either from Sigma or from Merck.

Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). Patch-pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries, (GF-150–10, Warner Instrument Corp.) using a horizontal puller (P-95, Fleming & Poulsen). The DC resistance of the filled pipettes ranged from 3–6 MΩ. Membrane currents were recorded using either a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200, Axon Instruments) or an EPC 9 (HEKA Instruments) as described previously (21Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

Data were digitally stored using either a Mac (Centrion 640 with pulse software) or an IBM compatible PC equipped with a hardware/software package (ISO2 by MFK, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) for voltage control, data acquisition, and data evaluation. IKACh was measured as an inward current using a holding potential of −90 mV as described (23Bünemann M. Brandts B. zu Heringdorf D.M. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. Pott L. J. Physiol. 1995; 489: 701-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Voltage ramps (from −120 mV to +60 mV in 500 ms, every 10 s) were used to determine current-voltage (I-V) relationships. All measurements were performed at room temperature. Summarized results are presented as mean values ± S.E. Student's t tests (two population) were performed to test for significance of differences between groups of data. The atrial muscarinic K+ current (IKACh) is regulated by muscarinic receptors, and the underlying pathway has been studied in detail by many groups (15Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-760PubMed Google Scholar). The inwardly rectifying properties of this channel have been the topic of many detailed studies that provided interesting insights into the mechanisms of inward rectification (10Fakler B. Brandle U. Glowatzki E. Weidemann S. Zenner H.P. Ruppersberg J.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 149-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 11Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). However, so far no physiological modulation of the inward rectification of this current has been reported. The following study was based on the surprising observation that the inward rectification of ACh-evoked K+ currents in feline atrial myocytes varied as a function of the agonist concentration. IKACh in isolated feline atrial myocytes was measured in response to two different concentrations of ACh either in the inward or outward direction using the whole cell patch technique. The membrane potential was clamped to either −90 mV or +60 mV in the presence of 20 mmextracellular K+. When the holding potential was negative (−90 mV) to the potassium equilibrium potential (E K) (Fig. 1 A), superfusion of the cell with 0.1 μm ACh gave rise to inward currents that were about 70% in amplitude compared with currents activated by 10 μm ACh. In contrast, at +60 mV outward currents induced by 0.1 μm ACh were barely detectable and were only about 10% in amplitude compared with currents activated by 10 μm ACh. I-V curves of ACh-induced currents (Fig. 1 B) were determined by subtracting currents measured in the absence of agonist from currents measured in the presence of agonist in response to linear voltage ramps from −120 mV to +60 mV. I-V curves of the currents elicited by 0.1 μm ACh or by 10 μm ACh exhibited inward rectification and identical reversal potentials close to the E K (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the currents generated by either concentration of ACh were attributable to activation of IKACh. However, inward rectification of the current activated by 0.1 μm ACh was found to be considerably stronger than that of the current activated by 10 μm(Fig. 1 B). Plotting GIRK conductance (normalized to the amplitude measured at −90 mV) against voltage shows a 15–20 mV shift to more positive potentials when currents were activated by 10 μm compared with 0.1 μm ACh (Fig. 1 C). Whole cell currents were measured in CHO-K1 or HEK 293 cells transfected with GIRK 1 and 4 as described before to prove that GIRK channels are responsible for the observed currents in feline atrial myocytes (21Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31186-31190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Bünemann M. Meyer T. Pott L. Hosey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12537-12545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Gi-coupled receptors such as the M2-mAChR or A1 adenosine receptors activated GIRK currents in response to agonist (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the size of the currents increased as a function of agonist concentration (Fig. 2 A), no stimulus-dependent change in inward rectification of GIRK currents was observed (Fig. 2 B). Indeed, agonist-induced currents all exhibited strong inward rectification very similar to atrial IKACh activated with low doses of agonist (compare Figs. 2 B and1 B). Similar results were observed in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells using M2-mAChR, A1adenosine receptors, or α2A adrenergic receptors (data not shown and Refs. 21Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31186-31190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and 22Bünemann M. Bücheler M.M. Philipp M. Lohse M.J. Hein L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47512-47517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced GIRK currents obtained from cells heterologously transfected with GIRK1/4 were activated via endogenous G-proteins (Fig. 2, A and B). It seemed likely that the pool of endogenous G-proteins might have been limiting for the extent of maximal GIRK current activation. Therefore, Gβ1γ2 subunits were co-expressed with GIRK channels. GIRK currents were constitutively active due to Gβγ subunits. The amplitude of GIRK currents was determined via inhibition by Ba2+ (Fig. 2 C). In most cases, activation of co-expressed A1 adenosine receptors by 10 μmAdo induced no further stimulation of Ba2+-sensitive GIRK currents, indicating a maximal stimulation of GIRK channels by Gβγ. Under these conditions, total Ba2+-sensitive GIRK currents compared with control conditions (activation via receptor and endogenous G-proteins) were about 2-fold larger in amplitude (147 ± 12.7 pA/pF with co-expressed Gβ1γ2 versus 71.2 ± 20.7 pA/pF activated via A1 adenosine receptors and endogenous G-proteins) and exhibited a weaker inward rectification (Fig. 2 D versus Fig. 2 B). Comparing the conductance-voltage relationship revealed a shift to more positive voltages for GIRK currents activated by heterologously expressed Gβγ subunits compared with GIRK currents activated by agonist only (Fig. 2 E). To quantify the relative inward rectification of GIRK currents the ratio of GIRK current conductance in outwardversus inward direction (Ba2+-sensitive GIRK currents at reversal potential (E rev) ± 50 mV) was calculated. The ratio of outward/inward currents of Ba2+-sensitive GIRK currents activated by heterologously expressed Gβγ was significantly increased compared with Ba2+-sensitive GIRK currents activated via A1 adenosine receptors and endogenous G-proteins (0.39 ± 0.11, n = 9 versus 0.14 ± 0.05,n = 8) (Fig. 2 F). The voltage-dependence of GIRK currents maximally activated by heterologous expression of Gβγ was comparable with atrial IKACh activated by saturating concentrations of ACh (10 μm), whereas agonist-induced GIRK currents activated via endogenous G-proteins exhibited similar strong inward rectification as submaximally activated atrial IKACh. This result indicated that the inwardly rectifying properties of GIRK channels were modulated depending on the internal Gβγ concentration. In a minority of cells transfected with Gβγ subunits addition of adenosine to stimulate A1 adenosine receptors resulted in a further increase in GIRK currents (Fig. 3 A), indicating submaximal stimulation of GIRK channels by heterologously expressed Gβγ. Under these circumstances, basal Gβγ-induced GIRK currents exhibited strong inward rectification, whereas addition of adenosine resulted in a pronounced weakening of inward rectification (Fig. 3 B), demonstrating that inward rectification of heterologously expressed GIRK currents can be modulated via stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors similar to atrial myocytes. Taken together, these results suggested that Gβγ at submaximal concentrations induces strong inwardly rectifying GIRK currents, whereas at maximal concentrations, Gβγ-evoked GIRK currents exhibited weakened inward rectification. If the ratio of GIRK channels versus available Gβγ in the cells is important for the degree of inward rectification as suggested by these results, it should be possible to achieve a high ratio of endogenous Gβγ to GIRK channels by lowering the GIRK channel expression. Contrarily, a strengthening of the inward rectification should occur when GIRK channel expression is increased relative to the Gβγ expression. We attempted to counteract the Gβγ mediated weakening of inward rectification by transfecting HEK 293 cells with steady amounts of Gβγ subunits but increasing amounts of GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits as illustrated in Fig. 4. Gβγ expression in the presence of co-expressed GIRK channels decreased cell survival. Therefore, we choose to co-express an α2A-adrenergic receptor fused to a Giα1-protein (26Burt A.R. Sautel M. Wilson M.A. Rees S. Wise A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10367-10375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to reduce constituitive Gβγ signals. GIRK channels were stimulated using saturating concentrations of norepinephrine (10 μm), and subsequently GIRK currents were blocked by superfusion of the cells with 1 mm BaCl2 to determine background currents. The ratio of outward to inward GIRK currents significantly declined with increasing amounts of GIRK channels transfected (Fig. 4,upper panel). The GIRK current density measured at −90 mV increased with increasing amounts of GIRK1/4 channel expression (Fig. 4, lower panel), suggesting that Gβγ expression was not limiting for maximal inward GIRK currents in cells transfected with 0.1 μg cDNA/5 cm dish of GIRK1/4. These results supported the hypothesis that inward rectification of GIRK channels is modulated dependent on the ratio of Gβγ subunits relative to GIRK channels. In addition, we tried to lower GIRK expression relative to endogenous G-proteins by prolonging the time after transfection and found a significant increase in the ratio of outward to inward currents from day 3 to 4 post-transfection in transiently transfected CHO cells (Iout/Iin: 0.22 ± 0.06 d.4versus 0.095 ± 0.025 d.3) accompanied by a small reduction in GIRK current density determined at −90 mV (43 ± 13 pA/pF, d.4 n = 12 compared with 64 ± 10 pA/pF, d.3 n = 6). This weakening of inward rectification of GIRK currents reflected most likely a decrease in GIRK channel expression in the individual cells, resulting in an increase of the ratio of G-proteins versus GIRK channels. For further analysis experimental conditions were chosen to consistently induce either strong inward rectifying currents (control) or weak inward rectifying currents (Gβγ-induced) in HEK cells stably expressing GIRK1 and 4. Strong inward rectifying currents were induced via agonist stimulation of α2A adrenergic receptors in the absence of exogenous Gβγ, whereas weak inward rectifying currents were evoked by additional co-transfection of Gβ1γ2. As described above the current model of the inward rectifying mechanism is a voltage-dependent open channel block by internal Mg2+ and polyamines such as spermine and spermidine. To test whether an alteration of the polyamine- and Mg2+-induced open channel block was the cause for the observed weakening of inward rectification, blocking and unblocking kinetics were determined using whole cell recording.

Therefore, whole cell currents resulting from voltage steps (−120 mV to 60 mV; 60 mV to −120 mV) were measured to determine the time constants of polyamine block onset and offset. In case inward rectification was weakened due to lowered polyamine block affinity, a faster polyamine unbinding from the channel and/or a slower-polyamine binding to the channel should be observed. In contrast, if Mg2+ block was altered, the fraction of channels blocked instantaneously in outward direction should be decreased, whereas changes in blocking and unblocking kinetics should not be observed. Background currents were determined by inhibiting GIRK channels via Ba2+ and subtracted from each measured whole cell current. A second-order exponential function was used to fit the current curves and determine time constants. Comparison of currents measured under control (str"

Biosci. 1999; 4: 270-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). I-2 appears to change the conformation of the protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit (PP1c). When I-2 is phosphorylated in an inactive PP1c·I-2 complex on Thr-72, the PP1cbecomes activated. This activation is thought to occur by the transference of a phosphorylation-dependent I-2 conformational change to PP1c. This idea is supported by data showing that phosphorylated I-2 mixed with inactive PP1c cannot activate it (3Jurgensen S. Shacter E. Huang C.Y. Chock P.B. Yang S.D. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. J.

Autodephosphorylation of phospho-I-2 within the active PP1c·I-2 complex deactivates PP1c, even though PP1c can be removed from the complex in an active state. Therefore, I-2 can both inactivate and activate PP1c by changing its conformation in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion. I-2 interaction with denatured recombinant PP1c and subsequent phosphorylation yields an active enzyme, which has inspired the notion that I-2 is a PP1c molecular chaperone (5Alessi D.R. Street A.J.

Casein kinase-2 (CK2) phosphorylates I-2 on three residues, Ser-86, Ser-120, and Ser-120, but does not change its activity. CK2 phosphorylation at these sites cooperatively enhances GSK3 phosphorylation at Thr-72 (10Wang Q. Park I.-K. Fiol C. Roach P. DePaoli-Roach A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whether any of these kinases actually phosphorylate I-2 in vivo is unknown. Glc8 is the budding yeast ortholog of I-2. Mutations in glc8were discovered because they reduce yeast glycogen accumulation (11Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glc8 inhibits mammalian PP1c and yeast PP1c, Glc7, in vitro (12Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). I-2 has several PP1c-binding sites in addition to the inhibitory region (13Yang J. Hurley T.D. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22635-22644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Alignments of I-2 and Glc8 sequences indicate that Glc8 may lack some PP1c-binding sites found in I-2. In contrast to PP1c in mammalian cells, the majority of Glc7 in yeast is bound to Sds22 (14Hong G. Trumbly R.J. Reimann E.M. Schlender K.K. Arch. Biochem.

In comparison with other yeast Glc7-binding proteins, the affinity for Glc8 is weak (16Ramaswamy N.T., Li, L. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 57-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glc7, like mammalian PP1c, regulates many physiological processes: glycogen metabolism, transcription, translation initiation, membrane fusion, sporulation, and mitosis (17Stark M.J. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1647-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In regard to its mitotic function, evidence indicates that Glc7 dephosphorylates proteins phosphorylated by the Ipl1 protein kinase, which regulates chromosome bi-orientation on the spindle (18Francisco L.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Glc8 can activate or inhibit Glc7 activity in vivo. The regulatory Thr-72 in I-2 corresponds to Glc8 Thr-118. Previous work indicated that this site must be a phosphorylatable residue forin vivo Glc8 function (12Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify the Glc8 kinase as the cyclin-dependent kinase, Pho85, which is orthologous with mammalian CDK5. We also demonstrate that Pho85 phosphorylates Glc8 in vivo and that is the sole Glc8 kinase in budding yeast. Moreover, four redundant Pho85 cyclins are required for in vivo Glc8 phosphorylation.

Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cloned into YEp352 (26Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The SalI site in p1841 comes from its YCp50 vector sequences. Plasmid p2087 was made by ligation of the SacI-SalI fragment from p1841, containing GLC8, into pTSV30A, a 2μ ADE3 LEU2plasmid from John Pringle (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). To make the GLC8 expression plasmid pPM1539, aNdeI site was created at the GLC8 initiating methionine codon by mutagenesis of single-stranded DNA from p1945 with primer 86 (5′- CATCAGACATATGGGAGG-3′, the initiating methionine codon is underlined) (27McClary J.A. Witney F. Geisselsoder J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 282-289PubMed Google Scholar). TheNdeI-HindIII GLC8 fragment was ligated into pT7–7 (28Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar), placing GLC8 behind the T7 promoter- and ribosome-binding sites. Plasmid pYT114 contains a T118Amutation in GLC8 made by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (29Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninski J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications.

Primer pair 243 (5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGA-3′) and 379 (5′-GCACCTTGGTAGGGGGCCTTG-3′) and primer pair 386 (5′-AATTCTCATGTTTGACAGCTT-3′) and 378 (5′-GCCCAAGGCCCCCTACCAAGG-3′) generated two overlapping fragments from pPM1539. These fragments, along with primers 386 and 243, were used to generate the complete T7p-GLC8-T118A-containing fragment in a subsequent PCR. AClaI-HindIII fragment from this final PCR product was cloned into pT7–7.Table IIPlasmid listNameVectorDescriptionSourcep1814YCp50CEN URA3 GLC8Ref. 11Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M.

GST fusion plasmids from original EJ758 transformant pools were retrieved by E. colitransformation. Recombinational cloning generated these plasmids and the yeast transformants contained a mixture of plasmid species (32Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose an individual, isolated plasmid from the mixture for the studies in this paper. We determined the DNA sequence of the entire open reading frame for each chosen plasmid. By comparison with yeast DNA (33Cherry J.M. Adler C. Ball C. Chervitz S.A. Dwight S.S. Hester E.T. Jia Y.

We assume that these mutations do not adversely affect the biochemistry of the fusion proteins. For the Pcl1 and Pho81 pools, an authentic GST fusion plasmid could not be found.Table IIIMutations in GST fusion plasmidsPlasmidGeneMutation(s)Residue changep2466PHO80T137CL46PG351ASilentp3085PHO85A283TK61Ip2470CLG1A290GN97Sp2465PCL2G747ASilentp2477PCL5T277CC93Rp2462PCL6T262CS87PA316CT105PA268TSilentA639GSilentT706CY235HT1233CSilentp2469PCL7T135CSilentp2467PCL8T1435CSilentp2468PCL9A201GSilentp2476PCL10T1188ASilentp2475GLC8T220CS74P Open table in a new tab E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (34Studier F.W.

Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a 6 mm final concentration, and the culture was grown an additional 5 h. The harvested cell pellets were resuspended in 1/20th culture volume of sonication buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated three times for 1-min intervals on ice with a 250 watt sonicator at 50% maximum power. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant proteins were heated at 95 °C for 15 min. The denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation. Contaminating high molecular weight substances were removed by passing supernatant through a 300,000 nominal molecular weight limit cellulose membrane (Millipore). The final supernatant containing Glc8 was stored at −20 °C. Yeast crude extracts were prepared by vortexing exponential phase cells 4 × 30 s at 4 °C in the presence of glass beads and an equal volume of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaF, 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 4 °C. To remove contaminating endogenous ATP, the extracts were further purified through P25 spin columns (Bio-Rad). The eluants were collected, and the protein concentrations were quantitated using bovine serum albumin as a standard (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Glc8 kinase assay reactions were performed by mixing 10 μg of crude yeast extract or the indicated amounts of purified GST fusion protein, 2.5 μg of Glc8, 5 μl of ATP mixture (1 mm ATP, 25 mmMgCl2, 1200 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP), and homogenization buffer without protease inhibitor, in a final volume of 25 μl. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Adding equal volumes of 2× SDS loading buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) stopped reactions. The samples were then heated for 3 min at 95 °C and resolved with SDS-PAGE (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film or to a Kodak phosphorimaging screen. The data on phosphorimaging screens were read on Molecular Imager FX and analyzed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The strain JC945–8C/p2087 was mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate to 10% survival and plated on YEPD (37Lawrence C.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A colony sectoring assay was used to recognize and isolate GLC8-dependent mutants (38Bender A. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 39Zheng J. Cannon J.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 293-303PubMed Google Scholar, 40Zheng J. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18070-18078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Putative GLC8-dependent mutants were initially selected by their inability to sector. TrueGLC8-dependent mutants regained their ability to sector when transformed with p1945. By this method we isolated 11 independent GLC8-dependent mutants after screening 2 × 105 colonies. All of the mutations were complemented by CEN GLC7 plasmids and were genetically linked to the GLC7 locus. We retrieved the GLC7 locus from one of the mutant strains, JC968–1, by plasmid gap repair (11Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Orr-Weaver T.L. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Transformation of JC968–1 with p1855 deleted for a GLC7 BglII-SalI fragment yielded sectoring and nonsectoring transformants. The sectoring transformants had repaired the p1855 gap to wild-type GLC7,whereas the nonsectoring ones did not contain wild-typeGLC7. Sequencing of DNA of the retrieved GLC7locus from two independent nonsectoring transformants revealed a G to A transition in codon 121, which converted the wild-type Glc7 Arg-121 to Lys (glc7-R121K). The Glc8 dependence of previously isolatedglc7 mutations (16Ramaswamy N.T., Li, L. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 57-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was tested by complementation of theglc7-R121K sectoring trait and by lethality in the absence of GLC8. EJ758 transformants were grown at 30 °C to exponential phase in SC −Ura (A 600 = 0.8) and induced with 500 μm CuSO4 for 2 h. Note that transformants with purified Pho85 cyclin fusions could not grow on SC −Ura −Leu, which would elevate the plasmid copy number. The cells were glass bead extracted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mNaCl, 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture. Binding to glutathione-agarose (Sigma), washing, and dialysis were as described (32Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 55 mmNaCl, 50% (v/v) glycerol and then stored at −20 °C. The homology between Glc8 and mammalian I-2 is greatest surrounding I-2 Thr-72, the residue that is phosphorylated by GSK3, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2, and CDK5 (6Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12144-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang Q.M.

Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding Thr-118 in Glc8 was previously shown to be important for Glc8 function in vivo(12Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined whether Glc8 Thr-118 was actually phosphorylated. Indeed, yeast crude extracts efficiently phosphorylated Glc8 in vitro (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, a mutant Glc8 in which alanine is substituted for Thr-118 (Glc8-T118A) was not phosphorylated (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). I-2 is phosphorylated at additional sites by CK2 (7DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12144-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Holmes C.F.B. Kuret J. Chisholm A.A.K. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although yeast contains CK2 and our reaction conditions were favorable for its activity, Glc8-T118A was not phosphorylated in vitro. This is consistent with the fact that sites that correspond to I-2 CK2 phosphorylation are not found in Glc8. Therefore, Thr-118 is the major site of Glc8 phosphorylation under the conditions of our in vitro reactions. Presently, two methods exist for assaying Glc8 in vivo function. The first, reduction of glycogen accumulation was the trait that initially identified glc8 loss of function mutations (11Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, high copy GLC8 was found to suppress ipl1 mutations caused by the antagonistic relationship of Ipl1 protein kinase and Glc7 phosphatase (12Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the latter method drastically altered in vivo Glc8 concentration. Thus, we hunted for mutants that were dependent on Glc8 for viability. We anticipated that mutations lethal in combination with loss of Glc8 could reveal additional functions of Glc8. Such mutants would provide a way of assessing Glc8 function in vivo at normal Glc8 concentrations. We used the synthetic lethal screening method (38Bender A. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 39Zheng J. Cannon J.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 293-303PubMed Google Scholar, 40Zheng J. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18070-18078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to isolate mutants that became dependent on Glc8 for viability. The 11GLC8-dependent mutants isolated all contained mutations in GLC7. The GLC7 locus from one of these mutants contained a glc7-R121K mutation (“Experimental Procedures”). In a previous study, 18glc7 point mutations were isolated based on their effects on glycogen metabolism (16Ramaswamy N.T., Li, L. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 57-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of these 18 mutants revealed thatglc7 alleles R121K, R142H, andR198D are strictly dependent on Glc8 for growth and that some other glc7 alleles show intermediate growth traits withglc8. To test whether phosphorylation is necessary for Glc8 function in vivo, we tested the ability of glc8-T118A to complement two traits: the glc7-R121K Glc8-dependent trait and the glc8 glycogen deficiency trait. As shown in Fig. 2, plasmid pYT115 (glc8-T118A) was incapable of complementing both of these traits. Therefore,glc8-T118A does not encode a functional Glc8 in vivo. Because Glc8-T118A protein is not phosphorylated in vitro, we conclude that Glc8 function requires Glc8 phosphorylation. To determine which yeast protein kinase phosphorylates Glc8, we used a collection of yeast strains that each express a GST fusion to a yeast protein kinase (32Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Initially, GST fusion proteins were purified from pools of cells. The GST protein kinase fusions were purified from 12 pools of 10 strains each and used for in vitro Glc8 kinase assays. Protein from pool 6 had the greatest Glc8 kinase activity (Fig. 1 B). Next, GST protein kinases were purified and assayed from the ten component strains in pool 6. GST-Pho85 had the greatest Glc8 kinase activity"

By contrast, direct apical transport originating from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), which may contribute to polarity establishment, has been poorly defined in these cells. Thus, although newly synthesized sphingolipids can be directly transported from the TGN to the apical membrane, numerous apical resident proteins are traveling via the transcytotic route. Here, we developed an in vitro transport assay and compared the molecular sorting of 6-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3 diazol-4-yl)amino] hexanoyl-sphingomyelin (C6NBD-SM) and C6NBD-glucosylceramide (C6NBD-GlcCer) in TGN and SAC. SM is released from both TGN and SAC in the lumenal leaflet of transport vesicles. This holds also for GlcCer released from the SAC but not for a substantial fraction that departed from the Golgi. Distinct transport vesicles, enriched in either SM or GlcCer are released from SAC, consistent with their rigid sorting in this compartment. Different vesicle populations could not be recovered from TGN, although in situ experiments reveal that GlcCer is preferentially transported to the apical membrane, reflecting different transport mechanisms. The results indicate that in HepG2 cells sphingolipids are mainly sorted in the SAC membrane and that the release of SM from SAC and TGN is differentially regulated.

These differences are generated and maintained, despite a continuous membrane flux between these domains and intracellular organelles, sorting and vesicular transport being instrumental in these events (1Rothman J.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Two major pathways have been implicated in polarized sorting. De novo synthesized proteins and lipids are sorted to either plasma membrane in the trans-Golgi network (TGN)1 (2Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Ikonen E. Simons K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, molecular redistribution can also be mediated by the endosomal sorting machinery (4Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Thus, proteins and lipids internalized from the basolateral and apical membrane meet in an apically localized common endosome (5Knight A. Hughson E. Hopkins C.R. Cutler D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), defined as the subapical compartment (SAC) in HepG2 cells (6Van IJzendoorn S.C.D. Hoekstra D. Trends. Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 144-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, molecules are sorted and either recycled to the original membrane or transcytosed to the opposite membrane domain (7Gibson A. Futter C.E. Maxwell S. Allchin E.H. Shipman M. Kraehenbuhl J.P.

The existence of two such pathways raise intriguing questions concerning the relative contributions of SAC and TGN to polarity generation and maintenance and the molecular nature of the sorting machinery involved in either pathway. Detergent-insoluble membrane domains, called rafts (8Verkade P. Simons K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 108: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), have been implicated in sorting (9Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar), although raft formation per se is probably not sufficient for apical targeting (10Benting J.H. Rietveld A.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). (Glyco)sphingolipids, together with cholesterol, are the main lipid constituents of rafts and the finding that inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis, but not cholesterol depletion, interferes with the apical sorting of detergent-insoluble GPI-anchored proteins in Fischer rat thyroid cells (11Lipardi C. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) indicates that sphingolipids are especially important for the sorting of apical cargo. In many epithelial cells newly synthesized proteins are sorted in the TGN and directly transported to either the basolateral or apical membrane (3Ikonen E. Simons K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast, hepatocytes transport most (12Bartles J.R. Hubbard A.L.

Yet, in these cells, newly synthesized analogs of SM and GlcCer can be transported directly from the TGN to the BC membrane (16Zegers M.M.P. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), although it has not been determined whether, similar to MDCK and Caco-2 cells (17Van Meer G. Stelzer E.H. Wijnaendts van Resandt R.W. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1623-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 18Van't Hof W. van Meer G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), sphingolipids are actually sorted in the TGN. In the latter studies, it was shown that de novo synthesized C6NBD-labeled sphingolipid analogs can be sorted in the TGN, directing C6NBD-GlcCer preferentially to the apical membrane, whereas SM distributes about equally over apical and basolateral domains. In MDCK cells, it has been demonstrated that the common recycling endosome is enriched in raft lipids (19Gagescu R. Demaurex N. Parton R.G. Hunziker W. Huber L.A. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2775-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This could imply that by analogy the formation of sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains may be important for polarized sorting in the SAC as well. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that the SAC is intimately involved in regulating the distribution of both of these lipids during transcytotic transport (20Van IJzendoorn S.C.D. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Van IJzendoorn S.C.D. Hoekstra D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At steady state, SM is transported predominantly from the SAC to the basolateral membrane, whereas GlcCer is recycling between the SAC and the BC membrane (20Van IJzendoorn S.C.D. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence suggests that the exiting of both lipid analogs from SAC is vesicle-mediated (20Van IJzendoorn S.C.D. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, de novo synthesized GlcCer analogs (22Zegers M.M.P. Kok J.W. Hoekstra D. Biochem.

A. 1994; 91: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) may at least in part be transported as monomers, likely from an early Golgi compartment, where its synthesis occurs at the cytosolic surface (25Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar,26Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Following arrival at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, transmembrane translocation of the GlcCer analogs has been shown to occur via ABC transporter proteins (23Raggers R.J. van Helvoort A. Evers R. van Meer G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 415-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Van Helvoort A. Smith A.J. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms that govern these various sorting processes, the regulation of sphingolipid transport in the biosynthetic and endocytotic pathways, and how vesicular transport derived from SAC and TGN contribute to the biogenesis and maintenance of polarity, the isolation of the putative transport vesicles and the reconstitution of vesicular transport of both proteins and lipids in permeabilized cells are desirable. Thus far, most studies focusing on these issues have been restricted to the analysis of vesicular protein transport (28Wandinger-Ness A. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 29Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Cell. 1990; 60: 837-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 30Simon J.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16952-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas only a few in vitro studies have been developed to characterize the vesicular transport of lipids (31Kobayashi T. Pimplikar S.W. Parton R.G. Bhakdi S. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Babia T. Kok J.W. van der Haar M. Kalicharan R. Hoekstra D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 172-181PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we developed an in vitro assay using permeabilized HepG2 cells to study the exit of fluorescently tagged SM and GlcCer from the SAC and TGN. The purpose was to reveal the occurrence and nature of sorting in either compartment, thereby improving our knowledge of where and how membrane domains enriched in sphingolipids may contribute to the sorting of apical and basolateral proteins. We demonstrate that both sphingolipids can exit SAC and TGN in transport vesicles. However, whereas SAC-derived trafficking is exclusively vesicle-mediated, a fraction of the newly synthesized GlcCer exits from Golgi by a mechanism that does not involve its packaging into the lumenal side of transport vesicles. Moreover, evidence is presented that SM and GlcCer are released in distinct vesicles from the SAC, highlighting the prominent role of this compartment as a sorting station in the transcytotic pathway. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Hanks' balanced salt solution were from Invitrogen, and trifluoperazine (TFP) was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). C6NBD was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and cyclosporin A (CSA) was from Alexis (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). High performance-TLC plates and sodium dithionite were purchased from Merck, and PDMP was from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). BSA (fraction V), Dowex 1X8–200, rhodamine 123, d-sphingosine, 1β-d-glucosylsphingosine, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine were from Sigma. MK571 was kindly provided by E. Vellenga (University of Groningen). All other materials were of analytical grade. HepG2 cells were grown in 25-cm2cell culture flasks (Costar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4500 mg of glucose/liter, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. For the experiments, the cells were used 3 days after plating when they were maximally polarized (33Van IJzendoorn S.C.D. Zegers M.M.P. Kok J.W. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). C6NBD-ceramide, C6NBD-GlcCer, and C6NBD-SM were synthesized from C6NBD and d-sphingosine, 1β-d-glucosylsphingosine, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine, respectively, as described elsewhere (34Kishimoto Y. Chem. Phys. Lip. 1975; 15: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids were stored at −20 °C and routinely checked for purity. To analyze sphingolipid transport of intact HepG2 cells, they were labeled with 4 μm of C6NBD-sphingolipids. For in vitro studies 8 μm of sphingolipids were used. To label the TGN, the cells were incubated with C6NBD-ceramide in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 90 min at 18 °C. Noninternalized ceramide was removed from the plasma membrane by back-exchange with 5% BSA at 4 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution (2 × 30 min). The cells were incubated for an additional 90 min at 18 °C in presence of 5% BSA. To label the SAC, the cells were incubated with C6NBD-SM and -GlcCer in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Noninternalized sphingolipids were removed by back-exchange, and the sphingolipids were chased into the SAC for 2 h at 18 °C in presence of BSA. Sphingolipids that had been transported to the BC membrane were quenched for 10 min with 30 mm sodium dithionite at 4 °C. At these conditions, the agent does not permeate the membrane and exclusively abolishes NBD fluorescence that is localized in the external leaflet of the BC (20Van IJzendoorn S.C.D. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To study basolateral transport after labeling of the TGN, HepG2 cells were incubated for various time intervals at 37 °C in presence of 5% BSA, acting as a scavenger for basolaterally arrived lipid. The incubation medium and the cells were collected separately, and the lipids of both fractions were extracted and analyzed by TLC as described previously (34Kishimoto Y. Chem. Phys. Lip. 1975; 15: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To study apical transport the cells were grown on coverslips, and the TGN was labeled as described above. The cells were incubated for various time intervals at 37 °C in back-exchange medium. Transport to the BC membrane was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. BC structures were identified in phase contrast and characterized as C6NBD-positive or -negative after switching to epifluorescence, as has been described in detail elsewhere (33Van IJzendoorn S.C.D. Zegers M.M.P. Kok J.W. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Images were scanned and processed with Paint Shop Pro. After loading either TGN or SAC of HepG2 cells with C6NBD-sphingolipids, the cells were scraped from the culture dish into 1 ml of transport buffer (140 mm KCl, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3). The cells were permeabilized by pressing them four times through a 25-gauge syringe, and cell debris was removed by a brief centrifugation step (10 min, 2000 ×g). The permeabilized cells were treated for 30 min at 4 °C with 5% BSA, washed once in transport buffer, and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of cytosol (2 mg/ml), ATP, an ATP-regenerating system, and 1% BSA. After the incubation, the cells were removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 2 h at 100,000 × g to recover membrane-associated sphingolipids, which were protected from BSA. The lipids of all fractions were extracted and analyzed by TLC. To calculate the release of C6NBD-sphingolipids in the lumenal leaflet of vesicles, the amount recovered in the 100,000 ×g pellet was correlated to the total amount of this sphingolipid prior to the incubation (2000 × g pellet + 100,000 × g supernatant + 100,000 ×g pellet). The amount of sphingolipids that became accessible to BSA (100,000 × g supernatant) was determined similarly. The vesicular supernatant obtained from the in vitro budding assay was immediately loaded onto a continuous gradient of 20–50% sucrose (w/w) in transport buffer. The gradient was centrifuged for 16 h at 100,000 × g in an SW50 rotor (Beckman) and fractionated. Immediately before lipid extraction the obtained gradient fractions were treated for 5 min with 30 mm sodium dithionite at 4 °C to quench any NBD fluorescence associated with sphingolipids that were extracted by BSA and/or exposed in theouter leaflet of the membranes. HepG2 cells were grown for 3 days on 165-cm2 dishes, washed and scraped into 0.5 ml of transport buffer. The cells of 5–10 dishes were collected and homogenized with a tight Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g to remove cell debris and nuclei, and the post nuclear supernatant was centrifuged two times at 100,000 ×g. The final supernatant was used in the in vitroexperiments. Gradient fractions containing vesicles enriched in C6NBD-sphingolipids were collected and adjusted with transport buffer to a sucrose concentration of 10% (w/w). The vesicles were pelleted for 3 h at 100,000 × g. After fixation for 15 min with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in transport buffer containing 10% sucrose, the pellets were preincubated for 15 min in the dark with 0.15% (w/w) diaminobenzidine (DAB). For photoconversion of DAB by the NBD-labeled sphingolipids, the pellets were illuminated for 30 min at a wavelength of 460 nm (for experimental details see Ref. 36Pagano R.E. Sepanski M.A. Martin O.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thereafter the pellets were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 1% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and embedded in Epon. After sectioning, the structures containing osmiophilic precipitates were analyzed using a Philips CM100 electron microscope at 80 kV. The micrographs were scanned and processed with Paint Shop Pro. To assay for galactosyltransferase (GTase) activity, the samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of a mixture containing (final concentrations) 100 mm cacodylic acid (pH 7.3), 20 mm N-acetylglucosamine, 20 mmMnCl2, 4 mm ATP, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.7 mm UDP-galactose (including 100,000 dpm [14C]UDP-galactose). The incubation was stopped by the addition of 450 μl of cold H2O, and [14C]N-acetyllactosamine was separated from [14C]UDP-galactose by a Dowex 1X8–200 column. The values obtained in the presence of N-acetylglucosamine were corrected for control values (containing H2O), and the specific activity (dpm/μg protein) was determined. Finally the amount of GTase in each sample was determined by multiplying the specific activity with the protein content. Both Golgi-derived transport of de novo synthesized sphingolipids and SAC-derived glycosphingolipid transport contribute to the biogenesis and maintenance of polarized membrane domains in HepG2 cells. Although direct sphingolipid transport from Golgi to the BC membrane can occur in liver cells (16Zegers M.M.P. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the mechanism of transport has not been determined, and it is also unknown whether sorting of the lipid species occurs as observed in other epithelial cells (17Van Meer G. Stelzer E.H. Wijnaendts van Resandt R.W. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1623-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 18Van't Hof W. van Meer G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we first determined the mechanism by which newly synthesized GlcCer and SM reach the basolateral and apical membrane in optimally polarized HepG2 cells. This flux was then compared with the transport of both these lipids from the SAC, involved in membrane dynamics related to endocytotic events at either membrane surface, to appreciate the relative contribution of either pathway to membrane polarity development in liver cells. To analyze the exit of newly synthesized sphingolipids from the TGN in HepG2 cells, the cells were labeled for 90 min with C6NBD-ceramide at 18 °C. After a wash, the sphingolipids were chased for an additional 90 min at 18 °C in the presence of 5% BSA. The latter will preclude the re-entry of basolaterally arrived lipids into the cell. After the chase, the perinuclear region of the cells was brightly labeled (Fig. 1, A and B), which is typical for a Golgi localization in these cells (16Zegers M.M.P. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 50% of the ceramide was metabolized to C6NBD-SM and -GlcCer (in a molar ratio of 3:1, Fig. 1 C), the only products that could be detected. The accumulation of the newly synthesized lipids in the Golgi is reflected by the observation that only approximately 10% of both sphingolipids were transported from the Golgi, presumably exiting from the TGN, to the basolateral plasma membrane during the incubation at 18 °C (Fig. 1 D). During the incubation at 18 °C, no significant labeling of the BC could be detected (Fig. 1 B), implying that sphingolipid transport from Golgi to BC was impeded, whereas evidently C6NBD-Cer did not acquire access to the BC. However, when the temperature was subsequently raised to 37 °C in the presence of 5% BSA, 50–60% of the BCs were C6NBD-positive after a 30-min incubation period (Fig. 2,A–C). Treatment with sodium dithionite after the incubation reduced the amount of labeled BCs to control levels (Fig. 2 C), providing evidence that the C6NBD-labeled sphingolipids were transported directly to the exoplasmicleaflet of the BC membrane. After longer incubation times (30–60 min) the amount of positive BCs decreased again, indicating that both sphingolipids are transcytosed from the apical to the basolateral membrane (33Van IJzendoorn S.C.D. Zegers M.M.P. Kok J.W. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), where they are captured by BSA (Fig. 2 C). Because the BC membrane is not accessible to BSA, the direct quantification of the apically transported sphingolipid analogs is not possible. To discriminate between the fate of either newly synthesized C6NBD-GlcCer or -SM, the cells were therefore incubated with 10 μm PDMP, which completely inhibited the synthesis of C6NBD-GlcCer but did not affect synthesis of SM (data not shown). At these conditions, the fraction of the total pool of SM that was transported over a 30-min time interval to the basolateral membrane was not affected (Fig. 2 D), but the number of labeled BCs after 30 min of transport was reduced by approximately 40% (Fig. 2 D). Because only 25% of the total newly synthesized sphingolipid fraction (C6NBD-GlcCer plus C6NBD-SM) at control conditions consists of GlcCer, this result indicates that, in relative amounts, C6NBD-GlcCer is the major sphingolipid that is transported to the BC membrane. Yet, evidently, (a fraction of) C6NBD-SM is also transported from the Golgi to the BC membrane. Interestingly, C6NBD-GlcCer transport from the Golgi to the basolateral membrane was much faster than that of C6NBD-SM. After 15 min at 37 °C, 32% of the pool of C6NBD-GlcCer and 18% of that of C6NBD-SM had reached the basolateral membrane (Fig. 3, A and B). These different transport kinetics to the basolateral membrane of HepG2 cells are reminiscent of the fast transport of natural GlcCer compared with other sphingolipids in Chinese hamster ovary cells (24Warnock D.E. Lutz M.S. Blackburn W.A. Young W.W., Jr. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). With increasing incubation times the difference between SM and GlcCer with regard to the fraction of the total lipid pools that reached the basolateral membrane diminished, amounting to 75–80% of the pools of both sphingolipids after 60 min. As shown above (Fig. 2 C) the percentage of labeled BCs decreased concomitantly, emphasizing the integration of the newly synthesized sphingolipids in a dynamic transport process between apical and basolateral membrane. This is not the case after short term incubations (30 min; Fig. 2 C). Accordingly, this would therefore suggest that the rapid transfer of GlcCer from the Golgi to basolateral membrane after 15 min involves a direct transport step and, given its pool size compared with that of SM, may be related to a mechanism that differs from that of SM. GlcCer is synthesized at the cytoplasmic leaflet of the cis-Golgi (25Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and its transport from the Golgi surface to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane, either by monomeric flow or in the cytoplasmic leaflet of transport vesicles, has been described (24Warnock D.E. Lutz M.S. Blackburn W.A. Young W.W., Jr. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast to its natural counterpart, the short chain fluorescent GlcCer analog can be translocated to the exoplasmic leaflet by the basolaterally localized multidrug resistance protein MRP1 to become accessible for BSA (23Raggers R.J. van Helvoort A. Evers R. van Meer G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 415-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Roelofsen H. Vos T.A. Schippers L.J. Kuipers F. Koning H. Moshage H. Jansen P.L. Müller M. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Indeed, incubation with the MRP1 inhibitor MK571 significantly reduced the amount of C6NBD-GlcCer that became accessible to BSA but had no effect on the basolateral transport of C6NBD-SM (Fig. 3, A and B). The effect of MK571 on GlcCer transport was time-dependent, showing 60% inhibition of lipid translocation after 15 min, which diminished to approximately 35% after 30 min, whereas the effect had largely disappeared after 60 min. These data thus indicate that early (i.e. up to 15–30 min) after the onset of sphingolipid biosynthesis in HepG2 cells, the transport mechanism of SM and GlcCer from Golgi to the basolateral membrane at least partly differs. However, after longer incubation times, an increasing pool of the C6NBD-GlcCer is transported directly to the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane via a (slower) MRP-independent pathway that originates from an intracellular site that differs from the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi. In contrast to trafficking ofde novo synthesized GlcCer from Golgi to the basolateral membrane, GlcCer (and SM) exiting from SAC, after specific accumulation in this compartment following endocytic internalization (see “Experimental Procedures”), reaches the outer leaflet of the (apical) plasma membrane, entirely independent of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) activity (20Van IJzendoorn S.C.D. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To analyze how newly synthesized C6NBD-GlcCer and -SM are transported from the Golgi to the apical membrane, we examined the effect of CSA, an inhibitor of the MDR1 protein that is localized in the BC membrane of HepG2 cells (37Roelofsen H. Vos T.A. Schippers L.J. Kuipers F. Koning H. Moshage H. Jansen P.L. Müller M. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Incubation with 5 μmCSA, which completely abolished the translocation of rhodamine 123 into the BCs (data not shown) neither affected the number of labeled BCs nor the accessibility of the C6NBD-labeled sphingolipids to sodium dithionite (Fig. 3 C). In conjunction with the observation that upon inhibition of GlcCer biosynthesis BC labeling is reduced by almost 40% (see above), the results imply that the major part of the C6NBD-GlcCer (and -SM) is transported directly to the exoplasmic leaflet of the BC membrane, i.e. the lipid must have been localized in the lumenal leaflet of transport vesicles. To obtain direct evidence for this notion, we subsequently developed an"

A central player in this pathway is the cytokine-regulated receptor thrombomodulin (TM), which functions as a co-factor for the thrombin-dependent generation of activated protein C. We have found that tumor necrosis factor-β (TGF-β)-dependent suppression of TM on endothelial cells is differentially regulated by endothelial Smad6s and Smad7. Overexpression of Smad6s resulted in activation of a TGF-β reporter alone and enhanced TGF-β response. Moreover, Smad6s overexpression suppressed TM and subsequently reduced activated protein C generation. Antisense inhibition of Smad6s expression enhanced the TM-dependent activation of protein C, whereas blocking the inhibitory Smad7 by antisense resulted in reduced TM-dependent activation of protein C. The effect of Smad6s appeared to be due, at least in part, to up-regulation of TGF-β itself. Immunohistochemisty studies in normal versusatherosclerotic vessels showed that TM levels were suppressed in the endothelium over plaque. Consistent with the in vitro data, we found differential expression of Smad6s and Smad7 in normalversus atherosclerotic vessels, with Smad6s expression low in normal vessels but elevated in atherosclerotic vessels. In contrast, the opposite expression pattern was observed for Smad7.

In contrast, the opposite expression pattern was observed for Smad7. Overall, our results suggest that the relative balance of these intracellular Smads modulate the balance of endothelial function with regard to protein C activation. Endothelial dysfunction plays a critical role in the development of both chronic (atherosclerosis) and acute (thrombotic) cardiovascular disease (1Landmesser U. Hornig B. Drexler H. Semin. Thromb.

Sci. 2000; 902: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). An important modulator of endothelial function is activated protein C. Protein C is a plasma serine protease that has a well described role in maintaining normal hemostatic balance (5Esmon C.T. Arterioscler.

Upon activation by thrombin, activated protein C (APC) 1The abbreviations used are: APC, activated protein C; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; SFM, serum free medium; TGF-β, tumor necrosis factor-β; TM, thrombomodulin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline1The abbreviations used are: APC, activated protein C; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; SFM, serum free medium; TGF-β, tumor necrosis factor-β; TM, thrombomodulin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline acts as a feedback inhibitor of thrombin generation by inactivating the activated forms of Factors V and VIII, thus inhibiting the prothrombinase and Factor Xase enzyme complexes, respectively. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that activated protein C plays a key role in regulating endothelial genes associated with cell survival and anti-apoptotic activities, thereby directly modulating intracellular signaling and pathways that protect the interface between the vessel wall and the soluble environment (9Joyce D.E. Gelbert L. Ciaccia A. Dehoff B. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11199-11203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 10Grinnell B. Joyce D.E. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: S53-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Activated protein C has been shown to be an effective antithrombotic in a wide variety of venous and arterial thrombosis models (reviewed in Refs. 7Yan S.B. Grinnell B.W. Annu. Rep. Med. Chem. 1994; 11: 103-112Google Scholar, 11Yan S.B. Grinnell B.W. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1994; 1: 503-520Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, and 12Esmon C.T. Schwarz H.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and activated recombinant human protein C has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of severe sepsis (13Bernard G. Vincent J. Laterre P. LaRosa S. Dhainaut J. Lopez-Rodriguez A. Steingrub J. Garber G. Helterbrand J. Ely E. Fisher C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (5018) Google Scholar). The major physiologic factor controlling the activation of protein C by thrombin is the endothelial surface membrane protein thrombomodulin (TM) (14Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As thrombin is generated, it complexes with TM to form an enzyme complex that no longer has procoagulant activity (converting fibrinogen to fibrin) but instead has anti-thrombotic activity by converting zymogen protein C to APC. Areas of the human aorta at high risk for atherosclerosis have reduced TM and increased prothombinase activity (15Antonov A. Key N. Smirnov M. Jacob H. Vercellotti G. Smirnov V. Thromb. Res. 1992; 67: 135-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and TM has been shown to be reduced in the endothelium over atherosclerotic plaque (16Laszik Z. Zhou X. Ferrell G. Silva F. Esmon C. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 795-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In general, atherosclerotic lesions appear to be associated with acquired defects in the protein C system (17Lentz S. Fernandez J. Griffin J. Piegors D. Erger R. Malinow M. Heistad D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1744-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and poor response to APC generation has been suggested as a prominent risk predictor of advanced arterial disease (18Kiechl S. Muigg A. Santer P. Mitterer M. Egger G. Oberhollenzer M. Oberhollenzer F. Mayr A. Gasperi A. Poewe W. Willeit J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and ischemic stroke risk (19Folsom A. Rosamond W. Shahar E. Cooper L. Aleksic N. Nieto F. Rasmussen M. Wu K. Circulation. 1999; 100: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus, TM controls the balance between the pro-coagulant activities of thrombin (fibrin generation, platelet activation) and anticoagulant activity (APC generation) and determines a condition of either normal homeostasis or vessel pathology. The level of TM on endothelial cells has been shown to be modulated by cytokines, including transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Both TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 have been shown to down-regulate thrombomodulin mRNA expression in cultured human endothelial cells (20Ohji T. Urano H. Shirahata A. Yamagishi M. Higashi K. Gotoh S. Karasaki Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Tran N. Correale J. Schreiber S. Fisher M. Stroke. 1999; 30: 1671-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and increased TGF-β correlates with decreased TM-containing vessels in sustained local endothelial dysfunction (22Richter K. Fink L. Hughes B. Sung C. Hauer-Jensen M. Radiother. Oncol. 1997; 44: 65-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study, we have explored the role of TGF-β signaling in controlling the TM-dependent activation of protein C on endothelial cells, focusing on the role of endothelial Smad proteins. Most of the Smad family of proteins positively control signal transduction of the various members of the TGF-β family (reviewed in Refs. 23Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 24Verschueren K. Huylebroeck D.

Smad6 has been shown to inhibit signaling by the TGF-β superfamily (29Topper J. Cai J. Qiu Y. Anderson K. Xu Y. Deeds J. Feeley R. Gimeno C. Woolf E. Tayber O. Mays G. Sampson B. Schoen F.

The Smad7 protein has been extensively studied and shown to prevent phosphorylation of receptor-activated Smads, thereby inhibiting TGF-β-induced signaling responses (34Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y.

Recently, we described the characterization of an endothelial splice variant of Smad6, designated Smad6s, that showed differential activity relative to the inhibitory Smads in a Xenopus model, being an antagonist of the bone morphogenic protein pathway but an agonist of the activin pathways (38Krishnan P. King M.W. Neff A.W. Sandusky G.E. Bierman K.L. Grinnell B.W. Smith R.C. Dev. Growth Differ. 2001; 43: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Using overexpression and antisense modulation, we show that Smad6s positively mediates TGF-β repression of TM and subsequent reduction in APC generation in human endothelial cells. In contrast, the inhibitory Smad7 significantly reduced TGF-β down-regulation of APC generation. Furthermore, we show that Smad6s and Smad7 are counter-regulated in normal versusatherosclerotic plaques in a manner consistent with the down-regulated TM levels and APC generation in the endothelium of atherosclerotic vessels. Thrombin and hirudin were obtained from Sigma. Human protein C was produced as described previously (39Grinnell B.W. Berg D.T. Walls J. Yan S.B. Bio/Technology. 1987; 5: 1189-1192Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrate, S2366, was obtained from Chromogenix. TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 were purchased from R & D Systems. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and grown as described previously (40Richardson M.A. Berg D.T. Calnek D.S. Ciaccia A.V. Joyce D.E. Grinnell B.W. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3908-3911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SVHA-1 cells, an SV40-transformed human aortic endothelial cell line, were used to obtain high transfection rates needed for the antisense experiments. Cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (3:1), a medium comprised of a 3:1 v/v mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's nutrient mixture F-12. DMEM/F-12 (3:1) and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. The basal medium was supplemented with 10 nm selenium, 50 μm 2-aminoethanol, 20 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum. All other reagents were of the highest quality available. The vector pOCAT2336 for measuring TGF-β response and Smad expression vectors were described previously (38Krishnan P. King M.W. Neff A.W. Sandusky G.E. Bierman K.L. Grinnell B.W. Smith R.C. Dev. Growth Differ. 2001; 43: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were seeded in six-well plates to 80% confluence. DNA was transfected at a concentration of 1 μg for pOCAT2336 and 5 μg for the Smad vectors with Invitrogen's Lipofectin reagent and used accordingly to manufacturer's instruction. Expressed CAT protein was measured using a CAT ELISA kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and performed according to manufacturer's protocol. The plates were read kinetically and data expressed in mOD/min. The oligonucleotides used in antisense experiments were synthesized with phosphorothioates and C-5 propyne pyrimidines following standard protocols (41Wagner R.W. Matteucci M.D. Lewis J.G. Gutierrez A.J. Moulds C. Froehler B.C. Science. 1993; 260: 1510-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were designed to hybridize to the region of the Smad6s or the Smad7 mRNA encompassing the initial ATG. The sequence of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide for Smad6s was: 5′-GGTTTGCCCATTCTGGACAT-3′, and the sense strand control oligodeoxynucleotide for Smad6s was: 5′-ATGTCCAGAATGGGCAAACC-3′. The sequence of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide for Smad7 was: 5′-GATCGTTTGGTCCTGAACAT-3′, and the sense strand control oligodeoxynucleotide for Smad7 was: 5′-ATGTTCAGGACCAAACGATC-3′. Oligonucleotides were introduced to cells following a modification of a procedure as outlined in Ref. 41Wagner R.W. Matteucci M.D. Lewis J.G. Gutierrez A.J. Moulds C. Froehler B.C. Science. 1993; 260: 1510-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well COSTAR plates at a density of 2000 or 5000 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight. After washing monolayers with serum-free medium (SFM), a 10 or 20 μmconcentration of each oligonucleotides was introduced in 100 μl of SFM. Control wells containing SFM with vehicle alone were included in addition to the sense strand oligonucleotides controls. After an overnight incubation in the presence of oligos, each condition was rinsed with SFM and re-charged with oligonucleotides overnight as above. On the fourth day each experimental condition was treated with or without TGF-β at a concentration of 1 ng/ml in the maintenance medium. The antisense was shown to inhibit the Smad protein levels by Western blot analysis. Cell surface TM levels were assayed as described previously (42Calnek D. Grinnell B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). TM-dependent protein C activation was performed as follows: conditioned medium was removed and replaced with 100 μl of SFM containing 25 μg/ml human protein C and 0.5 units/ml thrombin. After 1-h incubation at room temperature, 75 μl was removed to a 96-well plate well containing 50 μl of 10 units/ml hirudin in activation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl) and incubated 5–10 min with agitation. Activated human protein C was then assayed by adding 50 μl of the chromogenic substrate S2366 and measuring the change in absorbance at 405 nm on a 5-min kinetic run using a Molecular Devices ThermoMax plate reader. TGF-β3 (43Lafyatis R. Lechleider R. Kim S.J. Jakowlew S. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19128-19136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TGF-β1 promoter (44Kim S.-J. Glick A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) constructs driving CAT expression (1 μg) were co-transfected with Smad6s vector (5 μg), Smad7 (5 μg), or with a control pCIneo vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection using Lipofectin in serum-free medium on ECV304 cells (ATCC CRL1998), previously plating cells at 3 × 105 cells per well in a six-well plate with DMEM/F-12 medium in 5% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 or TGF-β3 (R & D Systems) was added in serum-free DMEM medium containing 100 μg/ml Cohn's fractionated bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and supernatants were collected, and levels of endogenous latent TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 secreted into the supernatant were evaluated with ELISA kits according to manufacturer (R & D systems). The cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed, and CAT activity expressed was measured kinetically. Lysates were normalized using a BCA assay measuring total protein concentration. All tissue specimens were retrieved from the tissue bank of Lilly Research Laboratories. These tissues were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network using an institutional review board-approved protocol. All human samples were derived from surgical specimens obtained during the period extending from 1996 to 1999. Tissues were fixed overnight in zinc-buffered formalin and then transferred to 70% ethanol prior to processing through paraffin. Five-micrometer sections were microtomed and the slides baked overnight at 60 °C. The slides were then deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols to water. Antigen retrieval was performed by immersing the slides in Accutuf tissue unmasking solution (Accurate Chemical) for 10 min at 90 °C (in a water bath), cooling at room temperature for 10 min, washing in water, and then proceeding with immunostaining. All subsequent staining steps were performed on the Dako immunostainer; incubations were done at room temperature, and Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (TBS; Dako Corp.) was used for all washes and diluents. Thorough washing was performed after each incubation. Slides were blocked with protein blocking solution (Dako) for 5 min; after washing, a 10 μg/ml amount of the particular SMAD antibody (or irrelevant control antibody) was added to the slides and incubated for 30 min. A biotinylated secondary antibody plus streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase kit (Dako LSAB2) was then utilized along with a DAB chromagen and peroxide substrate to detect the bound antibody complexes. The slides were briefly counterstained with hematoxylin, removed from the autostainer, and dehydrated through graded alcohols to xylene. Coverslips were mounted with a permanent mounting medium. Scoring was based on a blind evaluation of the intensity and localization of staining using light microscopy as reviewed by two board-certified pathologists, with negative being the total absence of detectible staining. As described previously and shown in Fig.1 A, the level of surface TM is suppressed on human endothelial cells treated with TGF-β1. To determine whether this reduction in TM resulted in a concomitant reduction in the ability of cells to support APC generation, cells were treated with TGF-β, and the rate of thrombin-catalyzed activation of exogenous zymogen protein C was determined. As shown in Fig.1 B, the reduction in TM by TGF-β resulted in a significant reduction in the ability to support APC generation. The amount of APC generation was directly proportional to the relative level of thrombomodulin present on the cell surface (inset). Because our previous studies in Xenopus had shown that Smad6s had differential activity in modulating TFG-β family pathways, we examined its role in TGF-β signaling in endothelial cells. Co-transfection experiments were performed with a Smad6s mammalian expression vector and the TGF-β reporter plasmid (pOCAT2336) containing the CAT gene under the control of TGF-β-inducible plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene promoter. Endothelial cells transiently transfected with the reporter construct responded to TGF-β with an approximate 5-fold increase in reporter activity (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, transfection of cells with the Smad6s expression plasmid resulted in a similar increase in TGF-β-dependent promoter activity and enhanced the response in combination with TGF-β. The ability of Smad6s to induce a TGF-β-like response in the reporter assay was confirmed by examining its effect on TM-dependant APC activation. As shown in Fig. 2 B, transfection of cells with the Smad6s expression vector resulted in a significant suppression in APC generation, similar to that observed with treatment of cells with 1 ng/ml TGF-β. In control experiments with inhibitory Smad7 we showed complete inhibition of TGF-β response on both the reporters (Fig. 2 A) and TM levels (not shown), as would have been expected from previous studies. While the overexpression of Smad6s suggested a role in negatively regulating TM and APC generation, we confirmed these results by inhibiting endogenous Smad6s with antisense oligonucleotide. Endothelial cells were treated with sense or antisense oligonucleotides followed by stimulation with TGF-β. Smad6s antisense, but not a sense control, blocked the inhibition of TM by TGF-β (Fig. 2 C) and the inhibition of APC generation (Fig. 2 D). We also determined the effect of inhibiting Smad7 with antisense, and as expected (since Smad7 inhibits TGF-β response), the TGF-β response was enhanced as shown by an increased inhibition of TM in the presence of TGF-β (Fig. 2 C). The ability of Smad6s to mimic a TGF-β response suggested that possibly Smad6s can induce TGF-β expression. We examined the effect of Smad6s overexpression on TGF-β levels secreted into the culture medium and on a reporter construct driven by TGF-β promoters. As shown, Smad6s overexpression was capable of increasing the amount of TGF-β1 secreted from the cell (Fig. 3 A). We also assessed the effect on TGF-β3 and found a similar ∼6-fold increase in secreted TFG-β3 activity. This appeared to be the result of increased expression as indicated by the ability of Smad6s to induce both the TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 promoter (Fig. 3 B). These results suggested that the level of Smad6s in endothelial cells can alter the level of TGF-β and thus the relative level of TM and APC generation. The data above demonstrate a differential effect of Smad6s and Smad7 on the modulation of TM on human endothelial cells in culture. To determine whether this relationship was observed in endothelial cells in vivo, we examined normal and atherosclerotic human cardiovascular tissues with TM-, Smad6-, and Smad7-specific antibodies as described previously (38Krishnan P. King M.W. Neff A.W. Sandusky G.E. Bierman K.L. Grinnell B.W. Smith R.C. Dev. Growth Differ. 2001; 43: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, we observed a significant decrease in the level of TM in atheroslerotic coronary vessels. Consistent with the data above, we observed that Smad6s levels were undetectable in normal vessels and overexpressed in the endothelium over the plaque, as well as in the plaque vasculature. In contrast, Smad7 was expressed in normal vascular endothelium but significantly decreased in the plaque endothelium. This relationship of differential expression is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 4 Bfollowing analysis of 35 vessels for expression of Smad6s and Smad7. These data are consistent with the observations in cultured endothelial cells and suggest that TM levels, and therefore APC generation, are controlled by differential expression of the Smad proteins in vivo. Under normal circumstances, the vascular endothelium displays a number of regulatory mechanisms to modulate coagulation, inflammation, and vascular function to maintain homeostatic balance in the local environment (45Rosenberg R. Aird W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 46Vervloet M. Thijs L. Hack C. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1998; 24: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As this balance is disturbed, pathological processes, including thrombosis and atherosclerosis, ensue. While we have long considered APC as an important antithrombotic modulator, providing feedback inhibition of coagulation, the emerging data suggest that APC is also an agent that effectively modulates the balance of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic systems in response to injury (9Joyce D.E. Gelbert L. Ciaccia A. Dehoff B. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11199-11203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar,10Grinnell B. Joyce D.E. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: S53-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, factors that suppress protein C activation will compromise endothelial function and promote pathogenic processes. As reviewed above, recent studies have clearly linked low TM levels and defects in APC generation to vessel disease. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that TGF-β is overexpressed in fibroproliferative vascular lesions (47McCaffrey T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and appears to be most active in lipid-rich aortic intimal lesions (48Bobik A. Agrotis A. Kanellakis P. Dilley R. Krushinsky A. Smirnov V. Tararak E. Condron M. Kostolias G. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2883-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), consistent with the overexpression of Smad6s. TM suppression is recognized as a marker of sustained endothelial dysfunction (22Richter K. Fink L. Hughes B. Sung C. Hauer-Jensen M. Radiother. Oncol. 1997; 44: 65-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and its down-modulation clearly is the linked to increased TGF-β in the vessel and to the promotion of thrombogenesis at the sites of injury (20Ohji T. Urano H. Shirahata A. Yamagishi M. Higashi K. Gotoh S. Karasaki Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results provide new mechanistic understanding for the control of APC generation. In these studies we find that the balance of two TGF-β signaling molecules, Smad7 and Smad6s, can control the activation of APC by controlling the relative level of endothelial thrombomodulin. This appears to be at the level of controlling both TGF-β levels and signaling. Moreover the relative balance of these two molecules appears to correlate with TM levels in normal versus diseased vessels. The protein C pathway plays a unique and central role in modulating vascular function. In states of systemic inflammatory activation, loss of protein C results in a compromised ability to modulate coagulation, inflammatory, and cell survival functions, leading to vascular dysfunction (reviewed in Refs. 10Grinnell B. Joyce D.E. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: S53-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and 49Joyce D.E. Grinnell B.W. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S288-S293Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that TGF-β plays a prominent role in controlling the activation of the protein C pathway and that targeting Smad signals may provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in treating and preventing vascular dysfunction. We thank Bruce Gerlitz and Rebecca Fouts of excellent technical help and Dr. Dean Falb (formerly of Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.) for supplying Smad vectors."
https://openalex.org/W1996481470,"Insidious attack of cortical neurons by complement has been implicated in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Excitotoxicity, triggered by excessive activation of glutamate receptors, has been implicated in neuronal death following diverse insults, including ischemia and seizures. Clinical studies suggested that a minimal excitotoxic insult might sensitize neurons to complement attack. We found that fleeting activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors sensitizes neurons but not astrocytes to complement attack. The complement molecule effecting cytotoxicity was the membrane attack complex. The site within the complement cascade at which sensitization was effected was the membrane attack pathway. Sensitization mediated by glutamate receptor activation required Ca(2+)(o) and generation of reactive oxygen species. These in vitro findings predict that a fleeting excitotoxic insult could act synergistically with complement to destroy cortical neurons and accelerate neurological deterioration."
https://openalex.org/W2065205699,"Previous work from our laboratory has shown that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) increases the expression of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) α1subunit by regulating DHPR α1S nuclear transcription. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which IGF-1 enhances expression of the DHPR α1S gene. To this end, the promoter region of the mouse DHPRα1S gene was recently cloned and sequenced and various promoter deletion-luciferase reporter constructs were used. These constructs were transfected into C2C12 cells and IGF-1 effects were measured by recording luciferase activity. IGF-1 significantly enhancedDHPR α1S transcription in those constructs carrying cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) binding site but not in CREB core binding site mutants. Gel mobility shift assay using a double stranded oligonucleotide for the CREB site in the promoter region, and competition experiments with excess unlabeled or mutated promoter oligonucleotide, and unlabeled consensus CREB oligonucleotide demonstrated that IGF-1 induces CREB binding to the DHPRα1S promoter. IGF-1-mediated enhancement in charge movement was prevented by incubating the cells with antisense but not with sense oligonucleotides against CREB. These results support the conclusion that IGF-1 regulates DHPR α1S transcription in muscle cells by acting on the CREB element of the promoter. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) increases the expression of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) α1subunit by regulating DHPR α1S nuclear transcription. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which IGF-1 enhances expression of the DHPR α1S gene. To this end, the promoter region of the mouse DHPRα1S gene was recently cloned and sequenced and various promoter deletion-luciferase reporter constructs were used. These constructs were transfected into C2C12 cells and IGF-1 effects were measured by recording luciferase activity. IGF-1 significantly enhancedDHPR α1S transcription in those constructs carrying cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) binding site but not in CREB core binding site mutants. Gel mobility shift assay using a double stranded oligonucleotide for the CREB site in the promoter region, and competition experiments with excess unlabeled or mutated promoter oligonucleotide, and unlabeled consensus CREB oligonucleotide demonstrated that IGF-1 induces CREB binding to the DHPRα1S promoter.

IGF-1 is a peptide structurally related to proinsulin and has a primary role in promoting skeletal muscle differentiation and growth (1Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that IGF-1 regulates the ion permeation function of the dihydropyridine (DHP)-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channel in skeletal muscle (2Delbono O. Renganathan M. Messi M.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6918-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Renganathan M. Sonntag W.E. Delbono O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DHPR and ryanodine receptor and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content are directly involved in regulating the amplitude of the muscle fiber Ca2+ influx (see Ref. 4Melzer W. Herrmann-Frank A. Luttgau H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 59-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Prior studies from our laboratory have shown that the age-related decrease in the number of DHPR and ryanodine receptor 1 isoforms can be prevented by overexpression of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle (5Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Delbono O. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We have also shown that IGF-1 enhances skeletal muscle charge movement, [3H]PN200–110 binding sites, andDHPR α1S message expression in single muscle fibers from adult rats (6Wang Z.-M. Messi M.L. Renganathan M. Delbono O. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whether IGF-1 regulates DHPRα1S expression by acting on specific consensus sequences of the DHPR α1S 5′-flanking region is not known. To address this issue, a combination of molecular and electrophysiological techniques was used in the present study. The DHPR α1S (known also as Cav1.1 α11.1, α1S, or CaCh1) is encoded in the human chromosome 1q31–32 by the CACNA1S gene and expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle (7Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A.

The DHPR consists of five subunits (α1, α2, β, γ, and δ), α1 being the subunit that senses changes in membrane voltage, forms the Ca2+ conduction pore, binds to dihydropyridines, and interacts with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel or ryanodine receptor 1 isoform to release Ca2+ from the organelle into the myoplasm in response to membrane depolarization (9Block B.A. Imagawa T.

The DHPR is located at the infoldings of the sarcolemma, named T-tubule, and plays a critical role in excitation-contraction coupling (4Melzer W. Herrmann-Frank A. Luttgau H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 59-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Because of the pivotal role of the DHPR α1S subunit in excitation-contraction coupling, its expression is of crucial importance for skeletal muscle contraction. DHPR α1S cDNA restores excitation-contraction coupling in dysgenic mice (12Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 13Tanabe T.

DHPR α1S subunit expression is subject to regulation by a series of factors, including aging (5Renganathan M. Messi M.L. Delbono O. J. Membr.

Commu. 1997; 240: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that IGF-1 and age regulate DHPR α1S gene transcription in murine skeletal muscle (23Zheng Z. Messi M.L. Delbono O. Mech. Aging Dev. 2001; 122: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All these factors result in changes in DHPR α1S subunit abundance. Despite the diverse modulation of channel expression, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not known. The recent characterization of the DHPRα1S 5′-flanking region allows for a better understanding of channel transcription and abundance (24Zheng Z. Wang Z.-M. Delbono O. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In that study, we have identified the consensus sequence for three transcription factors involved in the regulation of the DHPR α1Sexpression in muscle cells. Deletion experiments in the core of the consensus sequence for these transcription factors and antisense procedures support that GATA-2, CREB, and SOX-5 play a significant role in the DHPR α1S transcription and DHPR α1S subunit functional expression in differentiated skeletal muscle cells. Whether these transcription factors mediate IGF-1-induced DHPR α1S expression enhancement is not known. The mouse C2C12 muscle cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), cultured in standard conditions, and maintained in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin was used as the differentiation medium. For charge movement recordings C2C12 cells were plated on glass coverslips and mounted in a small flow-through Lucite chamber positioned on a microscope stage. Myotubes were continuously perfused with the external solution (see below) using a push-pull syringe pump (WPI, Saratoga, FL). Cells were voltage-clamped in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp (25Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15167) Google Scholar) using an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Micropipettes were pulled from borosilicate glasses (Boralex) using a Flaming Brown micropipette puller (P97, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) to obtain electrode resistance ranging from 2 to 4 MΩ. The composition of the internal solution (pipette) was (mm): 140 Cs-aspartate, 5 Mg-aspartate2, 10 Cs2EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH was adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH. The high concentration of Mg2+ in the pipette solution helped to maintain the preparation stable for longer time. The external solution contained (mm): 145 tetraethylammonium hydroxide-Br, 10 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 0.001 tetrodotoxin (26Beam K.G. Knudson C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 781-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Solution pH was adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH. This solution was used for forming gigaohm seals. For charge movements recording, calcium current was blocked with a solution containing (mm): 145 tetraethylammonium hydroxide-Br, 2 CaCl2, 0.5 Cd2+, 0.3 La3+, 10 HEPES, and 0.001–0.003 tetrodotoxin (27Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The maximum integral of the charge movement (see below) was used for the statistical analysis. Whole cell currents were acquired and filtered at 5 kHz with pClamp 6.04 software (Axon Instruments). A Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments) was used for A–D conversion. Membrane current during a voltage pulse, P, was initially corrected by analog subtraction of linear components. The remaining linear components were digitally subtracted on-line using hyperpolarizing control pulses of one-quarter test pulse amplitude (−P/4 procedure) (20Delbono O. J. Physiol. 1992; 451: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The four control pulses were applied before the test pulse. Charge movements were evoked by 25-ms depolarizing voltage steps from the holding potential (−80 mV) to command potentials ranging from −70 to 70 mV. Intramembrane charge movements were calculated as the integral of the current in response to depolarizing pulses (charge on, Q on) and were expressed per membrane capacitance (coulombs per farad). The complete blockade of the inward calcium current was verified by theQ on-Q off linear relationship. Membrane capacitance was calculated as the integral of the transient current in response to a brief hyperpolarizing pulse from −80 mV (holding potential) to −90 mV. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized and phosphorothioated in 3 nucleotides at both ends by IDT (Coralville, IA). The following sense and antisense oligonucleotides were used: sense for CREB, 5′-GAATCTGGAGCAGAC-3′ and antisense for CREB, 5′-GTCTGCTCCAGATTC-3′ (24Zheng Z. Wang Z.-M. Delbono O. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Imagawa S. Yamamoto M. Miura Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 30Kim J.-G. Amano O. Wakayama T. Takahagi H. Iseki S. Arch. Oral Biol. 2001; 46: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were transfected into cultured C2C12 myotubes using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer. After transfection, the dishes were gently rocked and then incubated at a 10% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C, for 48 h before recordings. The full sequence or partial fragments of theDHPR α1S promoter (24Zheng Z. Wang Z.-M. Delbono O. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (GenBankTMaccession number for the 1.2-kb 5′-flanking region is AF343753) were fused with the luciferase reporter gene as explained previously (24Zheng Z. Wang Z.-M. Delbono O. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sequential deletion constructs were generated by PCR cloning using specific primers. The correct orientation of the constructs and sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI Prism Cycle Sequencing, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All of the plasmids used in the present work were purified with QIAfilter (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells, and grown in growth medium on 35-mm dishes till reaching 70% confluence. For cell transfection, 1 μg of each plasmid and 200 ng of the control vector pRL-TK (Promega) were mixed with 2 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min at room temperature and added to the medium directly. Cells were induced to differentiate by changing to differentiation medium and cultured for 3 days. Cell lysis was prepared using a passive lysis buffer for the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Luciferase and renilla activity were measured using a luminometer (Turner 20E, Sunnyvale, CA) and expressed as arbitrary units. Values for the luciferase assay were normalized to renilla luciferase activity to minimize differences in transfection efficiency for each experiment. The Luc/P-146 construct was mutated using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The specific primers used for deletion of core nucleotides in transcription factor binding sites in this system were: for CREB-del, 5′-TCCAGTCCAGCCGGATCCCCATCTGCCCC-3′; for MZF1-del, 5′-CCTCGGGGGCAGATGTGTCACCGGCTGGAC-3′; for GATA-2-del, 5′-AGCCGGTGACATCCCTGCCCCCGAGGAGGC-3′. After alkaline denaturation of the Luc/P-146 construct, the DNA template was hybridized with phosphorylated primers and the bottom or top strand selection primer. The mutant strand was synthesized by T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase. The mutant reactions were transformed into BMH 71-18mutS competent cells, which were selected by GeneEditor antibiotic and ampicillin once plated in LB agar. The mutant clones were transformed into JM109 competent cells and confirmed by DNA sequence. RNase protection assays (RPA) were used to measure DHPR α1S mRNA concentrations in C2C12 cells. In vitro transcription probe labeling was performed with SP6 RNA polymerase (Maxiscript Kit, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and [32P]UTP (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). The reaction was gel purified and the labeled probe (2 × 104 cpm) was hybridized at 56 °C overnight with 25 μg of total RNA from mouse skeletal muscle. After RNase digestion, the protected fragment was separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and exposed to x-ray film. The radiolabeled RNA century marker (Ambion) was loaded on the same gel as molecular weight marker. RPA was performed with total RNA extracted from C2C12 cells. The DNA template for detecting DHPR α1S mRNA (accession number L06234: 1461–1600 bp) in skeletal muscle and C2C12 cells were prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR, cloned into pCRII vector, and linearized with BsrDI (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). DHPR α1S probe (140 bp plus 82-bp vector fragment) was labeled with [32P]UTP byin vitro transcription. The probe for 28 S rRNA consists of 115 bp plus the 67-bp vector fragment. Both the pTRI-RNA-28S antisense control template and the RNA century marker template set (Ambion Inc.) were also labeled by the in vitro transcription method using different dilutions of [32P]UTP. Nuclear proteins from myoblast and myotubes of C2C12 cells were extracted as described (23Zheng Z. Messi M.L. Delbono O. Mech. Aging Dev. 2001; 122: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were collected and washed in Tris-buffered saline. The cell pellets were resuspended in cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by gentle pipetting. After swelling on ice for 15 min, 10% Nonidet P-40 solution was added and vortexed for 10 s. After centrifugation, the nuclear pellets were suspended in cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and rocked at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined with Coomassie Plus Protein Reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.). Sense and antisense DNA oligonucleotides (from −122 to −95) were synthesized and purified by PAGE (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Both single strand oligos were annealed to form a double stranded DNA (D8 probe), which was end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, WI) and [γ-32P]ATP (7000 mCi/mmol; ICN) and used as a probe for the gel shift assay. The nuclear proteins (5 μg) were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in a total 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid strand DNA at room temperature for 10 min, labeled probe was added and incubated for 20 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 10% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized in x-ray film. In competition analysis, nuclear extracts were incubated for 10 min with unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes or competitors in gel mobility shift assays (only the sequence of the top strand is shown): D8 probe, 5′-GATGGGGATGTCACCGGCTGGACTGGAA-3′, D8-MUT oligo, 5′-GATGGGGATGTCTGCGGCTGGACTGGAA-3′, CREB consensus oligonucleotide, 5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′ (Promega, Madison, WI). C2C12 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, treated with 1% digitonin buffer (1% digitonin, 185 mm KCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) on ice, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The lysate (500 μg of total cellular protein) was precleared by adding 0.5 μg of the appropriate control IgG (normal goat IgG) together with 20 μl of the resuspended volume of the appropriate agarose conjugate (Protein G-agarose). After centrifugation at 2,500 rpm (1,000 × g), the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube on ice. Goat anti-DHPR α1SN-19 primary antibody (1 μg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added and incubated. Only goat IgG was added to the control tube. The resuspended volume of the Protein G-agarose (20 μl) was added to each tube and incubated at 4 °C on a rotating device overnight. After centrifugation (2,500 rpm, 1,000 × g) the pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 20 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer. All samples were boiled for 2–3 min and analyzed in 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Rainbow Molecular Weight Markers (Amersham Biosciences) were loaded. Proteins were transferred from the gel to the nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the nitrocellulose membrane in 5% milk, Tris buffered-saline Tween for 30–60 min at room temperature. Incubation in the primary antibody (1:100 diluted in blot buffer) was done for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times for 5 min each with Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. The membrane was incubated with anti-goat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, washed, and finally incubated in ECL reagent (Pierce) and visualized in x-ray films. Data have been analyzed using Student's t test or analysis of variance. A value ofp < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. with the number of observations (n). We investigated the effects of IGF-1 on DHPR α1subunit protein, DHPR α1S mRNA, and the role of IGF-1 in the basal expression of the DHPR α1 subunit, to identify the element(s) involved in the IGF-1-mediated regulation ofDHPR α1S expression. We also defined the transcription factor(s) critical for IGF-1 effects on DHPRα1S promoter-luciferase fusion plasmids, and examined the functional effects of antisense oligonucleotides for this transcription factor on charge movement. We have previously demonstrated that IGF-1 enhances DHPR α1S protein expression (6Wang Z.-M. Messi M.L. Renganathan M. Delbono O. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) by increasing nuclear transcriptional activity in skeletal muscle (31Zheng Z. Wang Z.-M. Delbono O. 31st Annual Meeting, San Diego, CA, November 10–15, 2001. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D. C.2001: 266Google Scholar). To study the specific regulatory elements involved in IGF-1-mediated enhancement ofDHPR α1S, we examined first the effects of IGF-1 on the levels of expression of the channel subunit in C2C12 cells. To this end, a combination of immunoprecipitation and Western blot was used to improve the signal of the DHPR α1 subunit. Repeated determinations (n = 4) revealed that the DHPR α1 subunit expresses in myotubes and that IGF-1 increases the expression of DHPR α1 subunit protein. The IGF-1 concentration (20 ng/ml) and the exposure time (3 days in differentiation medium) used in the present work have been found optimal to enhance DHPR α1S expression in rat skeletal muscle primary culture (6Wang Z.-M. Messi M.L. Renganathan M. Delbono O. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a band at 210 kDa corresponding to the DHPR α1 subunit in C2C12 myotubes. The size of the band was determined using molecular weight markers as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” The size of the DHPR α1subunit band is similar to that reported previously (32De Jongh K.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16371-16377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This band is enhanced in myotubes treated with IGF-1 but not in cells treated with IGF-1 plus the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor I-OMe-AG538 (25 μm). It is also apparent that the inhibitor by itself does not modify the expression of the DHPR α1 subunit (Fig. 1). For these experiments, 500 μg of total proteins extracted from C2C12 cells lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with goat anti-DHPR α1S. The precipitates were analyzed in SDS-PAGE gels and detected by Western blot as described above (“Experimental Procedures”). To explain the increase in DHPR α1protein we examined whether IGF-1 enhances DHPRα1S mRNA in C2C12 cells. Repeated RPA analysis revealed that a 140-bp protected fragment corresponding to DHPR α1S mRNA was present in total RNA samples from C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 2). Molecular weight was determined using radiolabeled RNA markers loaded on the same gel as described above. RPA was performed using specific cRNA probes for mouse DHPRα1S and 28 S rRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). DHPR α1S expression in C2C12 myotubes was recorded in four experiments in which 25 μg of RNA from proliferating and differentiated cells corresponding to the same cell passage were analyzed. These results together with data on mouse skeletal muscle (24Zheng Z. Wang Z.-M. Delbono O. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) support the concept that differentiation provides the conditions for DHPR α1S expression. Fig. 2 also shows that IGF-1 significantly increased DHPR α1S expression, a phenomenon that can be prevented by I-OMe-AG538. No effects of this agent by itself were recorded by DHPR α1Sexpression (Fig. 2). To analyze the DHPR α1S 5′-flanking region elements that may play a role in controlling IGF-1-dependent enhancement of DHPRα1S gene transcription, a gene chimera was created by cloning the 5′-flanking sequence and a portion of exon 1 of the DHPR α1 subunit (−1076 to +129) upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. Chimera deletion constructs were made starting at the 5′-end of the chimera and progressing in the 3′ direction. Full and deletion constructs were subcloned into pGL3/basic plasmid and transfected into C2C12 cells. The pGL3/basic vector containing the luciferase reporter gene and lacking the DHPR α1SDNA was used as a control. Fig. 3illustrates the full-length 5′-flanking region (−1076/+128)-luciferase reporter gene and 3 deletion constructs. The most distal 5′-end nucleotide from the transcription start site identifies each construct. The expression of Luc/P-1076 has been shown to be dependent on cell differentiation and subtype (24Zheng Z. Wang Z.-M. Delbono O. J.

Physiol. 2002; 540: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) we have shown that the maximum luciferase activity was recorded at day 5 in differentiation medium in transfected C2C12 cells with the Luc/P-1076 construct. In the present work, we selected day 3 for luciferase activity recording because the C2C12 cells exposed to IGF-1 started to detach from the bottom of the chamber thereafter. Fig. 3 shows the relative luciferase activity recorded in the four 5′-flanking promoter-luciferase gene constructs transfected simultaneously into different groups of C2C12 cells. The relative luciferase activity was normalized to the Luc/P-1076 construct luminescence signal. Luciferase activity was much greater for Luc/P-1076 than for any of the other three constructs (p < 0.001) (n = 5). Enhancer and repressor elements in the 1.2 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the DHPR α1S have been discussed previously (24Zheng Z. Wang Z.-M. Delbono O. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 also shows that IGF-1 increases significantly the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the four chimeric constructs and that even the shortest construct (Luc/P-146) tested exhibits IGF-1 potentiation. Recombinant IGF-1 has been used in the experiments described above, however, C2C12 cells can synthesize and secrete IGF-1 and express IGF-1R (35Cheng Z.Q. Adi S., Wu, N.Y. Hsiao D. Woo E.J.

Therefore, we examined whether endogenous, in addition to exogenous, recombinant IGF-1 modulate the expression ofDHPR α1S. To this end, untreated and IGF-1-treated cells expressing the full promoter-luciferase construct (Luc/P-1076) were examined for the expression of DHPR α1S in the presence or absence of 10–100 μm I-OMe-AG538 (36Blum G.

A significant factor contributing to the difference in oncogenicity may be the low levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I membrane expression in Ad12-transformed BRK cells as compared with those in Ad5-transformed BRK cells, which presumably results in escape from killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here we show that, in addition to the decreased levels of expression of the MHC class I heavy chain and the peptide transporter Tap-2, the expression levels of the chaperone Tapasin and the immunoproteasome components MECL-1, PA28-α, and PA28-β also are much lower in Ad12- than in Ad5-transformed BRK cells. The low expression levels of these proteins may contribute to the escape from killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, because the generation of optimal peptides and loading of these peptides on MHC class I require these components. Increased levels of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 protein and expression of IFN regulatory factor-7 were found in Ad5- versus Ad12-transformed BRK cells. Therefore, the critical alteration leading to the plethora of differences may be an interferon (-related) effect.

The lifespan of primary cells is normally restricted to a defined number of cell divisions, but after transformation the cells usually become immortal. Another frequently observed parameter of transformation is the ability to grow in an unrestricted fashion in a living organism, either in the absence of the T-cell immune defense (nude mice) or in the presence of immune defense (immunocompetent animals). Because transformed cells usually express neoantigens, oncogenicity in immunocompetent organisms requires escape from the T-cell immune surveillance by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. A suitable model to study differences in oncogenicity is the adenovirus transformation system (1Bernards R. van der Eb A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 783: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The transforming activity of adenoviruses (Ad)1 is a function of the early region 1 (E1) of the viral genome, which encodes the E1A and E1B proteins (2Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Heijneker H.L. Nature. 1974; 251: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Primary baby rat kidney (BRK) cell cultures can be transformed by most human Ad serotypes, but only cells transformed by the oncogenic subgroup A adenoviruses are oncogenic in syngeneic animals. Studies on the differences between cells transformed by the non-oncogenic Ad5 and oncogenic Ad12 have led to the identification of a number of differentially expressed cellular genes that could explain the differences in oncogenicity of these cells. Among these are the MHC class I genes, which are down-regulated in Ad12-transformed cells (3Schrier P.I. Bernards R. Vaessen R.T. Houweling A. van der Eb A.J. Nature. 1983; 305: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Absence of MHC class I antigens might be particularly important with respect to the escape from the T-cell immune surveillance (4Bernards R. Schrier P.I. Houweling A. Bos J.L. van der Eb A.J. Zijlstra M. Melief C.J. Nature. 1983; 305: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As a result of the lack of MHC class I membrane expression, viral peptides cannot be presented to the immune system, which causes these cells to escape from elimination by cytotoxic T cells. Down-regulation of membrane expression of MHC class I protein is caused in part by decreased levels of transcription of the MHC class I heavy chain genes (5Ackrill A.M. Blair G.E. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 483-487PubMed Google Scholar, 6Friedman D.J. Ricciardi R.P. Virology. 1988; 165: 303-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Meijer I. van Dam H. Boot A.J. Bos J.L. Zantema A. van der Eb A.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 911-916PubMed Google Scholar) but is also because of the low expression level of the Tap protein (8Rotem-Yehudar R. Winograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Proffitt J.A. Blair G.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Low Tap protein levels severely limit the amount of peptides available for presentation by MHC class I molecules (10Van Kaer L. Ashton-Rickardt P.G. Ploegh H.L. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1992; 71: 1205-1214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Because only trimeric complexes consisting of MHC class I heavy chain, light chain (β2-microglobulin), and peptide are stable, limited availability of peptides severely affects the amount of membrane-expressed MHC class I antigens (10Van Kaer L.

The availability of optimal peptides might be limited further by the low expression levels of two γ-interferon-inducible components of the proteasome, LMP-2 and LMP-7, in Ad12-transformed cells (15Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Proffitt J.A. Blair G.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In an attempt to restore MHC class I membrane expression in Ad12-transformed cells, we have generated in the present study Ad12-transformed BRK cells that are stably transfected with a plasmid encoding RT1-Au, the MHC class I heavy chain of the rat strain used for these studies, and a plasmid encoding Tap-2. Despite the fact that the genes were expressed as RNA, these cells did not show an increase in MHC class I membrane expression. Additional characterization of Ad5- and Ad12-transformed BRK cells revealed that the chaperone protein Tapasin, as well as MECL-1 and PA28-α and -β, three proteins involved in the generation of peptides that can be presented on MHC class I (16Stoltze L.

Today. 2000; 21: 317-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), are expressed at higher levels in Ad5- than in Ad12-transformed BRK cells. We present evidence that differential expression of this set of genes can be explained by differences in the activity of STAT-1, a transcription factor involved in the control of expression of these genes (17Chatterjee-Kishore M.

Marie I. Smith E. Prakash A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A partial RT1-AucDNA, RT16, has been described (24Mauxion F. Sobczak J. Kress M. Immunogenetics. 1989; 29: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cloning of the 5′ part was based on the homology of RT1-A. RT16 lacks only bp 1040–1042 of the RT1.Al, whereas 17 of 18 bp around the RT1.Altranslational start codon are identical with the corresponding region of RT1.Aa. Therefore, an upstream oligo, U1, corresponding to the RT1.Al sequence, and a downstream oligo, D1, derived from RT16 (24Mauxion F. Sobczak J. Kress M. Immunogenetics. 1989; 29: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), were used for RT-PCR of total RNA from the Ad5-transformed BRK cell line BXc22, which expresses high levels of RT1-Au (see Fig. 1 B) (25Schouten G.J. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1498-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The PCR product of 473 bp was subcloned in the AT vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), resulting in PCR2.1-RT1-Au 5′. The sequence of two independently isolated clones was identical, and this sequence was submitted to GenBankTM (accession number AF400159). The 489-bp EcoRI fragment of plasmid pCR2.1-RT1-Au 5′ was inserted in the EcoRI site of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), resulting in pBluescript-RT1-Au 5′. The full-length RT1-AucDNA was constructed in a two-step procedure, inserting the 504-bpStyI/PstI fragment of RT16 in theStyI/PstI sites of pBluescript-RT1-Au5′ and subsequently the 783-bp PstI fragment of RT16. The pcDNA3.1-RT1-Au expression vector was made by inserting the HindIII/XbaI fragment of pBluescript-RT1-Au, which encodes full-length RT1-Au, in the HindIII and XbaI site of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The sequence of pBluescript-RT1-Au was reconfirmed. The rat Tap-2 expression plasmid was constructed by cloning theBamHI-XhoI fragment from pBluescript-rTap-2 (a kind gift from Dr. F. Momburg, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany) into the BamHI and XhoI sites of plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The mouse Tapasin expression construct pREP8-mTapasin (26Grandea III, A.G.

Antibodies against total STAT-1 (9172) and phosphorylated STAT-1 (9171) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). BRK cells transformed with the early region 1 of Ad5 or Ad12 were described elsewhere (25Schouten G.J. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1498-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Monoclonal cell lines 33RT60 and 33RT61 were established by transfection of Ad12E1-transformed BRK cell line RICc33 with plasmid pcDNA3.1-RT1-Au and subsequent selection for G418 resistance. Polyclonal cell lines expressing Tapasin, Tap-2, or both proteins and control lines were established by transfection of 33RT60 with the empty expression vector pcDNA3.1, the plasmid pREP8-mTapasin, or the plasmid pcDNA3.1-Tap-2 or co-transfected with both expression plasmids. The pECV5 plasmid, which encodes the Hygromycin resistance gene, was included in all these transfections, and subsequently cells were selected for hygromycin resistance. AdE1-transformed cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and antibiotics. U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal-calf serum and antibiotics. Tissue culture media and sera were purchased from Invitrogen. All tissue culture plastics were obtained from Greiner. Treatment with 100 units/ml IFN-γ (Invitrogen) or 1000 units/ml TNF-α (Sigma) was performed for the indicated periods of time. Transfections were performed using the TFX-50 transfection protocol according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega) or using the calcium-phosphate protocol as described previously (32van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Total cell extracts were fractionated by SDS/PAGE on 10% or 12.6% gels. Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and incubated with specific primary antibodies as indicated. As secondary antibodies horseradish-peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson) were used. The bound antibodies were visualized with the ECL detection system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Exponentially growing cells were labeled for 1–6 h with [35S]methionine and lysed in IPB.14 as described previously (33Schrier P.I. Van Den Elsen P.J. Hertoghs J.J. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1979; 99: 372-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MHC class I proteins were immunoprecipitated with the mouse monoclonal antibody U9F4 (27Stet R.J.M. Zantema A. van Laar T. de Waal R.M.W. Vaessen L.M.B. Rozing J. Transplant. Proc. 1987; XIX: 3004-3005Google Scholar), and Tapasin was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against mouse Tapasin (29Suh W.K. Derby M.A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Schoenhals G.J. Fruh K. Berzofsky J.A. Williams D.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1530-1540PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels (Tapasin) or 12.6% gels (MHC class I). Proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells as described previously (34Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). poly(A)+ enrichment was performed using the mRNA isolation kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 10 μg of total RNA or 5 μg of poly(A)+ enriched RNA was size fractionated on a 1% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gel by electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond filters (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were hybridized for RT1-Au with the 0.9-kbPvuII/EcoRI fragment of the pcDNA3.1-RT1-Au expression vector, with the 0.8-kbKpnI/SacI fragment of pBluescript-rTap-2 for Tap-2, with the 1.3-kb HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pREP8-mTapasin for Tapasin, and with the PstI fragment of the rat GAPDH cDNA for GAPDH. For RT-PCR RNA isolation and cDNA preparation were as described previously by Martens et al.(35Martens J.H. Verlaan M. Kalkhoven E. Dorsman J.C. Zantema A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2598-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The primers used were as follows: as control rat elongation factor 1, AAGCTGAGCGTGAGCGTG and CGGGTGACTTTCCATCCC (464 bp); rat IRF-7, GCAGCAGTGGTTCTGAAC and GGCGACAAGGATCACCAC (293 bp); rat IFN-β, GTGACGGGTGCATCACCTCC and CCACTGCCCTCTCCATCGAC (153 bp); IFN-α (consensus primers annealing with all mouse IFNα subtypes), AGGGCTCTCCAGAYTTCTGCTCTG and ATGGCTAGRCTCTGTGCTTTCCT (524 bp) (36Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were harvested by mild trypsinization. Approximately 2 × 105 cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with 30 μl of U9F4 hybridoma tissue culture supernatant 1:1 diluted with PBA (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin). The cells were washed twice with PBA and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (Jackson) for 30 min on ice. Controls were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody only. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBA, and the fluorescence intensity was analyzed by the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). The rat MHC class I protein RT1-Au is strongly down-regulated in Ad12-transformed BRK cells, which is assumed to contribute to the oncogenicity of these cells in syngeneic Wag-Rij rats (3Schrier P.I. Bernards R. Vaessen R.T. Houweling A. van der Eb A.J. Nature. 1983; 305: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In an attempt to functionally restore RT1 membrane expression, we have cloned the cDNA encoding the major RT1 allele expressed in this rat strain, RT1-Au. The RT1-Au expression construct was sequence-verified, and the protein could be detected after transient transfection in U2OS cells (Fig. 1 A). Contrary to the result in U2OS cells, stable overexpression of RT1-AumRNA in Ad12-transformed BRK cells (Fig. 1 B) does not lead to high protein levels (Fig. 1 C). In 23 independent monoclonal cell lines, no increase in RT1-Au protein levels was observed. This result suggests that in these Ad12-transformed cells additional alterations impair the formation of stable MHC class I molecules presenting peptides at the cell surface. Stable MHC class I protein expression requires the availability of small peptides that can be presented by the heavy chain molecule (12Townsend A. Elliott T. Cerundolo V. Foster L. Barber B. Tse A. Cell. 1990; 62: 285-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 13Schumacher T.N. Heemels M.T. Neefjes J.J. Kast W.M. Melief C.J. Ploegh H.L.

A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Peptide loading is a function of the Tap proteins, which are known to be hardly expressed in Ad12-transformed mouse cells (8Rotem-Yehudar R. Winograd S. Sela S. Coligan J.E. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Restoring Tap-2, but not Tap-1, partially restored MHC class I membrane expression in the published mouse model. Fig. 2 A shows that the Tap-2 protein levels in Ad5-transformed BRK cells are also much higher than in Ad12-transformed BRK cells. As a control, we identified the levels of NF-κB1-p105 (Fig. 2 A), which, as we showed previously, are identical in Ad5- and Ad12-transformed BRK cells (25Schouten G.J. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1498-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The difference in Tap-2 level is in line with the difference in Tap-2 mRNA expression (Fig. 2 C). Another protein involved in MHC class I membrane expression (38Garbi N. Tan P. Diehl A.D. Chambers B.J. Ljunggren H.-G. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) is Tapasin, a chaperone protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (39Grandea III, A.G. Golovina T.N. Hamilton S.E. Sriram V. Spies T. Brutkiewicz R.R. Harty J.T. Eisenlohr L.C. Van Kaer L. Immunity. 2000; 13: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, this protein is a candidate that might be involved in differential MHC class I membrane expression in Ad-transformed cells. Hence, we determined the Tapasin protein levels in Ad5- and Ad12-transformed BRK cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, Tapasin is expressed to a higher level in Ad5- than in Ad12-transformed BRK cells. This is probably because of the difference in Tapasin mRNA expression (Fig. 2 C). To test whether Tap-2 and Tapasin might be sufficient to restore MHC class I membrane expression, polyclonal cell lines that stably overexpress Tap-2, Tapasin, or both proteins were established using 33RT60, the Ad12-transformed BRK cell line stably overexpressing the RT1-Au mRNA, as the parental cell line. Tapasin protein levels in these stable cell lines (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and5) were somewhat higher than the endogenous Tapasin protein levels in Ad5-transformed cells (lane 1). Tap-2 protein levels (lanes 3 and 5) were not as high as in Ad5-transformed cells but were strongly increased compared with the level in the parental cell line transfected with the empty expression construct (lane 2). However, no increase in MHC class I membrane expression was observed in any of these polyclonal cell lines, compared with that in the parental control line (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were found in a second set of polyclonal cell lines (data not shown). Therefore, RT1-Au, Tap-2, and Tapasin are not sufficient to restore MHC class I membrane expression in Ad12-transformed cells. The capacity of these cells to express RT1-Au was demonstrated by the stimulation of the expression by IFN-γ (Fig. 3 B, B4). It is well established that many genes encoding antigen presentation factors are targets for IFN-γ. As expected, IFN-γ treatment could restore MHC class I membrane expression in Ad12-transformed cells (Fig. 4, A1), to a level comparable with the MHC class I expression in Ad5-transformed cells (Fig. 4,A2). A possible explanation for the difference between Ad5- and Ad12-transformed cells could be that Ad5-transformed cells produce interferon. Therefore we tested whether the conditioned medium from Ad5-transformed BRK cells could induce MHC class I membrane expression in Ad12-transformed cells. As shown in Fig. 4 B induction was always observed although the magnitude of the effect depends on the conditioned medium used. Some conditioned medium led to an induction comparable with the effect of IFN-γ. Analysis of media from Ad5-transformed mouse cells showed that these cells do not produce mouse IFN-γ (data not shown). Previously, it has been shown that Ad5-transformed cloned rat embryo fibroblasts, in contrast to Ad12-transformed fibroblasts, express IFN-β mRNA (40Nielsch U. Zimmer S.G. Babiss L.E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4169-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 41Adami G.R. Babiss L.E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested our panel of Ad-transformed BRK clones for expression of IFN-β by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4 C). Expression of IFN-β could be demonstrated in two of the three Ad5-transformed BRK cells but not in the Ad12-transformed BRK cells. Analysis of the expression of IFN-α is hampered as for rat IFN-α only a single cDNA has been published (42Dijkema R. Pouwels P. de Reus A. Schellekens H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 1227-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) whereas IFN-α consists of a large family of closely related members in mice (23Levy D.E. Marie I. Smith E. Prakash A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A comparable intensity was found for all cell lines tested with the strongest signal with a degenerate primer set for mice IFN-α (36Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that IFN-β could be responsible for the conditioned medium effect. To determine whether the amounts of IFN-β present in the conditioned medium of Ad5-transformed BRK cells are indeed responsible for the induction of MHC class I in Ad12-transformed BRK cells, an IFN-β neutralizing antibody (31Ruuls S.R. de Labie M.C. Weber K.S. Botman C.A. Groenestein R.J. Dijkstra C.D. Olsson T. van der Meide P.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5721-5731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the conditioned medium. The neutralizing antibody reduced the conditioned medium effect to 57% (data not shown). Interestingly, this was found for the conditioned medium from the Ad5-transformed BRK clone 22. This indicates that although we fail to detect IFN-β expression by quantitative RT-PCR, the amount of IFN-β produced by this cell line is still of significant biological relevance. The inability to observe an effective block by anti IFN-β of MHC class I membrane expression in Ad5 cells (data not shown) might imply that Ad5-transformed cells produce other MHC class I inducing cytokines. The ability of interferons to induce MHC class I antigen suggests that IFN-target genes might be expressed differentially in Ad5- and Ad12-transformed BRK cells. Known IFN-γ target genes involved in antigen presentation are the immunoproteasome subunit MECL-1 (43Nandi D. Jiang H. Monaco J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2361-2364PubMed Google Scholar) and the proteasome activator subunits PA28-α and -β (44Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 45Stohwasser R. Standera S. Peters I. Kloetzel P.M. Groettrup M. Eur. J.

Nature. 2000; 408: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). These proteins were found to be expressed to a much higher level in Ad5- than in Ad12-transformed BRK cells (Fig. 5). Previous studies already demonstrated that LMP-2 and -7, two IFN-γ-inducible proteasome subunits, are also expressed at much higher levels in Ad5- than in Ad12-transformed cells (15Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 499-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Differential regulation of LMP-2 and -7, MECL-1, and PA28-α and -β could imply that Ad5-transformed BRK cells have higher proteasome levels than Ad12-transformed BRK cells. However, this is not the case, because the constitutive proteasome subunit MC-3 is expressed somewhat higher in Ad12- than in Ad5-transformed BRK cells (Fig. 5). Constitutive activation of IFN-inducible genes in Ad5-transformed cells suggests a difference in the activity of IFN signaling pathways between Ad5- and Ad12-transformed cells. Hence, we studied whether IFN-γ treatment could enhance the protein levels of Tap-2, MECL-1, and PA28-α and -β in Ad5- and Ad12-transformed BRK cell lines. Cells were treated with IFN-γ for 7 h (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2 and8), 24 h (lanes 5 and 11), or 48 h (lanes 6 and 12) or were left untreated (lanes 1 and 7). As expected, IFN-γ could indeed induce Tap-2, MECL-1, and PA28-α and -β expression in the Ad12-transformed cells (Fig. 6 A) (data not shown). After 48 h of IFN-γ treatment, protein levels of these antigen presentation components in Ad12-transformed cells we"

Because PKCβ mRNAs share common sequences other than the PKCβII exon encoding a different carboxyl terminus, we examined PKCβII mRNA for a cis-acting region that could confer glucose-induced destabilization. A β-globin/growth hormone reporter con struct containing the PKCβII exon was transfected into human aorta and rat vascular smooth muscle cells (A10) to follow glucose-induced destabilization. Glucose (25 mm) exposure destabilized PKCβII chimeric mRNA but not control mRNA. Deletion analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays followed by UV cross-linking experiments demonstrated that a region introduced by inclusion of the βII exon was required to confer destabilization. Although a cis-acting element mapped to 38 nucleotides within the βII exon was necessary to bestow destabilization, it was not sufficient by itself to confer complete mRNA destabilization. Yet, in intact cells antisense oligonucleotides complementary to this region blocked glucose-induced destabilization. These results suggest that this region must function in context with other sequence elements created by exon inclusion involved in affecting mRNA stability. In summary, inclusion of an exon that encodes PKCβII mRNA introduces a cis-acting region that confers destabilization to the mRNA in response to glucose.

Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar). The PKC isozymes exhibit differential cellular distribution and substrate specificity. The conventional PKC isozymes, which are Ca2+-dependent and activated by phospholipid and diacylglycerol, include PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ. PKCβI and PKCβII are encoded by the same gene, and are translated from alternatively spliced products of PKCβ pre-mRNA. The inclusion of the PKCβII exon in the 3′-region through alternative splicing results in the PKCβII mRNA. This pattern of splicing generates a stop codon at the βII-βI boundary such that the βI exon, with its coding sequence and 3′-UTR, now becomes the 3′-UTR of PKCβII mRNA (Fig. 1). As a result, the PKCβI and PKCβII mRNAs differ only by the sequence of the included PKCβII exon, and the proteins differ only by their carboxyl-terminal 50–52 amino acids, respectively (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that acute hyperglycemia down-regulates PKCβII, but not PKCβI, at the mRNA and protein levels in vascular smooth muscle cells (2Patel N.A. Chalfant C.E. Yamamoto M. Watson J.E. Eichler D.C. Cooper D.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism by which elevated glucose down-regulates PKCβII expression in vascular smooth muscle cells, earlier studies were carried out to determine at what level suppression of PKCβII expression occurred. These studies clearly demonstrated that high glucose (10–30 mm), at levels that commonly occur in hyperglycemia associated with diabetes mellitus, exerted some regulation at the level of transcription, but that the most dominant level of regulation occurred post-transcriptionally through increased destabilization of PKCβII mRNA via a cytoplasmic nuclease activity (2Patel N.A. Chalfant C.E. Yamamoto M. Watson J.E. Eichler D.C. Cooper D.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PKCβI and other isozyme-specific PKC mRNAs were not destabilized. The effect of elevated glucose (25 mm) was independent of osmotic controls, because mannitol did not down-regulate PKCβII mRNA expression (2Patel N.A. Chalfant C.E. Yamamoto M. Watson J.E. Eichler D.C. Cooper D.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 3Cooper D.R. Khalakdina A. Watson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have also shown that PKCβI and PKCβII enzymes have opposite signaling roles in cell division, where PKCβII signaling suppresses vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation by attenuating G1/S transition and high glucose treatment, which down-regulates PKCβII mRNA and protein, and stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (4Yamamoto M.

Watson J.E. Cooper D.R. Am. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 279: C587-C595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High glucose also suppressed insulin effects on glucose uptake, another PKCβII-dependent process (3Cooper D.R. Khalakdina A. Watson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The regulation of mRNA stability has emerged as an important mechanism for controlling gene expression. Depending on the system, half-lives of mRNA range from a few minutes to days. The decay rates of many eukaryotic mRNAs are regulated by developmental or environmental stimuli. Most of the mechanisms that control mRNA stability share common features, and determinants of mRNA stability have been shown to reside in the 5′-cap, 5′-UTR, coding region, poly(A)-tail, and the 3′-UTR (or the AU-rich elements) such that each may play some role in regulating mRNA decay rates (6Amara F.M.

Although it is now clear that the decreased stability of PKCβII mRNA correlates with cell exposure to high concentrations of glucose, the molecular mechanism contributing to the regulation of PKCβII expression by altering its mRNA stability remained to be defined. Here, using deletion and competition analyses, we identify a ∼38-nucleotide sequence within a region of secondary structure in the alternatively spliced exon that binds factors in vitro in a manner dependent on the sequence and the availability of factors present only in the cytosol of glucose-treated cell extracts. The degree to which protein-RNA complex was formed was dependent on the presence of the 38-nt region. These data suggest that insertion of the βII exon specifies glucose responsive destabilization of PKCβII mRNA. Because PKCβII and PKCβI mRNAs differ only by the inclusion of the PKCβII exon through alternative splicing, we propose that a cis-acting region introduced by inclusion of the PKCβII exon defines glucose-mediated mRNA destabilization. To our knowledge this is the first characterization of an element that is introduced by alternative splicing that allows for metabolite regulation of stability of a specific mRNA. The vascular smooth muscle cell line (A10, ATCC CRL 1476), derived from rat aorta, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 5.5 mm glucose) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units penicillin G, and 100 μg of streptomycin sulfate/ml, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere in either 6-well or 100-mm plates. Cells were grown to >90% confluency and medium was changed every 4 days. Cell synchronization was achieved by serum deprivation (0.5% fetal bovine serum) for 48 h as demonstrated previously (12Ross R. Nist C. Kariya B. Rivest M.J,. Raines E. Callis J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 97: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Primary cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) were grown in smooth muscle growth medium (Clonetics) containing 5.5 mm glucose, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 390 ng/ml dexamethasone, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 50 ng/ml amphotericin-B at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Cells were grown to >90% confluency and medium was changed every 5 days. The isotopes [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]UTP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from ICN Biochemicals. Oligo probe labeling kit (Prime-a-Gene) was purchased from Promega. Riboscribe T7 RNA probe synthesis kit and Ampliscribe T7 transcription kit were purchased from Epicentre Technologies. RNase A, RNase T1, heparin, and RNase inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. A10 cells were grown and synchronized by serum deprivation for 48 h in either 6-well or 100-mm plates. The pβG or pβG-PKCβII expression vectors were transfected in serum-free medium with the Lipofectin-DNA complex. Lipofectin reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. Following 4 h of incubation, the Lipofectin-DNA complex was washed off with 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered solution and replaced with fresh medium containing 2% serum. For stably transfected A10 cell selection, 0.7 mg/ml G-418 was added to the media. It was changed every 4 days, and 10–14 days later the colonies were pooled and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal bovine serum) with 0.2 mg/ml G-418. pβG-PKCβII stable transfectants and pβG stable transfected A10 cells were plated into 100-mm dishes. 50 μg/ml DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) dissolved in 95% ethanol was added to the plates 30 min prior to the treatments and the 0-h RNA sample was isolated. 25 mm glucose was added to the glucose-treated plates. RNA samples were isolated from normal (5.5 mm glucose) and glucose-treated (25 mm glucose) pβG-PKCβII and pβG dishes at 2, 4, 6, 10, and 18 h. In a separate control, an equivalent amount of 95% ethanol was added. Total cellular RNA was isolated from 100-mm plates using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). RNA samples (10 μg) were prepared in formamide, formaldehyde, and 1× MOPS, and fractionated on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels. Ethidium bromide was added in the loading buffer for visualization and quantitation of 18 S and 28 S RNA. After fractionation, the integrity and loading of RNA was assessed under UV light (12Ross R.

The size-fractionated RNA was then capillary transferred to Hybond membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and cross-linked to membranes by baking at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 2 h. Membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 2 × 107 cpm of the β-globin probe (labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by nick translation as described (16Chalfant C.E. Mischak H. Watson J.E. Winkler B.C.

Membranes were washed with high stringency conditions; label was detected and quantitated using a AmershamBiosciences PhosphorImaging system. Total RNA was isolated from control or glucose-treated A10 cells or aortic smooth muscle cells and 2 μg was used to synthesize first strand cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen pre-amplification kit). The upstream sense primer for β-globin was (5′-GCATCTGTCCAGTGAGGAGAA-3′) and the downstream antisense primer was (5′-AACCAGCACGTTGCCCAGGAG-3′). Sense and antisense primers for β-actin (number 5402-3) were obtained from Clontech. To detect PKCβI and -βII, the upstream sense primer corresponded to the C4 kinase domain common to both PKCβI and PKCβII (5′-CGTATATGCGGCCGCGTTGTGGGCCTGAAGGGG-3′) and the downstream antisense primer was specific for PKCβI (5′-GCATTCTAGTCGACAAGAGTTTGTCAGTGGGAG-3′) (16Chalfant C.E.

PCR was performed using platinum Taq DNA polymerase (from Invitrogen) on 10% of the reverse transcriptase reaction product. Following amplification in a Biometra Trioblock thermocycler (β-globin: 94 °C, 1 min; 58 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 3 min for 30 cycles; PKCβI and -βII: 95 °C, 30 s; 68 °C, 2 min for 35 cycles), 20% of the amplified products were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel or 5% of products were resolved on 6% PAGE gels and detected by silver staining. The PCR reaction was optimized for linear range amplification to allow for quantification of products. The pRSV-βG vector (obtained from Dr. Norman C. Curthoys, Colorado State University) was digested with HindIII and BglII to obtain a 507-bp fragment, which was isolated from agarose gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The β-globin probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Prime-a-Gene (Promega) to a specific activity of 109 disintegrations/min. The parent vector pβG contains the strong viral promoter derived from the long terminal repeat of the Rous sarcoma virus followed by the transcriptional start site, the 5′-nontranslated region, the entire coding sequence, and two introns from the rabbit β-globin gene, a multicloning site containing four unique restriction sites, and the 3′-nontranslated region and polyadenylation site of the bovine growth hormone (17Haller H. Baur E. Quass P. Behrend M. Lindshau C. Distler A. Luft F.C. Kidney Intl. 1995; 47: 1057-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It carries neomycin and ampicillin resistance. The 404-bp PKCβII product corresponding to the 216-bp βII exon and flanking regions was obtained by PCR amplification using sense primer to the upstream PKCβ common C4 domain containing theSpeI site (5′-CGTATATACTAGTGTTGTGGGCCTGAAGGGGAACG-3′) and antisense primer to the βIV5 domain containing the XbaI site (5′-TGCCTGGTGAACTCTTTGTCGAGAAGCTCT-3′) such that the exon-included PKCβII mRNA was amplified. The insert contained 70 bp of the C4 exon and 118 bp of the βI exon common to both PKCβI and PKCβII in addition to the 216-bp exon specific for PKCβII. After size fractionation it was extracted from the gel (Qiagen QIAquick gel extraction kit), digested with SpeI and XbaI, and purified. The PKCβII cDNA was ligated into theSpeI and XbaI sites of the multicloning region of pβG vector. The construct, pβG-PKCβII, was verified by restriction mapping and dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Using PCR primers for C4 (last common domain) as sense primer with the SpeI site synthesized upstream (5′-CGTATATACTAGTGTTGTGGGCCTGAAGGGGAACG-3′) and for βII exon antisense primer with the XbaI site synthesized downstream (5′-CGGAGGTCTACACATCTACTTTCTAGAAGCTCT-3′), PKCβII exon without the -βI exon (286 bp product) was amplified. This insert contained 70 bp corresponding to the C4 exon and the entire PKCβII exon. The product was gel purified and ligated into the SpeI andXbaI sites of the multicloning region of pβG vector. The construct, pβG-PKCβIIΔβI, was verified by restriction mapping. The region of instability comprising 38 nucleotides was synthesized with the SpeI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites to facilitate cloning into the pβG vector: 5′-AACTCTACTAGTGAATTTTTAAAACCCGAAGTCAAGAGCTCTAGATAGTA-3′. The construct, pβG-PKCβII38, was verified by restriction mapping. As a control, the analogous carboxyl-terminal region of PKCδ (C4-V5/δ) was digested using BstXI and XbaI (450 bp), purified, and ligated into the multicloning region of the βG vector. The construct, pβG-PKCδ, was verified by restriction mapping. The 404-bp PKCβII product corresponding to the 216-bp βII exon and flanking regions described above was obtained by PCR amplification using sense primer to the upstream PKCβ common C4 domain (5′-CGTATATGCGGCCGCGTTGTGGGCCTGAAGGGG-3′) and antisense primer to βI exon (5′-GCATTCTAGTCGACAAGAGTTTGTCAGTGGGAG-3′) such that the exon-included PKCβII mRNA was amplified. This PKCβII cDNA piece was cloned into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen) such that transcripts could be generated from the upstream T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The RNA probes were generated by consecutive restriction digestion of the pCR-Blunt-PKCβII vector. Riboprobe A (RpA) was the full-length PKCβII insert described above, linearized with BamHI; riboprobe B (RpB) was the PKCβII insert linearized at 175 bp withBglII within the PKCβII exon such that the PKCβI-specific exon was eliminated; riboprobe C (RpC) was linearized at 137 bp with HpaI, which cut within the PKCβII-specific exon; riboprobe D (RpD) was linearized at 102 bp with SspI, which cut within the PKCβII-specific exon. After digestion, the riboprobes were purified and their sizes and linearity were confirmed following size fractionation on agarose gels. One μg of each linearized plasmid DNA was further used for in vitrotranscription with the Ampliscribe kit (Epicentre) for competitor unlabeled probes or with Riboscribe kit (Epicentre) for transcribing labeled RNA probes using T7 RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of nucleotides, RNase inhibitor, and buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nonspecific unlabeled probes were from analogous fragments of PKCδ (described above), PKCβI (15Correa-Rotter R. Mariash C.M. Rosenberg M.E. Biotechnique. 1992; 12: 154-158PubMed Google Scholar), and β-actin, and were prepared in a similar manner. For labeled RNA probes, 5 μl of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was used in the reaction and 1 μl of RNase-free DNase I was then added and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to remove the template DNA. The transcripts were precipitated using 5 m ammonium acetate and incubated for 15 min on ice followed by a 70% ethanol wash. The pellet was resuspended in RNase-free water. The integrity of RNA probes was confirmed and probes were purified by 6% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In brief, A10 cells incubated in 5.5 mm glucose (low) or 25 mm glucose (high glucose) for 4 h were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, gently scraped, collected, and centrifuged at 1850 × g for 10 min. The packed cells were re-suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μmantipain), allowed to swell for 10 min on ice, and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with 60 strokes using type B pestle. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifuging at 3300 × g for 15 min, and the cytoplasmic extract was mixed with 0.11 volume of cytoplasmic buffer (0.3 m HEPES, pH 7.9 at 4 °C, 1.4 mKCl, 0.03 m MgCl2). After centrifugation for 1 h in a Beckman type 50 rotor at 40,000 rpm, the supernatant (S100) was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. An aliquot was used to determine the protein concentrations using the Bradford protein assay (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). S100 extracts from A10 cells exposed to low (5.5 mm) glucose and high (25 mm) glucose concentrations containing 3 μg of protein were incubated with 3 μg of yeast tRNA and 10 units of RNase inhibitor in a final volume of 10 μl of RNA shift buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2) for 10 min at room temperature. 100–300-Fold excess specific cold competitors or 100-fold excess nonspecific cold competitors quantified spectrophotometrically using a Pharmacia Gene Quant were added to the binding reactions and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Labeled RNA probes RpA, RpB, RpC, or RpD (described above) to an activity of ∼1 × 106 cpm were added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. RNase T1 was added to the binding reaction to digest the unbound RNA. Because the cytoplasmic extracts may contain proteins that bind to negatively charged polyanions, like nucleic acids, heparin was added to the reaction to suppress nonspecific binding (19Cheng S.C. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1014-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 20Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). 100 Units of RNase T1 was added and further incubated for 15 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 5 mg/ml heparin to reduce nonspecific binding, for 10 min on ice. Samples were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImaging screen. RNA-protein binding reactions were carried out as described above for the RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay. To demonstrate specificity, the 38-nucleotide sequence (50 nm) described above, or 50 nm of a 20-nucleotide antisense 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl (MOE) oligonucleotide (AS 25647) targeting a portion of the 38-nucleotide region, 5′-CTTGACTTCGGGTTTTAAAA-3′, were added to binding reactions. As a control, another 20-nucleotide antisense MOE oligonucleotide (AS 25649), 5′-GAAGTTGGAGGTGTCTCGCT-3′, upstream of this region or a scrambled 20-mer MOE oligonucleotide was used. Following heparin addition, the samples were transferred to a 96-well plate, and irradiated for 10 min in Stratalinker (Stratagene) on ice. Laemmli's buffer was added to the sample, which was then boiled for 5 min and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImaging screens. To control for nonspecific protein/RNA interactions, 1 μg of micrococcal nuclease (Sigma) was added to control and glucose-treated cell extracts with 70 mm EDTA in addition to the labeled probe. There was no difference in the UV cross-linking in the presence of micrococcal nuclease to either control or high glucose-treated cytosolic extracts. Previous experiments had suggested that insertion of the 3′-PKCβII exon via alternative splicing introduced a glucose-responsive instability region that was not present in the PKCβI mRNA (2Patel N.A. Chalfant C.E. Yamamoto M. Watson J.E. Eichler D.C. Cooper D.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test this, a corresponding region consisting of 70 nucleotides in the last domain common to both PKCβI and PKCβII (C4), the PKCβII-specific exon (V5) (216 nucleotides), and 119 nucleotides of the flanking βI exon were recloned into an expression vector (pβG) to form a vector expressing β-globin-PKCβII mRNA (see Fig. 2,a and b). The resulting chimeric vector, pβG-PKCβII was under the regulation of a viral promoter and contained a polyadenylation sequence, eliminating regulatory effects on transcription and nuclear decay. The pβG-PKCβII vector was transiently transfected into A10 cells, a rat clonal vascular smooth muscle cell line, and also into human aorta smooth muscle cells. Aorta smooth muscle cells respond to glucose-induced destabilization of PKCβII mRNA in an analogous manner to A10 cells and provide a primary cell model for corroborating glucose effects in human cells (2Patel N.A. Chalfant C.E. Yamamoto M. Watson J.E. Eichler D.C. Cooper D.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As demonstrated by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2 c), acute exposure (2 h) to high glucose (25 mm) resulted in a decrease (>80%) in the chimeric β-globin-PKCβII mRNA, when compared with the same cells exposed to control levels of low glucose (5.5 mm). In A10 cells transfected with the parent vector, pβG, β-globin mRNA levels remained unaltered after exposure to high glucose concentrations. Levels of β-actin mRNA remained unchanged in low glucose and high glucose-treated pβG-PKCβII and pβG-transfected cells. To further rule out the possibility of nonspecific effects caused by inserting the fragment of PKCβII cDNA into the pβG vector, an analogous fragment corresponding to the exon for the COOH-terminal domain of PKCδ (C4-V5/δ) was subcloned into the parent pβG vector creating a chimeric reporter expressing β-globin-PKCδ mRNA (Fig. 3 a). This chimeric plasmid was transiently transfected into A10 cells. As shown by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3 b), exposure of cells to high glucose had no effect on the stability of β-globin-PKCδ mRNA. Half-life determinations of β-globin-PKCβII mRNA were carried out in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor, DRB. DRB was used rather than actinomycin D, because actinomycin D, commonly used to inhibit RNA polymerase II, has also been reported to inhibit translation (21Shetty S. Kumar A. Idell S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and in some instances to also inhibit mRNA degradation (22Kostura M. Craig N. Biochem. J. 1986; 25: 6384-6391Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Steinberg R.A. Levinson B.B. Tomkins G.M. Cell. 1975; 5: 29-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Stable A10 cell transfectants of pβG-PKCβII or pβG were pretreated with DRB, and then incubated with low (5.5 mm) or high (25 mm) glucose for various times up to 6 h. Northern blot analysis of total RNA showed that only 20% of the β-globin-PKCβII mRNA remained after exposure to high (25 mm) glucose concentrations, compared with β-globin-PKCβII mRNA in the presence of control (5.5 mm) glucose concentrations within 2 h (Fig. 4). This is in agreement with the results presented in Fig. 2. High glucose concentrations reduced the half-life of the β-globin-PKCβII mRNA to 45 min, effectively decreasing the amount of the mRNA. Inclusion of the PKCβII-specific exon in many cell types results in mature PKCβII mRNA in which PKCβI exon functions as an extended 3′-UTR (Fig. 1). Exon inclusion produces new C4-βII and βII-βI exon junctions in the PKCβII mRNA. Hence, to examine the influence of glucose on mRNA stability that may be mediated by insertion of the βII exon, a new construct without the 3′-βI exon was examined. The β-globin-PKCβIIΔβI vector was transiently transfected into A10 cells, and cells were exposed to high or low glucose (control). As shown (Fig. 5), high glucose also destabilized the β-globin-PKCβIIΔβI mRNA. The extent of destabilization was less than that observed for the β-globin-PKCβII chimeric mRNA shown in Fig. 2 c. Approximately 50% of the β-globin-PKCβIIΔβI mRNA was degraded compared with >80% degradation of the β-globin-PKCβII chimeric mRNA in cells treated with high glucose. These results suggested that inclusion of the βII exon was necessary to confer full glucose-sensitive mRNA degradation, but the C4-βII exon junction alone was not sufficient to produce the same level of glucose-induced destabilization as observed for the complete 3′ PKCβII mRNA sequence, including both the C4-βII and βII-βI exon junctions as shown in Fig. 2 c. Initial studies demonstrated that a nuclease activity present in the cytosolic extracts from glucose-treated cells mediated PKCβII mRNA destabilization (2Patel N.A. Chalfant C.E. Yamamoto M. Watson J.E. Eichler D.C. Cooper D.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To further investigate regions important for destabilization within the PKCβII exon, cytoplasmic extracts from A10 cells were examined for transacting components that specifically interact with a glucose-sensitive element within the βII exon using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. As shown in Fig. 6 a, only the extract from A10 cells exposed to high glucose retained the labeled probe, suggesting a large protein-RNA complex was forming in these extracts. No complex formation was observed with the control (5.5 mm glucose) cytoplasmic extracts. To further demonstrate spec"

Sequence analysis revealed the presence within exon v10 of two motifs that may be relevant to this interaction, a B[X 7]B motif that may contribute to the recognition and binding of chondroitin sulfate and a serine-glycine motif that may serve as a site of chondroitin sulfate attachment. To determine whether either of these two motifs explain the unique adhesive activity of exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms, each was targeted by site-directed mutagenesis, and the adhesive activity of the resultant mutants was determined using a quantitative cell-cell binding assay.

Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in the case of colorectal carcinoma, patients with Duke's C and D tumors that express high levels of CD44R1, a CD44 isoform that contains sequences encoded by the alternatively spliced exons v8, v9, and v10, exhibit a far worse 5-year disease-free survival rate than equivalent patients with tumors that express predominantly CD44H, an isoform that lacks these differentially utilized exons (2Finn L. Dougherty G. Finley G. Meisler A. Becich M. Cooper D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Weg-Remers S. Schuder G. Zeitz M. Stallmach A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 859: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for a wide range of other hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic malignancies (1Naot D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv.

Recent studies from our group and others have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie this important relationship. Thus, although CD44H and the exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms CD44R1 and CD44R2 appear equivalent in their ability to bind the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA)1 (5Dougherty G.J. Cooper D.L. Memory J.F. Chiu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9074-9078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms possess the unique ability to directly bind to one another when expressed on the cell surface (5Dougherty G.J. Cooper D.L. Memory J.F. Chiu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9074-9078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The novel adhesive phenotype conferred by the inclusion of sequences encoded by exon v10 appeared not to be dependent upon the presence of HA but instead involved the recognition of chondroitin sulfate (CS) moieties presented in association with other CD44 molecules (6Chiu R.K. Droll A. Dougherty S.T. Carpenito C. Cooper D.L. Dougherty G.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This finding is in agreement with previous studies showing that CD44 can bind a variety of CS-modified protein ligands, including serglycin (7Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamura F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35448-35456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).The precise molecular nature of the CS-dependent interaction that occurs between exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms remains to be determined. Exon v10 encodes an additional B[X 7]B motif that in CD44 and other proteins has been shown to play a pivotal role in mediating the binding of HA and CS (11Yang B. Zhang L. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8617-8623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although this conclusion has not been borne out in all studies (12Bajorath J. Greenfield B. Munro S.B. Day A.J. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 338-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Day A.J. Prestwich G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The inclusion of an additional B[X 7]B motif in v10-containing CD44 isoforms could potentially enhance the avidity of the CD44 molecule for CS allowing homotypic adhesion between v10-containing CD44 isoforms to occur. Exon v10 also encodes a serine-glycine motif that could be differentially modified by the attachment of CS in certain cell types. Conceivably, CS moieties attached at this site may be preferentially recognized by other CD44 molecules thereby promoting cell-cell adhesion. To differentiate between these two possibilities, site-directed mutagenesis was used to abrogate each of the two functionally important motifs encoded by exon v10, and the effect on cellular adhesion was determined. The results obtained demonstrate clearly that it is the additional B[X 7]B motif encoded by exon v10 that is responsible for the enhanced cellular adhesion mediated by exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms. These data provide an explanation for the observed relationship between expression of exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms and enhanced metastatic propensity.RESULTSExamination of the sequence of CD44 exon v10 revealed two motifs that could potentially contribute to the unique CS-dependent adhesive interaction that occurs between v10-containing alternatively spliced CD44 isoforms. The first is B[X 7]B, a motif that has been implicated in the HA and CS binding ability of a wide range of cell surface proteins, including CD44 itself. The second is a serine-glycine dipeptide generated at the junction of exon v10 and the “constant” exon 16 that could potentially serve as a site of CS attachment. As shown in Fig. 1, a PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to inactivate each of these sites, and the ability of the mutated proteins to facilitate enhanced cell-cell adhesion was determined. Specifically, the first basic residue in the exon v10-encoded B[X 7]B motif (arginine 288) was converted to serine generating a mutant cDNA designated CD44R1.R288S. The putative serine-glycine CS attachment site was similarly inactivated by converting the glycine residue at position 355 to an alanine generating a mutant designated CD44R1.G355A.To compare their functional activity, the wild-type and mutant CD44R1 cDNAs were cloned into the episomal expression vector pCDM8 and introduced into COS7 cells by electroporation. As shown in Fig. 2, Western blot analysis indicated that both the CD44R1.R288S and CD44R1.G355A mutants were expressed by transfected COS7 cells and that the protein products are identical in size to CD44R1. As expected, COS7 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding CD44H or the exon v10-containing isoform CD44R2 produced smaller protein products with molecular masses of ∼90 and 115 kDa, respectively.The CD44R1 mutants were next tested for their ability to bind soluble HA. COS7 cells transfected with CD44H, CD44R2, and wild-type or mutant CD44R1 cDNAs were harvested 72 h post-electroporation, and CD44 expression and HA binding activities were determined by flow cytometry. Representative dot plots for each transfectant are shown in Fig. 3. On average ∼15–20% of COS7 cells transiently transfected with each of the pCDM8-based CD44 constructs expressed CD44 proteins on the cell surface as determined by reactivity with the PE-conjugated anti-CD44 mAb G44–26. Importantly, the levels of expression were similar for all the CD44 constructs tested, including the two exon v10 mutants (CD44R1.R288S and CD44R1.G355A). Double labeling with anti-CD44-PE and FITC-HA indicated that only the subset of transfected COS7 cells that express CD44 are able to bind HA and that CD44H, CD44R1, and CD44R2 appear similar in this regard. Moreover, it is evident that the mutations introduced into the CD44R1.R288S and CD44R1.G355A constructs do not adversely affect the ability of the CD44 proteins produced to bind HA.Figure 3CD44 expression and HA-binding efficiency of COS7 cell transfectants. COS7 cells were electroporated with each of the various wild-type or mutant CD44 constructs in the expression vector pCDM8. Cells were harvested 72 h after electroporation and incubated with a PE-conjugated anti-CD44 antibody and FITC-conjugated HA for ∼1 h at 4 °C. Following extensive washing the labeled cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur for CD44 expression (FL2) and FITC-HA binding (FL1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of the various wild-type and mutant CD44 proteins to mediate CS-dependent cell-cell adhesion was also determined using a quantitative cell binding assay. As shown in Fig. 4, control CD44-negative TILJneo cells lack the ability to bind to COS7 cells transfected with any of the CD44 constructs tested. In contrast, a low level of binding is evident between CD44H-expressing TIL1 cells (TILJhCD44H) and COS7 cells transfected with CD44H. Significantly enhanced binding is observed between TILJhCD44H cells and COS7 cells expressing the CD44R1 isoform. A similar increased level of binding to COS7 cells expressing CD44R2 is also observed suggesting that the enhanced adhesion seen for CD44R1 can be attributed solely to the presence within this molecule of sequences encoded by exon v10, because only this additional exon is present in CD44R2. Mutation of the serine-glycine motif in CD44R1 (CD44R1.G355A) did not impact on the cell-cell binding ability of the molecule. In contrast, mutation of the B[X 7]B motif abrogated the enhanced adhesive function mediated by the presence of exon v10 reducing cell binding to the level obtained for CD44H.Figure 4Analysis of exon v10-encoded motifs on CD44-mediated cell-cell binding. COS7 cells electroporated with the indicated CD44 constructs in the expression vector pCDM8 were harvested after 48 h, and 2 × 104 transfected cells allowed to adhere overnight onto glass coverslips in the wells of a 24-well plate. Culture media was removed and 5 × 105 control TIL1 cells (TILJNeo), or TIL1 cells expressing CD44H (TILJhCD44H), or CD44R1 (TILJhCD44R1) in 0.5 ml of PBS were added and allowed to bind for 15 min at 4 °C. Unbound TIL1 were removed by gentle washing, and the coverslips were fixed and stained for CD44 expression using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. The percentage of CD44-positive COS7 cells binding three or more TIL1 cells was determined by counting on an inverted-phase microscope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)High level reciprocal binding is observed for the interaction between TILJhCD44R1 and COS7 cells transfected with CD44R1 (Fig. 4). Once again, CD44R2, which contains additional sequences encoded only by exon v10, had a binding activity similar to CD44R1. As before, although mutation of the exon v10-encoded serine-glycine motif had no effect on the enhanced adhesive ability of the CD44R1 molecule, mutation of the B[X 7]B motif reduced the binding obtained to a level similar to that seen for CD44H.As shown in Fig. 5, treatment with chondroitinase ABC also reduced the binding of TILJhCD44R1 to COS cells expressing CD44R1 or CD44R1.G355A to a level similar to that obtained for CD44H. Hyaluronidase treatment had no such effect. Importantly, the adhesive interaction between chondroitinase-treated TILJCD44R1 cells and the various wild-type and mutant CD44R1 molecules could be reconstituted by the addition of HA, which functions as a linker or bridge between the CD44 molecules present on the surface of the interacting cells. These data confirm that chondroitinase treatment affected only the presentation of CS by CD44R1 and not the ligand binding function of molecule. Finally, as expected, the low level binding of TILJhCD44R1 cells to COS cells expressing CD44R1.R288S was not further reduced by chondroitinase ABC treatment, strongly suggesting that it is the recognition of CS, mediated by the presence within exon v10 of an additional B[X 7]B motif, that is primarily responsible for the reciprocal adhesive interaction between exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms.Figure 5Involvement of CS in the adhesive interaction between wild-type CD44 and exon v10 site-directed CD44 mutants.2 × 104 COS7 cells harvested 48 h after transfection with pCDM8.CD44H, pCDM8.CD44R1, or the exon v10 site-directed CD44 mutants pCDM8.CD44R1.G355A or pCDM8.CD44R1.R288S were allowed to adhere overnight onto glass coverslips in the wells of a 24-well plate. Next day, HA was added to some wells at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the plates were incubated for a further 1 h at 0 °C. Supernatants were then removed, and 5 × 105 untreated TILJhCD44R1 cells or equivalent numbers of cells that had been treated with chondroitinase ABC (5 units/ml) (C'ase) or hyaluronidase (20 units/ml) (H'ase) for 1 h at 37 °C, were added in a final volume of 0.5 ml of PBS and allowed to bind for 15 min at 4 °C. Unbound TIL1 cells were removed by gentle washing, and the coverslips were fixed and stained for CD44 expression using an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. The percentage of CD44-positive COS7 cells binding three or more TIL1 cells was determined by counting on an inverted-phase microscope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONAlthough previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between the expression of certain exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms and enhanced tumor metastasis and/or poor prognosis (1Naot D.

Pathol. 1997; 50: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms that underlie this important relationship have yet to be elucidated. Some initial experiments suggested that CD44H and CD44R1 may differ in their ability to bind the extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan HA (19Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Amiot M. Seed B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 20Sy M.S. Guo Y.J. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, this finding has not been borne out in all studies (5Dougherty G.J. Cooper D.L. Memory J.F. Chiu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9074-9078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21He Q.

In this and previous studies we have shown that CD44H, CD44R1 (v8–10-containing), and CD44R2 (v10-containing) are all equivalent in their HA-binding function when expressed in either TIL1 cells or COS7 cells (5Dougherty G.J.

Cell Res. 1999; 248: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, unlike CD44H, the exon v8–10-containing isoform CD44R1 was capable of promoting cell-cell adhesion (6Chiu R.K.

Because CD44R2 has a similar activity, it was concluded that this unique function was conferred by the presence of sequences encoded by exon v10 (6Chiu R.K. Droll A. Dougherty S.T. Carpenito C. Cooper D.L. Dougherty G.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, the sensitivity of the binding process to chondroitinase indicated that CD44 exon v10-mediated cell-cell adhesion involved the recognition of CS side chains (6Chiu R.K. Droll A.

Because COS7 cells transfected with CD44R1 or CD44R2 do not bind control TILJneo cells but only TIL1 cells transfected with CD44H or CD44R1, it must be assumed that the CS-modified proteoglycan recognized and bound by the exon v10-containing isoforms must be CD44 itself (6Chiu R.K. Droll A. Dougherty S.T. Carpenito C. Cooper D.L. Dougherty G.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,15Droll A. Dougherty S.T. Chiu R.K. Dirks J.F. McBride W.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11567-11573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).An examination of the sequence encoded by CD44 exon v10 revealed two sites that could potentially contribute to the enhanced cellular adhesion mediated by v10-containing CD44 isoforms, namely a B[X 7]B motif that has been suggested to function as a HA/CS binding site (11Yang B. Zhang L. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8617-8623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a serine-glycine motif that could potentially serve as a site of CS attachment (25Mann D.M. Yamaguchi Y. Bourdon M.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis it was shown conclusively in the present study that it is the B[X 7]B motif encoded by exon v10 that confers the unique adhesive phenotype on cells expressing exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms. When this motif is mutated, as is the case in the CD44R1.R288S construct, the CD44R1 molecule now exhibits an adhesive activity similar to CD44H, which of course completely lacks v10-encoded sequences. This result can perhaps be best explained if CD44 exon v10-containing isoforms interact with one another in reciprocal fashion. When two interacting cells both express exon v10-containing CD44 molecules, the B[X 7]B motifs in both proteins recognize and bind CS side chains covalently attached to the CD44 molecules present on the opposing cell surface promoting a high level of cellular adhesion. Conversely, if only one cell expresses exon v10-containing CD44 molecules, the interaction would be non-reciprocal in nature and a lower level of binding is expected to occur. This is exactly what is seen in the interaction between CD44R1- and CD44H-expressing cell types or when the B[X 7]B motif is mutated in one of the interacting CD44R1 proteins.CD44H already contains two B[X 7]B motifs encoded, respectively, by exon 2 and exon 5 (26Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). This raises the question as to why inclusion of an additional motif in sequences encoded by exon v10 has such a profound effect on the adhesive activity of the CD44 molecule. The three B[X 7]B motifs are, of course, not identical and may differ from one another with respect to their affinity for CS. It has already been demonstrated, for example, that the inclusion of acidic amino acid residues within the motif reduces its ability to bind HA, whereas the presence of additional basic residues enhances the affinity of this interaction (11Yang B. Zhang L. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8617-8623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is possible that the positioning of the exon v10-encoded motif may, as a result of spatial considerations, favor interaction with CS moieties attached to CD44 proteins on the surface of interacting cells. Alternatively, the presence of an additional B[X 7]B motif may simply increase the avidity of the CD44 molecule for CS raising the level above the threshold necessary for CS binding. It is noteworthy in this regard that the binding of HA by CD44 is of low affinity and that a certain cell-specific level of CD44 expression is necessary before HA binding can occur. 2R. K. Chiu, A. Droll, S. T. Dougherty, and G. J. Dougherty, manuscript in preparation. A non-mutually exclusive possibility that incorporates both the preceding arguments could be that the exon v10-encoded B[X 7]B motif may cross-link CD44 proteins in the plane of the membrane through recognition of CS, inducing receptor aggregation thereby enhancing avidity and promoting the recognition and binding of CD44 on the surface of interacting cells. Studies to differentiate between these various alternatives are currently under way.There are four serine-glycine sites within CD44H that could potentially be modified by attachment of CS (27Goldstein L.A. Zhou D.F. Picker L.J. Minty C.N. Bargatze R.F. Ding J.F. Butcher E.C. Cell. 1989; 56: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 28Stamenkovic I. Amiot M. Pesando J.M. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 56: 1057-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Although an additional serine-glycine motif is generated at the junction of exon v10 and exon 16 in CD44R1 and CD44R2 (16Dougherty G.J. Landorp P.M. Cooper D.L. Humphries R.K. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), inactivation of this site by site-directed mutagenesis had no appreciable effect on the ability of v10-containing CD44 isoforms to promote enhanced cell-cell adhesion. Thus, although recognition of CS plays a critical role in the adhesive interactions mediated by the presence of CD44 exon v10 (6Chiu R.K. Droll A. Dougherty S.T. Carpenito C. Cooper D.L. Dougherty G.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Droll A. Dougherty S.T. Chiu R.K. Dirks J.F. McBride W.H. Cooper D.L. Dougherty G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11567-11573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the actual site at which the glycosaminoglycan side chains are attached remains to be determined.The enhanced ability of exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms to promote cell-cell adhesion may explain the observed correlation between expression of such isoforms on tumor cells and metastatic propensity and/or poor patient prognosis. The presence of exon v10-encoded sequences may promote the formation of tumor cell microemboli that survive better in the circulation and trap more readily in capillary beds. The expression of alternatively spliced CD44 isoforms may also promote the adhesion of tumor cells to vascular endothelial cells in target organs, whereas adhesive interactions between CD44 isoforms may transduce signals that protect tumor cells from various naturally occurring or therapeutically induced pro-apoptotic stimuli. Numerous studies have documented a striking correlation between the presence of certain alternatively spliced isoforms of the adhesion protein CD44 on the surface of tumor cells and both metastatic propensity and poor prognosis (1Naot D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in the case of colorectal carcinoma, patients with Duke's C and D tumors that express high levels of CD44R1, a CD44 isoform that contains sequences encoded by the alternatively spliced exons v8, v9, and v10, exhibit a far worse 5-year disease-free survival rate than equivalent patients with tumors that express predominantly CD44H, an isoform that lacks these differentially utilized exons (2Finn L. Dougherty G. Finley G. Meisler A. Becich M. Cooper D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Weg-Remers S. Schuder G. Zeitz M. Stallmach A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 859: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for a wide range of other hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic malignancies (1Naot D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rudzki Z. Jothy S. Mol. Pathol. 1997; 50: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recent studies from our group and others have provided insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie this important relationship. Thus, although CD44H and the exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms CD44R1 and CD44R2 appear equivalent in their ability to bind the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA)1 (5Dougherty G.J. Cooper D.L. Memory J.F. Chiu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9074-9078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms possess the unique ability to directly bind to one another when expressed on the cell surface (5Dougherty G.J. Cooper D.L. Memory J.F. Chiu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9074-9078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The novel adhesive phenotype conferred by the inclusion of sequences encoded by exon v10 appeared not to be dependent upon the presence of HA but instead involved the recognition of chondroitin sulfate (CS) moieties presented in association with other CD44 molecules (6Chiu R.K. Droll A. Dougherty S.T. Carpenito C. Cooper D.L. Dougherty G.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This finding is in agreement with previous studies showing that CD44 can bind a variety of CS-modified protein ligands, including serglycin (7Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamura F.

Anderson M.S. Peterson M. Miller J. Cell. 1993; 74: 257-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), aggrecan (9Fujimoto T. Kawashima H. Tanaka T. Hirose M. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Matsuzawa Y. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and versican (10Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35448-35456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The precise molecular nature of the CS-dependent interaction that occurs between exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms remains to be determined. Exon v10 encodes an additional B[X 7]B motif that in CD44 and other proteins has been shown to play a pivotal role in mediating the binding of HA and CS (11Yang B. Zhang L. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8617-"
