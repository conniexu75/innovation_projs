https://openalex.org/W3207912190,"Abstract A major goal in human genetics is to use natural variation to understand the phenotypic consequences of altering each protein-coding gene in the genome. Here we used exome sequencing 1 to explore protein-altering variants and their consequences in 454,787 participants in the UK Biobank study 2 . We identified 12 million coding variants, including around 1 million loss-of-function and around 1.8 million deleterious missense variants. When these were tested for association with 3,994 health-related traits, we found 564 genes with trait associations at P ≤ 2.18 × 10 −11 . Rare variant associations were enriched in loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but most (91%) were independent of common variant signals. We discovered several risk-increasing associations with traits related to liver disease, eye disease and cancer, among others, as well as risk-lowering associations for hypertension ( SLC9A3R2 ), diabetes ( MAP3K15 , FAM234A ) and asthma ( SLC27A3 ). Six genes were associated with brain imaging phenotypes, including two involved in neural development ( GBE1 , PLD1 ). Of the signals available and powered for replication in an independent cohort, 81% were confirmed; furthermore, association signals were generally consistent across individuals of European, Asian and African ancestry. We illustrate the ability of exome sequencing to identify gene–trait associations, elucidate gene function and pinpoint effector genes that underlie GWAS signals at scale."

The ability to manipulate the genome in a programmable manner has illuminated biology and shown promise in the clinical treatment of genetic diseases. Toward the goal of enabling a wide range of sequence changes, we developed prime editing, a versatile gene editing approach that can install all types of targeted DNA base pair substitutions, small insertions, small deletions, and combinations thereof without requiring double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) or donor DNA templates (Anzalone et al., 2020Anzalone A.V.

Despite its versatility, the efficiency of prime editing can vary widely across edit classes, target loci, and cell types (Anzalone et al., 2019Anzalone A.V. Randolph P.B. Davis J.R. Sousa A.A. Koblan L.W. Levy J.M. Chen P.J. Wilson C. Newby G.A. Raguram A. Liu D.R. Search-and-replace genome editing without double-strand breaks or donor DNA.Nature. 2019; 576: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). To maximize the utility of prime editing, we sought to identify cellular determinants of prime editing outcomes and use the resulting insights to develop improved prime editing systems. Prime editing minimally requires two components: an engineered reverse transcriptase (RT) fused to Cas9 nickase (the PE2 protein) and a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that contains both a spacer sequence complementary to target DNA and a 3′ extension encoding the desired edit (Anzalone et al., 2019Anzalone A.V. Randolph P.B. Davis J.R. Sousa A.A. Koblan L.W. Levy J.M. Chen P.J. Wilson C. Newby G.A. Raguram A. Liu D.R. Search-and-replace genome editing without double-strand breaks or donor DNA.Nature. 2019; 576: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). The PE2–pegRNA complex binds one strand of a target DNA locus and nicks the opposite strand, exposing a DNA 3′ end that can hybridize to the primer binding site (PBS) in the pegRNA extension. Reverse transcription of the RT template within the pegRNA extension then generates a 3′ DNA flap that contains the edited sequence and ultimately leads to incorporation of that sequence into the genome. The “PE3” system differs from PE2 by using an additional single guide RNA (sgRNA) to nick the non-edited strand at a location away from the pegRNA target, which enhances editing efficiency. However, nicking the non-edited strand also increases the frequency of undesired insertions and deletions (indels) at the target site. In vitro experiments provide support for the early steps of prime editing (Anzalone et al., 2019Anzalone A.V. Randolph P.B. Davis J.R. Sousa A.A. Koblan L.W. Levy J.M. Chen P.J. Wilson C. Newby G.A. Raguram A. Liu D.R. Search-and-replace genome editing without double-strand breaks or donor DNA.Nature. 2019; 576: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), but mechanisms downstream of 3′ flap synthesis remain speculative. According to the current model, the newly synthesized 3′ flap displaces an adjacent strand of genomic DNA through flap interconversion (Figure S1A). Excision of the displaced 5′ flap then allows ligation of the edited sequence into the genome. Nicking the non-edited strand in the PE3 system is thought to induce cellular replacement of the non-edited strand and thus promote installation of the edited sequence in both strands. The presumed involvement of cellular factors in these steps motivated us to study the roles of DNA repair mechanisms in prime editing and to develop improved prime editing systems through manipulation of those processes. Here, we used pooled CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-based screens to systematically probe the effect of 476 genes involved in DNA repair and associated processes on substitution prime editing outcomes. We discovered that specific DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes strongly suppress prime editing efficiency and promote indel formation. Consistent with a model in which MMR reverts heteroduplex DNA formed during prime editing, we identified classes of prime edits that are less vulnerable to MMR activity and are therefore generated more efficiently. Integrating these findings, we developed improved prime editing systems through transient expression of a dominant negative MMR protein (MLH1dn). In six MMR-proficient cell types, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and primary T cells, these PE4 (PE2+MLH1dn) and PE5 (PE3+MLH1dn) systems enhanced editing efficiency over PE2 and PE3 by an average of 7.7-fold and 2.0-fold, respectively, and increased edit/indel ratios (outcome purity) by 3.4-fold. Transient co-expression of MLH1dn did not result in detected changes to microsatellite repeat length, a clinical biomarker of MMR proficiency (Umar et al., 2004Umar A. Boland C.R. Terdiman J.P. Syngal S. de la Chapelle A. Rüschoff J. Fishel R. Lindor N.M. Burgart L.J. Hamelin R. et al.Revised Bethesda Guidelines for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome) and microsatellite instability.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). Strategic installation of additional silent mutations nearby an intended edit can also improve prime editing efficiency by evading MMR recognition, even in the absence of MLH1dn. Finally, we engineered an optimized “PEmax” prime editor architecture that further increased editing efficiency in synergy with PE4, PE5, and engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs) (Nelson et al., 2021Nelson J.W. Randolph P.B. Shen S.P. Everette K.A. Chen P.J. Anzalone A.V. Newby G.A. An M. Chen J.C. Hsu A. Liu D.R. Engineered pegRNAs improve prime editing efficiency.Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01039-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These findings deepen our understanding of prime editing and establish prime editing systems with substantially improved efficiency and outcome purity across 191 different edits at 20 loci in seven mammalian cell types. We reasoned that identifying genetic determinants of prime editing sequence outcomes, including the original sequence, the desired edit, and indels, could inform strategies to maximize efficiency and minimize unwanted byproducts. We therefore used a genetic screening approach to study prime editing. This method, called Repair-seq, measures the effects of many loss-of-function perturbations on the outcomes of genome editing experiments by linking the identity of CRISPRi sgRNAs to edited sites in pooled screens (Hussmann et al., 2021Hussmann J.A. Ling J. Ravisankar P. Yan J. Cirincione A. Xu A. Simpson D. Yang D. Bothmer A. Cotta-Ramusino C. Weissman J.S. Adamson B. Mapping the genetic landscape of DNA double-strand break repair.Cell. 2021; Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). Briefly, a library of sgRNAs are transduced into cells expressing the CRISPRi effector (dCas9–KRAB) such that most cells receive only one sgRNA, causing the knockdown of one gene per cell. After genome editing occurs at an adjacent target site delivered on the same lentiviral cassette, paired-end sequencing enables the frequency of each editing outcome to be measured for each linked CRISPRi perturbation. To enable Repair-seq screens for prime editing outcomes, we first made prime editing and CRISPRi orthogonal. Typically, these systems both rely on Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). We constructed an SaPE2 prime editor variant by replacing the SpCas9 nickase domain in PE2 with Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) N580A nickase (Ran et al., 2015Ran F.A. Cong L. Yan W.X. Scott D.A. Gootenberg J.S. Kriz A.J. Zetsche B. Shalem O. Wu X. Makarova K.S. et al.In vivo genome editing using Staphylococcus aureus Cas9.Nature. 2015; 520: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) and verified SaPE2 editing activity with orthogonal S. aureus pegRNAs (Sa-pegRNAs) (Figure S1B). Next, we built a Repair-seq vector for screening with a composite SaPE2 edit site. This site comprised a target protospacer that is efficiently prime edited in HEK293T cells (Figure S1B) and two flanking protospacers that allow complementary-strand nicks 50 bp downstream (+50 nick) or upstream (−50 nick) of the target (Figures 1B and S1C). This design supports SaPE2 prime editing in three configurations: PE2, PE3 with a +50 nick (PE3+50), or PE3 with a −50 nick (PE3−50) (Figure S1D). In a validated HeLa CRISPRi cell line (Gilbert et al., 2013Gilbert L.A. Larson M.H. Morsut L. Liu Z. Brar G.A. Torres S.E. Stern-Ginossar N. Brandman O. Whitehead E.H. Doudna J.A. et al.CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes.Cell. 2013; 154: 442-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar), we observed G⋅C-to-C⋅G prime editing efficiencies up to 9.4% with PE2, 15% with PE3+50, and 3.5% with PE3−50 (Figures S1E and S1F) at this composite edit site, establishing a screening assay well suited to detect increases or decreases in editing from CRISPRi perturbations. We performed Repair-seq screens of prime editing outcomes with PE2 and PE3+50 in K562 and HeLa cells and with PE3−50 in HeLa cells. We transduced a Repair-seq library of 1,513 sgRNAs targeting 476 genes (enriched for roles in DNA repair and associated processes; Figure S1G) and 60 non-targeting control sgRNAs into human K562 and HeLa CRISPRi cell lines (Gilbert et al., 2014Gilbert L.A.

Mapping the genetic landscape of DNA double-strand break repair.Cell. 2021; Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B; Table S1). Next, we transfected these cells with SaPE2, Sa-pegRNA, and Sa-sgRNA plasmids that program a G⋅C-to-C⋅G transversion at the co-transduced edit site. Finally, we extracted genomic DNA, amplified the CRISPRi sgRNA and edit site by PCR, and performed paired-end sequencing to measure the distribution of editing outcomes for each genetic perturbation (Figure S1C). To interpret the resulting data, we compared the frequencies of editing outcomes from cells containing a gene-targeting CRISPRi sgRNA to the corresponding frequencies from cells containing non-targeting sgRNA controls. Reduction in an outcome’s frequency upon gene knockdown suggests that the gene’s activity promotes formation of the outcome, while an increase in frequency suggests that the gene’s activity suppresses the outcome. We first examined the effect of gene knockdowns on the frequency of the intended G⋅C-to-C⋅G edit. In cells with non-targeting CRISPRi sgRNAs, 4.3%–4.9% (K562) and 8.5%–8.7% (HeLa) of sequencing reads contained exactly the intended edit following PE2 editing (Figures 1C and 1D). These levels increased to 14%–16% (K562) and 14%–16% (HeLa) for PE3+50 but decreased to 2.1%–2.2% (HeLa) for PE3−50. Across all screen conditions, CRISPRi targeting of MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2, components of the MutSα–MutLα MMR complex (Iyer et al., 2006Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Burdett V. Modrich P.L.

Mechanisms and functions of DNA mismatch repair.Cell Res. 2008; 18: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), substantially increased editing efficiency by up to 5.8-fold for PE2, 2.5-fold for PE3+50, and 2.0-fold for PE3−50 (Figures 1E–1G and S1H–S1K; Table S2). Knockdown of EXO1, an exonuclease with a role in MMR (Genschel et al., 2002Genschel J. Bazemore L.R. Modrich P. Human exonuclease I is required for 5′ and 3′ mismatch repair.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13302-13311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), also increased intended PE2 editing efficiency by up to 2.3-fold. In contrast, knockdown of LIG1, a nick-sealing DNA ligase (Pascal et al., 2004Pascal J.M. O’Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T. Human DNA ligase I completely encircles and partially unwinds nicked DNA.Nature. 2004; 432: 473-478https://doi.org/10.1038/nature03082Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and of FEN1, a 5′ flap endonuclease (Liu et al., 2004Liu Y. Kao H.-I. Bambara R.A. Flap endonuclease 1: a central component of DNA metabolism.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.012803.092453Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), reduced the frequency of intended editing, consistent with their previously proposed roles in nick ligation and 5′ flap excision during prime editing (Anzalone et al., 2019Anzalone A.V.

Search-and-replace genome editing without double-strand breaks or donor DNA.Nature. 2019; 576: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that MMR activity antagonizes the installation of point mutations by prime editing. In addition to the intended edit, Repair-seq screens identified four primary categories of editing byproducts: deletions (Figure 2A), tandem duplications (Figure 2B), and two classes of outcomes containing unintended sequence from the pegRNA (Figures 2C and 2D). We observed low baseline frequencies of total unintended edits from PE2 (0.31% in K562, 0.60% in HeLa; Figure 2E) but more frequent and diverse unintended byproducts from PE3−50 (58% in HeLa; Figure S2A) and PE3+50 (8.2% in K562, 9.5% in HeLa; Figure 2F). The baseline frequencies and genetic modulators of these categories varied across PE2, PE3+50, and PE3−50 screens, providing a rich set of observations of how different prime editing configurations are processed (Figures S2A–S2I).Figure S2Genetic modulators of unintended prime editing outcomes, related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Overview of PE3–50 outcomes in HeLa CRISPRi screens.

Two of these observations informed models for the role of MMR activity during prime editing. First, one unintended outcome contained the intended G⋅C-to-C⋅G edit as well as an additional base substitution and a 1-nt insertion near the target site (Figure 2C). The sequence around these additional mutations perfectly matched 9 nt at the 3′ end of the pegRNA scaffold sequence, consistent with reverse transcription into the pegRNA scaffold and incorporation of the resulting 3′ DNA flap into partially homologous genomic sequence. Recoding the pegRNA scaffold to avoid sequence homology with the genomic target reduced the frequency of this outcome category (Figures S3A and S3B), suggesting a general approach to eliminate this class of editing byproduct. Notably, we observed that knockdown of MMR genes increased the frequency of this editing byproduct from 0.08% to 2.0% in PE2 K562 screens (Figures 2E and S2D). MMR thus suppresses the formation of this outcome to a larger extent than the intended edit, indicating that distinct prime editing intermediates can differ in the extent to which they are processed by MMR. Second, MMR knockdown reduced the frequency of most categories of unintended outcomes from PE3+50 (Figures 2F–2H, S2H, and S2I), suggesting that transiently inhibiting some MMR activities may increase both the efficiency and outcome purity of prime editing. The most abundant class of unintended PE3+50 outcomes contained sequence from the reverse-transcribed 3′ DNA flap that does not rejoin genomic sequence at the intended flap annealing location (5.1% of non-targeting reads in K562, 3.8% in HeLa; Figure 2D). In both cell types, knockdown of MMR genes reduced the frequency of unintended flap rejoining outcomes, by up to 1.7-fold (Figure 2G). Similarly, MMR knockdown substantially reduced deletions from PE3+50 by up to 3.7-fold (Figure 2H). Intriguingly, genomic sequence between the two SaPE2-induced nicks was most frequently deleted for PE3+50, but MMR knockdown in K562 cells decreased the frequency of deletions outside of these programmed nicks to a greater extent than deletions between them (Figures 2I and 2J), suggesting that MMR activity may generate longer deletion byproducts during prime editing. Finally, tandem duplications of sequence between the nicks, which were common for PE3−50 (Figure S2A) but rarer for PE3+50 (0.37% of non-targeting reads in K562, 2.3% in HeLa), were reduced by up to 3.7-fold (K562) and 1.5-fold (HeLa) by MMR knockdown (Figures 2F and S2H). The effects of MMR knockdown in these Repair-seq screens led to a working model for the role of MMR during prime editing. In eukaryotes, MMR resolves DNA heteroduplexes containing a base mismatch or small insertion-deletion loop (IDL) by selectively replacing nicked DNA strands (Iyer et al., 2006Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Burdett V. Modrich P.L. DNA mismatch repair: functions and mechanisms.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 302-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar; Kunkel and Erie, 2005Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A.

Mechanisms and functions of DNA mismatch repair.Cell Res. 2008; 18: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) (Figure S3C). To initiate MMR, the heteroduplex is first bound by MutSα (MSH2–MSH6) or MutSβ (MSH2–MSH3), which recognize base mismatches and IDLs less than 13 nt in length (Gupta et al., 2011Gupta S. Gellert M.

Next, MSH2 recruits MutLα (PMS2–MLH1), which incises the nick-containing strand around the heteroduplex (Fang and Modrich, 1993Fang W.H. Modrich P.

We hypothesized that MMR engages a specific prime editing intermediate, a DNA heteroduplex formed by hybridization of the reverse-transcribed 3′ DNA flap to adjacent genomic DNA (Figure 3A). MutSα or MutSβ may recognize the heteroduplex within this structure, and the 3′ nick present after flap equilibration, but before ligation, could stimulate selective excision of the edited strand and subsequent repair to regenerate the original, unedited sequence. Alternatively, MMR may prevent productive flap interconversion by rejecting annealing of the edited 3′ flap to the genomic target (Sugawara et al., 2004Sugawara N. Goldfarb T. Studamire B. Alani E.

https://openalex.org/W3205024267,"Abstract Recent developments in immuno-oncology demonstrate that not only cancer cells, but also the tumor microenvironment can guide precision medicine. A comprehensive and in-depth characterization of the tumor microenvironment is challenging since its cell populations are diverse and can be important even if scarce. To identify clinically relevant microenvironmental and cancer features, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to ten human lung adenocarcinomas and ten normal control tissues. Our analyses revealed heterogeneous carcinoma cell transcriptomes reflecting histological grade and oncogenic pathway activities, and two distinct microenvironmental patterns. The immune-activated CP²E microenvironment was composed of cancer-associated myofibroblasts, proinflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and exhausted CD8+ T cells, and was prognostically unfavorable. In contrast, the inert N³MC microenvironment was characterized by normal-like myofibroblasts, non-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages, NK cells, myeloid dendritic cells and conventional T cells, and was associated with a favorable prognosis. Microenvironmental marker genes and signatures identified in single-cell profiles had progonostic value in bulk tumor profiles. In summary, single-cell RNA profiling of lung adenocarcinoma provides additional prognostic information based on the microenvironment, and may help to predict therapy response and to reveal possible target cell populations for future therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3206188191,"The risk factors for breakthrough infections among healthcare workers (HCW) after completion of a full course of vaccination are poorly understood. Our objective was to determine the risk factors for breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs at a national healthcare system in Qatar.We identified all HCWs at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar between December 20, 2020 and May 18, 2021 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR infection >14 days after the second vaccine dose. For each case thus identified, we identified one control with a negative test after December 20, 2020, matched on age, sex, nationality, job family and date of SARS-CoV-2 testing. We excluded those with a prior positive test and temporary workers. We used Cox regression analysis to determine factors associated with breakthrough infection.Among 22,247 fully vaccinated HCW, we identified 164 HCW who had breakthrough infection and matched them to 164 controls to determine the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection. In the breakthrough infection group the nursing and midwifery job family constituted the largest group, spouse was identified as the most common positive contact followed by a patient. Exposure to a confirmed case, presence of symptoms and all other job families except Allied Health Professionals when compared with nursing and Midwifery staff independently predicted infection.Presence of symptoms and contact with a confirmed case are major risk factors for breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination, and these groups should be prioritized for screening even after full vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3207805315,"Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a monogenic type I interferonopathy characterized by neurodevelopmental defects and upregulation of type I interferon signaling and neuroinflammation. Mutations in genes that function in nucleic acid metabolism, including RNASEH2, are linked to AGS. Ribonuclease H2 (RNASEH2) is a genome surveillance factor critical for DNA integrity by removing ribonucleotides incorporated into replicating DNA. Here we show that RNASEH2 is necessary for neurogenesis and to avoid activation of interferon-responsive genes and neuroinflammation. Cerebellar defects after RNASEH2B inactivation are rescued by p53 but not cGAS deletion, suggesting that DNA damage signaling, not neuroinflammation, accounts for neuropathology. Coincident inactivation of Atm and Rnaseh2 further affected cerebellar development causing ataxia, which was dependent upon aberrant activation of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). The loss of ATM also markedly exacerbates cGAS-dependent type I interferon signaling. Thus, DNA damage-dependent signaling rather than type I interferon signaling underlies neurodegeneration in this class of neurodevelopmental/neuroinflammatory disease."
https://openalex.org/W3205283328,"Phosphorylation is a critical post-translational modification involved in the regulation of almost all cellular processes. However, fewer than 5% of thousands of recently discovered phosphosites have been functionally annotated. In this study, we devised a chemical genetic approach to study the functional relevance of phosphosites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We generated 474 yeast strains with mutations in specific phosphosites that were screened for fitness in 102 conditions, along with a gene deletion library. Of these phosphosites, 42% exhibited growth phenotypes, suggesting that these are more likely functional. We inferred their function based on the similarity of their growth profiles with that of gene deletions and validated a subset by thermal proteome profiling and lipidomics. A high fraction exhibited phenotypes not seen in the corresponding gene deletion, suggestive of a gain-of-function effect. For phosphosites conserved in humans, the severity of the yeast phenotypes is indicative of their human functional relevance. This high-throughput approach allows for functionally characterizing individual phosphosites at scale. Phenotypic profiling of a phospho-deficient mutant library informs functional annotations of phosphosites."
https://openalex.org/W3206797160,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) refers to the acquisition of mesenchymal properties in cells participating in tumor progression. One hallmark of EMT is the increased level of active β-catenin, which can trigger the transcription of Wnt-specific genes responsible for the control of cell fate. We investigated how Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1-Induced Protein-1 (MCPIP1), a negative regulator of inflammatory processes, affects EMT in a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell line, patient tumor tissues and a xenotransplant model. We showed that MCPIP1 degrades miRNAs via its RNase activity and thus protects the mRNA transcripts of negative regulators of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway from degradation, which in turn prevents EMT. Mechanistically, the loss of MCPIP1 RNase activity led to the upregulation of miRNA-519a-3p, miRNA-519b-3p, and miRNA-520c-3p, which inhibited the expression of Wnt pathway inhibitors (SFRP4, KREMEN1, CXXC4, CSNK1A1 and ZNFR3). Thus, the level of active nuclear β-catenin was increased, leading to increased levels of EMT inducers (SNAI1, SNAI2, ZEB1 and TWIST) and, consequently, decreased expression of E-cadherin, increased expression of mesenchymal markers, and acquisition of the mesenchymal phenotype. This study revealed that MCPIP1 may act as a tumor suppressor that prevents EMT by stabilizing Wnt inhibitors and decreasing the levels of active β-catenin and EMT inducers."
https://openalex.org/W3205802642,"Understanding the role of genes in human disease is of high importance. However, identifying genes associated with human diseases requires laborious experiments that involve considerable effort and time. Therefore, a computational approach to predict candidate genes related to complex diseases including cancer has been extensively studied. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based knowledge graph-embedding model (KGED), which is based on a biological knowledge graph with entity descriptions to infer relationships between biological entities. As an application demonstration, we generated gene-interaction networks for each cancer type using gene-gene relationships inferred by KGED. We then analyzed the constructed gene networks using network centrality measures, including betweenness, closeness, degree, and eigenvector centrality metrics, to rank the central genes of the network and identify highly correlated cancer genes. Furthermore, we evaluated our proposed approach for prostate, breast, and lung cancers by comparing the performance with that of existing approaches. The KGED model showed improved performance in predicting cancer-related genes using the inferred gene-gene interactions. Thus, we conclude that gene-gene interactions inferred by KGED can be helpful for future research, such as that aimed at future research on pathogenic mechanisms of human diseases, and contribute to the field of disease treatment discovery."
https://openalex.org/W3164498909,"A rapid stream of research confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat to mental health and psychological well-being. It is therefore important to identify both hazardous and protective individual factors during the pandemic. The current research explored the relationships between self-reported affective responding, perceived personal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and subjective well-being. An online survey (N = 471) conducted in Sweden between June and September, 2020, showed that higher levels of irritability, impulsivity, and the tendency to experience and express anger were generally associated with more severe personal consequences of the pandemic, particularly in areas related to family life, work/study, and finances. While more severe impacts of the pandemic in these areas of life were directly associated with lower subjective well-being, emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal appeared to moderate the extent to which consequences of the pandemic in other areas of life (i.e., social, free-time and physical activities) translated into decreased well-being. This suggests that cognitive reappraisal may serve to protect against some of the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Overall, the results indicate that the perceived consequences of the pandemic are multifaceted and that future research should examine these consequences using a multidimensional approach."
https://openalex.org/W3172046927,"Purpose This study aimed to analyze the association of tear matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) immunoassay with the severity of dry eye (DE) signs and symptoms through qualitative, semiquantitative, and quantitative evaluations of immunoassay band. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 320 eyes of 320 patients. The clinical signs of DE were assessed using the Ocular Surface Disorder Index (OSDI) score, visual analogue scale (VAS), tear breakup time (tBUT), tear volume evaluation by tear meniscometry, and staining scores of the cornea and conjunctiva by the Oxford grading scheme. The tear MMP-9 immunoassay results were interpreted using qualitative (positive or negative), semi-quantitative (reagent band density on a four-point scale: 0 = negative; 1 = weakly positive; 2 = moderately positive; 3 = strongly positive), and quantitative (ratio of reagent band density to control band density) indicators. Results Positive MMP-9 immunoassay results were significantly related to shorter tBUT, tBUT ≤3 seconds, higher corneal staining score, corneal staining score ≥2, and conjunctival staining score ≥2. The semi-quantitative results of the MMP-9 immunoassay were positively correlated with higher corneal staining score ( r = 0.122, p = 0.029) and negatively correlated with tBUT ( r = -0.125, p = 0.025). However, in the quantitative analysis, none of the DE signs or symptoms were correlated to the band density of the MMP-9 immunoassay. Conclusions The positive MMP-9 immunoassay results were related to the severity of ocular signs of DE. However, using quantitative measures of the MMP-9 immunoassay to assess the clinical severity of DE requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3207806556,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with the formation of renal cysts. We have devised a therapeutic approach, based on reversing the cyst phenotype from secretion to absorption by using VX-809, a modulator of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator trafficking and processing. Our goal is to test VX-809 in RC/RC mice bearing the R3277C human mutation to demonstrate its therapeutic potential. We found that by 5 months of age, RC/RC mice had large cysts and impaired renal function, but when treated with VX-809 between the ages of 3 and 5 months, or 6 and 8 months, the cyst area was reduced in both groups, suggesting that VX-809 had shrunk previously existing cysts. After 2 months of treatment, the cyst size was lower than that of untreated animals of the same age. Our co-localization studies confirmed that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is found predominately at the apical membrane in the untreated animals of each age group, consistent with its role in Cl- secretion; after VX-809 treatment, the basolateral membrane co-localization of CFTR increased ~4-fold, accompanied by a decrease of ~2-3-fold in its apical co-localization, indicating that VX-809 alters the phenotype to favor fluid absorption. Sodium/hydrogen exchanger and epithelial sodium channel, found in normal kidneys at the apical membrane, were almost absent from the cysts. VX-809 restored both levels toward normal. HSP27 is highly expressed in RC/RC mice and lowered toward normal by VX-809. Our demonstration of cyst reduction, improved renal function, and generation of an absorptive phenotype all strongly support the therapeutic potential of VX-809 as a treatment for ADPKD. We show here in an animal model of slowly progressing cyst formation typical of human ADPKD that VX-809 reduces the growth of already established cysts. The magnitude of the effect in the RC/RC mouse model when compared to previous experiments using the same mouse model to evaluate tolvaptan indicates that CFTR modulators warrant further development as a treatment for ADPKD."
https://openalex.org/W3205076188,"Mint3 is known to enhance aerobic ATP production, known as the Warburg effect, by binding to FIH-1. Since this effect is considered to be beneficial for cancer cells, the interaction is a promising target for cancer therapy. However, previous research has suggested that the interacting region of Mint3 with FIH-1 is intrinsically disordered, which makes investigation of this interaction challenging. Therefore, we adopted thermodynamic and structural studies in solution to clarify the structural and thermodynamical changes of Mint3 binding to FIH-1. First, using a combination of circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance, and hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we confirmed that the N-terminal half, which is the interacting part of Mint3, is mostly disordered. Next, we revealed a large enthalpy and entropy change in the interaction of Mint3 using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The profile is consistent with the model that the flexibility of disordered Mint3 is drastically reduced upon binding to FIH-1. Moreover, we performed a series of ITC experiments with several types of truncated Mint3s, an effective approach since the interacting part of Mint3 is disordered, and identified amino acids 78 to 88 as a novel core site for binding to FIH-1. The truncation study of Mint3 also revealed the thermodynamic contribution of each part of Mint3 to the interaction with FIH-1, where the core sites contribute to the affinity (ΔG), while other sites only affect enthalpy (ΔH), by forming noncovalent bonds. This insight can serve as a foothold for further investigation of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and drug development for cancer therapy."

Interview transcripts and notes were analysed using a thematic network analysis which included grounded theory and a framework for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms for post-TB morbidity and mortality. The analysis was iterative and the coding system developed focused on disease, treatment and post-treatment experiences of individuals. This paper follows the COREQ guidelines.For all 12 participants interviewed, the development of RR-TB disease, its diagnosis and the subsequent treatment were a major disruption to their lives as well as a transformative experience. On diagnosis of RR-TB disease, participants entered a liminal period in which their lives were marked with uncertainty and dominated by physical and mental suffering. Irrespective of how long ago they had completed their treatment, they all remembered with clarity the signs and symptoms of the disease and the arduous treatment journey. Post-treatment participants reported physical, social, psychological and economic changes as consequences of their RR-TB disease and treatment. Many participants reported a diminished ability to perform physical activities and, once discharged from the RR-TB hospital, inadequate physical rehabilitation. For some, these physical limitations impacted on their social life, and ultimately on their psychological health as well as on their ability to earn money and support their families.The experiences and impact of RR-TB disease and therapy on post-treatment life of individuals successfully treated, highlights gaps in the current health care system that need to be addressed to improve the life of individuals post-treatment. A more holistic and long-term view of post-TB health, including the provision of comprehensive medical and social services for post-treatment care of physical ailments, social re-integration and the mitigation of the perceived fear and risk of getting TB again could be a central part of person-centred TB care."
https://openalex.org/W3206423832,"Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) harboring one KRAS mutant allele often displays increasing genomic loss of the remaining wild-type (WT) allele (known as LOH at KRAS) as tumors progress to metastasis, yet the molecular ramification of this WT allelic loss is unknown. In this study, we showed that the restoration of WT KRAS expression in human PDAC cell lines with LOH at KRAS significantly attenuated the malignancy of PDAC cells both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating a tumor-suppressive role of the WT KRAS allele. Through RNA-Seq, we identified the HIPPO signaling pathway to be positively regulated by WT KRAS in PDAC cells. In accordance with this observation, PDAC cells with LOH at KRAS exhibited increased nuclear localization and activation of transcriptional co-activator YAP1. Mechanistically, we discovered that WT KRAS expression sequestered YAP1 from the nucleus, through enhanced 14-3-3zeta interaction with phosphorylated YAP1 at S127. Consistently, expression of a constitutively-active YAP1 mutant in PDAC cells bypassed the growth inhibitory effects of WT KRAS. In patient samples, we found that the YAP1-activation genes were significantly upregulated in tumors with LOH at KRAS, and YAP1 nuclear localization predicted poor survival for PDAC patients. Collectively, our results reveal that the WT allelic loss leads to functional activation of YAP1 and enhanced tumor malignancy, which explains the selection advantage of the tumor cells with LOH at KRAS during pancreatic cancer clonal evolution and progression to metastasis, and should be taken into consideration in future therapeutic strategies targeting KRAS."
https://openalex.org/W3206889514,"FKBP12 was identified as a binding protein of tacrolimus (Tac). Tac binds to FKBP12 and exhibits immunosuppressive effects in T cells. Although it is reported that Tac treatment directly ameliorates the dysfunction of the podocyte in nephrotic syndrome, the precise pharmacological mechanism of Tac is not well understood yet. It is also known that FKBP12 functions independently of Tac. However, the localization and the physiological function of FKBP12 are not well elucidated. In this study, we observed that FKBP12 is highly expressed in glomeruli, and the FKBP12 in glomeruli is restricted in podocytes. FKBP12 in cultured podocytes was expressed along the actin cytoskeleton and associated with filamentous actin (F-actin). FKBP12 interacted with the actin-associated proteins 14-3-3 and synaptopodin. RNA silencing for FKBP12 reduced 14-3-3 expression, F-actin staining, and process formation in cultured podocytes. FKBP12 expression was decreased in the nephrotic model caused by adriamycin (ADR) and the cultured podocyte treated with ADR. The process formation was deteriorated in the podocytes treated with ADR. Tac treatment ameliorated these decreases. Tac treatment to the normal cells increased the expression of FKBP12 at F-actin in processes and enhanced process formation. Tac enhanced the interaction of FKBP12 with synaptopodin. These observations suggested that FKBP12 at actin cytoskeleton participates in the maintenance of processes, and Tac treatment ameliorates podocyte injury by restoring FKBP12 at actin cytoskeleton."

While its composition is relatively stable throughout adulthood, the microbial balance starts to decrease in later life stages. Thus, in order to maintain a good quality of life, including the prevention of age-associated diseases in the elderly, it is important to understand the dynamics of the intestinal microbiome. In this study, stool samples of 278 participants were sequenced by whole metagenome shotgun sequencing and their taxonomic and functional profiles characterized. The two age groups, below65 and above65, could be separated based on taxonomic and associated functional features using Multivariate Association of Linear Models. In a second approach, through machine learning, biomarkers connecting the intestinal microbiome with age were identified. These results reflect the importance to select age-matched study groups for unbiased metagenomic data analysis and the possibility to generate robust data by applying independent algorithms for data analysis. Furthermore, since the intestinal microbiome can be modulated by antibiotics and probiotics, the data of this study may have implications on preventive strategies of age-associated degradation processes and diseases by microbiome-altering interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3207275675,"Victims of childhood trauma report shame and anticipation of stigma, leading to non-disclosure and avoidance of help. Stigma is potentially aggravating the mental health consequences of childhood trauma. So far there is no comprehensive study examining stigma toward adult survivors of various forms of childhood trauma, and it is unclear whether stigma interferes with reaching out to affected individuals. In a vignette study based on a representative sample of the German general population (N = 1320; 47.7% male) we randomly allocated participants to brief case vignettes pertaining to past childhood sexual/physical abuse or accidents, and adult physical abuse. Stigma was elicited by applying the Social Distance Scale, assessing respondents' attitudes/stereotypes toward the persons in the vignette and their reluctance to address the specific trauma in conversation. While one aim was to establish the prevalence of stigma toward persons with CT, we hypothesized that attitudes differ according to type of trauma. Of the respondents, 45% indicated they were unlikely to reach out to a victim of childhood sexual abuse, 38% to a victim of childhood physical abuse, 31% to someone reporting a childhood accident and 25% to someone reporting adult physical abuse. Contrary to our expectations, childhood sexual abuse did not consistently elicit more stigma than childhood physical abuse in Krukall-Wallis tests. Equally, childhood interpersonal trauma did not consistently elicit more stigma than childhood accidental trauma. Structural equation modeling revealed social distance as mediator of the relationship between negative stereotypes and reluctance to address childhood trauma in conversation. Our analyses further revealed an ambiguous role of negative stereotypes in addressing childhood trauma in conversation with trauma victims, which has yet to be examined. There is evidence for stigma associated with having survived childhood trauma, which is interfering with offering help."
https://openalex.org/W3206024592,"Energetic metabolism controls key steps of kidney development, homeostasis, and epithelial repair following acute kidney injury (AKI). Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) is a master transcription factor that controls mitochondrial function in proximal tubule (PT) cells. Patients with HNF1B pathogenic variant display a wide range of kidney developmental abnormalities and progressive kidney fibrosis. Characterizing the metabolic changes in PT cells with HNF-1β deficiency may help to identify new targetable molecular hubs involved in HNF1B-related kidney phenotypes and AKI. Here, we combined 1 H-NMR-based metabolomic analysis in a murine PT cell line with CrispR/Cas9-induced Hnf1b invalidation (Hnf1b-/- ), clustering analysis, targeted metabolic assays, and datamining of published RNA-seq and ChIP-seq dataset to identify the role of HNF-1β in metabolism. Hnf1b-/- cells grown in normoxic conditions display intracellular ATP depletion, increased cytosolic lactate concentration, increased lipid droplet content, failure to use pyruvate for energetic purposes, increased levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and oxidized glutathione, and a reduction of TCA cycle byproducts, all features consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction and an irreversible switch toward glycolysis. Unsupervised clustering analysis showed that Hnf1b-/- cells mimic a hypoxic signature and that they cannot furthermore increase glycolysis-dependent energetic supply during hypoxic challenge. Metabolome analysis also showed alteration of phospholipid biosynthesis in Hnf1b-/- cells leading to the identification of Chka, the gene coding for choline kinase α, as a new putative target of HNF-1β. HNF-1β shapes the energetic metabolism of PT cells and HNF1B deficiency in patients could lead to a hypoxia-like metabolic state precluding further adaptation to ATP depletion following AKI."
https://openalex.org/W3206687743,"It has been recently recognized that prenatal androgen exposure is involved in the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adulthood. In addition, the gut microbiome in adult patients and rodents with PCOS differs from that of healthy individuals. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that the gut microbiome may play a causative role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. We wondered whether prenatal androgen exposure induces gut microbial dysbiosis early in life and is associated with the development of PCOS in later life. To test this hypothesis, we studied the development of PCOS-like phenotypes in prenatally androgenized (PNA) female mice and compared the gut microbiome of PNA and control offspring from 4 to 16 weeks of age. PNA offspring showed a reproductive phenotype from 6 weeks and a metabolic phenotype from 12 weeks of age. The α-diversity of the gut microbiome of the PNA group was higher at 8 weeks and lower at 12 and 16 weeks of age, and the β-diversity differed from control at 8 weeks. However, a significant difference in the composition of gut microbiome between the PNA and control groups was already apparent at 4 weeks. Allobaculum and Roseburia were less abundant in PNA offspring, and may therefore be targets for future interventional studies. In conclusion, abnormalities in the gut microbiome appear as early as or even before PCOS-like phenotypes develop in PNA mice. Thus, the gut microbiome in early life is a potential target for the prevention of PCOS in later life."
https://openalex.org/W3207122142,"Background We previously described the association between rare ADAMTS13 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Moreover, DVT patients with at least one rare ADAMTS13 SNV had a lower ADAMTS13 activity than non-carriers. Aims To confirm ADAMTS13 variants association with DVT and reduced plasma ADAMTS13 activity levels in a larger population. To investigate the role of VWF and F8 variants. Methods ADAMTS13 , VWF and F8 were sequenced using next-generation sequencing in 594 Italian DVT patients and 571 controls. Genetic association testing was performed using logistic regression and gene-based tests. The association between rare ADAMTS13 variants and the respective plasmatic activity, available for 365 cases and 292 controls, was determined using linear regression. All analyses were age-, sex- adjusted. Results We identified 48 low-frequency/common and 272 rare variants. Nine low-frequency/common variants had a P&lt;0.05, but a false discovery rate between 0.06 and 0.24. Of them, 7 were found in ADAMTS13 (rs28641026, rs28503257, rs685523, rs3124768, rs3118667, rs739469, rs3124767; all protective) and 2 in VWF (rs1800382 [risk], rs7962217 [protective]). Rare ADAMTS13 variants were significantly associated with DVT using the burden, variable threshold (VT) and UNIQ (P&lt;0.05), but not with C-ALPHA, SKAT and SKAT-O tests. Rare VWF and F8 variants were not associated with DVT. Carriers of rare ADAMTS13 variants had lower ADAMTS13 activity than non-carriers (ß -6.2, 95%CI -11,-1.5). This association was stronger for DVT patients than controls (ß -7.5, 95%CI -13.5,-1.5 vs. ß -2.9, 95%CI -10.4,4.5). Conclusions ADAMTS13 and VWF low-frequency/common variants mainly showed a protective effect, although their association with DVT was not confirmed. DVT patients carrying a rare ADAMTS13 variants had slightly reduced ADAMTS13 activity levels, but a higher DVT risk. Rare VWF and FVIII variants were not associated with DVT suggesting that other mechanisms are responsible for the high VWF and FVIII levels measured in DVT patients."
https://openalex.org/W3205248144,"Biomedical and life science literature is an essential way to publish experimental results. With the rapid growth of the number of new publications, the amount of scientific knowledge represented in free text is increasing remarkably. There has been much interest in developing techniques that can extract this knowledge and make it accessible to aid scientists in discovering new relationships between biological entities and answering biological questions. Making use of the word2vec approach, we generated word vector representations based on a corpus consisting of over 16 million PubMed abstracts. We developed a text mining pipeline to produce word2vec embeddings with different properties and performed validation experiments to assess their utility for biomedical analysis. An important pre-processing step consisted in the substitution of synonymous terms by their preferred terms in biomedical databases. Furthermore, we extracted gene-gene networks from two embedding versions and used them as prior knowledge to train Graph-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on large breast cancer gene expression data and on other cancer datasets. Performances of resulting models were compared to Graph-CNNs trained with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks or with networks derived using other word embedding algorithms. We also assessed the effect of corpus size on the variability of word representations. Finally, we created a web service with a graphical and a RESTful interface to extract and explore relations between biomedical terms using annotated embeddings. Comparisons to biological databases showed that relations between entities such as known PPIs, signaling pathways and cellular functions, or narrower disease ontology groups correlated with higher cosine similarity. Graph-CNNs trained with word2vec-embedding-derived networks performed sufficiently good for the metastatic event prediction tasks compared to other networks. Such performance was good enough to validate the utility of our generated word embeddings in constructing biological networks. Word representations as produced by text mining algorithms like word2vec, therefore are able to capture biologically meaningful relations between entities. Our generated embeddings are publicly available at https://github.com/genexplain/Word2vec-based-Networks/blob/main/README.md."
https://openalex.org/W3206901906,"Neddylation is a posttranslational modification that attaches ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 to protein targets via Nedd8-specific E1-E2-E3 enzymes and modulates many important biological processes. Nedd8 attaches to a lysine residue of a substrate, not for degradation, but for modulation of substrate activity. We previously identified the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, which controls diverse cellular processes, is activated by Nedd8 through covalent neddylation. Smurf1 functions as a thioester bond-type Nedd8 ligase to catalyze its own neddylation. Numerous ubiquitination substrates of Smurf1 have been identified, but the neddylation substrates of Smurf1 remain unknown. Here, we show that Smurf1 interacts with RRP9, a core component of the U3 snoRNP complex, which is involved in pre-rRNA processing. Our in vivo and in vitro neddylation modification assays show that RRP9 is conjugated with Nedd8. RRP9 neddylation is catalyzed by Smurf1 and removed by the NEDP1 deneddylase. We identified Lys221 as a major neddylation site on RRP9. Deficiency of RRP9 neddylation inhibits pre-rRNA processing and leads to downregulation of ribosomal biogenesis. Consequently, functional studies suggest that ectopic expression of RRP9 promotes tumor cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration, whereas unneddylated RRP9, K221R mutant has no such effect. Furthermore, in human colorectal cancer, elevated expression of RRP9 and Smurf1 correlates with cancer progression. These results reveal that Smurf1 plays a multifaceted role in pre-rRNA processing by catalyzing RRP9 neddylation and shed new light on the oncogenic role of RRP9.

Ribosome synthesis is highly conserved and regulated. It requires the coordinated cooperation of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, transcription factors, small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), and ribosomal proteins (1Henras A.K. Soudet J. Gerus M.

Ribosomes in eukaryotes are composed of a 40S small ribosomal subunit (containing 18S rRNA) and a 60S large ribosomal subunit (containing 5S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and 28S rRNA) (4Baßler J. Hurt E. Eukaryotic ribosome assembly.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2019; 88: 281-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The initial 47S precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) is cleaved to form the mature 28S, 18S, and 5.8S rRNAs. Maturation of pre-rRNAs requires snoRNPs to undergo numerous posttranscriptional modifications. SnoRNAs are classified into seven categories, which are numbered U1–U7 due to their rich U content (5Ojha S. Malla S.

SnoRNAs exist only in the nucleus; U3 is present in nucleoli and is associated with the maturation of 18S rRNA in nucleoli, while the other six snoRNAs are present in the nucleoplasm and are associated with the splicing processing of precursor mRNAs (7Kass S.

U3 snoRNAs mainly interact with proteins containing a C/D frame structure to form U3 snoRNPs. Among those proteins, Nop1, Nop56, Nop58, and Snu13 are common to all C/D box snoRNAs, whereas RRP9, also called U3-55K, is a late cloned and identified member of the U3 snoRNA–protein complex. RRP9 is identified as a core subunit of the U3-snoRNP complex (9Beltrame M. Tollervey D.

Neddylation is a cascade of ATP-catalyzed enzymatic reactions mediated by an activating enzyme (E1, a heterologous dimer composed of UBA3 and NAE1/APP-BP1), two conjugating enzymes (E2s, UBE2M/Ubc12, and UBE2F) and a variety of E3 ligases (13Enchev R.I.

In this study, RRP9 was identified as a neddylation substrate of Smurf1. RRP9 neddylation promotes pre-rRNA processing, resulting in promotion of cell proliferation. Smurf1 deletion decreases the efficiency of pre-rRNA processing, and this effect is reversed by reintroduction of wild-type RRP9 but not its neddylation-depleted K221R mutant. Therefore, RRP9 neddylation mediated by Smurf1 has an important function in pre-rRNA synthesis. Furthermore, increased expression of Smurf1 and RRP9 shows a positive correlation with human colon cancer progression. These findings characterize the functional diversity of neddylation and reveal a new mechanism of Smurf1 in tumorigenesis. High-throughput mapping of the dynamic TGF-β signaling network identified a series of potential Smurf1-interacting proteins, among which RRP9 was included (35Barrios-Rodiles M. Brown K.R. Ozdamar B. Bose R. Liu Z. Donovan R.S. Shinjo F. Liu Y. Dembowy J. Taylor I.W. Luga V. Przulj N. Robinson M. Suzuki H. Hayashizaki Y. et al.High-throughput mapping of a dynamic signaling network in mammalian cells.Science. 2005; 307: 1621-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). To further support the interaction, affinity purification and mass spectrometry were first employed to investigate the Smurf1 interactome. Whole-cell extracts were prepared and subjected to affinity purification on an anti-Smurf1 affinity gel. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that Smurf1 was copurified with RRP9 (Figs. 1A and S1A). Endogenous RRP9 was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with Smurf1 (Figs. 1B and S1B). Smurf1 was shown to interact with endogenous RRP9 (Fig. 1C). The glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay indicated that the interaction between RRP9 and Smurf1 seemed to be direct (Fig. 1D). In addition, Smurf1 colocalized with RRP9 in the nuclei of HCT116 cells (Fig. 1E). Then, full-length Myc-tagged RRP9 and the 1 to 144 aa and 145 to 475 aa truncations were transfected into HCT116 cells. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody against Myc-tagged proteins followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against Smurf1 showed that Smurf1 was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with the WD40 domain (aa 145–475) of RRP9. (Fig. 1, G and H). Collectively, these data indicated that RRP9 was a Smurf1-specific interacting partner. Considering that Smurf1 is an E3 ligase for both ubiquitin and Nedd8, we first intended to investigate whether RRP9 can be ubiquitinated by Smurf1. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, did not affect the protein stability of RRP9 compared with that of Smurf1 (Fig. 2A). In addition, knockout of Smurf1 did not affect the protein stability of RRP9 in HCT116 cells or mice (Fig. 2, B and C). The C426A mutation abolishes the catalytic activity of the Smurf1 neddylation ligase (29Xie P. Zhang M. He S. Lu K. Chen Y. Xing G. Lu Y. Liu P. Li Y. Wang S. Chai N. Wu J. Deng H. Wang H.R. Cao Y. et al.The covalent modifier Nedd8 is critical for the activation of Smurf1 ubiquitin ligase in tumorigenesis.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, we intended to detect the expression of RRP9 in Smurf1−/− and Smurf1C426A knock-in (KI) mice. The data showed that the protein level of RRP9 in Smurf1−/− and Smurf1C426A KI mice did not differ from that in Smurf1+/+ mice (Fig. S2A), and the same result was found for its mRNA level (Fig. S2B). These data strongly indicated that Smurf1 does not affect the protein stability of RRP9 via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Next, we investigated whether RRP9 can be neddylated by Smurf1. To date, RRP9 neddylation has not been reported in the literature. To further evaluate this modification, immunoprecipitation (IP) under partial denaturing conditions was performed with an anti-RRP9 antibody in HCT116 cells, and the precipitates were detected as smeared bands. The densities of the smeared bands were clearly reduced by treatment with the E1 inhibitor MLN4924 (Fig. 2D). When Nedd8 was ectopically expressed, RRP9 migrated as a high-molecular-weight band, but the smeared bands were not produced from the lysate of cells expressing Nedd8-ΔGG, a mutant incapable of covalent conjugation to its substrates (Fig. 2E), suggesting that the smeared bands correspond to Nedd8-conjugated RRP9. Moreover, knockout of NEDP1 by sgRNA increased RRP9 neddylation (Fig. 2F), which indicated that NEDP1 is the deneddylase for RRP9. These data suggested that RRP9 was conjugated with Nedd8. We next determined whether Smurf1 is involved in RRP9 neddylation. Immunoprecipitation under partial denaturing conditions was performed with an anti-RRP9 antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed. The results revealed that endogenous RRP9 was covalently conjugated to Nedd8 but not ubiquitin in the colon tissues of Smurf1+/+ mice (Fig. 2G, Lane 2; Fig. 2H, Lane 2). We found that RRP9 neddylation was almost completely abolished in Smurf1−/− and Smurf1C426A KI mice (Fig. 2G, Lane 3; Fig. 2H, Lane 3). In addition, RRP9 neddylation was markedly reduced with deletion of UBA3 (neddylation E1), Ubc12 (neddylation E2), and Smurf1 using target sgRNAs (Fig. 2I). In addition, ectopic expression of Smurf1 markedly enhanced the neddylation of RRP9 (Fig. 2J). Finally, in vitro neddylation assays were performed with purified RRP9, Smurf1, Nedd8, NAE (E1), and Ubc12 (E2). The results showed that Smurf1 catalyzed RRP9 neddylation in vitro (Fig. 2K). Collectively, these data supported the hypothesis that Smurf1 is likely the major Nedd8 E3 ligase for RRP9. Analysis of the RRP9 sequence showed that it contained a total of 29 lysines: 7 lysines in the N-terminal domain, 8 lysines in the Glu-rich region, 13 lysines in the WD40 domain, and 1 lysine in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3A). We generated RRP9 truncations to identify the neddylation regions in RRP9. The results in HCT116 cells showed that the 1 to 144 aa region in RRP9 could not be neddylated, indicating that these 15 lysines were not RRP9 neddylation sites (Fig. 3B). Then, individual K-R mutations in the region from 145 aa to 475 aa, which contains 14 lysines in RRP9, were introduced to identify the sites of Nedd8 covalent conjugation. The K221R mutant exhibited almost no neddylation compared with the other K-R mutants (Fig. 3C). Further in vitro neddylation assays confirmed that Smurf1 could not catalyze RRP9 K221R neddylation (Fig. 3D). Therefore, these data suggested that K221 was the major site of RRP9 neddylation. The role of RRP9 in tumor prognosis remains unknown. Next, we explored the role of RRP9 in tumorigenesis. We generated stably transduced HCT116 colon cancer cells by performing lentiviral transduction with Lenti-sgNC (negative control) and Lenti-sgRRP9 (Fig. S3A). The CCK-8 and colony formation assay results indicated that deletion of RRP9 notably inhibited cell proliferation (Fig. 4, A and B). Knockout of RRP9 decreased tumor cell migration (Fig. 4C). Then, we intended to determine whether RRP9 affects cellular senescence in tumors. SA-β-Gal staining showed that deletion of RRP9 increased tumor cell senescence (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, loss of RRP9 obviously inhibited tumor growth in xenografted nude mice (Fig. 4, E–G). Consistent with previous findings, knockout of RRP9 led to a reduction in the total 18S rRNA level (Fig. 4H). Ribosome assembly is coupled with irreversible pre-rRNA processing, which is a classical hallmark of cell growth and proliferation. Therefore, interference with ribosomal biogenesis is often associated with cancer. RRP9 is reported to be essential for U3 snoRNP assembly and ribosomal RNA maturation (36Newman D.R. Kuhn J.F. Shanab G.M. Maxwell E.S.

Implication of the box C/D snoRNP assembly factor Rsa1p in U3 snoRNP assembly.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 7455-7473Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Enlarged nucleoli are typically associated with activation of ribosome biogenesis. Silver staining was used for the identification of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs). RRP9 knockout resulted in a lower average AgNOR area of positive silver staining. This suggested that knockout of RRP9 leads to downregulation of ribosomal biogenesis (Fig. 4I). Collectively, the aforementioned data suggested that loss of RRP9 inhibited tumor cell growth and migration. To gain insight into the role of RRP9 neddylation in cancer progression, we reintroduced sgRNA-resistant RRP9-WT and K221R into HCT116 cells with RRP9 deletion (Fig. S3B). Then, RNA was labeled with biotin and analyzed by fluorography. Consistent with previous findings, the data revealed that the amount of 18S rRNA was reduced in RRP9-knockout cells (Fig. 5A, Lane 2). Notably, reintroduction of wild-type RRP9 rescued this effect, whereas reintroduction of the neddylation-deficient mutant of RRP9 (K221R) did not restore processing (Fig. 5A, Lanes 3 and 4). Next, AgNORs were identified to evaluate alterations in nucleolar morphology. Silver staining showed that RRP9 knockout resulted in a reduction in the average AgNOR area, while ectopic expression of RRP9-WT markedly reversed these effects. RRP9-K221R overexpression had no such effect (Fig. 5B). This suggested that RRP9 neddylation leads to upregulation of ribosomal biogenesis. Considering that elevated ribosomal biogenesis is typically associated with stimulation of cell proliferation (38Pelletier J. Thomas G. Volarevic S. Ribosome biogenesis in cancer: New players and therapeutic avenues.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2018; 18: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 39Kampen K.R. Sulima S.O. Vereecke S. Keersmaecker K.D. Hallmarks of ribosomopathies.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 1013-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we then investigated tumor cell proliferation changes resulting from RRP9 neddylation. The growth curves showed a reduced cell growth rate resulting from RRP9 deletion (Fig. 5, C and D). Reintroduction of RRP9-WT significantly promoted cell proliferation. In contrast, reintroduction of RRP9-K221R into these cells caused a nonsignificant increase in tumor growth (Fig. 5, C and D). Moreover, ectopic expression of RRP9 markedly enhanced tumor cell migration, but overexpression of RRP9-K221R had no such effect (Fig. 5E). Collectively, these data indicated that RRP9 neddylation promoted pre-rRNA processing and activation of ribosomal biogenesis, which resulted in enhanced tumor cell proliferation and migration. If Smurf1-mediated RRP9 neddylation is required for proper 18S rRNA processing, depletion of either RRP9 or Smurf1 should cause similar defects in pre-rRNA processing. In fact, the function of Smurf1 in pre-rRNA synthesis remains unknown. We generated a cell line with stable deletion of Smurf1 to investigate pre-rRNA synthesis (Fig. 6A). Fluorographic analysis indicated that the amount of 18S rRNA was reduced in Smurf1-knockout cells (Fig. 6, B–D). Total RNA was extracted and resolved on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel. These results also showed that knockout of RRP9 led to a decrease in the total 18S rRNA abundance (Fig. S3C). Furthermore, Smurf1 knockout resulted in a decrease in nucleoli (Fig. 6E). Therefore, it was concluded that deletion of Smurf1 inhibited pre-rRNA processing. Smurf1 plays an oncogenic role in colon cancer (29Xie P. Zhang M. He S. Lu K. Chen Y. Xing G. Lu Y. Liu P. Li Y. Wang S. Chai N. Wu J. Deng H. Wang H.R. Cao Y. et al.The covalent modifier Nedd8 is critical for the activation of Smurf1 ubiquitin ligase in tumorigenesis.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We intended to explore whether Smurf1 promotes tumorigenesis by regulating pre-rRNA processing. Consistent with previous findings, Smurf1 knockout resulted in marked decreases in the tumor cell growth rate (Fig. 6, F and G) and cell migration (Fig. 6H), and Smurf1-knockout cells displayed indications of severe senescence defects (Fig. 6I). Next, sgSmurf1-cotransfected RRP9-WT and RRP9-K221R cell lines were generated (Fig. S3D). Silver staining showed that Smurf1 knockout resulted in a reduction in the average AgNOR area. Ectopic expression of RRP9-WT markedly reversed these effects, but overexpression of RRP9-K221R had almost no effect (Fig. 6J), indicating that neddylation of RRP9 might be important but not essential for Smurf1 to accelerate pre-rRNA processing. Moreover, deletion of Smurf1 markedly suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration, whereas introduction of wild-type RRP9 rescued the processing defect (Fig. 6, K–M). However, introduction of the neddylation-deficient mutant of RRP9 (K221R) did not restore processing (Fig. 6, K–M). These data demonstrated that the oncogenic role of Smurf1 was involved in the positive regulation of pre-rRNA synthesis by catalyzing RRP9 neddylation. Previous data indicated that Nedd8-mediated Smurf1 activation promotes colon cancer progression (29Xie P. Zhang M. He S. Lu K. Chen Y. Xing G. Lu Y. Liu P. Li Y. Wang S. Chai N. Wu J. Deng H. Wang H.R. Cao Y. et al.The covalent modifier Nedd8 is critical for the activation of Smurf1 ubiquitin ligase in tumorigenesis.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Human colorectal cancer tissue samples and matched adjacent normal tissue samples were evaluated to investigate the potential clinical relevance of RRP9 in colon cancer. Compared with that in distal and adjacent tissues, RRP9 expression was notably increased in tumor tissues (Fig. 7, A and B). The samples were divided into groups based on the tumor stage to better understand the correlation of RRP9 with colon cancer progression. The results showed that the expression of RRP9 was lower in low-TNM stage tumors and higher in high-TNM stage tumors (Fig. 7, C and D). Consistent with previous findings, these results also indicated that Smurf1 was significantly upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues compared with matched adjacent tissues (Fig. 7, E and F), in addition to the high expression of RRP9 in tumor tissues (Fig. 7, E and G). Importantly, a positive correlation of Smurf1 with RRP9 was observed among patients with tumors (Fig. 7H). Both the expression and neddylation of RRP9 were clearly upregulated in patients with colorectal cancer (Fig. 7, I–K). Taken together, these data suggested that RRP9 was highly expressed in colon cancer, concomitant with the enhancement of Smurf1-catalyzed RRP9 neddylation, to promote tumor progression. Previous studies reported that Nedd8 ligases such as Dcn1, Roc1/Rbx1, IAPs, c-Cbl, RNF111, RNF168, and MDM2 are all RING finger scaffold-type E3s. Smurf1 is the first identified HECT-type Nedd8 ligase to supplement the classification of Nedd8 ligases. Smurf1 integrates the ubiquitination and neddylation pathways as a dual E3 ligase. Smurf1 forms a Nedd8-thioester intermediate and then catalyzes its own neddylation on multiple lysine residues. This neddylation enhances Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination (29Xie P. Zhang M. He S. Lu K.

https://openalex.org/W3207190413,"Usually, studies on the informal economy focus mainly upon those working in the informal economy (supply side). However, many exchanges in the informal economy are initiated by purchasers asking how much a good or service costs if paid cash in hand. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to advance understanding of who make purchases in the informal economy and the reasons of the consumers making these purchases (demand side). Two potential explanations are evaluated. Firstly, consumers are explained as rational economic actors seeking a more convenient deal or profit maximisation (i.e., lower price or better value for money), making purchases from the informal economy due to the lack of availability of the product or service they need on the formal market, or they make such purchases involuntarily, due to the lack of perfect information necessary to make a fully rational economic decision when purchasing. Secondly, the consumers are portrayed as social actors pursuing community help. Using a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analysis on a 2019 Eurobarometer interviews in 27 EU member states and the UK reveal how the prevalence of these motives significantly varies across populations and regions. The theoretical and policy implications of the findings are discussed in the concluding section."
https://openalex.org/W3205599113,"The E6 protein of the human papillomavirus (HPV) underpins important protein interaction networks between the virus and host to promote viral infection. Through its interaction with E6AP, a host E3 ubiquitin (UB) ligase, E6 stirs the protein ubiquitination pathways toward the oncogenic transformation of the infected cells. For a systematic measurement of E6 reprogramming of the substrate pool of E6AP, we performed a proteomic screen based on ""orthogonal UB transfer (OUT)"" that allowed us to identify the ubiquitination targets of E6AP dependent on the E6 protein of HPV-16, a high-risk viral subtype for the development of cervical cancer. The OUT screen identified more than 200 potential substrates of the E6-E6AP pair based on the transfer of UB from E6AP to the substrate proteins. Among them, we verified that E6 would induce E6AP-catalyzed ubiquitination of importin proteins KPNA1-3, protein phosphatase PGAM5, and arginine methyltransferases CARM1 to trigger their degradation by the proteasome. We further found that E6 could significantly reduce the cellular level of KPNA1 that resulted in the suppression of nuclear transport of phosphorylated STAT1 and the inhibition of interferon-γ-induced apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. Overall, our work demonstrates OUT as a powerful proteomic platform to probe the interaction of E6 and host cells through protein ubiquitination and reveals a new role of E6 in down-regulating nuclear transport proteins to attenuate tumor-suppressive signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3205715508,"This study analyzed meteorological constraints on winter wheat yield in the northern Japanese island, Hokkaido, and developed a machine learning model to predict municipality-level yields from meteorological data. Compared to most wheat producing areas, this island is characterized by wet climate owing to greater annual precipitation and abundant snowmelt water supply in spring. Based on yield statistics collected from 119 municipalities for 14 years ( N = 1,516) and high-resolution surface meteorological data, correlation analyses showed that precipitation, daily minimum air temperature, and irradiance during the grain-filling period had significant effects on the yield throughout the island while the effect of snow depth in early winter and spring was dependent on sites. Using 10-d mean meteorological data within a certain period between seeding and harvest as predictor variables and one-year-leave-out cross-validation procedure, performance of machine learning models based on neural network (NN), random forest (RF), support vector machine regression (SVR), partial least squares regression (PLS), and cubist regression (CB) were compared to a multiple linear regression model (MLR) and a null model that returns an average yield of the municipality. The root mean square errors of PLS, SVR, and RF were 872, 982, and 1,024 kg ha −1 and were smaller than those of MLR (1,068 kg ha −1 ) and null model (1,035 kg ha −1 ). These models outperformed the controls in other metrics including Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Variable importance analysis on PLS indicated that minimum air temperature and precipitation during the grain-filling period had major roles in the prediction and excluding predictors in this period (i.e. yield forecast with a longer lead-time) decreased forecast performance of the models. These results were consistent with our understanding of meteorological impacts on wheat yield, suggesting usefulness of explainable machine learning in meteorological crop yield prediction under wet climate."
https://openalex.org/W3206853607,"To mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, some countries have adopted more stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions in contrast to those widely used. In addition to standard practices such as enforcing curfews, social distancing, and closure of non-essential service industries, other non-conventional policies also have been implemented, such as the total lockdown of fragmented regions, which are composed of sparsely and highly populated areas.In this paper, we model the movement of a host population using a mechanistic approach based on random walks, which are either diffusive or super-diffusive. Infections are realised through a contact process, whereby a susceptible host is infected if in close spatial proximity of the infectious host with an assigned transmission probability. Our focus is on a short-time scale (∼ 3 days), which is the average time lag time before an infected individual becomes infectious.We find that the level of infection remains approximately constant with an increase in population diffusion, and also in the case of faster population dispersal (super-diffusion). Moreover, we demonstrate how the efficacy of imposing a lockdown depends heavily on how susceptible and infectious individuals are distributed over space.Our results indicate that on a short-time scale, the type of movement behaviour does not play an important role in rising infection levels. Also, lock-down restrictions are ineffective if the population distribution is homogeneous. However, in the case of a heterogeneous population, lockdowns are effective if a large proportion of infectious carriers are distributed in sparsely populated sub-regions."

Although it has been well established that binding of TGF-β to its receptors leads to the recruitment and activation of Smad2, the spatiotemporal mechanism by which Smad2 is recruited to the activated TGF-β receptor complex and activated is not fully understood. Here we show that Smad2 selectively and tightly binds phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the PM.

In the consensus model of canonical Smad-mediated TGF-β signaling, TGF-β binds to the type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII), which leads to recruitment of the type I TGF-β receptor (TβRI) into a heteromeric receptor complex, enabling TβRII to trans-phosphorylate serines and a threonine in the juxtamembrane Gly-Ser-rich sequence (GS domain) of TβRI (1Derynck R.

TGF-beta signaling from receptors to Smads.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8a022061Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation and resulting conformational changes result in the release of FKBP12 and the recruitment of regulatory Smad (R- Smad), most notably Smad2 and Smad3, to the activated TβRI (3Huse M.

Miyazono K. Regulation of TGF-beta family signaling by inhibitory Smads.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2017; 9a022095Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). TβRI then phosphorylates two C-terminal serines (S465 and S467) of the bound Smad2 (or Smad3), and these receptor-activated R-Smads dissociate from the complex and associate with a co-Smad (Smad4) (1Derynck R.

The Smad2/3/4 complex then enters the nucleus where they associate with other transcription cofactors at Smad-binding regulatory DNA sequences of target genes, thus directly modulating target gene expression (1Derynck R.

Contextual determinants of TGFbeta action in development, immunity and cancer.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 419-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although this model is widely accepted, there is a major gap in our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the active TGF-β receptor complex and the mechanism by which Smad2 and/or Smad3 are recruited to the complex. It has been reported that Smad-dependent canonical TGF-β signaling takes place in endocytic clathrin-coated pits of the plasma membrane (PM) (6Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Distinct endocytic pathways regulate TGF-beta receptor signalling and turnover.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that an FYVE domain-containing protein, Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA), recruits Smad2 and/or Smad3 to the TGF-β receptor complex at early endosomes (EEs) through its binding to phosphatidylinositol-3-monophosphate (PI(3)P) and the endocytosed TGF-β receptor complex at EEs (7Tsukazaki T.

Although these findings suggest that clathrin-dependent internalization of the TGF-β receptors is a crucial step for Smad-mediated TGF-β signaling and that EEs are a main site for Smad-mediated TGF-β signaling, these notions have been challenged by other reports. First, it has been reported that Smad-mediated TGF-β signaling can be initiated from the PM without requirement of endocytosis (8Lu Z. Murray J.T. Luo W. Li H. Wu X. Xu H. Backer J.M. Chen Y.G.

Furthermore, the direct involvement of SARA in TGF-β signaling has been disputed (11Bakkebo M. Huse K. Hilden V.I. Forfang L. Myklebust J.H. Smeland E.B. Oksvold M.P.

In this study, we explored the possibility that targeting of Smad2 to the activated TGF-β receptor complex is controlled by their direct interaction with membrane lipids. Our membrane binding studies as well as quantitative cell imaging studies show that Smad2 binds phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) enriched in the PM more tightly than PI(3)P abundant in EEs. Our results also show that the PI(4,5)P2-binding activity of Smad2 is essential for its functional interaction with the activated TGF-β receptor complex at the PM and the overall Smad-dependent TGF-β signaling activity. It has been generally thought that Smad2 and Smad3 are targeted to the activated TGF-β signaling complex by direct interaction with TβRI (1Derynck R. Budi E.H. Specificity, versatility, and control of TGF-beta family signaling.Sci. Signal. 2019; 12eaav5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Hata A. Chen Y.G.

Wrana J.L. SARA, a FYVE domain protein that recruits Smad2 to the TGFbeta receptor.Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that many cytosolic proteins that are targeted to membrane proteins or membrane-anchored signaling complexes have affinity for membrane lipids (14Cho W. Building signaling complexes at the membrane.Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006pe7Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), phosphoinositides (PtdInsPs) in particular, and that their membrane recruitment is mediated by coincident lipid–protein and protein–protein interactions (15Cho W. Stahelin R.V. Membrane-protein interactions in cell signaling and membrane trafficking.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2005; 34: 119-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 16Lemmon M.A. Membrane recognition by phospholipid-binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). For most of these proteins, their PtdInsP specificity directs their membrane targeting behaviors: e.g., PI(4,5)P2-specific proteins are recruited to PM where the highest concentration of PI(4,5)P2 is found, whereas PI(3)P-specific proteins are targeted to PI(3)P-rich EEs (17Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Phosphoinositides in cell regulation and membrane dynamics.Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar, 18Balla T. Phosphoinositides: Tiny lipids with giant impact on cell regulation.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 1019-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). To resolve uncertainty about the functional location of the activated TGF-β signaling complex, we thus explored the possibility that lipid-binding activity of Smad2 may play a role in specific targeting of Smad2 to the active TGF-β receptor complex either at the PM or at EEs. Lipid-binding activity of Smad proteins has not been reported to date. We thus measured the binding of bacterially expressed Smad2 to large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) containing various lipids by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis (19Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Differential roles of ionic, aliphatic, and aromatic residues in membrane-protein interactions: A surface plasmon resonance study on phospholipases A2.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Stahelin R.V. Surface plasmon resonance: A useful technique for cell biologists to characterize biomolecular interactions.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Lipid selectivity determined by SPR analysis is typically reported as the relative resonance unit (RU) values for different lipids at a given protein concentration (21Park M.J. Sheng R. Silkov A. Jung D.J. Wang Z.G. Xin Y. Kim H. Thiagarajan-Rosenkranz P. Song S. Yoon Y. Nam W. Kim I. Kim E. Lee D.G. Chen Y. et al.SH2 domains serve as lipid-binding modules for pTyr-signaling proteins.Mol. Cell. 2016; 62: 7-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Sheng R. Jung D.J. Silkov A. Kim H. Singaram I. Wang Z.G. Xin Y. Kim E. Park M.J. Thiagarajan-Rosenkranz P. Smrt S. Honig B. Baek K. Ryu S. Lorieau J. et al.Lipids regulate Lck protein activity through their interactions with the Lck Src homology 2 domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 17639-17650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although simple and intuitive, this type of analysis can sometimes yield misleading and erroneous results because some proteins show widely different RU values when bound to different lipid surfaces. Thus, a more reliable parameter that represents the fraction of the membrane bound protein molecules at a given protein concentration would be a normalized value of RU/RUmax where RUmax indicates the maximal RU value when a given lipid surface is saturated with the protein molecules. We thus estimated RUmax for different lipid species by employing the highest protein concentration experimentally feasible (e.g., 1 μM) and determined RU/RUmax for different lipids at the protein concentration that allows robust comparison (e.g., 100 nM). Once the lipid selectivity has been determined by this semiquantitative approach, we then rigorously determined and compared Kd values for selected lipids for more accurate quantitative determination of lipid selectivity. We first determined by the SPR analysis the PtdInsP selectivity of Smad2 using 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS)/PtdInsP (77:20:3 in molar ratio) LUVs coated onto the L1 sensor chip, with a focus on its relative binding affinity for PI(4,5)P2 versus PI(3)P. As shown in Figure 1A, Smad2 binds PtdInsP-containing anionic vesicles better than POPC/POPS (80:20) vesicles and has a significant degree of selectivity for POPC/POPS/PI(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) over other PtdInsP-containing vesicles, including POPC/POPS/PI(3)P (77:20:3). The fact that Smad2 can distinguish between two similar bisphosphates, PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), indicates that it has a PI(4,5)P2-specific binding pocket. To quantitatively assess its membrane affinity, we then determined the Kd values for selected vesicles by measuring RU/RUmax as a function of the Smad2 concentration (Fig. 1B). The Kd values (Table 1) confirmed that Smad2 has twofold higher affinity for PI(4,5)P2-containing vesicles than for PI(3)P-containing ones and that 3 mol% PI(4,5)P2 caused a large 5.6-fold increase in its membrane affinity over POPC/POPS (80:20) vesicles. We further investigated the PI(4,5)P2 dependence of its membrane binding by measuring RU as a function of PI(4,5)P2 concentration in the vesicles (i.e., POPC/POPS/PI(4,5)P2 (77-x:20:x, x = 0–5 mol%)) (Fig. 1C). The result verifies that membrane binding of Smad2 is dependent on the PI(4,5)P2 concentration. Taken together, our SPR data show that Smad2 is a PI(4,5)P2-dependent membrane-binding protein. They also suggest that its high affinity and selectivity for PI(4,5)P2-containing membranes may dictate its PM recruitment and targeting to the activated TGF-β signaling complex at the PM.Table 1Lipid and peptide-binding activity of Smad2 proteinsProteinsKd for lipid binding (nM)aAverage ±S.D. values determined from SPR analysis (n = 3); see Figure 1B for experimental details.Kd for peptide binding (μM)bAverage ±S.D. values determined from fluorescence anisotropy analysis (n = 3); See Figure 3, A and B for experimental details.PC/PS/PI(4,5)P2PC/PS/PI(3)PPC/PSGS peptideL45 peptideSmad2 WT100 ± 20210 ± 34560 ± 15020 ± 666 ± 4Smad2-K420A120 ± 12NDcNot determined.ND200 ± 48100 ± 16Smad2-W422A470 ± 96NDND21 ± 567 ± 6Smad2-E425K70 ± 7NDND8 ± 0.855 ± 3Smad2-Y426A400 ± 44NDND20 ± 370 ± 7Smad2- R427A/R428A340 ± 53NDND44 ± 475 ± 11Smad3 WT170 ± 15NDNDNDNDa Average ±S.D. values determined from SPR analysis (n = 3); see Figure 1B for experimental details.b Average ±S.D. values determined from fluorescence anisotropy analysis (n = 3); See Figure 3, A and B for experimental details.c Not determined.

Structural basis of Smad2 recognition by the Smad anchor for receptor activation.Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) identified a wide and shallow cationic groove containing aromatic residues in the MH2 domain (Fig. 2, B and C). Molecular docking analysis using the Smad2 structure and a short-chain PI(4,5)P2 model also suggested that the pocket could accommodate a PI(4,5)P2 headgroup making energetically favorable interactions with the 4′- and 5′-phosphate groups of the PI(4,5)P2 molecule (Fig. 2C). When we expressed the isolated MH2 domain and measured its membrane binding by SPR analysis, it had similar PtdInsP selectivity to the full-length (FL) Smad2 (Fig. 1D), supporting the notion that the MH2 domain contains the PI(4,5)P2-binding site. PtdInsP binding of cytosolic proteins is typically driven by two types of interactions, nonspecific contact between the protein and membrane surfaces and specific recognition of a PtdInsP molecule in the binding pocket of the protein (15Cho W. Stahelin R.V. Membrane-protein interactions in cell signaling and membrane trafficking.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2005; 34: 119-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). To identify protein residues involved in the two types of interactions, we performed a series of single- or double-site mutations of residues within (i.e., W422, Y426, R427, and R428) and surrounding (i.e., K420) the putative PI(4,5)P2-binding pocket and measured the effects of the mutations on binding to two different vesicles, POPC/POPS/PI(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) and POPC/POPS (80:20). The former vesicles are for evaluating specific PI(4,5)P2 recognition and the latter for nonspecific binding to anionic membranes. Because of relatively low stability of the MH2 domain, we performed membrane-binding measurements using the FL Smad2 wild-type (WT) (Fig. 2D) and mutants (Fig. 2, E–G). All mutants were expressed stably and in good yield in E. coli, indicating that the mutations did not cause deleterious gross conformational changes. As shown in Figure 2, E–G, W422A, Y426A, and R427A/R428A mutations greatly reduced binding to POPC/POPS/PI(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) while showing much less effects on binding to POPC/POPS (80:20). Consequently, these mutants lost the PI(4,5)P2 selectivity of the WT Smad2 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the K420A mutation modestly and similarly reduced binding to both vesicles (Fig. 2H). These results thus indicate that W422, Y426, R427, and R428 are involved in specific PI(4,5)P2 binding, whereas K420 participates in nonspecific electrostatic interaction with the anionic membrane surface. This notion is consistent with our model predicting that W422, Y426, R427, and R428 constitutes the cationic groove, whereas K420 is located on the protein surface flanking the groove (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, an anionic residue, E425, is located on the same membrane-contacting surface as K420, presumably interfering with nonspecific electrostatic interaction with the anionic membrane surface (Fig. 2, B and C). We thus prepared a charge-reversal mutant (E425K) to generate a potential gain-of-function mutant. As shown in Figure 2I, E425K showed modestly higher membrane binding than WT while retaining the PI(4,5)P2 selectivity of WT. Lastly, we determined the Kd values for these Smad2 mutants. As summarized in Table 1, W422A, Y426A, and R427A/R428A have three- to five-fold lower affinity for POPC/POPS/PI(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) than WT. On the other hand, E425K has ≂40% higher affinity than WT, whereas K420A has only 20% lower affinity than WT. Earlier mutational studies (3Huse M. Muir T.W. Xu L. Chen Y.G. Kuriyan J. Massague J.

Determinants of specificity in TGF-beta signal transduction.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) suggested that two regions of the Smad2 MH2 domain, the H1 helix and L3 loop (see Fig. 2B), may be involved in interaction with the GS domain (aa 185–194) and the L45 loop (aa 265–273) of TβRI, respectively. However, this tentative assignment has been confirmed neither by a high-resolution structure of the Smad2-TβRI complex nor by a quantitative and systematic binding study, leaving uncertainty about the exact nature of the Smad2-TβRI-binding interface. Since the L3 loop is a part of the newly identified PI(4,5)P2-binding site, we checked if these PI(4,5)P2-binding residues are also involved in the Smad2-TβRI interaction using two fluorescein-labeled synthetic peptides derived from the GS region (i.e., GS peptide: fluorescein-aminohexanoyl (F-Ahx)-YDMTTpSGpSGpSGLPLL) and the L45 loop (i.e., L45 peptide: F-Ahx-ADNKDNGT), respectively. In particular, the GS peptide represents the GS motif triply phosphorylated by TβRII. We then measured binding to Smad2 WT and mutants to these peptides by fluorescence anisotropy according to our established protocol (21Park M.J. Sheng R. Silkov A. Jung D.J. Wang Z.G. Xin Y. Kim H. Thiagarajan-Rosenkranz P. Song S. Yoon Y. Nam W. Kim I. Kim E. Lee D.G. Chen Y. et al.SH2 domains serve as lipid-binding modules for pTyr-signaling proteins.Mol. Cell. 2016; 62: 7-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3, A and B (see also Table 1), Smad2 bound the GS peptide 3.3 times more tightly than the L45 peptide, indicating that the phosphorylated GS domain plays a more important role in Smad2 binding than the L45 region. We thus primarily used the GS peptide to assess the effects of mutations on the Smad2-TβRI interaction. As shown in Figure 3A (see also Table 1), the K420A mutation caused a large tenfold decrease in Smad2-GS peptide binding, indicating that K420 is directly involved in the Smad2-TβRI interaction. R427A/R428A have twofold lower affinity for the GS peptide than the Smad2 WT, whereas E425K has twofold higher affinity, suggesting the partial involvement of these residues in the peptide binding. In contrast, W422A and Y426A have essentially the same affinity as the WT, showing that these residues, which play a critical role in PI(4,5)P2 binding, are not involved in the peptide binding. Although Smad2 has lower affinity for the L25 peptide than for the GS peptide, mutants show similar trends: i.e., K420A with the lowest affinity, R427A/R428A with slightly lower affinity, E425K with slightly higher affinity, and W422A and Y426A with WT-like affinity (Fig. 3B and Table 1). Taken together, these results suggest that those residues in the PI(4,5)P2-binding pocket (e.g., W422 and Y426) of Smad2 are not involved in TβRI binding, whereas those residues on the nonspecific membrane-binding surface (e.g., K420) are more directly involved in TβRI binding. They also yielded distinct structural variants for further functional studies. Specifically, W422A and Y426A could serve as specific PI(4,5)P2 binding-compromised mutants and K420A as a predominantly TβRI binding-compromised mutant. R427A/R428A could also serve as a PI(4,5)P2 and TβRI binding-compromised mutant, whereas E425K as a PI(4,5)P2 and TβRI binding-enhanced mutant. To check if a partial overlap between the lipid-binding and TβRI-binding interfaces makes the two binding processes mutually exclusive, we performed the peptide-binding measurement in the presence of LUVs. As shown in Figure 3C, the presence of 50 μM POPC/POPS/PI(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) LUVs in the reaction mixture significantly interfered with binding of Smad2 to the GS peptide when assayed by fluorescence anisotropy. This result suggests that although the overlap between the lipid and protein binding sites in the MH2 domain of Smad2 is relatively modest, this partial overlap may not allow coincident binding of Smad2 to PI(4,5)P2 in the PM and the juxtamembrane TβRI region. It is therefore more likely that Smad2 interacts with membrane lipids and TβRI sequentially. Membrane translocation of Smad2 in response to TGF-β stimulation has not been demonstrated presumably due to the transient nature of its membrane residence. It has been reported that Smad2 is mostly located in the cytoplasm of unstimulated mammalian cells (30Liu L. Liu X. Ren X. Tian Y. Chen Z. Xu X. Du Y. Jiang C. Fang Y. Liu Z. Fan B. Zhang Q. Jin G.

We also found that in unstimulated HeLa cells, endogenous Smad2 or exogenously expressed EGFP-Smad2 mostly distributed in the cytoplasm with little prelocalization to the PM (Fig. S1A). Even after TGF-β stimulation, it was still difficult to clearly visualize PM (or EE) localization of endogenous Smad2 or exogenously expressed EGFP-Smad2 by confocal microscopy (Fig. S1B). We thus employed the total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (33Toomre D. Cellular imaging using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy: Theory and instrumentation.Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2012; 2012: 414-424PubMed Google Scholar) that allows more sensitive and quantitative detection of PM translocation of cytosolic proteins. When monitored by the TIRF microscopy, TGF-β-stimulated PM recruitment of EGFP-Smad2 transfected into HeLa cells was clearly visible (Fig. 4A). Quantification of fluorescence intensity signals showed that PM translocation of Smad2 WT peaked at 5 min after TGF-β stimulation and declined rapidly afterward ("
https://openalex.org/W3207821200,"The cognitive approach to psychotherapy aims to change patients' maladaptive schemas, that is, overly negative views on themselves, the world, or the future. To obtain awareness of these views, they record their thought processes in situations that caused pathogenic emotional responses. The schemas underlying such thought records have, thus far, been largely manually identified. Using recent advances in natural language processing, we take this one step further by automatically extracting schemas from thought records. To this end, we asked 320 healthy participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to each complete five thought records consisting of several utterances reflecting cognitive processes. Agreement between two raters on manually scoring the utterances with respect to how much they reflect each schema was substantial (Cohen's κ = 0.79). Natural language processing software pretrained on all English Wikipedia articles from 2014 (GLoVE embeddings) was used to represent words and utterances, which were then mapped to schemas using k-nearest neighbors algorithms, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks. For the more frequently occurring schemas, all algorithms were able to leverage linguistic patterns. For example, the scores assigned to the Competence schema by the algorithms correlated with the manually assigned scores with Spearman correlations ranging between 0.64 and 0.76. For six of the nine schemas, a set of recurrent neural networks trained separately for each of the schemas outperformed the other algorithms. We present our results here as a benchmark solution, since we conducted this research to explore the possibility of automatically processing qualitative mental health data and did not aim to achieve optimal performance with any of the explored models. The dataset of 1600 thought records comprising 5747 utterances is published together with this article for researchers and machine learning enthusiasts to improve upon our outcomes. Based on our promising results, we see further opportunities for using free-text input and subsequent natural language processing in other common therapeutic tools, such as ecological momentary assessments, automated case conceptualizations, and, more generally, as an alternative to mental health scales."
https://openalex.org/W3165565479,"Puerto Ricans and Mexican immigrants are often exposed to multiple types of adversity across their lifetime (e.g., maltreatment, household dysfunction, discrimination) and this exposure can increase the risk for adult mental health problems.The objective of this study was to (a) identify subgroups of individuals exposed to unique combinations of childhood adversity and lifetime discrimination among Puerto Ricans and Mexican immigrants, and (b) compare the prevalence of mental health problems across different risk profiles.We used existing data from the HCHS/SOL Sociocultural Ancillary Study. Participants included Puerto Rican (N = 402) and Mexican adults (N = 1351) born outside but living in the continental U.S.Through latent profile analysis, we selected a three-profile solution for Puerto Ricans: (a) Low Exposure (low on all adversity items; 58% of sample), (b) Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Only (high on ACEs items, average or lower than average on discrimination items; 32%), and (c) Dual Exposure (high on all adversity items; 10%). For Mexicans, we selected a four-profile solution: (a) Low Exposure (52%), (b) ACEs Only (24%), (c) Maltreatment and Discrimination (15%), and (d) Dual Exposure (9%). For Mexicans, we found that the Dual Exposure and the Maltreatment and Discrimination profiles had the highest levels of mental health problems. For Puerto Ricans, the Dual Exposure and ACEs Only profiles had the highest levels of mental health problems, suggesting that Puerto Ricans may be more vulnerable to the effects of childhood adversities as compared to Mexican immigrants. Results from our study indicate that different patterns of adversity exposure are linked to different levels of mental health outcomes, and therefore, may require different intervention dosage. Understanding which groups of individuals are at highest and lowest risk for mental health problems is critical for developing effective, tailored interventions to prevent the negative effects of childhood adversity and discrimination for Latinxs."
https://openalex.org/W3205229538,"The prevalence of stunting in under five children is high in Mauritania. However, there is a paucity of evidence on the extent and the overtime alteration of inequality in stunting. To this end, we did this study to investigate stunting inequality and the change with time using three rounds of Mauritania Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. The evidence is important to inform implementation of equitable nutrition interventions to help narrow inequality in stunting between population groups.World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) was used in the analysis of stunting inequality. Following standard equity analysis methods recommended by the WHO, we performed disaggregated analysis of stunting across five equity stratfiers: Wealth, education, residence, sex and sub-national regions. Then, we summarized stunting inequality through four measures of inequality: Difference, Ratio, Population Attributable Fraction and Population Attributable Risk. The point estimates of stunting were accompanied by 95% confidence intervals to measure the statistical significance of the findings.The national average of childhood stunting in 2007, 2011 and 2015 was 31.3%, 29.7% and 28.2%, respectively. Glaring inequalities in stunting around the five equity stratifiers were observed in all the studied periods. In the most recent survey included in our study (2015), for instance, we recorded substantial wealth (PAF = -33.60; 95% CI: -39.79, -27.42) and education (PAF = -5.60; 95% CI: -9.68, -1.52) related stunting inequalities. Overall, no substantial improvement was documented in wealth and sex related inequality in stunting between 2007 and 2011 while region-based inequality worsened during the same time periods.The burden of stunting appeared to be heavily concentrated among children born to socioeconomically worse-off women, women who live in rural settings and certain subnational regions. Targeted nutrition interventions are required to address drivers of stunting embedded within geographic and socioeconomic contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3205486917,"The effect of the different training regimes and histories on the spatiotemporal characteristics of human running was evaluated in four groups of subjects who had different histories of engagement in running-specific training; sprinters, distance runners, active athletes, and sedentary individuals. Subjects ran at a variety of velocities, ranging from slowest to fastest, over 30 trials in a random order. Group averages of maximal running velocities, ranked from fastest to slowest, were: sprinters, distance runners, active athletes, and sedentary individuals. The velocity-cadence-step length (V-C-S) relationship, made by plotting step length against cadence at each velocity tested, was analyzed with the segmented regression method, utilizing two regression lines. In all subject groups, there was a critical velocity, defined as the inflection point, in the relationship. In the velocity ranges below and above the inflection point (slower and faster velocity ranges), velocity was modulated primarily by altering step length and by altering cadence, respectively. This pattern was commonly observed in all four groups, not only in sprinters and distance runners, as has already been reported, but also in active athletes and sedentary individuals. This pattern may reflect an energy saving strategy. When the data from all groups were combined, there were significant correlations between maximal running velocity and both running velocity and step length at the inflection point. In spite of the wide variety of athletic experience of the subjects, as well as their maximum running velocities, the inflection point appeared at a similar cadence (3.0 ± 0.2 steps/s) and at a similar relative velocity (65-70%Vmax). These results imply that the influence of running-specific training on the inflection point is minimal."
https://openalex.org/W3206696963,"The World Health Organization Call to Eliminate Cervical Cancer resonates in cities like Manaus, Brazil, where the burden is among the world's highest. Manaus has offered free cytology-based screening since 1990 and HPV immunization since 2013, but the public system is constrained by many challenges and performance is not well-defined. We obtained cervical cancer prevention activities within Manaus public health records for 2019 to evaluate immunization and screening coverage, screening by region and neighborhood, and the annual Pink October screening campaign. We estimated that among girls and boys age 14-18, 85.9% and 64.9% had 1+ doses of HPV vaccine, higher than rates for age 9-13 (73.4% and 43.3%, respectively). Of the 90,209 cytology tests performed, 24.9% were outside the target age and the remaining 72,230 corresponded to 40.1% of the target population (one-third of women age 25-64). The East zone had highest screening coverage (49.1%), highest high-grade cytology rate (2.5%) and lowest estimated cancers (38.1/100,000) compared with the South zone (32.9%, 1.8% and 48.5/100,000, respectively). Largest neighborhoods had fewer per capita screening locations, resulting in lower coverage. During October, some clinics successfully achieved higher screening volumes and high-grade cytology rates (up to 15.4%). Although we found evidence of some follow-up within 10 months post-screening for 51/70 women (72.9%) with high-grade or worse cytology, only 18 had complete work-up confirmed. Manaus has successfully initiated HPV vaccination, forecasting substantial cervical cancer reductions by 2050. With concerted efforts during campaigns, some clinics improved screening coverage and reached high-risk women. Screening campaigns in community locations in high-risk neighborhoods using self-collected HPV testing can achieve widespread coverage. Simplifying triage and treatment with fewer visits closer to communities would greatly improve follow-up and program effectiveness. Achieving WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination goals in high-burden cities will require major reforms for screening and simpler follow-up and treatment."

As they accept bulky and hydrophobic substrates, cutinases could be used in many applications, ranging from valorization of bark-rich side streams to plastic recycling.

Cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) are small serine esterases (20–25 kDa) that show hydrolytic, esterification, and transesterification activity on hydrophobic compounds (1Chen S. Su L. Chen J. Wu J. Cutinase: Characteristics, preparation, and application.Biotechnol. Adv. 2013; 31: 1754-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). They belong to the α/β hydrolase superfamily, and similar to lipases they possess a Ser–His–Asp catalytic triad and an oxyanion hole for transition state stabilization of the substrate. Unlike lipases, cutinases have the catalytic triad located in a shallow binding cleft, exposed to the solvent and thus can act on hydrophobic, high-molecular-weight molecules without the need for surface activation (1Chen S.

The biopolymers cutin and suberin.Arabidopsis Book. 2002; 1e0021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These polyesters are made from long fatty acid chains, C16-C18 for cutin and C16-C34 for suberin, which form links to each other and to a polyaromatic, lignin-like domain, via glycerol or ferulic acid head groups (4Kolattukudy P.E.

Together, these polymers create a complex three-dimensional network with important functions for the plant such as management of water-, solute-, and gas translocation as well as providing physical strength and resistance to pathogenic attack (6Ranathunge K. Schreiber L. Franke R. Suberin research in the genomics era—new interest for an old polymer.Plant Sci. 2011; 180: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).

The biopolymers cutin and suberin.Arabidopsis Book. 2002; 1e0021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These traits make plant-cuticle derived fatty acids interesting polymer precursors for fine chemical applications that have the potential to replace conventional, petrochemical compounds (7Ferreira R.

More significant, however, is their ability to hydrolyze ester bonds of bulky and/or hydrophobic polymers. Their ability to act on man-made polymers, such as the aromatic plastic PET (polyethylene terephthalate) or the aliphatic plastic PLA (polylactic acid), holds promise to make cutinases key tools in plastic degradation, recycling, and upgrading (1Chen S.

Moreover, cutinases could be applied on their natural substrates to release cutin- and suberin-derived fatty acids from plant cuticles, such as the bark and root of trees. Releasing such fatty acids could add a high-value product to conventional forest-based biorefinery processes, facilitating their economic feasibility. The biodiversity of organisms encoding cutinases is vast. Within the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes database (CAZy, www.cazy.org, (11Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 42: D490-D495Crossref PubMed Scopus (3786) Google Scholar)), cutinases are found in Carbohydrate Esterase family 5 (CE5), which today contains over 3000 entries. Enzymes have been described to originate chiefly from bacteria and eukaryotes (mainly fungi), with candidates of both origins being able to act on cutin, suberin, or both (1Chen S. Su L. Chen J.

The CE5 family additionally contains enzymes with acetyl xylan esterase activity (EC 3.1.1.72). Cutinases not enlisted in the CE5 family have also been described, where dedicated PETases, e.g., from Ideonella sakaiensis, are the most prominent ones (12Yoshida S. Hiraga K. Taniguchi I. Oda K.

Here, we solely focused on cutinases that are active on plant biomass, belonging to the CE5 family. The sequence identity between cutinases has been reported to be quite low (1Chen S. Su L. Chen J.

The corresponding broad diversity in structure–function relationships could be exploited to identify suitable cutinase candidates for a specific application (10Nyyssölä A. Which properties of cutinases are important for applications?.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2015; 99: 4931-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, previous studies only looked at a few sequences (1Chen S. Su L. Chen J. Wu J. Cutinase: Characteristics, preparation, and application.Biotechnol. Adv. 2013; 31: 1754-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13Skamnioti P. Furlong R.F. Gurr S.J.

As of July 2021, only nine solved crystal structures of CE5 cutinases have been reported, and as we demonstrate in this study, most of them are phylogenetically close. Further, using the most common model substrate, para-nitrophenol (pNP) esterified with fatty acids of increasing chain length (pNP-Cn) (1Chen S. Su L. Chen J. Wu J. Cutinase: Characteristics, preparation, and application.Biotechnol.

Such detailed information is, however, vital to understand the structure–function relationship of cutinases and hence brings these promising types of enzymes closer to application. In the present study, we explore the biodiversity of CE5 cutinases and provide in-depth information on enzyme kinetics and structure–function relationships of phylogenetically, structurally, and kinetically diverse cutinases. As CE5 is a polyspecific family, we filtered its members to focus on ∼150 putatively active cutinases, which were phylogenetically analyzed. Out of these, nine cutinases from across the phylogenetic tree were selected and recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris, and the differences in sequence were reflected in their individual activities toward pNP-C2 to pNP-C16 substrates as well as in their modeled protein structures. The five candidates with the highest activity on pNP-C16, indicating activity on bulky and hydrophobic substrates, were subjected to in-depth kinetic characterization and structure–function analysis by in silico docking analyzes. Our results shed light on the diversity of CE5 cutinases and have implications for both their utilization and future enzyme discovery efforts. By 2021, over 3000 members are listed in the CAZy database CE5 family. We sorted the listed enzymes in CE5 to condense the family to putative cutinases and subjected the resulting entries to a phylogenetic analysis. Nine enzymes (summarized in Table 1), spanning the phylogenetic tree, were selected for cloning and characterization against pNP-substrate with increasing chain lengths.Table 1Description of cutinases selected for recombinant production and kinetic characterizationProtein idUniprot accessionSource organismReferenceCcCutB9U443Coprinopsis cinereaFungi; Basidiomycete; Filamentous(18Kontkanen H.

Open table in a new tab A scheme was devised to sort CE5 sequences into putative cutinases according to the decision tree depicted in Figure S1. For this, entries were first evaluated toward their likelihood to result in a mature, active enzyme. In a second step, the correlation of either the enzyme or the encoding organism to lignocellulolytic activity was assessed (e.g., plant pathogens), indicating potential suberin- or cutin-degrading activity. The resulting list of genes contained 151 putative cutinases with 41 from bacterial and 110 from fungal organisms, suggesting a predominance of cutinases in fungal lignocellulose degraders. Of the 41 bacterial cutinases, 32 are from the Mycobacterium genus within the Actinobacteria phylum, where species of Mycobacterium spp (16 species) and Mycolicibacter spp (14 species) were most common. The fungal cutinases originated from a broader set of organisms, where ascomycetes were more common than basidiomycetes. Here, the most represented genera are Aspergillus (12 species), Fusarium (26 species), and Pyricularia (15 species). The phylogenetic tree constructed from the 151 cutinase sequences is displayed in Figure 1. The tree revealed nine main clades, or clusters, of which a detailed description is given in Figure S2 (1Chen S. Su L. Chen J. Wu J. Cutinase: Characteristics, preparation, and application.Biotechnol. Adv. 2013; 31: 1754-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence identities between the 151 cutinases analyzed in this study ranged from 8 to 93% (as analyzed with Clustal Omega at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/), proving the vast sequence diversity of this enzyme family. Our results are in line with a previous study (13Skamnioti P. Furlong R.F. Gurr S.J. Evolutionary history of the ancient cutinase family in five filamentous ascomycetes reveals differential gene duplications and losses and in Magnaporthe grisea shows evidence of sub- and neo-functionalization.New Phytol. 2008; 180: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), where analysis of the evolutionary history of cutinases from five ascomycetes revealed “extreme sequence diversity.” Transcript profiling for categorizing regulatory patterns has further suggested that phylogenetically related cutinase genes in Magnaporthe grisea underwent extensive sub- and neo-functionalization (13Skamnioti P. Furlong R.F. Gurr S.J. Evolutionary history of the ancient cutinase family in five filamentous ascomycetes reveals differential gene duplications and losses and in Magnaporthe grisea shows evidence of sub- and neo-functionalization.New Phytol. 2008; 180: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This implies that the genome of a single organism can harbor and differentially express cutinases with low sequence identity and broad functionality, which was likely a chief driver for the niche differentiation of some fungi into plant parasites (6Ranathunge K. Schreiber L. Franke R. Suberin research in the genomics era—new interest for an old polymer.Plant Sci. 2011; 180: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Martins I. Hartmann D.O.

Supporting the proposed physiological function of cutinases, the majority of the fungal cutinases selected in this study are from plant pathogens (Fig. S2). The function of cutinases from the human and animal pathogen Mycobacterium as esterases, in contrast, is likely parallel to that of other enzymes accepting hydrophobic substrates and might contribute to the pathogenicity by degrading the cell membrane of the infected host. Because they lack cutin-degrading activity (24West N.P. Chow F.M.E. Randall E.J. Wu J. Chen J. Ribeiro J.M.C. Britton W.J. Cutinase-like proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Characterization of their variable enzymatic functions and active site identification.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1694-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), they were placed outside the scope of this study. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Mycobacterium cutinases form their own discrete clade clearly apart from enzymes from other clades, which mainly harbor fungal enzymes (Fig. S2, “clade G”). The selected 151 sequences encompass nine solved cutinase crystal structures (Fig. 1), six of which are in one area of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S2, clades A, B, and C). From the analyzed cutinases, the one from Fusarium solani (accession number P00590) is the most studied with 44 resolved structures of the wild-type enzyme and various variants. From the phylogenetic tree, the next step was to identify cutinases from different organisms for recombinant production in P. pastoris, followed by kinetic characterization. Cutinases from diverse sources have been successfully produced in P. pastoris, suggesting it to be a suitable host for these enzymes (14Duan X. Liu Y. You X. Jiang Z. Yang S. Yang S.

https://openalex.org/W3207745481,"To determine whether arytenoid cartilage position and dynamics change with advancing duration and severity (as graded by MDS-UPDRS part III scores) in Parkinson's disease, in a cross-sectional study design, we performed laryngeal four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) in people with Parkinson's disease and controls.31 people with Parkinson's disease covering a range of disease duration and severity and 19 controls underwent laryngeal 4D-CT whilst repeatedly vocalizing. We measured on each CT volume the glottic area (GA), inter-arytenoid distance (IAD), IAD-Area index (IAI) and arytenoid cartilage velocity ([Formula: see text]).People with Parkinson's disease had reductions in the mean/effective minimum IAD when compared to controls, while mean/effective minimum GA and mean/effective maximum IAI were increased. Arytenoid cartilage velocities showed no difference. On Spearman correlation analyses, advancing disease duration and severity of PD showed moderately strong and significant correlations with increasing mean/effective minimum GA, increasing mean/effective maximum IAI and decreasing effective minimum IAD. Linear mixed models which considered the effects of intra and inter-individual variation showed that both disease duration (b = -0.011, SEb = 0.053, 95% CI [-0.022, 0], t(27) = -2.10, p = 0.045) and severity (b = -0.069, SEb = 0.032, 95% CI [-0.14,-0.0039], t(27) = -2.17, p = 0.039) were significant predictors for IAD, and also for transformed values of the GA and IAI.There are progressive alterations in phonatory posturing as Parkinson's disease advances. The increases in GA despite reductions in IAD are concordant with prior observations of vocal fold bowing. Our study provides a basis for using laryngeal 4D-CT to assess disease progression in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W3207963970,"Phoneme pronunciations are usually considered as basic skills for learning a foreign language. Practicing the pronunciations in a computer-assisted way is helpful in a self-directed or long-distance learning environment. Recent researches indicate that machine learning is a promising method to build high-performance computer-assisted pronunciation training modalities. Many data-driven classifying models, such as support vector machines, back-propagation networks, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks, are increasingly widely used for it. Yet, the acoustic waveforms of phoneme are essentially modulated from the base vibrations of vocal cords, and this fact somehow makes the predictors collinear, distorting the classifying models. A commonly-used solution to address this issue is to suppressing the collinearity of predictors via partial least square regressing algorithm. It allows to obtain high-quality predictor weighting results via predictor relationship analysis. However, as a linear regressor, the classifiers of this type possess very simple topology structures, constraining the universality of the regressors. For this issue, this paper presents an heterogeneous phoneme recognition framework which can further benefit the phoneme pronunciation diagnostic tasks by combining the partial least square with support vector machines. A French phoneme data set containing 4830 samples is established for the evaluation experiments. The experiments of this paper demonstrates that the new method improves the accuracy performance of the phoneme classifiers by 0.21 - 8.47% comparing to state-of-the-arts with different data training data density."
https://openalex.org/W3205156360,"Disease surveillance and response are critical components of epidemic preparedness. The disease response, in most cases, is a set of reactive measures that follow the outcomes of the disease surveillance. Hence, timely surveillance is a prerequisite for an effective response.We apply epidemiological soundness criteria in combination with the Latent Influence Point Process and time-to-event models to construct a disease spread network. The network implicitly quantifies the fertility (whether a case leads to secondary cases) and reproduction (number of secondary cases per infectious case) of the cases as well as the size and generations (of the infection chain) of the outbreaks. We test our approach by applying it to historic dengue case data from Australia. Using the data, we empirically confirm that high morbidity relates positively with delay in disease response. Moreover, we identify what constitutes timely surveillance by applying various thresholds of disease response delay to the network and report their impact on case fertility, reproduction, number of generations and ultimately, outbreak size. We observe that enforcing a response delay threshold of 5 days leads to a large average reduction across all parameters (occurrence 87%, reproduction 83%, outbreak size 80% and outbreak generations 47%), whereas extending the threshold to 10 days, in comparison, significantly limits the effectiveness of the response actions. Lastly, we identify the components of the disease surveillance system that can be calibrated to achieve the identified thresholds.We identify practically achievable, timely surveillance thresholds (on temporal scale) that lead to an effective response and identify how they can be satisfied. Our approach can be utilized to provide guidelines on spatially and demographically targeted resource allocation for public awareness campaigns as well as to improve diagnostic abilities and turn-around times for the doctors and laboratories involved."
https://openalex.org/W3207424871,"To make valid comparisons across groups, a measurement instrument needs to be measurement invariant across those groups. The present study evaluates measurement invariance for experience of violence among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in two informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya.We used survey data collected from 1,081 AGYW aged 15-22 years from two Nairobi's informal settlements of Korogocho (n = 617) and Viwandani (n = 464) in 2017 through DREAMS (an initiative aimed at reducing HIV incidence among AGYW with a core package of evidence-based interventions) impact evaluation project. Experience of violence was measured using the 15-item WHO's violence against women instrument, and factorial (non)invariance assessed within exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) framework. Cross-group measurement invariance was assessed using Bayesian Multiple Indicator Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model across site, age groups, self-reported invitation to participate in DREAMS, marital status, currently in school, education level, religion, ethnic groups, ever had sex, slept hungry at night past 4 weeks, and wealth index.The mean and median ages of the AGYW were 17.9 years and 17 years, respectively. About 59% reported having had sex and 58% of AGYW were in school. The percentage reporting each act of violence varied from 1.6% (""attacked you with a weapon"") to 26.5% (""insult you or make you feel bad about yourself""). About 44% (n = 474) of participants experienced ≥1 acts of violence, and 2.7% (n = 29) experienced at least half of the 15 acts. The structure underlying the 15 items was configurally similar to that proposed by WHO, with three factors reflecting either psychological, physical, or sexual violence. Noninvariance was detected for five items-spread across the three domains. Three of five items showed noninvariance only for sleeping hungry at night in the past 4 weeks. As the majority of items did not show evidence of noninvariance, differences in latent mean scores likely reflect actual differences and may not be attributable to measurement artifacts.Using state-of-the-art statistical techniques on a widely used instrument for measuring exposure to violence among women, this study provides support for the subscales of psychological, physical and sexual violence in a Kenyan AGYW population. The instrument supports comparisons across groups within this population. This is crucial when comparing violence against girls/women prevalence rates and to understand challenges and exchange strategies to reduce abuse or violence experienced by AGYW, or women in general."
https://openalex.org/W3207793510,"Lung cancer is the major cause of mortality in tumor patients. While its incidence rate has recently declined, it is still far from satisfactory and its potential modifiable risk factors should be explored.We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the causal relationship between potentially modifiable risk factors (namely smoking behavior, alcohol intake, anthropometric traits, blood pressure, lipidemic traits, glycemic traits, and fasting insulin) and lung cancer. Besides, a bi-directional MR analysis was carried out to disentangle the complex relationship between different risk factors. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was utilized to combine the estimation for each SNP. Cochrane's Q value was used to evaluate heterogeneity and two methods, including MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO, were adopted to detect horizontal pleiotropy.Three kinds of smoking behavior were all causally associated with lung cancer. Overall, smokers were more likely to suffer from lung cancer compared with non-smokers (OR = 2.58 [1.95, 3.40], p-value = 2.07 x 10-11), and quitting smoking could reduce the risk (OR = 4.29[2.60, 7.07], p-value = 1.23 x 10-8). Furthermore, we found a dose-response relationship between the number of cigarettes and lung cancer (OR = 6.10 [5.35, 6.96], p-value = 4.43x10-161). Lower HDL cholesterol could marginally increase the risk of lung cancer, but become insignificant after Bonferroni correction (OR = 0.82 [0.68, 1.00], p-value = 0.045). In addition, we noted no direct causal relationship between other risk factors and lung cancer. Neither heterogeneity nor pleiotropy was observed in this study. However, when treating the smoking behavior as the outcome, we found the increased BMI could elevate the number of cigarettes per day (beta = 0.139[0.104, 0.175], p-value = 1.99x10-14) and a similar effect was observed for the waist circumference and hip circumference. Additionally, the elevation of SBP could also marginally increase the number of cigarettes per day (beta = 0.001 [0.0002, 0.002], p-value = 0.018).Smoking behavior might be the most direct and effective modifiable way to reduce the risk of lung cancer. Meanwhile, smoking behavior can be affected by other risk factors, especially obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3205053796,"The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of remdesivir for coronavirus disease 2019 raised questions on transparency of applied strategy, and how to equitably allocate and prioritize eligible patients given limited supply of the medication. The absence of federal oversight highlighted the critical role by states in health policymaking during a pandemic.To identify public state-based protocols for remdesivir allocation and clinical guidance for prioritizing remdesivir use and assess approaches and inclusion of language promoting equitable access or mitigating health disparities.We identified remdesivir allocation strategies and clinical use guidelines for all 50 states in the U.S. and the District of Columbia accessible on state health department websites or via internet searches. Public protocols dated between May 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 were included in the study. We reviewed strategies for allocation and clinical use, including whether protocols contained explicit language on equitable access to remdesivir or mitigating health disparities.A total of 38 states had a remdesivir allocation strategy, with 33 states (87%) making these public. States used diverse allocation strategies, and only 10 (30%) of the 33 states included language on equitable allocation. A total of 30 states had remdesivir clinical use guidelines, where all were publicly accessible. All guidelines referenced recommendations by federal agencies but varied in their presentation format. Of the 30 states, 12 (40%) had guidelines that included language on equitable use. Neither an allocation strategy or clinical use guideline were identified (public or non-public) for 10 states and the District of Columbia during the study period.The experience with the remdesivir EUA presents an opportunity for federal and state governments to develop transparent protocols promoting fair and equal access to treatments for future pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W3205640540,"CEACAM1-LF, a homotypic cell adhesion adhesion molecule, transduces intracellular signals via a 72 amino acid cytoplasmic domain that contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and a binding site for β-catenin. Phosphorylation of Ser503 by PKC in rodent CEACAM1 was shown to affect bile acid transport or hepatosteatosis via the level of ITIM phosphorylation, but the phosphorylation of the equivalent residue in human CEACAM1 (Ser508) was unclear. Here we studied this analogous phosphorylation by NMR analysis of the 15N labeled cytoplasmic domain peptide. Incubation with a variety of Ser/Thr kinases revealed phosphorylation of Ser508 by GSK3bβ but not by PKC. The lack of phosphorylation by PKC is likely due to evolutionary sequence changes between the rodent and human genes. Phosphorylation site assignment by mass spectrometry and NMR revealed phosphorylation of Ser472, Ser461 and Ser512 by PKA, of which Ser512 is part of a conserved consensus site for GSK3β binding. We showed here that only after phosphorylation of Ser512 by PKA was GSK3β able to phosphorylate Ser508. Phosphorylation of Ser512 by PKA promoted a tight association with the armadillo repeat domain of β-catenin at an extended region spanning the ITIMs of CEACAM1. The kinetics of phosphorylation of the ITIMs by Src, as well dephosphorylation by SHP2, were affected by the presence of Ser508/512 phosphorylation, suggesting that PKA and GSK3β may regulate the signal transduction activity of human CEACAM1-LF. The interaction of CEACAM1-LF with β-catenin promoted by PKA is suggestive of a tight association between the two ITIMs of CEACAM1-LF."
https://openalex.org/W3205660412,"The microtubule-binding protein tau has been the center of researches concerning Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to several clinical trials of β-amyloid therapies failing recently. The availability of the tau fibril structure from AD brain enables computational modeling studies to calculate binding affinities with different ligands. In this study, the tau paired helical filaments (PHF-Tau) (PDB ID: 5O3L) was used as receptor and interactions with the lipids: 3-alpha-cholesterol; 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; and C18:1 sphingomyelin, were explored with molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and natural bond orbital analysis. Docking sites upon solvation of the protein with transferable interatomic potential-3 points reveal the amphipathic nature of PHF-Tau and molecular dynamics simulations show that the embedded phosphocholine at the tail side gives high potential energy values with some amino acids forming H-bond interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3205696100,"The endocervix, the primary site of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infection in women, has a unique repertoire of locally synthesized IgG and secretory IgA (SIgA) with contributions from serum IgG. Here, we assessed the ability of genital and serum-derived IgG and IgA from women with a recent positive Ct test to neutralize Ct elementary bodies (EBs) and inhibit inclusion formation in vitro in human endocervical epithelial cells. We also determined if neutralization was influenced by the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of the infecting strain, as indicated by ompA gene sequencing and genotyping. At equivalent low concentrations of Ct EB (D/UW-3/Cx + E/UW-5/Cx)-specific antibody, genital-derived IgG and IgA and serum IgA, but not serum IgG, significantly inhibited inclusion formation, with genital IgA being most effective, followed by genital IgG, then serum IgA. The well-characterized Ct genotype D strain, D/UW-3/Cx, was neutralized by serum-derived IgG from patients infected with genotype D strains, genital IgG from patients infected with genotype D or E strains, and by genital IgA from patients infected with genotype D, E, or F strains. Additionally, inhibition of D/UW-3/Cx infection by whole serum, rather than purified immunoglobulin, was associated with levels of serum EB-specific IgG rather than the genotype of infecting strain. In contrast, a Ct genotype Ia clinical isolate, Ia/LSU-56/Cx, was neutralized by whole serum in a genotype and genogroup-specific manner, and inhibition also correlated with EB-specific IgG concentrations in serum. Taken together, these data suggest that (i) genital IgA most effectively inhibits Ct infection in vitro, (ii) human antibody-mediated inhibition of Ct infection is significantly influenced by the ompA genotype of the infecting strain, (iii) the genital antibody repertoire develops or matures differently compared to systemic antibody, and (iv) ompA genotype-specificity of inhibition of infection by whole serum can be overcome by high concentrations of Ct-specific IgG."
https://openalex.org/W3206048199,"A query optimizer attempts to predict a performance metric based on the amount of time elapsed. Theoretically, this would necessitate the creation of a significant overhead on the core engine to provide the necessary query optimizing statistics. Machine learning is increasingly being used to improve query performance by incorporating regression models. To predict the response time for a query, most query performance approaches rely on DBMS optimizing statistics and the cost estimation of each operator in the query execution plan, which also focuses on resource utilization (CPU, I/O). Modeling query features is thus a critical step in developing a robust query performance prediction model. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on query feature modeling and ensemble learning to predict query performance and use this framework as a query performance predictor simulator to optimize the query features that influence query performance. In query feature modeling, we propose five dimensions used to model query features. The query features dimensions are syntax, hardware, software, data architecture, and historical performance logs. These features will be based on developing training datasets for the performance prediction model that employs the ensemble learning model. As a result, ensemble learning leverages the query performance prediction problem to deal with missing values. Handling overfitting via regularization. The section on experimental work will go over how to use the proposed framework in experimental work. The training dataset in this paper is made up of performance data logs from various real-world environments. The outcomes were compared to show the difference between the actual and expected performance of the proposed prediction model. Empirical work shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to related work."
https://openalex.org/W3207578701,"Objectives The impact of the quality of discharge communication between physicians and their patients is critical on patients’ health outcomes. Nevertheless, low recall of information given to patients at discharge from emergency departments (EDs) is a well-documented problem. Therefore, we investigated the outcomes and related benefits of two different communication strategies: Physicians were instructed to either use empathy (E) or information structuring (S) skills hypothesizing superior recall by patients in the S group. Methods For the direct comparison of two communication strategies at discharge, physicians were cluster-randomized to an E or a S skills training. Feasibility was measured by training completion rates. Outcomes were measured in patients immediately after discharge, after 7, and 30 days. Primary outcome was patients’ immediate recall of discharge information. Secondary outcomes were feasibility of training implementation, patients’ adherence to recommendations and satisfaction, as well as the patient-physician relationship. Results Of 117 eligible physicians, 80 (68.4%) completed the training. Out of 256 patients randomized to one of the two training groups (E: 146 and S: 119) 196 completed the post-discharge assessment. Patients’ immediate recall of discharge information was superior in patients in the S-group vs. E-group. Patients in the S-group adhered to more recommendations within 30 days ( p = .002), and were more likely to recommend the physician to family and friends (p = .021). No differences were found on other assessed outcome domains. Conclusions and practice Implications Immediate recall and subsequent adherence to recommendations were higher in the S group. Feasibility was shown by a 69.6% completion rate of trainings. Thus, trainings of discharge information structuring are feasible and improve patients’ recall, and may therefore improve quality of care in the ED."
https://openalex.org/W3205244483,"In many eukaryotes, multiple protein kinases are situated in the plasma membrane where they respond to extracellular ligands. Ligand binding elicits a signal that is transmitted across the membrane, leading to activation of the cytosolic kinase domain. Humans have over 100 receptor protein kinases. In contrast, our search of the Trypanosoma brucei kinome showed that there were only ten protein kinases with predicted transmembrane domains, and unlike other eukaryotic transmembrane kinases, seven are predicted to bear multiple transmembrane domains. Most of the ten kinases, including their transmembrane domains, are conserved in both Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania species. Several possess accessory domains, such as Kelch, nucleotide cyclase, and forkhead-associated domains. Surprisingly, two contain multiple regions with predicted structural similarity to domains in bacterial signaling proteins. A few of the protein kinases have previously been localized to subcellular structures such as endosomes or lipid bodies. We examined the localization of epitope-tagged versions of seven of the predicted transmembrane kinases in T. brucei bloodstream forms and show that five localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. The last two kinases are enzymatically active, integral membrane proteins associated with the flagellum, flagellar pocket, or adjacent structures as shown by both fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Thus, these kinases are positioned in structures suggesting participation in signal transduction from the external environment."
https://openalex.org/W3205278153,"The aim of the study was to conduct a first validation of three field practice experience scales intended to measure students' opportunities to learn through observation of other teachers, own practice and feedback on own practice of 12 key teaching activities while in field practice placement as part of teacher education programs. The scales were translated and adapted from the elementary teaching candidate survey from the Development of Ambitious Instruction project. Items were adapted to refer to the teaching subject students were training in, and the response scale was modified. A four-step translation-back-translation strategy was used, and subsequently the Danish and a Norwegian and Icelandic translations were mutually adjusted for meaning to facilitate later cross-Nordic studies. Participants were 345 Danish students in the teacher education program from one university college, who had been in at least one field practice placement. Data were collected using a targeted online survey during one month immediately following field placement. Data was analysed using the Rasch model. Each of the three field experience scales fitted a Rasch model, with no evidence against overall homogeneity of scores for low versus high scoring students, local dependence between items, or DIF in relation to level of field practice, campus, type of teacher education program, gender or age. Reliability of each scale was excellent for most subgroups, while the targeting of the scales to the study sample was not very good, as there were too few teaching activities occurring rarely during field practice (i.e. too few difficult items). For all three scales there were significant differences in mean scores dependent on level of field practice placement. Thus, while the scales should be expanded to get better coverage of students' opportunities to learn in relation to all the core teaching activities present in that are to be trained in the field practice placement, the very good psychometric properties of the three scales, shows promise for future research."
https://openalex.org/W3206295468,"Body mass index (BMI) is a highly heritable polygenic trait. It is also affected by various environmental and behavioral risk factors. We used a BMI polygenic risk score (PRS) to study the interplay between the genetic and environmental factors defining BMI. First, we generated a BMI PRS that explained more variance than a BMI genetic risk score (GRS), which was using only genome-wide significant BMI-associated variants (R2 = 13.1% compared to 6.1%). Second, we analyzed interactions between BMI PRS and seven environmental factors. We found a significant interaction between physical activity and BMI PRS, even when the well-known effect of the FTO region was excluded from the PRS, using a small dataset of 6,179 samples. Third, we stratified the study population into two risk groups using BMI PRS. The top 22% of the studied populations were included in a high PRS risk group. Engagement in self-reported physical activity was associated with a 1.66 kg/m2 decrease in BMI in this group, compared to a 0.84 kg/m2 decrease in BMI in the rest of the population. Our results (i) confirm that genetic background strongly affects adult BMI in the general population, (ii) show a non-linear interaction between BMI genetics and physical activity, and (iii) provide a standardized framework for future gene-environment interaction analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3207213584,"Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a newly discovered posttranslational modification (PTM), which has been studied at the proteomics level in a few species, with the study of Kcr in female fertility and in insect species is still lacking. Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) is a well-known beneficial insect used as a natural biological control agent against aphids in agriculture. Here, global Kcr identification in ovarian tissue of H. axyridis at diapause stage was performed to reveal potential roles for Kcr in H. axyridis ovarian cellular processes, female fertility and diapause regulation. In total, 3084 Kcr sites in 920 proteins were identified. Bioinformatic analyses revealed the distribution of these proteins in multiple subcellular localization categories and their involvement in diverse biological processes and metabolism pathways. Carbohydrate and energy metabolism related cellular processes including citric acid cycle, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation appeared be affected by Kcr modification. In addition, regulation of translation and protein biosynthesis may reflect Kcr involvement in diapause in H. axyridis, with Kcr affecting ribosome activities and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, Kcr modulation H. axyridis ovary development regulation may share some common mechanism with Kcr participation in some disease progression. These processes and pathways were uncovered under diapause stage, but possibly not enriched/specific for diapause stage due to limitations of qualitative proteomics experimental design. Our results informs on the potential for Kcr modifications to regulate female fertility and insect physiology."
