https://openalex.org/W2014093920,"The gene product of the ob locus is important in the regulation of body weight. The ob product was shown to be present as a 16-kilodalton protein in mouse and human plasma but was undetectable in plasma from C57BL/6J ob/ob mice. Plasma levels of this protein were increased in diabetic (db) mice, a mutant thought to be resistant to the effects of ob. Daily intraperitoneal injections of either mouse or human recombinant OB protein reduced the body weight of ob/ob mice by 30 percent after 2 weeks of treatment with no apparent toxicity but had no effect on db/db mice. The protein reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure in ob/ob mice. Injections of wild-type mice twice daily with the mouse protein resulted in a sustained 12 percent weight loss, decreased food intake, and a reduction of body fat from 12.2 to 0.7 percent. These data suggest that the OB protein serves an endocrine function to regulate body fat stores."
https://openalex.org/W2060682066,"C57BL/6J mice with a mutation in the obese (ob) gene are obese, diabetic, and exhibit reduced activity, metabolism, and body temperature. Daily intraperitoneal injection of these mice with recombinant OB protein lowered their body weight, percent body fat, food intake, and serum concentrations of glucose and insulin. In addition, metabolic rate, body temperature, and activity levels were increased by this treatment. None of these parameters was altered beyond the level observed in lean controls, suggesting that the OB protein normalized the metabolic status of the ob/ob mice. Lean animals injected with OB protein maintained a smaller weight loss throughout the 28-day study and showed no changes in any of the metabolic parameters. These data suggest that the OB protein regulates body weight and fat deposition through effects on metabolism and appetite."
https://openalex.org/W2013583119,The recent positional cloning of the mouse ob gene and its human homology has provided the basis to investigate the potential role of the ob gene product in body weight regulation. A biologically active form of recombinant mouse OB protein was overexpressed and purified to near homogeneity from a bacterial expression system. Peripheral and central administration of microgram doses of OB protein reduced food intake and body weight of ob/ob and diet-induced obese mice but not in db/db obese mice. The behavioral effects after brain administration suggest that OB protein can act directly on neuronal networks that control feeding and energy balance.
https://openalex.org/W1971453983,"The role of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades in integrating distinct upstream signals was studied in yeast. Mutants that were not able to activate PBS2 MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK; Pbs2p) at high osmolarity were characterized. Pbs2p was activated by two independent signals that emanated from distinct cell-surface osmosensors. Pbs2p was activated by MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) Ssk2p and Ssk22p that are under the control of the SLN1-SSK1 two-component osmosensor. Alternatively, Pbs2p was activated by a mechanism that involves the binding of its amino terminal proline-rich motif to the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of a putative transmembrane osmosensor Sho1p."
https://openalex.org/W2010003461,"Whether neurons express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes has not been firmly established. The techniques of confocal laser microscopy, patch clamp electrophysiology, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were combined here to directly examine the inducibility of MHC class I genes in individual cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Transcription of MHC class I genes was very rare in neurons with spontaneous action potentials. In electrically silent neurons, transcription was noted, with expression of beta 2-microglobulin under tighter control than in class I heavy chain molecules. Surface expression of class I molecules occurred only in electrically silent neurons treated with interferon gamma. Immunosurveillance by cytotoxic T cells may be focused on functionally impaired neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1625553880,"The vacuolar H+-ATPase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of a complex of peripheral subunits (the V1 sector) attached to an integral membrane complex (the V0 sector). In the experiments described here, attachment of the V1 to the V0 sector was assessed in wild-type cells under a variety of growth conditions. Depriving the yeast cells of glucose, even for as little as 5 min, caused dissociation of approximately 70% of the assembled enzyme complexes into separate V1 and V0 subcomplexes. Restoration of glucose induced rapid and efficient reassembly of the enzyme from the previously synthesized subcomplexes. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation revealed detachment of the peripheral subunits from the vacuolar membrane in the absence of glucose, followed by reattachment in the presence of glucose. Rapid dissociation of vacuolar H+-ATPases could also be triggered by shifting cells into a variety of other carbon sources, and reassembly could be generated by addition of glucose.

All consist of a V1 sector, which is a complex of peripheral membrane proteins containing the ATP-binding sites, and a V0 sector, comprising a complex of integral membrane proteins containing the proton pore(2Sze H.

The vacuolar H+-ATPases share sequence and structural similarities with the F1F0-ATPases of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria, and these similarities are believed to reflect an evolutionary relationship(5Nelson N.

However, unlike the F1F0-ATPases, which can be separated into a soluble F1 complex that is capable of ATP hydrolysis(6Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 64: 173-214Google Scholar), and a membrane-bound F0 complex that appears to function as a proton channel(7Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Schonknecht G. Junge W. Eur. J.

Studies of the assembly of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase have shown that mutants lacking one subunit of the enzyme complex can still assemble the V1 complex in the cytoplasm under conditions where the V0 complex is not assembled, and the V0 complex can be assembled and transported to the vacuole in the absence of an assembled V1 complex(14Doherty R.D.

Independent V1 and V0 complexes were also seen in wild-type yeast cells, but it was not clear whether these complexes were assembly intermediates, products of breakdown of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, or artifacts of the biochemical isolation(14Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This paper describes the reversible dissociation of the wild-type V1 complex from the V0 complex in vivo. Both the disassembly and subsequent reassembly of the complex occur rapidly and efficiently in response to changes in growth conditions, suggesting that these processes could play a role in regulation of vacuolar H+-ATPase activity or in cellular distribution of the active enzyme. Zymolyase 100T was purchased from Seikagaku America, Inc. Tran35S-label was purchased from ICN. Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) was obtained from Pierce. 14C-Labeled molecular mass markers (high range) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All secondary antibodies used for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (fluorescein-conjugated and unconjugated) were obtained from Organon Teknika-Cappel. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The wild-type yeast strain SF838-1D (genotype: MATα, ade6, leu2-3, leu2-112, ura3-52, pep4-3, gal2) was used in all experiments. Yeast media were prepared as described previously(18Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 177-186Google Scholar, 19Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.W. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Cells were converted to spheroplasts in supplemented minimal medium lacking methionine that contained 2% glucose and 1.2 M sorbitol (SD-Met, 1.2 M sorbitol) by incubation for 20 min with 0.1 unit of zymolyase/107 cells. For each immunoprecipitation, 0.5 × 107 spheroplasts were suspended in 150 μl of SD-Met, 1.2 M sorbitol, shaken 20 min at 30°C, and then incubated for the indicated labeling time with 50 μCi of Tran35S-label. At the end of the incubation, unlabeled methionine and cysteine were added to a final concentration of 0.33 mg/ml each, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation. For samples with a subsequent chase, the pellets were resuspended in the appropriate medium to the same density as for labeling and shaken at 30°C for varied times. After the labeling and chase times were completed, spheroplast pellets were solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 12 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) containing 1% (w/v) C12E9 and a protease inhibitor mixture (final concentrations: 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). DSP was added as 25 mM solution in dimethyl sulfoxide, to a final concentration of 0.67 mM. After 60 min, an equal volume of quenching buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA) containing a 2-fold concentration of the protease inhibitor mixture was added to the samples to quench the cross-linker, and after another 15 min, samples were presorbed with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, as described. Antibody incubations were carried out as described(14Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 5 μl (12.5 μg) of purified 8B1 antibody (9Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 495 μl of PBS containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were added instead of a cultured supernatant containing this antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed, solubilized, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described(14Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases immunoprecipitation results were quantitated by exposing the gels overnight to the phosphor-containing screen and analyzing on a Fuji BAS100 phosphorimager. In the experiment shown in Table II, yeast cells were grown overnight, converted to spheroplasts, and labeled with Tran35S-label as described above except that 2% raffinose was used as the sole carbon source instead of 2% glucose. Unlabeled methionine and cysteine were added to initiate the chase period, but raffinose (to give a total concentration of 4%) and glucose (to give a final concentration of 2%) were then added directly to the labeling medium rather than spinning down the spheroplasts and resuspending them in fresh medium.Table II:Glucose induces assembly of V1V0 complexes in cells grown in raffinose Open table in a new tab In the absence of the DSP cross-linker, a similar collection of subunits, with the exception of the 42-kDa subunit, could be immunoprecipitated from wild-type cells by the 8B1 antibody. The 42-kDa subunit appeared to be lost during immunoprecipitation without cross-linker even though it could be isolated with the complex by other means(14Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of cross-linker allowed consistent immunoprecipitation of the 42-kDa subunit with the wild-type complex and allowed more reliable comparisons between different experiments. In the presence of DSP, several proteins in addition to the 100-, 36-, and 17-kDa subunits of the ATPase are co-precipitated consistently by the 10D7 antibody. These included a band at 75 kDa and a faint, diffuse band at 19 kDa that were co-precipitated previously in the absence of cross-linker(14Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as a band at 200 kDa and several at 40-60 kDa. Precipitation of these bands was characteristic of the 10D7 antibody, but the amount of protein in additional bands did not appear to change under conditions for disassembly and reassembly as the 100-, 36-, and 17-kDa proteins did. Cells were grown to mid-log phase in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose medium; Ref. 18), then diluted to approximately 1 × 107 cells/ml in YEPD or YEP (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone medium without dextrose) and incubated at 30°C. After the indicated time of incubation, cells were fixed for 30 min in the same medium, then pelleted and fixed overnight(20Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 13D11 and 10D7 (15) were used at a 1:10 dilution and undiluted, respectively, and the signal was amplified as described(20Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Cells grown overnight at 30°C to early to mid-log phase in YEPD, YEP containing 2% raffinose, or YEP containing 3% glycerol, 2% ethanol were converted to spheroplasts and washed as described above, except that all incubations were carried out in the presence of the appropriate carbon source. Spheroplasts from approximately 2.5 × 107 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of the appropriate incubation medium containing 1.2 M sorbitol and incubated for 20 min at 30°C. In some samples the incubation was continued for another 20 min in the presence of added 2% glucose to assess reassembly; otherwise, the cells were pelleted after the initial 20-min incubation then resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing the same protease inhibitor mixture used for immunoprecipitations. DSP was added to a final concentration of 0.6 mM, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 60 min. The cross-linker was quenched by addition of 1 ml of quenching buffer, followed by incubation for 20 min on ice. After addition of another 3 ml of PBS containing the protease inhibitor mixture, the spheroplast lysate was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with 10 strokes of the A-pestle. The lysate was then centrifuged for 60 min at 35,000 rpm (147,000 × g at rmax) in an SW50.1 rotor. Supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by Western blotting as described(14Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuolar vesicles were prepared as described(20Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), except that spheroplasts were washed once with 1.2 M sorbitol, then incubated 15 min at 30°C in either YEPD containing 1.2 M sorbitol or YEP containing 1.2 M sorbitol. After the incubation, the spheroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation, then lysed immediately. ATPase activities of isolated vesicles were measured at 37°C using the coupled enzyme assay of Lotscher et al.(21Lotscher H.-R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and a Lowry (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) assay was used to quantitate protein. In order to assess the amount of ATPase activity specific for V-type ATPases, vacuolar vesicles were preincubated with 100 nM concanamycin A (Wako Chemicals) for 20 min on ice, and the difference between the ATPase activities of vesicles with and without preincubation with inhibitor was taken as the vacuolar ATPase activity. (Concanamycin A is a highly specific inhibitor of V-type ATPases(23Drose S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar).) To determine whether the state of assembly of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase is altered in response to changes in extracellular conditions, yeast spheroplasts were biosynthetically labeled with Tran35S-label for 45 min and then shifted to different media containing unlabeled methionine for a 15-min “chase” time prior to immunoprecipitation. Fig. 1A shows that after labeling for 45 min, all of the previously identified subunits of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase can be co-precipitated with monoclonal antibody 8B1 against the 69-kDa catalytic subunit of the enzyme (lane 1), and there is little change in the distribution of subunits immunoprecipitated after a subsequent 15-min chase period in the same medium (lane 2). This indicates that assembly of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase is almost completed during the 45-min labeling time, and that the assembled complexes are stable through the subsequent 15-min chase period. Very similar complexes were obtained from cells chased in medium buffered to pH 5 (lane 5), buffered to pH 7.5 (lane 3), or containing 50 mM CaCl2 (lane 4). These conditions were chosen because yeast mutants lacking vacuolar H+-ATPase activity fail to grow in medium buffered to pH 7.5 or containing 100 mM CaCl2 but are able to grow on medium buffered to pH 5, suggesting that cellular requirements for the vacuolar H+-ATPase differ under these different growth conditions (19, 24, 25). However, these results indicate that the different media do not grossly affect assembled vacuolar H+-ATPase complexes. In contrast, assembly of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase was significantly affected by transferring the labeled cells to medium lacking glucose for 15 min (lane 6). Complexes co-precipitated from cells chased in medium without glucose showed greatly reduced levels of the 100-, 42-, 36-, and 17-kDa subunits. (Although there appears to be some reduction in the level of the 32-kDa subunit in Fig. 1A, this was not seen as consistently. The level of the 32-kDa subunit in the experiments shown in Fig. 2A and 5A was more typical.) The 60-, 32-, and 27-kDa proteins that remain associated with the 69-kDa subunit after incubation in medium lacking glucose have been implicated as members of the peripheral V1 sector of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, along with the 42-kDa subunit (reviewed in Ref. 4). The 100- and 17-kDa subunits have been shown to be integral membrane proteins(15Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Noumi T. Beltran C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18447-18453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the 36-kDa subunit appears to be closely associated with these subunits even though it is not an integral membrane subunit (14, 26).Figure 2:Disassembly and reassembly of the vacuolar H+-ATPase do not require new protein synthesis. Yeast cells were converted to spheroplasts and labeled with Tran35S-label for 45 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Labeled spheroplasts were then lysed immediately (lane 1), or chased for 20 min in YEPD buffered to pH 5 (lane 2), 40 min in YEPD buffered to pH 5 (lanes 3 and 6), 20 min in YEP buffered to pH 5 (lanes 4 and 7), or 20 min in YEP buffered to pH 5, followed by an additional 20 min with 2% glucose added (lanes 5 and 8). In lanes 6-8, the chase medium contained 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. All of the chase media contained 1.2 M sorbitol. Monoclonal antibodies 8B1 (A) and 10D7 (B) were used, and immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Molecular mass markers and H+-ATPase subunits are identified as inFig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1B shows the complexes immunoprecipitated from the same biosynthetically labeled spheroplasts by the 10D7 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes an epitope on the 100-kDa subunit that appears to be accessible only when the V1 subunits are not bound(15Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody has been used to localize (15Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitate (14Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) V0 complexes under conditions where the peripheral V1 complex cannot bind to the membrane. The 10D7 antibody immunoprecipitates a complex containing the 100-, 36-, and 17-kDa subunits, in addition to several other proteins that have not been characterized, from wild-type cells suggesting that the cells contain a pool of assembled V0 complexes that are not associated with the V1 subunits (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-5). After the chase period in no glucose medium (lane 6), there is an increase in the amount of 100-, 36-, and 17-kDa subunits immunoprecipitated by the 10D7 antibody. The results in Fig. 1 indicate that: 1) incubation in medium lacking glucose has caused dissociation of the peripheral V1 sector of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase from the integral membrane V0 complex, and 2) after dissociation, the subunits of each sector, with the exception of the 42-kDa subunit, remain assembled. The dissociation of the peripheral V1 sector would be expected to reduce the ATPase activity of vacuolar membranes. To assess this directly, vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated from spheroplasts incubated in the presence or absence of glucose immediately before lysis. Vesicles prepared from spheroplasts incubated in medium containing 2% glucose contained 3.9 units/mg of vacuolar ATPase activity (where 1 unit = 1 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min and vacuolar ATPase activity is taken as the ATPase activity inhibited by 100 nM concanamycin A). The spheroplasts incubated in the absence of glucose yielded membranes containing only 1.5 units/mg vacuolar ATPase activity. This suggests that incubation of spheroplasts in the absence of glucose results in a loss of 61.5% of the vacuolar ATPase activity from the membranes. The presence of relatively stable, assembled V1 and V0 sectors in the cells incubated in medium lacking glucose (Fig. 1) suggested that the disassembled complexes might remain competent for reassembly. To investigate whether disassembly of the vacuolar H+-ATPase is a reversible process, we incubated labeled spheroplasts first with medium lacking glucose for 20 min and then added back glucose for 20 min and examined the immunoprecipitated complexes. As shown in Fig. 2(A and B, lane 4), the assembled vacuolar H+-ATPase complexes were extensively dissociated after 20 min in medium without glucose. However, if glucose was then added back to the cells for 20 min (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 5), the complexes obtained were almost indistinguishable from those immunoprecipitated from cells incubated with glucose throughout the chase period (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 2 and 3). Neither disassembly nor reassembly required incubation of the spheroplasts at pH 5. Disassembly occurred in unbuffered medium lacking glucose, and reassembly occurred when glucose was added back to unbuffered medium. All of the labeled subunits are present in complexes reassembled during the chase period, so new synthesis of subunits is probably not necessary for reassembly. Nonetheless, it is still possible that other proteins involved in disassembly or reassembly must be newly synthesized. To address this possibility, we included 100 μg/ml cycloheximide in the chase medium (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 6-8) and examined the effects on the immunoprecipitated complexes. (This level of cycloheximide was shown previously to rapidly inhibit yeast protein synthesis(27Novick P. Ferro S. Schekman R.

Comparison of lanes 3 and 6 in Fig. 2 shows that cycloheximide does not appear to have a direct effect on the assembled vacuolar H+-ATPase complexes, and lanes 7 and 8 demonstrate that both disassembly and reassembly can occur in the absence of new protein synthesis. In order to obtain a quantitative estimate of the extent of disassembly and reassembly of the vacuolar H+-ATPase in the presence and absence of glucose, the distribution of the 100-, 36-, and 17-kDa subunits between the complexes immunoprecipitated by the 8B1 antibody (assembled V1V0 complexes) and the complexes immunoprecipitated by the 10D7 antibody (V0 subunits only) was measured using a phosphorimager. The results are shown in. In cells chased for 20 min in the presence of 2% glucose, 75-80% of the total quantity of these V0 subunits precipitated by both antibodies was co-precipitated with the V1 subunits, suggesting that most of the V0 subunits are found as part of fully assembled ATPase complexes. However, when the cells were subjected to a 20-min chase in the absence of glucose, only 22-33% of the subunits were immunoprecipitated by the 8B1 antibody and and 67-78% were precipitated by the 10D7 antibody, indicating that the three subunits are found predominantly in V0 complexes not containing V1 subunits. Readdition of glucose restored the distribution seen before cells were deprived of glucose. Disassembly and reassembly of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase were also visualized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, and the results are shown in Figure 3:, Figure 4:. Yeast vacuoles appear as depressions when cells are visualized under Nomarski optics (Figure 3:, Figure 4:, A, C, and E; Ref. 20). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with the 13D11 antibody, which recognizes the 60-kDa peripheral subunit of the enzyme, shows colocalization of the V1 sector with the vacuolar membrane in yeast cells incubated in the presence of 2% glucose (Fig. 3B). After the cells have been deprived of glucose for 20 min, the same antibody shows diffuse staining of the cytoplasm, in addition to some staining of the vacuolar membrane (Fig. 3D). Restoration of glucose to the cells results in loss of cytoplasmic staining and restoration of bright vacuolar membrane staining (Fig. 3F). These results are entirely consistent with the results from immunoprecipitations described in Figure 1:, Figure 2:. Further evidence of disassembly and reassembly of the vacuolar H+-ATPase complex was obtained from indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using the 10D7 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4, B, D, and F). This antibody was previously shown to give little or no staining of wild-type cells grown in the presence of 2% glucose(15Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in this experiment, there appears to be very little staining of cells incubated with glucose throughout (Fig. 4B) or cells deprived of glucose that subsequently had the glucose restored (Fig. 4F). However, the antibody did recognize the vacuolar membrane in cells deprived of glucose (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the epitope on the 100-kDa subunit is available in these cells. Previous experiments on mutants that fail to assemble the peripheral subunits onto the vacuolar membrane gave similar results(15Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that exposure of the 10D7 antigen reflects disassembly of the peripheral membrane subunits from the integral membrane complex. The microscopy results in Fig. 3 and 4 also eliminate any possibility that disassembly and reassembly occurs only in yeast spheroplasts, since whole cells were incubated in the presence and absence of glucose and fixed before they were converted to spheroplasts in these experiments.Figure 4:Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of the 100-kDa subunit in yeast cells treated under varied conditions. Cells were prepared as inFig. 3, but were stained with monoclonal antibody 10D7 to visualize the V0 sector when it is not complexed with the V1 subunits.

TCR-mediated death was examined in mice bearing an NGFI-B loss-of-function mutation, either by administration of antibodies to CD3 (anti-CD3) or in two well-characterized transgenic models expressing self-reactive TCRs. Both the extent and the rate of thymocyte death were unimpaired. Anti-CD3-induced death was normal in CD4+ peripheral T cells, in which death is mediated predominantly by the Fas signaling pathway. Thus, no unique requirement for NGFI-B is observed for thymic or peripheral T cell death."

Because E6 has p53-independent transforming activity, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for other E6-binding proteins. One such protein, E6BP, interacted with cancer-associated HPV E6 and with bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E6. The transforming activity of BPV-1 E6 mutants correlated with their E6BP-binding ability.

The induction of M-CSF mRNA expression by either oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) was attenuated by NO donors, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and 3-morpholinosydnonimine, but not by cGMP analogues, glutathione, or nitrite.

Inhibition of endogenous NO production by Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester promotes vasoconstriction and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion, processes which are mitigated, to some extent, by addition of cGMP analogues(14Kubes P.

Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Furthermore, enriching the diets of cholesterol-fed rabbits with L-arginine, the precursor of NO, improves endothelial-dependent relaxation, reduces leukocyte attachment to the endothelial surface, and limits the extent of atherosclerotic lesions(16Cooke J.P.

Although many effects of nitric oxide are attributed to its stimulation of guanylyl cyclase, little is known regarding other cellular pathway(s) mediated by nitric oxide. The findings of our recent study indicate that the regulation of endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression by NO is not mediated by cGMP, but rather is associated with the inhibition of nuclear binding protein, NF-κB(17De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.-B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). The induction of various inflammatory cytokines important in atherogenesis requires activation of NF-κB(18Libermann T.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.

Whitley M.Z. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). NF-κB was originally described as a heterodimeric cytosolic protein in B-cells which, upon activation, translocated into the nucleus where it binds to specific decameric sequences in the IgG κ light chain enhancer(21Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that this pleiotropic binding protein can also activate viral enhancer elements as well as transcriptionally induce the expression of many proinflammatory cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules(22Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 23Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D.

The NF-κB family includes p65, p105/p50, p100/p52, c-rel, and relB which bind as homo- or heterodimers to promoter regions of target genes(23Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 24Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, NF-κB consists predominantly of the p65 and p50 heterodimer(25Collins T. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 499-508PubMed Google Scholar). Since cellular adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines participate in atherogenesis and share common κB binding motifs in their transcriptional promoters, we hypothesized that NO may regulate their gene expression through NF-κB. This study, therefore, tested whether NO could regulate the expression of an important proatherogenic molecule, M-CSF, through NF-κB. All standard culture reagents were obtained from JRH Bioscience (Lenexa, KS). Glutathione, nitrite, sodium nitroprusside, dimethyl sulfoxide, dithiothreitol, L-arginine, heparin sulfate, cupric sulfate (CuSO4), polymyxin B, butylated hydroxytoluene, thiobarbituric acid, and 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and cGMP analogues, 8-bromo-cGMP and dibutyryl cGMP, were purchased from Sigma. GSNO was synthesized from glutathione and nitrite as described previously(26Kowaluk E.A. Fung H.-L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 1256-1264PubMed Google Scholar). Purified human low density lipoprotein (LDL, Lot No. 730793) and N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMA) were obtained from Calbiochem. The Limulus amebocyte lysate kinetic assay was performed by BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Recombinant human TNFα was purchased from Endogen, Inc. (Boston, MA). [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 32Pi (1000 Ci/mmol), and [3H]chloramphenicol (37 Ci/mmol) were supplied by DuPont NEN. The oligonucleotide corresponding to the two tandem κB sequences in the M-CSF promoter was synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). Rabbit polyclonal antisera to NF-κB subunits, p65 and p50, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Nylon transfer membranes were purchased from Schleicher and Schuell. The expression vectors containing the RSV promoter linked to NF-κB subunits, p65 and p50, were kindly provided by G. Nabel (University of Michigan). The human M-CSF promoter constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene were generously provided by D. Kufe (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Human saphenous vein and bovine aortic endothelial cells were cultured and characterized as described previously(27Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Only endothelial cells of less than three passages were used. Cells were pretreated with NO donors for 30 min prior to addition of LDL or TNFα. Cellular viability was determined by morphology and trypan blue exclusion. Native LDL (density 1.02-1.06 g/ml) from a single donor was isolated using a sequential ultracentrifugation method in the presence of butylated hydroxytoluene and polymyxin B as described previously(28Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its identity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cholesterol, triglyceride, and protein content were determined as described previously(27Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Oxidized LDL (80% lipid, 20% protein) was prepared by exposing samples of native LDL to CuSO4 (5 μM) at 37°C for 2 to 24 h. Both native and oxidized LDL were dialyzed with three changes of sterile buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, and 100 μg/ml polymyxin B, pH 7.4) before filtering through a 0.2-μm membrane. The degree of LDL oxidation was estimated by measuring the amounts of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) produced using a colorimetric assay standardized with malondialdehyde(29Yagi K. Biochem. Med. 1976; 15: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (2044) Google Scholar). The TBARS value is expressed as nanomoles of malondialdehyde per mg of LDL protein. RNA was extracted using guanidinium isothiocyanate and purified by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation (30). Equal amounts of total RNA (20 μg/lane) were separated by 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose membrane by capillary action, and baked (72°C) for 2 h prior to prehybridization. Radiolabeling of a 1.8-kilobase human M-CSF cDNA probe was performed using random hexamer priming with [α-32P]CTP and a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes and probe were hybridized overnight at 52°C in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and washed in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C before autoradiography at −80°C for 24-72 h. All blots were subsequently rehybridized with β-actin cDNA probe as an internal control (ATCC 37997, Rockville, MD). Confluent endothelial cells (5 × 106) were incubated with 32Pi (500 μCi) for 1 h prior to the addition of 8-bromo-cGMP at the indicated concentrations and incubated for an additional 1 h. The study was terminated by the addition of sodium phosphate (50 mM), trichloroacetic acid (20%), and sodium vanadate (1 mM). Cells were scraped and lysed by a Dounce homogenizer. Protein concentrations from cellular extracts were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins (50 μg) were suspended in denaturing buffer containing Tris-HCl (125 mM, pH 6.8), SDS (4%), glycerol (20%), and 2-mercaptoethanol (10%) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants and known molecular weight markers (Bethesda Research Laboratory) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% running, 4% stacking gel). The gels were then fixed with Coomassie Blue (0.4%), methanol (20%), and glacial acetic acid (10%) and dried by a gel dryer before autoradiography at −70°C for 12-24 h. Nuclei from 108 endothelial cells were prepared, and in vitro transcription with [32P]UTP was performed as described(27Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Linearized plasmids (1 μg) containing M-CSF, pGEM (Promega), and rat β-tubulin cDNAs were immobilized on nylon membranes using a vacuum-transfer slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell), and the membranes were hybridized to radiolabeled transcripts (∼5-8 × 107 cpm/ml) at 45°C for 48 h in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were then washed with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 65°C before autoradiography for 72 h at −80°C. For transient transfections, bovine rather than human endothelial cells were used because of their higher transfectional efficiency by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (32). Two different M-CSF promoter constructs, [-565]M1 and [-248]M4, linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene were used(33Yamada H. Iwase S. Mohri M. Kufe D. Blood. 1991; 78: 1988-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the indicated promoter constructs (30 μg): p.CAT (no promoter), pSV2.CAT (SV40 early promoter), M1, or M4. Approximately 60 h after transfection, cells were treated with ox-LDL (50 μg/ml) or TNFα (10 ng/ml). For co-transfection studies with RSVp65 and RSVp50, GSNO (0.2 mM) was added 12 h after transfection, and media were changed and GSNO was renewed every 12 h. As an internal control for transfection efficiency, pRSV.βGAL plasmid (10 μg) was co-transfected in all experiments. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cellular extracts were prepared using lysis buffer (100 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and one freeze-thaw cycle. CAT activity was determined by incubating the cellular extracts (100 μl) with [3H]chloramphenicol (50 μCi/ml) and n-butyryl coenzyme A (250 μg/ml) for 20 h at 37°C as described previously(34Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The relative CAT activity was calculated as the ratio of CAT to β-galactosidase activity. M-CSF promoter activity (-fold induction) was expressed as the ratio of relative CAT activity to the relative basal CAT activity of [-565]M1.CAT. Each experiment was performed three times in duplicate. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described(35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). The NF-κB oligonucleotide corresponding to the two tandem κB sites in the M-CSF promoter (GGGGATTTTCAGGGCC TGGAGGGAAAGTCCCTT) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified by Sephadex G-50 columns (Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were added to 32P-labeled NF-κB oligonucleotide (∼20,000 cpm, 0.2 ng) in buffer containing 2 μg of poly[dI·dC], 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol. DNA·protein complexes were resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresed at 12 V/cm for 3 h in low ionic strength buffer (0.5 × TBE) at 4°C. For supershift assays, the indicated antibody (15 μg/ml) was added to the nuclear extracts for 10 min before addition of radiolabeled probe. In some studies, GSNO or unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide (20 ng) was added directly to the nuclear extracts 10 min prior to addition of radiolabeled probe. Band intensities from Northern and in vitro transcription assay blots were analyzed densitometrically by the National Institutes of Health IMAGE program(36Rasband W. NIH Image Program. Vol. 1. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda1993: 49Google Scholar). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. compared to controls and among separate experiments. Paired and unpaired Student's t tests were employed to determine the significance of changes in CAT activity and densitometric measurements. A significant difference was considered for p values of less than 0.05. There were no observable adverse effects of oxidized LDL, GSNO, or SNP on cellular morphology, and cellular confluency (∼7 × 106 cells/T-150 cm2 flask) and viability were maintained for all treatment conditions described. LDL samples, L-NMA, and 8-bromo-cGMP had no detectable levels of endotoxin (<0.10 unit/ml). The native LDL was comprised of protein (6.2 ± 0.17 mg/ml), cholesterol (22 ± 2.0 mg/ml), and triglyceride (1.6 ± 0.14 mg/ml). The initial TBARS value was 0.2 ± 0.1 nmol/mg which increased to 1.6 ± 0.4 nmol/mg and 2.3 ± 0.6 nmol/mg after 6 h and 24 h of incubation with endothelial cells in Medium 199, respectively. LDL samples which have been oxidized by exposure to CuSO4 (5 μM) exhibited TBARS values ranging from 2.6 ± 1.2 nmol/mg after 2 h to 24.2 ± 5.1 nmol/mg after 24 h. Northern analyses revealed that TNFα induced the mRNA expression of M-CSF in a time-dependent manner with maximum induction occurring between 2 and 6 h after TNFα stimulation (Fig. 1A). Similarly, oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml, TBARS 13.4 nmol/mg) also induced the mRNA expression of M-CSF, but, compared to that of TNFα stimulation, maximum induction was 2.7-fold lower and occurred later at 24 h (Fig. 1B). The induction of M-CSF depended upon the degree of LDL oxidation as measured by the presence of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (Fig. 2). Mild to moderately oxidized LDL (TBARS 7.3 to 13.4 nmol/mg) more potently stimulated M-CSF expression than native LDL (TBARS 0.2 nmol/mg) or highly oxidized LDL (TBARS 24.2 nmol/mg) after 12 h.Figure 2:Northern analyses (20 μg of total RNA/lane) showing the effects of native (50 μg/ml, TBARS 0.2 nmol/mg) and oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml) on M-CSF mRNA expression at 24 h with respect to oxidative modification (TBARS). The effect of TNFα on M-CSF mRNA expression at 6 h is shown for comparison. Equal RNA loading for each experiment was verified by hybridization to β-actin. Experiments were performed twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The induction of M-CSF mRNA expression by oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml, TBARS 13.4 nmol/mg) or TNFα (10 ng/ml) was attenuated by S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO, 0.2 mM) in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Two other structurally different NO donors, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and 3-morpholinosydnonimine, but not glutathione (GSH) or nitrite, inhibited M-CSF mRNA expression induced by oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml, TBARS 13.4 nmol/mg) indicating that this effect was likely due to NO (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of endogenous NO production by L-NMA (1 mM) caused a 3.2-fold increase in M-CSF mRNA expression compared to basal levels (Fig. 4A). Addition of L-NMA to TNFα-stimulated cells augmented M-CSF mRNA expression by 3.3-fold compared to that of TNFα stimulation alone. GSNO was effective in reducing both basal and TNFα-stimulated M-CSF mRNA expression by 92%± 12% and 68%± 10%, respectively. Treatment of control and TNFα-stimulated endothelial cells with the cGMP analogue, 8-bromo-cGMP (1 mM), affected M-CSF mRNA expression only minimally suggesting that the activation of endothelial guanylyl cyclase does not mediate this inhibitory effect of NO. The cGMP analogue, 8-bromo-cGMP, however, did stimulate cGMP- and, possibly, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner as demonstrated by increases in protein phosphorylation in endothelial cells (Fig. 4B). In the presence of actinomycin D, GSNO (0.2 mM) did not alter the post-transcriptional stability of M-CSF mRNA induced by TNFα (Fig. 5A). The calculated half-life of M-CSF mRNA in the presence and absence of GSNO (0.2 mM) was not significantly different (7.5 ± 2.7 h versus 8.2 ± 2.4 h, p > 0.05). In vitro transcription studies showed a moderate basal transcriptional activity of the M-CSF gene under standard tissue culture conditions (Fig. 5B). Treatment with oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml, TBARS 13.4 nmol/mg) or TNFα (10 ng/ml) increased M-CSF gene transcription 7.8- and 18-fold relative to β-tubulin gene transcription, respectively. NO essentially abolished all transcriptional activity of the M-CSF gene induced by oxidized LDL or TNFα, but did not substantially affect β-tubulin gene transcription. Preliminary studies using different amounts of radiolabeled RNA transcripts demonstrate that under our experimental conditions, hybridization was linear and nonsaturable. The density of each M-CSF band was standardized to the density of its corresponding β-tubulin band. The specificity of each band was determined by the lack of hybridization to the nonspecific pGEM cDNA vector. To characterize further the effects of NO on M-CSF gene transcription, we transfected bovine aortic endothelial cells using two M-CSF promoter constructs, M1 and M4, linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene(33Yamada H. Iwase S. Mohri M. Kufe D. Blood. 1991; 78: 1988-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of the M-CSF promoter revealed putative DNA binding sequences for NF-κB, SP1, SSRE (shear-stress responsive element), “CAT” and “TTAAA” boxes, and initiation start site (Fig. 6A). [-565]M1 promoter contains two tandem κB sites, while the deletional [-248]M4 promoter lacks these κB sites. Stimulation with TNFα (10 ng/ml) or oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml, TBARS 13.4 nmol/mg) increased M1 promoter activity by 9.2- and 7.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 6B). Co-transfection of M1.CAT with the expression vector RSVp65 alone resulted in a 13-fold induction in M1 promoter activity compared to a 5.7-fold induction with a combination of RSVp65 and RSVp50 and 2.2-fold induction with RSVp50 alone. Treatment with GSNO (0.2 mM) was effective in decreasing M1 promoter activity induced by TNFα (65% reduction), oxidized LDL (72% reduction), and co-transfections with p65 alone (61% reduction) or in combination with p50 (52% reduction). Basal M4 promoter activity was 1.8-fold lower than that of basal M1. Co-transfection with RSVp65 with M4.CAT produced essentially no promoter activity. Stimulation with TNFα or oxidized LDL produced only a 2.5-fold induction of the non-κB containing M4 promoter activity. GSNO did not significantly affect M4 promoter activity induced by TNFα, ox-LDL, or co-transfection with RSVp65. Transcriptional repression was not due to general toxicity since GSNO did not affect basal M1 and M4 or the SV40 promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated rapid and near-maximal activation of NF-κB by TNFα after 30 min (Fig. 7). In contrast, the degree of NF-κB activation by native LDL (50 μg/ml, TBARS 0.2 nmol/mg) was smaller compared to TNFα and occurred only after 6 h when the measured TBARS value was 1.6 nmol/mg, presumably secondary to endothelial cell modification of native LDL. Activation of NF-κB by oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml, TBARS 13.4 nmol/mg) occurred in a time-dependent manner, and, after 6 h, resemble that of TNFα after 30 min. GSNO (0.2 mM) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) attenuated the activation of NF-κB by both oxidized LDL and TNFα (Figure 7:, Figure 8:). Addition of 8-bromo-cGMP (1 mM) did not affect TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB suggesting that NO's inhibitory effect was not due to guanylyl cyclase activation. GSNO was effective only when added to whole cells rather than directly to nuclear extracts suggesting that NO does not interfere with NF-κB binding to DNA (Fig. 8). Activation of NF-κB was also observed when endogenous NO production was inhibited by L-NMA (1 mM). However, L-NMA produced NF-κB activation to a lesser extent than did TNFα. Preliminary studies indicate that treatment with L-NMA (1 mM) reduced basal NO synthase activity by 80% (data not shown). Although the level of NF-κB activation by L-NMA treatment was much less compared to that caused by TNFα, L-NMA-induced NF-κB activation was more completely abolished by treatment with GSNO (0.2 mM). The indicated band was specific for NF-κB since, in the presence of antibodies to p50 and p65, this band was “supershifted” and attenuated. We have shown that both endogenous and exogenous nitric oxide (NO) can limit the expression of a proatherogenic cytokine, macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) induced by two pro-atherogenic mediators, TNFα and oxidized LDL. Since M-CSF may contribute to the development of macrophage-derived foam cells(4Rosenfeld M.E. Ylä-Herttuala S. Lipton B.A. Ord V.A. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 291-300PubMed Google Scholar, 6Clinton S.K. Underwood R. Hayes L. Sherman M.L. Kufe D.W. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 301-316PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of M-CSF expression by NO may be one mechanism by which NO can attenuate atherogenesis. NO's inhibitory effect on M-CSF mRNA expression was not mediated by stimulation of guanylyl cyclase since cGMP analogues did not inhibit M-CSF expression. This is in contrast to other antiatherogenic effects of NO which are mediated by cGMP such as vascular smooth muscle relaxation (12Bossaler C. Habib G.B. Yamamoto H. Williams C. Wells S. Henry P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 174-179Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar) and inhibition of platelet aggregation(10Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 92: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings provide a novel mechanism by which NO can modulate the expression of an important atherogenic cytokine, M-CSF. Actinomycin D studies and nuclear run-on assays indicated that the regulation of M-CSF expression occurred at the level of M-CSF gene transcription. Analyses of the M-CSF promoter revealed that two tandem κB binding sites located approximately 400 bp upstream from the initiation start site were necessary for full transcriptional induction by TNFα and oxidized LDL. These results agree with previous studies showing the obligatory role of nuclear binding protein NF-κB in transcriptionally activating the M-CSF promoter(33Yamada H. Iwase S. Mohri M. Kufe D. Blood. 1991; 78: 1988-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the deletional construct lacking the κB sites still exhibits substantial promoter activity in response to TNFα and oxidized LDL suggesting that other non-NF-κB binding proteins could also participate and perhaps act synergistically in transactivating the M-CSF promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the transcriptional repression of the M-CSF gene by NO was due principally to the inhibition of NF-κB activation. NO did not physically inhibit the binding of NF-κB to its cognate DNA since the addition of NO directly to nuclear extracts of TNFα-stimulated cells did not affect the activation of NF-κB. Thus, cellular factor(s) must be present in the intact cell which mediate NO's inhibitory effect on NF-κB activation. Interestingly, co-transfection with p65 alone resulted in a greater increase in M-CSF promoter activity compared to that achieved with the combination of p65 and p50. Since the p50 homodimer can bind κB sites, but is a relatively weak transactivator(37Shu H.-B. Agranoff A.B. Nabel E.G. Leung K. Duckett C.S. Neish A.S. Collins T. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6283-6289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), co-transfection with p65 and p50 presumably leads to a competition between the p65 homodimer with the p65/p50 heterodimer and the p50 homodimer for κB sites, resulting overall in less promoter activity compared to that of the p65 homodimer. Furthermore, the ability of NO to attenuate M-CSF promoter activity in cells co-transfected with either p65 alone or in combination with p50 suggests that NO's inhibitory effects are likely mediated through p65. NF-κB mediates transcriptional activation of the M-CSF gene in response to TNFα(33Yamada H. Iwase S. Mohri M. Kufe D. Blood. 1991; 78: 1988-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the activation of NF-κB by TNFα and bacterial lipopolysaccharide involves the generation of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion(38Marui N. Offermann M.K. Swerlick R. Kunsck C. Rosen C.S. Ahmad M. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Indeed, antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate attenuate the activation of NF-κB(38Marui N. Offermann M.K. Swerlick R. Kunsck C. Rosen C.S. Ahmad M. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 39Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). NF-κB, therefore, is an attractive candidate for inhibition by nitric oxide (NO) since, under certain conditions, NO can function as an antioxidant through its scavenging effects on superoxide anion(40Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3413) Google Scholar, 41Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). NO interacts with superoxide anion to form peroxynitrite, thereby diverting superoxide anion away from its dismutation product, hydrogen peroxide(41Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). Thus, less hydrogen peroxide would be available to activate NF-κB(38Marui N. Offermann M.K. Swerlick R. Kunsck C. Rosen C.S. Ahmad M. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 39Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 40Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3413) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of NO, the consequence of peroxynitrite formation remains to be determined, but can lead to tyrosine phosphorylation(42Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6675) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB and increase in M-CSF expression also occurred in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NMA. Endogenous NO production by the constitutive NO synthase may therefore tonically inhibit the expression of proinflammatory genes through suppression of NF-κB. Interestingly, both TNFα and oxidized LDL decrease the expression of endothelial NO synthase (27Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 43Yoshizumi M. Perrella M.A. Burnett Jr., J.C. Lee M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) which, in turn, may serve to augment the activation of NF-κB. Treatment with NO donors produced further inhibition of basal and TNFα-stimulated expression of M-CSF. Such higher levels of NO may be encountered by endothelial cells at sites of inflammation where induction of NO synthase activities in macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells could generate concentrations of NO comparable to that given exogenously in this study(44Radomski M.W. Rees D.D. Dutra A. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In solution, NO has a very short half-life(42Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6675) Google Scholar). However, in the local environment of an inflammatory atherosclerotic lesion, NO can act at short distances, given its intracellular origin and the close proximity of endothelial cells to macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells and, thus, be less subject to inactivation. Our findings provide a novel antiatherogenic effect of NO which is independent of its classically recognized effect on soluble guanylyl cyclase. Although we report here the inhibitory effects of NO on NF-κB activation and M-CSF expression, these effects may extend to other inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules which contain functional κB sites in their transcriptional promoters. We propose that NO is an important physiological mediator of both homeostasis and inflammation. We thank Drs. G. Nabel for RSVp65 and RSVp50 expression vectors and H. Yamada and D. Kufe for M-CSF promoter constructs."

This is accomplished via a physical interaction of Gβγ and a domain within the carboxyl terminus of βARK which overlaps with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The PH domain of βARK not only binds Gβγ but also interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Based on previous mapping of the Gβγ binding region of βARK, and conserved residues within the PH domain, we have constructed a series of mutants in the carboxyl terminus of βARK in order to determine important residues involved in Gβγ and PIP2 binding. To examine the effects of mutations on Gβγ binding, we employed three different methodologies: direct Gβγ binding to GST fusion proteins; the ability of GST fusion proteins to inhibit Gβγ-mediated βARK translocation to rhodopsin-enriched rod outer segments; and the ability of mutant peptides expressed in cells to inhibit Gβγ-mediated inositol phosphate accumulation. Direct PIP2 binding was also assessed on mutant GST fusion proteins. Ala residue insertion following Trp643 completely abolished the ability of βARK to bind Gβγ, suggesting that a proper α-helical conformation is necessary for the Gβγ·βARK interaction. In contrast, this insertional mutation had no effect on PIP2 binding. Both Gβγ binding and PIP2 binding were abolished following Ala replacement of Trp643, suggesting that this conserved residue within the last subdomain of the PH domain is crucial for both interactions. Other mutations also produced differential effects on the physical interactions of the βARK carboxyl terminus with Gβγ and PIP2. These results suggest that the last PH subdomain and its neighboring sequences within the carboxyl terminus of βARK, including Trp643, Leu647, and residues Lys663-Arg669, are critical for Gβγ binding while Trp643 and residues Asp635-Glu639 are important for the PH domain to form the correct structure for binding to PIP2.

These include regulation of certain isoforms of adenylyl cyclases, activation of some phospholipase C β isoforms and phospholipase A2, modulation of muscarinic K+ channels, mediation of the pheromone-induced mating response in yeast, binding to retinal phosducin, and stimulation of G protein-coupled receptor-specific kinases such as muscarinic receptor kinase and β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK)(1Clapham D.E.

Although the role of Gβγ in various signal transduction pathways has been established, the structural and molecular basis of the interaction between Gβγ and its effectors has yet to be fully understood(7Inglese J.

The specific region of βARK which directly interacts with and binds Gβγ is located within the carboxyl 125-amino-acid residue stretch(13Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

It has been demonstrated that this domain can be utilized to probe and dissect a broad range of Gβγ-mediated signaling pathways. The Gβγ-binding domain of βARK includes a pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain) that has been found in a variety of proteins involved in cellular signaling(17Haslam R.J. Koide H.B.

Although the function of the PH domain is not clear, several hypotheses have been raised and tested. The PH domains of numerous proteins appear to bind Gβγ to varying extents(22Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these PH domain peptides have been shown to behave as antagonists of Gβγ-mediated signaling in intact cells, such as Gβγ-mediated inositol phosphate (IP) production and Gβγ-mediated p21ras-GTP exchange and MAP kinase activation (23). The region responsible for binding Gβγ, however, is not identical to the PH domain, but rather encompasses the carboxyl portion of the PH domain plus immediately distal sequences. A 28-mer peptide (Trp643 to Ser670) containing the carboxyl portion of the PH domain of βARK (see Fig. 1) inhibited Gβγ-mediated activation of βARK1(13Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J.

The core structures are almost superimposable, consisting of a β-barrel of seven antiparallel β-sheets and a carboxyl-terminal amphiphilic α-helix. The structural similarity to other proteins immediately suggests that one function of PH domains is to bind small lipophilic molecules or peptides. Indeed, some PH domains can apparently bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the cleft of the β-barrel(30Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The PH domain of spectrin has been shown to be the site of membrane interaction(31Davis L.H. Bennett V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4409-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PH domain of the B-cell tyrosine kinase, however, binds protein kinase C (32Yao L. Kawakami Y Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) as well as Gβγ subunits(33Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), suggesting that the function of PH domains is more complex. The structures of PH domains suggest that the carboxyl-terminal α-helix including the most conserved Trp residue may mediate Gβγ association. Simonds et al.(34Simonds W.F. Manji H.K. Lupas A.N. Garritsen A. Trends Biol. Chem. 1993; 18: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggested that the G protein α, β, and γ subunits form a triple coiled-coil structure through the amino termini and that the dissociation of Gα from the Gβγ complex allows βARK to form a new triple coiled-coil structure through the 28-mer peptide region encompassing the PH domains. Recent evidence, however, demonstrates that the trypsin-digested Gβ subunit, in which the putative NH2-terminal coiled-coil domain of Gβ is missing, still binds to βARK(35Wang D.S. Shaw R. Winkelmann J.C. Shaw G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In order to determine more precisely which residues in the Gβγ-binding domain of βARK are crucial for this specific protein-protein interaction and to test the triple coiled-coil hypothesis, this report studies the Gβγ binding abilities of a series of βARK1 constructs containing mutations in the PH domain and adjacent sequences. Effects of these mutations on the ability of the βARK PH domain to bind to PIP2 were also examined. Bovine brain Gβγ was purified in our laboratory. The cDNA for the human α2-C10 AR was cloned in our laboratory. The cDNA for the human M1 AChR was kindly provided by Dr. Ernest Peralta. The cDNAs encoding Gβ1 and Gγ2 were kindly provided by Dr. Mel Simon. Sources of other reagents were as described previously(13Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

All mutants of the βARK1 carboxyl terminus (ct) were constructed with the GST fusion vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) by standard techniques utilizing the polymerase chain reaction and wild type bovine βARK1 as the template as described(13Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated βARK1ct fusion protein construct (δ671-689) (Fig. 1) was used as the template for the KKKR→EEEE (K663E, K665E, K667E, R669E) mutant. All mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing using Sequenase (United States Biochemical Corp.). Mutant constructs were introduced into the Escherichia coli strain NM522 or BL21. The fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously using glutathione-agarose(22Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding various mutant proteins were amplified from the pGEX plasmid cDNAs encoding the corresponding mutant GST fusion protein to construct EcoRI-BclI minigene cassettes and inserted into the mammalian expression vector pRK5 as described(15Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These DNAs were used for transfection of COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described(23Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Touhara K. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12984-12989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Expression of the mutant peptides was determined by Western blot of whole cell lysates as described using anti-βARKct serum(15Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of bovine brain Gβγ to the fusion proteins and the detection of bound Gβγ were accomplished essentially as described previously(22Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 nM GST fusion protein and 73 nM purified bovine brain Gβγ were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.01% Lubrol, and the bound Gβγ on the immobilized beads was detected by using antibodies to the Gβ subunit (DuPont NEN). Laser densitometry was used to quantitate the relative amounts of bound Gβγ. Translocation of βARK1 to rod outer segment membranes and its inhibition by the fusion proteins were carried out as described previously(12Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 22Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified recombinant βARK1 and urea-stripped rod outer segment membranes were incubated at 30°C for 5 min in either the presence or absence of bovine Gβγ (185 nM). Incubations containing Gβγ additionally contained one of the fusion proteins (1 μM). Following incubation, samples were subjected to centrifugation at 350,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant and pellet obtained were assayed for βARK1 activity. Quantitation of the band corresponding to phosphorylated rhodopsin was accomplished using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with receptor cDNA and either empty pRK5 vector DNA or pRK-mutant βARK1 DNA. In some experiments, cells were cotransfected with Gβ1 and Gγ2 cDNAs rather than receptor DNA. After 24 h of incubation, cells were prelabeled with 2 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol for 24 h. Cells were then stimulated for 45 min with or without agonist, and IP accumulation was determined by Dowex anion-exchange chromatography as described(15Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fusion proteins (0.5-1 μg) in phosphate-buffered saline were incubated in polycarbonate centrifuge tubes (7 × 20 mm) for 10 min at room temperature. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles or PC vesicles containing 5% PIP2 (Sigma) were added for a final lipid concentration of 0.8 mg/ml in 30 μl. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature and 5 min on ice, the tubes were then centrifuged at 100,000 revolutions/minute (TL-100 rotor) for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to a new tube. The percentage of fusion protein in the supernatant and pellet was determined by using Western blot analysis (ECL, Amersham Corp.) and densitometry. We focused on subdomain 6 of the PH domain and its adjacent sequences to construct various mutants of the βARK carboxyl-terminal peptide as shown in Fig. 1. The Trp643 residue in subdomain 6 is perfectly conserved in all PH domains as are several hydrophobic residues. In addition, clusters of acidic (Asp or Glu) and basic (Lys or Arg) residues are found in the Gβγ binding region of PH domains. Thus, we made a series of point mutations around the most conserved Trp643 in βARK1 and also reversed the ionic charge of the acidic and basic regions. In addition, since this region is predicted, by computer analysis, to form an α-helix we inserted 1 or 2 Ala residues to disrupt the proper orientation of the helical structure. Fig. 2A shows the purified GST fusion proteins. The βARK1ct fusion protein mutant KKKR→EEEE co-migrates with the truncated wild type fusion protein (δ671-689) since the mutant is derived from the δ671-689. Other mutant fusion proteins derived from the wild type fusion protein (GST-βARKct; Pro467-Leu689) migrate as expected except the E646K mutant. This mutant migrates faster than the wild type due to either a change in the ionic strength or some degradation. Because the mutant peptide migrates close to the δ671-689, it is likely that sequences up to Ser670 are still intact. The Gβγ binding abilities of these mutant GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2A) were assessed by the direct binding assay shown in Fig. 2B. The truncated wild type δ671-689, still significantly binds Gβγ (although weaker than the wild type), consistent with our previous data (13). When the basic residues in the truncated protein were changed to acidic residues (KKKR→EEEE), the Gβγ binding activity was completely lost, suggesting that these basic residues are crucial for the Gβγ binding ability of βARK. All other mutations altered Gβγ binding to varying extents, with the most deleterious mutations being W643A and L647G. K645E, E646K, and DSD→KKK still display some binding, although significantly weaker than the wild type (Fig. 2, B and C). Since Arg and Ser are most frequently substituted with Trp according to the Dayhoff's table(36Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. Vol. 5. National Biochemical Research Foundation, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington D. C.1978Google Scholar), W643S and W643R were also tested. The binding of these mutants is similar to that of W643A. Finally, the effect of 1 or 2 Ala residue insertions after Trp643 (WA and WAA, respectively) was assessed. These insertions completely block binding activity, suggesting that the proper orientation of residues in the α-helix is disrupted. In order to confirm the relative binding affinity of the mutant fusion proteins, a fixed concentration (1 μM) of each was tested for the ability to inhibit Gβγ-mediated translocation of βARK1 to rod outer segment membranes. As shown in Fig. 3, the wild type βARK1ct fusion protein significantly inhibits Gβγ-mediated translocation of βARK1. The truncated mutant, δ671-689, also inhibits the translocation, but less effectively than the wild type, consistent with the direct Gβγ binding data. Other mutants are less effective inhibitors, but the relative efficacy among the mutants is consistent with the direct binding data. For example, the mutations with two Ala insertions (WAA) had no inhibitory effect, but K645E and E646K, which bind more Gβγ than WAA in the direct binding assay (Fig. 2B), slightly inhibited Gβγ-mediated βARK translocation. Thus, the relative inhibitory effects of these fusion proteins correlate well with the relative binding activities observed in the direct Gβγ-binding assay. The DSD→KKK mutant, which shows moderate Gβγ binding in the direct binding assay, did not inhibit translocation of βARK1. However, the inability of this mutant to bind PIP2, as described later, probably is the reason for this discrepancy. Since bacterially expressed proteins are utilized in the above two assays, we constructed plasmid minigenes encoding the same mutant βARKct domains and expressed them in mammalian cells. In COS-7 cells, agonist stimulation of transiently expressed α2-ARs produces pertussis toxin-sensitive, Gβγ-mediated PI hydrolysis. In contrast, agonist stimulation of M1-AChRs produces pertussis toxin-insensitive, Gβγ-independent PI hydrolysis mediated via Gqα subunits. We utilized these two pathways to examine the ability of co-expressed mutant βARKct peptides to selectively antagonize Giβγ-mediated PI hydrolysis. Expression of each mutant peptide was confirmed by Western blot as described previously(15Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that the level of cellular expression of all mutant peptides was similar (data not shown). Co-expression of wild type βARKct peptide resulted in ∼70% attenuation of α2-AR-mediated IP production, while the mutant βARKct peptides WAA, L647G, and W643A had no significant effect (Fig. 4A). These mutants were shown to have the lowest Gβγ binding activities according to the direct Gβγ binding assay and the translocation assay (Fig. 2 and 3). Other mutant peptides, K645E, Q642G, E646K, and K644E, inhibited α2-AR-stimulated IP production. When assayed for the ability to antagonize M1-AChR-mediated IP production, none of the peptides exhibited significant activity (Fig. 4B). It is of note that the wild type peptide, which binds PIP2, did not attenuate the M1-AChR-mediated PI hydrolysis by phospholipase C, suggesting that the PH domain peptide does not sequester the phospholipase C substrate, PIP2, under these conditions. The effect of the mutant peptides on IP production provoked by co-expression of Gβ and Gγ was also determined. The results are consistent with the α2-AR data (Fig. 4C), demonstrating that the inhibitory effects are dependent on the ability to sequester Gβγ subunits specifically in intact cells. Some PH domains including that of βARK have been shown to bind PIP2 in the cleft of the NH2-terminal β-barrel(30Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The ability of the mutants to bind PIP2 was assessed and compared to the Gβγ binding ability. Binding of mutant GST fusion proteins to PC vesicles containing 5% PIP2 was examined using a centrifugation assay. The nonspecific binding of GST-βARKct wild type fusion protein to PC vesicles is relatively high (45-60% in pellet after centrifugation) (Fig. 5) in comparison to native βARK. Nonetheless, the binding of the wild type fusion protein to PIP2-containing PC vesicles is clearly significantly higher, since no fusion protein is detected in the supernatant. Interestingly, much less nonspecific binding to PC vesicles was observed for some mutant fusion proteins such as G642G, δ671-689, and KKKR→EEEE (Fig. 5). Thus, the carboxyl end of the fusion protein appears to be lipophilic. The W643A mutant and the DSD→KKK mutant bind significantly less to PIP2-containing PC vesicles (Fig. 5), suggesting that the β-barrel structure necessary for the PIP2 binding was impaired by these mutations. The DSD→KKK mutant did not inhibit the translocation of βARK (Fig. 3) perhaps due to its weak PIP2 binding. Other mutants exhibited significant translocation to PIP2-containing vesicles (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the Ala insertion, WA, and the KKKR→EEEE mutants, which did not bind to Gβγ, still contained PIP2 binding activity. On the other hand, a mutant which still had some Gβγ-binding activity (DSD→KKK) showed less PIP2 binding. These data suggest that crucial residues for the Gβγ binding activity are quite different from those for PIP2 binding. The Gβγ binding region of the PH domain of βARK is in a 125-amino-acid residue stretch located within the carboxyl terminus (13). This region includes the 28-mer peptide (Trp643-Ser670) that shows inhibitory activity on the Gβγ-mediated activation of βARK(13Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The region of this 28-mer peptide is the putative triple coiled-coil domain and encompasses the most conserved last subdomain of the PH domain(34Simonds W.F. Manji H.K. Lupas A.N. Garritsen A. Trends Biol. Chem. 1993; 18: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The homology between two Gβγ-binding proteins, βARK and phosducin, starts at subdomain 4 of the PH domain of βARK and continues to the adjacent sequences of the βARK PH domain(25Hawes B.E. Touhara K. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29825-29830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we made a series of mutants from the region encompassing the last subdomain of the PH domain. Mutations at Trp643, Leu647, or within the cluster of basic residues located more distally most effectively reduced the ability of βARK to bind to Gβγ and were less capable of inhibiting Gβγ-mediated IP production. These residues are fairly conserved among the PH domain-containing proteins (Fig. 1). Notably, the Trp residue in subdomain 6 is 100% conserved in the PH domain sequences. Moreover, the crucial residues for Gβγ binding such as Trp643, Leu637, Lys664, and Lys648 are 100% conserved among members of the βARK family (from human to bovine) and the Drosophila GPRK1 that bind Gβγ (Fig. 1). Based on the triple coiled-coil hypothesis, Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits form a coiled-coil structure through their amino termini, and the dissociation of Gα from Gβγ subunits allows βARK to form a new triple coiled-coil(34Simonds W.F. Manji H.K. Lupas A.N. Garritsen A. Trends Biol. Chem. 1993; 18: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic and ionic interactions of the residues within the 28-mer peptide region were thought to explain the mechanism of binding of βARK and Gβγ subunits. Based on this model, Lys644, Lys645, and Glu646 provide crucial hydrogen bonds, and Trp643 and Leu647 participate in the hydrophobic interactions. However, the three-dimensional structures of the PH domains of pleckstrin, spectrin, and dynamin suggest that the Trp residue faces the inside of the protein rather than localizing to the surface of the helix(26Yoon H.S. Hajduk P.J. Petros A.M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesnik S.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27Macias M.J. Musacchio A. Ponstingl H. Nilges M. Saraste M.

Biol. 1994; 1: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Moreover, the trypsin-digested Gβ subunit, which lacks the coiled-coil sequence of Gβ, still binds to the PH domain of βARK and spectrin(35Wang D.S. Shaw R. Winkelmann J.C. Shaw G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Together with our results that the Lys644, Lys645, and Glu646 mutants still bind to Gβγ and inhibit Gβγ-mediated IP production, these observations suggest that the interaction between Gβγ and βARK cannot simply be explained by the tripled coiled-coil model. Nonetheless, the fact that the alanine insertions after Trp643 impair Gβγ binding activity suggests that this region could form an α-helical structure like other PH domains, thereby playing a crucial role in interacting with Gβγ. The binding of PIP2 to the PH domain of βARK was impaired by the W643A mutation. According to the three-dimensional structure from other PH domains, the Trp residue interacts with the core of the β-barrel, most likely contributing to domain stability. We have made several Trp mutants from other PH domain-containing proteins, and bacterial expression of these mutants was lower, confirming that the Trp residue and perhaps the carboxyl α-helix are important to stabilize the domain structure.2 2K. Touhara, R. J. Lefkowitz, unpublished results. Therefore, the most conserved Trp residue is critical for both Gβγ binding and stablization of the PIP2-binding cleft in the NH2 terminus of the βARK PH domain. Mutations in the cluster of anionic residues located in the beginning of the carboxyl α-helix (DSD→KKK mutation) attenuated binding to PIP2. Although the DSD→KKK mutant binds Gβγ as well as K645E or E646K, the ability of the DSD→KKK mutant to inhibit Gβγ-mediated βARK translocation to rod outer segment membranes was less than that of K645E or E646K, consistent with the evidence that both PIP2 and Gβγ are required for PH domain-mediated membrane translocation of βARK(37Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Other mutants with markedly impaired Gβγ binding still possess PIP2 binding activity, suggesting that these mutations do not result in global misfolding of the domain peptides. The region of the PH domain that interacts with Gβγ has been mapped using guanine nucleotide releasing factor and phospholipase Cγ, demonstrating that the NH2-terminal half of PH domain is not necessary for Gβγ binding activity(22Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, this was confirmed by using the PH domain of Bruton tyrosine kinase(33Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Apparently, the carboxyl α-helix of PH domain mediates the interaction with Gβγ. One function of the NH2-terminal region of the PH domain, in contrast, is binding to PIP2 (30). Moreover, the PH domain of Bruton tyrosine kinase has been shown to bind protein kinase C at the NH2-terminal region of the PH domain, based on the evidence that the mutation of Arg28 in the PH domain resulted in lower protein kinase C binding capacity (32). Considering the heterogeneity in sequences of PH domains, various other molecules have been implicated as ligands for the PH domain. Since the molecules which bind PH domains seem to be quite diverse ranging from lipids to macromolecules, the function of the PH domain and the mechanisms of PH domain action may be quite complex and delicately regulated. In at least one instance, binding of Gβγ and PIP2 to the PH domain of βARK appears to be cooperative, since binding of the COOH terminus of the PH domain to Gβγ potentially affects PIP2 binding(37Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The following novel conclusions emerge from our studies. First, we have identified the critical residues involved in Gβγ binding to the βARK PH domain and localized these within subdomain 6 of the PH domain and the adjacent region. Second, although the region can form an α-helical structure which is crucial for the Gβγ interaction, the Gβγ-βARK interaction cannot simply be explained by a triple coiled-coil model. Third, the effects of mutations in the βARK PH domain on the ability to bind Gβγ are distinct from those on PIP2 binding. Finally, the most highly conserved Trp in subdomain 6 of the PH domain is absolutely required for both Gβγ and PIP2 binding. We thank W. Carl Stone for assisting in mutant DNA construction and sequencing, W. Darrel Capel for purified βARK, rod outer segment membranes, and Gβγ, Sabrina T. Exum for assisting tissue culture, and Drs. J.

Physiol. 1983; 19: 190-195Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 2Herath P.R.J. Hemingway J. Weerasinghe I.S. Jayawardena K.G.I. Pestic. Biochem.

Physiol. 1991; 41: 305-318Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the resistance mechanism has been studied in depth at the biochemical and/or molecular level in only a few species. In the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus and the aphid Myzus persicae, amplification of at least one esterase gene underlies the increase in esterase activity, with up to 250 copies of an esterase gene per genome being recorded in Culex (8-10). The esterases involved in both species are standard B or serine esterases according to the classification of Aldridge(11Aldridge W.N. Biochem. J. 1953; 53: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). This is a widely distributed family of enzymes, which hydrolyze carboxylester, amide, and thioester bonds in a variety of compounds. The mosquito C. quinquefasciatus is a major biting nuisance insect worldwide, and a vector of filarial and viral disease on at least two continents. Esterase banding patterns after polyacrylamide or starch gel electrophoresis of crude homogenates of this mosquito can be complex(12Callaghan A. Hemingway J. Malcolm C.A. Biochem. Genet. 1993; 31: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 13Georghiou G.P. Pasteur N. J. Econ. Entomol. 1978; 71: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Esterases can be classified on the basis of their biochemical, molecular, immunological, and electrophoretic characteristics, although their broad substrate specificities and multi-allelic nature make classification difficult. A classification system based on the esterase's preference for the general esterase substrates α- or β-naphthyl acetate and their relative electrophoretic mobilities has been suggested(14Raymond M. Pasteur N. Georghiou G.P. Mellon R.B. Wirth M.C. Hawley M. J. Med. Entomol. 1987; 24: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the basis of this classification, two predominant elevated esterase phenotypes, B1 and co-elevated A2/B2, which cause insecticide resistance, can be distinguished electrophoretically in the mosquito. The A2/B2 phenotype is by far the most common, occurring in all continents where C. quinquefasciatus is found. The elevated A2 and B2 esterases are in complete linkage disequilibrium in mosquito populations, i.e. the two esterases are co-elevated in all mosquitoes. Amplification of the B1 esterase was first shown in the Californian Tem-R strain of mosquito(9Mouches C. Pasteur N. Berge J.B. Hyrien O. Raymond M. De Saint Vincent B.R. De Silvestri M. Georghiou G.P. Science. 1986; 233: 778-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Immunological and molecular studies have since shown that B2 and B1 were originally alleles of the same locus and that the B2 gene is also amplified in resistant insects(10Raymond M. Beyssat-Arnaouty V. Sivasubramanian N. Mouches C. Georghiou G.P. Pasteur N. Biochem. Genet. 1989; 27: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Mouches C. Magnin M. Berge J.B.

Initial reports suggested that there was no cross-reaction between the A and B esterases at either an immunological or molecular level, and it was concluded that if these genes had arisen from duplication of a common ancestral gene, this must undoubtedly have occurred a long time ago(15Mouches C. Magnin M. Berge J.B. De Silvestri M. Beyssat V. Pasteur N. Georghiou G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2113-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Fournier D. Bride J.-M. Mouches C. Raymond M. Magnin M. Berge J.-B. Pasteur N. Georghiou G.P. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 27: 211-217Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, we have recently shown that a polyclonal antiserum raised to the nondenatured A2 esterase does cross-react with the B2, although the specificity is ∼50-fold lower for B2 than A2, suggesting that the two enzymes share some common epitopes(19Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Ketterman A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 22: 127SCrossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 20Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 51 (in press)Google Scholar). We here report the original cloning and cDNA sequence of the A2 mosquito esterase from an insecticide-resistant strain of C. quinquefasciatus from Peliyagoda, Sri Lanka(21Peiris H.T.R. Hemingway J. Bull. Entomol. Res. 1993; 83: 127-132Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence is compared with the other mosquito and aphid esterases that are involved in insecticide resistance. We also show that the underlying mechanism of A2 elevation in the Pel RR insecticide-resistant strain is gene amplification. The Culex esterase nomenclature is currently out of line with that used for other organisms, and there is confusion between the earlier general esterase classification (11Aldridge W.N. Biochem. J. 1953; 53: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and that subsequently proposed for mosquitoes(14Raymond M. Pasteur N. Georghiou G.P. Mellon R.B. Wirth M.C. Hawley M. J. Med. Entomol. 1987; 24: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Karunaratne (22Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Characterization of Multiple Variants of Carboxylesterases Which Are Involved in Insecticide Resistance in the Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. Ph.D. thesis, University of London. 1994; Google Scholar) has proposed that the Culex esterases should be renamed using α and β rather than the A and B of Raymond et al.(14Raymond M. Pasteur N. Georghiou G.P. Mellon R.B. Wirth M.C. Hawley M. J. Med. Entomol. 1987; 24: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), with numerical superscripts denoting sequence variants with the same electrophoretic mobility. Hence the two amplified B1s, which differ in their inferred amino acid sequence but are electrophoretically identical, become Estβ11 and Estβ12, from the Californian and Cuban strains of Culex, respectively, and the nonelevated B from the Sri Lankan Pel SS strain, again with the same electrophoretic mobility, becomes Estβ13. This system ensures that esterases can still be named initially on the basis of their electrophoretic mobilities, but distinct DNA sequence variants can also be indicated as this level of data becomes available. As this nomenclature system will be adopted in this paper, a summary of the past and proposed nomenclature for mosquito strains where esterase DNA sequence data is available is given in Table I. On the basis of this classification(22Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Characterization of Multiple Variants of Carboxylesterases Which Are Involved in Insecticide Resistance in the Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. Ph.D. thesis, University of London. 1994; Google Scholar), the Pel RR A2 esterase now becomes Estα21, as the first available sequence of this esterase.Table I:Suggested nomenclatures for the esterases of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus Open table in a new tab A heterogeneous population (Pel) of mosquito was collected from Peliyagoda, Sri Lanka, in 1986. It was selected to give an insecticide-susceptible strain, Pel SS, and a resistant strain, Pel RR (23, 24). Pel RR was 31-fold more resistant to the organophosphorus insecticide temephos than Pel SS(25Peiris H.T.R. Hemingway J. Bull. Entomol. Res. 1990; 80: 49-55Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Pel SS strain was obtained by multiple single family selection from the Pel strain(23Amin A.M. Peiris H.T.R. Med. Vet. Entomol. 1990; 4: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Pel RR strain was obtained by mass selection with temephos(24Peiris H.T.R. Hemingway J. Bull. Entomol. Res. 1990; 80: 453-457Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since then, insecticide resistance in this strain has been maintained by exposing fourth instar larvae every third generation to the LD50 concentration of temephos. The only organophosphate resistance mechanism in this strain is co-elevation of the Estα21 and Estβ21 esterases. A polyclonal antiserum was prepared by injecting a New Zealand White rabbit with purified nondenatured Estα21 from Pel RR. The esterase was administered after mixing with reconstituted Ribi adjuvant to give a final enzyme concentration of 200 μg/ml. Four injections of 1 ml of antigen were given at 2-week intervals. Each injection was split between intramuscular, intradermal, and subcutaneous sites(26Jayawardena K.G.I. Purification and Characterization of Two Carboxylesterases from Organophosphate Resistant Culex quinquefasciatus from Sri Lanka. Ph.D. thesis, University of London. 1992; Google Scholar). The resultant antiserum had a high level of specificity to Estα2 and much lower (∼50-fold) levels of sensitivity to the Estβ2 and Estβ1 esterases and the organophosphate target site acetylcholinesterase(19Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Ketterman A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 22: 127SCrossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 20Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 51 (in press)Google Scholar). This antiserum was used to screen a Pel RR cDNA expression library. The cDNA for library construction was synthesized from 5 μg of mRNA from fourth instar Pel RR larvae by a method previously used(17Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cDNA was blunted and size-selected (>400 base pairs) on a Sephacryl S-400 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After EcoRI linker addition (Promega) and subsequent phosphorylation, the cDNA was ligated into Lambda ZAP II (Stratagene). This vector allows plasmid containing cDNAs to be directly excised from the phage library. The bacteriophage arms were supplied digested with EcoRI and dephosphorylated. 5 μg of arms were ligated to 125 ng of cDNA and packaged with Packagene extracts (Promega). Approximately 200,000 recombinant clones were obtained. This was carried out with the Protoblot Immunoscreening System (Promega). The 200,000 unamplified recombinant clones were screened with the polyclonal anti-Estα21 esterase antisera at a dilution of 1:10,000. Positive clones were purified by successive rounds of screening and in vivo excised to give recombinant pBluescript plasmids. Sequencing was carried out with Sequenase Version 2.0 (Amersham Corp.) using universal primers complemented with the ExoIII/Mung Bean Nuclease deletion method (Stratagene) and with primers specific to the estα21 clone. This allowed the sequencing of both strands of the insert cDNA from the plasmid. A modified 5′-RACE procedure as performed previously (17Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was used to isolate the full-length estα2 1The abbreviations used are: RACErapid amplification of cDNA endsPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase. cDNA. The reverse primer used in the PCR was 5′-ACCGTACATCTCCACTCC-3′ and was close to the 5′-end of the cDNA isolated from the cDNA library. The PCR product was subcloned into the pBluescript T vector(17Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Two separate PCR products were sequenced in both directions. rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction kilobase. A Pel RR estα21 cDNA fragment was used as a probe to determine the haplotype of the Estα esterases from the Pel RR and Pel SS strains. Genomic DNA was isolated from fourth instar larvae as described previously(17Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 10 μg of genomic DNA was digested to completion with EcoRI and separated by gel electrophoresis through 0.8% (w/v) agarose. The DNA was transferred to charged nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.) and hybridized with a 32P-labeled Estα21 cDNA probe (specific activity > 2 × 106 cpm/μg) at 65°C for 16 h in hybridization buffer (5 × Denhardt's solution, 6 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) sodium pyrophosphate, 5% (w/v) PEG 8000, and 100 μg/ml boiled, sheared herring sperm DNA). The final washes were at 65°C in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 20 min. Similarity searches of protein data bases with the the estα21 cDNA sequence were undertaken using the B17049 and MPsearch programs available through NCBI (National Institutes of Health) and EMBL (Heidelberg), respectively. Family structure determination was undertaken using the Prosite section of the Motif finder program through the Motif E-mail server on Genome. Prediction of secondary structure was undertaken using the PHD program(28Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were undertaken using the MegAlign program of the LASERGENE package (DNASTAR). Similarity indexes were calculated using the FASTA algorithm, via the GeneMan program of LASERGENE. Four positive plaques were obtained from the initial screening of the 200,000 recombinant clones of the unamplified Pel RR cDNA library. The number of positives obtained from this screening suggested that the target sequence was initially present at a higher frequency than that expected for a single copy gene. The four plaques were purified, in vivo excised, and partially sequenced with M13 forward and reverse primers. The sequence for all four clones over 400 nucleotides was identical. The insert from one of the plasmids (pBlueAV.A2) was completely sequenced in both directions. The cDNA sequence had an open reading frame at its 5′-end, and terminated in a stop codon, 3′-untranslated region, and a poly(A) tail. There was no start methionine codon (AUG), so a modified 5′-RACE procedure (17Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was used to isolate the 5′-end of the cDNA. The sequence of the two subcloned 5′-RACE PCR products analyzed was identical in both directions and also overlapped exactly with the previously sequenced partial length cDNA clone. The full-length cDNA (made up of the insert from pBlueAV.A2 and the 5′-RACE PCR product) had an open reading frame of 1623 base pairs complete with an AUG start codon and coded for a protein of 540 amino acids. This is in the expected range, since the purified monomeric protein has an estimated molecular mass of 58-67 kDa estimated by SDS-PAGE, native PAGE, and Sephacryl S200 chromatography(29Ketterman A.J. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the full-length estα21 cDNA nucleotide sequence and the proposed amino acid sequence. Fig. 2 shows the predicted amino acid sequence of Estα21 and its alignment with the Culex Estβ21 (Pel RR B2) and aphid E4 amplified esterases. The Estα21 sequence, like the Estβ21, contained nine cysteine residues, but only three of these are conserved between the two esterases. The triad of precisely located active site amino acids, Ser, Glu, and His, of the serine esterase family were present in the Estα21 sequence at positions 190, 324, and 445, respectively.Figure 2:Alignment of the amino acid sequence of Culex mosquito serine Estα21 and Estβ21 esterases with the aphid E4 esterase involved in insecticide resistance. Possible glycosylation sites are underlined. Conserved amino acids in a large range of esterases (30) are in boldface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The estα21 had a similarity index of 49.2 with estβ21, which was the highest similarity in the protein database. The top 30 alignments of estα21 undertaken with both the B17049 and MPsearch programs were all esterases or lipases. The protein was also unambiguously assigned to the carboxylesterase B-1 family of B type serine esterases using the Motif program. Possible N-linked glycosylation sites, conforming to the sequence NXT or NXS, where X is not proline are underlined in Fig. 2. There are only two possible glycosylation sites in estα21; both are very close to the active site serine and are not shared by other esterases in the alignment. Since the estα21 is not proceeded by a signal sequence, and as the purified mature protein is not retained by Con A chromatography(22Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Characterization of Multiple Variants of Carboxylesterases Which Are Involved in Insecticide Resistance in the Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. Ph.D. thesis, University of London. 1994; Google Scholar), it is probable that the protein is not glycosylated. The predicted secondary structure of Estα21 obtained using the PHD program (28Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) is given in Fig. 3 compared with the known consensus secondary structure of the Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase and Geotrichum candidum lipase(30Cygler M. Schrag J.D. Sussman J.L. Harel M. Silman I. Gentry M.K. Doctor B.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 366-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The predicted secondary structures of the Estα21 and Estβ21 proteins, determined independently, were identical with the exception of the final α-helix, which was not predicted in Estβ21. The predicted secondary structure is remarkably similar to that of the known consensus sequence for serine esterases and lipases, differing only in three α-helices. One of these, the helix between β-sheets 8 and 9 is also present in the G. candidum lipase structure but is not present in T. californica acetylcholinesterase (30). The estα21 cDNA was used as a probe for Southern blot analysis of EcoRI restriction digests of equal amounts of genomic DNA from the insecticide-susceptible (Pel SS) and resistant (Pel RR) mosquito strains. After hybridization and high stringency washing, the probe bound to a single 7.4-kb band of Pel SS DNA (Fig. 4), which demonstrates the existence of an estα gene with high homology to estα21 in this strain. A 7.5-kb band was found in the resistant strain at an equally low intensity, suggesting that the resistant strain still carries a nonamplified estα allele. The Pel RR strain contained a 5.8-kb band with a high signal intensity, which was not present in the Pel SS strain. The higher signal intensity in the resistant strain compared with the susceptible, implies that gene amplification is the underlying mechanism of the Estα21-associated resistance. Further proof of this was obtained by undertaking dot blots with the estα21 cDNA probe, using genomic DNA from four other resistant strains of C. quinquefasciatus from different geographical locations with elevated Estα2 activity. All the resistant strains gave a much higher intensity of signal than the susceptible strain (Pel SS), and the signals obtained were similar when the blots were reprobed with an estβ21 cDNA. This suggests that the amplification levels of the estα2 and estβ2 genes are similar in the resistant strains. In this paper a new Culex esterase nomenclature system (17) has been adopted, as the molecular data now accumulating is making the old system unworkable. For example, a nonamplified B esterase from a susceptible Culex strain, which has an identical electrophoretic mobility to B1, has been shown to be distinct from the B1s from TemR and MRES, which are in turn distinct from each other, and from esterase B2 at both a kinetic and amino acid level(17Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).2 2S. H. P. P. Karunaratne, K. G. I. Jayawardena, A. Vaughan, and J. Hemingway, submitted for publication. Thus on the basis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns, DNA sequences, inferred amino acid sequences, and kinetic interactions of these enzymes at least one nonamplified and two amplified “B1” esterases occur(17Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).3 3G. J. Small, S. H. P. P. Karunaratne, and J. Hemingway, submitted for publication. This level of variability of electrophoretically identical esterases makes application of the earlier classification difficult, and the problem has been compounded by electrophoretically similar esterases being given different numerical values on the basis of their distinct RFLP patterns(31Poire M. Raymond M. Pasteur N. Biochem. Genet. 1992; 30: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The nomenclature system we have used allows preliminary assignment of the esterase by electrophoresis, with an extension when sequence data is available, while the old system means esterases may need complete reclassification once sequence or RFLP data is available. With the new classification the esterase that we have now cloned, which was previously referred to as A2, is classified as Estα21 on the basis of its electrophoretic mobility and sequence. The estα21 esterase cDNA from the insecticide-resistant Pel RR strain of the C. quinquefasciatus mosquito has now been cloned and sequenced. The high number of positive clones obtained from the initial screening of the cDNA library suggested either that there was increased transcription of the gene or that gene amplification was the underlying mechanism of increased esterase activity. Southern blot analysis showed that the resistant strain had a unique, amplified 5.8-kb EcoRI RFLP when compared with the susceptible strain, which had a single unamplified band at 7.4 kb. Amplification of the estα2 gene was also shown in other C. quinquefasciatus strains with elevated Estα2 and Estβ2 activity, using dot blot analysis of genomic DNA. Since amplification of estβ2 is already well documented(17Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the underlying genetic mechanism for organophosphorus insecticide resistance in mosquitoes with the elevated Estα2/Estβ2 activity phenotype is therefore amplification of both esterase genes. The different RFLP pattern for estα in the Pel RR and Pel SS strains demonstrates the existence of two distinct estα alleles. The amplified and nonamplified Estα and Estβ esterases have been purified and characterized physically and kinetically from a range of insecticide-resistant strains and a susceptible strain of mosquito(28Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 32Jayawardena K.G.I. Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Ketterman A.J. Hemingway J. Bull. Entomol.

G. I. Jayawardena, A. Vaughan, and J. Hemingway, submitted for publication. The Estα enzymes from the susceptible (Pel SS) and resistant (Pel RR) strains are kinetically and electrophoretically distinct from each other,2 suggesting that they are different alleles, which is supported by the different RFLP patterns seen in the two strains. The amplified Estα21, Estβ12, and Estβ21 esterases all have similar sizes (∼60 kDa) and PI values(29Ketterman A.J. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Ketterman A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).3 We now know that all three esterases are coded for by cDNAs with the same length open reading frame. The amplified esterases E4 and FE4 in insecticide-resistant aphids are comparable in function and size with the mosquito esterases, but unlike the Culex esterases these enzymes confer resistance to both organophosphates and pyrethroids(35Devonshire A.L. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 36Devonshire A.L. Moores G.D. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 18: 235-246Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 37Devonshire A.L. Moores G.D. Reiner E. Aldridge W.N. Hoskin F.C.G. Enzymes Hydrolysing Organophosphorus Compounds. Ellis Horwood Chichester, UK1989: 181-192Google Scholar). The E4 esterase and the Estα21 and various Estβ Culex esterases all produce resistance to the organophosphates by sequestration, although the aphid and mosquito Estα and Estβ esterases share only 21.8 and 22.9% similarity, respectively, while the similarity of the mosquito esterases is 49.2%. Hence the same kinetic properties can clearly be conferred by a large number of different sequences. This is perhaps not surprising when the predicted secondary structures of these esterases are considered. The predicted secondary structures for the Estα21 and Estβ21 esterases differ only in the final element, and the structure bears a striking resemblance to actual secondary structures already resolved for two members of the serine esterase/lipase family(30Cygler M. Schrag J.D. Sussman J.L. Harel M. Silman I. Gentry M.K. Doctor B.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 366-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The high level of amino acid identity of Estα21 and Estβ21 suggests that they originated from a common ancestor. The two genes probably arose through gene duplication and subsequently diversified. The Culex esterase cDNAs each code for proteins of 540 amino acids, and they have a higher sequence homology with each other than for any other sequence within the data banks. The two esterases also share a number of common features. For example, many carboxylesterases contain a short hydrophobic leader sequence, which initially directs protein sorting down a secretory pathway. All sequenced human liver carboxylesterases and the aphid E4 carboxylesterase contain signal sequences of between 17 and 23 amino acids(38Field L.M. Williamson M.S. Moores G.D. Devonshire A.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 39Kroetz D.L. McBride O.W. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11606-11617Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mosquito estα21 sequence and the estβ21 sequence are relatively unusual in that they contain no signal sequence, suggesting that neither esterase is exported from the cell. Neither of these purified esterases bind to Con A chromatography columns(22Karunaratne S.H.P.P. Characterization of Multiple Variants of Carboxylesterases Which Are Involved in Insecticide Resistance in the Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. Ph.D. thesis, University of London. 1994; Google Scholar), which suggests that the esterases are not glycosylated, in contrast to the aphid and some human esterases(39Kroetz D.L. McBride O.W. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11606-11617Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 40Devonshire A.L. Searle L.M. Moores G.D. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 659-665Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This is further supported by the sequence data, since there are only two possible N-linked glycosylation sites on the Estα21 esterase, which are situated only 4 and 31 amino acids from the active site serine. In many soluble carboxylesterases that are retained by the endoplasmic reticulum, the tetrapeptide KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) occurs at the carboxyl terminus(41Pelham H.R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Variants of the KDEL sequence that direct intracellular retention of proteins have since been identified, although it appears that the Glu-Leu is a major requirement(42Robbi M. Beaufay H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The four Culex estβ cDNAs sequenced to date all end in the sequence NDELF. However, the carboxyl terminus of Estα21 is KDKLY. Twenty-three amino acids are conserved through a series of 29 related proteins, and it was argued that these amino acids are essential for the structure (salt bridges, packing, and disulfide bridges) and function (active site) of the proteins(30Cygler M. Schrag J.D. Sussman J.L. Harel M. Silman I. Gentry M.K. Doctor B.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 366-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Only 21 of these are conserved in the Estα21. A cysteine is one of the nonconserved residues, and it is notable that both the Estα21 and Estβ21 have nine cysteine residues, the majority of which are not conserved in any other serine esterase. The missing cysteine, at position 65 (Cys61 and Cys67 in T. californica AChE and G. candidum lipase, respectively) in the Pel RR Estα21 sequence, forms a disulfide bridge in T. californica acetylcholinesterase and G. candidum lipase with a cysteine at position 84 (Cys105 and Cys94), which is a serine in the Estα21 and various Estβ Culex esterases. In the alignment of Cygler et al.(30Cygler M. Schrag J.D. Sussman J.L. Harel M. Silman I. Gentry M.K. Doctor B.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 366-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), the only esterase in which the latter cysteine was not conserved was the Culex TemR Estβ11. The reason for the large number of cysteines in the Culex esterases is unknown, but it has been suggested that five of these may not be involved in disulfide bond formation, leaving them free to oxidize. This results in the development of evenly spaced satellite bands after native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified native esterases under buffer conditions that do not protect the thiol groups(43Jayawardena K.G.I. Hemingway J. Med. Vet. Entomol. 1995; 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Having shown that the mechanism of elevation of the Estα21 esterase is gene amplification, we now intend to determine the genomic structure of this esterase. The almost complete linkage disequilibrium in which these two elevated esterases occur, coupled with their sequence similarities, indicating that they arose through gene duplication, may also suggest that the two esterases are situated on the same amplification unit. This has, however, been contradicted by some classical genetic data on the inheritance patterns of these esterases,(12Callaghan A. Hemingway J. Malcolm C.A. Biochem. Genet. 1993; 31: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 44Wirth M.C. Marquine M. Georghiou G.P. Pasteur N. J. Med. Entomol. 1990; 27: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the final determination of the physical location of the two esterases in relation to each other awaits further genomic studies."

However, based on sequence analyses and observations that it may bind to steroid receptors and integrins and store Ca2+ within the cell, it has been postulated to play a “housekeeping” role. To determine whether the level of expression of CRT is affected by stress, we examined the heat shock response of CRT from a variety of cultured cells, including vascular endothelial, lung epithelial, and lung fibroblasts. Following exposure of the cells to 42°C, CRT mRNA transiently accumulated 2.5-4.2-fold at 1-6 h. Nuclear run-on studies and mRNA stability experiments confirmed that the predominant mechanism of augmentation was transcriptional. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays further indicated that the promoter region, containing a putative heat shock element between −172 and −158 of the human CRT gene, is heat shock-sensitive. Finally, we demonstrated the in vivo significance of these findings by exposing rats to hyperthermia. This resulted in accumulation of CRT mRNA and an augmentation of CRT protein in lung tissue. We hypothesize that this stress-induced up-regulation of CRT contributes to the mechanism(s) by which the vascular endothelium and lung tissue, and possibly other organ systems, maintain homeostasis when exposed to a variety of pathophysiological conditions.

Based on Ca2+-binding properties of the protein, CRT has been proposed by several laboratories to be a major Ca2+-binding/storage protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (9). The protein has two distinct Ca2+-binding sites (high affinity/low capacity and low affinity/high capacity)(13Baksh S. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21458-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent investigations have indicated that CRT might also be important in protein-protein interactions within the cell. Guan et al. (15) reported a tight association of flavin-containing lung monooxygenases with CRT, while Rojiani and co-workers (16Rojiani M. Finlay B. Gray V. Dedhar S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9859-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) demonstrated interactions between the integrin α subunit and CRT. A set of endoplasmic reticulum proteins has also been identified that interact with CRT(17Burns K. Michalak M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Burns et al.(18Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E. Famulski K. Nemer M. Bleackley R. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and Dedhar et al.(19Dedhar S. Rennie P. Shago M. Hagesteijn C.-Y. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matusik R. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that CRT may interact with steroid hormone receptors leading to the modulation of their transcriptional activity. Finally, CRT has also been implicated to play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders(10McCauliffe D. Zappi E. Lieu T.-S. Michalak M. Sontheimer R. Capra J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 332-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Rokeach L. Haselby J. Meilof J. Smeenk R. Unnasch T. Greene B. Hoch S. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3031-3039PubMed Google Scholar). Although analysis of the promoter region of the human CRT gene (11McCauliffe D. Yang Y. Wilson J. Sontheimer R. Capra J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has revealed several potential sites that may play an important role in its transcriptional regulation, none of these have been functionally defined. CRT is reported to be augmented in response to cellular proliferation(21Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Gersten D. Bijwaard K. Law L. Hearing V. Biochim. Biophys.

Virol. 1993; 67: 3427-3434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may be released from activated neutrophils(25Eggleton P. Lieu T. Zappi E. Sastry K. Coburn J. Zaner K. Sontheimer R. Capra J. Ghebrehiwet B. Tauber A. Clin. Immunol. Immunopath. 1994; 72: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Other investigations have indicated that CRT is a major prompt glycosylation protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells in response to heat shock(26Jethmalani S. Henle K. Kaushal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23603-23609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate, using Northern analyses, mRNA stability measurements, and nuclear run-on assays, that heat shock also up-regulates CRT expression in cultured cells predominantly via transcriptional mechanisms. Furthermore, CAT assays support our hypothesis that the promoter region of the CRT gene containing a putative heat shock element (HSE) is sensitive to heat shock stress. Finally, utilizing rats exposed to heat shock stress, we demonstrate that both the transcriptional and post-translational glycosylation responses are active in vivo. These results, and recent observations indicating the in vivo protective role of heat shock in sepsis-induced lung injury(27Ribeiro S. Villar J. Downey G. Edelson J. Slutsky A. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 22: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Villar J. Ribeiro S. Brendan J. Mullen J. Kulixzewski M. Post M. Slutsky A. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 22: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), suggest that stress-induced CRT up-regulation may be important in a variety of biological systems and pathophysiologic conditions. Goat-anti-rabbit CRT antibodies have been fully characterized (3Milner R. Baksh S. Shemanko C. Carpenter M. Smillie L. Vance J. Opas M. Michalak M. J. Biol.

Restriction enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim Canada (Dorval, Quebec). 32P-Labeled nucleotides were purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Canada). RNase T1, yeast tRNA, and DNase 1 were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, Ontario, Canada); NTPs were from Pharmacia Biotech. Inc. (Baie d'Urfe, Quebec, Canada); and endothelial cell mitogen was from Biomedical Technologies Inc. (Stoughton, MA). HUVEC were harvested by the method of Jaffe et al.(29Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar), grown, and characterized as reported previously (30). Experiments were performed on cells between passages 2 and 5. The immortalized human microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 were kindly provided by the Biological Products Branch of the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA) and cultured as reported(31Ades E. Candal F. Swerlick R. George V. Summers S. Bosse D. Lawley T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hooper W. Phillips D. Ribeiro M. Benson J. George V. Ades E. Evatt B. Blood. 1994; 84: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells, SKLU-1 human epithelial lung cancer cells, and MRC-5 human diploid fibroblasts (passage 25-30) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Media was changed 24 h prior to all experiments. For the purposes of heat shock, the cell monolayers were first grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37°C and were transferred to another humidified, water-jacketed incubator preset at 42°C. The incubator was regulated to stay within 0.2°C of the target temperature. At the appropriate time points, the cells were immediately placed on ice, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and used for membrane preparations, RNA isolations, or nuclear extractions for run-on assays. The full-length 1.9-kilobase cDNA encoding human CRT (33McCauliffe D. Lux F. Lieu T.-S. Sanz I. Hanke J. Newkirk M. Bachinski L. Itoh Y. Siciliano M. Reichlin M. Sontheimer R. Capra J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1379-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. R. Sontheimer (South West Medical Center, Dallas, Texas). The plasmid pGAD28 containing the cDNA for the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was provided by Dr. Robert J. Schwartz, Houston, TX(34Dugaiczyk A. Haron J. Stone E. Dennison O. Rothblum K. Schwartz R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and the cDNA encoding the human heat shock protein HSP70 was obtained from Dr. Jack Hensold, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH. Plasmids were purified by alkaline lysis and CsCl gradient centrifugation(35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Following purification from low melting point agarose gels, the entire 1.9-kilobase cDNA of CRT, the 547-base pair HindIII-XbaI fragment from the coding region of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and a 2.3-kilobase BamHI-HindIII fragment encoding HSP70 were used as probes for Northern blots after labeling with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer synthesis method (36). The specific activity of the probes was approximately 2 × 106 cpm/ng of DNA. For nuclear run-on experiments, the above cDNA inserts were subcloned into the plasmid Bluescript (pBS) (Stratagene), and 10 μg of each were dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose for each condition (see below). Total RNA was isolated from confluent cell monolayers by the method of Chomczynski et al.(37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Northern analyses were performed as described previously(38Conway E. Nowakowski B. Blood. 1993; 81: 726-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the t of a specific mRNA, postconfluent cells were exposed to actinomycin D, 25 μg/ml, in culture media for varying periods of time, after which the cells were lysed for Northern analysis. Actinomycin D at this concentration totally inhibited transcription as evaluated by nuclear run-on experiments (data not shown). Densitometry was performed on scanned autoradiographs (MacIntosh Color OneScanner) using the NIH Image Analysis Version 1.52 computer program for the MacIntosh. To obtain the CRT promoter region with the putative heat shock element included, genomic DNA was prepared from approximately 4 × 106 second passage HUVEC. The following oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to span the region from −223 to 22(11McCauliffe D. Yang Y. Wilson J. Sontheimer R. Capra J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) : 1) 5′-gcgtggtcgaccatcat; 2) 5′-cgatctagagcggctctgcagt. Primer 1 is the upstream sense strand, while primer 2 is the anti-parallel strand between the transcription and translation start sites and has an XbaI site added to provide for easier subcloning. To 1 μg of each of the primers, polymerase chain reaction buffer was added to a final concentration of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin. After heating to 94°C, Taq polymerase, 2.5 units (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Mississauga, Canada), was added to initiate the reaction, and amplification was performed for 30 cycles, with 1-min primer extensions at 72°C, denaturation for 30 s at 94°C, and primer annealings for 30 s at 45°C. The resultant 261-base pair fragment was digested with SalI and XbaI and subcloned into pBS, and the nucleotide sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The CRT promoter region was then subcloned into pCAT-Basic vector (pCAT-BV) (Promega), the latter, which contains the CAT gene, in the appropriate orientation, to yield pCRT-CAT for CAT assays. pCAT-BV lacks eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences, and expression of functional CAT activity in transfected cells depends on the insertion of a functional promoter within the multiple cloning sequence. Preconfluent cells in 100-mm dishes were washed twice with serum-free medium, OPTI-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfection was accomplished by overnight incubation at 37°C of a mixture containing 20 μg of the CAT vector, 20 μg of pSVTKGH(39Selden R. Rowe M. Goodman H. Moore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and 25 μg of lipofectin in a total volume of 1.5 ml of OPTI-MEM. pSVTKGH contains the thymidine kinase promoter, an SV40 enhancer, and the human growth hormone gene. The cells were then fed with 5 ml of fresh growth medium, 48 h after which heat shock experiments were started. Following heat shock stress, the cells were immediately put on ice, and the medium was carefully removed for quantitation of growth hormone levels by a nonisotopic immunoassay (system 9670SA from Life Technologies, Inc.). The cell monolayers were washed 3 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and pelleted, and lysates were prepared by four freeze-thaw cycles, after which they were heated at 60°C for 10 min. CAT reactions using [3H]chloramphenicol were performed overnight at 37°C in duplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Transfections with pCAT-BV or without any CAT vector yielded similar (± 5%) background tritium counts. Experiments were performed 3 times, and after subtracting the background counts as determined from parallel transfections with pCAT-BV, the results were corrected for transfection efficiency by dividing by the respective growth hormone levels as determined by the immunoassay. Following heat shock, nuclear pellets from approximately 5 × 107 cells/sample were prepared, and nuclear run-on assays were performed as previously reported(40Conway E. Liu L. Nowakowski B. Steiner-Mosonyi M. Jackman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22804-22810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled RNA specifically bound to the filters was visualized by autoradiography. Nonspecific hybridization was determined to be negligible as assessed by using filters dot-blotted with 10 μg of pBS. All animal experiments and treatments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Toronto. Sprague-Dawley rats, 250-300 g (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), were anesthetized with pentobarbital 35 mg/kg intraperitoneally and placed into a prewarmed 41 ± 0.5°C ambient temperature, humidified neonatal incubator (Isolette infant incubator, Air-Shields Inc., Harboro, PA). The temperature of each animal, which was continuously monitored by rectal thermometer, persistently increased until it reached 41°C (1-1.5 h). Fifteen minutes later, while maintaining a temperature between 41 and 42.5°C, the animals were transferred to room temperature (21°C), from which point the post-heat shock duration was determined. Sham-treated rats were also anesthetized but were not exposed to hyperthermia. The temperatures of these rats dropped from a mean of 37.5-36.1 ± 0.5°C 1 h after anesthesia administration and returned to baseline within 4-6 h. At the end of the post-heat shock period, the rats were sacrificed by sodium pentobarbital overdose. Thoracotomy was performed, and the lungs were resected and immediately inserted into liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for further processing. Samples were subsequently homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblotting or lysed in 4 M guanidium isothiocyanate solution (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) for total RNA preparation and Northern blot analyses. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Richmond, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes were carried out as described earlier(38Conway E. Nowakowski B. Blood. 1993; 81: 726-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CRT was identified with the goat anti-CRT antibodies by overnight incubation at room temperature in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 5% Carnation milk and detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody. Statistical analyses were conducted by standard techniques with the aid of StatView computer program for the MacIntosh (Abacus Concepts Inc., CA). The means are provided with associated standard deviations (S.D.). Fig. 1 shows the Northern blot analysis of CRT mRNA in heat-shocked HUVEC. Following continuous growth of the cells at 37°C to a postconfluent state, the HUVEC were transferred to an incubator preset at 42°C, while control cell monolayers were maintained at 37°C. The specific mRNA for CRT had risen approximately 4.2-fold (see Fig. 3) following 6 h of heat shock as quantitated by densitometry, and, although some attenuation was noted, an elevation was maintained for at least 36 h during continuous heat stress. The pattern of rise of CRT mRNA was similar to that seen with HSP70 mRNA expression under the same stress conditions (Fig. 1). HSP70 mRNA levels were undetectable under nonstress conditions, but increased over 100-fold from 1.5 to 6 h following heat shock. mRNA levels of the “housekeeping” gene, glyceraldehyde-phosphate-3′-dehydrogenase, were unaltered by the stress, indicating the specific nature of the heat shock response (Fig. 1) and equal loading of total RNA/lane.Figure 3:mRNA levels of CRT from different cells exposed to 42°C heat shock. Postconfluent cells (HMEC-1, HUVEC, A549, SKLU-1, MRC-5) were exposed to continuous heat shock for 0-24 h, and 10 μg of total RNA from each sample were separated on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose. Northern blot analyses were performed, detecting with radiolabeled cDNA probes for CRT and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Densitometry was performed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” and CRT mRNA levels were quantitated relative to the non-heat shocked levels (100%) and corrected for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels at each time point. The results reflect the mean of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the specificity of the heat shock response by exposing other cultured cells to hyperthermia. These included human lung epithelial carcinoma A549 cells, human lung adenocarcinoma SKLU-1 cells, an immortalized line of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1)(31Ades E. Candal F. Swerlick R. George V. Summers S. Bosse D. Lawley T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hooper W. Phillips D. Ribeiro M. Benson J. George V. Ades E. Evatt B. Blood. 1994; 84: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and human diploid lung fibroblasts. Although variabilities in the rate and degree of response were observed, specific CRT mRNA levels in each of these cell lines as evaluated by Northern blot analyses (Fig. 2) and densitometry (Fig. 3) rose 2.5-3.6-fold following 1.5-6 h of exposure to hyperthermia and, in all but the A549 cells, remained elevated at 24 h. These results suggested that the factors active in up-regulating transcription of the CRT gene are not specific to a single cell type but rather are probably functional in most cell biologic systems. Given the above results, we determined whether alterations in CRT mRNA stability were contributing to the heat shock-induced augmentation in expression. This was done by evaluating the effect of hyperthermia on actinomycin D-induced, time-dependent decrease in CRT mRNA. Postconfluent HUVEC were incubated at either 37 or 42°C in the presence or absence of the RNA polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D, 25 μg/ml, at which dose the incorporation of [3H]thymidine was suppressed by over 95% within 30 min of exposure, and in vitro transcription was abrogated. In a representative experiment, densitometry analyses of the Northern blots shown in Fig. 4 indicated that the t of CRT mRNA when the cells were maintained at 37°C was 8 h, while the t when the cells were exposed to heat shock was 7.5 h. The lack of a significant alteration in the stability of the CRT mRNA by heat shock, suggested that the major mechanism of up-regulation of the message was via transcription. We directly evaluated the in vitro transcriptional response of CRT to heat shock stress by performing nuclear run-on studies. HSP70 transcripts from HUVEC maintained at 37°C were almost undetectable. Transcription of the HSP70 gene was augmented over 100-fold by the 42°C heat shock (Fig. 5) in a similar kinetic pattern of expression as its specific mRNA (Fig. 1). CRT gene transcription was also up-regulated 3.5-fold by the 42°C heat shock stress within 90 min as quantitated by densitometry (Fig. 5) and relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene transcription. This was followed by gradual attenuation over the ensuing 24 h. These findings were consistent with the Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1-3) and also supportive of a predominantly transcriptional response of the CRT gene to the stress. On examination of the promoter region of the human CRT gene between −172 and −158(11McCauliffe D. Yang Y. Wilson J. Sontheimer R. Capra J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have identified a putative HSE composed of three inverted repeats of the consensus pentad nGAAn (Fig. 6). This region may provide a site of interaction with heat shock transcription factors (41Pelham H. Cell. 1982; 30: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 42Mirault M. Southgate R. Delwart E. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 43Xiao H. Perisic O. Lis J.

Cell. 1989; 59: 797-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) to mediate the observed heat shock sensitivity of CRT. The putative HSE within the CRT gene was therefore examined for response to heat shock by inserting the region from −223 to 22 in front of a CAT construct (pCRT-CAT). A549 cells were transfected with the pCRT-CAT or pCAT-BV, the latter as a negative control, and exposed to 37 or 42°C for varying periods of time. Growth hormone assays and transfections with pCAT-BV were performed to correct the CAT activity results for transfection efficiency and nonspecific background as detailed in the methods. As seen in Table I, pCRT-CAT expression was augmented by over 3-fold following 5 h of heat shock stress, indicating that the promoter region containing the putative HSE is important for heat shock sensitivity of the CRT gene.Table I:CAT activity of CRT promoter in A549 cells Open table in a new tab In order to confirm that the CRT gene is up-regulated in vivo, we exposed anesthetized rats normally maintained at room temperature (21°C) to heat shock. Immediately following anesthesia, rats were exposed to an ambient temperature of 41°C for 60-90 min until the rectal temperature reached 41-42.5°C for 15 min. The heat-shocked rats (n = 5) were then returned to room temperature during which time the rectal temperature dropped to 38.6 ± 0.3 and 37.8 ± 0.6°C at 30 and 60 min post-heat shock, respectively. The rectal temperatures all returned to base line within 90 min, and no episodes of hypothermia were documented for 18 h post-heat shock. Consequently, the rats were hyperthermic for a total duration of approximately 2-3.5 h. 12 and 18 h post-heat shock exposure, the rats were sacrificed for lung tissue analyses. Control sham-treated animals were not exposed to heat stress but did develop transient hypothermia to a mean minimum temperature of 36.1°C 1 h following the anesthesia. Rectal temperatures of these animals were also normal by 4-6 h after administration of anesthesia. Fig. 7(top) is a Western immunoblot depicting total CRT expression within the lung tissue as a result of heat shock. In this representative experiment, lung-derived CRT was notably increased 12 and 18 h following heat shock, as compared with that from the sham-treated control animal or animals not exposed to heat shock or anesthesia (not shown). Furthermore, a second larger band detected by the specific anti-CRT antibodies was also evident in the immunoblot, consistent with heat shock-induced glycosylation of CRT observed in vitro by other investigators(26Jethmalani S. Henle K. Kaushal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23603-23609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in expression of CRT protein was paralleled by a persistent increase by 3-fold (by densitometry) in specific CRT mRNA (Fig. 7) from the same tissue samples. We can conclude, therefore, that heat shock stress induces transcription and translation of CRT that is not only manifested in cell culture but that is also evident in vivo. In this report, we have shown that heat shock results in increased expression of CRT predominantly at the level of transcription. The physiological significance of this finding was confirmed by in vivo experiments; CRT mRNA and protein are elevated in the lung tissue of heat-shocked rats. Additionally, the previously observed early glycosylation response of CRT to hyperthermia (26Jethmalani S. Henle K. Kaushal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23603-23609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also evident in our in vivo experiments. In response to heat shock, CRT transcription transiently increased 3-4-fold followed by a recovery phase in which gene transcription attenuated and eventually returned toward pre-heat shock levels. The ubiquitous nature of this CRT response was evident from our observation that different cells (HUVEC, A549, SKLU-1, MRC-5, and HMEC) responded to the stress by enhancing transcription of the CRT gene and accumulation of its mRNA. Our data further suggested that a major mechanism of CRT mRNA accumulation as depicted in the Northern blots, was via enhanced transcription, with little or no contribution from alterations in message stability. Opas et al.(21Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) previously reported that in a cultured rat myogenic cell line, heat shock of 45°C for 3 h followed by return to 37°C for 2-48 h did not result in an increase in the levels of CRT protein. Indeed, a transient reduction in CRT was observed during the recovery phase between 6 and 8 h. The apparent discordance of our results with those of Opas et al.(21Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) might be explained by the use of different cultured cells or alternatively by the high temperature used in their experiments, which may have abrogated the transcriptional response. This possibility is consistent with observations that the transcriptional response of some “classic” heat shock proteins may be suppressed, and indeed diminished, by particularly large increases in temperature(45Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human CRT gene has recently been cloned(11McCauliffe D. Yang Y. Wilson J. Sontheimer R. Capra J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several putative regulatory sequences were identified using human HeLa cell nuclear extracts, gel mobility shift analyses, and DNA footprint localization studies. The possibility that CRT might provide a housekeeping function similar to the role of other “chaperones” was clearly recognized by these investigators(11McCauliffe D. Yang Y. Wilson J. Sontheimer R. Capra J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our analysis of the region between −172 and −158 of the human CRT gene revealed the presence of a putative HSE. Strong biochemical evidence indicates that this sequence motif, i.e. arrays of two or more inverted repeats of the five-base pair sequence nGAAn, provides a site of interaction with heat shock transcription factors. The arrays may function even with imperfect five-base pair units where there are substitutions for some of the consensus GAA bases (41Pelham H. Cell. 1982; 30: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 42Mirault M. Southgate R. Delwart E. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 43Xiao H. Perisic O. Lis J. Cell. 1991; 64: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or if the repeats are variably oriented (44). As noted in Fig. 6, the identified consensus sequence, gGAAccCAGcgTTCc, within the 5′-flanking region of the CRT gene, has two perfect inverted repeats with an intervening imperfect pentad. We propose that this putative HSE in the CRT gene may be responsible for heat shock-dependent expression of CRT via transcriptional mechanisms. Our CAT assays support this hypothesis. However, further CAT studies using genetically altered DNA sequences within the putative HSE are indicated for confirmation as to the significance of this region. Furthermore, although the HSE may confer stress inducibility, the multiple putative cis- and/or trans-regulatory elements (11McCauliffe D. Yang Y. Wilson J. Sontheimer R. Capra J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may also confer a range of transcriptional responses, and consequently the kinetics and magnitude of DNA binding of heat shock transcription factors to the HSE may be regulated(46Morimoto R. Sarge K. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSPs, often referred to as molecular chaperones, are currently believed to function as protectors of cells from harmful effects of a variety of stresses and represent one of the most conserved families of proteins in evolution (see Welch et al.(47Welch W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 1993; 339: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and Morimoto et al.(48Morimoto R. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar) for reviews). Following exposure of rats to heat stress for 2-3.5 h, we observed a persistent increase in lung CRT mRNA and protein, the latter characterized by the presence of an apparently alternatively glycosylated form(26Jethmalani S. Henle K. Kaushal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23603-23609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent in vivo studies have demonstrated the protective property of hyperthermia and heat shock proteins in sepsis-induced lung injury in rats (27Ribeiro S. Villar J. Downey G. Edelson J. Slutsky A. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 22: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Villar J. Ribeiro S. Brendan J. Mullen J. Kulixzewski M. Post M. Slutsky A. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 22: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and endotoxin-mediated mortality in mice(49Hotchkiss R. Nunnally I. Lindquist S. Taulien J. Perdrizet G. Karl I. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R1447-R1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings of an increase in CRT mRNA and protein in lung tissue following heat shock, and the persistence of this response several hours after the removal of the stress, suggests that CRT also may play a protective role during and following fever or a variety of other physiological stresses. Although CRT is ubiquitous to all cells except erythrocytes, our studies were restricted to vascular endothelial and lung-derived tissue and cells. We and others have recently suggested that the stress response may protect the vasculature by transcriptionally up-regulating important vascular endothelial cell proteins, including thrombomodulin (40), thrombospondin(50Ketis N. Lawler J. Hoover R. Karnovsky M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and HSP70(51Udelsman R. Blake M. Stagg C. Li D. Putney D. Holbrook N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that CRT may also contribute to this process in the vasculature. However, it should be noted that considerable variation in organ expression of HSP72 has been observed in studies by Hotchkiss et al.(49Hotchkiss R. Nunnally I. Lindquist S. Taulien J. Perdrizet G. Karl I. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R1447-R1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) when mice were exposed to heat shock and endotoxin. Consequently, further studies will be required to evaluate the organ and tissue specificity of the response of CRT to heat shock stress. The mechanism(s) by which CRT may play a physiologically protective role is currently unknown. In addition to its Ca2+-binding properties, CRT also interacts with the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor and other nuclear hormone receptors(18Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E. Famulski K. Nemer M. Bleackley R. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 19Dedhar S. Rennie P. Shago M. Hagesteijn C.-Y. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matusik R. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), inhibiting glucocorticoid-sensitive gene expression and retinoic acid-dependent differentiation. Consequently, stress-induced up-regulation of CRT could modulate the steroid sensitivity of different cells, thereby protecting cells/organisms from different stresses. This regulatory mechanism may therefore have far-reaching effects during a variety of physiological processes, including differentiation, development, and homeostasis. A549 cells were transiently co-transfected with pCRT-CAT and pSVTKGH as described in the methods, and exposed to either 37°C or 42°C for the noted times. Results with associated standard deviations reflect the average of 3 experiments each performed in duplicate, corrected for transfection efficiency, and relative to activity when cells were maintained at 37°C for the same period of time."

The fragments of this transporter have been detected upon immunoblotting employing several antibodies raised against sequences from this transporter. At the amino terminus, initially a fragment of an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa is generated. This fragment is subsequently cleaved to one of 16 kDa. The generation of these bands is greatly inhibited in the presence of lithium. Moreover, lithium abolishes the positive cooperative activation of the transporter by sodium. The generation of the 30- and 16-kDa fragments is accelerated in the presence of L-glutamate and other transportable analogues, provided sodium is present as well. The 30-kDa fragment also contains an epitope from the loop connecting the putative membrane-spanning α-helices 3 and 4. This epitope, in contrast with the amino-terminal one, is destroyed with time. The carboxyl-terminal epitope is predominantly located on a 43-kDa fragment which is slowly converted to one of 35 kDa. This conversion is not inhibited by lithium. It is, however, stimulated by L-glutamate and other transportable analogues, but only in sodium-containing media. Potassium also stimulates this conversion regardless of the presence of L-glutamate. The stimulation of generation of amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments by L-glutamate is not mimicked by the non-transportable analogue dihydrokainate. However, the analogue blocks the stimulation exerted by L-glutamate. In addition to new experimental information on the transporters topology, our observations provide novel information on the function of the GLT-1 transporter. Although lithium by itself does not sustain transport, it may occupy one of the sodium sites and be transported. Furthermore, the transporter-glutamate complex appears to exist in at least two states.

Furthermore, the transporter-glutamate complex appears to exist in at least two states. After the initial binding (suggested to be important for the decay of synaptic glutamate), it undergoes a conformational change which represents, or is tightly associated with, the transport step. Uptake of glutamate into nerve terminals and glial cells serves to keep its extracellular concentration below neurotoxic levels and helps in conjunction with diffusion to terminate its action in synaptic transmission (cf. 20Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar; 25Nicholls D.G. Attwell D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 462-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar; Mennerick and Zorumski, 1994; Tong and Jahr, 1994). The process is catalyzed by electrogenic sodium- and potassium-coupled L-glutamate transporters. Although not established definitely, the stoichiometry is likely to be two sodium ions accompanying each glutamate anion, while one potassium and one hydroxyl ion are transported out (Kanner and Sharon, 1978; 35Stallcup W.B.

These three glutamate transporters form a small family which also includes a sodium-coupled small neutral amino acid transporter (1Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Fairman W.A. Wu Y.-N. Murdoch G.H.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2391-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GLT-1 protein has been purified to near homogeneity and reconstituted (9Danbolt N.C. Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6734-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 10Danbolt N.C. Storm-Mathisen J. Kanner B.I. Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). It represents around 0.6% of the protein of crude synaptosomal fractions (9Danbolt N.C. Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6734-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and is exclusively located in fine astroglial process of rat brain (10Danbolt N.C. Storm-Mathisen J. Kanner B.I. Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The cloning and characterization of the human homologues of these proteins has recently been described (2Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative role of diffusion and uptake of L-glutamate in the determination of its time course in the synaptic cleft is a subject of intensive investigation (14Isaacson J.S. Nicoll R.A. J. Neurophys. 1993; 70: 2187-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar; 33Sarantis M. Ballerini L. Miller B. Silver R.A. Edwards M. Attwell D.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1195-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The turnover number of the transporter has been estimated to be only a few per second (21Kanner B.I. Sharon I. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3949-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This is much too slow to account for the decay of L-glutamate in hippocampal synapses (8Clements J.D. Lester R.A.J. Tong G. Jahr C.E. Westbrook G.L. Science. 1992; 258: 1498-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence indicates a possible role of glutamate reuptake in this process, and it was pointed out that the transporters could do so by binding the transmitter rapidly (39Tong G. Jahr C.E. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1195-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Binding of glutamate, a partial reaction of transport, could be much faster than the overall transport cycle. In order to probe the feasibility of this concept, we have investigated the conformational changes of the (Na++ K+)-coupled glutamate transporter GLT-1, expected to occur during its translocation cycle. Its susceptibility to trypsin, in the presence and absence of its substrates, was monitored using sequence-directed antibodies. Our data indicate that substrate binding causes changes in trypsin-sensitive sites throughout the protein and also provide the first experimental data on its topology. We provide evidence that there are at least two distinct transporter-glutamate complexes. In the first the position of glutamate can be occupied by the non-transportable analogue dihydrokainate. The transporter-glutamate complex, but not the transporter-dihydrokainate complex, can undergo a sodium-dependent conformational change which represents or is highly associated with the transport step.

Crude membrane vesicles (10-20 mg/ml) were rapidly thawed at 37°C in a water bath, and after addition of 10 ml of either of the following loading buffer the incubation was continued for 10 more min. The composition of these buffers was 135 mM NaCl and 10 mM NaPi, pH 7.4; 135 mM KCl and 10 mM KPi, pH 7.4; 135 mM LiCl and 10 mM LiPi pH 7.4; or 135 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM Tris-Pi, pH 7.4.

Subsequently, 30 μl of this suspension was diluted with 500 μl of the same solution with or without additions as detailed in the legends to the figures and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends, L-glutamate was used at 1 mM. Then, 40 μl of a freshly prepared trypsin solution (dissolved in water) was added such that the protein ratio trypsin/membrane vesicles was 1:5.

Immediately thereafter the mixture was diluted with 10 ml of ice-cold loading buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Zero time points were performed by adding the trypsin inhibitor prior to trypsin, followed by immediate dilution in the ice-cold stop solution. After centrifugation at 15,000 revolutions/min for 15 min, the pellets were washed with 10 ml of ice-cold sodium containing loading buffer and resuspended in the same buffer at a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. The membrane vesicles were then processed for immunoblotting or transport as described below. This was performed as described (31Reimerdes E.H. Klostermeyer H.

Antibodies were raised in rabbits against peptides corresponding to residues 17-32 (P-692, part of the amino terminus, RMHDSHLSSEEPKHRN), residues 151-167 (P-693, part of the putative external loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4, KQLGPGKKNDEVSSLDA), to residues 496-512 (P-694, part of the carboxyl terminus, SKSELDTISDQHRMHED). The protocol described (Mabjeesh and Kanner, 1992) was followed. The antisera were characterized against the HTP peak, a purified preparation of the L-glutamate transporter (9Danbolt N.C. Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6734-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). They were affinity purified on Affi-Gel 10 coupled to P-692 or to Affi-Gel 15 coupled to either P-693 or P-694. The antibodies were tested against membrane vesicles from rat brain, using a 1:300 dilution. The 73 kDa was the only band detected by the anti-P-692 and the anti P-693 antibodies. In the case of the anti-P-694 antibodies, a minor 35 kDa band was also revealed in some preparations, probably representing a proteolytic fragment of the transporter. The immunoreactivity of all the bands observed with the affinity purified antibodies was abolished by 50 nmol of the peptides used to raise them. To membrane vesicles (120 μl, 3 mg/ml) were added (in this order) 15 μl of saturated ammonium sulfate; 168 μl of a 1:1 mixture of asolectin and brain lipids, 27 μmol total, suspended in 100 mM KPi, pH 7.4, 1% glycerol, 10 mM Tris SO4 pH 7.4, 0.5 mM NaEDTA, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgSO4; 42 μl of NaCl 3 M and 22.5 μl of 20% cholic acid (neutralized with NaOH to pH 7.4. After incubation for 10 min on ice, the mixture was applied to three dried Sephadex minicolumns equilibrated with the above potassium-containing medium as described (30Radian R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11859-11865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After they were collected by centrifugation, the proteoliposomes (20 μl) were assayed for (Na++ K+)-coupled L-[3H]glutamate transport as described (Gordon and Kanner, 1988), except that millipore filters with 0.45-μm pore size were used. After the assay, the proteins were quantified according to 26Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar. Glutamate transport in membrane vesicles (without reconstitution) was done as described (Kanner and Sharon, 1978). Similar amounts of membrane suspensions (determined by the method of 7Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar) were subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using the affinity purified antibodies, used at a 1:300 dilution, as described (Mabjeesh and Kanner, 1993). The standard proteins indicated in the figures are in kilodaltons. Antibodies were raised against peptides corresponding to regions of the GLT-1 transporter predicted to be extramembranous (28Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar) as illustrated in Fig. 1A. The peptides comprised residues 17-32 (part of the amino terminus, P-692), residues 151-167 (part of loop 3-4, the loop connecting putative transmembrane helices III and IV which contains the predicted N-glycosylation sites, P-693), and residues 496-512 (part of the carboxyl-terminal, P-694). In order to increase the probability that the antibodies raised against the individual peptides would also recognize the intact protein, the hydrophilicity and antigenicity profile of these peptides was determined according to the methods described (12Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar, 13Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Mol. Immunol. 1983; 20: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Indeed, with affinity purified antibodies raised against all three peptides, an intense band of around 73 kDa can be observed in the immunoblot of rat brain membranes (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 5, and 8) which has a similar mobility as that observed with an antibody raised against the highly purified glutamate transporter (Fig. 1B, lane 1, 10Danbolt N.C. Storm-Mathisen J. Kanner B.I. Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The specificity of each of these antipeptide antibodies is illustrated by the ability of 50 nmol of the corresponding free peptide (homologous peptide) to inhibit the immunoreactivity (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 6, and 9). Heterologous peptides do not inhibit (Fig. 1B, lanes 4, 7, and 10). Similar results are obtained using the HTP-peak fractions (9Danbolt N.C. Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6734-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), a highly purified glutamate transporter preparation from rat brain (data not shown). The antibody raised against peptide P-694 was recently also shown to specifically react with the cloned and expressed glutamate transporter GLT-1 (40Zhang Y. Pines G. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19573-19577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles from rat brain have been incubated with trypsin for various times. After stopping the reaction with trypsin inhibitor and washing, the membrane proteins are separated on Tricine-SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The fragments from the glutamate transporter which contain the amino terminus have been visualized with the anti-P-692 antibody (Fig. 2A). All bands visualized with this antibody, as well as with those described below, are specific. They were competed for by homologous but not by heterologous peptides (data not shown). In the presence of sodium ions, the band of 73 kDa corresponding to the intact transporter almost completely disappears, and bands of 30 and 16 kDa are generated. The kinetics suggest that the 30 kDa band emerges first, and subsequently the 16 kDa band is derived from it (Fig. 2A). The rate of conversion of the 30 to 16 kDa band is increased if in addition to sodium, glutamate is present as well (Fig. 2A). A pattern similar to that observed in the presence of sodium is also seen in the presence of potassium, except that now the effect of glutamate is smaller (Fig. 2A). The 30 kDa band is also generated in a lithium-containing medium, but its rate of conversion to the 16 kDa band is greatly slowed down whether glutamate is present or absent (Fig. 2A). Under these conditions the generation of the 30 kDa band from the full-length transporter is also retarded (Fig. 2A). In a control experiment we established that trypsin activity is not affected by sodium, potassium, and lithium ions and also not by glutamate (data not shown). The small effect of glutamate in potassium- and lithium-containing media is due to the fact that glutamate was added as its sodium salt, as it is not observed when the Tris salt of glutamate is used (data not shown). We have also examined the functional consequences of the trypsin treatment on the transporter. We have used reconstitution to optimally express the transporters in the membrane vesicle preparation which were still active after the proteolysis. After stopping the reaction and extensive washing, the vesicles were solubilized with cholate and immediately reconstituted with a mixture of asolectin and brain lipids (Radian and Kanner, 1985) so that the internal medium contained potassium phosphate. The reconstituted proteoliposomes were diluted into the transport medium containing sodium chloride, L-[3H]glutamate and the potassium-specific ionophore, valinomycin. These conditions (inwardly directed sodium and outwardly directed potassium gradients and an interior negative membrane potential) generate the maximal driving force for L-glutamate accumulation. It can be observed that the kinetics of inactivation of transport (Fig. 2B, a typical experiment, which was run in parallel to the one depicted in Fig. 2A) is only partly correlated to the conversion of the 30 to 16 kDa bands observed in Fig. 2A. Thus, the rate of inactivation when proteolysis is carried out in the presence of sodium is only slightly faster than when it is done in the presence of lithium (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the rate of inactivation is increased in the presence of glutamate, but only when sodium is present (Fig. 2B). It is obvious that the correlation between the disappearance of the intact transporter (Fig. 2A) and the inactivation of transport activity (Fig. 2B) is partial. This discrepancy will be addressed under “Discussion.” The specificity of the effect of glutamate on the proteolysis of the 30 kDa amino-terminal fragment is shown in Fig. 3A. The conditions were chosen such that with sodium alone, both the 30 kDa as well as the 16 kDa bands are observed. Similar to the data shown in Fig. 2A, L-glutamate accelerates the proteolytic cleavage of the 30 kDa band (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The same effect is observed with L-aspartate (lane 7), D-aspartate (lane 8). All of these are substrates which are translocated by the glutamate transporter. On the other hand, the neurotransmitters GABA (lane 5), dopamine (lane 6), and serotonin (lane 9) did not exhibit the effect (Fig. 3A). The same result was obtained with D-glutamate (lane 4). This is in agreement with the well-known stereospecificity of the glutamate transporter (3Balcar V.J. Johnston G.A. J. Neurobiol. 1972; 3: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The effect of glutamate is dependent on its concentration. The half-maximal effect was observed at around 10 μM (Fig. 3B) which is somewhat higher than the observed Km for transport (around 2 μM; Kanner and Sharon, 1978). However, under transport conditions, sodium outside, potassium inside (rather than sodium on both sides), the half-maximal effect of glutamate was shifted to lower concentrations, around 5 μM. The data presented thus far can be explained by a sodium- and glutamate-dependent conformational change of the transporter, which causes two trypsin-sensitive sites, located in the amino-terminal half of the transporter, to become more exposed. The data presented in Fig. 4, in which an antibody against the carboxyl terminus was used to detect other fragments, indicate that this is also the case for at least one more site, located in the carboxyl-terminal part. In the presence of sodium alone trypsin treatment of the transporter results in the generation of a major 43 kDa band, as well as a minor band of 10 kDa. At longer times the minor 10 kDa band disappears, and part of the 43 kDa band seems to be converted into one of 35 kDa. In the presence of glutamate, the intensity of the 43 kDa band is reduced while the intensity of the 35 kDa band is increased. This phenomenon is a function of its concentration, just like that observed with the anti-P-692 antibody (data not shown). Also this effect appears to be a kinetic one as the phenomenon also occurs in the absence of glutamate but at longer times (data not shown). Again, the stimulation of the conversion of the 43 to 35 kDa band is observed with amino acid substrates of the transporter and not with those solutes which are not (data not shown). It should be pointed out that, unlike fragments containing the amino-terminal epitope P-692 (Fig. 2A and 3) or epitope P-693 (Fig. 8), those containing the carboxyl-terminal epitope P-694 give rise to a distinct pattern at the upper part of the gel (Fig. 4). This part contains a smeared background, probably reflecting fragments in different states of aggregation (Fig. 4). Although it is impossible to convey this feature, seen on the autoradiograph, to the photograph paper, it should be emphasized that superimposed on the background, the residual 73 kDa band corresponding to the intact transporter is present at strongly reduced levels.Figure 8:Immunoreactivity of the tryptic amino-terminal fragments with an antibody raised against the external N-glycosylated domain. The blot shown inFig. 2A was stripped with 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol for 45 min at 50°C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween-20, the blot was reprobed with the anti-P693 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As with the amino-terminal fragments, the ionic composition of the medium influences the trypsinization pattern, but in a slightly different way (Fig. 4). The conversion rate is increased by glutamate provided sodium is present. In the presence of lithium, a similar pattern is observed to the one with sodium, except for the lack of stimulation by L-glutamate (Fig. 4). On the other hand, in the presence of potassium, regardless of the presence of glutamate, the rate of conversion is similar to that observed in the presence of sodium and L-glutamate (Fig. 4). Dihydrokainic acid is a competitive inhibitor of the GLT-1 transporter (28Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar; 2Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but appears not to be transported by it (29Pocock J.M. Murphie H.M. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; 4Barbour B. Brew H. Attwell D. J. Physiol. 1991; 436: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar; 2Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this compound may allow us to distinguish between the possibility that the effects of L-glutamate on the trypsinization pattern of the GLT-1 transporter are due to the mere binding of the substrate or one invoking a conformational change of the transporter, subsequent to the binding step. The experiment depicted in Fig. 5A, in which the anti-P-694 antibody is used, indicates that dihydroxykainate does not induce the sodium-dependent increase of conversion of the 43- to 35-kDa fragment. In this regard, it behaves like GABA, which is not a substrate, rather than like L-glutamate (Fig. 5A). However, while an excess of GABA does not affect the ability of L-glutamate to speed up the conversion of the 43 to the 35 kDa band, excess dihydroxykainate inhibits this action of L-glutamate (Fig. 5A). Similar results are obtained with the anti-P-692 antibody (Fig. 5B). The conversion of the 30 kDa band to one of 16 kDa containing the P-692 epitope observed in the presence of sodium and potassium was greatly retarded when lithium containing media were used (Fig. 2A). Sodium and potassium are both substrates of the transporter. The retardation observed in the presence of lithium could be due to the fact that this ion is not translocated by the transporter. An alternative possibility is that lithium is not inert but is somehow interacting with the transporter and that this interaction is of a different nature than that with transportable ions. This was tested using substitution by Tris. It can be seen that with Tris present, the conversion of the 30 to the 16 kDa band is much more similar to that observed in a sodium or potassium medium than to that in lithium medium (Fig. 2A and 6). The conversion to the 16 kDa band was hardly influenced by L-glutamate, in contrast to the situation in sodium media. These observations suggest that the effects of lithium are due to a specific interaction of this cation with the transporter. Evidence for this at the functional level is seen in the experiment depicted in Fig. 7. The initial rate of glutamate transport depends on the sodium concentration in a sigmoid fashion when the ionic strength is maintained by Tris (Fig. 7). However, when lithium is used, the sodium dependence assumes the form of a rectangular hyperbola (Fig. 7). The small amount of uptake observed at zero-sodium may be due to the fact that glutamate (present at 10 μM) was added as its sodium salt. With choline substitution the sigmoid concentration dependence is observed as well (data not shown). T"

Those that catalyze the addition of water to alpha, beta-unsaturated thioesters give syn addition-elimination stereochemistry, whereas those that catalyze the addition of water to conjugated carboxylate substrates give anti stereochemistry. This dichotomy could reflect different adaptive advantages or contingencies of separate evolutionary histories. Determination of the nonenzymatic stereochemistry of deuterium oxide addition to fumarate and to S-crotonyl N-acetylcysteamine has provided direct evidence for the importance of the contingencies of evolutionary history, rather than chemical efficiency, in the pathways of these hydratase-dehydratase enzymes."
