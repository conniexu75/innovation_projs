Studies of the phosphate activation of glutaminase activity (glu- taminase I), hitherto studied in the tissues of the rat, have been extended to include other species. 2. The glutaminase activity at pH 8.0 in aqueous extracts of rat and mouse kidney, liver, brain, and spleen and of rabbit and guinea pig brain and spleen is greatly increased by added phosphate. Under the same conditions, the glutaminase activity of extracts of rabbit and guinea pig kidney and liver and of the sedimentable fraction of rabbit and guinea pig liver is only slightly increased by added phosphate. 3. Studies of the effect of various phosphate concentrations on the desamidation of glutamine in extracts of rat kidney revealed that a higher concentration of phosphate was necessary to achieve an appreciable ac- celeration of desamidation than was the case in extracts of brain or liver. The concentration of phosphate required to yield maximum acceleration"

https://openalex.org/W1963817259,"THE importance and potentialities of the paper chromatographic separation of inorganic cations have already been indicated by recent communications of Linstead1 and Lederer2. In this laboratory we have been working along similar lines, but with the object of finding general methods of separation and identification, rather than specific methods for two or three ions. Such a scheme has obvious advantages in qualitative analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1971353876,"LITTLE is known concerning the behaviour of the mitochondria during cell division. Therefore we have studied the mitosis of cells from the tail of the pancreas in very young albino mice of the Danish State Serum Institute strain. The mice were three to eight days old (weight, 3–3½ gm.). For vital staining of the pancreatic cells the technique of Scott1 was used. The carotids were clamped, a needle, wire gauge 26–27 (outer diameter, 0·5 mm. ; inner diameter, 0·22 mm.), was introduced into the left ventricle of the heart, and Janus Green B solution 1/100,000 was injected at a pressure of 250–300 mm. mercury in the course of some fifteen minutes. The heart was contracting during the injection."

Why not try to find out whether it really is, not in muscle extracts which cannot contract but in muscles which can?"

https://openalex.org/W2005439160,"THE introduction of a technique for cutting ultra-thin sections of biological tissue with the conventional microtome1 has also made feasible the sectioning of isolated cells for the electron microscope. Bacterial cells were chosen as a first example because of convenient size, ease of handling in large numbers, and because of the intrinsic importance of any new approach to the problems of bacterial morphology."

https://openalex.org/W2016683167,"RECENT experience has shown that certain grades of zinc oxide of local manufacture markedly accelerated the initiation of chalking in paint films. In the course of an investigation into these differences, it was observed that they corresponded to differences in the fluorescent behaviour of the zinc oxides when irradiated with ultra-violet light. The zinc oxides (Series A, three samples from two manufacturers), prepared by burning zinc vapour in air (French process), showed no visible fluorescence at room temperature and markedly accelerated the initiation of chalking, as compared to the zinc oxides (Series B, four grades from three manufacturers) prepared by burning zinc vapour in air containing reducing gases (as in the American process), which showed a strong yellow fluorescence."
https://openalex.org/W2041932856,"AT the Liverpool meeting of the British Association in 1923, it was shown that polarized radiation had the effect of accelerating the change of starch grains, in a weak suspension of diastase and at ordinary laboratory temperature, into a crystalline reducing substance ; but if the diastase were active or concentrated, no selective effect was observed1. Earlier experiments in 1922 had shown me that, when ground cereals in plain tap water were exposed to this radiation, a portion of the starch was turned to sugar. This was estimated by Bertrand's method2. To meet criticism that the effect might be due to the pressure of the cover glass, the experiment was repeated ; but instead of using a microscope slide, the starch suspension was in a flat-bottomed, very thin-walled flask, the base of which was irradiated by light, polarized and reflected vertically upward by a suspension of diastase in an outer vessel3."
https://openalex.org/W2987375572,"IT is well known that in the mechanism of extra-renal azotaemia the causative factor is the loss of sodium and subsequent dehydration1. According to Gomori and co-workers2, the causes of dehydration-azotaemia are as follows : (1) blood pressure falls, and in consequence of the dehydration the colloidoncotic pressure of the blood plasma increases, thus resulting in a drop of the glomerular filtration-rate ; (2) circulation is slowing down, contributing thus to the diminished filtration-rate ; (3) excessive rotein catabolism helps to aggravate the uraemic condition."

https://openalex.org/W1986600888,"I HAVE found that the irradiation of tetrafluoroethylene in the presence of mercury vapour by light of wave-length 2536 A. causes a mercury photosensitized reaction. The pressure falls and a white powder is formed. A gas of molecular weight 150 ± 1, b.p. — 33° C, m.p. — 80° C, believed to be hexafluorocyclopropane, molecular weight 150, b.p. — 31° C.1, and a small quantity of a mixture of compounds with higher boiling points have been isolated from the products of the reaction. The white powder has properties similar to those of polytetrafluoroethylene (CF2)n2, the product of the catalysed polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene."
https://openalex.org/W2009352775,"THE theory that tissue damage in silicosis is caused by silicic acid formed by solvent action of the plasma on inhaled particles stimulated the study of the solubility of airborne siliceous dusts and of the materials which give rise to them. The investigation of the solubility of mineral silicates is complicated by their peculiar properties. When a powdered siiliceous mineral is shaken with water, the solution may contain particles which range from large colloidal particles to simple ions ; and different workers have determined the solute gravimetrically aftejr filtration1, gravimetrically after ultracentrifugmg2 or colorimetrically as the silicomolybdate complex which is formed both with simple and with more complex colloidal silicic a'cids. King and McGeorge3 consider that the colorimetric method is most likely to give figures representing physiologically active 'solubb silica'."

https://openalex.org/W2005828657,"A CONFERENCE on ""The Fracture of Solids"" was held by the British Rheologists' Club on October 29, Prof. N. F. Mott, recently elected president of the Club, opened the conference by pointing out that, quite apart from its practical importance, fracture was the most interesting property of solids to the theoreticians because it is the least understood property, no progress having been made beyond the Griffith crack-theory of 1924. It is not known how cracks exist nor what causes them ; experimental work has made clear what happens during fracture, but not how it occurs."

He is also said to have stated that those who had been experimenting in the scheme were very disappointed with the results."

https://openalex.org/W1966613374,"RECENTLY, owing to the advent of various methods1 of direct determination of phase angles of Bragg reflexions from a crystal, a convenient method of determination of absolute intensities of Bragg reflexions seems urgently needed2. In 1942 I proposed a simple method of determination of absolute from relative intensities3, which has since been made rigorous and so should be reliable in general cases if used properly. Accordingly, I present here the final result of the method, which is applicable to practical cases immediately."
https://openalex.org/W1969150462,"RESEARCH on some of the problems of mushroom growing has been carried on for many years, particularly in France and in the United States. Two aspects have received special attention—the chemical and microbilogical changes in horse manure during composting, and the fungus diseases of mushrooms and mushroom beds. The principal British work on mushroom cultivation is that of Ware on diseases and of Pizer on horse-manure composts. Recently the mechanization of transport has caused an increasing shortage and rise in price problem. Research on synthetic twenty years ago, and several formulae have been published ; but many of the materials used are not available in Great Britain. Since the end of the War, American growers and research workers have devoted more attention to methods of using the available supplies of horse manure more economically, and to mechanization of their cultural operations. Synthetic composts are not widely used. Some work on synthetic composts was done in France during the 'thirties, but horse manure is still the only medium used commercially."

https://openalex.org/W4230821244,"THE Central Office of Information was established on April 1, 1946 to take over a wide but closely specified range of duties from the Ministry of Information. Its first annual report* is of particular interest as giving the first available descripiton of the general organisation of the Government information services and of the responsibilites and activites of the Central Office. The report emphasizes that the Central Office of Information is not a policy department, and that the responsibility for information and publicity policy in Britain always rests with the ministerial department covering the field into which the subject falls. Primarily the Office is a professional and technical service agency for nearly forty departments, being responsible for producing information or publicity material required by them, and being treated as the expert in presentation. It performs various other services which do not entail the production of material ; but any general influence it exerts in the nature and efficiency of information services derives from its relative size and central function, rather than from its constitutional powers. Apart from the fact that the Central Office itself employs no staff overseas, a similar relation exists between the Central Office and the Information Departments of the Overseas Departments and of the Board of Trade."
