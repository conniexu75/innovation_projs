https://openalex.org/W4293093116,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, is readily regulated by exercise, and it can inhibit NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-mediated pyroptosis. However, it is not clear whether aerobic exercise inhibits atherosclerosis via these pathways. Eight-week-old apolipoprotein E-deficient ( ApoE -/- ) mice on a high-fat diet were randomly divided into 1-h post-exercise (EX-1h), 24-h post-exercise (EX-24h), and sedentary (SED) groups. C57BL/6J wild-type mice fed normal chow served as controls (WT group). Mice in the EX-1h and EX-24h groups were subjected to treadmill exercise training for 12 weeks. Aerobic exercise reduced body weight; blood glucose, lipid, and inflammation levels; and aortic plaque area proportion. Aerobic exercise increased the sensitivity of FGF21 by upregulating the expression of the downstream receptor adiponectin (ApN); the serum FGF21 level after exercise increased initially, and then decreased. Aerobic exercise downregulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis-related markers in the aorta, and FGF21 may participate in the above process. Meanwhile, the liver may be the tissue source of serum FGF21 during aerobic exercise. In conclusion, aerobic exercise may inhibit atherogenesis by regulating FGF21 and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. Our study provides new information on the atherosclerosis-preventing mechanism of aerobic exercise."
https://openalex.org/W4293093118,"Worldwide, 10% of babies are born preterm, defined as a live birth before 37 weeks of gestation. Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death, and survivors face lifelong risks of adverse outcomes. New approaches with large sample sizes are needed to identify strategies to predict and prevent preterm birth. The primary aims of the Washington University Prematurity Research Cohort Study were to conduct three prospective projects addressing possible causes of preterm birth and provide data and samples for future research.Pregnant patients were recruited into the cohort between January 2017 and January 2020. Consenting patients were enrolled into the study before 20 weeks' gestation and followed through delivery. Participants completed demographic and lifestyle surveys; provided maternal blood, placenta samples, and cord blood; and participated in up to three projects focused on underlying physiology of preterm birth: cervical imaging (Project 1), circadian rhythms (Project 2), and uterine magnetic resonance imaging and electromyometrial imaging (Project 3).A total of 1260 participants were enrolled and delivered during the study period. Of the participants, 706 (56%) were Black/African American, 494 (39%) were nulliparous, and 185 (15%) had a previous preterm birth. Of the 1260 participants, 1220 (97%) delivered a live infant. Of the 1220 with a live birth, 163 (14.1%) had preterm birth, of which 74 (6.1%) were spontaneous preterm birth. Of the 1220 participants with a live birth, 841 participated in cervical imaging, 1047 contributed data and/or samples on circadian rhythms, and 39 underwent uterine magnetic resonance imaging. Of the 39, 25 underwent electromyometrial imaging.We demonstrate feasibility of recruiting and retaining a diverse cohort in a complex prospective, longitudinal study throughout pregnancy. The extensive clinical, imaging, survey, and biologic data obtained will be used to explore cervical, uterine, and endocrine physiology of preterm birth and can be used to develop novel approaches to predict and prevent preterm birth."

The antimicrobial peptide GL13K was derived from the salivary protein BPIFA2. This study determined the relative activity of the L-and D-enantiomers of GL13K to wild-type and drug-resistant strains of three gram-negative species and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. DGL13K displayed in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (MICs 16–32 μg/ml), MDR and XDR P . aeruginosa , and XDR Acinetobacter baumannii carrying metallo-beta-lactamases (MICs 8–32 μg/ml). P . aeruginosa showed low inherent resistance to DGL13K and the increased metabolic activity and growth caused by sub-MIC concentrations of GL13K peptides did not result in acquired bacterial resistance. Daily treatment for approximately two weeks did not increase the MIC of DGL13K or cause cross-resistance between LGL13K and DGL13K. These data suggest that DGL13K is a promising antimicrobial peptide candidate for further development."
https://openalex.org/W4293102907,"Pacific bluefin tuna, Thunnus orientalis , migrates from spawning grounds in the western Pacific Ocean to foraging grounds in the California Current System (CCS), where they are thought to specialize on high energy, surface schooling prey. However, there has been substantial variability in estimates of forage availability in the CCS over the past two decades. To examine the foraging ecology of juvenile T . orientalis in the face this variability, we quantified the diet and prey energetics of 963 individuals collected in the Southern California Bight (SCB) from 2008 to 2016. Using classification and regression tree analysis, we observed three sampling periods characterized by distinct prey. In 2008, T . orientalis diet was dominated by midwater lanternfishes and enoploteuthid squids. During 2009–2014, T . orientalis consumed diverse fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. Only in 2015–2016 did T . orientalis specialize on relatively high energy, surface schooling prey (e.g. anchovy, pelagic red crab). Despite containing the smallest prey, stomachs collected in 2009–2014 had the highest number of prey and similar total energetic contents to stomachs collected in 2015–2016. We demonstrate that T . orientalis is an opportunistic predator that can exhibit distinct foraging behaviors to exploit diverse forage. Expanding our understanding of T . orientalis foraging ecology will improve our ability to predict its responses to changes in resource availability as well as potential impacts on the fisheries it supports."
https://openalex.org/W4293105540,"Objectives This study sought to evaluate advanced psychometric properties of the 15-item Economic Strain and Resilience in Cancer (ENRICh) measure of financial toxicity for cancer patients. Methods We surveyed 515 cancer patients in the greater Houston metropolitan area using ENRICh from March 2019 to March 2020. We conducted a series of factor analyses alongside parametric and non-parametric item response theory (IRT) assessments using Mokken analysis and the graded response model (GRM). We utilized parameters derived from the GRM to run a simulated computerized adaptive test (CAT) assessment. Results Among participants, mean age was 58.49 years and 278 (54%) were female. The initial round factor analysis results suggested a one-factor scale structure. Negligible levels of differential item functioning (DIF) were evident between eight items. Three items were removed due to local interdependence (Q3&gt;+0.4). The original 11-point numerical rating scale did not function well, and a new 3-point scoring system was implemented. The final 12-item ENRICh had acceptable fit to the GRM ( p &lt;0.001; TLI = 0.94; CFI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.09; RMSR = 0.06) as well as good scalability and dimensionality. We observed high correlation between CAT version scores and the 12-item measure (r = 0.98). During CAT, items 2 (money you owe) and 4 (stress level about finances) were most frequently administered, followed by items 1 (money in savings) and 5 (ability to pay bills). Scores from these four items alone were strongly correlated with that of the 12-item ENRICh (r = 0.96). Conclusion These CAT and 4-item versions provide options for quick screening in clinical practice and low-burden assessment in research."
https://openalex.org/W4293092947,"Objectives In nursing homes, narrative data are collected to evaluate quality of care as perceived by residents or their family members. This results in a large amount of textual data. However, as the volume of data increases, it becomes beyond the capability of humans to analyze it. This study aims to explore the usefulness of text mining approaches regarding narrative data gathered in a nursing home setting. Design Exploratory study showing a variety of text mining approaches. Setting and participants Data has been collected as part of the project ‘Connecting Conversations’ : assessing experienced quality of care by conducting individual interviews with residents of nursing homes (n = 39), family members (n = 37) and care professionals (n = 49). Methods Several pre-processing steps were applied. A variety of text mining analyses were conducted: individual word frequencies, bigram frequencies, a correlation analysis and a sentiment analysis. A survey was conducted to establish a sentiment analysis model tailored to text collected in long-term care for older adults. Results Residents, family members and care professionals uttered respectively 285, 362 and 549 words per interview. Word frequency analysis showed that words that occurred most frequently in the interviews are often positive. Despite some differences in word usage, correlation analysis displayed that similar words are used by all three groups to describe quality of care. Most interviews displayed a neutral sentiment. Care professionals expressed a more diverse sentiment compared to residents and family members. A topic clustering analysis showed a total of 12 topics including ‘relations’ and ‘care environment’ . Conclusions and implications This study demonstrates the usefulness of text mining to extend our knowledge regarding quality of care in a nursing home setting. With the rise of textual (narrative) data, text mining can lead to valuable new insights for long-term care for older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4293093110,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health of people globally. Significant concerns about health and access to services among women of reproductive age considering pregnancy may cause psychological distress, and in turn increase health risks during and after pregnancy for mothers and offspring. Objectives To examine the association between pregnancy intention and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, and explore if this association differed based on local viral transmission rates and corresponding levels of pandemic restrictions. Methods A nationwide online survey was completed by 849 non-pregnant women aged 18–50 years between 15 October and 7 November 2020. Women were asked about their intention to become pregnant, and psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Multivariable regression analysis examined associations between pregnancy intention and psychological distress. An interaction term was added to the model to examine differences in associations by level of viral transmission rates and lockdown restrictions which was determined based on postcode. Results Pregnancy intention was not associated with experiencing (very) high psychological distress in the overall study population (odds ratio (OR) 1.42, 95% CI 0.94, 2.11). The interaction term (p = 0.09) suggested potential differences by level of restrictions and viral transmission rates. In stratified analysis among women living in a location with strict lockdown restrictions and high viral transmission rates leading up to and during the study, those planning to become pregnant were more likely to experience (very) high psychological distress (OR 3.39, 2.04, 5.65) compared with women not planning to become pregnant. Pregnancy intention was not associated with psychological distress among women exposed to lower levels of pandemic restrictions and viral transmission rates (OR 1.17, 0.74, 1.85). Conclusions Our findings highlight the need to identify and support women planning pregnancy during a public health crisis to mitigate potential short- and long-term intergenerational negative health outcomes associated with psychological distress."
https://openalex.org/W4293103137,"The prevention and treatment of chronic pain problems in breast cancer follow-up care require an adequate response from healthcare providers. Generally, this involves the uptake of evidence-based principles regarding pain management in everyday practice. However, despite the extensive literature on effective pain interventions, systematic and coordinated follow-up care is lacking for breast cancer survivors with pain problems in Flanders, Belgium.This study aimed to gather insight into healthcare providers' perceptions of pain prevention and treatment in breast cancer follow-up care, particularly with attention to the multilevel influences on pain follow-up.We conducted four online focus groups with twenty-two healthcare providers from different disciplines such as oncologists, pharmacists, nurses, physiotherapists, and psychologists. Data analysis was guided by the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven. This guide is inspired by the constant comparison method, based on Grounded Theory.The identified influencing factors were thematically grouped into four levels: at the level of the individual healthcare provider, in interaction with the patient, in interaction with colleagues, and at the context level. At each level, we distinguished factors related to healthcare providers' perceptions such as awareness, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, experiences, and intentions. For example, because of a lack of knowledge and certain beliefs among healthcare providers, referral to other disciplines often does not happen in the context of pain.This study points out the need to explore the prevention and treatment of chronic pain after breast cancer from a multidimensional point of view. This involves not only the characteristics of individual healthcare providers but is also inherently interactional and system-like in nature. This analysis provides opportunities for the development of interventions that target the influencing factors of prevention and treatment of chronic pain in breast cancer survivors."
https://openalex.org/W4293084485,"In a digital and knowledge based economy, intangible assets are predominant and their role along with age and knowledge has become key success factors for firms. However, a very little attention was given to the intangible assets in the banking sectors’ in Ethiopia and the effect still not studied yet. Therefore, the aim of this study is to empirically examine the effect of intangible assets on the financial performance and policy of 17 commercial banks in Ethiopia from the year 2017 to 2020. Return on asset and equity were used to measure the financial performance and debt as a measure of financial policy. The intangible asset is used as the main explanatory variable and asset size and liquidity as control variables. Random effect estimation technique for panel data was used. The result revealed that intangible asset has positive effect on the financial performance measured both by ROA and ROE at 5% significance level while, negative effect on the financial policy of commercial banks in Ethiopia at 1% significance level. Moreover, the study found asset size has significant and positive effect on ROA and ROE at 1% and 5% significance level respectively. Liquidity ratio has also significant positive effect on the financial performance measured both by ROA and ROE at 5% significance level. Finally, the finding revealed asset size and liquidity ratio has significant positive effect on the financial policy of commercial banks in Ethiopia at 10% and 1% significance level respectively. Therefore, the study concludes that financial performance and policy is achieved not only by using physical assets but also using intangible assets. Thus, the boards and mangers of commercial banks’ ought to plan and maintain the appropriate ratio of intangible assets to total assets for securing sustainable development in achieving the maximization of shareholders wealth and to have optimum debt."
https://openalex.org/W4293092952,"While infectious diseases (ID) are a well-documented public health issue in carceral settings, research on ID screening and treatment in jails is lacking. A survey was sent to 1,126 jails in the United States to identify the prevalence of health screenings at intake and characteristics of care for ID; 371 surveys were completed correctly and analyzed. Despite conflicting Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance, only seven percent of surveyed jails test individuals for HIV at admission. In 46% of jails, non-healthcare personnel perform ID screenings. Jails in less urban areas were more likely to report healthcare screenings performed by correctional officers. Survey findings indicate that HIV, HCV and TB testing during jail admissions and access to PrEP are severely lacking in less urban jails in particular. Recommendations are provided to improve ID surveillance and address the burden of ID in correctional facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4293093087,"Radiation intensity and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration can be precisely controlled to manipulate plant yield and quality. Due to increased plant densities during seedling production, fewer inputs per plant are required, creating the potential to increase production efficiency. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to: 1) quantify the extent radiation intensity and CO2 concentration under sole-source lighting influence morphology and yield of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) seedlings, and 2) determine if differences in morphology, yield, and volatile organic compound (VOC) concentration persist after transplant in a common environment. Sweet basil 'Nufar' seedlings were grown in growth chambers with target CO2 concentrations of 500 or 1,000 μmol·mol‒1 under light-emitting diodes (LEDs) providing target photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD) of 100, 200, 400, or 600 μmol·m‒2·s‒1 for 16 h per day. After two weeks, seedlings were transplanted into a common greenhouse environment and grown until harvest. At transplant and three weeks after transplant (harvest), growth and developmental differences were quantified along with key terpenoid and phenylpropanoid concentrations at harvest. Radiation intensity and CO2 interacted influencing many aspects of plant morphology, though CO2 concentration effects were less pronounced than those of radiation intensity. As radiation intensity during seedling production increased from 100 to 600 μmol·m‒2·s‒1, basil seedlings were 38% taller, had a 713% larger leaf area, and had 65% thicker stems; at harvest, plants were 24% taller, had 56% more branches, 28% more nodes, 22% thicker stems, and weighed 80% more when fresh and dry. Additionally, after growing in a common environment for three weeks, eugenol concentration was greater in plants grown under a PPFD of 600 μmol·m‒2·s‒1 as seedlings compared to lower intensities. Therefore, increasing radiation intensity during seedling production under sole-source lighting can carry over to increase subsequent yield and eugenol concentration during finished production."
https://openalex.org/W4293103010,"Much effort has been devoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections by 2030 using mass drug administration targeted at particular risk groups alongside the availability to access water, sanitation and hygiene services. The targets set by the WHO for the control of helminth infections are typically defined in terms of the prevalence of infection, whereas the standard formulation of STH transmission models typically describe dynamic changes in the mean-worm burden. We develop a prevalence-based deterministic model to investigate the transmission dynamics of soil-transmitted helminthiasis in humans, subject to continuous exposure to infection over time. We analytically determine local stability criteria for all equilibria and find bifurcation points. Our model predicts that STH infection will either be eliminated (if the initial prevalence value, y (0), is sufficiently small) or remain endemic (if y (0) is sufficiently large), with the two stable points of endemic infection and parasite eradication separated by a transmission breakpoint. Two special cases of the model are analysed: (1) the distribution of the STH parasites in the host population is highly aggregated following a negative binomial distribution, and (2) no density-dependent effects act on the parasite population. We find that disease extinction is always possible for Case (1), but it is not so for Case (2) if y (0) is sufficiently large. However, by introducing stochastic perturbation into the deterministic model, we discover that chance effects can lead to outcomes not predicted by the deterministic model alone, with outcomes highly dependent on the degree of worm clumping, k . Specifically, we show that if the reproduction number and clumping are sufficiently bounded, then stochasticity will cause the parasite to die out. It follows that control of soil-transmitted helminths will be more difficult if the worm distribution tends towards clumping."
https://openalex.org/W4293103856,"The key to overcoming COVID-19 lies, arguably, in the diffusion process of confirmed cases. In view of this, this study has two main aims: first, to investigate the unique characteristics of COVID-19—for the existence of asymptomatic cases—and second, to determine the best strategy to suppress the diffusion of COVID-19. To this end, this study proposes a new compartmental model—the SICUR model—which can address undetected asymptomatic cases and considers the three main drivers of the diffusion of COVID-19: the degree of social distancing, the speed of testing, and the detection rate of infected cases. Taking each country’s situation into account, it is suggested that susceptible cases can be classified into two categories based on their sources of occurrence: internal and external factors. The results show that the ratio of undetected asymptomatic cases to infected cases will, ceteris paribus , be 6.9% for South Korea and 22.4% for the United States. This study also quantitatively shows that to impede the diffusion of COVID-19: firstly, strong social distancing is necessary when the detection rate is high, and secondly, fast testing is effective when the detection rate is low."
https://openalex.org/W4293105069,"Background Proper disaster preparedness by community pharmacists has the potential to counter many of the factors that cause threats and high-risk outcomes. Their preparedness and awareness may also help health practitioners and governments to improve disaster response planning. Objectives This aims to explore the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards disaster medicine preparedness and readiness among community pharmacists in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Method A cross-sectional study was conducted over the ten months among licensed community pharmacists who had three months’ professional experience or more. Face-to-face interviews were carried out and a structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Logistic regression models were used to determine the factors influencing aboucine preparedness and readiness. SPSS Version 24 was used to analyze the data collected. Results A total of 500 community pharmacists participated in the study. The average knowledge score was 25.6% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [21.7%, 29.4%]. Better knowledge scores were observed in the male gender (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.05–3.72), participants aged ≥ 31 years old (OR 2.97; 95% CI 1.16–7.6), postgraduates (OR 4.36; 95% CI 2.6–7.3), participants from independent Pharmacies (OR 6.5; 95% CI 4.04–10.4 3), chief pharmacists (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.86–5.07), participants with 16 years and more experience years (OR 2.42; 95% CI 1.063–5.522) and participants who graduated from regional/international universities (OR 5.92; 95% CI 2.65–13.2). Better attitude and practice about disaster medicine preparedness were observed in postgraduates (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.26–pharmacists from independent pharmacies (OR 1.35; 95% CI 2.43–2,.66), and chief pharmacists (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.17–1.35). Conclusions It’s essential to provide a continuing education program using different educational strategies urgently needed to improve community pharmacy competencies (e.g. knowledge attitudes, and perceptions) to improve the skills and practices regarding disaster medicine preparedness and readiness."
https://openalex.org/W4293105156,"Reduced expression in immortalized cells/Dickkopf-3 (REIC/Dkk-3) is a tumor suppressor and its overexpression has been shown to exert anti-tumor effects as a therapeutic target gene in many human cancers. Recently, we demonstrated the anti-glioma effects of an adenoviral vector carrying REIC/Dkk-3 with the super gene expression system (Ad-SGE-REIC). Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments such as bevacizumab have demonstrated convincing therapeutic advantage in patients with glioblastoma. However, bevacizumab did not improve overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. In this study, we examined the effects of Ad-SGE-REIC on glioma treated with bevacizumab. Ad-SGE-REIC treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the number of invasion cells treated with bevacizumab. Western blot analyses revealed the increased expression of several endoplasmic reticulum stress markers in cells treated with both bevacizumab and Ad-SGE-REIC, as well as decreased β-catenin protein levels. In malignant glioma mouse models, overall survival was extended in the combination therapy group. These results suggest that the combination therapy of Ad-SGE-REIC and bevacizumab exerts anti-glioma effects by suppressing the angiogenesis and invasion of tumors. Combined Ad-SGE-REIC and bevacizumab might be a promising strategy for the treatment of malignant glioma."
https://openalex.org/W4293105642,"Insufficient pollination leads to low and unstable production of oil tree peony. Supplementary managed honeybees ( Apis mellifera L.) in agricultural ecosystems is a common practice for addressing the problem. At this study site (N 34°38′30″ and E 112°39′43″, with an altitude of 125.5 m), we set up four pollination areas (low-density bee pollination group (LDBP), high-density bee pollination group (HDBP), blank control group (CK1) and field control group (CK2)) to examine the pollination effectiveness of different densities of honeybee supplementation on oil tree peony ( Paeonia ostii ). Our work demonstrated that bee-pollination increased fruit size and growth rate. On average, bee-pollinated (LDBP) plants produced 63.16% more number of seeds per plant, showed also 53.47% more weight of seeds per plant than those in CK2. Also, seeds of LDBP contained, on average, 26.15% more oil content than CK2. Kernel percent and seed oil fatty acid content, however, were unaffected (F = 1.759, p = 0.074). Compared with LDBP, weight of seeds per plant and oil content with HDBP decreased by 21.89% and 2.63%, respectively. Following the same trend, compared with LDBP, HDBP slowed fruit growth and reduced fruit size. Our results showed that insufficient pollination limits fruit set in oil tree peony, while supplementary reasonable bee density in the field for pollination is an important strategy to maximize fruit yield."
https://openalex.org/W4293093097,"Adolescents are increasingly interested in weight control; hence, proper health education is important for helping them control their weight properly. This study was designed to pick out social media words that express adolescents' diet behaviors, and identify the associations and types between such words and the behaviors. It used text-mining techniques and semantic network analysis for related big data collected from the Internet on adolescents' diet behaviors. Text mining was used to extract meaningful information from unstructured text data, whereas semantic network analysis was used to understand the relationships between keywords. The top five keywords were ""obesity,"" ""health,"" ""exercise,"" ""eat,"" and ""increase"" in online news, and ""exercise,"" ""eat,"" ""weight loss,"" ""obesity,"" and ""health"" in blogs. The betweenness centrality of ""appearance"" was particularly higher than that of other centralities in online news. As a result of the CONCOR analysis, eight clusters each were identified in online news and blogs. This study's results will serve as a basis for weight management-related intervention strategies, reflecting the perspectives of adolescents. It also has significance as basic data to provide correct information, and establish desirable weight control in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4293093105,"Objectives Cigarette smoking rates among people living with HIV (PLWH) in the US is triple that of the general population. PLWH smokers are a high-risk group for smoking-related health disparities and should be a prime focus for smoking cessation efforts. Our team has developed a novel evidence-based Mindfulness Training (MT) smoking cessation smartphone application (app), “Craving-to-Quit.” Using qualitative focus groups among PLWH smokers, this study aims to tailor and optimize the app’s content and design to PLWH’s unique psychosocial profile and needs. Methods We conducted 8 focus groups among PLWH smokers (n = 59; 47.5% females; ≥18 years) to gain insight into participants’ perceptions about the app, MT, and the feasibility and acceptability of adding two additional strategies (CM: Contingency Management; self-monitoring of anti-retroviral therapies intake [ART]) to further optimize the app. Participants were asked to practice MTs and watch videos from the app presented on a screen in the conference room to discuss their experience. Sessions were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically using NVivo. Results Most participants were non-Hispanic black (67.8%), on a federal health insurance program (61.0%). Participants considered it easy to learn the app and thought that MT is helpful in reducing stress and motivating quit attempts and were supportive of adding CM and recommended providing $20-$50 weekly cash incentives to help in quitting. Participants felt that adding self-monitoring of ART is helpful but were concerned about confidentiality in case they lost their phone. Participants recommended making the app cost-free and adding information about smoking cessation medications and the negative effects of smoking among PLWH. Conclusions Findings will guide the development of a novel multi-component smoking cessation intervention app integrating MT, CM, and ART self-monitoring strategies. This intervention has the potential to address several barriers to quitting in PLWH. Further clinical research is needed to test this intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4293102189,"Telomerase-mediated lengthening is a mechanism by which some cancer cells avoid senescence-mediated cell cycle arrest due to shortened telomeres. By reverse transcribing an RNA template, encoded by TERC , the enzyme telomerase synthesizes the elongation of telomeric DNA using the 3’ end of the chromosome as a primer. TERC harbors a highly conserved template region consisting of 11 nucleotides spanning hg19 coordinates chr3:169482793–169482803. In human cell lines, when TERC was mutated to alter its template region, telomerase generated the predicted mutant telomeric repeats. However, it is unknown if this can occur in human clinical samples. Here, we report on the rare occurrence of two tumor samples where TERC template mutations were reflected in telomeric repeats."
https://openalex.org/W4293102803,"Pyrexia is a frequent adverse event of BRAF/MEK-inhibitor combination therapy in patients with metastasized malignant melanoma (MM). The study’s objective was to identify laboratory changes which might correlate with the appearance of pyrexia. Initially, data of 38 MM patients treated with dabrafenib plus trametinib, of which 14 patients developed pyrexia, were analysed retrospectively. Graphical visualization of time series of laboratory values suggested that a rise in C-reactive-protein, in parallel with a fall of leukocytes and thrombocytes, were indicative of pyrexia. Additionally, statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pyrexia. An algorithm based on these observations was designed using a deductive and heuristic approach in order to calculate a pyrexia score (PS) for each laboratory assessment in treated patients. A second independent data set of 28 MM patients, 8 with pyrexia, was used for the validation of the algorithm. PS based on the four parameters CRP, LDH, leukocyte and thrombocyte numbers, were statistically significantly higher in pyrexia patients, differentiated between groups (F = 20.8; p = &lt;0.0001) and showed a significant predictive value for the diagnosis of pyrexia (F = 6.24; p = 0.013). We provide first evidence that pyrexia in patients treated with BRAF/MEK-blockade can be identified by an algorithm that calculates a score."
https://openalex.org/W4293103159,"Objective We explored the clinical significances of the relationships among sphenoid sinus aeration, intersphenoid sinus septum (ISS), and internal carotid artery (ICA). Methods We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative paranasal sinus computed tomography scans and the medical charts of 490 patients who were treated by the endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. We analyzed sphenoid sinus pneumatization, number of ISS, and positional relationships between the ICA and ISS (including ICA prominence and the thickness of surrounding bone). Results ISS were often present in the ICAs of patients with presellar pneumatization (36.2%; p = 0.042). Sphenoid sinus pneumatization status significantly differed according to number of ISS (p &lt; 0.001), ICA prominence (p &lt; 0.001), ISS insertion into the ICA (p = 0.042), and distance from ISS to ICA (p = 0.004). When sphenoid sinus aeration was poor, the ICA was not prominent, and the ISS were attached to or lay close to the paraclival ICA. Conclusions Patients with presellar pneumatization exhibited less prominent ICAs, and more ISS attached to or near the paraclival ICA, than did other patients. Therefore, particular caution is required when using the endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach to treat patients with poor sphenoid sinus aeration."

We conducted two studies to investigate how personality relates to KSAOs in the different contexts of FtF and CM communication. Contrasting perspectives hypothesize that the results in the FtF and CM contexts would be very similar or distinctly different. In Study 1 (n = 454), an online panel study, the Big Five personality dimensions were assessed and their relationships to FtF and CM communication KSAOs were investigated. Structural equation models and relative weight regression analyses showed that these personality dimensions, mostly extraversion and neuroticism, explained more variance in FtF as compared to CM communication KSAOs. Study 2 (n = 173), conducted in a laboratory context, showed similar results compared to Study 1. In addition, when the Big Five personality dimensions were assessed with a CM frame of reference, more variance was explained in CM than in FtF communication KSAOs. These results point to the importance of considering context effects in communication and in personality research: FtF and CM communication KSAOs need to be differentiated. If not properly contextualized, the relevance of personality and communication competencies in predicting criteria may be underestimated due to contextual mismatches."
https://openalex.org/W4293103445,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic is causing widespread morbidity and mortality. It has led to a myriad of mental health problems, particularly in health care providers (HCPs). To strengthen the fight against COVID-19, it is essential to investigate the mental health challenges being faced by the HCPs, their emotional responses, and coping strategies. Objectives We aimed to explore the lived experiences of frontline HCPs in rural India during the peak of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Through purposive heterogenous snowball sampling, five HCPs in rural Dhanbad were recruited and one-on-one double-blind unstructured interviews were conducted. The interviews were transcribed and master themes and subthemes were extracted by interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results Six master themes and 23 subthemes were identified. Our findings demonstrate that the participants were under mental duress due to heavy workloads, fear of getting infected and transmitting the infection, urban–rural disparities in access to medical supplies and peer support, and negative social perception of HCPs during the pandemic. Most HCPs have not yet processed the psychological effects of being at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic in a resource-poor setting; however, spirituality seems to be an important coping mechanism that helps them get through the day. Conclusions This study is unique in the sense that not many studies have been conducted to evaluate the psychological issues of Indian HCPs during this pandemic. Much less is known about the mental health of HCPs in rural settings. Moreover, novel findings such as negative social perception of HCPs during the pandemic and HCPs resorting to spirituality as a coping strategy against stress, open a plethora of research opportunities wherein the results of this qualitative study, along with the existing literature and findings of future quantitative studies, can establish better understanding of the impact of the pandemic on HCPs."

To address this, an improved mayfly algorithm based on dynamic elite strategy (DESMA) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, it first determines the specific space near the best mayfly in the current population, and dynamically sets the search radius. Then generating a certain number of elite mayflies within this range. Finally, the best one among the newly generated elite mayflies is selected to replace the best mayfly in the current population when the fitness value of elite mayfly is better than that of the best mayfly. Experimental results on 28 standard benchmark test functions from CEC2013 show that our proposed algorithm outperforms its peers in terms of accuracy speed and stability."

China redeployed healthcare workers to serve the most vulnerable populations and communities in the initial epicentre-Wuhan. However, it is not known how redeployment processes impacted on healthcare workers in a pandemic crisis.To explore the experiences and needs of frontline healthcare workers who were redeployed to care for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and understand the long-term impacts of the redeployment experience on their work and life.A qualitative study was conducted with redeployed healthcare workers using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. This study is reported in accordance with the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) guidelines.A total of 20 redeployed healthcare workers (13 nurses and seven physicians) participated, and four themes were generated: (1) Initial feelings and emotions of redeployment-Participants experienced worries and concerns, a sense of isolation and loneliness on their arrival to the epicentre. (2) 'It is like a war zone'-Healthcare workers faced a range of risks and challenges of caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan in the context of resource strain. (3) Uncertainty and coping strategies in patient care-Despite the hardships experienced, participants continued to deliver high-quality patient care including psychological care and palliative care, good communication and building mutual trusting relationships. (4) Reflection and far-reaching impacts of caring for COVID-19 patients-Participants felt motivated and encouraged as efforts were recognised by the government and wider society.Redeployed healthcare workers shared their unique needs and experiences of coping with redeployment and challenges they faced in the context of resource strain, which has significant implications for policy and future practice. The reality of a pandemic may reduce healthcare workers' willingness to work due to various reasons including inadequate preparedness of facilities and workplace safety. It is important to support frontline healthcare workers in order to maintain an adequate healthcare workforce in pandemic crises. Continuously evolving pandemic circumstances and uncertainty highlight the importance of an organized national pandemic response plan for subsequent waves of COVID-19 and future pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4293105860,"Salvia miltiorrhiza is a model plant for Chinese herbal medicine with significant pharmacologic effects due to its tanshinone components. Our previous study indicated that nitrogen starvation stress increased its tanshinone content. However, the molecular mechanism of this low nitrogen-induced tanshinone biosynthesis is still unclear. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of tanshinone biosynthesis in S . miltiorrhiza under different N conditions [N-free (N0), low-N (Nl), and full-N (Nf, as control) conditions] by using transcriptome and metabolome analyses. Our results showed 3,437 and 2,274 differentially expressed unigenes between N0 and Nf as well as Nl and Nf root samples, respectively. N starvation (N0 and Nl) promoted the expression of the genes involved in the MVA and MEP pathway of tanshinone and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. Gene ontology and KEGG analyses revealed that terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, hormone signal transduction, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were promoted under N starvation conditions, whereas starch and sucrose metabolisms, nitrogen and phosphorus metabolisms, as well as membrane development were inhibited. Furthermore, metabolome analysis showed that metabolite compounds and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were upregulated. This study provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of tanshinone production in S . miltiorrhiza in response to nitrogen stress."
https://openalex.org/W4293092935,"Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) Meniscus removal is an option for the patient to regain full range of motion if the disc is irreversibly damaged or unable to be reduced. However, this procedure leaves the joint vulnerable to condylar remodeling and degeneration. We have shown that extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds remodel into a tissue with near native TMJ meniscus in previous studies. The next step towards clinical translation is to manufacture the ECM scaffold as a device under good manufacturing practices (GMP) and test it in a pre-clinical animal study under good laboratory practices (GLP). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the in-vivo histopathological response to a Prototype GMP manufactured device made of decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS), by observing for signs of surrounding tissue reaction to the device that are indicative of an adverse host response in comparison to an empty control at 21 days post-surgical implantation in a canine TMJ meniscus removal and implant model in a GLP setting. The conclusive findings were that the ECM device is safe for placement in the TMJ. After 21 days post implantation, histology of tissue surrounding the device and draining lymph nodes showed that the Prototype GMP device had no negative effects compared to the empty site (as evaluated by the board-certified veterinary pathologist). Furthermore, there was a lack of negative findings for clinical pathology (hematology and clinical chemistry), mortality, and body weight/weight change. Future studies will go to one year after implantation to show that the remodel device remains as a viable tissue with near native mechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W4293093119,"The green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using a water extract of Ginger (Zingiber officinale) root by microwave irradiation and its antibacterial activities have been reported. However, AgNPs prepared from different parts of ginger root water or ethanol extract by ultrasound synthesis and their antioxidant activity and whether the biogenic could be used to catalyze the reduction of hazardous dye are unknown. This study concentrated on the facile green synthesis of AgNPs prepared from different parts (unpeeled ginger, peeled ginger, and ginger peel) of ginger root water or ethanol extract by the ultrasound-assisted method. We studied their antioxidant activity and catalytic degradation of hazardous dye Direct Orange 26 (DO26) and Direct Blue 15 (DB15). The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak of AgNPs was at 428–443 nm. The biogenic AgNPs were approximately 2 nm in size with a regular spherical shape identified from TEM analysis. The ethanol extracts of dried unpeeled ginger and peeled ginger, fresh peeled ginger and ginger peel. The Z . officinale AgNPs synthesized by dried unpeeled ginger ethanol extract showed the best antioxidant activity. Their scavenging activities were significantly better than BHT ( p &lt;0.05). The different parts of ginger extracts showed no catalytic degradation activities of DB15 and DO26. Still, the synthesized Z . officinale AgNPs exhibited good catalytic degradation activities, while their ability to catalytic degradation to DB15 was better than DO26. In the additive ratio of 3 mL DB15, 0.1 mL NaBH 4 and 0.1 mL AgNPs, the degradation rates of DB15 (or DO26) at 15 min, 30 min and 60 min were only 1.8% (0.9%), 2.8% (1.4%) and 3.5% (1.6%) in the absence of AgNPs. When adding Z . officinale AgNPs prepared from dried ginger peel ethanol extract or fresh ginger peel water extract, the degradation rates of DB15 sharply increased to 97% and 93% after 30 min, respectively. In conclusion, ginger extract has good antioxidant properties. Z . officinale AgNPs biosynthesis from ginger extract exhibit excellent catalytic degradation activities, especially for the ginger peel extract. They have application value in the treatment of textile effluents and provide a new idea and method for the comprehensive development and utilization of ginger resources."
https://openalex.org/W4293093121,"Hypoxia plays a major role in the etiology and pathogenesis of most of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, whether cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases or stroke. Despite active research on hypoxia-signaling pathways, the understanding of regulatory mechanisms, especially in specific tissues, still remain elusive. With the accessibility of thousands of potentially diverse genomic datasets, computational methods are utilized to generate new hypotheses. Here we utilized Boolean implication relationship, a powerful method to probe symmetrically and asymmetrically related genes, to identify novel hypoxia related genes. We used a well-known hypoxia-responsive gene, VEGFA , with very large human expression datasets (n = 25,955) to identify novel hypoxia-responsive candidate gene/s. Further, we utilized in-vitro analysis using human endothelial cells exposed to 1% O 2 environment for 2, 8, 24 and 48 hours to validate top candidate genes. Out of the top candidate genes (n = 19), 84% genes were previously reported as hypoxia related, validating our results. However, we identified FAM114A1 as a novel candidate gene significantly upregulated in the endothelial cells at 8, 24 and 48 hours of 1% O 2 environment. Additional evidence, particularly the localization of intronic miRNA and numerous HREs further support and strengthen our finding. Current results on FAM114A1 provide an example demonstrating the utility of powerful computational methods, like Boolean implications, in playing a major role in hypothesis building and discovery."

Evaluating ROH pattern can help to understand inbreeding level and genetic basis of important traits. In this study, three representative cattle populations including Leiqiong cattle (LQC), Lufeng cattle (LFC) and Hainan cattle (HNC) were genotyped using the Illumina BovineHD SNPs array (770K) to assess ROH pattern at genome wide level. Totally, we identified 26,537 ROH with an average of 153 ROH per individual. The sizes of ROH ranged from 0.5 to 53.26Mb, and the average length was 1.03Mb. The average of FROH ranged from 0.10 (LQC) to 0.15 (HNC). Moreover, we identified 34 ROH islands (with frequency > 0.5) across genome. Based on these regions, we observed several breed-specific candidate genes related to adaptive traits. Several common genes related to immunity (TMEM173, MZB1 and SIL1), and heat stress (DNAJC18) were identified in all three populations. Three genes related to immunity (UGP2), development (PURA) and reproduction (VPS54) were detected in both HNC and LQC. Notably, we identified several breed-specific genes related to sperm development (BRDT and SPAG6) and heat stress (TAF7) in HNC, and immunity (CDC23 and NME5) and development (WNT87) in LFC. Our findings provided valuable insights into understanding the genomic homozygosity pattern and promoting the conservation of genetic resources of Chinese indigenous cattle."
https://openalex.org/W4293093169,"With the exploration and development of marine resources, deep learning is more and more widely used in underwater image processing. However, the quality of the original underwater images is so low that traditional semantic segmentation methods obtain poor segmentation results, such as blurred target edges, insufficient segmentation accuracy, and poor regional boundary segmentation effects. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a semantic segmentation method for underwater images. Firstly, the image enhancement based on multi-spatial transformation is performed to improve the quality of the original images, which is not common in other advanced semantic segmentation methods. Then, the densely connected hybrid atrous convolution effectively expands the receptive field and slows down the speed of resolution reduction. Next, the cascaded atrous convolutional spatial pyramid pooling module integrates boundary features of different scales to enrich target details. Finally, the context information aggregation decoder fuses the features of the shallow network and the deep network to extract rich contextual information, which greatly reduces information loss. The proposed method was evaluated on RUIE, HabCam UID, and UIEBD. Compared with the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms, the proposed method has advantages in segmentation integrity, location accuracy, boundary clarity, and detail in subjective perception. On the objective data, the proposed method achieves the highest MIOU of 68.3 and OA of 79.4, and it has a low resource consumption. Besides, the ablation experiment also verifies the effectiveness of our method."
https://openalex.org/W4293101780,"One major challenge in PET radiomics is its sensitivity to noise. Low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) affects not only the precision but also the accuracy of quantitative metrics extracted from the images resulting in noise-induced bias. This phantom study aims to identify the radiomic features that are robust to noise in terms of precision and accuracy and to explore some methods that might help to correct noise-induced bias.A phantom containing three 18F-FDG filled 3D printed inserts, reflecting heterogeneous tracer uptake and realistic tumor shapes, was used in the study. The three different phantom inserts were filled and scanned with three different tumor-to-background ratios, simulating a total of nine different tumors. From the 40-minute list-mode data, ten frames each for 5 s, 10 s, 30 s, and 120 s frame duration were reconstructed to generate images with different noise levels. Under these noise conditions, the precision and accuracy of the radiomic features were analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and similarity distance metric (SDM) respectively. Based on the ICC and SDM values, the radiomic features were categorized into four groups: poor, moderate, good, and excellent precision and accuracy. A ""difference image"" created by subtracting two statistically equivalent replicate images was used to develop a model to correct the noise-induced bias. Several regression methods (e.g., linear, exponential, sigmoid, and power-law) were tested. The best fitting model was chosen based on Akaike information criteria.Several radiomic features derived from low SNR images have high repeatability, with 68% of radiomic features having ICC ≥ 0.9 for images with a frame duration of 5 s. However, most features show a systematic bias that correlates with the increase in noise level. Out of 143 features with noise-induced bias, the SDM values were improved based on a regression model (53 features to excellent and 67 to good) indicating that the noise-induced bias of these features can be, at least partially, corrected.To have a predictive value, radiomic features should reflect tumor characteristics and be minimally affected by noise. The present study has shown that it is possible to correct for noise-induced bias, at least in a subset of the features, using a regression model based on the local image noise estimates."

While a Pediatric Clinical Classification System (PECCS) is available for the United States ICD-10 system (i.e, ICD-10-CM), differences in the ICD-10 system between countries limits PECCS use in Canada.To translate PECCS from ICD-10-CM to ICD-10-CA for use in Canada (PECCS-CA), and examine the utility of PECCS-CA in administrative data of pediatric hospital encounters in Ontario, Canada.PECCS was translated by mapping each ICD-10-CA code to its corresponding ICD-10-CM code, based on code description and alphanumeric code, using automated functions in Microsoft Excel. All unmatched ICD-10-CA codes were manually matched to an ICD-10-CM code. The ICD-10-CA codes were mapped to a PECCS category based on the placement of the corresponding ICD-10-CM code. Finally, in this cross-sectional study, the utility of PECCS-CA was examined in pediatric hospital encounters in children <18 years of age with an inpatient or same day surgery encounter, between April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2019 in Ontario.In total, 16,992 ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes were mapped to 781 mutually exclusive condition categories that included pediatric specific conditions and treatments in PECCS-CA. From the 781 categories, 777 (99.5%) were derived from the original PECCS, 3 (0.4%) from merging the original PECCS categories, and 1 (0.1%) was newly developed. The PECCS-CA was applied to health administrative data of 911,732 hospital encounters in children. The most prevalent condition in children was low birth weight (n = 54,100 encounters).The PECCS-CA is an open-source classification system which maps ICD-10-CA codes into 781 clinically important pediatric categories.

The purpose of the study was to correlate nematode worm burden and selected host phenotypic characteristics, such as age and weight, with the composition of the intestinal microbiota of adult alpacas. Fecal samples were collected per rectum from 102 healthy adult (2.1–11.2 years) alpacas at 3 separate timepoints (pre- and post-treatment with 8.8 mg/kg oral Levamisole HCL, and 4.6 months later) at a single farm. The profile of the fecal bacterial microbiota was characterized using 16S amplicon sequencing. Serial clinical exams and fecal egg counts were compared using related-samples analyses. The fecal microbiota of identically managed, healthy alpacas was characterized by a high level of temporal stability, as both α and β-diversity significantly correlated between sampling timepoints. Pairwise β-diversity between samples collected at each timepoint was low, ranging from 0.16–0.21 UniFrac distance units. The intensity of strongylid nematode infection (including Haemonchus , Ostertagia , Trichostrongylus ) was only significantly correlated with microbiota composition in samples collected 14 days after treatment with levamisole. Analysis of similarity revealed no clustering of microbiota from anthelmintic responders or non-responders. Alpaca age explained the largest proportion of fecal microbiota variation and was the only consistently significant predictor of fecal microbiota taxonomic composition, by impacting the ratio of relative Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes abundance. Firmicutes, mostly Clostridiales, was the most abundant taxon across all collections."

In this study, we systematically explored the interaction of epilepsy risk genes and anti-epileptic drug targets through a network-based approach. Our results revealed that anti-epileptic drug targets were significantly over-represented in risk genes of epilepsy with 17 overlapping genes and P-value = 2.2 ×10 -16. We identified a significantly localized PPI network with 55 epileptic risk genes and 94 anti-epileptic drug target genes, and network overlap analysis showed significant interactome overlap between risk genes and drug targets with P-value = 0.04. Besides, genes from PPI network were significantly enriched in the co-expression network of epilepsy with 22 enriched genes and P-value = 1.3 ×10 -15; meanwhile, cell type enrichment analysis indicated genes in this network were significantly enriched in 4 brain cell types (Interneuron, Medium Spiny Neuron, CA1 pyramidal Neuron, and Somatosensory pyramidal Neuron). These results provide evidence for significant interactions between epilepsy risk genes and anti-epileptic drug targets from the perspective of network biology."
https://openalex.org/W4293102860,"Humans have associations between numbers and physical space on both horizontal and vertical dimensions, called Spatial-Numerical Associations (SNAs). Several studies have considered the hypothesis of there being a dominant orientation by examining on which dimension people are more accurate and efficient at responding during various directional SNA tasks. However, these studies have difficulty differentiating between a person’s efficiency at accessing mental representations of numbers in space, and the efficiency at which they exercise motor control functions, particularly bilateral ones, when manifesting a response during an explicit directional SNA task. In this study we use a conflict test employing combined explicit magnitude and spatial directional processing in which pairs of numbers are placed along the diagonal axes and response accuracy/efficiency are considered across the horizontal and vertical dimensions simultaneously. Participants indicated which number in each pair was largest using a joystick that only required unilateral input. The experiment was run in English using Arabic numerals. Results showed that directional SNAs have a vertical rather than horizontal dominance. A moderating factor was also found during post-hoc analysis, where response efficiency, but not accuracy, is conditional on a person’s native language being oriented the same as the language of the experiment, left to right. The dominance of the vertical orientation suggests adopting more vertical display formats for numbers may provide situational advantages, particularly for explicit magnitude comparisons, with some domains like flight controls and the stock market already using these in some cases."
https://openalex.org/W4293103024,"A mouse testis-specific long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), Start, is localized in the cytosol of Leydig cells and in the nucleus of pachytene spermatocytes. We previously showed that Start regulates steroidogenesis through controlling the expression of Star and Hsd3b1 genes in Leydig cells, but its function in germ cells was not known. Here we verified that a spermatocyte-specific protease gene, Prss43/Tessp-3, was downregulated in Start-knockout testes. To investigate the transcriptional regulatory activity of Start in spermatocytes, we first performed a series of reporter gene assays using a thymidine kinase promoter in spermatocyte-derived GC-2spd(ts) cells. A 5.4-kb genome sequence encompassing Start exhibited enhancer activity for this promoter, and the activity was decreased by knockdown of Start. Deletion of the Start promoter and replacement of the Start sequence abolished the enhancer activity and, consistently, the activity was detected in further experiments only when Start was actively transcribed. We then examined whether the Prss43/Tessp-3 gene could be a target of Start. A reporter gene assay demonstrated that the 5.4-kb sequence exhibited enhancer activity for a Prss43/Tessp-3 promoter in GC-2spd(ts) cells and that the activity was significantly decreased by knockdown of Start. These results suggest that Start functions in transcriptional activation of the Prss43/Tessp-3 gene in spermatocytes. Given that Start is presumed to regulate steroidogenic genes at the posttranscriptional level in Leydig cells, the function in spermatocytes is a novel role of Start. These findings provide an insight into multifunctionality of lncRNAs in the testis."
https://openalex.org/W4293103030,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene that leads to respiratory complications and mortality. Studies have shown shifts in the respiratory microbiota during disease progression in individuals with CF. In addition, CF patients experience short cycles of acute intermittent aggravations of symptoms called pulmonary exacerbations, which may be characterized by a decrease in lung function and weight loss. The resident microbiota become imbalanced, promoting biofilm formation, and reducing the effectiveness of therapy. The aim of this study was to monitor patients aged 8-23 years with CF to evaluate their lower respiratory microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing. The most predominant pathogens observed in microbiota, Staphylococcus (Staph) and Pseudomonas (Pseud) were correlated with clinical variables, and the in vitro capacity of biofilm formation for these pathogens was tested. A group of 34 patients was followed up for 84 days, and 306 sputum samples were collected and sequenced. Clustering of microbiota by predominant pathogen showed that children with more Staph had reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) compared to children with Pseud. Furthermore, the patients' clinical condition was consistent with the results of pulmonary function. More patients with pulmonary exacerbation were observed in the Staph group than in the Pseud group, as confirmed by lower body mass index and pulmonary function. Additionally, prediction of bacterial functional profiles identified genes encoding key enzymes involved in virulence pathways in the Pseud group. Importantly, this study is the first Brazilian study to assess the lower respiratory microbiota in a significant group of young CF patients. In this sense, the data collected for this study on the microbiota of children in Brazil with CF provide a valuable contribution to the knowledge in the field."
https://openalex.org/W4293103389,"Introduction Medical advancements are slow to reach the patient bedside due to issues with knowledge translation from preclinical studies. Multi-laboratory preclinical studies are a promising strategy for addressing the methodological deficiencies that weaken the translational impact of single laboratory findings. However, multi-laboratory preclinical studies are rare and difficult, requiring strong collaboration to plan and execute a shared protocol. In multiteam systems such as these, collaboration is enhanced when members have cohesive ways of thinking about their goals and how to achieve them–that is, when they have “shared mental models”. In this research project, we will examine how members of Canada’s first multi-laboratory preclinical study build shared mental models and collaborate in the execution of their study. Methods Six independent labs in Canada will conduct a preclinical study using a common protocol. To investigate mental models and collaboration in this multiteam system we will conduct a longitudinal qualitative study involving interviews at four time points, team observation, and document analysis. We will analyze interview transcripts using deductive coding to produce a matrix analysis of mental model content over time and inductive coding to produce a thematic analysis of members’ experiences of collaboration over time. We will also triangulate data sources to “tell the story” of teamwork, capturing events and contextual information that explain changes in mental models and collaboration over time. Discussion This study will be one of the most comprehensive longitudinal analyses of a real-world multiteam system, and the first within a preclinical laboratory setting. The results will contribute to our understanding of collaboration in multiteam systems, an organizational form increasingly used to tackle complex scientific and social problems. The results will also inform the implementation of future multi-laboratory preclinical studies, enhancing the likelihood of effective collaboration and improved ‘bench to bedside’ translation."

https://openalex.org/W4293103771,"Background Post-systolic shortening index (PSI) is defined as myocardial shortening that occurs after aortic valve closure, and is an emerging measure of regional LV contractile dysfunction. PSI measurement variability amongst software vendor and its relationship with mechanical dyssynchrony and mechanical dispersion index (MDI) remains unknown. We evaluated PSI by speckle-tracking echocardiography from several vendors in patients with increased left ventricular wall thickness, and associations with MDI. Methods This is a prospective cross-sectional study of 70 patients (36 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [HCM], 18 cardiac amyloidosis and 16 healthy controls) undergoing clinically indicated echocardiography. PSI was measured using QLAB/aCMQ (Philips), QLAB/LV auto-trace (Philips), EchoPAC (GE), Velocity Vector Imaging (Siemens), and EchoInsight (EPSILON) software packages, and calculated as 100%×(post systolic strain–end-systole strain)/post systolic strain. Results There was a significant difference in mean PSI among controls 2.1±0.6%, HCM 6.1±2.6% and cardiac amyloidosis 6.8±2.7% (p &lt;0.001). Variations between software vendors were significant in patients with pathologic increases in LV wall thickness (for HCM p = 0.03, for amyloidosis p = 0.008), but not in controls (p = 0.11). Furthermore, there were moderate correlations between PSI and both MDI (r = 0.77) and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (r = 0.69). Conclusion PSI was greater in HCM and cardiac amyloidosis patients than controls, and a valuable tool for dyssynchrony evaluation, with moderate correlations to MDI and strain. However, there were significant variations in PSI measurements by software vendor especially in patients with pathological increase in LV wall thickness, suggesting that separate vendor-specific thresholds for abnormal PSI are required."
https://openalex.org/W4293103987,"Background Kidney transplantation is considered the ideal treatment for most people with kidney failure, conferring both survival and quality of life advantages, and is more cost effective than dialysis. Yet, current health systems may serve some people better than others, creating inequities in access to kidney failure treatments and health outcomes. AcceSS and Equity in Transplantation (ASSET) investigators aim to create a linked data platform to facilitate research enquiry into equity of health service delivery for people with kidney failure in New Zealand. Methods The New Zealand Ministry of Health will use patients’ National Health Index (NHI) numbers to deterministically link individual records held in existing registry and administrative health databases in New Zealand to create the data platform. The initial data linkage will include a study population of incident patients captured in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA), New Zealand Blood Service Database and the Australia and New Zealand Living Kidney Donor Registry (ANZLKD) from 2006 to 2019 and their linked health data. Health data sources will include National Non-Admitted Patient Collection Data, National Minimum Dataset, Cancer Registry, Programme for the Integration of Mental Health Data (PRIMHD), Pharmaceutical Claims Database and Mortality Collection Database. Initial exemplar studies include 1) kidney waitlist dynamics and pathway to transplantation; 2) impact of mental illness on accessing kidney waitlist and transplantation; 3) health service use of living donors following donation. Conclusion The AcceSS and Equity in Transplantation (ASSET) linked data platform will provide opportunity for population-based health services research to examine equity in health care delivery and health outcomes in New Zealand. It also offers potential to inform future service planning by identifying where improvements can be made in the current health system to promote equity in access to health services for those in New Zealand."
https://openalex.org/W4293104228,"This paper addresses the question of the effectiveness and permanence of temporary incentives to contribute to a public good. Using a common experimental framework, we investigate the effects of a recommendation that takes the form of an exhortative message to contribute, a monetary punishment and a non-monetary reward to sustain high levels of contributions. In particular, we shed light on the differential impact these mechanisms have on heterogeneous types of agents. The results show that all three incentives increase contributions compared to a pre-phase where there is no incentive. Monetary sanctions lead to the highest contributions, but a sudden drop in contributions is observed once the incentive to punish is removed. On the contrary, Recommendation leads to the lowest contributions but maintains a long-lasting impact in the Post-policy phase. In particular, it makes free-riders increase their contribution over time in the post-incentive phase. Finally, non-monetary reward backfires against those who are weakly conditional cooperators. Our findings emphasize the importance of designing and maintaining incentives not only for free-riders, but for strong and weak conditional cooperators as well, depending on characteristics of the incentives."
https://openalex.org/W4293104721,"Objective The aim of this study is to analyse the effectiveness of the Graded Motor Imagery (GraMI) protocol in phantom limb pain in amputee patients. Materials and methods A randomised clinical trial will be conducted, with two parallel groups and simple blinding, and a phenomenological study with semi-structured interviews. People over the age of 18, with amputation of one limb, with a minimum score of 3 on the visual analogue scale of pain, who are pharmacologically stable and have been discharged from hospital, will be recruited. An initial assessment, a post-intervention assessment (9 weeks) and a follow-up assessment (12 weeks post-intervention) will be performed, in which pain, quality of life, functionality and psychological aspects will be assessed. The aim of the qualitative study is to find out about the experience of living with phantom limb pain and to identify the satisfaction with the intervention. A descriptive, univariate and bivariate quantitative statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS program, with a 95% confidence level and a statistical significance level of p &lt; 0.05. The qualitative analysis will be carried out using the Atlas.ti 8.0 program, where the different interviews will be analysed, coded and categorised. Discussion The GraMI protocol allows the patient to work on motor learning through brain reorganisation, analytical movements, sensory stimulation, and functional activities. In addition, it can help to standardise the use of graded motor imagery in future studies and in clinical practice with this patient profile. Trial registration NCT05083611 ."
https://openalex.org/W4293105132,"Background Tissue adhesives are an alternative to conventional surgical sutures to reduce the time and cost of wound closure and to improve patient comfort. The use of tissue adhesives does not require any subsequent intervention and significantly lowers the volume and rate of blood loss, and reduces the need for transfusions during and after surgery. However, based on their formulation, tissue adhesives’ safety profile and functional properties may differ. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the basic safety and performance of NE’X Glue® Surgical Sealant, BioGlue® Surgical Sealant, and PREVELEAK TM Surgical Sealant in vitro . Methods The basic safety of commercially available tissue adhesives was evaluated using MEM elution assay according to ISO 10993–5 and endotoxin level according to 85. USP. The in vitro performance was evaluated using lap-shear by tension loading test, burst strength test, degradation, and swelling assays. Results NE’X Glue®, BioGlue®, and PREVELEAK TM did not cause cytotoxicity in MEM elution assay. All surgical adhesives are below the general limit of endotoxin contamination of 20 EU/device. NE’X Glue® and BioGlue® showed the highest and comparable strength properties in lap shear and burst strength tests compared to PREVELEAK TM . NE’X Glue® and PREVELEAK TM are characterized by lower degradation potential than BioGlue®. PREVELEAK TM is characterized by the highest swelling when compared to NE’X Glue® and BioGlue®. Conclusions NE’X Glue® is most versatile in terms of functional properties while maintaining the same safety profile as BioGlue® and PREVELEAK TM ."
https://openalex.org/W4293105174,"This study aimed to explore which offensive variables best discriminate the ball possession duration according to players specific role (defenders, midfielders, attackers) during a Gk+3vs3+Gk football small-sided games. Fifteen under-15 players (age 13.2±1.0 years, playing experience 4.2±1.0 years) were grouped according to their positions (team of defenders, n = 5; team of midfielders, n = 7; team of attackers, n = 3). On each testing day (n = 3), each team performed one bout of 5-min against each team in a random order, accounting for a total of nine bouts in the following scenarios: i) defenders vs midfielders; ii) defenders vs attackers; iii) midfielders vs attackers. Based on video, a notational analysis process allowed to capture individual and collective actions. According to each playing position group, discriminant analysis was used to identify relevant variables that discriminate different ball possession sequences (short, medium, and long). The analysis revealed the existence of three clusters according to ball possession duration, classified as short sequence (~4 seconds), medium sequence (~10 seconds) and long sequence (~18 seconds). The number of touches per possession was the variable that discriminates the ball possession duration from all playing positions while passing actions were related to midfielders and attackers. In addition, different ball possessions sequences in the attackers were also discriminated by the number of players involved per possession. Accordingly, to increase the duration of the offensive phase during small-sided games, coaches should foster the players’ ability to stay on the ball, as it may amplify their opportunities to maintain the ball possession. In addition, coaches may also include reward rules to encourage midfielders and attackers’ passing actions and the number of attackers involved during the attack to promote longer ball possessions durations."
https://openalex.org/W4293105326,"Visual object tracking is a critical problem in the field of computer vision. The visual object tracker methods can be divided into Correlation Filters (CF) and non-correlation filters trackers. The main advantage of CF-based trackers is that they have an accepted real-time tracking response. In this article, we will focus on CF-based trackers, due to their key role in online applications such as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), through two contributions. In the first contribution, we proposed a set of new video sequences to address two uncovered issues of the existing standard datasets. The first issue is to create two video sequence that is difficult to be tracked by a human being for the movement of the Amoeba under the microscope; these two proposed video sequences include a new feature that combined background clutter and occlusion features in a unique way; we called it hard-to-follow-by-human . The second issue is to increase the difficulty of the existing sequences by increasing the displacement of the tracked object. Then, we proposed a thorough, practical evaluation of eight CF-base trackers, with the top performance, on the existing sequence features such as out-of-view, background clutters, and fast motion. The evaluation utilized the well-known OTB-2013 dataset as well as the proposed video sequences. The overall assessment of the eight trackers on the standard evaluation metrics, e.g., precision and success rates, revealed that the Large Displacement Estimation of Similarity transformation (LDES) tracker is the best CF-based tracker among the trackers of comparison. On the contrary, with a deeper analysis, the results of the proposed video sequences show an average performance of the LDES tracker among the other trackers. The eight trackers failed to capture the moving objects in every frame of the proposed Amoeba movement video sequences while the same trackers managed to capture the object in almost every frame of the sequences of the standard dataset. These results outline the need to improve the CF-based object trackers to be able to process sequences with the proposed feature (i.e., hard-to-follow-by-human )."
https://openalex.org/W4293105521,"When animals are previously exposed to two different visual stimuli simultaneously, their learning performance at discriminating those stimuli delays: such a phenomenon is known as “classifying-together” or “Bateson effect”. However, the consistency of this phenomenon has not been wholly endorsed, especially considering the evidence collected in several vertebrates. The current study addressed whether a teleost fish, Xenotoca eiseni , was liable to the Bateson effect. Three experiments were designed, by handling the visual stimuli (i.e., a full red disk, an amputated red disk, a red cross) and the presence of an exposure phase, before performing a discriminative learning task (Exp. 1: full red disk vs. amputated red disk; Exp. 2: full red disk vs. red cross). In the exposure phase, three conditions per pairs of training stimuli were arranged: “congruence”, where fish were exposed and trained to choose the same stimulus; “wide-incongruence”, where fish were exposed to one stimulus and trained to choose the other one; “narrow-incongruence”, where fish were exposed to both the stimuli and trained to choose one of them. In the absence of exposure (Exp. 3), the discrimination learning task was carried out to establish a baseline performance as regards the full red disk vs. amputated red disk, and the full red disk vs. red cross. Results showed that fish ran into retardation effects at learning when trained to choose a novel stimulus with respect to the one experienced during the exposure-phase (wide-incongruence condition), as well as after being simultaneously exposed to both stimuli (narrow-incongruence condition). Furthermore, there were no facilitation effects due to the congruence compared with the baseline: in such a case, familiar stimuli did not ease the performance at learning. The study provides the first evidence about the consistency of the classifying-together effect in a fish species, further highlighting the impact of visual similarities on discrimination processes."
https://openalex.org/W4293105791,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of infection clusters associated with choral singing have been reported. Singing generates droplets and carries the risk of spreading infection. However, no reports have explored droplet flight and aerosol production rates by singing and speaking in Japanese. First, we conducted an observation experiment evaluating the maximum flight distance and number of droplets generated by singing in Japanese, using a high-speed camera and particle counter. Twenty amateur choir members, 10 male and 10 female (five members for each of the four voices), participated in the experiment. Subsequently, although the maximum distance that droplets traveled by singing in Japanese was 61 cm for men (median of 46.5, interquartile range, 36–57) and 56 cm for women (median of 27.5, interquartile range, 20–50), droplets were observed anteriorly and laterally to be up to 66.8 cm. At the singer’s mouth, ≥ 5 μm droplets were observed, whereas not observed at 1 meter toward the front of the singers in women and men, respectively. In German singing, droplets were observed up to 111 cm toward the front of the singer, possibly reflecting differences in pronunciation. In Japanese reading aloud, droplets were also observed up to 47 cm toward the front, whereas no droplet dispersion was observed by speaking the Japanese /a/ vowel or singing with wearing surgical mask toward the front. The aerosols produced when reading singing the /u/ vowels were significantly higher than those in other vowels. When singing in a choral group, keeping a sufficient distance at the front and side is recommended in minimizing infectious spread. If distance is not possible, practicing with /a/ vowels and avoiding consonants may be an alternative method. Our observations lasted only 50 seconds per song, and further observational studies are needed to determine the dynamics of aerosols that stay for long periods."
https://openalex.org/W4293105801,"Menopause, which may accelerate the hallmarks of the natural aging process, represents a point in time characterized by the permanent cessation of menstruation following the loss of ovarian estrogen production. Unlike natural menopause, which is characterized by a gradual decrease in estrogen production, when both ovaries are removed before the natural age of menopause, the onset of estrogen deprivation is abrupt. Further, a decrease in genome methylation frequently occurs in aging cells, and the major interspersed repetitive DNA elements in humans are Alu elements. In blood cells, Alu demethylation starts at an age of approximately 40 years, and increases with age. Here, we explored the Alu methylation levels corresponding to age-matched pre-menopausal, naturally postmenopausal, and surgically postmenopausal women aged 45-55 years (n = 60 in each group). Our results indicated that the body mass index (BMI), time-since-menopause, and Alu methylation levels corresponding to the three groups were significantly different. However, no correlations between Alu methylation level and BMI, time-since-menopause, or age were observed. Additionally, the Alu methylation level corresponding to the natural post-menopause group was significantly lower those corresponding to the pre-menopausal (p = 0.001) and surgical post-menopausal (p = 0.037) groups. In conclusion, Alu hypomethylation occurs in naturally postmenopausal women, implying that when women reach the age of natural menopause, the cell aging process may progress significantly with genome hypomethylation. These findings, notwithstanding, further studies are necessary to clarify whether bilateral oophorectomy before the age of menopause affects the cell aging process to a greater extent than natural menopause, and whether estrogen therapy or other interventions can delay cell aging in this regard."
