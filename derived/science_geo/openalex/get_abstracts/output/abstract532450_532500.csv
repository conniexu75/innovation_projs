https://openalex.org/W784773356,"High blood pressure (HBP) is the leading risk factor for years of life lost in Brazil. Factors associated with HBP awareness, treatment and control need to be understood better. Our aim is to estimate prevalence, awareness, and types of anti-hypertensive treatment and to investigate the association of HBP control with social position. Data of 15,103 (54% female) civil servants in six Brazilian state capitals collected at the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) baseline (2008-2010) were used to estimate prevalence and cross-sectional association of HBP control with education, per capita family income and self-reported race, using multiple logistic regression. Blood pressure was measured by the oscillometric method. 35.8% were classified as presenting HBP; 76.8% of these used anti-hypertensive medication. Women were more aware than men (84.8% v. 75.8%) and more often using medication (83.1% v. 70.7%). Adjusted HBP prevalence was, in ascending order, Whites (30.3%), Browns (38.2%) and Blacks (49.3%). The therapeutic schemes most used were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in isolation (12.4%) or combined with diuretics (13.3%). Among those in drug treatment, controlled blood pressure was more likely in the (postgraduate) higher education group than among participants with less than secondary school education (PR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.14-1.28), and among Asian (PR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.12-1.32) and 'Whites (PR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.12-1.26) compared to Blacks. Socioeconomic and racial inequality-as measured by different indicators-are strongly associated with HBP control, beyond the expected influence of health services access."
https://openalex.org/W809832448,"Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGB) induce positive effects in plants, for instance, increased growth and reduced abiotic stresses susceptibility. The mechanisms by which these bacteria impact the host plant are numerous, diverse and often specific. Here, we studied the agronomical, molecular and biochemical effects of the endophytic PGB Bacillus subtilis B26 on the full life cycle of Brachypodium distachyon Bd21, an established model species for functional genomics in cereal crops and temperate grasses. Inoculation of Brachypodium with B. subtilis strain B26 increased root and shoot weights, accelerated growth rate and seed yield as compared to control plants. B. subtilis strain B26 efficiently colonized the plant and was recovered from roots, stems and blades as well as seeds of Brachypodium, indicating that the bacterium is able to migrate, spread systemically inside the plant, establish itself in the aerial plant tissues and organs, and is vertically transmitted to seeds. The presence of B. subtilis strain B26 in the seed led to systemic colonization of the next generation of Brachypodium plants. Inoculated Brachypodium seedlings and mature plants exposed to acute and chronic drought stress minimized the phenotypic effect of drought compared to plants not harbouring the bacterium. Protection from the inhibitory effects of drought by the bacterium was linked to upregulation of the drought-response genes, DREB2B-like, DHN3-like and LEA-14-A-like and modulation of the DNA methylation genes, MET1B-like, CMT3-like and DRM2-like, that regulate the process. Additionally, total soluble sugars and starch contents increased in stressed inoculated plants, a biochemical indication of drought tolerance. In conclusion, we show a single inoculation of Brachypodium with a PGB affected the whole growth cycle of the plant, accelerating its growth rates, shortening its vegetative period, and alleviating drought stress effects. These effects are relevant to grasses and cereal crops."
https://openalex.org/W2249416944,"In the research realm of game theory, interdependent networks have extended the content of spatial reciprocity, which needs the suitable coupling between networks. However, thus far, the vast majority of existing works just assume that the coupling strength between networks is symmetric. This hypothesis, to some extent, seems inconsistent with the ubiquitous observation of heterogeneity. Here, we study how the heterogeneous coupling strength, which characterizes the interdependency of utility between corresponding players of both networks, affects the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game with two types of coupling schemes (symmetric and asymmetric ones). Compared with the traditional case, we show that heterogeneous coupling greatly promotes the collective cooperation. The symmetric scheme seems much better than the asymmetric case. Moreover, the role of varying amplitude of coupling strength is also studied on these two interdependent ways. Current findings are helpful for us to understand the evolution of cooperation within many real-world systems, in particular for the interconnected and interrelated systems."
https://openalex.org/W1903696312,"This study underlines the importance of cinnamon, a commonly used natural spice and flavoring material, and its metabolite sodium benzoate (NaB) in attenuating oxidative stress and protecting memory and learning in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). NaB, but not sodium formate, was found to inhibit LPS-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mouse microglial cells. Similarly, NaB also inhibited fibrillar amyloid beta (Aβ)- and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium(+)-induced microglial production of ROS. Although NaB reduced the level of cholesterol in vivo in mice, reversal of the inhibitory effect of NaB on ROS production by mevalonate, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not cholesterol, suggests that depletion of intermediates, but not end products, of the mevalonate pathway is involved in the antioxidant effect of NaB. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an inhibitor of p21rac geranylgeranyl protein transferase suppressed the production of ROS and that NaB suppressed the activation of p21rac in microglia. As expected, marked activation of p21rac was observed in the hippocampus of subjects with AD and 5XFAD transgenic (Tg) mouse model of AD. However, oral feeding of cinnamon (Cinnamonum verum) powder and NaB suppressed the activation of p21rac and attenuated oxidative stress in the hippocampus of Tg mice as evident by decreased dihydroethidium (DHE) and nitrotyrosine staining, reduced homocysteine level and increased level of reduced glutathione. This was accompanied by suppression of neuronal apoptosis, inhibition of glial activation, and reduction of Aβ burden in the hippocampus and protection of memory and learning in transgenic mice. Therefore, cinnamon powder may be a promising natural supplement in halting or delaying the progression of AD."
https://openalex.org/W842918338,"Background and Objectives Anti-hypertensive treatment with the angiotensin II receptor antagonist olmesartan is a rare cause of severe Sprue-like enteropathy. To substantiate the hypothesis that olmesartan interferes with gut immune homeostasis, clinical, histopathological and immune features were compared in olmesartan-induced-enteropathy (OIE) and in autoimmune enteropathy (AIE). Methods Medical files of seven patients with OIE and 4 patients with AIE enrolled during the same period were retrospectively reviewed. Intestinal biopsies were collected for central histopathological review, T cell Receptor clonality and flow cytometric analysis of isolated intestinal lymphocytes. Results Among seven olmesartan-treated patients who developed villous atrophy refractory to a gluten free diet, three had extra-intestinal autoimmune diseases, two had antibodies reacting with the 75 kilodalton antigen characteristic of AIE and one had serum anti-goblet cell antibodies. Small intestinal lesions and signs of intestinal lymphocyte activation were thus reminiscent of the four cases of AIE diagnosed during the same period. Before olmesartan discontinuation, remission was induced in all patients (7/7) by immunosuppressive drugs. After interruption of both olmesartan and immunosuppressive drugs in six patients, remission was maintained in 4 but anti-TNF-α therapy was needed in two. Conclusion This case-series shows that olmesartan can induce intestinal damage mimicking AIE. OIE usually resolved after olmesartan interruption but immunosuppressive drugs may be necessary to achieve remission. Our data sustain the hypothesis that olmesartan interferes with intestinal immuno regulation in predisposed individuals."
https://openalex.org/W845550853,"Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by increased pulmonary artery pressure and carries an increased mortality. Population-based studies into pulmonary hypertension are scarce and little is known about its prevalence in the general population. We aimed to describe the distribution of echocardiographically-assessed pulmonary artery systolic pressure (ePASP) in the general population, to estimate the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension, and to identify associated factors.Participants (n = 3381, mean age 76.4 years, 59% women) from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort, underwent echocardiography. Echocardiographic pulmonary hypertension was defined as ePASP>40 mmHg.Mean ePASP was 26.3 mmHg (SD 7.0). Prevalence of echocardiographic pulmonary hypertension was 2.6% (95%CI: 2.0; 3.2). Prevalence was higher in older participants compared to younger ones (8.3% in those over 85 years versus 0.8% in those between 65 and 70), and in those with underlying disorders versus those without (5.9% in subjects with COPD versus 2.3%; 9.2% in those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction versus 2.3%; 23.1% in stages 3 or 4 left ventricular diastolic dysfunction versus 1.9% in normal or stage 1). Factors independently associated with higher ePASP were older age, higher BMI, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, COPD and systemic hypertension.In this large population-based study, we show that pulmonary hypertension as measured by echocardiography has a low prevalence in the overall general population in the Netherlands, but estimates may be higher in specific subgroups, especially in those with underlying diseases. Increased pulmonary arterial pressure is likely to gain importance in the near future due to population aging and the accompanying prevalences of underlying disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1649415996,"Marine dinitrogen (N2) fixation studies have focused nearly exclusively on cyanobacterial diazotrophs; however γ-proteobacteria are an abundant component of the marine community and have been largely overlooked until recently. Here we present a phylogenetic analysis of all nifH γ-proteobacterial sequences available in public databases and qPCR data of a γ-proteobacterial phylotype, Gamma A (UMB), obtained during several research cruises. Our analysis revealed a complex diversity of diazotrophic γ-proteobacteria. One phylotype in particular, Gamma A, was described in several traditional and quantitative PCR studies. Though several γ-proteobacterial nifH sequences have been described as laboratory contaminants, Gamma A is part of a large cluster of sequences isolated from marine environments and distantly related to the clade of contaminants. Using a TaqMan probe and primer set, Gamma A nifH DNA abundance and expression were analyzed in nearly 1000 samples collected during 15 cruises to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The data showed that Gamma A is an active, cosmopolitan diazotroph found throughout oxygenated, oligotrophic waters reaching maximum abundances of 8 x 104 nifH DNA copies l-1 and 5 x 105 nifH transcript copies l-1. Gamma A nifH transcript abundances were on average 3 fold higher than nifH DNA abundances. The widespread distribution and activity of Gamma A indicate that it has potential to be a globally important N2 fixing organism."
https://openalex.org/W1659618367,"Cullin-Ring ubiquitin ligases regulate protein turnover by promoting the ubiquitination of substrate proteins, targeting them for proteasomal degradation. It has been shown previously that mutations in Cullin3 (Cul3) causing deletion of 57 amino acids encoded by exon 9 (Cul3Δ9) cause hypertension. Moreover, RhoA activity contributes to vascular constriction and hypertension. We show that ubiquitination and degradation of RhoA is dependent on Cul3 in HEK293T cells in which Cul3 expression is ablated by either siRNA or by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. The latter was used to generate a Cul3-null cell line (HEK293TCul3KO). When expressed in these cells, Cul3Δ9 supported reduced ubiquitin ligase activity toward RhoA compared with equivalent levels of wild-type Cul3 (Cul3WT). Consistent with its reduced activity, binding of Cul3Δ9 to the E3 ubiquitin ligase Rbx1 and neddylation of Cul3Δ9 were impaired significantly compared with Cul3WT. Conversely, Cul3Δ9 bound to substrate adaptor proteins more efficiently than Cul3WT. Cul3Δ9 also forms unstable dimers with Cul3WT, disrupting dimers of Cul3WT complexes that are required for efficient ubiquitination of some substrates. Indeed, coexpression of Cul3WT and Cul3Δ9 in HEK293TCul3KO cells resulted in a decrease in the active form of Cul3WT. We conclude that Cul3Δ9-associated ubiquitin ligase activity toward RhoA is impaired and suggest that Cul3Δ9 mutations may act dominantly by sequestering substrate adaptors and disrupting Cul3WT complexes.

https://openalex.org/W1605392557,"It is widely accepted that overactivation of NMDA receptors, resulting in calcium overload and consequent mitochondrial dysfunction in retinal ganglion neurons, plays a significant role in promoting neurodegenerative disorders such as glaucoma. Calcium has been shown to initiate a transient hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential triggering a burst of reactive oxygen species leading to apoptosis. Strategies that enhance cell survival signaling pathways aimed at preventing this adverse hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential may provide a novel therapeutic intervention in retinal disease. In the retina, brain-derived neurotrophic factor has been shown to be neuroprotective, and our group previously reported a PSD-95/PDZ-binding cyclic peptide (CN2097) that augments brain-derived neurotrophic factor-induced pro-survival signaling. Here, we examined the neuroprotective properties of CN2097 using an established retinal in vivo NMDA toxicity model. CN2097 completely attenuated NMDA-induced caspase 3-dependent and -independent cell death and PARP-1 activation pathways, blocked necrosis, and fully prevented the loss of long term ganglion cell viability. Although neuroprotection was partially dependent upon CN2097 binding to the PDZ domain of PSD-95, our results show that the polyarginine-rich transport moiety C-R(7), linked to the PDZ-PSD-95-binding cyclic peptide, was sufficient to mediate short and long term protection via a mitochondrial targeting mechanism. C-R(7) localized to mitochondria and was found to reduce mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and the generation of reactive oxygen species, promoting survival of retinal neurons.

We found that CN2097 increased the association of PSD-95 with the neurotrophin receptor TrkB to augment brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced signaling, leading to increased AKT and CREB activation, and facilitation of long term potentiation (LTP) (24Cao C.

In addition, the polyarginine-rich transport moiety C-R(7) alone, independent of the PDZ-PSD-95-binding cyclic peptide of CN2097, was identified to attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in protection against NMDA-induced death.

The peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC, lyophilized, and exchanged with HCl. Disulfide linkage between the peptides was conducted in the solution phase using cysteine-containing linear peptides.

For example, the individual peptides containing cysteine were synthesized on a solid support. The activation of cysteine was performed during cleavage using 2,2′-dithiodipyridine (5 eq) in cleavage mixture (TFA/triisopropylsilane/H2O, 95:2.5:2.5, v/v/v). The peptides were purified and lyophilized. A number of peptides were synthesized using this strategy, such as C-s-s-C-R(7), C-s-s-C-R(5), C-s-s-C-R(3), C-s-s-C-K(7), DC-s-s-DCDR(7), C-s-s-C-R(7)-biotin, C-s-s-C-R(7)-FAM, C-s-s-C-Tat, and C-R(7). The macrocyclic peptide in CN2097, CN5135, and CN1105 was synthesized, as reported previously (22LeBlanc B.W. Iwata M. Mallon A.P. Rupasinghe C.N. Goebel D.J. Marshall J. Spaller M.R. Saab C.Y.

The fatty acyl derivatives of macrocyclic peptides CN2180 and CN3200 were synthesized with coupling of myristic anhydride at the N terminus. The coupling of carboxyfluorescein in CN3205 was achieved at the polyethylene linker attached to the side chain of the lysine residue at the N terminus followed by coupling of the myristic acid chain at the N terminus. Similarly, the rhodamine derivative CN6005 was synthesized by coupling of 6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine at the polyethylene glycol linker at the lysine side chain residue followed by coupling of multiple arginines at the N terminus.TABLE 1Nomenclature for linear peptidesR(7)RRRRRRR-amideC-R(7)CRRRRRRR-amideC-s-s-C-R(7)C-s-s-CRRRRRRR-amideC-s-s-C-R(5)C-s-s-CRRRRR-amideC-s-s-C-R(3)C-s-s-CRRR-amideDC-s-s-DCDR(7)DC-s-s-DCDRDRDRDRDRDRDR-amideC-s-s-C-R(7)-biotinC-s-s-CRRRRRRR- (C2-linker)-biotinC-s-s-C-R(7)-FAMC-s-s-CRRRRRRRK- (apen-FAM)TatYGRKKRRQRR-amideC-s-s-C-TatC-s-s-CYGRKKRRQRR-amideTat-NR2B9cYGRKKRRQRRKLSSIESDV-amideLin-CN2097Amide-RRRRRRRC-s-s-CKNYKKTEV-amideLin-CN5135Amide-RRRRRRRC-s-s-CKNYKKAEA-amide Open table in a new tab All of the peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC, lyophilized, and exchanged with HCl. Peptide purity was in the range of 90–95% as determined using high resolution time of flight AXIMA performance MALDI TOF-TOF mass spectrometer (Shimadzu). Male Sprague-Dawley rats of 225–250 g were obtained from Charles River. All animal procedures and care were performed following IACUC-approved protocols in compliance with United States Department of Agriculture guidelines and with those prescribed by the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane after which the eyes were given a 3-μl intravitreal pre-injection containing either the designated peptide/vehicle or vehicle alone (0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2), as described previously (26Goebel D.J. Winkler B.S. Blockade of PARP activity attenuates poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation but offers only partial neuroprotection against NMDA-induced cell death in the rat retina.J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1732-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, 2 h following the pre-injection, the reanesthetized animals were given a second intravitreal injection containing 20 nmol of NMDA dissolved in vehicle, with or without the inclusion of the designated peptide. Survival times and retinal processing following NMDA insult are detailed below. Optimal dosing of the CN2097, CN2180, and negative control CN3200 for the in vivo retinal toxicity model were determined by quantitatively assessing the attenuation of NMDA-induced PAR formation by performing Western blot analyses, as described previously (26Goebel D.J. Winkler B.S. Blockade of PARP activity attenuates poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation but offers only partial neuroprotection against NMDA-induced cell death in the rat retina.J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1732-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All blots were digitally scanned for densitometric analysis using ImageJ software. Quantification of PAR immunoreactivity for each individually treated retina was normalized to β-actin signal. Freshly obtained posterior eyecups from treated animals were stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr) as described previously (26Goebel D.J. Winkler B.S.

Equal 1.5-mm-wide swatch across each retina, through the optic nerve head, was digitally photographed in montage format using a Zeiss Apotome microscope equipped with a rhodamine fluorescence filter pack, using ×20 objective. Labeling distributions were determined by manually counting EtBr-stained cells in the GCL and normalized to the area sampled. Previous studies have shown that multiple populations of ganglion and displaced amacrine cells are susceptible to NMDA-induced loss of plasma membrane selectivity (LPMS) and that their distributions (converted to number of EtBr cells/mm2) surrounding the optic nerve head between 0.5 and 3 mm eccentricities are relatively constant (29Goebel D.J.

For long term protection studies, retinal ganglion cell viability was assessed using the retrograde dye fluorogold (Fluorochrome LLC, Denver, CO). Fourteen days following intravitreal injections of the designated peptide and NMDA, rats were anesthetized with xylazine/ketamine, and the incision site was prepped for surgery following IACUC-approved guidelines. The superior surface of the cranium was exposed, whereby two portals, corresponding to the positioning of the right and left superior colliculi, were obtained using a high speed drill. The dura mater was cut away, and a 2-mm diameter core of overlying cortex was aspirated off to expose the superior surface of each colliculi. Twenty five microliters of a 4% aqueous solution of fluorogold was absorbed into an equal sized portion of sterile powered gel foam with half being applied onto the exposed surface of each superior colliculi. The access portals were sealed with bone wax followed by the scalp being sutured closed. All animals were closely monitored for both food and water intake, pain/distress, weight loss, and inactivity according to IACUC guidelines, and those few that did present complications were removed from the study. Four days following this surgery, rats were euthanized, and the retinas were quickly dissected, fixed, and flat mounted onto glass slides. All retinas were digitally photographed in their entirety using montage formatting with a Zeiss Apotome, microscope equipped with a DAPI filter pack, and ×10 objective. Each reconstructed retinal montage was regionally subdivided into four regions defined by spacing of 1-mm concentric rings, centered about the optic nerve head and used to bin fluorogold-labeled ganglion cell distributions. Previous studies have shown that caspase-3 activation in the retina peaks 2 h following an intravitreal injection of 20 nmol of NMDA (29Goebel D.J. Selective blockade of CaMKII-α inhibits NMDA-induced caspase-3-dependent cell death but does not arrest PARP-1 activation or loss of plasma membrane selectivity in rat retinal neurons.Brain Res. 2009; 1256: 190-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Utilizing the membrane-permeable peptide carboxyfluorescein-peptide valylalanyl aspartic acid-fluoromethyl ketone (FAM-VAD-FMK), which specifically and irreversibly binds in situ to activated caspases 1, 3, 4 and 7, we quantitatively evaluated selected peptides for their respective ability to block NMDA-induced caspase activation using our established in vivo retinal toxicity model. Rat eyes were given a single intravitreal injection containing one of the following treatments, 3 nmol of the designated peptide in the presence of 20 nmol of NMDA, 20 nmol of NMDA alone, or vehicle alone. One hour following the intravitreal injection, each rat received a 100-μl intravenous tail vein injection containing ∼8 μg of FAM-FLIVO (ImmunoChemistry Technologies, Bloomington, MN), freshly prepared under sterile conditions. Two hours following intravitreal injections, the eyes were quickly dissected and fixed as above. Retinas were then flat mounted, ganglion cell side up, and photographed in montage format incorporating a 1-mm-thick band that passed though the optic nerve head on a temporal-nasal path using ×20 objective and a FITC filter pack. The distribution of FLAVO-positive cells was manually counted from each image, converted to number of cells/mm2, and averaged for each treated retina. Male Sprague-Dawley rats about 2 months of age were used. Prior to each experiment, the animal was dark-adapted overnight in a ventilated lightproof box. Under dim red light, the animal was euthanized using CO2 inhalation followed by pneumothorax. Eyes were removed and hemisected. Following vitrectomy using forceps, each eyecup was put in Ames' medium at room temperature gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2, cut in two halves, and allowed to dark-adapt for at least 1 h. Under infrared illumination using night vision devices (NiteMate NAV-3, Litton Industries, Watertown, CT) attached to the eyepieces of a dissecting microscope, a piece of retina was isolated from an eye cup using a paint brush and flattened on an MEA with the RGC side down. The MEA contained 60 30-μm diameter electrodes at a center-to-center spacing of 200 μm (Multi Channel Systems, Germany). The retina was continuously superfused at 3 ml/min with Ames' medium gassed with 95% O2 5% CO2 and maintained at 33 °C with a temperature controller, and it was kept in darkness except during light stimulation. All photoresponse data were collected after the retina had been superfused for at least 100 min. The stimuli were 1-s full-field 480 nm light generated by a monochromator (Optical Building Blocks, Birmingham, NJ). The timing of stimulus presentation was controlled by an electromechanical shutter built into this monochromator. Light intensity was adjusted by a continuously variable neutral density filter (Newport Corp., Franklin, MA). The intensity-adjusted light was delivered via a fiber optic cable to the retina from below the MEA superfusion chamber. The unattenuated light intensity (i.e. −0 log I) was 4.1 × 1015 photons cm−2 s−1 at the retina. Drugs were applied by adding stock solutions to the superfusion reservoir. For each drug condition, the retina was superfused with the drug for 25–30 min prior to light testing. MEA recordings were amplified, filtered with cutoffs at 200 and 3 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz using MC Rack software (Multi Channel Systems). The raw recordings from all 60 channels were saved onto a computer for off-line analysis. To quantify photoresponse amplitudes, traditional cluster analysis of spiking activity could not be used because in many channels the effect of NMDA application was a dramatic reduction in spike amplitude, not just a change in spike rate (see Fig. 9a). Instead, we used MathWorks MATLAB software (Natick, MA) to calculate the variance of the recording during the 1-s light stimulus and of the recording during the second before light-stimulus onset. The difference between these variances was used as the photoresponse amplitude (Fig. 9a). For each data point in the plots, the light-induced variance differences for all 60 channels were averaged, and the error bars represent S.E. HEK293 cells were grown to 50% confluence in DMEM (Gibco), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated with 1 nm C-R(7)-biotin for 2.5 h in fresh media at 37 °C. MitoTracker Red was added to the media to a final concentration of 500 nm, for an additional 30 min. Following aspiration, the cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and washed with PBS. Slides were prepared by cytospin (Cyto-Tek, Rankin) at 600 rpm. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, dehydrated with graded alcohol, and cured overnight at room temperature. Mounted slides were preincubated with ChemiBLOCKER (Millipore) solution for 1 h, exposed to the streptavidin-Alexa 488 antibody (1:250 dilution) for 2 h, and stained with DAPI. Images were digitally photographed using a Leica TCS SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc, Buffalo Grove IL) with ×100 water objective. HEK293 cells were seeded 24 h before the measurements, trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in DMEM (without phenol red, FBS, and antibiotics) on ice. DMEM was removed after centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in measuring buffer (120 mm KCl, 3 mm HEPES, 5 mm KPi, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Respiration was measured at 35 °C in a closed oxygen electrode chamber (Oxygraph System, Hansatech) with a final volume of 500 μl following addition of 10 mm succinate as substrate, 3 mm ADP to induce state 3 respiration, and 6"

However, integrated research simultaneously investigating macrofauna, microbes and N-cycling is lacking. We investigated spatio-temporal patterns in microbial community composition and diversity, macrofaunal abundance and their sediment reworking activity, and N-cycling in seven subtidal stations in the Southern North Sea.Our results indicated that bacteria (total and β-AOB) showed more spatio-temporal variation than archaea (total and AOA) as sedimentation of organic matter and the subsequent changes in the environment had a stronger impact on their community composition and diversity indices in our study area. However, spatio-temporal patterns of total bacterial and β-AOB communities were different and related to the availability of ammonium for the autotrophic β-AOB. Highest bacterial richness and diversity were observed in June at the timing of the phytoplankton bloom deposition, while richness of β-AOB as well as AOA peaked in September. Total archaeal community showed no temporal variation in diversity indices.Distance based linear models revealed that, independent from the effect of grain size and the quality and quantity of sediment organic matter, nitrification and N-mineralization were affected by respectively the diversity of metabolically active β-AOB and AOA, and the total bacteria, near the sediment-water interface. Separate models demonstrated a significant and independent effect of macrofaunal activities on community composition and richness of total bacteria, and diversity indices of metabolically active AOA. Diversity of β-AOB was significantly affected by macrofaunal abundance. Our results support the link between microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in marine sediments, and provided broad correlative support for the hypothesis that this relationship is modulated by macrofaunal activity. We hypothesized that the latter effect can be explained by their bioturbating and bio-irrigating activities, increasing the spatial complexity of the biogeochemical environment."
https://openalex.org/W1846125448,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors including obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance (IR) is the central feature of MetS. Recent studies suggest that MetS is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved fuel-sensing enzyme and a key player in regulating energy metabolism. In this report, we examined the role of IR on the regulation of AMPK phosphorylation and AMPK-mediated Tau phosphorylation. We found that AMPKSer-485, but not AMPKThr-172, phosphorylation is increased in the cortex of db/db and high fat diet-fed obese mice, two mouse models of IR. In vitro, treatment of human cortical stem cell line (HK-5320) and primary mouse embryonic cortical neurons with the AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), induced AMPK phosphorylation at both Thr-172 and Ser-485. AMPK activation also triggered Tau dephosphorylation. When IR was mimicked in vitro by chronically treating the cells with insulin, AICAR specifically induced AMPKSer-485, but not AMPKThr-172, hyperphosphorylation whereas AICAR-induced Tau dephosphorylation was inhibited. IR also resulted in the overactivation of Akt by AICAR treatment; however, preventing Akt overactivation during IR prevented AMPKSer-485 hyperphosphorylation and restored AMPK-mediated Tau dephosphorylation. Transfection of AMPKS485A mutant caused similar results. Therefore, our results suggest the following mechanism for the adverse effect of IR on AD pathology: IR → chronic overactivation of Akt → AMPKSer-485 hyperphosphorylation → inhibition of AMPK-mediated Tau dephosphorylation. Together, our results show for the first time a possible contribution of IR-induced AMPKSer-485 phosphorylation to the increased risk of AD in obesity and diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2215126364,"Background Several approaches have been used to express energy expenditure in youth, but no consensus exists as to which best normalizes data for the wide range of ages and body sizes across a range of physical activities. This study examined several common metrics for expressing energy expenditure to determine whether one metric can be used for all healthy children. Such a metric could improve our ability to further advance the Compendium of Physical Activities for Youth. Methods A secondary analysis of oxygen uptake (VO2) data obtained from five sites was completed, that included 947 children ages 5 to 18 years, who engaged in 14 different activities. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was computed based on Schofield Equations [Hum Nutr Clin Nut. 39(Suppl 1), 1985]. Absolute oxygen uptake (ml.min-1), oxygen uptake per kilogram body mass (VO2 in ml.kg-1.min-1), net oxygen uptake (VO2 – resting metabolic rate), allometric scaled oxygen uptake (VO2 in ml.kg-0.75.min-1) and YOUTH-MET (VO2.[resting VO2] -1) were calculated. These metrics were regressed with age, sex, height, and body mass. Results Net and allometric-scaled VO2, and YOUTH-MET were least associated with age, sex and physical characteristics. For moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities, allometric scaling was least related to age and sex. For sedentary and low-intensity activities, YOUTH-MET was least related to age and sex. Conclusions No energy expenditure metric completely eliminated the influence of age, physical characteristics, and sex. The Adult MET consistently overestimated EE. YOUTH-MET was better for expressing energy expenditure for sedentary and light activities, whereas allometric scaling was better for moderate and vigorous intensity activities. From a practical perspective, The YOUTH-MET may be the more feasible metric for improving of the Compendium of Physical Activities for Youth."

Individuals were categorized by the presence or absence of metabolic disease risk factors including visceral fat accumulation, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. A total of 23 GM3 molecular species were measured, of these, eight were found to be significantly elevated in individuals with visceral fat accumulation and metabolic disease, defined as the presence of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. All of the GM3 molecular species were composed of the sphingoid base sphingosine (d18:1 (Δ4)) and, interestingly, six of the eight elevated GM3 molecular species contained a hydroxylated ceramide moiety. The hydroxylated GM3 species were, in order of decreasing abundance, d18:1-h24:0 ≈ d18:1-h24:1 > d18:1-h22:0 » d18:1-h20:0 > d18:1-h21:0 > d18:1-h18:1. Univariate and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted using a number of clinical health variables associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic disease, atherosclerosis and hypertension. GM3(d18:1-h24:1) was identified as the best candidate for metabolic screening, proving to be significantly correlated with intima-media thickness, used for the detection of atherosclerotic disease in humans, and a number of metabolic disease risk factors including autotaxin, LDL-c and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)."
https://openalex.org/W804694437,"The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate contractile and non-contractile content of lower leg muscles of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and determine the relationships between non-contractile content and functional abilities.Lower leg muscles of thirty-two boys with DMD and sixteen age matched unaffected controls were imaged. Non-contractile content, contractile cross sectional area and non-contractile cross sectional area of lower leg muscles (tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, peroneal, medial gastrocnemius and soleus) were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Muscle strength, timed functional tests and the Brooke lower extremity score were also assessed.Non-contractile content of lower leg muscles (peroneal, medial gastrocnemius, and soleus) was significantly greater than control group (p<0.05). Non-contractile content of lower leg muscles correlated with Brooke score (rs = 0.64-0.84) and 30 feet walk (rs = 0.66-0.80). Dorsiflexor (DF) and plantarflexor (PF) specific torque was significantly different between the groups.Overall, non-contractile content of the lower leg muscles was greater in DMD than controls. Furthermore, there was an age dependent increase in contractile content in the medial gastrocnemius of boys with DMD. The findings of this study suggest that T1 weighted MR images can be used to monitor disease progression and provide a quantitative estimate of contractile and non-contractile content of tissue in children with DMD."
https://openalex.org/W809705759,"Genome-wide dissection of the heat stress response (HSR) is necessary to overcome problems in crop production caused by global warming. To identify HSR genes, we profiled gene expression in two Chinese cabbage inbred lines with different thermotolerances, Chiifu and Kenshin. Many genes exhibited >2-fold changes in expression upon exposure to 0.5- 4 h at 45°C (high temperature, HT): 5.2% (2,142 genes) in Chiifu and 3.7% (1,535 genes) in Kenshin. The most enriched GO (Gene Ontology) items included 'response to heat', 'response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)', 'response to temperature stimulus', 'response to abiotic stimulus', and 'MAPKKK cascade'. In both lines, the genes most highly induced by HT encoded small heat shock proteins (Hsps) and heat shock factor (Hsf)-like proteins such as HsfB2A (Bra029292), whereas high-molecular weight Hsps were constitutively expressed. Other upstream HSR components were also up-regulated: ROS-scavenging genes like glutathione peroxidase 2 (BrGPX2, Bra022853), protein kinases, and phosphatases. Among heat stress (HS) marker genes in Arabidopsis, only exportin 1A (XPO1A) (Bra008580, Bra006382) can be applied to B. rapa for basal thermotolerance (BT) and short-term acquired thermotolerance (SAT) gene. CYP707A3 (Bra025083, Bra021965), which is involved in the dehydration response in Arabidopsis, was associated with membrane leakage in both lines following HS. Although many transcription factors (TF) genes, including DREB2A (Bra005852), were involved in HS tolerance in both lines, Bra024224 (MYB41) and Bra021735 (a bZIP/AIR1 [Anthocyanin-Impaired-Response-1]) were specific to Kenshin. Several candidate TFs involved in thermotolerance were confirmed as HSR genes by real-time PCR, and these assignments were further supported by promoter analysis. Although some of our findings are similar to those obtained using other plant species, clear differences in Brassica rapa reveal a distinct HSR in this species. Our data could also provide a springboard for developing molecular markers of HS and for engineering HS tolerant B. rapa."
https://openalex.org/W1532337562,"The human immune response to influenza vaccination depends in part on preexisting cross-reactive (heterosubtypic) immunity from previous infection by, and/or vaccination with, influenza strains that share antigenic determinants with the vaccine strains. However, current methods for assessing heterosubtypic antibody responses against influenza, including the hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay and ELISA, are time and labor intensive, and require moderate amounts of serum and reagents. To address these issues we have developed a fluorescent multiplex assay, mPlex-Flu, that rapidly and simultaneously measures strain specific IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies against influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from multiple viral strains. We cloned, expressed and purified HA proteins from 12 influenza strains, and coupled them to multiplex beads. Assay validation showed that minimal sample volumes (<5 μl of serum) were needed, and the assay had a linear response over a four Log10 range. The assay detected nanogram levels of anti-influenza specific antibodies, had high accuracy and reproducibility, with an average percentage coefficient of variation (%CV) of 9.06 for intra-assay and 12.94 for inter-assay variability. Pre- and post-intramuscular trivalent influenza vaccination levels of virus specific Ig were consistent with HAI titer and ELISA measurements. A significant advantage of the mPLEX-Flu assay over the HAI assay is the ability to perform antigenic cartography, determining the antigenic distances between influenza HA’s, without mathematical correction for HAI data issues. For validation we performed antigenic cartography on 14 different post-influenza infection ferret sera assayed against 12 different influenza HA’s. Results were in good agreement with a phylogenetic tree generated from hierarchical clustering of the genomic HA sequences. This is the first report of the use of a multiplex method for antigenic cartography using ferret sera. Overall, the mPlex-Flu assay provides a powerful tool to rapidly assess the influenza antibody repertoire in large populations and to study heterosubtypic immunity induced by influenza vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W1495072173,"BNIP3 is a dual function protein, able to activate autophagy and induce cell death. Upon expression of BNIP3, which is upregulated by hypoxia, the protein induces mitochondrial dysfunction, often leading to cell death. However, some highly respiring cells and cancer cells tolerate BNIP3 expression, suggesting that a yet unknown mechanism exists to restrain the lethal effects of BNIP3 on mitochondria. Here we present evidence that BNIP3 undergoes several phosphorylation events at its C-terminus, adjacent to the transmembrane domain. Phosphorylation at these residues inhibits BNIP3-induced mitochondrial damage, preventing a loss of mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as preventing an increase in reactive oxygen species. This decrease in mitochondrial damage, as well as the reduction of cell death upon C-terminal BNIP3 phosphorylation, can be explained by a diminished interaction between BNIP3 and OPA1, a key regulator of mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial inner membrane structure. Importantly, phosphorylation of these C-terminal BNIP3 residues blocks cell death without preventing autophagy, providing evidence that the two functional roles of BNIP3 can be regulated independently. These findings establish phosphorylation as a switch to determine the pro-survival and pro-death effects of the protein. Our findings also suggest a novel target for the regulation of these activities in transformed cells where BNIP3 is often highly expressed."
https://openalex.org/W744885778,"Patient’s age at the time of diagnosis is an important prognostic factor for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) as reflected in various staging and risk stratification systems. However, discrepancies exist among the different staging systems on an optimal cut-off age for predicting the clinical outcome of patients with DTC. To determine the age at diagnosis most predictive of clinical outcomes of DTC, a population-based cohort study was performed composed of 35,323 patients with DTC between 1988 and 2010 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The Youden index J was used to determine the most predictive age-at-diagnosis for thyroid-cancer-specific death. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the hazard ratios (HRs) for each age group. With a median follow-up of 5.4 years (range, 0–22.9 years), DTC-associated mortality was 1.5% (n = 533) and the rate of death from overall cause was 7.0% (n = 2482). The optimal cutoff age at diagnosis for thyroid-cancer-specific death was 57. Multivariate analysis found that the age-at-diagnosis is the most prognostic factor for thyroid-cancer-specific death (HR 10.02, 95% CI 8.18–12.28). Age at diagnosis is the most important prognostic factor for DTC patients. Based on our analysis, age at diagnosis of 57 might be the optimal predictor of thyroid-cancer-specific death. This finding might be used as consideration in revision of the risk stratification system for treatment of DTC patients."

https://openalex.org/W797966153,"Many species of reef fishes form large spawning aggregations that are highly predictable in space and time. Prior research has suggested that aggregating fish derive fitness benefits not just from mating at high density but, also, from oceanographic features of the spatial locations where aggregations occur. Using a probabilistic biophysical model of larval dispersal coupled to a fine resolution hydrodynamic model of the Florida Straits, we develop a stochastic landscape of larval fitness. Tracking virtual larvae from release to settlement and incorporating changes in larval behavior through ontogeny, we found that larval success was sensitive to the timing of spawning. Indeed, propagules released during the observed spawning period had higher larval success rates than those released outside the observed spawning period. In contrast, larval success rates were relatively insensitive to the spatial position of the release site. In addition, minimum (rather than mean) larval survival was maximized during the observed spawning period, indicating a reproductive strategy that minimizes the probability of recruitment failure. Given this landscape of larval fitness, we take an inverse optimization approach to define a biological objective function that reflects a tradeoff between the mean and variance of larval success in a temporally variable environment. Using this objective function, we suggest that the length of the spawning period can provide insight into the tradeoff between reproductive risk and reward."
https://openalex.org/W1441221463,"Chronic exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), ubiquitous environmental contaminants, can adversely affect the development and function of the nervous system. Here we evaluated the effect of PCB exposure on mitochondrial function using the PCB mixture Aroclor-1254 (A1254) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. A 6-hour exposure to A1254 (5 μg/ml) reduced cellular ATP production by 45%±7, and mitochondrial membrane potential, detected by TMRE, by 49%±7. Consistently, A1254 significantly decreased oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis measured by extracellular flux analyzer. Furthermore, the activity of mitochondrial protein complexes I, II, and IV, but not V (ATPase), measured by BN-PAGE technique, was significantly reduced after 6-hour exposure to A1254. The addition of pyruvic acid during exposure to A1254 significantly prevent A1254-induced cell injury, restoring resting mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP levels, oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, pyruvic acid significantly preserved the activity of mitochondrial complexes I, II and IV and increased basal activity of complex V. Collectively, the present results indicate that the neurotoxicity of A1254 depends on the impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, aerobic glycolysis, and mitochondrial complexes I, II, and IV activity and it was counteracted by pyruvic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1642431173,"Posterior leaflet prolapse following chordal elongation or rupture is one of the primary valvular diseases in patients with degenerative mitral valves (MVs). Quadrangular resection followed by ring annuloplasty is a reliable and reproducible surgical repair technique for treatment of posterior leaflet prolapse. Virtual MV repair simulation of leaflet resection in association with patient-specific 3D echocardiographic data can provide quantitative biomechanical and physiologic characteristics of pre- and post-resection MV function. We have developed a solid personalized computational simulation protocol to perform virtual MV repair using standard clinical guidelines of posterior leaflet resection with annuloplasty ring implantation. A virtual MV model was created using 3D echocardiographic data of a patient with posterior chordal rupture and severe mitral regurgitation. A quadrangle-shaped leaflet portion in the prolapsed posterior leaflet was removed, and virtual plication and suturing were performed. An annuloplasty ring of proper size was reconstructed and virtual ring annuloplasty was performed by superimposing the ring and the mitral annulus. Following the quadrangular resection and ring annuloplasty simulations, patient-specific annular motion and physiologic transvalvular pressure gradient were implemented and dynamic finite element simulation of MV function was performed. The pre-resection MV demonstrated a substantial lack of leaflet coaptation which directly correlated with the severe mitral regurgitation. Excessive stress concentration was found along the free marginal edge of the posterior leaflet involving the chordal rupture. Following the virtual resection and ring annuloplasty, the severity of the posterior leaflet prolapse markedly decreased. Excessive stress concentration disappeared over both anterior and posterior leaflets, and complete leaflet coaptation was effectively restored. This novel personalized virtual MV repair strategy has great potential to help with preoperative selection of the patient-specific optimal MV repair techniques, allow innovative surgical planning to expect improved efficacy of MV repair with more predictable outcomes, and ultimately provide more effective medical care for the patient."
https://openalex.org/W2281167198,"L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) regulate many physiological functions like muscle contraction, hormone secretion, gene expression, and neuronal excitability. Their activity is strictly controlled by various molecular mechanisms. The pore-forming α1-subunit comprises four repeated domains (I–IV), each connected via an intracellular linker. Here we identified a polybasic plasma membrane binding motif, consisting of four arginines, within the I-II linker of all LTCCs. The primary structure of this motif is similar to polybasic clusters known to interact with polyphosphoinositides identified in other ion channels. We used de novo molecular modeling to predict the conformation of this polybasic motif, immunofluorescence microscopy and live cell imaging to investigate the interaction with the plasma membrane, and electrophysiology to study its role for Cav1.2 channel function. According to our models, this polybasic motif of the I-II linker forms a straight α-helix, with the positive charges facing the lipid phosphates of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Membrane binding of the I-II linker could be reversed after phospholipase C activation, causing polyphosphoinositide breakdown, and was accelerated by elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels. This indicates the involvement of negatively charged phospholipids in the plasma membrane targeting of the linker. Neutralization of four arginine residues eliminated plasma membrane binding. Patch clamp recordings revealed facilitated opening of Cav1.2 channels containing these mutations, weaker inhibition by phospholipase C activation, and reduced expression of channels (as quantified by ON-gating charge) at the plasma membrane.

LTCCs are large multiprotein complexes consisting of a pore-forming transmembrane α1-subunit and accessory intracellular β- and extracellular α2δ-subunits. To adapt Ca2+ entry to different cellular needs, functional diversity is achieved by multiple molecular mechanisms. Four different α1-subunits (CaV1.1–1.4) can confer different biophysical properties (1Catterall W.A. Voltage-gated calcium channels.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

In addition, the channels' accessory subunits tune their gating behavior and various protein interaction partners further provide LTCC currents with cell- and tissue-specific properties (1Catterall W.A. Voltage-gated calcium channels.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3a003947Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). However, rapid regulatory changes in current dynamics cannot be accomplished by changing channel composition. Instead, quick adaptive responses of channel activity require fast regulatory processes, including Ca2+ entry itself (inducing inactivation through channel-bound calmodulin (6Peterson B.Z.

Next to these mechanisms, membrane lipids are also important regulators of Ca2+ channel activity (12Roberts-Crowley M.L. Mitra-Ganguli T. Liu L. Rittenhouse A.R.

Depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) from the plasma membrane causes a rapid decrease of Ca2+ channel activity. In excised membrane patches, non-LTCC currents (CaV2.1 and CaV2.2) run down within minutes, which is attenuated by application of PIP2 or its water-soluble analogue diC8-PIP2 (14Wu L. Bauer C.S.

Rapid depletion of membrane PIP2 content in intact cells by muscarinic 1 (M1) receptor activation, voltage-dependent phosphatases, or rapamycin-induced translocation of inositol-lipid phosphatases confirmed the direct dependence of CaV1 (CaV1.2 and CaV1.3) and CaV2 (CaV2.1 and CaV2.2) channels on endogenous membrane PIP2 (16Suh B.C.

Channel inhibition by PIP2 depletion occurs in a β-subunit-dependent manner because the β2a-subunit, an isoform anchored to the plasma membrane by palmitoylation, attenuates inhibition (13Suh B.C. Hille B. PIP2 is a necessary cofactor for ion channel function: how and why?.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 17Suh B.C. Kim D.I. Falkenburger B.H.

Together with observations that arachidonic acid inhibits channel activity, a model has been proposed in which PIP2, the fatty acid side chain of palmitoylated β2a-subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs), and arachidonic acid have overlapping binding sites, resulting in complex channel regulation by lipid metabolism (12Roberts-Crowley M.L.

There is also experimental evidence for more than one PIP2 regulatory site in VGCCs: a higher affinity stimulatory “S” site supporting channel activity and a lower affinity inhibitory site (“R” site) stabilizing reluctant gating properties (12Roberts-Crowley M.L.

Despite unique insights into the structural basis of PIP2 modulation within the crystal structure of K+ channels (23Hansen S.B. Tao X. MacKinnon R.

Vivas O. Suh B.C. Phosphoinositides regulate ion channels.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1851: 844-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the structural basis for fast modulation of VGCC function by plasma membrane lipids is unknown. It occurs at a very fast time scale, indicating that channel-lipid interactions are rapidly reversible and do not require more complex biochemical pathways, such as channel internalization (26Altier C. Garcia-Caballero A. Simms B. You H. Chen L. Walcher J. Tedford H.W. Hermosilla T. Zamponi G.W. The Cavβ subunit prevents RFP2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of L-type channels.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Similar to K+ channels (23Hansen S.B. Tao X. MacKinnon R.

Crystal structure of the mammalian GIRK2 K+ channel and gating regulation by G proteins, PIP2, and sodium.Cell. 2011; 147: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), it appears likely that cytoplasmic domains located close to the plasma membrane participate in lipid interactions that stabilize channel function and allow modulation of channels by activation of phospholipase C (PLC). In addition to fast channel modulation, it is at present also unknown whether anionic lipids participate in the constitutive stabilization of VGCC function, which would be expected for very high affinity interactions not subject to regulation by changes in plasmalemmal phospholipid content (27Hilgemann D.W. Fitting K(V) potassium channels into the PIP(2) puzzle: Hille group connects dots between illustrious HH groups.J. Gen Physiol. 2012; 140: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a polybasic cluster within the cytoplasmic I-II linker of CaV1.2 α1-subunits, which specifically binds to the plasma membrane. Activation of PLCs and polyphosphoinositide breakdown together with elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels reverse membrane binding. Four positively charged arginines are required for binding, most likely by strongly favoring a straight helix conformation of that region, positioning it entirely at the interface between the hydrocarbon core and lipid headgroups. Their neutralization in the intact channel facilitates channel opening and thus suggests a role of this polybasic cluster in stabilizing normal channel activity. All chemicals, reagents and antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Vienna, Austria) except where otherwise indicated. diC8-PIP2 was purchased from Echelon Biosciences Inc.

For whole-cell patch clamp recordings, tsA-201 cells were transiently transfected with equimolar ratios of cDNA encoding C-terminally long or short wild-type or mutant CaV1.2 α1-subunits together with auxiliary β3- (rat, NM_012828) and α2δ1- (rabbit, NM_001082276) subunits. To visualize transfected cells, GFP was co-transfected. Cells were then plated onto a 35-mm culture dish coated with poly-l-lysine. The cells were kept at 30 °C and 5% CO2 and subjected to electrophysiological measurements about 48–72 h after transfection. 48 h after plating, tsA-201 cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15710) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 5% (w/v) normal goat serum (GibcoBRL, 16210-064) in 0.2% (v/v) Triton/phosphate-buffered saline for cell permeabilization. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in washing buffer containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.2% (w/v) BSA (immunoglobulin-free) in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing the cells in washing buffer, they were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Washing was repeated, and the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, H-1000) and sealed with nail polish on microscope slides. The following antibodies were employed: mouse monoclonal anti-V5, working dilution 1:500 (Invitrogen, R96025); rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma, F7425; 1:500); mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma, F3165; 1:5000); Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:4000; Life Technologies, Invitrogen, A-11008 and A-11005). Images were captured with an Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., ×63, 1.4 numerical aperture Zeiss plan apochromat oil immersion lens) using a cooled CCD camera and at room temperature and Meta View image processing software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Images were manually adjusted for brightness and contrast with Adobe Photoshop version 7.0. After 24 h of replating, 18-mm coverslips containing live tsA-201 cells were washed once with Tyrode solution (130 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 30 mm glucose, pH 7.4, 319 mosmol/liter), subsequently mounted on a Ludin chamber (Life Imaging Services) and kept in Tyrode solution until further processing. The chamber was placed on an ASI stage of an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cells were imaged at room temperature. Different drugs (10 μm oxotremorine M, 50 μm m-3M3FBS (2,4,6-trimethyl-N-(meta-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-benzenesulfonamide), 5 μm ionomycin, 20 μm wortmannin, 5 μm rapamycin (Calbiochem, Merck Millipore)) in different combinations (as indicated under “Results”) were diluted to final concentrations in Tyrode solution and either directly added to the imaging chamber or added to a 35-mm culture dish containing the coverslip when preincubation was desired. Twelve-bit grayscale images were recorded at different time intervals using a cooled CCD camera (SPOT, Diagnostic Instruments), Metavue image processing software (Universal Imaging, Corp.), and a ×63, 1.4 numerical aperture Zeiss Plan Apochromat oil immersion lens. For presentation, selected images were linearly adjusted using Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 and CS4. For quantification, areas of interest of equal size were selected in the membrane, cytoplasm, and background of cells, and average pixel intensity was recorded and used to calculate the membrane to cytoplasm ratio for every image. All quantitative data are represented as mean ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments (n), except if stated otherwise. Data were analyzed by paired Student's t test, unpaired Student's t test, or one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-hoc test using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Significance level was set to p < 0.05. Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed in transiently transfected tsA-201 cells using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Electrodes with a final resistance of 2–4 megaohms were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments) and subsequently fire-polished (MF-830 microforge, Narishinge). Ca2+ currents were measured using the following solutions: pipette solution, 135 mm CsCl, 10 mm Cs-EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm Na2-ATP, adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH; bath solution, 15 mm CaCl2, 150 mm choline chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH. All voltages were corrected for a junction potential of −9.3 mV. Recordings were digitized (Digidata 1322A digitizer, Axon Instruments) at 50 kHz, low pass-filtered at 5 kHz, and analyzed using pClamp version 10.2 software (Axon instruments). Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were obtained by applying a 20-ms square pulse protocol to various test potentials starting from a holding potential of −90 mV. Resulting I-V curves were fitted to Equation 1, I=Gmax(V−Vrev)/(1+exp(−(V−V0.5)/kact))Eq. 1 where I is the peak current amplitude, Gmax is the maximum slope conductance, V is the test potential, Vrev is the extrapolated reversal potential, V0.5 is the half-maximal activation voltage, and kact is the activation slope. Channel inactivation was measured using a 300-ms pulse from a holding potential of −90 mV to Vmax. For the estimation of the open probability (PO), the area of the ON-gating current (QON) was integrated and compared with the amplitude of the ionic tail current (ITail) at Vrev. Data were analyzed using Clampfit version 10.2 (Axon Instruments) and Sigma Plot 12 (Systat Software Inc.). To assess the effects of diC8-PIP2 or the PLC activator m-3M3FBS, cells were depolarized from a holding potential of −90 mV to Vmax for 20 ms at 0.1 Hz. As a control, CaV1.2S- or CaV1.2S4E-expressing cells were perfused (flow rate: 250 μl/min) with bath solution only. To test whether diC8-PIP2 can stabilize ICa decline, the same protocol was performed in the presence of 100 μm diC8-PIP2 in the internal solution. DiC8-PIP2 was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions as a 1 mm stock in intracellular recording solution. Aliquots were kept frozen and diluted before"
https://openalex.org/W2134343852,"Jesridonin, a small molecule obtained through the structural modification of Oridonin, has extensive antitumor activity. In this study, we evaluated both its in vitro activity in the cancer cell line EC109 and its in vivo effect on tumor xenografts in nude mice. Apoptosis induced by Jesridonin was determined using an MTT assay, Annexin-V FITC assay and Hoechest 33258 staining. Apoptosis via mitochondrial and death receptor pathways were confirmed by detecting the regulation of MDM2, p53, and Bcl-2 family members and by activation of caspase-3/-8/-9. In addition, vena caudalis injection of Jesridonin showed significant inhibition of tumor growth in the xenograft model, and Jesridonin-induced cell apoptosis in tumor tissues was determined using TUNEL. Biochemical serum analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total protein (TP) and albumin (ALB) indicated no obvious effects on liver function. Histopathological examination of the liver, kidney, lung, heart and spleen revealed no signs of JD-induced toxicity. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Jesridonin exhibits antitumor activity in human esophageal carcinomas EC109 cells both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated no adverse effects on major organs in nude mice. These studies provide support for new drug development."
https://openalex.org/W840264840,"The persistence of Shiga-like toxin producing E. coli (STEC) strains in the agricultural soil creates serious threat to human health through fresh vegetables growing on them. However, the survival of STEC strains in Indian tropical soils is not yet understood thoroughly. Additionally how the survival of STEC strain in soil diverges with non-pathogenic and genetically modified E. coli strains is also not yet assessed. Hence in the present study, the survival pattern of STEC strain (O157-TNAU) was compared with non-pathogenic (MTCC433) and genetically modified (DH5α) strains on different tropical agricultural soils and on a vegetable growing medium, cocopeat under controlled condition. The survival pattern clearly discriminated DH5α from MTCC433 and O157-TNAU, which had shorter life (40 days) than those compared (60 days). Similarly, among the soils assessed, the red laterite and tropical latosol supported longer survival of O157-TNAU and MTCC433 as compared to wetland and black cotton soils. In cocopeat, O157 recorded significantly longer survival than other two strains. The survival data were successfully analyzed using Double-Weibull model and the modeling parameters were correlated with soil physico-chemical and biological properties using principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA of all the three strains revealed that pH, microbial biomass carbon, dehydrogenase activity and available N and P contents of the soil decided the survival of E. coli strains in those soils and cocopeat. The present research work suggests that the survival of O157 differs in tropical Indian soils due to varied physico-chemical and biological properties and the survival is much shorter than those reported in temperate soils. As the survival pattern of non-pathogenic strain, MTCC433 is similar to O157-TNAU in tropical soils, the former can be used as safe model organism for open field studies."
https://openalex.org/W1845875257,"Individuals carrying rare, but biologically informative genetic variants provide a unique opportunity to model major mental illness and inform understanding of disease mechanisms. The rarity of such variations means that their study involves small group numbers, however they are amongst the strongest known genetic risk factors for major mental illness and are likely to have large neural effects. DISC1 (Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1) is a gene containing one such risk variant, identified in a single Scottish family through its disruption by a balanced translocation of chromosomes 1 and 11; t(1;11) (q42.1;q14.3).Within the original pedigree, we examined the effects of the t(1;11) translocation on white matter integrity, measured by fractional anisotropy (FA). This included family members with (n = 7) and without (n = 13) the translocation, along with a clinical control sample of patients with psychosis (n = 34), and a group of healthy controls (n = 33).We report decreased white matter integrity in five clusters in the genu of the corpus callosum, the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, acoustic radiation and fornix. Analysis of the mixed psychosis group also demonstrated decreased white matter integrity in the above regions. FA values within the corpus callosum correlated significantly with positive psychotic symptom severity.We demonstrate that the t(1;11) translocation is associated with reduced white matter integrity in frontal commissural and association fibre tracts. These findings overlap with those shown in affected patients with psychosis and in DISC1 animal models and highlight the value of rare but biologically informative mutations in modeling psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W1929777163,"The human cathelicidin LL-37 is a multifunctional host defense peptide with immunomodulatory and antimicrobial roles. It kills bacteria primarily by altering membrane barrier properties, although the exact sequence of events leading to cell lysis has not yet been completely elucidated. Random insertion mutagenesis allowed isolation of Escherichia coli mutants with altered susceptibility to LL-37, pointing to factors potentially relevant to its activity. Among these, inactivation of the waaY gene, encoding a kinase responsible for heptose II phosphorylation in the LPS inner core, leads to a phenotype with decreased susceptibility to LL-37, stemming from a reduced amount of peptide binding to the surface of the cells, and a diminished capacity to lyse membranes. This points to a specific role of the LPS inner core in guiding LL-37 to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria. Although electrostatic interactions are clearly relevant, the susceptibility of the waaY mutant to other cationic helical cathelicidins was unaffected, indicating that particular structural features or LL-37 play a role in this interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2892176673,"To determine the prevalence and clinicopathological characteristics of BRAF V600E mutation and HER2 exon 20 insertions in Chinese lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients.Given the fact that the driver mutations are mutually exclusive in lung ADCs, 204 EGFR/KRAS wild-type cases were enrolled in this study. Direct Sanger sequencing was performed to examine BRAF V600E and HER2 exon 20 mutations. The association of BRAF and HER2 mutations with clinicopathological characteristics was statistically analyzed.Among the 204 lung ADCs tested, 11 cases (5.4%) carried HER2 exon 20 insertions and 4 cases (2.0%) had BRAF V600E mutation. HER2 mutation status was identified to be associated with a non-smoking history (p<0.05). HER2 mutation occurs in 9.4% of never smokers (10/106), 8.7% of female (8/92) and 2.7% of male (3/112) in this selected cohort. All four BRAF mutated patients were women and three of them were never-smokers. No HER2 mutant patients harbor BRAF mutation.HER2 and BRAF mutations identify a distinct subset of lung ADCs. Given the high prevalence of lung cancer and the availability of targeted therapy, Chinese lung ADC patients without EGFR and KRAS mutations are recommended for HER2 and BRAF mutations detection, especially for those never smokers."
https://openalex.org/W2291204103,"Local access networks (LAN) are commonly used as communication infrastructures which meet the demand of a set of users in the local environment. Usually these networks consist of several LAN segments connected by bridges. The topological LAN design bi-level problem consists on assigning users to clusters and the union of clusters by bridges in order to obtain a minimum response time network with minimum connection cost. Therefore, the decision of optimally assigning users to clusters will be made by the leader and the follower will make the decision of connecting all the clusters while forming a spanning tree. In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm for solving the bi-level topological design of a Local Access Network. Our solution method considers the Stackelberg equilibrium to solve the bi-level problem. The Stackelberg-Genetic algorithm procedure deals with the fact that the follower's problem cannot be optimally solved in a straightforward manner. The computational results obtained from two different sets of instances show that the performance of the developed algorithm is efficient and that it is more suitable for solving the bi-level problem than a previous Nash-Genetic approach."
https://openalex.org/W1607646839,"The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a successful colonizer of the stomach. H. pylori infection strongly correlates with the development and progression of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric malignances. Vaccination is a promising strategy for preventing H. pylori infection. In this study, we evaluated the candidate antigens heat shock protein A (HspA) and H. pylori γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) for their effectiveness in development of subunit vaccines against H. pylori infection. rHspA, rGGT, and rHspA-GGT, a fusion protein based on HspA and GGT, were constructed and separately expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Mice were then immunized intranasally with these proteins, with or without adjuvant. Immunized mice exhibited reduced bacterial colonization in stomach. The highest reduction in bacterial colonization was seen in mice immunized with the fusion protein rHspA-GGT when paired with the mucosal adjuvant LTB. Protection against H. pylori colonization was mediated by a strong systemic and localized humoral immune response, as well as a balanced Th1/Th2 cytokine response. In addition, immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that rHspA-GGT specific rabbit antibodies were able to directly bind H. pylori in vitro. These results suggest antibodies are essential to the protective immunity associated with rHspA-GGT immunization. In summary, our results suggest HspA and GGT are promising vaccine candidates for protection against H. pylori infection."
https://openalex.org/W780624270,"NF-κB is an important regulator of both differentiation and function of lineage-committed hematopoietic cells. Targeted deletion of IκB kinase (IKK) β results in altered cytokine signaling and marked neutrophilia. To investigate the role of IKKβ in regulation of hematopoiesis, we employed Mx1-Cre mediated IKKβ conditional knockout mice. As previously reported, deletion of IKKβ in hematopoietic cells results in neutrophilia, and we now also noted decreased monocytes and modest anemia. Granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) accumulated markedly in bone marrow of IKKβ deleted mice whereas the proportion and number of megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEP) decreased. Accordingly, we found a significantly reduced frequency of proerythroblasts and basophilic and polychromatic erythroblasts, and IKKβ-deficient bone marrow cells yielded a significantly decreased number of BFU-E compared to wild type. These changes are associated with elevated expression of C/EBPα, Gfi1, and PU.1 and diminished Gata1, Klf1, and SCL/Tal1 in IKKβ deficient Lineage-Sca1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells. In contrast, no effect on erythropoiesis or expression of lineage-related transcription factors was found in marrow lacking NF-κB p65. Bone marrow from IKKβ knockout mice has elevated numbers of phenotypic long and short term hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). A similar increase was observed when IKKβ was deleted after marrow transplantation into a wild type host, indicating cell autonomous expansion. Myeloid progenitors from IKKβ- but not p65-deleted mice demonstrate increased serial replating in colony-forming assays, indicating increased cell autonomous self-renewal capacity. In addition, in a competitive repopulation assay deletion of IKKβ resulted in a stable advantage of bone marrow derived from IKKβ knockout mice. In summary, loss of IKKβ resulted in significant effects on hematopoiesis not seen upon NF-κB p65 deletion. These include increased myeloid and reduced erythroid transcription factors, skewing differentiation towards myeloid over erythroid differentiation, increased progenitor self-renewal, and increased number of functional long term HSCs. These data inform ongoing efforts to develop IKK inhibitors for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W840079847,"Objective An Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis is preceded by a long period of cognitive decline. We previously demonstrated increased risk of decline among individuals possessing one or more APOE ε4 alleles together with a family history of AD. The objective of this study is to investigate the possibility that such an increased risk might be due to AD risk genes with small effects in combination with APOE. Methods Participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) over the age of 65, who contributed DNA, and had two or more evaluations with an abbreviated version of the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m) were eligible for the study (n = 7451). A genetic risk score (g-score) was derived using AD risk genes’ meta-analyses data, assigning risk according to the number of risk alleles and summed over all the risk genes. Trajectories of cognitive function were modeled in four groups of Caucasian participants with and without one or more APOE ε4 alleles and either a high or low g-score: APOE ε4-/low g-score; APOE ε4-/high g-score; APOE ε4+/low g-score; and APOE ε4+/high g-score. Post hoc analyses evaluated interactions between individual genes and APOE. Results Individuals in the APOE ε4+/high g-score group exhibited the greatest cognitive decline over time (p<.0001). This risk appeared to be greater than the sum of the effects of either high g-score or APOE ε4 alone. When gene interactions were individually tested with APOE, a statistically significant interaction with CD33 was discovered (p = 0.04) although the interaction was no longer significant when adjusted for multiple comparisons. Conclusions Individuals with multiple AD risk genes in addition to having one or more APOE ε4 alleles are at greater risk of cognitive decline than individuals with either APOE ε4 or a high genetic risk score. Among those with one or more APOE ε4 alleles, having one or more copies of the CD33 C (risk) allele may further increase the risk of cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W2298372181,"Specificity protein (Sp) 1 mediates the transcription of a large number of constitutive genes encoding physiological mediators. NF-κB mediates the expression of hundreds of inducible genes encoding pathological mediators. Crosstalk between Sp1 and NF-κB pathways could be pathophysiologically significant, but has not been studied. This study examined the crosstalk between the two pathways and defined the role of NF-κB signaling in LPS-induced down-regulation of Sp1 activity.Challenge of wild type mice with samonelia enteritidis LPS (10 mg/kg, i.p.) down-regulated Sp1 binding activity in lungs in a time-dependent manner, which was concomitantly associated with an increased NF-κB activity. LPS down-regulates Sp1 activity by inducing an LPS inducible Sp1-degrading enzyme (LISPDE) activity, which selectively degrades Sp1 protein, resulting in Sp1 down-regulation. Blockade of NF-κB activation in mice deficient in NF-κB p50 gene (NF-κB-KO) suppressed LISPDE activity, prevented Sp1 protein degradation, and reversed the down-regulation of Sp1 DNA binding activity and eNOS expression (an indicator of Sp1 transactivation activity). Inhibition of LISPDE activity using a selective LISPDE inhibitor mimicked the effects of NF-κB blockade. Pretreatment of LPS-challenged WT mice with a selective LISPDE inhibitor increased nuclear Sp1 protein content, restored Sp1 DNA binding activity and reversed eNOS protein down-regulation in lungs. Enhancing tissue level of Sp1 activity by inhibiting NF-κB-mediated Sp1 down-regulation increased tissue level of IL-10 and decreased tissue level of TNF- αin the lungs.NF-κB signaling mediates LPS-induced down-regulation of Sp1 activity. Activation of NF-κB pathway suppresses Sp1 activity and Sp1-mediated anti-inflammatory signals. Conversely, Sp1 signaling counter-regulates NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response. Crosstalk between NF-κB and Sp1 pathways regulates the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2253312316,"We investigated the impact of drought and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on the morphological structure and physiological function of shoots and roots of male and female seedlings of the dioecious plant Populus cathayana Rehder. Pot-grown seedlings were subjected to well watered or water-limiting conditions (drought) and were grown in soil that was either inoculated or not inoculated with the AM fungus Rhizophagus intraradices. No significant differences were found in the infection rates between the two sexes. Drought decreased root and shoot growth, biomass and root morphological characteristics, whereas superoxide radical (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide content, peroxidase (POD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and proline content were significantly enhanced in both sexes. Male plants that formed an AM fungal symbiosis showed a significant increase in shoot and root morphological growth, increased proline content of leaves and roots, and increased POD activity in roots under both watering regimes; however, MDA concentration in the roots decreased. By contrast, AM fungi either had no effect or a slight negative effect on the shoot and root growth of female plants, with lower root biomass, total biomass and root/shoot ration under drought. In females, MDA concentration increased in leaves and roots under both watering regimes, and the proline content and POD activity of roots increased under drought conditions; however, POD activity significantly decreased under well-watered conditions. These findings suggest that AM fungi enhanced the tolerance of male plants to drought by improving shoot and root growth, biomass and the antioxidant system. Further investigation is needed to unravel the complex effects of AM fungi on the growth and antioxidant system of female plants."
https://openalex.org/W2337065797,"Elongation factor 1A-1 (eEF1A-1) has non-canonical functions in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and apoptosis. It was previously identified through a promoter-trap screen as a mediator of fatty acid-induced cell death (lipotoxicity), and was found to participate in this process downstream of ER stress. Since ER stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), we investigated the mechanism of action of eEF1A-1 in hepatocyte lipotoxicity. HepG2 cells were exposed to excess fatty acids, followed by assessments of ER stress, subcellular localization of eEF1A-1, and cell death. A specific inhibitor of eEF1A-1 elongation activity, didemnin B, was used to determine whether its function in protein synthesis is involved in lipotoxicity. Within 6 h, eEF1A-1 protein was modestly induced by high palmitate, and partially re-localized from its predominant location at the ER to polymerized actin at the cell periphery. This early induction and subcellular redistribution of eEF1A-1 coincided with the onset of ER stress, and was later followed by cell death. Didemnin B did not prevent the initiation of ER stress by high palmitate, as indicated by eIF2α phosphorylation. However, consistent with sustained inhibition of eEF1A-1-dependent elongation activity, didemnin B prevented the recovery of protein synthesis and increase in GRP78 protein that are normally associated with later phases of the response to ongoing ER stress. This resulted in decreased palmitate-induced cell death. Our data implicate eEF1A-1, and its function in protein synthesis, in hepatocyte lipotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1829456249,"Retirement has been suggested to reduce medication adherence, but no evidence is available for statins. We investigated changes in adherence to statins among Swedish adults after retirement.A prospective cohort study was carried out on all individuals living in Sweden on 31 December 2004, alive in 2010, having purchased statins in the second half of 2005, and retired in 2008 (n=11 718). We used prescription dispensing data in 2006-2010 to determine nonadherence (defined as <80% of days covered by filled prescriptions) before and after old-age or disability retirement. Using multiple repeat measurements of filled statin prescriptions, we calculated the annual prevalence rates of nonadherence for those who continued therapy. Discontinuation was defined as no statin dispensations during a calendar year.After adjustment for age at retirement, the prevalence ratio (PR) of nonadherence after retirement in comparison with those before retirement was 1.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.29] for the men and 1.19 (95% CI 1.13-1.26) for the women. A post-retirement increase in nonadherence was consistently observed across the strata of age at retirement, marital status, education, income, type of retirement, and participants with and without cardiovascular disease, the largest increases being observed for statin use in secondary prevention (men: PR 1.38, 95% CI 1.26-1.54; women: PR 1.43, 1.18-1.72). For primary prevention, the corresponding prevalence ratios were 1.18 (95% CI 1.13‒1.25) and 1.18 (95% CI 1.11-1.24), respectively.Retirement appears to be associated with increased nonadherence to statin therapy among Swedish men and women."
https://openalex.org/W835113611,"The objective of this study was to explore predictors, including social factors, lifestyle factors, and factors relevant to glycemic control and treatment, for mild and severe hypoglycemia in insulin-treated Japanese diabetic patients. This study included 123 insulin-treated diabetic patients who were referred to the diabetes clinic between January and July 2013 at Shiga University of Medical Science Hospital. After a survey examining the various factors, patients were followed for 6 months. During the follow-up period, blood glucose was self-monitored. Mild hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose level 50-69 mg/dl, and severe hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose level ≤49 mg/dl. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of each factor for mild and severe hypoglycemia. During the 6-month follow-up period, 41 (33.3%) patients experienced mild hypoglycemia, and 20 (16.3%) experienced severe hypoglycemia. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, assistance from family members at the time of the insulin injection [presence/absence, OR (95% CI): 0.39 (0.16-0.97)] and drinking [current drinker/non- and ex-drinker, OR (95% CI): 4.89 (1.68-14.25)] affected mild hypoglycemia. Assistance from family members at the time of insulin injection [presence/absence, OR (95% CI): 0.19 (0.05-0.75)] and intensive insulin therapy [yes/no, OR (95% CI): 3.61 (1.06-12.26)] affected severe hypoglycemia. In conclusion, our findings suggest that not only a factor relevant to glycemic control and treatment (intensive insulin therapy) but also a social factor (assistance from family members) and a lifestyle factor (current drinking) were predictors for mild or severe hypoglycemia in Japanese insulin-treated diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W1535615471,"The scale and nature of cooperative efforts spanning geopolitical borders in clinical research have not been elucidated to date. In a cross-sectional study of 110,428 interventional trials registered in Clinicaltrials.gov, we characterized the evolution, trial demographics, and network properties of multinational clinical research. We reveal that the relative growth of international collaboratives has remained stagnant in the last two decades, although clinical trials have evolved to become much larger in scale. Multinational clinical trials are also characterized by higher patient enrollments, industry funding, and specific clinical disciplines including oncology and infectious disease. Network analyses demonstrate temporal shifts in collaboration patterns between countries and world regions, with developing nations now collaborating more within themselves, although Europe remains the dominant contributor to multinational clinical trials worldwide. Performances in network centrality measures also highlight the differential contribution of nations in the global research network. A city-level clinical trial network analysis further demonstrates how collaborative ties decline with physical distance. This study clarifies evolving themes and highlights potential growth mechanisms and barriers in multinational clinical trials, which may be useful in evaluating the role of national and local policies in organizing transborder efforts in clinical endeavors."
https://openalex.org/W773227475,"Members of the genera Prevotella, Veillonella and Fusobacterium are the predominant culturable obligate anaerobic bacteria isolated from periodontal abscesses. When determining the cumulative number of clinical anaerobic isolates from periodontal abscesses, ambiguous or overlapping signals were frequently encountered in 16S rRNA gene sequencing chromatograms, resulting in ambiguous identifications. With the exception of the genus Veillonella, the high intra-chromosomal heterogeneity of rrs genes has not been reported.The 16S rRNA genes of 138 clinical, strictly anaerobic isolates and one reference strain were directly sequenced, and the chromatograms were carefully examined. Gene cloning was performed for 22 typical isolates with doublet sequencing signals for the 16S rRNA genes, and four copies of the rrs-ITS genes of 9 Prevotella intermedia isolates were separately amplified by PCR, sequenced and compared. Five conserved housekeeping genes, hsp60, recA, dnaJ, gyrB1 and rpoB from 89 clinical isolates of Prevotella were also amplified by PCR and sequenced for identification and phylogenetic analysis along with 18 Prevotella reference strains.Heterogeneity of 16S rRNA genes was apparent in clinical, strictly anaerobic oral bacteria, particularly in the genera Prevotella and Veillonella. One hundred out of 138 anaerobic strains (72%) had intragenomic nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in multiple locations, and 13 strains (9.4%) had intragenomic insertions or deletions in the 16S rRNA gene. In the genera Prevotella and Veillonella, 75% (67/89) and 100% (19/19) of the strains had SNPs in the 16S rRNA gene, respectively. Gene cloning and separate amplifications of four copies of the rrs-ITS genes confirmed that 2 to 4 heterogeneous 16S rRNA copies existed.Sequence alignment of five housekeeping genes revealed that intra-species nucleotide similarities were very high in the genera Prevotella, ranging from 94.3-100%. However, the inter-species similarities were relatively low, ranging from 68.7-97.9%. The housekeeping genes rpoB and gyrB1 were demonstrated to be alternative classification markers to the species level based on intra- and inter-species comparisons, whereas based on phylogenetic tree rpoB proved to be reliable phylogenetic marker for the genus Prevotella."
https://openalex.org/W2271119201,"An alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with an increased susceptibility to respiratory infection and injury and, upon hospitalization, higher mortality rates. Studies in model systems show effects of alcohol on mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism and antioxidant systems. The present study applied high-resolution metabolomics to test for these changes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of subjects with an AUD. Smokers were excluded to avoid confounding effects and compliance was verified by cotinine measurements. Statistically significant metabolic features, differentially expressed by control and AUD subjects, were identified by statistical and bioinformatic methods. The results show that fatty acid and acylcarnitine concentrations were increased in AUD subjects, consistent with perturbed mitochondrial and lipid metabolism. Decreased concentrations of methyl-donor compounds suggest altered one-carbon metabolism and oxidative stress. An accumulation of peptides suggests proteolytic activity, which could reflect altered epithelial barrier function. Two metabolites of possible microbial origin suggest subclinical bacterial infection. Furthermore, increased diacetylspermine suggests additional metabolic perturbations, which could contribute to dysregulated alveolar macrophage function and vulnerability to infection. Together, the results show an extended metabolic consequence of AUD in the bronchoalveolar space."
https://openalex.org/W2336328692,"We induced mutants, stripe1-2 (st1-2) and stripe1-3 (st1-3), from rice (Oryza sativa L.) Indica 9311 using Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). Both st1-2 and st1-3 mutants encoded the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase 1 (RNRS1), differed in the location of the mutated base, and displayed white-stripe from the L2 stage through maturity. The mutants were sensitive to temperature, and their chlorophyll content increased with the increase in temperature; however, they did not revert to normal green leaf phenotype under field conditions. The mutant st1-2 showed loosely arranged thylakoid lamellar structure as compared with wild-type (WT) plants. Contrastingly, st1-3 displayed normal thylakoid lamellar structure, good agronomic traits, and higher yield than st1-2 but lower yield than WT. Three-dimensional structure prediction for RNRS1 indicated that the mutation in Val-171 residue in st1-2 influenced the connection of RNRS1 to iron, causing abnormal development of chloroplasts. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels associated with chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway and photosynthesis were affected in st1-2 and st1-3 at different temperatures and different developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W2120287121,"Vegetation patterns are strongly influenced by sand mobility in desert ecosystems. However, little is known about the spatial patterns of Artemisia ordosica, a dominant shrub in the Mu Us desert of Northwest China, in relation to sand fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate and contrast the effects of sand dune stabilization on the population and spatial distribution of this desert shrub. Spatial autocorrelation, semi-variance analysis, and point-pattern analysis were used jointly in this study to investigate the spatial patterns of A. ordosica populations on dunes in Yanchi County of Ningxia, China. The results showed that the spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity declined gradually, and the distance between the clustered individuals shortened following sand dune fixation. Seedlings were more aggregated than adults in all stage of dune stabilization, and both were more aggregated on shifting sand dunes separately. Spatial associations of the seedlings with the adults were mostly positive at distances of 0-5 m in shifting sand dunes, and the spatial association changed from positive to neutral in semi-fixed sand dunes. The seedlings were spaced in an almost random pattern around the adults, and their distances from the adults did not seem to affect their locations in semi-fixed sand dunes. Furthermore, spatial associations of the seedlings with the adults were negative in the fixed sand dune. These findings demonstrate that sand stabilization is an important factor affecting the spatial patterns of A. ordosica populations in the Mu Us desert. These findings suggest that, strong association between individuals may be the mechanism to explain the spatial pattern formation at preliminary stage of dune fixation. Sand dune stabilization can change the spatial pattern of shrub population by weakening the spatial association between native shrub individuals, which may affect the development direction of desert shrubs."
https://openalex.org/W1436804717,"This paper addresses the mechanical behavior of buried steel pipeline crossing subsidence strata. The investigation is based on numerical simulation of the nonlinear response of the pipeline-soil system through finite element method, considering large strain and displacement, inelastic material behavior of buried pipeline and the surrounding soil, as well as contact and friction on the pipeline-soil interface. Effects of key parameters on the mechanical behavior of buried pipeline were investigated, such as strata subsidence, diameter-thickness ratio, buried depth, internal pressure, friction coefficient and soil properties. The results show that the maximum strain appears on the outer transition subsidence section of the pipeline, and its cross section is concave shaped. With the increasing of strata subsidence and diameter-thickness ratio, the out of roundness, longitudinal strain and equivalent plastic strain increase gradually. With the buried depth increasing, the deflection, out of roundness and strain of the pipeline decrease. Internal pressure and friction coefficient have little effect on the deflection of buried pipeline. Out of roundness is reduced and the strain is increased gradually with the increasing of internal pressure. The physical properties of soil have a great influence on the mechanical properties of buried pipeline. The results from the present study can be used for the development of optimization design and preventive maintenance for buried steel pipelines."
https://openalex.org/W1576322529,"The aim of this study was to determine the minimal set of genetic alterations required for the development of a very low risk clinically symptomatic gastro-intestinal stromal tumour within the stomach wall. We studied the genome of a very low-risk gastric gastro-intestinal stromal tumour by whole-genome sequencing, comparative genomic hybridisation and methylation profiling. The studied tumour harboured two typical genomic lesions: loss of the long arm of chromosome 14 and an activating mutation in exon 11 of KIT. Besides these genetic lesions, only two point mutations that may affect tumour progression were identified: A frame-shift deletion in RNF146 and a missense mutation in a zinc finger of ZNF407. Whilst the frameshift deletion in RNF146 seemed to be restricted to this particular tumour, a similar yet germline mutation in ZNF407 was found in a panel of 52 gastro-intestinal stromal tumours from different anatomical sites and different categories. Germline polymorphisms in the mitotic checkpoint proteins Aurora kinase A and BUB1 kinase B may have furthered tumour growth. The epigenetic profile of the tumour matches that of other KIT-mutant tumours. We have identified mutations in three genes and loss of the long arm of chromosome 14 as the so far minimal set of genetic abnormalities sufficient for the development of a very low risk clinically symptomatic gastric stromal tumour."
https://openalex.org/W812564409,"Background Depression and anxiety are prevalent in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), yet psychological services are rarely accessible in CF clinics. This cross-sectional single center study reports on a psychological needs assessment of people with CF. Methods We asked adults attending a CF clinic, without integrated psychological services, to complete a psychological needs assessment survey that included items on: a) past access to psychological services (via a CF referral service), b) concerns relevant to discuss with a psychologist, and c) their likelihood of accessing psychological services if available at the CF clinic, and standardized measures of depression (CES-D) and anxiety (GAD-7). Results We enrolled 49 participants and 45 (91.8%) completed the survey. Forty percent reported elevated symptoms of depression and 13% had elevated anxiety. A majority of individuals (72.2% and 83.3%, respectively) indicated they would be likely to use psychological services, if available at the clinic. Concerns considered most relevant to discuss with a psychologist were: 1) worries (51.1%), 2) mood (44.4%), 3) life stress (46.6%), 4) adjustment to CF (42.2%), 5) life transitions (42.2%) and 6) quality of life (42.2%). Conclusions This study highlights the rationale for screening adults with CF for depression and anxiety, and to facilitate provision of psychological services and preventative mental health interventions as an integral component of multi-disciplinary CF care."
https://openalex.org/W771951675,"The study examines various combinations of levels of social isolation in private life and peripheral work position as predictors of disability pension (DP). A second aim was to test the potential interaction effects (above additivity) of social isolation and peripheral work position on the future risk of DP, and to provide results for men and women by age.The study was based on a sample of 45567 women and men from the Swedish population who had been interviewed between 1992 and 2007. Further information on DP and diagnoses was obtained from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency's database (1993-2011). The studied predictors were related to DP using Cox's proportional hazard regression. The analyses were stratified on sex and age (20-39 years, 40-64 years), with control for selected confounders.Increased risks of DP were found for most combinations of social isolation and peripheral work position in all strata. The hazard ratios (HRs) for joint exposure to high degree of social isolation and a peripheral work position were particularly strong among men aged 20-39 (HR 5.70; CI 95% 3.74-8.69) and women aged 20-39 (HR 4.07; CI 2.99-5.56). An interaction effect from combined exposure was found for women in both age groups as well as a tendency in the same direction among young men. However, after confounder control the effects did not reach significance.Individuals who were socially isolated and in a peripheral work position had an increased risk of future DP. The fact that an interaction effect was found among women indicates that a combination of social isolation and peripheral work position may reinforce adverse health effects. There was no evidence that a peripheral work position can be compensated by a high degree of social intergration in private life."
https://openalex.org/W1427771051,"We evaluated the utility of electronic loggers to measure the effects of a simple intervention designed to influence the rates of hand washing with soap within enclosed toilets and bathrooms in low-income urban households in Kerala, India. 58 households were given three items with embedded electronic loggers for a period of 2-5 days. Two logged soaps tracked hand and body washing in the bathroom. The third logged item was a water vessel used for flushing the toilet and for post-defecation anal cleansing; this served as a marker of toilet use. In addition, 28 households in a Soap by toilet arm were given an additional logged soap, to be kept by the toilet, and used for hand washing. Compared with the Soap in bathroom arm, the loggers in the Soap by toilet households recorded 73% greater daily use of soaps designated for hand washing (t(36)=2.92, p<0.01) and 172% greater use within 2 minutes of the use of the water vessel (t(36)=3.51, p = 0.001). We conclude that the loggers were capable of detecting changes in the rates of hand washing with soap and changes in hand washing with soap after use of the toilet. Further adoption of logger technologies would enable more insightful studies of hand washing within urban environments."
https://openalex.org/W1494191722,"Individuals are not perfectly consistent, and interindividual variability is a common feature in all varieties of human behavior. Some individuals respond more variably than others, however, and this difference may be important to understanding how the brain works. In this paper, we explore genetic contributions to response time (RT) slope variability on a reflexive attention task. We are interested in such variability because we believe it is an important part of the overall picture of attention that, if understood, has the potential to improve intervention for those with attentional deficits. Genetic association studies are valuable in discovering biological pathways of variability and several studies have found such associations with a sustained attention task. Here, we expand our knowledge to include a reflexive attention task. We ask whether specific candidate genes are associated with interindividual variability on a childhood reflexive attention task in 9–16 year olds. The genetic makers considered are on 11 genes: APOE, BDNF, CHRNA4, COMT, DRD4, HTR4, IGF2, MAOA, SLC5A7, SLC6A3, and SNAP25. We find significant associations with variability with markers on nine and we discuss the results in terms of neurotransmitters associated with each gene and the characteristics of the associated measures from the reflexive attention task."
https://openalex.org/W2110356743,"There is a general conception that positive associations to one’s trait, e.g. ‘I’m clever’, are beneficial for cognitive performance. Scientific evidence shows that this is a simplification. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we used written trial-based trait feedback ‘you are clever’, or task feedback ‘your choice was correct’, on each correct response of a rule-switching task, to investigate how the character of positive self-associations influences performance outcome. Twenty participants took part in this crossover design study. We found that trait feedback was less beneficial for motivation and performance improvement, and resulting in enhanced neural activation on more difficult bivalent rule trials. This indicates that the task was treated as more complex in this condition. For example, ‘you are clever’ feedback led to enhanced activation in anterior caudate nucleus, an area known to process uncertainty. We further observed that activation in anterior paracingulate cortex was sensitive to whether self-reflection was imposed by external feedback or generated from internal processes, where the latter activation correlated positively with performance when following after task feedback. Our results illustrate how feedback can evoke self-reflections that either help or hinder motivation and performance, most likely by impacting on processes of uncertainty. The results support social psychological models stipulating that trait focus take resources away from task focus."
