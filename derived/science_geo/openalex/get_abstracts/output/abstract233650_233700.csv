https://openalex.org/W2023407460,"Wnt signaling plays an important role in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. These biological effects are exerted by activation of the β-catenin/TCF transcription complex and consequent regulation of a set of downstream genes. TCF-binding elements have been found in the promoter regions of many TCF target genes and characterized by a highly conserved consensus sequence. Utilizing this consensus sequence, we performed an in silico screening for new TCF target genes. Through computational screening and subsequent experimental analysis, we identified a novel TCF target gene, DKK1, which has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of Wnt signaling. Our finding suggests the existence of a novel feedback loop in Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2075169994,"Although a number of target genes for the tumor suppressor p53 have been described, the mechanism of p53-dependent apoptosis is incompletely understood. Thus, it is essential to identify and characterize additional target genes that could mediate apoptosis. In the study reported here, we isolated a p53-regulated gene named NDRG1 (N-Myc down-regulated gene 1). Its expression is induced by DNA damage in a p53-dependent fashion. The promoter region of the NDRG1 gene contains a p53 binding site that confers p53-dependent transcriptional activation via a heterologous reporter. RNA interference and inducible gene expression approaches suggest that NDRG1 is necessary but not sufficient for p53-mediated caspase activation and apoptosis. This report further supports the notion that p53 controls a network of genes that are required for its apoptotic function.

This report further supports the notion that p53 controls a network of genes that are required for its apoptotic function. The tumor suppressor p53 is mutated and inactivated in about half of all human cancers examined (1Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7479) Google Scholar). The ability to induce cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death (apoptosis) is vital to its role as a tumor suppressor, thereby preventing the propagation of cells that may be undergoing malignant transformation. However, the molecular mechanism by which p53 initiates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis remains unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that the breast cancer tumor suppressor gene product BRCA1 functions as a molecular scaffold, assembling proteins involved in fine tuning the p53 response (2Hohenstein P. Giles R.H. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 489-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The p53 protein is almost undetectable in resting cells because of the action of its inhibitor MDM2, also a p53 target gene. This inhibitor stimulates the ubiquitination of p53 and targets it for degradation by the proteasome (3Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 directly controls the expression of its own negative regulator, creating a negative feedback loop. p53 protein levels have been shown to rise dramatically in response to diverse cellular stresses including ionizing and UV light irradiation, hypoxia, heat shock, viral infection, and treatment with chemotherapeutic agents (reviewed in Ref. 4Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Activated p53 is stabilized by posttranslational modifications, allowing it to either activate or repress a wide range of different gene targets. These targets, in turn, can regulate cell cycle and growth arrest, e.g. the target gene p21Waf1/Cip1 (p21) (5el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), or can lead to various other outcomes, including DNA repair and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 6Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). Particular interest has focused on identifying target genes of p53 that are involved in apoptosis, because the induction of cell death appears to be a critical tumor-suppressive effect (reviewed in Ref. 7Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). These targets are potential therapeutic candidates if they are capable of stimulating apoptosis in tumors. To date, a number of target genes have been implicated in p53-mediated apoptosis such as Bax, Bid, Noxa, PUMA, p53AIP1, PERP, p53DINP1, Pidd, Killer/DR5, Fas/Apo1, and PIG (p53-induced genes; reviewed in Ref. 8Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which p53 regulates apoptosis is unclear. Because no single gene has been shown to sufficiently mediate the full apoptotic effect, it is likely that p53 activates a network of apoptotic genes. To understand the apoptotic pathway(s), it is essential to identify and characterize additional targets. Using differential display (9Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar), we isolated a cDNA fragment that was up-regulated after p53 induction. Sequence results revealed that this transcript was identical to NDRG1 1The abbreviations used are: NDRG1, N-Myc down-regulated gene 1; Ab, antibody; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxy-methyl ester; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FDD, fluorescent differential display; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; siRNA, small interfering RNA.

To date, the exact biological function of NDRG1 remains obscure. Here, we report that NDRG1 is a direct transcriptional target gene of p53. Functional studies using RNA interference and inducible gene expression approaches suggest that NDRG1 is necessary but not sufficient for p53-induced apoptosis. In addition, this study describes a novel biological role of NDRG1 as a mediator of cell death, which is regulated by p53. Cell Culture and Treatment—The human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines HCT116 p53+/+ (expressing endogenous wild-type p53) and HCT116 p53–/– (with a targeted deletion of p53) (16Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1 (expressing a mutant, inactive form of p53) was a gift from R. Coffey (Vanderbilt University). HCT116 and DLD-1 cells were treated with 1 μm doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich) and harvested at the indicated time points. Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines DLD-1-tet (expressing a mutant, inactive form of p53 and a tetracycline-regulated transactivator) and DLD-1-p53 (expressing inducible wild-type p53 after tetracycline removal) were kindly provided by B. Vogelstein. The DLD-1-p53 cells correspond to the “A2 clone” of the tetracycline-controlled p53-inducible DLD-1 colon cancer cell line reported by Yu et al. (17Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Human lung metastatic carcinoma cell lines H1299-tet (lacking p53 and expressing a tetracycline-regulated transactivator) and H1299-p53 (expressing inducible wild-type p53 after tetracycline removal) were a gift from C. Prives (Columbia University, New York). The H1299-p53 cells correlate to the “p53-3 clone” of the metastatic lung cancer cell line H1299 with tetracycline-regulated p53 expression described by Chen et al. (18Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). All human colon cancer cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen), whereas the human lung cancer cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 10% CO2. To induce tetracycline-controlled gene expression in Tet-Off cell systems, tetracycline was removed from the culture medium using the following procedure. Cells were washed gently three times in the recommended medium either supplemented with tetracycline (no gene induction) or without tetracycline (gene induction). After a 1-hour incubation at 37 °C, all wash steps were repeated, and cell growth was allowed to proceed in the recommended medium. Fluorescent Differential Display (FDD)—FDD reactions were performed as described previously (19Stein S. Cho Y.J. Jackson II, R.S. Liang P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 234: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA from DLD-1-p53 cells with or without tetracycline was extracted using the RNApure Reagent (GenHunter). FDD-PCR reactions were carried out using the RNAspectra Red kit (GenHunter), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After cDNAs were generated from the 3′-termini of mRNAs, the PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was scanned with the Hitachi Genetic Systems FMBIO II fluorescence imaging system (Hitachi). Bands representing cDNAs of interest were excised from the gel. The cDNAs were eluted and re-amplified to avoid false-positive bands. All re-amplified cDNA fragments were extracted from the agarose gel with the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen), cloned into the pCR-TRAP vector (GenHunter), and sequenced (Vanderbilt University DNA Sequencing Facility). Northern Blotting—Northern blot analysis was used to confirm the differential gene expression results as described previously (19Stein S. Cho Y.J. Jackson II, R.S. Liang P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 234: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was isolated following the above protocol. Denatured total RNA (10 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on a 7% formaldehyde/1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Osmonics). The membrane was probed using the cloned FDD fragments that were radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming applying the HotPrime DNA labeling kit (GenHunter) according to the recommended instructions. Mini Quick Spin columns (Roche Applied Science) were applied to remove unincorporated nucleotides. Bands were visualized by autoradiography at –80 °C. Plasmids—Full-length human NDRG1 cDNA was constructed by reverse transcription PCR (Expand high fidelity polymerase; Roche Applied Science) using cellular cDNA and an expressed sequence tag clone (GenBank™ accession number BC003175; I. M. A. G. E. number 2957847) as templates. All obtained PCR products were sub-cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The ∼1.2 kb-coding region of human NDRG1 was cloned into either pCMV-tag2B (FLAG tag; Stratagene) or pBI-MCS-EGFP (kindly provided by B. Vogelstein) expression vectors to generate pCMV-FLAG-NDRG1 and pBI-NDRG1-EGFP, respectively. Sequences of primers and details about plasmid constructions are available upon request. In all cases, plasmids were purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), and inserts were checked for complete accuracy by sequencing (Vanderbilt University DNA Sequencing Facility). Stable Transfections—All transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pCMV-FLAG-NDRG1 and pBabe-hygromycin (GenHunter) plasmids were co-transfected into H1299-p53 cells. The pSUPER constructs combined with pBabe-puromycin (GenHunter) were co-transfected into DLD-1-p53 cells. DLD-1-NDRG1 (p53 mutant) and H1299-NDRG1 (p53 null) cells with inducible NDRG1 expression were generated by the transfection of DLD-1-tet (16Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar) and H1299-tet (17Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) cell lines with pBI-NDRG1-EGFP and pBabe-puromycin (GenHunter) plasmids. In all cases, single colonies were obtained in the presence of the corresponding selection marker after 3 to 6 weeks. All clones were analyzed by Western blotting for expression of NDRG1 and p53. Two separate stable clones per cell line were used in further experiments to exclude clone artifacts. RNA Interference—The small interfering RNA (siRNA) vector pSUPER was a gift from R. Agami (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The pSUPER-p53 and pSUPER-NDRG1 vectors were designed by our laboratory according to Brummelkamp et al. (20Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) and oligoengine.com. To establish pSUPER-NDRG1, two sequences were selected from the human NDRG1 cDNA (5′-GCATTATTGGCATGGGAAC-3′ (positions 398–416) and 5′-ATGCAGAGTAACGTGGAAG-3′ (positions 601 to 619), relative to the start codon). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing (Vanderbilt University DNA Sequencing Facility). Proliferation Assay—The DLD-1-NDRG1 and H1299-NDRG1 stable transfectants were plated on six-well tissue culture dishes (25,000 cells/well) in duplicate and incubated at 37 °C for 6 days. Each day, cells were trypsinized and counted using the Coulter particle counter (Beckman Coulter). Soft Agar Clonogenic Assay—The NDRG1-inducible stable cell lines were plated at 50,000 cells/plate on 35-mm tissue culture dishes containing a 0.8% agarose bottom layer and a 0.4% agarose top layer. The antibiotics G418 (250 μg/ml) and puromycin (10 μg/ml) were added to both layers. As a control, cells also were grown on soft agar plates containing tetracycline (1 μg/ml) to suppress NDRG1 expression. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3–4 weeks, and then the number of colonies >50 μm in diameter were quantitated using the Omnicon Colony Counter (Bausch and Lomb). Assays were performed in triplicate. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Total cell lysates were prepared in kinase lysis buffer as described previously (21Westfall M.D. Mays D.J. Sniezek J.C. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2264-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Aliquots (25–50 μg) of whole protein lysates were loaded onto SDS polyacrylamide (7 to 10%) gels for electrophoresis. For Western blot analysis, proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with each primary antibody (Ab) overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used in this study: p53 Ab-2 (OP09) and BRCA1 Ab-1 (OP92) (Oncogene Research Products); p21 Ab (sc-397) and MDM2 Ab (sc-965) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) Ab (9542) and cleaved caspase 3 Ab (kindly provided by B. Lu, Vanderbilt University) (9661, Cell Signaling); actin Ab (A2066) and FLAG M2 Ab (F3165) (Sigma-Aldrich); and Cap43 (NDRG1) antiserum (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Finally, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega) for at least 1 h at room temperature and detected using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (22Herzog B. Hall R.K. Wang X.L. Waltner-Law M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight at 4 °C using 2 μl of anti-p53 antiserum (kindly provided by J. Wang, Vanderbilt University). The primers used for the putative p53 binding site in the NDRG1 promoter were 5′-AAGTGAAGGGAGTCGCTCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTGCGCAAGCAGTCGTAG-3′ (reverse). The primer pair 5′-TTCAGCAGGAAGTGTTGTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGGGCATTGGGGTTTTTAC-3′ (reverse) upstream of this potential binding site was used as a negative control for this assay. Five microliters of purified DNA was utilized as a template for the PCR reaction. Precipitated DNA was amplified by standard PCR using Taq polymerase (Qiagen). PCR amplifications were performed as described previously (21Westfall M.D. Mays D.J. Sniezek J.C. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2264-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). PCR products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Luciferase Reporter Assay—The sequence of the human NDRG1 promoter region was assembled using public databases. Genomic DNA isolated from human 293T cells was kindly provided by N. Novac (Institute for Biomedical Research, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). Promoter-containing fragments were amplified in the presence of 6% Me2SO using Taq polymerase (BioTherm). For the wild-type p53 binding site (–573 to +30), 5′-AAAGAGCTCAAAGCGAAGGCGGCTGCTGGGCAGGCAGC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TTTGCTAGCCGAGGGCGGATGGTGAACTGACGAGCTTCAGC-3′ (reverse primer) were used. However, although the same reverse primer mentioned above was used for the deleted p53 binding site (–393 to +30), a different forward primer, 5′-AAAGAGCTCGCACAAGCACACAAACGCCTCCTC CGGGCAG-3′, was applied. The fragment containing point mutations in the p53 consensus site was amplified with the same primer set as that used for the wild-type p53 binding site (see above). The resulting mutant p53 binding site (–573 to +30) contained the following point mutations (shown in bold) that inactivated the consensus p53 binding site, namely 5′-CCATATACAGACGCACGAGCGCCCATATAAAC-3′. These point mutations were introduced by PCR. The obtained PCR products were cloned into the SacI and NheI site of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). All constructs were sequenced to verify the authenticity of the cloned promoter regions (Georg-Speyer-Haus DNA Sequencing Facility, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). These reporters (0.6 μg) were co-transfected into 293T cells (on 12-well plates) with either pCEP4-p53 (0.9 μg) or pCEP4 (0.9 μg) and SV40-β-Gal (0.1 μg) using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The β-galactosidase reporter was included as a control for transfection efficiency. After 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Mes-Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerin, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) was added to each well. Cells were collected by scraping and subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle followed by centrifugation. Supernatants were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase activity (10 μl of cell extract and 50 μl of luciferase buffer (300 μg/ml luciferin, 125 mm Mes-Tris, pH 7.8, 25 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm ATP)) was quantified by the Luminometer 953 (Berthold, Pforzheim, Germany) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. For β-galactosidase determination, 5 μl of cell extract was added to 180 μl of working lacZ buffer pH 7.0 (50 mm Na2HPO4 × 7H2O, 21 mm NaH2PO4 × H2O, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.28% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% SDS). After adding 18.5 μl of chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside substrate (15 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) to the mixture, reactions were incubated at 37 °C until an orange color was produced. At least three independent experiments were performed. Empty pGL3 basic vector served as a negative control. FACS Analysis—All cells were collected at the indicated time points and counted by the Coulter particle counter (Beckman Coulter). One milliliter of ice-cold propidium iodide mixture (40 μg/ml propidium iodide, 5 μg/ml RNase A, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 g/ml sodium citrate) was added to ∼1 × 106 cells. Cell suspensions were incubated for at least 30 min at 4 °C. Prior to performing FACS analysis, cells were filtered through a 53-μm nylon mesh (Small Parts). Fifteen thousand events per sample were analyzed using the FACScan system (Becton Dickinson) in conjunction with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Intracellular Calcium Release and Reverse Transcription PCR—To release intracellular calcium, cells were incubated with 10 μm calcium ionophore A23187 (antibiotic A-23187 (calcimycin); Biomol) for 24 h. To inhibit this release, cells were treated with the calcium chelator BAPTA/AM ester (10 μm; Biomol) for 24 h. Treated cells were harvested, and total RNAs were prepared as mentioned above followed by reverse transcription with MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. One microliter of cDNA was applied as a template for PCR amplifications. Standard PCR was performed using Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science). To amplify NDRG1, 24 PCR cycles (96 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s) were carried out with the primers 5′-ACAACCCCCTCTTCAACTACG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGACCACTTCCACGTTACTC-3′ (reverse). Primer sequences and PCR conditions for p21, BRCA1, and 18 S rRNA are available upon request. The PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. NDRG1 mRNA Is Up-regulated by p53—Although a number of p53 targets have been identified, the apoptotic pathway(s) initiated by p53 is (are) incompletely understood. To identify additional targets that are involved in this process, we screened the inducible p53 human colon cancer cell line DLD-1 (DLD-1-p53) using FDD (23Cho Y.J. Meade J.D. Walden J.C. Chen X. Guo Z. Liang P. BioTechniques. 2001; 30 (570, 572): 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Liang P. BioTechniques. 2002; 33 (346): 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Liang P. Pardee A.B. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These cells are committed to undergo apoptosis rapidly after p53 induction (17Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Therefore, to identify early p53-responsive genes, cells at 8- and 12-hour time points post tetracycline removal were analyzed. As a negative control, cells incubated in the presence of tetracycline were examined at corresponding time points. After completing a comprehensive FDD screen, several genes were identified, the expressions of which were reproducibly increased or decreased in response to p53 induction (data not shown). Among these genes we confirmed the expression of known p53 targets such as p21, HDM2 (the human homologue of MDM2), and PIG3 (26Stein S. Liang P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using the primer combinations H-AP3/G and H-AP17/G, we amplified two cDNA fragments (Fig. 1A) whose sequences corresponded to NDRG1. The expression of NDRG1 was markedly up-regulated following p53 induction (Fig. 1A). To confirm the expression of NDRG1 by elevated p53 in these cells, Northern and Western blot analyses were completed (Fig. 1, B and C). As shown in Fig. 1, NDRG1 was increased significantly 8 h after tetracycline removal in DLD-1-p53 cells, suggesting that it is an early p53-induced gene. To determine whether NDRG1 can be induced by endogenous p53 through DNA damage, the HCT116 p53+/+ cell line was analyzed. Induction of p53 expression following treatment with the DNA-damaging reagent doxorubicin resulted in elevation of NDRG1 expression (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, no increase in the basal level of NDRG1 was obtained in either HCT116 p53–/– or DLD-1 cells after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 1C and data not shown). These results suggest that p53 induction leads to the expression of endogenous NDRG1. Remarkably, NDRG1 expression was not detected in the inducible p53 human lung cancer cell line H1299 (H1299-p53) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, no changes in BRCA1 expression levels were obtained after p53 activation in these cells (Fig. 1C). Previous studies have demonstrated a functional interaction between these proteins, and it has been shown that BRCA1 enhances p53 transcription, whereas activated p53 represses BRCA1 (27Arizti P. Fang L. Park I. Yin Y. Solomon E. Ouchi T. Aaronson S.A. Lee S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7450-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28MacLachlan T.K. Dash B.C. Dicker D.T. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31869-31875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which we have confirmed in the colon cancer cells used in this study (Fig. 1C). In contrast, other downstream targets, such as p21 and HDM2, were readily induced after p53 induction in H1299-p53 cells (Fig. 1C and data not shown). In summary, these data indicate that NDRG1 expression induced by p53 occurs only in certain cells. p53 Binds to the NDRG1 Promoter in Vivo—p53 is a transcription factor that directly activates or represses the expression of genes containing its binding site(s) (BS) within their promoter regions (29el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Our observation that p53 expression results in a rapid induction of NDRG1 in colon cancer cells (Fig. 1) suggests that this gene is a direct transcriptional target. Therefore, we searched for potential p53 binding site(s) upstream of the NDRG1 gene using the data bank TFSEARCH (www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html). One such binding element was identified at 406 bp (Fig. 2A) upstream of the transcriptional initiation site of NDRG1 (30Masuda K. Ono M. Okamoto M. Morikawa W. Otsubo M. Migita T. Tsuneyoshi M. Okuda H. Shuin T. Naito S. Kuwano M. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 105: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether p53 binds to this site, in vivo ChIP assays were performed after inducing ectopic or endogenous p53 in DLD-1-p53 and HCT116 p53+/+ cells, respectively. The p53 antibody-immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were amplified with primers flanking a 282-bp region for the putative binding site of the NDRG1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 2B, the ChIP assays demonstrate that p53 binds to this site. As expected, no specific PCR products were amplified using primers binding upstream of this specific site (data not shown). Because p21 is a major downstream target of p53, we used the well characterized p53 binding site 1 (BS1) of the p21 promoter as a positive control for this assay (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine whether the p53 binding site of the NDRG1 gene was primarily responsible for the p53 responsiveness to transcriptional activation, we tested luciferase reporter constructs containing the wild-type, mutant, or deleted forms of the p53 binding site (Fig. 2C). 293T cells were co-transfected with the different reporter constructs in the absence or presence of p53. As shown in Fig. 2C, an increase in luciferase activity was observed for the wild-type p53 binding site in the presence of p53. In contrast, when the p53 binding site was either mutated or deleted, p53-mediated transcriptional activation was greatly diminished (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data provide the evidence that NDRG1 is a direct target gene of p53. Inducible Expression of NDRG1 Suppresses Cell Growth in Metastatic but Not in Non-Metastatic Cancer Cells—To further evaluate the biological role of NDRG1 in tumor cells, two different NDRG1-inducible cell lines were generated by transfection of the pBI-NDRG1-EGFP vector, namely the non-metastatic human colon cancer cell line DLD-1-NDRG1 (p53 mutant) and the metastatic human lung cancer cell line H1299-NDRG1 (p53 null). NDRG1 was induced in these cells after removal of tetracycline as confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A) and EGFP expression by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). No morphological changes were observed after its expression in either cell system or in comparison with the control cells transfected with pBI-MCS-EGFP vector alone (data not shown). To determine whether NDRG1 has any effect on cell growth, we performed proliferation assays with or without tetracycline (Fig. 3B). Our results demonstrate that NDRG1 induction inhibits cell proliferation of the metastatic H1299-NDRG1 lung cancer cells but has no influence on the non-metastatic DLD-1-NDRG1 colon cancer cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, enhanced NDRG1 expression in both cell lines fails to elicit any characteristic signs of apoptosis (data not shown). To further confirm that NDRG1 plays an inhibitory role in cell proliferation in the metastatic H1299-NDRG1 cells, we performed clonogenic assays (colony formation assays) to evaluate the ability of these cells to grow in soft agar. As shown in Fig. 3C, induction of NDRG1"

That study, however, did not address whether forced expression of Atf4 in non-osteoblastic cells would lead to osteoblast-specific gene expression, one of the most important features of a cell differentiation factor. To address this question we searched for cell lines that would not express Atf4. Contrasting with the restricted pattern of its protein accumulation, Atf4 mRNA was found in all cell lines and mouse tissues tested. Treatment of non-osteoblastic cells with MG115, a proteasome inhibitor, induced ATF4 accumulation and resulted in activation of an Osteocalcin promoter luciferase construct as well as expression of endogenous Osteocalcin, a molecular marker of differentiated osteoblasts and a target gene of ATF4. Eliminating the expression of β-TrCP1, an ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase interacting with ATF4 by RNA interference, led to ATF4 accumulation and to endogenous Osteocalcin expression in fibroblasts. These results indicate that the absence of ATF4 in most cell types is determined, at least in part, by an ubiquitination-dependent process. To our knowledge ATF4 is the first cell-specific transcription factor in which cell-specific distribution is achieved post-translationally. This study also establishes that ATF4, like other osteoblast differentiation factors, such as Runx2 and Osterix, has the ability to induce osteoblast-specific gene expression in non-osteoblastic cells.

This study also establishes that ATF4, like other osteoblast differentiation factors, such as Runx2 and Osterix, has the ability to induce osteoblast-specific gene expression in non-osteoblastic cells. The osteoblast, a cell of mesenchymal origin, is the only cell type responsible for extracellular matrix deposition in bone, a process called bone formation. Bone formation is a physiological process involved in skeletal growth, bone remodeling, and fracture repair (1Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). That diseases affecting bone formation are common and often debilitating (2Byers P.H. Bonadio J.F.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 387-389Google Scholar) underscores the biomedical importance of elucidating the molecular basis of osteoblast-specific gene expression and osteoblast differentiation. It is likely, as is the case in many cell lineages, that cell differentiation along the osteoblastic lineage is controlled, at least in part, by cell-specific transcription factors. To search for osteoblast-specific transcription factors that could also act as cell differentiation factors, we systematically analyzed the regulation of one of the two mouse Osteocalcin genes, OG2, the expression of which is strictly osteoblast-specific. Analysis of the OG2 promoter revealed that a 147-bp fragment, which can confer osteoblast-specific expression to a reporter gene in cell culture, contains two osteoblast cis-acting elements, termed OSE1 and OSE2 (6Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence indicated that both cis-acting elements are equally important. First, mutation of either one of them decreased the activity of a reporter construct containing a 147-bp fragment of the OG2 promoter (pOG2-Luc) only 50%. Second, multimers of either OSE1 or OSE2 were able to confer osteoblast-specific activity to a heterologous promoter in cell cultures (6Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 7Schinke T. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30182-30189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that the OSE2-binding protein was Runx2, a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation (8Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

More recent biochemical, molecular, and genetic studies revealed that the OSE1-binding protein is ATF4 (12Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S.

In accordance with the critical role of OSE1 in osteoblast gene expression, targeted disruption of Atf4 in mice causes perinatal lethality, dwarfism, and severe osteoporosis, which are abnormalities caused by a failure of osteoblasts to fully differentiate and to properly function. Moreover, ATF4 is the substrate in osteoblasts of RSK2, a gene encoding a kinase that is inactivated in Coffin-Lowry syndrome (12Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Previous studies did not address, however, whether ATF4, like the two other known osteoblast-specific transcription factors, Runx2 and Osterix (1Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar), can induce osteoblast-specific gene expression in non-osteoblastic cells, a hallmark of an osteoblast differentiation factor. In the course of addressing this question we uncovered a peculiar mechanism whereby a post-translational regulation of ATF4 controls its osteoblast-specific accumulation and thus its cell specificity. We also demonstrated that ATF4, like Runx2 and Osterix, has the ability to induce osteoblast-specific gene expression in non-osteoblastic cells. Cells and Reagents—All cell lines except for 2T3 mouse osteoblasts used in this study were purchased from ATCC. COS1 monkey kidney cells and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. C2C12 mouse myoblasts and S194 mouse lymphoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. ROS17/2.8 rat osteoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. 2T3 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Mundy's laboratory and maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. MG115 was purchased from Peptide International Inc. Gene Expression Analysis—Total RNA from different adult mouse tissues or mRNA from the indicated cell lines was isolated using TRIzol or the MessageMaker mRNA isolation system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. 10 μg of total RNA or 1 μg of mRNA of each sample was resolved in 1% agarose gel. After transferring the RNA samples onto a nylon membrane, the blot was then cross-linked by UV light and hybridized with either Atf4, Osteocalcin, or Gapdh, cDNA probes following standard protocols. For Western blot analysis, 25 μgof nuclear extracts isolated from the indicated cell lines, primary osteoblasts, and mouse tissues as described (18Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) were used. Antibody against ATF4 was raised as described (12Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C.

For in situ hybridization analyses, E16 mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. A 271-bp 5′-untranslated region of Atf4 was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR and used to generate 35S-labeled antisense riboprobes. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and DNA Transfection Assays—EMSA 1The abbreviations used are: EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. and DNA transfection assays were performed as described (6Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (5 μg) of the indicated sources were incubated with 5 fmol of a radiolabeled double-stranded OSE1 oligonucleotide (6Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) at room temperature for 10 min. For supershift assays, anti-ATF4 antibody (2 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was incubated with nuclear extracts prior to addition of the binding reaction mix. For DNA transfection experiments, COS1 cells were plated at a density of 5× 104/well in 12-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of wild-type or mutant forms of pOG2-Luc (a construct containing a 147-bp fragment of the OG2 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene (6Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar)) or wild-type or mutant p6OSE1-Luc (a vector containing 6 copies of OSE1, the binding site of ATF4 (6Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar)) and 0.05 μg of pRSV-βgal reporter vectors. MG115 (25 μm in Me2SO) was added 42 h post-transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed 48 h post-transfection. Data represent ratios of luciferase/β-galactosidase activity of at least three different experiments each done in triplicate performed for each DNA sample. RNA Interference Experiment—Double-stranded RNA molecules (siRNA) against N and C termini of β-TrCP1 or CDC4 were custom synthesized and transfected into NIH3T3 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The siRNA target mRNA sequences were: β-TrCP1N, AAA GGA GCU GUG UGU CAA GUA; β-TrCP1C, AAC AAG UAA AGG GGU UUA CUG; CDC4N, AAA AAU ACA GAA AAU AUG GGU; and CDC4C, AAC AGG ACA GUG UUU ACA AAC. Total RNA and nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h post-transfection. A Northern blot was hybridized using a probe containing a partial β-TrCP1 cDNA (1–516 bp), and Western blot analysis was performed using the ATF4 and Sp1 antibodies. Discrepancy between Atf4 Expression and ATF4 Accumulation—Osteocalcin is the most osteoblast-specific structural gene identified to date and is the latest molecular marker gene of the osteoblast phenotype (19Aubin J.E. Triffitt J.T. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 59-81Crossref Google Scholar). We showed recently that Osteocalcin is also a transcriptional target of ATF4 (12Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). However, we did not address in that study whether ATF4 has the ability to induce osteoblast-specific gene expression in non-osteoblastic cells. To answer this question, we intended to use as a readout the induction of Osteocalcin expression by ATF4 in cell lines of either mesenchymal origin such as NIH3T3 fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts or of non-mesenchymal origin such as COS1 kidney cells and S194 lymphoblasts. Prior to performing these experiments, we verified that ATF4 was absent in these cells. As expected, ATF4 could not be observed by either Western blot analysis or EMSA in any of these cell lines (Fig. 1A and data not shown). However, Atf4 mRNA was present in all cell types tested, and its abundance was similar to the one seen in osteoblastic cell lines (Fig. 1B). This observation was surprising given the restricted distribution of ATF4 and the limited number of tissues, i.e. bone, fetal liver, and eye, affected in Atf4-/- mice (12Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 20Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Sugihara A. Maekawa A. Terada N. Yoshida N. Akira S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Hettmann T. Barton K. Leiden J.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 110-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Masuoka H.C. Townes T.M. Blood. 2002; 99: 736-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To understand this discrepancy we further examined Atf4 expression and ATF4 accumulation in vivo. When analyzed by Northern hybridization, Atf4 was ubiquitously expressed although its level of expression was higher in calvaria, brain, thymus, liver, and lung than in other tissues (Fig. 1C). In contrast, when we performed Western blot analysis to assess the distribution of the ATF4 protein, we were struck by the marked difference between the high amount of ATF4 protein in osteoblasts compared with its absence in other tissues (Fig. 1D). This pattern, which was very reproducible from one Western blot to another, was strikingly different from what was seen when studying Atf4 expression as bone was not the site of highest expression. This discrepancy also led us to analyze whether Atf4 has a more restricted expression pattern during development. Although Atf4 is highly expressed in the developing skeleton, it was also expressed, at a comparable level, in organs such as liver, lung, and intestine (Fig. 2). Thus Atf4 expression pattern during development and after birth contrasts with the limited distribution of the protein and the limited set of functions that have been identified to date through genetic means for this gene. Inhibition of ATF4 Proteasomal Degradation Leads to Ectopic Osteoblast Gene Expression—A yeast two-hybrid system screen using β-TrCP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a bait identified ATF4 as a β-TrCP1-interacting protein (23Lassot I. Segeral E. Berlioz-Torrent C. Durand H. Groussin L. Hai T. Benarous R. Margottin-Goguet F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This observation led us to test whether the absence of ATF4 in non-osteoblastic cells could be explained, at least in part, by a proteasomal degradation mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we treated non-osteoblastic cell lines such as NIH3T3, C2C12, S194, and COS1 cells that have no detectable ATF4 protein with MG115. MG115 is a proteasome inhibitor that acts by blocking the N-terminal threonine in the active site of the β-subunit of the 26 S proteasomal complex (24Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 25Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). Following MG115 treatment for 5 h, nuclear extracts were isolated from these cells and used either in Western blot or in EMSA. As shown in Fig. 3A, MG115 treatment of all indicated non-osteoblastic cells led to the accumulation of ATF4 in their nuclei. Likewise, MG115 treatment led to the appearance of an OSE1 binding activity in nuclear extracts of these cells as determined by EMSA (Fig. 3B). That the OSE1 binding activity contains ATF4 was determined by a supershift experiment using an ATF4 antibody (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that ATF4 is degraded more readily in non-osteoblastic cells than in osteoblasts. Taking into account this peculiar mechanism used by ATF4 to achieve osteoblast-specific accumulation, we then asked whether ATF4 could induce osteoblast-specific gene expression in cells other than osteoblasts. We first performed DNA transfection experiments using the activity of pOG2-Luc as a readout. This OG2 promoter fragment contains 1 copy of OSE1 (the ATF4 binding site) and 1 copy of OSE2 (the Runx2 binding site) and is virtually inactive in COS1 cells that do not express Osteocalcin (6Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). MG115 treatment of COS1 cells following transfection with pOG2-Luc resulted in a 5-fold increase in luciferase activity of this vector (Fig. 3C). This increase in reporter activity was secondary to accumulation of ATF4 and ATF4 binding to OSE1, as a mutation in OSE1 that prevents ATF4 from binding to DNA nearly abolished this increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 3C). In contrast, a mutation in OSE2 that prevents Runx2 from binding to DNA did not affect the MG115-induced increase in luciferase activity of pOG2-Luc following MG115 treatment (Fig. 3C). Likewise, the activity of p6OSE1-Luc, a vector containing 6 copies of OSE1, the cis-acting element to which ATF4 binds (12Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), was increased 12-fold following MG115 treatment of transfected COS1 cells. In contrast, MG115 treatment did not increase more than 3-fold the activity of p6OSE2-Luc, a vector containing 6 copies of the cis-acting element to which Runx2 binds (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that preventing ATF4 proteasomal degradation increases the activity of luciferase reporter constructs containing 1 or several copies of OSE1, the ATF4 binding site. Next we asked whether MG115 treatment of non-osteoblastic cells could induce endogenous Osteocalcin expression. mRNA from cells treated with MG115 or vehicle was analyzed by Northern blot. Osteocalcin expression was detected in all tested non-osteoblastic cells, including C2C12 myoblasts, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and even S194 lymphoblasts (Fig. 3E). Taken together, our data indicate first, that proteasomal degradation is one mechanism accounting for the absence of ATF4 in non-osteoblastic cells, and second, that ATF4 is an osteoblast differentiation transcription factor as defined by its ability to induce ectopic Osteocalcin expression. Inactivation of β-TrCP1 Leads to Osteoblast-specific Gene Expression in Non-osteoblastic Cells—Having established that ATF4 can induce ectopic osteoblast-specific gene expression in cell lines of different origins, we next used one of these cell types, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, to analyze the molecular pathway leading to ATF4 degradation. In eukaryotes, one signature for protein degradation by the 26 S proteasome is attachment of polyubiquitin to a target protein, a process involving three sequential enzymatic events that include activation (E1), conjugation (E2), and ligation (E3). E3 determines the specificity of targets; hence it is the key to controlling individual target protein abundance. Two mammalian E3 ligase complexes, SCFskp2 and SCFβTrCP1, have been identified to date (26Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). The observation that β-TrCP1, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacts with ATF4 and leads to its proteasomal degradation in HeLa cells (23Lassot I. Segeral E. Berlioz-Torrent C. Durand H. Groussin L. Hai T. Benarous R. Margottin-Goguet F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) prompted us to test whether it was a molecular link explaining, at least in part, the absence of ATF4 in non-osteoblasts. To test this hypothesis we relied on RNA interference (siRNA) to decrease endogenous β-TrCP1 expression. Introduction of siRNAs targeting β-TrCP1 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts did result in a virtual absence of β-TrCP1 transcripts. This effect was specific because targeting through siRNAs of a related gene, CDC4, which encodes another mouse E3 ligase, failed to completely abolish β-TrCP1 expression (Fig. 4A). The decrease of β-TrCP1 expression caused by disrupting CDC4 expression was not sufficient to affect ATF4 accumulation indicating that β-TrCP1 was still active and able to trigger ATF4 ubiquitination. As a result of β-TrCP1 inactivation, there was an accumulation of ATF4 in nuclear extracts of NIH3T3 fibroblasts as shown by Western blot (Fig. 4B) and expression of endogenous Osteocalcin in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 4C), further demonstrating that ATF4 can induce ectopic osteoblast-specific gene expression and that removal of a specific E3 ligase is sufficient to achieve this result. This function of β-TrCP1 was specific because decreasing CDC4 expression did not induce ATF4 accumulation or Osteocalcin expression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 4, A–C). Osteocalcin was the only tested gene for which expression was up-regulated in NIH3T3 cells following inactivation of β-TrCP1. This is consistent with the fact that Osteocalcin is a known target gene of ATF4 (12Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that one mechanism explaining the accumulation of ATF4 in osteoblasts is the absence or decrease of its ubiquitination in this cell type. We next asked whether this was because of the absence of β-TrCP1 expression in osteoblasts. Northern blot analysis of multiple tissues demonstrated that β-TrCP1 is expressed in osteoblasts albeit at a slightly reduced level (Fig. 4D). This result indicates that the cell specificity of ATF4 accumulation is not because of the absence of β-TrCP1 expression in osteoblasts. This study establishes that ATF4 has the ability to induce expression of at least one osteoblast-specific gene, Osteocalcin, in non-osteoblastic cell types. ATF4 shares this property with Runx2 and Osterix, the two known osteoblast differentiation factors to date (1Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Whether ATF4, like Runx2, has the ability to induce differentiation of non-osteoblastic cell types in vivo may be more difficult to determine because of the unexpected finding reported in this study. This is, however, a question of critical importance given the critical role for ATF4 as a regulator of osteoblast terminal differentiation and function (12Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The fact that Osteocalcin was the only osteoblast-specific gene the expression of which was up-regulated by the inactivation of β-TrCP1 does not exclude this possibility. Indeed, ATF4 affects osteoblast function to a large extent by regulating amino acid imports and Type I collagen synthesis without affecting Type I collagen expression. Thus it is possible that, if it can be achieved, stabilization of ATF4 in non-osteoblastic cells in vivo may up-regulate Type I collagen synthesis by favoring amino acid import. ATF4 accumulation contrasts strikingly with the near ubiquitous expression of the gene encoding it. This discrepancy is explained, at least in part, by the fact that ATF4 is degraded in most cells except osteoblasts and a few other cell types. Indeed, osteoblast is not the only cell type affected by Atf4 disruption. For instance Atf4-/- mice are blind because of a defect in eye lens fibers (20Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Sugihara A. Maekawa A. Terada N. Yoshida N. Akira S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Hettmann T. Barton K. Leiden J.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 110-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Likewise, ATF4 is required for fetal hematopoiesis (23Lassot I. Segeral E. Berlioz-Torrent C. Durand H. Groussin L. Hai T. Benarous R. Margottin-Goguet F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and the differentiation of the lamina propria layer of the vas deferens (27Fischer C. Johnson J. Stillwell B. Conner J. Cerovac Z. Wilson-Rawls J. Rawls A. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus in this regard, ATF4 cannot be viewed as being solely an absolute osteoblast-specific transcription factor; however, the severity and complexity of the bone phenotype observed in the absence of ATF4 establishes the importance of this factor for bone formation. Moreover, Atf4 deletion has no overt phenotypic consequences in tissues where it is highly expressed, such as brain, kidney, and lungs or other organs. This discrepancy between Atf4 expression and ATF4 accumulation is unique among cell-specific transcription factors and could have several explanations that are not necessarily exclusive. It could be that in the cells where ATF4 does not appear to be critically important in vivo another transcription factor can contribute for its functions. Alternately and/or in addition, it may be that ATF4 is protected from degradation in osteoblasts and a few other cell types. We show here that it is the case that ATF4 appears to be ubiquitinated in most of the cells except osteoblasts. This ubiquitination process requires β-TrCP1 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The fact that β-TrCP1 is expressed in osteoblasts suggests the existence of an additional molecular link to explain ATF4 accumulation. Presumably this molecular link could be the yet to be characterized kinase phosphorylating ATF4 at serine 219 prior to ubiquitination (23Lassot I. Segeral E. Berlioz-Torrent C. Durand H. Groussin L. Hai T. Benarous R. Margottin-Goguet F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) that would be absent in osteoblasts or a deubiquitination mechanism specific to osteoblasts. Further study aimed at identifying this kinase or enzyme responsible for removing the polyubiquitin will allow us to address this question. Regardless of the complexity of these mechanisms, ATF4 is, to our knowledge, the first cell-specific transcription factor the distribution of which is controlled to a large extent post-translationally. In addition, our data propose a molecular basis supporting the existence of a control of bone formation by inhibition of the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation machinery as recently reported (28Garrett I.R. Chen D. Gutierrez G. Zhao M. Escobedo A. Rossini G. Harris S.E. Gallwitz W. Kim K.B. Hu S. Crews C.M. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1771-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar).

To investigate the role of cellular senescence in aging it is necessary to define the time-dependent molecular events by which it is characterized. Here we investigated changes in levels of key proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and stress resistance in senescing human fibroblasts following oxidative stress. An immediate response in stressed cells was dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) and cessation of DNA synthesis. This was followed by sequential induction of p53, p21, and p16. Increase in hypophosphorylated Rb and induction of p53 and p21 by a single stress treatment was transient, whereas sustained induction or dephosphorylation were achieved by a second stress. Down-regulation of the critical DNA replication initiation factor Cdc6 occurred early after stress concurring with p53 induction, and was followed by a decrease in Mcm2 levels. A late event in the stress-induced molecular sequence was the induction of SOD1, catalase, and HSP27 coinciding with development of the fully senescent phenotype. Our data suggest that loss of proliferative capacity in oxidatively stressed cells is a multistep process regulated by time-dependent molecular events that may play differential roles in induction and maintenance of cellular senescence. Cellular senescence can result from short, dysfunctional telomeres, oxidative stress, or oncogene expression, and may contribute to aging.

Our data suggest that loss of proliferative capacity in oxidatively stressed cells is a multistep process regulated by time-dependent molecular events that may play differential roles in induction and maintenance of cellular senescence. Normal human fibroblasts only have a limited proliferative capacity in vitro and will become senescent eventually (1Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar). Although cellular senescence is mainly observed with cells in culture, several lines of evidence suggest that a similar process occurs in vivo and contributes to aging (Ref. 2Campisi J. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar and references therein). Telomere shortening because of the end replication problem is believed to be the prime intrinsic cause that limits the cell proliferation capacity because critically shortened telomeres serve to activate the senescence process (3Chiu C.P. Harley C.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 214: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, various stresses such as DNA damaging agents, oxidative stress, and certain oncogene overexpression can also induce cellular senescence (4Chen Q.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4130-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 5Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W.

Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The cell culture condition of 20% O2 might represent an oxidative stress when compared with the much lower in vivo physiological pressure of O2 (8Sherr C.J. Depinho R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 407-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 9Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 10Parrinello S. Samper E. Krtolica A. Goldstein J. Melov S. Campisi J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Thus telomere shortening may be driven to a large extent by stress, and telomere shortening by the end replication problem may set an upper limit to the replicative lifespan, which might only seldom be reached (11Martin-Ruiz C. Saretzki G. Petrie J. Ladhoff J. Jeyapalan J. Wei W. Sedivy J. von Zglinicki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17826-17833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The free radical theory of aging proposes that reactive oxygen species produced in mitochondria cause damage to cellular macromolecules, thus resulting in a decline of cellular function and organism aging (12Harman D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 928: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). This theory has gained strong support from studies that linked oxidative stress to longevity using model organisms including yeasts, nematodes, flies, and rodents (13Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3094) Google Scholar, 14Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7195) Google Scholar). Mutations that increase longevity are often associated with increased antioxidant activity and improved resistance to oxidative stress (15Lin Y.J. Seroude L. Benzer S. Science. 1998; 282: 943-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 16Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G.

Physiol. 2003; 547: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). One of our most striking observations is that the rate of growth in early life has profound effects on longevity. Fetal growth restriction followed by postnatal catch-up growth in male rats and mice results in reduced longevity (19Jennings B.J. Ozanne S.E. Dorling M.W. Hales C.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Ozanne S.E. Hales C.N. Nature. 2004; 427: 411-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Male rats most frequently die of renal failure (19Jennings B.J. Ozanne S.E. Dorling M.W. Hales C.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We have shown that the reduced longevity of fetally growth restricted, postnatally growth caught-up male rats is associated with accelerated shortening of telomeres in the kidney (21Cherif H. Tarry J.L. Ozanne S.E. Hales C.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We have suggested that this shortening is associated with accelerated senescence of renal cells with earlier renal failure and death. It seems unlikely that replicative senescence alone could lead to the degree of shortening observed and therefore telomere shortening consequent upon oxidative damage may be involved (21Cherif H. Tarry J.L. Ozanne S.E. Hales C.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Toussaint O. Dumont P. Remacle J. Dierick J.F. Pascal T. Frippiat C. Magalhaes J.P. Zdanov S. Chainiaux F. ScientificWorld J. 2002; 2: 230-247Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have further speculated that telomeres not only function as a measure of the number of cell divisions undergone by telomerase-negative cells but also, by virtue of their GGG content, monitor oxidative damage by the accelerated telomere shortening that results (23Oikawa S. Kawanishi S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).The present study was undertaken to study a selection of key proteins involved in DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, DNA replication licensing, and stress resistance in oxidatively senescing cells by exploiting a model cell line in vitro. Knowledge of the molecular markers of oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence will allow us to study the progress of cell senescence in vivo. It has been shown that early passage human fibroblasts can be induced into senescence prematurely by oxidative stress (4Chen Q.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4130-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 24Chen Q.M. Bartholomew J.C. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem.

Because the cells develop features of senescence within 7 days and the time course for developing senescent features is well defined, oxidatively stressed human fibroblasts provide a useful experimental model to study the underlying mechanism and markers of senescence-associated aging. Here we show that oxidative stress causes loss of proliferative capacity and induction of senescence in human fibroblasts by well defined sequential molecular events.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures and H2O2 Treatment—IMR-90 cells at population doubling (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PD, population doubling; BrdUrd, 2-bromo-5-deoxyuridine; SA-β-gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Rb, retinoblastoma; SOD, superoxide dismutase; HSP, heat shock protein; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PML, promyelocytic leukemia protein. 24.5 were obtained from the America Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cells were grown in ATCC modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells for H2O2 treatment were prepared from exponential phase around PD30. H2O2 treatment was carried out 24 h after seeding by incubating 2 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes in 13 ml of the culture medium containing 600 μm H2O2 for 2 h. For a second H2O2 treatment the cells were split 1:3 after being cultured for 4 days following the first treatment and treated again for 2 h with 600 μm H2O2 24 h after seeding. IMR-90 cells reached replicative senescence at PD59.BrdUrd Labeling and SA-β-Gal Assay—Cells were seeded and treated as described above in dishes containing autoclaved coverslips. For BrdUrd labeling, coverslips were transferred into a 6-well plate and incubated in 2 ml of the culture medium containing 10 μm BrdUrd for 48 h. Cells on coverslips were then washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed twice in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and washed in PBS. DNA was denatured by incubation in 2 m HCl for 1 h followed by three washes with PBS. Coverslips were incubated for 1 h with fluorescein-conjugated mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (1:20 dilution; Alexis Biochemicals) and with DNA stain TOTO-3′-iodide (0.5 μm; Molecular Probes), washed three times with PBS, and mounted in 90% glycerol, 10% PBS containing p-phenylenediamine (1 mg/ml; Sigma). For senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) assay, cells on coverslips were washed twice in PBS, fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed three times in PBS, and incubated at 37 °C overnight in flesh SA-β-gal staining solution (1 mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactosidase (stock = 100 mg/ml of dimethylformamide)/ml of 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl in 40 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate, pH 6.0) (26Dimri G.P.

At least 500 cells from each time point were scored under microscope for BrdUrd- or SA-β-gal assay.Western Blotting—Whole cell lysate was prepared by scraping cells in Laemmli buffer (0.12 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol with protease inhibitors (mixture from Sigma)). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Sigma) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. 25 μg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were probed with the following antibodies: anti-p53 antibody (ab7757, abcam), anti-p21 antibody (H-164, Santa Cruz), anti-p16 antibody (H-156, Santa Cruz), anti-Rb antibody (G3–245, BD Pharmingen), anti-Cdc6 antibody (180.2, Santa Cruz), anti-Mcm2 antibody (BM28, Transduction Laboratories), anti-Mcm5 antibody (27Stoeber K. Halsall I. Freeman A. Swinn R. Doble A. Morris L. Coleman N. Bullock N. Laskey R.A. Hales C.N. Williams G.H.

The bound primary antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), followed by enhanced chemiluminesence (Amersham Biosciences). The densities of the bands were quantified using an Alpha Imager (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA).Preparation of Nuclei and Cytosolic Extracts—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by hypotonically swelling cells in ice-cold LS buffer (20 mm potassium-HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), scrape harvesting, and Dounce homogenization as described previously (28Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Krude T. Romanowski P. Marheineke K. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Cytosolic supernatant was taken from the first spin (2,000 × g in a Whatman Micro-Centrifuge for 2 min) and respun at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant fractions were then aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear pellets from the first separating spin were resuspended in an equal volume of ice-cold SuNaSp/bovine serum albumin solution (250 mm sucrose, 75 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm spermine tetrahydrochloride, 0.15 mm spermidine trihydrochloride, 3% bovine serum albumin) and respun at 2,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was discarded and the packed nuclear pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of SuNaSp/bovine serum albumin, frozen, and stored at -80 °C.In Vitro DNA Synthesis Assay—DNA replication reactions containing 30 μl of elongation buffer (60 mm KCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm spermine tetrahydrochloride, 0.5 mm spermidine trihydrochloride), a buffered mixture of NTPs, dNTPs, and an energy regeneration system (yielding a final concentration of 40 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.8, 7 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 0.1 mm each of GTP, CTP, UTP, 0.1 mm each of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP, 0.25 μm biotin-16-dUTP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm creatine phosphate, and 5 μg of phosphocreatine kinase) and 1 × 105 nuclei were performed as previously described (28Stoeber K.

Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For detection by immunofluorescence, the nucleotide mixture was supplemented with a final concentration of 0.25 μm biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Diagnostics). In vitro DNA replication reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Nuclei in the DNA replication assays were resuspended in PBS (0.5 ml) and fixed for 5 min by adding an equal volume of 8% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, nuclei were spun through 30% sucrose/PBS onto polylysine-coated coverslips. All subsequent washing and staining steps were carried out in PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.04% SDS. Coverslips were washed, stained for incorporated biotin-16-dUTP with fluorescein-linked streptavidin (1:100 dilution, Amersham Biosciences) and for DNA with propidium iodide/RNase A (both at 50 ng/ml, Sigma), washed again, and mounted in vectorshield (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). Confocal fluorescence microscopy of random fields of nuclei was performed on a Leica TCS DMRE confocal microscope. Images were collected, and merged pictures of the propidium iodide channel (red) and fluorescein channel (green) were obtained using Adobe Photoshop with standardized brightness- and contrast-enhanced operations of all samples. Images were printed, and the number of nuclei incorporating biotin-16-dUTP in vitro (yellow) and non-replicating nuclei (red) were counted. Routinely, 800–1000 nuclei were scored for each replication reaction and quantitated as percentages of the total number of nuclei that synthesized DNA in vitro.RESULTSCessation of DNA Replication and Induction of Senescence in the H2O2-treated Cells—To understand molecular mechanisms underlying aging, we investigated key cell cycle regulatory proteins and stress-resistant factors in normal human diploid fibroblasts that were subjected to oxidative stress. We adopted H2O2 treatment to induce premature cellular senescence. Doseresponse experiments showed that the cells could tolerate up to 600 μm H2O2 for 2 h with very few lethal effects under the conditions used in this study (data not shown). A small fraction of the cells that received a single H2O2 treatment were able to recover and re-enter the cell cycle. This was manifested by the gradual increase of cell number after the treatment. Indeed, about 20% of the treated cells incorporated BrdUrd 5 days after a first H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1A). We therefore reseeded the cells at a ratio of 1:3 4 days after the first treatment and performed a second treatment 24 h later. The second H2O2 treatment caused a permanent cell cycle arrest for over 95% cells. As shown in Fig. 1A BrdUrd positive cells decreased to less than 4% after the second H2O2 treatment and eventually became undetectable 4 days later. Cells stressed with H2O2 twice eventually developed senescence phenotypic features including enlarged and flattened morphology and SA-β-gal activity. The fully developed phenotypic features appeared 4 days after the second H2O2 treatment when over 95% cells displayed SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 1B). This result shows that a second oxidative stress is necessary to induce a high incidence of premature senescence.Induction of Cell Cycle Checkpoint Proteins in the H2O2-treated Cells—Among the cell cycle checkpoint proteins investigated, p53 was rapidly increased by oxidative stress (Fig. 2A). This was followed by the induction of p21, which is a target of p53 (Fig. 2A). Both proteins tended to return to basal level if the induction was caused by a single H2O2 treatment. Sustained induction of p53 and p21 was seen in the cells that received two H2O2 treatments (Fig. 2A). An elevated p16 level was only observed in the cells that received two H2O2 treatments and developed senescent phenotypic features (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Changes in levels of cell cycle checkpoint proteins and phosphorylation of Rb in H2O2-treated cells. A, H2O2-treated IMR-90 cells were harvested at the indicated time points and whole cell lysates (25 μg of proteins) were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against p53, p21, and p16. Loading was revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. Indicated on the top are the times after H2O2 treatment and the number of H2O2 treatments. This experiment is representative of two independent experiments. B, changes in the phosphorylation state of Rb in the samples used for panel A were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody against Rb. Hyperphosphorylated Rb and dephosphorylated Rb were analyzed by densitometry and the ratio of the two is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Dephosphorylation of Rb was also induced by H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2B). The ratio of hyperphosphorylated Rb (pRb) to dephosphorylated Rb decreased from 53% in control cells to 43% in cells a half-hour after a 2-h H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2B). The ratio returned to the control level 5 days after the treatment. However, the second H2O2 treatment caused a sustained decrease in hyperphosphorylated Rb, which eventually became undetectable 1 day after the second treatment and remained dephosphorylated thereafter (Fig. 2B).Decrease of DNA Replication Proteins in the H2O2-treated Cells—Cdc6, Mcm2, Mcm5, and PCNA are proteins involved in DNA replication (30Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Apart from Mcm5 that remained largely unaffected, they generally decreased in the H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 3A). Cdc6 became undetectable in the cells that received two H2O2 treatments and had the senescent phenotype fully developed (Fig. 3A). However, a residual amount of Mcm2 and a substantial amount of PCNA remained detectable in the twice H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Changes in levels of DNA replication and stress-resistance proteins in H2O2-treated cells. A, H2O2-treated IMR-90 cells were harvested at the indicated time points and whole cell lysates (25 μg of proteins) were analysed by Western blotting using antibodies against Cdc6, Mcm2, Mcm5, and PCNA. Loading was revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. Indicated on the top are the times after H2O2 treatment and the number of H2O2 treatments. This experiment is representative of two independent experiments. B, H2O2-treated IMR-90 cells were harvested at the indicated time points and whole cell lysates (25 μg of proteins) were analysed by Western blotting using antibodies against catalase, SOD1, HSP70, and HSP27. Loading was revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. Indicated on the top are the times after H2O2 treatment and the number of H2O2 treatments.

Levels of the stress response protein HSP70 did not change noticeably in the H2O2-treated cells, whereas HSP27 showed a slight increase in the treated cells that also showed high SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 3B).Molecular Events in Replicatively Senescing Cells—To confirm that molecular events induced by oxidative stress are similar to those in replicatively senescing cells, we examined changes in p53, p21, p16, and Mcm2 in cells when they were in early population doubling (PD30), in a near senescent state (PD57), and in the fully established replicative senescent state (4 weeks into replicative senescence). As shown in Fig. 4, p53 and p21 increased substantially in the near replicative senescent cells but declined in the fully senescent cells. A significant increase in p16 was only observed in the fully senescent cells (Fig. 4). On the other hand, Mcm2 decreased substantially in the near replicative senescent cells and was undetectable in the fully senescent cells (Fig. 4). These data suggest that time-dependent changes in molecular events observed in the oxidatively senescing cells occur similarly in the replicatively senescing cells but over a much longer time frame.Fig. 4Changes in levels of p53, p21, p16, and Mcm2 in replicatively senescing cells. Whole cell lysates (25 μg of proteins) from IMR-90 cells of early population doubling, near replicative senescence, and 4 weeks into replicative senescence were analyzed by Western blotting using respective antibodies. Actin is shown as a loading control.

To investigate the immediate consequences of oxidative stress in the cells we examined molecular events in earlier time points after H2O2 treatment. Induction of p53 can be detected at the end of the 2-h H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5). The highest induction was observed 2 h later. Thereafter it declined gradually and returned to almost the basal level 5 days later. This rapid induction of p53 was repeated after a second H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5). Induction of p21 was detected 2 h later than that of p53 with the highest induction being seen 6 h after the 2-h H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5). Expression of p16 was not affected by H2O2 treatment during this early time course (Fig. 5). H2O2 treatment caused a decrease in the ratio of hyperphosphorylated Rb to dephosphorylated Rb in the cells. This change was detected in the cells that received treatment for only 1 h (Fig. 5). Densitometry analysis showed that the ratio decreased from 60% in the control cells to 46% in the 1-h H2O2-treated cells. Further decreases were seen in subsequent time points and the hyperphosphorylated Rb eventually became undetectable 10 h after the 2-h H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5). The hyperphosphorylated Rb reappeared a day after the treatment and returned to the control level 5 days later (Fig. 5). The second H2O2 treatment caused a similar change in the ratio in the cells at the end of the treatment (Fig. 5). In contrast, the DNA replication protein Mcm2 remained unchanged during the initial 24 h after the first H2O2 treatment with a slight decrease only being seen 5 days later and 2 h after a second H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5). Changes in levels of Cdc6 showed a similar pattern to that of Mcm2 (data not shown).Fig. 5Molecular events in the early time points after H2O2-treatment. H2O2-treated IMR-90 cells were harvested at the indicated time points and whole cell lysates (25 μg of proteins) were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against p53, p21, p16, Rb, and Mcm2. Actin is shown as a loading control.

A 1-h H2O2 treatment caused an almost 10-fold decrease in DNA synthesis as compared with the untreated cells (83% BrdUrd positive cells). At the end of the 2-h H2O2 treatment BrdUrd positive cells decreased to 2.7%. A further decrease was observed 2 h later. A slight recovery was observed 4 h after the 2-h H2O2 treatment (Fig. 6A). Thus cessation of DNA replication was a rapid responsive event that preceded any detectable changes in protein levels of p53, p21, p16, Mcm2, and Cdc6 (see Fig. 5).Fig. 6Acute inhibition of DNA synthesis is because of inhibition of DNA elongation in H2O2-treated cells. A, control and H2O2-treated IMR-90 cells were incubated with BrdUrd for 48 h and its incorporation was detected with fluorescein-conjugated antibody. The data represent the mean of two independent experiments. Insets are merged images from a representative BrdUrd incorporation assay for control and 1-h H2O2-treated cells. B, nuclei were prepared from control and 2-h H2O2-treated cells and incubated for 3 h in elongation buffer substituted with ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates and an energy regeneration system. Nuclei are stained with propidium iodide to reveal DNA (red) and with fluorescein-streptavidin (green) to detect biotin-dUTP incorporation resulting from in vitro DNA synthesis. Merged images are shown. Results are expressed as the percentage of nuclei replicating and summarized in the histogram. The data represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Rapid cessation of DNA replication in the H2O2-treated cells suggested that any ongoing DNA synthesis during S-phase must have been halted by the stress. To test this hypothesis we employed a cell-free in vitro DNA replication assay and compared DNA synthesis in elongation buffer using nuclei prepared from control and 2-h H2O2-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 6B, only 1.8% of nuclei prepared from H2O2-stressed cells were capable of DNA synthesis in contrast to the control in which about 10% of nuclei were synthesizing DNA (Fig. 6B). Note that the relatively low percentage of replicating nuclei compared with that detected by a 48-h BrdUrd labeling (Fig. 6A) is because of the short incubation period of the in vitro replication reaction (3 h). This suggests that elongation during S-phase was inhibited by H2O2 t"
https://openalex.org/W2070701799,"DNA damage that is not repaired with high fidelity can lead to chromosomal aberrations or mitotic cell death. To date, it is unclear what factors control the ultimate fate of a cell receiving low levels of DNA damage (i.e. survival at the risk of increased mutation or cell death). We investigated whether DNA damage could be introduced into human cells at a level and frequency that could evade detection by cellular sensors of DNA damage. To achieve this, we exposed cells to equivalent doses of ionizing radiation delivered at either a high dose rate (HDR) or a continuous low dose rate (LDR). We observed reduced activation of the DNA damage sensor ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and its downstream target histone H2A variant (H2AX) following LDR compared with HDR exposures in both cancerous and normal human cells. This lack of DNA damage signaling was associated with increased amounts of cell killing following LDR exposures. Increased killing by LDR radiation has been previously termed the inverse dose rate effect, an effect for which no clear molecular processes have been described. These LDR effects could be abrogated by the preactivation of ATM or simulated in HDR-treated cells by inhibiting ATM function. These data are the first to demonstrate that DNA damage introduced at a reduced rate does not activate the DNA damage sensor ATM and that failure to activate ATM-associated repair pathways contributes to the increased lethality of continuous LDR radiation exposures. This inactivation may reflect one strategy by which cells avoid accumulating mutations as a result of error-prone DNA repair and may have a broad range of implications for carcinogenesis and, potentially, the clinical treatment of solid tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2042470484,"Malignant transformation of melanocytes frequently coincides with loss of E-cadherin expression. Here, we show that loss of E-cadherin leads to induction of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activity in melanoma cell lines. Melanoma cells show constitutively active NFκB, whereas no activity is found in primary melanocytes. After re-expression of E-cadherin in melanoma cells, strong downregulation of NFκB activity was found. Consistently, NFκB activity was induced in primary human melanocytes after inhibition of E-cadherin activity by functionally blocking anti-E-cadherin antibodies. Interestingly, re-expression of E-cadherin-blocked p38 MAPK activity and the p38 MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190 almost completely prevented NFκB activation in melanoma cells. Furthermore, cytoplasmatic β-catenin induced p38 and NFκB activation in malignant melanoma. To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting a correlation between E-cadherin and NFκB activity in melanocytes and melanoma cells. In summary, we conclude that loss of E-cadherin and cytoplasmatic β-catenin induces p38-mediated NFκB activation, potentially revealing an important mechanism of tumorigenesis in malignant melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W2036237432,"The neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor protein, merlin, functions as a negative growth regulator; however, the molecular mechanisms that underlie merlin regulation remain elusive. Recent studies have implicated merlin phosphorylation in regulating merlin subcellular localization and growth suppression. P21-activated kinase (PAK), a downstream target of Rac1/Cdc42, directly phosphorylates merlin at Serine 518. In this report, we show that PAK2 directly phosphorylates wild-type merlin, whereas merlin truncation mutants with impaired GST-amino-terminal domain (N-term or NTD)/GST-carboxy-terminal domain (C-term or CTD) intramolecular association exhibit impaired S518 phosphorylation. We directly demonstrate that PAK2 phosphorylation impairs merlin N-term/C-term binding in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, we show that PAK2 phosphorylation impairs the ability of merlin to bind to two interacting proteins, CD44 and hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS), both critical for merlin growth suppression. These observations suggest that merlin S518 phosphorylation directly modulates merlin intramolecular and intermolecular associations important for the ability of merlin to function as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2020512831,"The high-risk HPV E6 proteins have been shown to direct the degradation of a variety of cellular proteins that contain PDZ domains. Although some of these proteins are involved in regulating processes of cell growth and polarity in Drosophila, little is known about their function in higher eukaryotic epithelial cells. In HPV-containing cells derived from cervical tumours, we find that the patterns of expression of the E6 targets hDlg (discs large), hScrib (Scribble), and MUPP1 are consistent with their being substrates for E6-induced degradation. It is also clear that, in the case of hDlg, E6 is specifically targeting nuclear pools of the protein rather than membrane-bound forms. We have also analysed the activity of a subset of E6 target proteins in the suppression of oncogene-induced cell transformation. Interestingly, Dlg, MAGI-1 and MUPP1 efficiently suppressed cell transformation, while MAGI-2 and MAGI-3 were ineffective in this assay. These results suggest that in the context of HPV-induced transformation Dlg, MAGI-1 and MUPP1 can function as tumour suppressors."
https://openalex.org/W2164443997,"Rab5 and Rab4 are small monomeric GTPases localized on early endosomes and function in vesicle fusion events. These Rab proteins regulate the endocytosis and recycling or degradation of activated receptor tyrosine kinases such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). The p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase contains a BH domain with sequence homology to GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), but has not previously been shown to possess GAP activity. In this report, we demonstrate that p85α has GAP activity toward Rab5, Rab4, Cdc42, Rac1 and to a lesser extent Rab6, with little GAP activity toward Rab11. Purified recombinant Rab5 and p85α can bind directly to each other and not surprisingly, the p85α-encoded GAP activity is present in the BH domain. Because p85α stays bound to the PDGFR during receptor endocytosis, p85α will also be localized to the same early endosomal compartment as Rab5 and Rab4. Taken together, the physical co-localization and the ability of p85α to preferentially stimulate the down-regulation of Rab5 and Rab4 GTPases suggests that p85α regulates how long Rab5 and Rab4 remain in their GTP-bound active state. Cells expressing BH domain mutants of p85 show a reduced rate of PDGFR degradation as compared with wild type p85 expressing cells. These cells also show sustained activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt pathways. Thus, the p85α protein may play a role in the down-regulation of activated receptors through its temporal control of the GTPase cycles of Rab5 and Rab4."
https://openalex.org/W1966678470,"The VRK1 kinase is a novel Ser-Thr kinase in the human kinome that diverged from the casein kinase 1 branch. These kinases phosphorylate transcription factors related to stress responses, such as p53. In this report we have studied the phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun in its N-terminal region. The VRK1 protein phosphorylates c-Jun with a Km of 0.4 muM, and is not inhibited by SP600125. VRK1 phosphorylates c-Jun in Ser63 and Ser73 in vitro, the same residues targeted by the N-terminal kinase of c-Jun (JNK). This phosphorylation induces the stabilization and accumulation of the c-Jun protein. VRK1 phosphorylates the endogenous c-Jun in Ser63. VRK1 activates c-Jun dependent transcription, which is dependent on phosphorylation of Ser63 and Ser73. The c-Jun with Ser63Ala and Ser73Ala substitutions is not transcriptionally active when cotransfected with VRK1. VRK1 interacts with c-Jun but not with JNK. The cotransfection of VRK1 and JNK has an additive effect on the transcriptional activation of c-Jun indicating that they can cooperate when both are at suboptimal dose; otherwise, maximum effect by one of them prevents the effect of the other. The VRK1-c-Jun connection represents a component of a new signaling pathway whose upstream elements remain to be identified."

PI3K catalyzes the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which constitutes a second messenger for activating downstream components such as AKT. Subsequently, the activated AKT causes tumor cell survival/inhibition of apoptosis, induces proliferation and cell growth, and stimulates angiogenesis by phosphorylating numerous downstream targets (1Vivanco I.

Ito M. Harada M. Yamakawa M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which LY294002 induces apoptosis has not been studied in detail.Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a primary target of AKT, which inactivates GSK-3 function by phosphorylation. GSK-3 was initially described as an enzyme involved in glycogen metabolism, but for now it is known to regulate a diverse array of cell functions (11Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 12Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). A number of studies have linked GSK-3 to apoptosis and cell proliferation. Overexpression of GSK-3 induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (13Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Increased cAMP levels promote survival of neuronal cells by inactivating GSK-3β via a protein kinase A-dependent mechanism (14Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). GSK-3β inhibits anti-apoptotic molecules, including heat shock factor-1 and the associated expression of heat shock protein (15Xavier I.J. Mercier P.A. McLoughlin C.M. Ali A. Woodgett J.R. Ovsenek N.

In contrast, findings in other cell types suggest that GSK-3β mediates cell survival. For example, disruption of the murine GSK-3β gene caused embryonic lethality because of increased hepatic apoptosis, which may associate with excessive production of tumor necrosis factor (16Hoeflich K.P.

Because it has been suggested that PI3K signaling promotes tumorigenesis in human colorectal cancer cells (17Khaleghpour K. Li Y. Banville D. Yu Z. Shen S.H. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), it is of great interest to determine whether GSK-3 counteracts the anti-apoptotic effect of the PI3K pathway and promotes apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-activated gene (NAG-1) (also known as MIC-1, GDF-15, PTGFB, PDF, and PLAB) represents a divergent member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily (18Baek S.J.

Although some of these dietary factors induce NAG-1 expression via the p53 tumor suppressor protein (23Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Eling T.E.

Thus, several pathways may affect NAG-1 expression, and NAG-1 seems to be the final target protein of several anti-tumorigenic compounds.In the present study, we identify NAG-1 as a novel downstream target of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway. The inhibition of PI3K or AKT, which results in the activation of GSK-3β, enhanced NAG-1 expression. The down-regulation of GSK-3β gene by small interference RNA (siRNA) and GSK-3β inhibition using a specific GSK-3β inhibitor abolished LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor)-induced NAG-1 expression. Therefore, these data demonstrated that NAG-1 is one of the downstream proteins of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway, which may explain LY294002-induced apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Reagents, and Construction of Plasmids—Human colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT-116) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin (10 μg/ml).

Chem. 2001; 276: 33384-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HCT-116 cells were plated in 12-well plates at 105 cells/well in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After growth for 16 h, plasmid mixtures containing 0.5 μgof NAG-1 linked to luciferase and 0.05 μg of pRL-null (Promega, Madison, WI) were transfected by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection, the media were replaced with serum-free media, and the inhibitors were added. Cells were harvested in 1× luciferase lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined and normalized to the pRL-null luciferase activity using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI).Western Blot Analysis—Cells were grown to 60–80% confluency in 6-cm plates followed by 0–48 h of treatment in the presence of the indicated inhibitors. Total cell lysates were isolated using RIPA buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors, and the soluble protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred for 1 h onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk in TBS/Tween 0.05% (TBS-T) and probed with each antibody (1:1000 dilution, 5% skim milk in TBS-T) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBS-T, the blots were treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and washed several times. The signal was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). The contour length of signal on images was measured using the program Scion Image.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. NAG-1 cDNA was labeled with biotin-N4-dCTP using Biotin Random Primer Kit (Pierce). Total RNA (10 μg) was separated on 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes. Hybridization and chemiluminescent signal detection was performed using North2South Chemiluminescent Hybridization and Detection Kit (Pierce).RNA Interference—GSK-3α/β siRNA was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. HCT-116 cells were transfected with the GSK-3α/β siRNA at a concentration of 50 nm or negative control siRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX), using TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with serum-free media containing vehicle or LY294002. The cells were incubated for 24 h and harvested to perform Western blot analysis.Cell Proliferation Assay—The cell proliferation assay was performed using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). The assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. In 96-well plates, cells were plated at 1,000 cells/well in 100 μl of media. After 16 h, the cells were treated with LY294002 in the presence of serum and incubated for different time points. Methanethiosulfonate/phenazine methosulfate solution (20 μl/well) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Absorbance was read at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Universal Microplate Reader, ELX 800, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT).Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Analysis—The DNA contents for vehicle- and LY294002-treated HCT-116 cells were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). HCT-116 cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates, incubated for 16 h, and then treated with LY294002 in the presence of serum. The cells (attached and floating cells) were then harvested, washed with PBS, fixed by the slow addition of cold 70% ethanol to a total of 1 ml, and stored at –20 °C overnight. The fixed cells were pelleted, washed with PBS, and stained in 0.5 ml of 20 μg/ml propidium iodide solution. A total of 10,000 cells was examined by flow cytometry using Beckman Coulter Epixs XL equipped with ModFit LT software by gating on an area versus width dot plot to exclude cell debris and cell aggregates. Apoptosis was measured by the level of sub-diploid DNA content.RESULTSEffect of Kinase Inhibitors on NAG-1 Expression—In order to gain insight into signaling factors regulating NAG-1 expression, we screened several kinase-specific inhibitors at the concentration that does not deviate from their selectivity. HCT-116 cells were treated with vehicle, staurosporine (1 μm), Ro31-8220 (0.5 μm), U0126 (2 μm), PD98059 (20 μm), AG490 (50 μm), LY294002 (50 μm), or SB203580 (10 μm) for 24 h. The cell lysates were harvested, and Western blot analysis was performed. Among them, Ro31-8220 (protein kinase C inhibitor), AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor), and LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) highly induced NAG-1 expression, and the signal intensities increased more than 2-fold compared with that from vehicle (Fig. 1). Because PI3K is considered to regulate various cellular processes such as apoptosis, proliferation, growth, and cytoskeletal rearrangement (1Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5077) Google Scholar, 2Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 3Roche S. Koegl M.

Expression of NAG-1 was induced by LY294002 in a concentration-dependent manner, with a high increase in expression observed at 50 μm (Fig. 2A). We have also examined time-dependent expression of NAG-1. As shown in Fig. 2B, NAG-1 was induced by LY294002 treatment at 6–12 h. In addition, GSK-3β was de-phosphorylated by LY294002 treatment, which is consistent with previous evidence that PI3K inhibition leads to a decrease in the phosphorylation and hence the activation of GSK-3β. Although there is strong evidence that PI3K activates AKT by phosphorylation, which is likely responsible for many biological consequences of PI3K activation, PI3K has also been shown to regulate the activation of other cellular targets such as the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase and the small GTP-binding proteins RAC1 and CDC42 in an AKT-independent manner (1Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5077) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether AKT is the downstream target of PI3K regarding LY294002-induced NAG-1 expression. A selective AKT inhibitor, 1l-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate was incubated with HCT-116 cells, and NAG-1 expression was measured. As shown in Fig. 2C, NAG-1 was induced in the presence of the AKT inhibitor as well as PI3K inhibitor, indicating that NAG-1 induction by LY294002 may be directly linked to the PI3K/AKT pathway.Fig. 2LY294002 and AKT inhibitor induce NAG-1 expression in HCT-116 cells.A, HCT-116 cells were treated with LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor (1–50 μm), for 24 h in the absence of serum. B, HCT-116 cells were treated with LY294002 (50 μm). At the indicated times, the cell lysates were harvested to perform Western blot analysis using indicated antibodies. C, HCT-116 cells were treated with 1l-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate, a selective AKT inhibitor (10 μm), for 24 h in the absence of serum. The cell lysates were harvested, and 30 μg of total proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effects of PI3K Inhibition on Cell Growth and Apoptosis in HCT-116 Cells—To investigate the effects of PI3K inhibition on the cell growth of HCT-116 cells, the cells were treated at several concentrations of LY294002. A concentration-dependent inhibition of cell growth was observed, and 50 μm LY294002 completely arrested cell growth (Fig. 3A). Subsequently, FACS analysis was performed to determine whether LY294002 affects apoptosis as measured by sub-G1 population of the cells. FACS analysis revealed that 50 μm LY294002 caused the significant increased apoptosis (vehicle, 1.3 ± 0.3%; LY294002, 6.6 ± 1.4%) (Fig. 3B) and G1 cell cycle arrest (Table I). In addition, the LY294002-induced apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V staining, which can detect early apoptotic cells, and the result showed that LY294002 caused a 3-fold increase compared with vehicle-treated HCT-116 cells (data not shown). These data are consistent with previous reports, which show that LY294002 induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis in the other cell lines (29Li D.M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Taken together with previous reports, our data indicate the inhibition of PI3K results in growth arrest, apoptosis induction, and G1 cell cycle arrest in human colorectal cancer cells.Fig. 3Inhibition of PI3K causes growth retardation and induction of apoptosis.A, HCT-116 cells were plated at 1,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate and treated with several concentrations of LY294002 (1–50 μm). Cell growth was measured using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay. Each value represents mean ± S.D. from 4 to 5 replicate experiments. B, HCT-116 cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and treated with LY294002 (50 μm).

Open table in a new tab GSK-3β Mediates LY294002-induced NAG-1 Expression— Several downstream targets of AKT have been identified including GSK-3β, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), BAD, IκB kinase, and MDM2 (1Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5077) Google Scholar). To clarify the responsible downstream components of AKT regarding LY294002-induced NAG-1 expression, lithium chloride, a GSK-3 inhibitor, or rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, was used. HCT-116 cells were treated with lithium chloride in the presence of LY294002 or rapamycin alone because AKT inactivates GSK-3 or activates mTOR by phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4A, rapamycin treatment had no effect on the NAG-1 expression; however, lithium chloride suppressed the expression of NAG-1 induced by LY294002 in a concentration-dependent manner. Because lithium chloride is a nonspecific inhibitor for GSK-3α and GSK-3β, isomer-specific inhibitors were used. Additional AR-A014418 (GSK-3β specific inhibitor) (34Bhat R. Xue Y. Berg S. Hellberg S. Ormo M. Nilsson Y. Radesater A.C. Jerning E. Markgren P.O. Borgegard T. Nylof M. Gimenez-Cassina A. Hernandez F. Lucas J.J. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. J. Biol.

Treatment with 50 μm AR-A014418 alone slightly decreased the NAG-1 expression (data not shown).Fig. 4GSK-3β is required for induction of NAG-1 expression by LY294002.A, HCT-116 cells were pretreated with lithium chloride (1–20 mm), a GSK-3 inhibitor, for 30 min prior to the addition of LY294002 (50 μm). Rapamycin (1–50 nm), an mTOR inhibitor, was incubated for 24 h in the absence of LY294002. B, HCT-116 cells were pretreated with AR-A014418 (1–50 μm), for 30 min prior to the addition of LY294002. After 24 h, the cell lysates were harvested to perform Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)GSK-3β Plays an Important Role for LY294002-induced NAG-1 Promoter Activity and Apoptosis—To obtain further evidence that PI3K inhibition induces NAG-1 expression through GSK-3β, we have examined the NAG-1 promoter activity in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor. The 3.5-kb NAG-1 promoter and the deletion clones were transfected into HCT-116 cells and were then treated with LY294002 (50 μm) with or without AR-A014418 (50 μm). As shown in Fig. 5A, a significant increase in luciferase activity was observed in treatment with LY294002 in all the NAG-1 promoter constructions (pNAG3500/LUC, pNAG1086/LUC, and pNAG133/LUC). However, the inhibition of GSK-3β by AR-A014418 suppressed the luciferase activity to the levels of vehicle-treated cells. These results are consistent with Western blot analysis, shown in Fig. 4B. Based on the result showing that GSK-3β inhibition suppresses LY294002-induced NAG-1 expression and the promoter activity, we investigated the effects of AR-A014418 on apoptosis. HCT-116 cells were treated with LY294002 with or without AR-A014418, and expression of PARP, which is target of caspases, was analyzed. An increased cleavage of PARP was detected in the cells treated with LY294002, compared with that with vehicle. However, AR-A014418 was able to restore the LY294002-increased cleavage of PARP, which suggests that AR-A014418 treatment could block the LY294002-induced apoptosis in HCT-116 cells (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5GSK-3β mediates LY294002-induced NAG-1 promoter activity and apoptosis.A, the NAG-1 promoter constructs were described previously (28Baek S.J.

Each construct (0.5 μg) was cotransfected with 0.05 μg of pRL-null vector into HCT-116 cells using LipofectAMINE, and then the cells were treated with vehicle, or LY294002 (50 μm), and/or AR-A014418 (50 μm). After 24 h, the promoter activity was measured by luciferase activity. Transfection efficiency for luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase (pRL-null vector) activity. Relative luciferase units (RLU) indicate firefly luciferase activity/Renilla luciferase activity. Each value represents mean ± S.D. from six independent transfections. B, HCT-116 cells were treated with LY294002 (50 μm) and/or AR-A014418 (50 μm) for 24 h. The cell lysates were harvested to perform Western blot analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2036208378,"The mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) is involved in the control of the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization during apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. Indeed, the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), two major components of PTPC, are the targets of a variety of proapoptotic inducers. Using co-immunoprecipitation and proteomic analysis, we identified some of the interacting partners of ANT in several normal tissues and human cancer cell lines. During chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, some of these interactions were constant (e.g. ANT-VDAC), whereas others changed strongly concomitantly with the dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and until nuclear degradation occurred (e.g. Bax, Bcl-2, subunits of the respiratory chain, a subunit of the phosphatase PP2A, phospholipase PLC β 4 and IP3 receptor). In addition, a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) interacts with ANT in normal tissue, in colon carcinoma cells and in vitro. This interaction is lost during apoptosis induction, suggesting that GST behaves as an endogenous repressor of PTPC and ANT pore opening. Thus, ANT is connected to mitochondrial proteins as well as to proteins from other organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum forming a dynamic polyprotein complex. Changes within this ANT interactome coordinate the lethal response of cells to apoptosis induction."

Most become obese and diabetic, but a significant fraction remains lean and diabetic or lean and non-diabetic. Here, we performed microarray analysis of “metabolic” transcripts expressed in liver and hindlimb muscles to evaluate: (i) whether expressed transcript patterns could indicate changes in metabolic pathways associated with the different phenotypes, (ii) how these changes differed from the early metabolic adaptation to short term high fat feeding, and (iii) whether gene classifiers could be established that were characteristic of each metabolic phenotype. Our data indicate that obesity/diabetes was associated with preserved hepatic lipogenic gene expression and increased plasma levels of very low density lipoprotein and, in muscle, with an increase in lipoprotein lipase gene expression. This suggests increased muscle fatty acid uptake, which may favor insulin resistance. In contrast, the lean mice showed a strong reduction in the expression of hepatic lipogenic genes, in particular of Scd-1, a gene linked to sensitivity to diet-induced obesity; the lean and non-diabetic mice presented an additional increased expression of eNos in liver. After 1 week of high fat feeding the liver gene expression pattern was distinct from that seen at 9 months in any of the three mouse groups, thus indicating progressive establishment of the different phenotypes. Strikingly, development of the obese phenotype involved re-expression of Scd-1 and other lipogenic genes.

The current epidemic of obesity leads to an increased occurrence of type 2 diabetes (1Zimmet P. Alberti K.G.M.M. Shaw J. Nature. 2001; 414: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (4469) Google Scholar). The change in nutrition, in particular the consumption of diets rich in calories, coming in great part from lipids, appears as a major contributor to obesity development (2Hill J.O. Wyatt H.R. Reed G.W. Peters J.C. Science. 2003; 299: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). Genetic predispositions, however, also cooperate with changes in nutritional behavior in the development of the common forms of obesity and diabetes. In rare instances, mutations in single genes, for instance those for leptin, leptin receptor, melanocortin 4 receptor, proopiomelanocortin, or proconvertase genes (3Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M.

But even in these cases, the impact of a given mutation may be strongly modified by the genetic background. This is exemplified by the various phenotypes caused by the ob/ob mutation when present in different mouse strains (7Coleman D.L. Hummel K.P. Diabetologia. 1973; 9: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and by the widely different degree of glucose intolerance caused by targeted mutations of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate genes in mice with different genetic background (8Kulkarni R.N. Almind K. Goren H.J. Winnay J.N. Ueki K. Okada T. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the absence of targeted mutations, the susceptibility of rodents to develop obesity and/or diabetes in response to high fat diet feeding is also strongly dependent on the genetic background, with some strains being very sensitive and others completely resistant (9Buchanan T.A. Fisler J.S. Underberger S. Sipos G.F. Bray G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: R785-R789PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nagase H. Bray G.A. York D.A. Am. J.

These observations, as well as genetic linkage studies in humans, suggest that complex gene-gene interactions define the degree of susceptibility to these metabolic diseases and that most of the genes involved contribute individually only to a small extent to the overall pathogenic risk. Besides the genetic basis for variability in gene expression and function, there is now strong evidence that epigenetic mechanisms may participate in the development of several diseases. This has been well established in cancer biology (13Momparler R.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6479-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 14Feinberg A.P. Tycko B. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar) where the impact of epigenetic variations, in particular DNA or histone methylation, may cause oncogenic transformation of somatic cells. The impact of epigenetic variations on metabolic diseases is less well characterized, but there is increasing interest in evaluating how such mechanisms may contribute to these pathologies (15Maier S. Olek A. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2440S-2443SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Friso S. Choi S.W. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2382S-2387SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). A striking recent report has demonstrated that variable degrees of methylation of the viable agouti (Avy) allele can be obtained upon changes in food composition that lead to corresponding variations in this allele expression and changes in coat color (17Waterland R.A.

Crivelli V. DaCosta A. Roy-Tirelli A. Thorens B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E834-E842Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Approximately 50% of the HFD mice became obese and diabetic (ObD mice), whereas ∼12% remained lean and diabetic (LD mice), and ∼12% lean and non-diabetic (LnD mice); the rest of the mice displayed intermediary phenotypes. The differential metabolic adaptation was first observed as an increase in glucose intolerance after 3 months of HFD feeding followed by a progressive and differential increase in body weight so that the three distinct groups were observed at 6 months and well established at 9 months. Euglycemic clamp analysis revealed that the different groups of mice were all insulin-resistant. This was associated, in fasted ObD mice, with a decreased glucose clearance rate and hyperinsulinemia; in LD mice with normal glucose clearance in the presence of hyperglycemia and relative insulinopenia; in LnD mice, with increased glucose clearance in the presence of mild insulinopenia. Furthermore, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by muscles isolated from each type of mice was indistinguishable from that of normal chow fed mice thus indicating that insulin resistance was mostly induced by the diabetic milieu rather than caused by muscle gene expression defects. Thus, evaluation of the molecular events underlying the differential metabolic adaptation of C57Bl/6 mice to HFD feeding should provide interesting and important information about the pathogenesis of obesity/diabetes but also about the changes in gene expression associated with resistance to obesity and/or diabetes development. In addition, because the mice studied were genetically homogenous, these data may lead to an appreciation that changes in gene expression may be controlled by non purely genetic factors. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the expression pattern of a set of “metabolic” genes in liver and muscles of the HFD mice. We showed that there were marked changes in the expression of genes that together suggested that obesity/diabetes was associated with an increase in lipid flux from the liver to the periphery and that an increase in fatty acid uptake by muscle could explain the various levels of insulin resistance in the different subgroups. The lean phenotype was associated with a reduced liver expression of Scd-1 and of other lipogenic genes, and the mice resisting diabetes development were characterized by increased expression of eNos in liver. Finally, the expression profiles showed group-specific characteristics, which were sufficiently consistent so that automated gene selection and classification methods showed good discrimination in a cross-validation test. In particular, genes whose RNA expression levels are good indicators of a diabetic condition could be identified. Animals and RNA Preparation—Four- to five-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (IFFACREDO, L'Arbresle, France) were fed a normal chow (NC) diet (energy content: 12% fat, 28% protein, and 60% carbohydrate) or a high fed diet (HFD) (energy content: 72% fat (corn oil and lard), 28%protein, and <1% carbohydrate) for 9 months. Their body weight and tolerance to intraperitoneal glucose injections (AUC: area under the curve) were determined as described previously (18Burcelin R. Crivelli V. DaCosta A. Roy-Tirelli A. Thorens B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E834-E842Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These two criteria were used to classify the mice in three subgroups, lean non-diabetic (LnD), lean diabetic (LD), and obese diabetic (ObD), which represented 11.8%, 12.4%, and 47.2%, respectively, of the total population of mice. The rest of the mice displayed intermediate phenotypes (18Burcelin R. Crivelli V. DaCosta A. Roy-Tirelli A. Thorens B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E834-E842Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from the liver and muscle of the HFD and NC mice according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). Polyadenylated (poly(A)+) RNA was isolated by one round of selection with oligo(dT) cellulose (Sigma), and its quality was analyzed by Northern blot detection of GLUT-2 mRNA for liver and β-actin mRNA for muscle. Samples presenting no sign of degradation were used for microarray analysis. Probes for cDNA Microarray Preparation—Using gene-specific primers, PCR products with an average length of 300–600 bp were obtained by RT-PCR using RNA from liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, hypothalamus, and βTc-tet cells. After purification by agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1Topo (Invitrogen), sequenced-verified, and amplified by PCR using the gene-specific primers (GATC Biotech AG, Konstanz, Germany). The PCR products were purified either using the MultiScreen-PCR, 96-Well Filtration System for PCR products (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany), the PeqGOLD AmpliPure HTI 96 Kit/V 96-Well Filtration System for PCR products (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) or the Qiaquick-96 columns (Qiagen). An aliquot of each purified PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for evaluation of quality and quantity. After lyophilization, the amplified inserts were resuspended in 10 μl of spotting solution (1.5 m betaine, 3 × SSC: 0.45 m NaCl, 0.045 m sodium citrate) and distributed in 384-well microtiter plates. Their final concentration was adjusted to 100–500 ng/μl. Control genes for data normalization included ribosomal genes mRNAs. Printing of cDNA Microarrays—Microarray printing was done according to published methods (20Schena M. Shalon D. Davis R.W. Brown P.O. Science. 1995; 270: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (7510) Google Scholar, 21Shalon D. Smith S.J. Brown P.O. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 22Eisen M.B.

Briefly, PCR products were arrayed onto reactive aldehyde-coated microscope slides (Peqlab QMT slides, Erlangen, Germany and SuperAldehyde slides, Telechem International) using a high precision gridding robot (GeneMachines, San Carlos, CA) fitted with four printing tips (Telechem International). Post-printing slide treatments were performed as recommended by the supplier, and slides were stored at room temperature. RNA Labeling and Hybridization—RNA samples from the HFD animals were always treated individually, whereas RNAs from control animals were pooled after isolation and quality control. Two differently labeled fluorescent probes (RNA from HFD mice labeled with Cy5 versus RNA from control mice labeled with Cy3) were prepared by indirect labeling according to published protocols (www.microarrays.org/pdfs/amino-allyl-protocol.pdf). Amino allyl dUTP was incorporated during a single round of reverse transcription using 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA (liver) or 50 μg of total RNA (muscle) and primed with 38 pmol of dT21-VN and SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The free amine group of the amino allyl dUTP was subsequently coupled to a reactive N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester of the fluorescent dyes (Cy5 and Cy3 from Amersham Biosciences). Labeled cDNAs were subsequently dried under vacuum until a final volume of 2 μl, and the following components were added to obtain 13 μl of hybridization solution (final concentrations of tetramethylammonium chloride 2.65 m, 0.38% SDS, 19 ng/μl yeast tRNA (Invitrogen), 190 ng/μl mouse Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen). Immediately before hybridization, the probes were denatured for 1 min 30 s at 95 °C and then rapidly applied onto the microarray under a coverslip. The hybridization reaction was performed for 14–16 h at 64 °C in a hybridization cassette (Telechem International). Slides were washed with buffer of decreasing ionic strength to remove non-specifically bound DNA and then dried by centrifugation. Microarrays Scanning and Normalization—Microarrays were scanned using a scanning laser microscope (ScanArray 4000, GSI Lumonics, Watertown, MA). Separate images were acquired for each fluorophore at a resolution of 10 μm per pixel. For scaling of the two channels with respect to signal intensity, photomultiplier and laser power settings were adjusted to achieve a signal ratio of control genes as close to 1.0 as possible. The spot average fluorescence intensity for each gene and for each fluorophore was measured with the ImaGene software (Biodiscovery Inc., Los Angeles, CA). Data were transformed into log2 intensities ratio (Cy5/Cy3) and normalized with a locally weighted linear regression (Lowess) method. The expression data were filtered based on flag and background intensity criteria (24Cleveland W.S. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1979; 74: 829-836Crossref Scopus (7131) Google Scholar). All these previous steps were performed with the R software for statistical computing available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (cran.us.r-project.org/). cDNA Microarrays Validation and Definition of the Confidence Interval—Spotted microarrays were prepared as described above with cDNAs encoding proteins controlling several metabolic pathways (Table I). We first validated these microarrays using mRNA prepared from control mouse liver (self versus self) and from the liver of fasted and fed mice. Correct normalization of data was verified by visualizing data on M versus A plots and quantile-quantile plots (Supplemental Fig. S1, a and c). The boundaries of a 98% confidence interval were determined to be –0.47 and +0.47, based on log2 gene expression ratios for self versus self experiments as shown on the frequency histograms (Supplemental Fig. S1b). As an additional validation of the microarrays, hybridization experiments were performed with mRNA extracted from fed and fasted mouse livers. Based on the established confidence interval, 131 genes were differentially expressed (Supplemental Fig. S2). Where previous data existed, the regulated expression of these genes was found to correctly reflect their known regulation during the fed to fast transition.Table IList of metabolic pathways and number of genes presentA) Glucose metabolism: 69A1) Glycolysis: 21 genesA2) Krebs cycle: 17A3) Pentose phosphate shunt: 6A4) Gluconeogenesis: 4A5) Glycogen biosynthesis/degradation: 11A6) Transporters, Carriers: 9A7) Others: 1B) Lipid metabolism: 85B1) Activation and β-oxidation of fatty acids (even/odd chain, polyunsaturated): 18B2) Biosynthesis of Triglycerides and Phospholipids: 16B3) Cholesterol metabolism: 29B4) Lipid transport, Lipoproteins, Lipases: 22C) Mitochondrial metabolism: 16D) Proteins involved in insulin secretion and β-cell function: 100D1) Insulin and insulin secretion: 11D2) Glucose signaling: 3D3) Insulin exocytosis: 27D4) Transcription factors: 15D5) Receptors/Ligands: 8D6) Cytokines, Signaling: 36E) Proteins involved in insulin/glucagon action and insulin resistance: 73F) Adipose tissue: 61F1) Adipocyte differentiation factors, transcription factors: 34F2) Adipocyte cytokines/hormones, intracellular signaling: 27G) Hypothalamus: 52Peptides and peptide receptorsH) Pancreatic development: 106I) Ribosomal genes: 7K) Miscellanous: 85 Open table in a new tab Analysis of Gene Expression in the Liver of LnD, LD, and ObD Mice and Statistics—The median value of six hybridizations was determined for each gene. After 10,000 bootstraps of the median values, the distributions of the 1st and of the 99th percentiles were determined. The mean of each percentile distribution was used as limits of the 98% confidence interval. The whole procedure was done with the R software. The BRB-Array Tools software (Biometric Research Branch of the NCI, National Institutes of Health) was used for supervised analysis. A leave-one-out cross-validation procedure was performed with 297 genes and (21-1) mice for liver or 203 genes and (18-1) mice for muscle to generate prediction models in defining classifiers containing genes that best discriminate between the ObD, LD, and LnD phenotypes, between the diabetic and non-diabetic phenotypes or between the obese and lean phenotypes. For each iteration of the leave-one-out cross-validation, one mouse was left out, and genes were selected using an univariate t- (for two groups comparison) or ANOVA F-test (for more than two groups comparison) with a specific p value (<0.005 or <0.01 depending on the group comparison). The permutation distribution of the t-or F statistic, based on 2000 random permutations, was used to confirm statistical significance. The discrimination power of the classifier was evaluated using the supervised k-nearest neighbor method (with k = 1), which consists in predicting the group label of a new mouse based on the label of its nearest neighbors positioned in a space of n dimensions (n corresponding to the number of genes present in the classifier). The metric used was the Euclidian distance. The whole procedure was repeated until all mice had been left out once. The overall performance of the classifier was measured by calculating the classification rate following the entire cross-validation procedure. The probability of obtaining a high classification rate by chance was determined by repeating the entire cross-validation procedure using 2000 random permutations of the group labels of mice. The proposed final classifiers (Table S4) are lists of genes selected with a t- or ANOVA F-tests, using p value cutoff used for the leave-one-out cross-validation, applied on all liver (21 mice) or muscle tissues (18 mice). The correlation between the expression values of a given gene and the AUC index was assessed by univariate least square linear regression, using the lm function of the “base package” of the R language. The t statistic for the hypothesis that the regression coefficient was equal to zero and its p value were computed for every gene. Genes having a p value < 0.0075 were selected for the classification procedure. The class discrimination power of this gene selection method was tested by a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure using the k-nearest neighbor method as previously described. p values for the significance of the deviation from independence between true and predicted labels were obtained with the Fisher exact test (ctest package for R) and with the alternative hypothesis set to “greater.” The multidimensional scaling (MDS) method projects the data points from a high dimensional space to a low dimensional space (two or three dimensions), in a way that best preserves their relative distance. MDS was performed with the expression values of genes present in classifiers generated by the F- or t-tests or the linear regression method. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to confirm the expression levels of some genes obtained by cDNA microarrays. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 μg of total RNA using Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) primed with 50 pmol of random hexamers. Reactions without reverse transcriptase served as a control for amplification of genomic DNA. The reactions were carried out in a 20-μl volume in Lithos qPCR Mastermix containing 1× SYBR Green (Eurogentec) with cDNA template from 250 ng of total RNA and 10 pmol of specific primers. The list of the primers is available in Table S5 of the Supplemental Materials. Quantitative PCR was carried out using the LightCycler System (Roche Diagnostics). For each sample, duplicate amplification measurements are presented as average. Measurements of Plasma Lipid Concentrations—Total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein and triglycerides plasma concentrations were determined using enzymatic colorimetric assays produced by Biomérieux (France) on a Cobas Mira Plus analyzer from Roche Applied Science. VLDL levels were calculated by subtracting the high density lipoprotein value from the total cholesterol value. Gene Expression in Liver of High Fat Fed Mice—To evaluate the pattern of “metabolic” gene expression in tissues from mice displaying differential metabolic adaptation at 9 months of high fat feeding, we isolated mRNA from the experimental groups and used mRNA from mice fed a normal chow (NC) for 9 months. In a first set of experiments, microarray analysis were performed with independent liver mRNA preparations obtained from each group (7 for ObD, 6 for LD, and 8 for LnD) and compared with a pool of mRNA isolated from the liver of 10 NC mice. The characteristics of the mice used are presented in Table II. The complete list of genes whose expression was significantly regulated in the different groups of mice is presented in Supplemental Table S1. A summary of these data is presented in Table III. These data show that a set of genes was similarly regulated in all three groups but that each subgroup presented additional specific gene expression patterns.Table IIBody weights, basal blood glycemia, and area under the curve of 9-month ObD, LD, LnD, and NC miceGroupBWaAUC, area under the curve was determined after an intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test; BW, body weight; NC, normal chow.

Open table in a new tab Genes Similarly Regulated in All Groups—These genes and their encoded proteins belonged to different metabolic pathways where they play important regulatory roles. Glucose-6-phosphate translocase (gluconeogenesis) was reduced; CPT-1 (β-oxidation) was increased as were UCP-2 (mitochondrial uncoupling) and lactate dehydrogenase (production of lactate from pyruvate). Genes Specifically Regulated in Each Group—In the ObD mice, there was a coordinated up-regulation of eight genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, including two involved in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and an increase in the fatty acid translocator CD36. These changes were correlated with an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α expression, a known transcriptional up-regulator of fatty acid oxidation in liver. There was also a reduction in the cholesterol biosynthesis genes as compared with the other groups. Interestingly, these regulated genes are known target genes of the transcriptional activator of cholesterol biosynthesis, sterol regulatory clement-binding protein 2 (25Sakakura Y. Shimano H. Sone H.

In both groups of lean mice, there was a coordinate reduction in the expression of one key glycolytic gene (l-pyruvate kinase) and four genes of fatty acid synthesis: malic enzyme, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Scd-1), and Spot 14 (THIH).

https://openalex.org/W2059542103,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the gynecological disease with the highest death rate. We applied an automatic class discovery procedure based on gene expression profiling to stages III-IV tumors to search for molecular signatures associated with the biological properties and progression of EOC. Using a complementary DNA microarray containing 4451 cancer-related, sequence-verified features, we identified a subset of EOC characterized by the expression of numerous genes related to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its remodeling, along with elements of the fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) signaling pathway. A total of 10 genes were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and coexpression of FGF2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 in tumor cells was revealed by immunohistochemistry, confirming the reliability of gene expression by cDNA microarray. Since the functional relationships among these genes clearly suggested involvement of the identified molecular signature in processes related to epithelial-stromal interactions and/or epithelial-mesenchymal cellular plasticity, we applied supervised learning analysis on ovarian-derived cell lines showing distinct cellular phenotypes in culture. This procedure enabled construction of a gene classifier able to discriminate mesenchymal-like from epithelial-like cells. Genes overexpressed in mesenchymal-like cells proved to match the FGF2 signaling and ECM molecular signature, as identified by unsupervised class discovery on advanced tumor samples. In vitro functional analysis of the cell plasticity classifier was carried out using two isogenic and immortalized cell lines derived from ovarian surface epithelium and displaying mesenchymal and epithelial morphology, respectively. The results indicated the autocrine, but not intracrine stimulation of mesenchymal conversion and cohort/scatter migration of cells by FGF2, suggesting a central role for FGF2 signaling in the maintenance of cellular plasticity of ovary-derived cells throughout the carcinogenesis process. These findings raise mechanistic hypotheses on EOC pathogenesis and progression that might provide a rational underpinning for new therapeutic modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2088726624,"The Cdk inhibitor p21 regulates p53-mediated growth arrest following DNA damage. It is expressed during epithelial differentiation in a variety of organs including colon. We investigated susceptibility of p21-deficient mice to the colon carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM). After AOM injections, rodents develop putative premalignant lesions called aberrant crypt foci (ACF) that are localized to the distal three centimeters of the colon. p21-deficient mice developed significantly higher numbers of ACF than wild-type mice in response to AOM, and these were not restricted to distal colon. After AOM treatment, increased numbers of lymphoid aggregates were detected in p21-deficient colon. Proliferation was similar in wild type and p21-deficient colon before and after AOM injection, but AOM-induced apoptosis was detected only in wild-type crypt epithelial cells, and not in the p21-deficient colon. The proapoptotic function uncovered for p21 was unexpected, because p21 acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis in many systems, and is not required for p53-dependent apoptosis. Enhanced formation of ACF in p21-deficient mice supports a tumor suppressor function for p21 in the colon. Reduced apoptosis of colon epithelial cells with deleterious mutations may be an initiating event in the formation of ACF, with inflammatory cell cytokine expression contributing to their further expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2038203729,"The protein quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ensures that only properly folded proteins are deployed throughout the cells. When nonnative proteins accumulate in the ER, the unfolded protein response is triggered to limit further accumulation of nonnative proteins and the ER is cleared of accumulated nonnative proteins by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In the yeast ER, aberrant nonnative proteins are mainly directed for the ERAD, but a distinct fraction of them instead receive O-mannosylation. In order to test whether O-mannosylation might also be a mechanism to process aberrant proteins in the ER, here we analyzed the effect of O-mannosylation on two kinds of model aberrant proteins, a series of N-glycosylation site mutants of prepro-α-factor and a pro-region-deleted derivative of Rhizopus niveus aspartic proteinase-I (Δpro) both in vitro and in vivo. O-Mannosylation increases solubilities of the aberrant proteins and renders them less dependent on the ER chaperone, BiP, for being soluble. The release from ER chaperones allows the aberrant proteins to exit out of the ER for the normal secretory pathway transport. When the gene for Pmt2p, responsible for the O-mannosylation of these aberrant proteins, and that for the ERAD were simultaneously deleted, the cell exhibited enhanced unfolded protein response.

Nascent secretory and membrane proteins translocating into the ER undergo folding, oligomerization, and maturation, including glycosylation and disulfide bridge formation, with the aid of molecular chaperones and folding enzymes. Quality control mechanisms in the ER monitor these processes to ensure that defective proteins that failed to acquire correct functional structures are not deployed throughout the cells (1Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Aberrant proteins are continuously exposed to chaperones and folding enzymes to achieve their native conformations. If this protein repair is not successful, aberrant proteins are cleared from the ER by a mechanism called ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (2Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A.

Nonnative proteins have such features as the exposure of hydrophobic regions, exposed free cysteines, and the tendency to aggregate. These features are readily recognized by the ER chaperones and folding enzymes including molecular chaperones of the Hsp70 family, calnexin/calreticulin, and thiol oxidoreducatases of the protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) family (4Fewell S.W.

In the ER of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, BiP, an ER member of the Hsp70 family, facilitates folding and assembly of nonnative proteins by preventing their aggregate formation, in cooperation with its partner proteins Jem1p and Scj1p (5Nishikawa S.

Interactions of nonnative proteins with these ER chaperones and folding enzymes during the “chaperone-mediated folding process” may well contribute to the block of their deployment out of the ER (1Ellgaard L.

Both correctly folded proteins and nonnative proteins with N-linked glycans receive trimming of glucose by glucosidases in the ER lumen. If glycoproteins cannot acquire native conformations within an appropriate time window, they are targeted to the ERAD pathway for disposal (7Helenius A. Aebi M.

Trimming of terminal mannose by mannosidase I is a slow process, so that it regulates the protein flux for the ERAD pathway. PDI was shown to be responsible for directing nonnative proteins to the ERAD pathway in yeast (12Gillece P. Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. de la Cruz F.J. Römisch K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1443-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Nonnative proteins that enter the ERAD pathway are not degraded in the ER lumen but instead translocated back to the cytosol for degradation (13Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). BiP, a yeast ER member of the Hsp70 family, in cooperation with its partner proteins Jem1p and Scj1p facilitates the ERAD process by preventing aggregation of misfolded proteins prior to the retrotranslocation (5Nishikawa S. Fewell S.W. Kato Y. Brodsky J.L. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The retrotranslocation of proteins across the ER membrane to the cytosol is mediated by the Sec61 translocon channel, the same translocon used for import (13Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), and/or Derlin-1 (Der1p in yeast) (14Liley B.N. Ploegh H.L.

Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) with the aid of such cytosolic components as the AAA ATPase, Cdc48, and its partner proteins (16Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Most of the ERAD substrates are ubiquitinated in the cytosol and are finally degraded by the 26 S proteasome (13Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In parallel with the ERAD process, accumulation of nonnative proteins in the ER leads to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which induces transcription of genes encoding a set of proteins that can process aberrant proteins, and translational attenuation to reduce the amount of proteins imported newly into the ER (17Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In addition to N-linked glycochains, O-linked carbohydrate chains are attached to proteins in the ER (18Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In yeast, O-linked glycosylation starts by the addition of the initial mannose from dolichol-phosphate mannose to Ser/Thr by one of the seven O-mannosyl transferases (Pmt1–7p), although no consensus amino acid sequence was identified as an O-mannosylation site. Roles of O-mannosylation in the protein secretion (18Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have been suggested. Recently, several aberrant proteins were found to receive O-mannosylation in the yeast ER; when N-glycosylation site mutants of prepro-α-factor (ppαF) were translocated into isolated yeast microsomes, subsequent incubation with cytosol led to O-mannosylation of imported and cleaved pro-α-factor (pαF) (23Harty C. Strahl S. Römisch K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor received O-mannosylation if artificially retained in the ER (24Coughlan C.M. Walker J.L. Cochran J.C. Wittrup K.D. Brodsky J.L J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15289-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). KHN (Kar2-hemagglutinin neuraminidase) also received O-mannosylation during its degradation by the ERAD pathway (25Vashist S. Kim W. Belden W.J. Spear E.D. Barlowe C. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of O-mannosylation of aberrant proteins remains unclear. Although bulky hydrophilic N-linked glycans could increase solubilities of glycoproteins and suppress their irreversible aggregation (26Schülke N. Schmid F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8832-8837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wojczyk B.S. Stwora-Wojczyk M. Shakin-Eshleman S. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L.

J. 1998; 332: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), few studies have been carried out to test whether O-linked glycans have similar properties. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of O-mannosylation on distinct model aberrant proteins: a series of N-glycosylation site mutants of prepro-α-factor and a pro-region-deleted derivative of Rhizopus niveus aspartic proteinase I (Δpro). We found that O-mannosylated pαF mutants and Δpro became soluble and partly secreted out of the cell through the normal secretory pathway. O-Mannosylation rendered pαF mutants less dependent on the ER chaperone, BiP, for being soluble. The impairment of O-mannosylation, especially with that of the ERAD, led to the enhanced UPR. Thus, we propose a new model in which O-mannosylation reduces the load for ER chaperones to contribute to the maintenance of ER homeostasis.

Plasmids encoding p(NNN)pαF, p(NQQ)pαF, and p(QQQ)pαF for a halo assay were constructed as follows. A genomic clone containing the MFα1-coding sequence was cut with EcoRI, and the resultant 1.8-kb EcoRI fragment was inserted into the EcoRI site of pUC18 to give pUCMFα1NNN. For construction of pUCMFα1QQQ, a 0.47-kb fragment was amplified by PCR using pGem2αF3Q as a template and using primers 5′-CAG ACT ACA ACA GAA GAT GAA A-3′ and 5′-GCG GTC GAC TTT GTT ACA TCT ACA CTG-3′ and cut with SalI. The resultant 0.47-kb fragment was introduced into HincII-SalI sites of pUCMFα1NNN. For constructing pUCMFα1NQQ, pGem2αFNQQ was cut with SalI and subsequently with HincII, and the resultant 0.47-kb HincII-SalI fragment was introduced into the HincII-SalI site of pUCMFα1NNN. Inserts containing the promoter region and the open reading frame of p(NNN)pαF, p(NQQ)pαF, or p(QQQ)pαF was introduced into pRS316 (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

Cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, and 2% glucose), YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, and 2% galactose), SCGal (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% galactose, 0.5% casamino acids), SCD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids), and SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2% glucose) In Vitro Translocation of pαF Mutants and Δpro into Yeast Microsomes and ERAD Assay—In vitro translocation into isolated yeast microsomes and ERAD assays of pαF mutants were performed as described (5Nishikawa S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The ATP mix contains 40 mm creatine phosphate, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 1 mm ATP, 50 μm GDP-mannose (GDPMan). In order to detect a [14C]mannose-labeled form of ΔG(QQQ)pαF, nonlabeled ΔG(QQQ)pαF-loaded membranes were incubated with ATP mix and the yeast cytosol in the presence of 50 μm [14C]GDPMan instead of cold GDPMan. After incubation, proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ppαF antibodies. In vitro translation and translocation into isolated yeast microsomes of Δpro were performed as above, except that translation and translocation were coupled. Briefly, microsomes were added to the translation reaction mixture 10 min after initiation of the translation at 20 °C and further incubated for 60 min at 20 °C. Δpro-loaded microsomes were collected by centrifugation and subjected to ERAD assays. Proteins bound to ConA-Sepharose were eluted with 1 m α-methylmannoside in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA for 1 h at 30 °C. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and radioimaging with a Storm 860 image analyzer (Amersham Biosciences). Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—Sucrose density gradient centrifugation for proteins in microsomes and yeast cell lysate was performed as in Ref. 5Nishikawa S. Fewell S.W. Kato Y.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8179-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼5 × 105 tester cells (BC180), which are supersensitive to α-factor, were spread onto SCD plates that contained appropriate supplements and were buffered at pH 3.5. Cells to be tested for α-factor production were spotted on the plates with sterile toothpicks. The secreted α-factor was quantified according to the following equation: halo size (mm) = 1.8 ln(amount of α-factor (ng)) + 5.5. 2S. Nishikawa, unpublished results. Pulse-Chase Experiments—Metabolic labeling of yeast cells with Tran35S-label (ICN) and preparation of cell extracts were performed essentially as described (37Nishikawa S. Nakano A. Biochim. Biophys.

Before labeling, Δpro was induced in the minimal medium containing 2% galactose. Immunoprecipitation of Δpro with anti-RNAP-I antibodies and the second round of immunoprecipitation with anti-α1,3-mannose antibodies were performed as described previously (9Nakatsukasa K.

The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with or without 6 m urea and radioimaging. Assay of Cellular β-Galactosidase Activity—UPR induction was measured by using a single copy (CEN) plasmid that harbored the CYC1 promoter containing the UPR element fused to the lacZ gene (pSCZ-Y, a gift from K.

Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Immunofluorescent staining of yeast cells was performed as described previously (40Nishikawa S. Hirata A. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Incubation with primary antibodies was performed as follows: 1:250 dilution of the rabbit anti-BiP polyclonal antibody (41Nishikawa S. Endo T. J. Biol.

Incubation with secondary antibodies was performed as follows: 1:10 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG antibody F(ab′)2 fragment. N-Glycosylation Mutants of Pro-α-factor Receive O-Mannosylation—Prepro-α-factor is the precursor form of a yeast mating pheromone and consists of an ER-targeting signal sequence that is cleaved off in the ER, a pro-region, and four tandem repeats of α-factor peptides, all of which are cleaved in the Golgi complex. Since the pro-region has three potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-23, Asn-57, and Asn-67) (Fig. 1A), we designate it as p(NNN)pαF. p(QQQ)pαF, a mutant form of p(NNN)pαF that has three glutamine residues substituted for the N-glycosyl acceptor sites (Fig. 1A) and therefore receives no N-glycosylation in the ER, has been used as a model aberrant protein for in vitro ERAD assays with yeast microsomes (34McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 43Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 44Lee R.J. Liu C. Harty C. McCracken A.A. Latterich M. Römisch K. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Brodsky J.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Besides, it was reported that a fraction of (QQQ)pαF imported into yeast microsomes in vitro receives O-mannosylation in the ER lumen instead of being retrotraslocated to the cytosol for degradation under the ERAD conditions, although its biological relevance remained unclear (23Harty C. Strahl S. Römisch K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When radiolabeled wild-type p(NNN)pαF and mutant p(QQQ)pαF, synthesized in yeast lysates (pp in Fig. 1B, NNN and QQQ) were incubated with isolated yeast microsomes, they were efficiently translocated into microsomes. p(NNN)pαF received signal sequence cleavage and N-glycosylation to form 3G(NNN)pαF(3Gp in Fig. 1B, NNN) in the ER lumen, whereas p(QQQ)pαF received signal sequence cleavage, but no N-glycosylation and formed ΔG(QQQ)pαF(ΔGp in Fig. 1B, QQQ), since it lacked all of the N-glycosyl acceptor sites. The microsomes were then washed and incubated with the yeast cytosol fraction and “ATP mix” (the ERAD conditions; see “Experimental Procedures”). The amount of 3G(NNN)pαF remained the same even after 60 min incubation with the cytosol. On the other hand, the amount of ΔG(QQQ)pαF decreased, but a smeared band (asterisk in Fig. 1B, QQQ) concomitantly appeared above the band for ΔG(QQQ)pαF and shifted upward with increasing time of incubation, which appeared to reflect O-mannosylation (23Harty C. Strahl S. Römisch K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ΔG(QQQ)pαF species responsible for the smeared band was precipitated with ConA-Sepharose beads (mΔGp in Fig. 1C, lane 2) and even after treatment with endoglycosidase H, which removes N-linked glycans (mΔGp in Fig. 1C, lane 4). When nonlabeled p(QQQ)pαF, instead of radiolabeled p(QQQ)pαF, was translocated into the microsomes and subsequently incubated with the cytosol and ATP mix in the presence of [14C]GDPMan, a [14C]mannose-labeled form of ΔG(QQQ)pαF was detected by radioimaging after immunoprecipitation with anti-ppαF antibodies (mΔGp in Fig. 1D). This confirms that mannose was transferred to ΔG(QQQ)pαF from GDPMan as a donor. Since ΔG(QQQ)pαF received O-mannosylation whereas 3G(NNN)pαF did not, we tried to assess the relationship between the number of N-glycosylated moieties and the extent of O-mannosylation on pαF derivatives. We thus made a series of p(NNN)pαF mutants in which one or two asparagine residue(s) in the N-glycosyl acceptor sites was converted to glutamine residue(s) (Fig. 1A). p(NNN)pαF mutants with an Asn → Gln substitution at position 67, 57, or 23 are designated as p(NNQ)pαF, p(NQN)pαF, and p(QNN)pαF, respectively, and those with double Asn → Gln substitutions at positions 57 and 67, 23 and 67, or 23 and 57 are designated as p(NQQ)pαF, p(QNQ)pαF, and p(QQN)pαF, respectively. The relative mobilities of signal cleaved and N-glycosylated forms of single glycosylation site mutants (2G(NNQ)pαF, 2G(NQN)pαF, and 2G(QNN)pαF) and double glycosylation site mutants (1G(NQQ)pαF, 1G(QNQ)pαF, and 1G(QQN)pαF) to those of 3G(NNN)pαF and ΔG(QQQ)pαF are consistent with one another (pp in Fig. 1B). The bands for 1G(QNQ)pαF and 1G(QQN)pαF migrated faster than that for 1G(NQQ)pαF (45Caplan S. Green R. Rocco J. Kurjan J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 627-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were overlapped by those for p(QNQ)pαF and p(QQN)pαF (1Gp and pp in Fig. 1B, 0 min of chase of QNQ and QQN). During incubation with the cytosol and ATP mix, 1G(NQQ)pαF, 1G(QNQ)pαF, and 1G(QQN)pαF were partly converted to higher molecular weight forms (asterisk in Fig. 1B, NQQ, QNQ, and QQN), whereas 2G(NNQ)pαF, 2G(NQN)pαF, and 2G(QNN)pαF were not (Fig. 1B). These higher molecular weight forms arose from O-mannosylation, since they were not observed with microsomes prepared from the pmt2Δ strain, which lacks the PMT2 gene, one of the seven PMT genes for mannosyl transferases in yeast (Fig. 1E). O-Mannosylation of double glycosylation site mutants was also confirmed by precipitation with ConA-Sepharose beads after treatment with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 3). Therefore, although 3G(NNN)pαF and the single glycosylation site mutants (2G(NNQ)pαF, 2G(NQN)pαF, and 2G(QNN)pαF) did not receive O-mannosylation, double glycosylation site mutants (1G(NQQ)pαF, 1G(QNQ)pαF, and 1G(QQN)pαF) and ΔG(QQQ)pαF were significantly O-mannosylated. The O-mannosylated forms were resistant to externally added protease but were degraded by protease upon disruption of the membranes with detergent (data not shown), suggesting tha"
https://openalex.org/W1986141898,"DNA damage initiates signaling events through kinase cascades that result in cell cycle checkpoint control and DNA repair. However, it is not yet clear how the signaling pathways relay to DNA damage repair. Using the repeat region of checkpoint protein MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1), we identified DNA-PKcs/Ku as MDC1-associated proteins. Here, we show that MDC1 directly interacts with the Ku/DNA-PKcs complex. Down-regulation of MDC1 resulted in defective phospho-DNA-PKcs foci formation and DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation, suggesting that MDC1 regulates autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs following DNA damage. Furthermore, DNA-PK-dependent DNA damage repair is defective in cells depleted of MDC1. Taken together, these results suggest that the MDC1 repeat region is involved in protein-protein interaction with DNA-PKcs/Ku, and MDC1 regulates DNA damage repair by influencing DNA-PK autophosphorylation. Therefore, MDC1 acts not only as a mediator of DNA damage checkpoint but also as a mediator of DNA damage repair. DNA damage initiates signaling events through kinase cascades that result in cell cycle checkpoint control and DNA repair. However, it is not yet clear how the signaling pathways relay to DNA damage repair. Using the repeat region of checkpoint protein MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1), we identified DNA-PKcs/Ku as MDC1-associated proteins. Here, we show that MDC1 directly interacts with the Ku/DNA-PKcs complex.

Therefore, MDC1 acts not only as a mediator of DNA damage checkpoint but also as a mediator of DNA damage repair. DNA damage response pathways contain many mediator proteins, such as Rad9, Mrc1, Claspin, and 53BP1, which are important for the integration and amplification of DNA damage signals (1Sancar A.

The formation of MDC1 foci requires H2AX (2Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M.R. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 6Peng A. Chen P.L. J.

In addition, MDC1 regulates the phosphorylation of BRCA1, Chk1, and SMC1 in response to ionizing radiation (2Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M.R. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 5Lou Z.K. Chini C.C.S. Minter-Dykhouse K. Chen J.J. J. Biol.

Similar to other mediator proteins, MDC1 contains several protein-protein interaction domains, such as the FHA domain and the BRCT domain. It is believed that MDC1 functions as an adaptor protein, recruiting downstream proteins to upstream kinases, such as ATM/ATR, and facilitating signal transduction following DNA damage. In addition to the FHA domain and BRCT domain, MDC1 contains 14 repeat sequences (aa 1124–1697), with no apparent homology to other known proteins in the data base. We hypothesized that the repeat region of MDC1 is also involved in protein-protein interaction. Here, we report that this repeat region of MDC1 directly interacts with Ku/DNA-PK, and this interaction is required for efficient DNA-PK autophosphorylation and DNA damage repair. Cells, Constructs, and Antibodies—HeLa cells were purchased from National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). V3.3, V3.155, CHO-K1, and XRS6 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Penny Jeggo. GST-MDC1 repeat was generated by subcloning a fragment of MDC1 cDNA encoding aa 1148–1610 into pGex5X3 vector. Wild-type and deletion mutation (ΔR) of MDC1 were cloned in pcDNA3.1V5His vector (Invitrogen). The sequence of MDC1 siRNA was described previously (4Lou Z. Minter-Dykhouse K. Wu X. Chen J. Nature. 2003; 421: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-MDC1, anti-phospho-Thr2609DNA-PK and anti-γH2AX antibodies were described previously (5Lou Z.K. Chini C.C.S.

Anti-MDC1 monoclonal antibodies were generated by Mayo Antibody Core Facility using standard procedure. Anti-DNA-PK antibodies were purchased from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). Anti-Ku80 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Double Strand Break (DSB) Repair Assay—Cells were twice transfected with control siRNA or MDC1 siRNA as described previously (5Lou Z.K. Chini C.C.S. Minter-Dykhouse K. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13599-13602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 72 h after initial transfection, cells were irradiated (40 Gy) and left to recover for the indicated time. Cells were then trypsinized and resuspended in agarose plugs. The plugs were loaded onto 0.8% agarose gel, and pulse field gel electrophoresis was performed. Random Integration Assay—Cells were transfected twice with control siRNA or MDC1 siRNA as described previously (5Lou Z.K. Chini C.C.S. Minter-Dykhouse K. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13599-13602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). At the time of second siRNA transfection, cells were cotransfected with linearized pIRES-Puro, kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Ward (Mayo Clinic). 24 h later, cells were plated at different densities in media containing puromycin (2 μg/ml), and colony formation was determined 7–10 days later. Microhomology Repair Assay—Cells were transfected twice with control siRNA, DNA-PK siRNA, or MDC1 siRNA as described previously (5Lou Z.K. Chini C.C.S. Minter-Dykhouse K. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13599-13602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Microhomology assay was performed as described previously (10Verkaik N.S. Esveldt-van Lange R.E. van Heemst D. Bruggenwirth H.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. Zdzienicka M.Z. van Gent D.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with the repeat region of MDC1, we used a GST-MDC1 fragment containing most of the repeat sequence (aa 1148–1610) as an affinity matrix to purify proteins that may associate with MDC1. We identified several proteins, especially a protein larger than 250 kDa that specifically interacts with the GST-MDC1 repeat region (GST-MDCR) (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometry and microsequencing revealed this protein as DNA-PKcs, which is the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK. DNA-PKcs and Ku, the regulatory factors that are composed of heterodimer of 70 and 80 kDa, respectively, form catalytically active DNA-PK (11Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Western blot confirmed that GST-MDC1 repeats efficiently pulled down DNA-PKcs and Ku from cell lysates (Fig. 1B). To prove that DNA-PK and MDC1 interact in vivo, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiment. As shown in Fig. 1C, MDC1 coimmunoprecipitated with DNA-PKcs and Ku. No Ku or DNA-PKcs coimmunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum (NRS) (Fig. 1C) or with anti-53BP1, anti-BRCA1, and anti-Claspin antibodies (data not shown), suggesting the specificity of MDC1-DNA-PKcs/Ku interaction. The interaction of MDC1 and DNA-PKcs/Ku complex is not dependent upon DNA, since ethidium bromide (100 μg/ml) does not affect the coimmunoprecipitation of MDC1 and DNA-PKcs/Ku (data not shown). Furthermore, the interaction of MDC1 and DNA-PKcs/Ku appears to be constitutive, since we did not observe any changes in this interaction before or after DNA damage (data not shown). We next asked whether the repeat region of MDC1 is required for MDC1-Ku interaction in vivo. Constructs encoding V5 tagged wild-type MDC1 or MDC1 containing a deletion of the repeat region (MDC1delR) were expressed in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, the binding of Ku to MDC1delR is significantly decreased when compared with its binding to wild-type MDC1, suggesting that the repeat region of MDC1 is important for its interaction with Ku/DNA-PK in vivo. Because Ku specifically interacts with DNA ends, it is suggested that DNA-PKcs is activated and recruited to DSB through its interaction with the Ku heterodimer (12Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 13Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of DNA-PK activation is not clear. Recent studies suggest that DNA-PKcs undergoes autophosphorylation at multiple sites (9Chan D.W. Chen B.P.C. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1198-1201PubMed Google Scholar), and the autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is important to DSB repair and cell survival following IR (9Chan D.W. Chen B.P.C. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 15Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P.

Furthermore, phospho-DNA-PKcs foci colocalize with γH2AX and 53BP1 foci after DNA damage (9Chan D.W. Chen B.P.C. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylated DNA-PK localizes at the sites of DNA breaks. As expected, MDC1 foci colocalize with phospho-Thr2609-DNA-PKcs (pT2609DNA-PK) foci following IR (Fig. 2A). No pT2609DNA-PK foci were detected in DNA-PK-deficient cell line (Ref. 9Chan D.W. Chen B.P.C. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar and supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting the specificity of the anti-pT2609DNA-PK antibodies. Several lines of evidence suggest that MDC1 foci formation is independent of DNA-PKcs/Ku. A previous study has shown that DNA-PKcs is not required for MDC1 foci formation following IR (3Goldberg M. Stucki M. Falck J. D'Amours D. Rahman D. Pappin D. Bartek J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 421: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We also observed normal MDC1 and γH2AX foci formation in DNA-PK-deficient cells (data not shown). In addition, we observed normal MDC1 foci formation in Ku-deficient Xrs6 cells (data not shown). Interestingly, down-regulation of MDC1 expression using siRNA significantly decreased pT2609DNA-PK foci formation following IR (Fig. 2B). The decreased phospho-DNA-PK foci in MDC1-depleted cells could be caused by defective recruitment of phospho-DNA-PK at the sites of DNA damage or decreased DNA-PK phosphorylation. Therefore, we next examined whether DNA-PKcs phosphorylation requires MDC1. As shown in Fig. 2C, DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr2609, but not DNA-PKcs expression, is decreased in cells transfected with MDC1 siRNA. We also detected decreased DNA-PK phosphorylation at Ser2056 site, another damage-induced phosphorylation site on DNA-PK (data not shown). However, DNA-PK kinase activity was not affected by the depletion of MDC1 (supplementary Fig. S2). Taken together, these results suggest that MDC1 regulates DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation following IR. Many genetic and biochemical studies have established an essential role of DNA-PK in DSB repair (17Jackson S.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is important for DSB repair and cell survival in response to ionizing radiation (9Chan D.W. Chen B.P.C. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 15Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 16Soubeyrand S. Pope L. Pakuts B. Hache R.J.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1198-1201PubMed Google Scholar). Since MDC1 regulates DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation, it is possible that MDC1 regulates DNA-PK-dependent DSB repair. We performed pulse field gel electrophoresis to assay the kinetics of DSB repair in cells transfected with control siRNA or MDC1 siRNA. We observed a mild defect in DSB repair in MDC1 siRNA-transfected cells (supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that MDC1 is not essential for overall DSB joining but is instead involved in certain aspects of DNA end-joining. To investigate whether MDC1 is involved in error-free end-joining mediated by DNA-PK, we used a previously established plasmid-based end-joining assay for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (10Verkaik N.S. Esveldt-van Lange R.E. van Heemst D. Bruggenwirth H.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. Zdzienicka M.Z. van Gent D.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this assay, linearized pDVG94 plasmid was used to transfect cells. If cells are defective in direct error-free end-joining, an alternative microhomology-based joining will be used, therefore creating a BstXI site. In cells that contain mutations of DNA-PK, Ku, XRCC4, or DNA ligase IV, a dramatic increase in the alternative microhomology-based joining has been observed (10Verkaik N.S. Esveldt-van Lange R.E. van Heemst D. Bruggenwirth H.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. Zdzienicka M.Z. van Gent D.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), suggesting the specific requirement of Ku/DNA-PK in an error-free end-joining repair pathway. As shown in Fig. 3A, in MDC1 siRNA transfected cells, significantly more end-joining occurred using the alternative pathway, similar to the cells transfected with DNA-PK siRNA or that in DNA-PK–/– cells (V3) (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that MDC1 is involved in DNA-PKcs/Ku dependent error-free end-joining. The repair defect observed in cells transfected with MDC1 siRNA is not due to any change in cell cycle progression, since we do not observed any detectable difference in cell cycle profile with or without MDC1 siRNA treatment (data not shown). To further confirm our observations, we next used random plasmid integration assay, another assay for DNA-PK-dependent end-joining activity (18Smith-Ravin J. Jeggo P.A. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1989; 56: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19Harrington J. Hsieh C.L. Gerton J. Bosma G. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4758-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Linearized DNA with selection marker is used to transfect cells, and the efficiency of random chromosomal integration of the plasmid DNA is measured by colony formation in selection media. Consistent with previous findings (18Smith-Ravin J. Jeggo P.A. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1989; 56: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19Harrington J. Hsieh C.L. Gerton J. Bosma G. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4758-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the integration frequency of the puromycin-resistant gene is significantly lower in DNA-PK-deficient cells than that observed in the wild-type parental cell line (Fig. 3B). Knock-down MDC1 using siRNA resulted in a significant decrease of integration frequency in DNA-PK-proficient cells but only a minor reduction in DNA-PK-deficient cells (Fig. 3B). The integration frequency was also significantly lower in HeLa cells transfected with MDC1 siRNA or DNA-PKcs siRNA, compared with that in cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results suggest a role of MDC1 in DNA-PK-dependent DSB repair. Since MDC1 has multiple binding partners, depletion of MDC1 might have an indirect effect on DSB repair. To demonstrate that the interaction between DNA-PKcs/Ku and MDC1 is important for DNA-PKcs phosphorylation and DNA end-joining, we generated constructs encoding siRNA-resistant full-length MDC1 (MDC1*) and MDC1 with deleted repeat region (MDC1delR*). Reconstituting MDC1 knock-down cells with full-length (MDC1*), but not deletion mutation of MDC1 (MDC1delR*), restored pT2609DNA-PK foci formation, suggesting that the interaction of MDC1 and DNA-PKcs/Ku is important for DNA-PK phosphorylation (supplementary Fig. S4). Consistent with DNA-PK phosphorylation, reconstitution of full-length MDC1 re-established normal DSB joining (Fig. 3D) and plasmid integration (Fig. 3E), while reconstitution of MDC1delR* failed to do so. As a control, we evaluated NBS1 foci formation in cells reconstituted with MDC1* or MDC1delR*. In agreement with an early study suggesting that NBS1 interacts with MDC1 FHA domain (3Goldberg M. Stucki M. Falck J. D'Amours D. Rahman D. Pappin D. Bartek J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 421: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), reconstitution of either full-length MDC1* or MDC1delR* restored NBS1 foci formation in response to IR (supplementary Fig. S5). Furthermore, reconstitution of either full-length MDC1* or MDC1delR* restored the intra-S checkpoint in response to IR (data not shown), suggesting that MDC1delR* has intact checkpoint function. These data support that the specific interaction between MDC1 and DNA-PKcs/Ku plays an important role in DNA end-joining. We report here that in addition to the FHA and BRCT domain, the repeat region of MDC1 is involved in protein-protein interactions. It directly binds Ku and regulates DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation. Previously, DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation has been shown to be Ku-dependent, presumably facilitated by oligomerization of DNA-PKcs/Ku at DNA ends (9Chan D.W. Chen B.P.C. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Currently, we could not evaluate the effect of MDC1 on the recruitment of DNA-PKcs/Ku to DNA ends, since we have not been able to detect DNA-PKcs or Ku foci formation in response to IR nor could we detect increased binding of DNA-Pkcs/Ku on chromatin (data not shown). Since Ku binds DNA ends with very high affinity, we speculate that MDC1 may not be required for initial binding of Ku and DNA-PKcs to DNA ends. Instead, MDC1 might help the oligomerization and stabilization of DNA-PKcs/Ku complexes at the sites of DNA damage. A similar role for MDC1 has been suggested for the sustained binding of NBS1/MRE11/Rad50 to DNA ends (20Lukas C. Melander F. Stucki M. Falck J. Bekker-Jensen S. Goldberg M. Lerenthal Y. Jackson S.P. Bartek J. Lukas J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). An emerging theme in DNA damage signaling is that mediators such as NBS1 and MDC1 are important for ATM phosphorylation and activation by facilitating the concentration of ATM at the sites of DNA damage (21Uziel T. Lerenthal Y. Moyal L. Andegeko Y. Mittelman L. Shiloh Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 22Carson C.T. Schwartz R.A. Stracker T.H. Lilley C.E. Lee D.V. Weitzman M.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6610-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 23Mochan T.A. Venere M. DiTullio Jr., R.A. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8586-8591PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that MDC1 may play a similar role in regulating the autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs following DNA damage. DNA-PKcs phosphorylation is important for DSB repair (9Chan D.W. Chen B.P.C. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 15Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 16Soubeyrand S. Pope L. Pakuts B. Hache R.J.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1198-1201PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation sites affects cell survival following radiation and also error-free end-joining. However, DNA-PKcs with mutations at these phosphorylation sites could still support DNA end-joining using an alternative pathway that leads to mutations and deletions (15Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 16Soubeyrand S. Pope L. Pakuts B. Hache R.J.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1198-1201PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, cells depleted of MDC1 show a mild defect in overall DSB joining when analyzed by pulse field gel electrophoresis, suggesting that overall DSB joining activity does not require MDC1. Interestingly, cells depleted of MDC1 show significant decrease in the frequency of plasmid integration into chromosomes (Fig. 3C), which has been shown to be dependent on DNA-PK (18Smith-Ravin J. Jeggo P.A. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1989; 56: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19Harrington J. Hsieh C.L. Gerton J. Bosma G. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4758-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, using a plasmid-based assay, we show that cells depleted of MDC1 often use alternation error-prone pathway to repair DSBs (Fig. 3A), suggesting that MDC1 is involved in a DNA-PK-mediated error-free end-joining pathway. In summary, we have shown for the first time that the repeat region of MDC1 is a protein-protein interaction domain and binds directly to Ku/DNA-PK. We also demonstrate that MDC1 is critical for the efficient IR-induced autophosphorylation of DNA-PK, which in turn facilitates DSB repair. These data suggest that in addition to be a mediator of DNA damage checkpoint, MDC1 also contributes to DNA damage repair.

https://openalex.org/W1997890715,"We recently isolated the r-PTPeta gene, which encodes a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase protein that suppresses the neoplastic phenotype of retrovirally transformed rat thyroid cells. The human homologue gene PTPRJ/DEP-1 is deleted in various tumors. Moreover, the Gln276Pro polymorphism, located in the extracellular region of the gene, seems to play a critical role in susceptibility to some human neoplasias. Here we report the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of PTPRJ in 11/76 (14.5%) informative thyroid tumors (including adenomas and carcinomas). We also looked for the Gln276Pro, Arg326Gln and Asp872Glu polymorphisms in exons 5, 6 and 13 of PTPRJ in 88 patients with thyroid tumors and in 54 healthy individuals. We found that the PTPRJ genotypes homozygous for the Gln276Pro and Arg326Gln polymorphisms, and the Asp872 allele were more frequent in thyroid carcinoma patients than in healthy individuals (P=0.032). In addition, PTPRJ LOH was more frequent in thyroid carcinomas of heterozygotes for Gln276Pro and Arg326Gln compared with homozygotes (P=0.006). This suggests that the presence of hemizygosity for these polymorphisms in the tumor facilitates tumor progression. These results indicate that the genotypic profile of PTPRJ affects susceptibility to thyroid carcinomas, and that allelic loss of this gene is involved in thyroid carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1980748010,"BTG2, a p53-inducible antiproliferative gene, is stimulated in breast cancer cells by activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). In rat mammary glands, BTG2 is expressed in epithelial cells and levels decreased during pregnancy and lactation but recovered during involution. Estrogen and progestin suppress BTG2 expression, suggesting that these steroids, which stimulate proliferation and lobuloalveolar development of mammary epithelial cells, may downregulate BTG2 in the mammary gland during pregnancy. Consistent with the report that BTG2 inhibits cyclin D1 expression, suppression of BTG2 mRNA in the mammary gland during gestation, and by estrogen and progestin, correlated with stimulation of cyclin D1. Ectopic expression of BTG2 inhibited breast cancer cell growth by arresting cells in the G1 phase, an effect reversed by cyclin D1. BTG2 expression was very low or undetectable in human breast cancer cell lines compared with nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells, and nuclear expression of BTG2 was absent in 65% of human breast tumors compared with adjacent matched normal glands. Spontaneous mammary tumors arising in a mouse model with targeted expression of the early region of the SV40 large tumor Ag demonstrated loss of BTG2 protein very early during the tumorigenic process. Thus deregulation of BTG2 may be an important step in the development of mammary tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2060300899,"In vitro, protein disulfide isomerase (Pdi1p) introduces disulfides into proteins (oxidase activity) and provides quality control by catalyzing the rearrangement of incorrect disulfides (isomerase activity). Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is an essential protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but the contributions of the catalytic activities of PDI to oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are unclear. Using variants of Pdi1p with impaired oxidase or isomerase activity, we show that isomerase-deficient mutants of PDI support wild-type growth even in a strain in which all of the PDI homologues of the yeast ER have been deleted. Although the oxidase activity of PDI is sufficient for wild-type growth, pulse-chase experiments monitoring the maturation of carboxypeptidase Y reveal that oxidative folding is greatly compromised in mutants that are defective in isomerase activity. Pdi1p and one or more of its ER homologues (Mpd1p, Mpd2p, Eug1p, Eps1p) are required for efficient carboxypeptidase Y maturation. Consistent with its function as a disulfide isomerase in vivo, the active sites of Pdi1p are partially reduced (32 ± 8%) in vivo. These results suggest that PDI and its ER homologues contribute both oxidase and isomerase activities to the yeast ER. The isomerase activity of PDI can be compromised without affecting growth and viability, implying that yeast proteins that are essential under laboratory conditions may not require efficient disulfide isomerization."

https://openalex.org/W1974181284,"Here we have investigated the role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling in the process of vasculogenesis in the mouse embryo. At stages preceding the formation of blood vessels (7.5–8 dpc) in the embryo proper, yolk sac, and allantois, the S1P receptor S1P2 is expressed in conjunction with S1P1 and/or S1P3. Additionally, sphingosine kinase-2 (SK2), an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of S1P, is expressed in these tissues throughout periods of vasculogenesis. Using the cultured mouse allantois explant model of blood vessel formation, we found that vasculogenesis was dependent on S1P signaling. We showed that S1P could replace the ability of serum to promote vasculogenesis in cultured allantois explants. Instead of small poorly reticulated clusters of rounded endothelial cells that formed under serum-free conditions, S1P promoted the formation of elongated endothelial cells that arranged into expansive branched networks of capillary-like vessels. These effects could not be reproduced by vascular endothelial growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor administration. The ability of S1P to promote blood vessel formation was not due to effects on cell survival or on changes in numbers of endothelial cells (Flk1+/PECAM+), angioblasts (Flk1+/PECAM-), or undifferentiated mesodermal cells (Flk1-/PECAM-). The S1P effect on blood vessel formation was attributed to it promoting migratory activities of angioblasts and early endothelial cells required for the expansion of vascular networks. Together, our findings suggest that migratory events critical to the de novo formation of blood vessels are under the influence of S1P, possibly synthesized via the action of SK2, with signaling mediated by S1P receptors that include S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3.

S1P signaling is mediated by a family of G protein-coupled receptors, of which the prototypical member of the family is S1P1 (1Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). S1P1 was initially described as a protein whose expression was up-regulated during endothelial cell differentiation and angiogenesis (2Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent to the identification of S1P1, four other structurally similar proteins (i.e. S1P2–S1P5) were identified as S1P receptors (3An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J.

S1P1 couples stringently to the Gi family of heterotrimeric G proteins (e.g. Gi,Gi1,Gi3,Go, and Gz), whereas S1P2 and S1P3 couple to the Gi, Gq, and G13 G protein families (7Windh R.T. Lee M.J.

In endothelial cells, multiple interconnected S1P signaling pathways have been described that work through S1P1 and S1P3 to induce morphogenesis (i.e. in vitro capillary network formation) (8Lee M.J.

Furthermore, S1P binding to S1P1 induces signaling through Gi and in turn activates Ras, ERK-2, and a cell survival pathway (8Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). S1P1 can also act through an unknown G protein to activate Rac and stimulate cortical actin formation, activate Rho, and as a result stimulate the formation of stress fibers and the assembly of adherens junctions (8Lee M.J.

Alternatively, S1P binding to S1P3 can induce signaling through G13 or Gq to activate Rho and thus promote the formation of stress fibers and adherens junctions (8Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P.

S1P2 can also activate adenylate cyclase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases via an unknown mechanism (11Gonda K. Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yatomi Y. Okazaki H. Sakurai T.

Considerable evidence exists to indicate that S1P signaling influences an array of vascular cell behaviors. For instance, S1P promotes endothelial cell proliferation (15Lee H. Goetzl E.J. An S. Am.

In addition, the defective vascular maturation observed in mice deficient in the S1P receptor, S1P1, highlights a fundamental role for S1P signaling associated with smooth muscle cell investment of nascent vessels (20Liu Y. Wada R. Yamashita T. Mi Y. Deng C.X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Nava V.E. Chae S.S. Lee M.J. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Clin.

Revel J.P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Whereas the collective data support a role for S1P signaling in angiogenic and maturation phases of neovascularization, little is known as to whether S1P signaling is important for vasculogenesis, the process of de novo formation of blood vessels from mesodermal progenitor cells. Herein, we establish that S1P receptors and sphingosine kinase are expressed in prevascularized embryonic tissues and throughout the stages of vasculogenesis, thus supporting a role for S1P signaling in de novo blood vessel formation. Furthermore, using the murine allantois explant culture model of vasculogenesis (22Argraves W.S. Larue A.C. Fleming P.A. Drake C.J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) we demonstrated a requirement for S1P signaling in vasculogenesis.

Donkey anti-rat IgG conjugated to either fluorescein isothiocyanate or indodicarbocyanine was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Recombinant human VEGF165 (VEGF) and bovine basic FGF-2 (bFGF-2) were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). d-erythro-Sphingosine-1-phosphate and d-erythro-sphingosine were provided by the MUSC Lipidomics Core (Department of Biochemistry, MUSC, Charleston, SC). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA, chain 18:1; oleoyl acyl group) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Reverse Transcription and PCR of RNA Isolated from Mouse Embryos, Yolk Sacs, and Allantoides—Embryos (7.5–9.5 days post coitum (dpc)) were removed from timed pregnant CD1 mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) and placed into 4 °C Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS, Cellgro, Herndon, VA). Yolk sacs and allantoides were dissected away from embryos, and each was placed into RNA Later (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Total RNA was extracted using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test, Inc.) from 110 7.5–8.0 dpc allantoides, 50 8–8.4 dpc allantoides, 130 8.5–9.0 dpc allantoides, 30 9.5–10.0 allantoides, 60 7.8–8.0 dpc yolk sacs, 15 8–8.4 dpc yolk sacs, 30 8.5–9.0 dpc yolk sacs, 30 9.5–10.0 dpc yolk sacs, 60 7.8–8.0 dpc embryos, 15 8–8.4 dpc embryos, 30 8.5–9.0 dpc embryos, and 30 9.5–10.0 dpc embryos (all of embryos were free of extraembryonic membranes). Reverse transcription of total mRNA using random hexamer oligodeoxynucleotide primers and cDNA synthesis was performed using a SuperScript First-Strand synthesis System from Invitrogen. cDNAs were diluted 1:5 with deionized water, and 1-μl aliquots were used as template in PCR with TrueFidelity DNA polymerase (0.08 units/μl, Continental Laboratory Products, San Diego, CA), dNTPs (400 μm each, Invitrogen), primers (0.4 μm each), and 1× TrueFidelity PCR buffer with MgCl2 (0.8 mm) in total reaction volumes of 25 μl.

Larue A.C. Fleming P.A. Drake C.J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Embryos (7.5, 7.8, or 8.5 dpc) were dissected from timed pregnant CD1 mice, and the allantoides were dissected away from the embryos and placed into 4 °C dPBS. Allantoides were placed into wells of 4-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) precoated with chicken fibronectin (5 μg/ml) at 4 allantoides/well. Each well contained 0.4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 2% penicillin, streptomycin/l-glutamine (Invitrogen) plus or minus the indicated agents (e.g. 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), S1P, LPA, bFGF (1 μg/ml), or VEGF (1 μg/ml)). Allantois explants were cultured for 18–24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, during which time the cylindrically shaped explants attached and flattened onto the fibronectin-coated glass slide. Immunostaining of Cultured Allantois Explants—Explants were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde by adding 0.8 ml of 3% paraformaldehyde, dPBS, 0.01% sodium azide (dPBSA) (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) to culture medium and incubating for 20 min at room temperature. The fixed explants were washed in dPBSA and then permeabilized in dPBSA, 0.02% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. Permeabilized explants were treated with blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin, dPBSA) and then incubated for 1.5 h with antibodies to PECAM or Flk1, diluted to 20 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin and dPBSA. Fluorochrome-conjugated anti-IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) were added at 10 μg/ml and incubated for 1.5 h. In some cases, explants were also counterstained with either 0.5 ng/ml Hoescht 33342 stain from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) or 5 μm Draq5 (Biostatus Limited, Shepshed, United Kingdom). The antibody-labeled explants were mounted under a number 1 coverslip using anti-bleaching mounting medium. Confocal Microscopy and Image Processing—Immunolabeled allantois explants were examined using either a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser-scanning confocal microscope or a Leica DMR light/epifluorescence microscope equipped with a SPOT-RT Slider camera (Vashaw Scientific, Norcross, GA). For laser-scanning confocal microscope, optical sections of the cultured explants were collected along the Z axis and collapsed into a single focal plane using the manufacturer's software to produce a single virtual image. Adobe Photoshop 7 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) was used to compile montages of images of allantoic explants captured on the Leica DMR microscope and to measure the diameters of mesothelial layers and vascular networks. Flow Cytometry—Allantoides from 8.5 dpc embryos were cultured for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or in this medium containing either 10% serum or 1 μm S1P. Cultured allantois explants were dissociated in 0.5 ml of 1× trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min. Trypsin was inactivated by the addition of 1 ml of serum-containing medium. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 80–100 × g for 10 min and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of serum-containing medium and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min to allow cells to recover. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation as before and resuspended in 300 μl of dPBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% sodium azide, and 10 ng/ml DNase (FACS buffer) and kept on ice for the remainder of the experiment. The cell suspension was filtered through a cell strainer (BD Biosciences), and cells were counted on a hemocytometer. Aliquots (100 μl) of the cells at 1 × 103 cells/μl were incubated with anti-Flk1 IgG conjugated to phycoerythrin and anti-CD31/PECAM IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (each conjugate at 50 μg IgG/ml) and incubated for 40 min on ice in the dark. Following incubation, 1 ml of FACS buffer was added to each tube and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation as above. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of FACS buffer containing 0.1 μg/ml propidium iodide. The cells were once again pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 250 μl of FACS buffer. Cell fluorescence was quantified on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer, and the data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA) was used to perform a one-way ANOVA to identify statistical differences in allantois explant measurements as well as in flow cytometry data. Kaleidagraph (version 3.6.2, Synergy Software, Reading PA) was used to determine the statistical significance of differences using Tukey's post hoc comparisons. The α was set to 0.05 for all of the statistical analyses. All of the charts were plotted using Kaleidagraph, and the error bars represent confidence intervals at 95%. S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 Expression Coincide with the Process of Vasculogenesis—RT-PCR was used to determine the temporal pattern of expression S1P receptors (S1P1–S1P5) during mouse embryonic development. S1P receptor expression was evaluated in the embryo proper and two extraembryonic tissues (the allantois and the yolk sac) at stages during which these tissues were undergoing vasculogenesis. The level of VE-cadherin mRNA expression was used as a measure of blood vessel formation in each tissue. VE-cadherin expression was first detected at 8.5–9.0 dpc in the embryo proper, yolk sac, and allantois (Fig. 1). In the prevascularized allantois (i.e. 7.5–8.0 dpc prior to the expression of VE-cadherin mRNA), S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 transcripts were expressed (Fig. 1). The expression of these three receptors persisted in the allantois during stages when nascent blood vessels first appeared (8.25 dpc) (22Argraves W.S. Larue A.C. Fleming P.A. Drake C.J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Downs K.M. Gifford S. Blahnik M. Gardner R.L. Development. 1998; 125: 4507-4520PubMed Google Scholar) and through periods in which angiogenesis and blood vessel maturation occurred (8.5–10 dpc). S1P1 and S1P3 mRNA expression showed a marked increase in expression during this later period. S1P4 and S1P5 transcripts were not detected in the allantois at any stage examined, suggesting that these receptors are not involved in vasculogenesis. In the yolk sac, prior to the expression of VE-cadherin (7.8–8.4 dpc), S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, and S1P5 transcripts were expressed (Fig. 1). In the prevascularized embryo proper (7.8–8.4 dpc), the expression of S1P2, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 was evident but little or no S1P1 was detectable (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 summarizes the temporal pattern of expression of each of the S1P receptor mRNAs in the tissues examined. Based on the collective findings, S1P1, S1P2, S1P3 but not S1P4, and S1P5 are expressed during periods of vasculogenesis (i.e. <8.4 dpc). Only S1P2 appeared to be expressed during earliest stages of vasculogenesis, irrespective of the site. However, S1P2 expression in prevascularized tissues was accompanied by the expression of either S1P1 or S1P3 or both. The expression of S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 receptors was also found to persist through later developmental stages during periods in which existing blood vessels become further reticulated and mature (8.5–10 dpc).Fig. 2Diagram illustrating the time line of expression of S1P receptors and sphingosine kinases during development.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sphingosine Kinase-2 Is Expressed during the Earliest Stages in Allantois Vasculogenesis—RT-PCR was also used to investigate the expression of sphingosine kinase-1 and -2 in the developing mouse embryo, yolk sac, and the allantois. In the prevascularized embryo proper, yolk sac, and allantois, sphingosine kinase-2 (SK2) was expressed from the earliest stage examined (7.5–8 dpc) and the expression persisted through to the latest stages examined (9.5–10 dpc) (Fig. 1). The level of the SK2 amplicon appeared to increase coincident with the expression of VE-cadherin in each of the three tissues (Fig. 1). By contrast, the expression of SK1 transcripts was not detected in the allantois at any of the stages examined. In the yolk sac, SK1 expression was not detected prior to the expression of VE-cadherin. In the embryo proper, SK1 was expressed at the earliest stages (7.8–8 dpc) but its expression was absent at 8–8.4 dpc and then reappeared at 8.5–10 dpc (Fig. 1). Since control reactions indicate that there was genomic DNA contamination of the 7.8–8 dpc embryo proper cDNA template, the apparent expression of SK1 at this early stage is equivocal. Taken together, the findings indicate that SK2 but not SK1 expression coincides with the earliest stages of vasculogenesis, irrespective of the site. The absence of expression of SK1 in the developing allantois, a tissue in which vasculogenesis is a key event, suggests that SK1 is not required for vasculogenesis. Furthermore, the findings also suggest that S1P expressed in embryonic tissues via the action of SK2 may be influencing the early events in the process of vasculogenesis. S1P Promotes Vasculogenesis in Cultured 7.8 dpc Allantois Explants—To investigate the role of S1P signaling in vasculogenesis, we evaluated the effects of exogenously added S1P on the process of de novo blood vessel formation in the cultured allantois explant model (22Argraves W.S. Larue A.C. Fleming P.A. Drake C.J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Downs K.M. Temkin R. Gifford S. McHugh J. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because serum is a rich source of S1P (25Igarashi Y. Yatomi Y. Kickler T.S. Am. J. Hematol. 1998; 57: 261-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we first evaluated the effect of culturing the explants in serum-free conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, 7.8 dpc allantois explants cultured in the absence of serum failed to form an expansive network of blood vessels as detected using antibodies to PECAM, a protein expressed by endothelial cells (Fig. 3D). Instead of the branched network of capillary-like vessels typically observed when the explants are cultured in serum-containing medium (Fig. 3, A–C), only small poorly reticulated clusters of rounded PECAM-positive cells formed in the absence of serum (Fig. 3, D–F). Often clusters of PECAM-positive cells were observed with few cell protrusions evident (Fig. 3, E and F, arrows). By contrast, in 7.8 dpc allantois explants cultured in serum-free medium containing S1P, there was a marked difference in the pattern of PECAM-positive cells (Fig. 3, G–I) as compared with explants cultured in the absence of serum. Networks of interconnected endothelial cells (i.e. reactive with PECAM antibodies) were evident in explants cultured in the presence of S1P (Fig. 3, G–I). Morphologically, PECAM-positive cells formed in the presence of S1P appeared less well spread than the ones formed in the presence of serum (Fig. 3, C versus I). Because endothelial cells (PECAM-positive cells) were formed in the 7.8 dpc allantois cultured in the absence of serum, the formation of the endothelial cell lineage does not appear to be dependent on S1P signaling. S1P Promotes Expansion of Vascular Networks in Cultured 8.5 dpc Allantois Explants—We next evaluated the influence of exogenous S1P on blood vessel formation in 8.5 dpc allantois explants. At 8.5 dpc, the allantois was vascularized and undergoing extensive neovascularization (22Argraves W.S. Larue A.C. Fleming P.A. Drake C.J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When explanted, 8.5 dpc allantoides were cultured in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and a highly branched network of PECAM-positive blood vessels was apparent after 24 h (Fig. 4A). However, in the absence of serum, PECAM-positive endothelial cells remained in the central portion of the explant and displayed extremely limited degree of reticulated network formation (Fig. 4B). By contrast, in serum-free medium containing S1P (Fig. 4C), vascular network formation was comparable with that observed in explants cultured in serum-containing medium. Not only did S1P promote network branching to a level equivalent to that observed in explants cultured the presence of serum but also the overall area of vascular networks formed in the presence of S1P was similar to the area of vascular networks that formed in serum-containing medium. S1P was also found to be effective at promoting allantois blood vessel formation at concentrations ranging from 33 nm to 1 μm (Fig. 4, C–F) with only a modest qualitative difference in the vasculatures formed over the range of 111 nm-1 μm. Even at the lowest S1P concentration tested (33 nm), vascular network formation was discernibly better than"
https://openalex.org/W2052428303,"Dysregulation of the centrosome duplication cycle has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Our previous work has shown that the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 oncoprotein rapidly induces aberrant centrosome and centriole duplication in normal human cells. We report here that HPV E7-induced abnormal centriole duplication is specifically abrogated by a small molecule CDK inhibitor, indirubin-3'-oxime (IO), but not a kinase-inactive derivative. Importantly, normal centriole duplication was not markedly affected by IO, and the inhibitory effects were observed at concentrations that did not affect the G1/S transition of the cell division cycle. Depletion of CDK2 by siRNA similarly abrogated HPV E7-induced abnormal centrosome duplication and ectopic expression of CDK2 in combination with cyclin E or cyclin A could rescue the inhibitory effect of IO. IO treatment also reduced the steady-state level of aneuploid cells in HPV-16 E7-expressing cell populations. Our results suggest that cyclin/CDK2 activity is critically involved in abnormal centrosome duplication induced by HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein expression, but may be dispensable for normal centrosome duplication and cell cycle progression."

Because signaling molecules and pathways cooperate to drive cancer progression, simultaneous targeting of multiple pathways is an appealing therapeutic strategy. With this in mind, we examined breast tumor cells for their sensitivity to the ErbB2 and FGFR inhibitors, PKI166 and PD173074, respectively. Simultaneous blocking of ErbB2 and FGFR-4 in MDA-MB-453 tumor cells had a stronger anti-proliferative effect than treatment with individual inhibitors. Examination of cell cycle regulators revealed a novel translation-mediated mechanism whereby ErbB2 and FGFR-4 cooperate to regulate cyclin D1 levels. Our results showed that FGFR-4 and ErbB2 via the MAPK and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathways, respectively, both contribute to the maintenance of constitutive activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin translational pathway. Dual inhibition of these receptors strongly blocked S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) activity and cyclin D1 translation, as attested by a decrease in cyclin D1 mRNA association with polysomes. Ectopic expression of active protein kinase B or active S6K1 abrogated the dual inhibitor-mediated down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression, demonstrating the importance of these FGFR-4/ErbB2 signaling targets in regulating cyclin D1 translation. S6K1 has the central role in this process, since small interfering RNA-targeted S6K1 depletion led to a decrease in cellular S6K1 activity and, as a consequence, repression of cyclin D1 expression. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism for controlling cyclin D1 expression downstream of combined activity of ErbB2 and FGFR-4 that involves S6K1-mediated translation.

In particular, the overexpression of the ErbB2 receptor has been detected in ∼30% of breast cancers and correlates with poor patient prognosis (1Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Oncologist. 1998; 3: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Another 30% of breast tumors displayed overexpression of FGFR-4, a member of a different RTK family (2Penault-Llorca F.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 840-847PubMed Google Scholar). High expression of ErbB2 in cancer cells leads to ligand-independent constitutive activation of the receptor and its downstream signaling, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (4Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5535) Google Scholar). FGFR also activates these major cellular signaling pathways (5Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front Biosci. 1999; 4: D165-D177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although FGFR and ErbB2 activities are clearly important in physiological processes of development, aberrant expression of these receptors affects cell proliferation, migration, survival, and angiogenesis, all hallmarks of cancer progression (5Klint P.

Recently, we have reported that down-regulation of FGFR-mediated signaling in breast tumor cells with high activity of these receptors also causes inhibition of cell proliferation (12Koziczak M. Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although both classes of receptors are widely expressed in breast cancer and both have been implicated in cell cycle control, there have been no reports examining the functional cooperation between these receptor families, the topic of this paper.The mTOR translational signaling pathway also participates in regulation of cell proliferation (13Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the overexpression of the mTOR target, S6K1, is a negative prognostic indicator for breast cancer and amplification of both S6K1 and ErbB2 is associated particularly with poor survival (14Couch F.J.

Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Activated S6K1 phosphorylates the 40 S ribosomal subunit protein S6 (18Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), which promotes the translation of mRNAs containing 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tracts. The translational repressor protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) is another downstream effector of mTOR. 4E-BP1 interacts with eIF4E and inhibits cap-dependent translation. Rapamycin, a bacterially derived drug that inhibits mTOR activity and phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1, causes a proliferative block in many types of cells (19Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F.

Blood. 1998; 91: 561-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some studies have identified cyclin D1 as a target of rapamycin-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation. However, depending on the cell type, this drug has been reported to regulate cyclin D1 expression by various means, including the control of mRNA and protein turnover, as well as translation (21Hashemolhosseini S.

Furthermore, rapamycin increases the expression of p27, an inhibitor of cyclin/cdk complexes, at both mRNA and protein levels (20Kawamata S. Sakaida H. Hori T. Maeda M. Uchiyama T.

Although these results indicate that mTOR activity is important for cell cycle progression, the mechanism of translational regulation in cell proliferation is still not fully understood.FGFR activity also contributes to cell proliferation via regulation of S6K1 phosphorylation (24Kanda S.

However, how the FGFR-mediated S6K1 regulation is linked to the cell cycle machinery has not been described. In this work, we investigated the mechanism by which FGFR-4 and ErbB2 receptor signaling contribute to S6K1-regulated cell proliferation in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, a cell line in which both receptors are constitutively active. To block the receptors, we used the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors PD173074 and PKI166 that selectively inhibit activation of FGFR and ErbB2, respectively. The combined use of the inhibitors causes significant down-regulation of mTOR pathway activity, inhibition of cyclin D1 translation, and, as a consequence, a strong block in cell proliferation. Our studies demonstrated that both MAPK and PI3K, acting downstream of FGFR and ErbB2, control S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, thereby cooperatively regulating the activity of the mTOR pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Inhibitors, and Antibodies—MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer epithelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator.

After infection, green fluorescent protein-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry and grown for another 4 days. Parental and virus-infected sorted cells were replated at a density of 40% and, 24 h later, were transfected with siRNA using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligoribonucleotide pairs (obtained from Qiagen) were used as follows: for S6K1, S6K1A (nucleotides 1795–1811) and S6K1B (nucleotides 1702–1721) (Gen-Bank™ accession number M60724.1); and control LacZ (nucleotides 2289–2309) (GenBank™ accession number M55068). Cell lysates were prepared 2 days after transfection and analyzed by Western blotting.RESULTSFGFR-4 and ErbB2 Cooperate to Maintain Constitutive Activation of MAPK and PI3K Signaling and to Drive Proliferation of MDA-MB-453 Breast Tumor Cells—The MDA-MB-453 breast tumor cells display active FGFR-4 that promotes constitutive MAPK signaling. We have previously shown that proliferation of these cells depends mainly on FGFR-MAPK-mediated signaling (12Koziczak M. Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MDA-MB-453 cells also overexpress ErbB2, leading to its constitutive activation. In this study, we asked what signaling pathways were driven by ErbB2 in these cells and whether there was any cooperation between the two receptors in terms of the proliferative response. To address this question, we used small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors selective for FGFRs (PD173074) (26Mohammadi M. Froum S. Hamby J.M. Schroeder M.C. Panek R.L. Lu G.H. Eliseenkova A.V. Green D. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5896-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and for ErbB receptors (PKI166) (27Traxler P. Bold G. Buchdunger E. Caravatti G. Furet P. Manley P. O'Reilly T. Wood J. Zimmermann J. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The treatment of the cells with PD173074 or PKI166 led to decreased activity of FGFR-4 or ErbB2, as shown by the lower phosphotyrosine content of the respective immunoprecipitated receptor (Fig. 1A). The activity of the MAPK and PI3K pathways was examined by determining phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-PKB levels as a readout for the activation status of the respective pathway (Fig. 1B). As previously shown, the inhibition of FGFR-4 blocks activity of the MAPK pathway in MDA-MB-453 cells (12Koziczak M. Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The loss of ErbB2 activity results in the down-regulation of PI3K signaling, whereas simultaneous targeting of the receptors with PD173074 and PKI166 suppressed the activity of both pathways (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, we consistently observed that simultaneous treatment with both inhibitors led to a stronger decrease in phospho-PKB levels in comparison with treatment with PKI166 alone, suggesting a possible cooperation between FGFR-4 and ErbB2 in the regulation of this pathway.The proliferation of MDA-MB-453 cells in response to individual or combined inhibitor treatment was examined next. Cells treated with either PKI166 or PD173078 were blocked by 26 and 61% in proliferation, respectively. Proliferation of the cells treated simultaneously with both inhibitors was completely blocked (Fig. 1C). To explore the anti-proliferative effects of the inhibitors at the level of the cell cycle, we performed flow cytometry analyses. The inhibition of ErbB2 signaling did not lead to a dramatic change in G1-accumulated cells (+2%), nor did cells accumulate in any other phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 1D and data not shown); however, as shown above, this increase was sufficient to slow down proliferation over the time course. PD173078 treatment led to a strong increase in G1-accumulated cells (+24%, Fig. 1D) as previously reported (12Koziczak M. Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and treatment with both inhibitors led to a further increase in G1 accumulation (+28%) (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that FGFR-4 and ErbB2 cooperate to control cell proliferation via their major downstream effector pathways, MAPK and PI3K. Based on cell counts and the cell cycle analysis, it appears that the combined activity of these pathways has a major impact on G1 regulators.FGFR-4 and ErbB2 Cooperate to Regulate Cyclin D1 Expression—Cyclin D1 is a major cell cycle regulator in breast tumor cells with active FGFR signaling (12Koziczak M. Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As a result, we examined the effect of dual inhibitor treatment on cyclin D1 expression. The treatment of MDA-MB-453 cells with PD173074 caused a decrease in cyclin D1 mRNA (Fig. 2A), which we have previously shown was due to transcriptional regulation (12Koziczak M. Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and protein expression (Fig. 2B). Neither cyclin D1 mRNA nor its protein levels were altered in PKI166-treated cultures (Fig. 2, A and B). Intriguingly, cells treated with both inhibitors had the same level of cyclin D1 mRNA as PD173074-treated cells (Fig. 2A), whereas the level of cyclin D1 protein was reduced (Fig. 2B). The expression of cdk4, the partner of cyclin D1, was not affected by any treatment (Fig. 2B). The PD173074-mediated block and the dual inhibitor-mediated block in cell proliferation correlated well with changes in cyclin D1 expression (Fig. 1C). These data suggested that the FGF and ErbB2 receptors cooperate via the downstream MAPK and PI3K pathways to control cyclin D1 expression and implied that simultaneously blocking the receptors affects cyclin D1 at a post-transcriptiona llevel.Fig. 2Effect of FGFR and ErbB2 inhibitors on cyclin D1 expression and protein synthesis.A, MDA-MB-453 cells were treated with the indicated inhibitors (2 μm). At the indicated times, cells were harvested and cyclin D1 mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis using a specific probe. Equivalent loading of RNA was confirmed by methylene blue staining of 18 and 28 S rRNA. The graph in the lower panel shows normalized cyclin D1 mRNA quantification measured by PhosphorImager. B, cells were treated with the indicated inhibitors for 8 h, and protein lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with cyclin D1 and cdk4 antibodies. Equivalent loading was confirmed by reprobing with anti-tubulin antibody. DMSO, Me2SO. C, cells were treated with inhibitors for 8 h and pulse-labeled for the last 1 h with [35S]methionine, and protein lysates were prepared. Cyclin D1 and cdk4 were immunoprecipitated (IP) from the lysates with specific antibodies, proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and the level of [35S]methionine incorporation was determined by PhosphorImager scanning. Graphs represent data from four independent experiments, and the mean values ± S.D. are shown with error bars. PD, the FGFR inhibitor PD173074; PKI, the ErbB2 inhibitor PKI166; rap, rapamycin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To obtain some insight into whether the RTK inhibitors act at the level of cyclin D1 translation, we compared their effects with those of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR (35Dumont F.J. Su Q. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 373-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-453 cultures were treated with the inhibitors and then labeled with [35S]Met, and the incorporation of label into cyclin D1 was quantified. In PD173074-treated cultures, there was a 36% decrease in [35S]Met-labeled cyclin D1 (Fig. 2C), which is likely to reflect the reduced cyclin D1 mRNA expression in these cells (Fig. 2A). As expected, in PKI166-treated cells [35S]Met-labeled cyclin D1 levels were the same as in Me2SO-treated control cells (Fig. 2C), reflecting the fact that this inhibitor had no effect on cyclin D1 expression (Fig. 2, A and B). In cultures treated with the combination of receptor inhibitors, the level of [35S]Met-labeled cyclin D1 was ∼20% decreased in comparison with its level in cells treated with PD173074 alone. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin resulted in a 15% decrease in [35S]Met-labeled cyclin D1 levels. The incorporation of [35S]Met into cdk4 was unaffected by the inhibitors (Fig. 2C). Because rapamycin had no effect upon cyclin D1 mRNA expression (data not shown), the results suggested that translational control accounts for ∼15–20% cyclin D1 levels. Interestingly, the enhanced reduction (∼20%) of [35S]Met incorporation into cyclin D1 in the presence of both RTK inhibitors compared with treatment with PD173074 alone was similar to the effect of rapamycin. These results suggested that the FGF and ErbB2 receptors and their downstream signaling pathways cooperate in the regulation of cyclin D1 translation. Moreover, they suggested that the cooperation is targeted to mTOR-dependent translation.FGF and ErB2 Receptors Cooperate to Regulate Activity of the mTOR Pathway—To gain insight into the molecular mechanism regulating cyclin D1 translation downstream of FGFR-4 and ErbB2, we examined the phosphorylation status of mTOR and its two effectors, S6K1 and 4E-BP1. One of the major phosphorylation sites thought to be important in controlling mTOR activity is Ser2448 (36Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

S6K1 activation is a multistep process that begins with the phosphorylation of amino acid residues Ser411, Ser418, Thr421, and Ser424 within the autoinhibitory domain by proline-directed kinases such as MAPK (17Weng Q.P.

https://openalex.org/W2053841000,"The constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is frequently detected in breast cancer cell lines but not in normal breast epithelial cells. Stat3 has been classified as an oncogene, because constitutively active Stat3 can mediate oncogenic transformation in cultured cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Since Stat3 appears to play an important role in breast cancer, it is of interest to investigate Stat3-regulated genes and elucidate Stat3-mediated oncogenesis. In this study, we investigated the Stat3-regulated genes in human breast epithelial cells. Upon overexpression of Stat3-C, a constitutively active Stat3 form, in nonmalignant telomerase immortalized breast (TERT) cells, the total mRNA was extracted and subjected to Affymetrix microarray analysis. Our results showed that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MEK5) was markedly induced (more than 22-fold increase, P<0.001) by Stat3-C expression. RT–PCR result also demonstrated that MEK5 mRNA was significantly induced by Stat3-C in TERT cells. The upregulation of MEK5 by Stat3-C was further confirmed by Western blot in MCF10A breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, in MDA-MB-435s breast carcinoma cells, which express high levels of activated Stat3 and MEK5, MEK5 protein was significantly reduced by using Stat3 short interfering RNA. The reduction of MEK5 was consistent with Stat3 knockdown in this breast carcinoma cell line. We also investigated MEK5 expression in different breast carcinoma cell lines and breast cancer tissues using tissue array analysis. Compared with nonmalignant breast epithelial cells or normal tissues without constitutively active Stat3 signaling, MEK5 protein levels are remarkably higher in breast carcinoma cell lines and cancer tissues with constitutively activated Stat3. Taken together, our findings suggest that constitutively active Stat3 upregulates MEK5 in the breast epithelial cells. MEK5 may be one of the Stat3-regulated genes and plays its essential roles in oncogenesis mediated by aberrantly activated Stat3 signaling in breast carcinomatosis and malignancies."

Poly(P)-dependent kinases have ATP-specific partners, and a knowledge of the crystal structure of poly(P)-dependent kinase may aid in understanding the structural relationship of poly(P)-dependent kinase to the ubiquitous ATP-specific kinase, i.e. to understand structural determinants enabling poly(P)/ATP-type and poly(P)-specific type kinases to use poly(P), ATP-specific kinase to reject poly(P) and poly(P)-specific kinase to reject ATP. Such understanding would lend insights into the evolutionary relationship of poly(P)-dependent kinase to ubiquitous ATP-specific kinase, where relationships are also of interest, since poly(P) could be formed and participate in ATP synthesis under ancient prebiotic conditions and serve as a possible ancient energy carrier preceding ATP (5Kornberg A. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 23: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Among poly(P)-dependent kinases, GMK, isolated from the Gram-positive bacterium Arthrobacter sp. strain KM, is a monomer with 30 kDa that phosphorylates glucose and mannose with preference for glucose through the use of poly(P) and ATP (3Mukai T.

Mori S. Mukai T. Suzuki S. Yamada T. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) but at 20 °C for 24 h with sufficient aeration. The expressed recombinant GMK was purified using the same procedure as for native-GMK (3Mukai T. Kawai S. Matsukawa H. Matuo Y. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3849-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that, after ammonium sulfate precipitation, the supernatant was directly applied to a butyl Toyopearl (Tosoh) column and eluted using the gradient in ammonium sulfate from 30 to 0%. After dialysis, eluted GMK was purified by a hydroxyl apatite (Nacalai Tesque) column using the gradient in potassium phosphate from 10 to 600 mm. Active fractions contained the purified GMK and were homogeneous on SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). GMK was crystallized by hanging-drop vapor diffusion method as described elsewhere (25Mukai T. Kawai S. Mori S. Mikami B. Murata K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1662-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The solution of a crystallization drop was prepared on a siliconized coverslip by mixing 3 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml GMK and 10 mm glucose in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) with 3 μl of mother liquor composed of 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 2% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 8.0. Crystals were soaked in several heavy atom derivative solutions composed of 1 mm UO2Ac2, 10 mm AgNO3, 10 mm GdCl3, 1 mm HgCl2, 10 mm K2Pt(CN)4, 2 mm TmCl2, and 1 mm EuCl3 for 20–60 min at 20 °C. Derivative solutions were prepared in a mother liquor, but 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 (for UO2Ac2) and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.9 (for the remainder), were included instead of 0.1 m Hepes, pH 8.0. Diffraction data for the native crystal of GMK up to 2.8 Å and derivative crystals at about 3.0 Å were collected with a Bruker Hi-Star multiwire area detector at 20 °C using CuKα radiation generated by a MAC Science M18XHF rotating anode generator and were processed with SADIE and SAINT software packages (Bruker). Diffraction data for further refinement up to 1.8 Å was collected using synchrotron radiation at a wave-length of 0.9 Å at the BL-41XU station of SPring-8 in Hyogo, Japan. Obtained data was processed, merged, and scaled using program package HKL 2000 (DENZO and SCALEPACK) (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) and truncated with the CCP4 program package. Structure Determination and Refinement—The crystal structure of GMK was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR). Major sites of heavy atoms were determined by interpretation of difference Patterson maps calculated at 3.0 Å of resolution. Additional heavy atom sites were determined from difference Fourier maps. The phase refinement was performed with program PHASES (27Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Results of heavy atom refinement and phasing by MIR at 3.0 Å of resolution are listed in Table I. An electron density map was made with the solvent-flattened (28Wang B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 90-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) MIR phase using data from 15.0 to 3.0 Å, and the map was averaged using noncrystallographic symmetry. The initial model built using an averaged MIR map at 3.0 Å of resolution was refined by stimulated annealing with molecular dynamics using X-PLOR (29Brünger A.T. XPLOR, Version 3.851. Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Yale University, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar) and CNS (30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Then, several rounds of restrained least squares refinement followed by manual model building were conducted to improve the initial model to the R-factor of 19.2% (free R-factor = 26.2%) at 2.8 Å of resolution using the TURBO-FRODO (AFMB-CNRS) program on a Silicon Graphics Octan computer. The model was further refined by using diffraction data up to 1.8 Å with simulated annealing with molecular dynamics using a CNS program package. Several rounds of restrained least squares refinement to a resolution of 1.8 Å followed by manual model building were conducted. Water molecules were incorporated when the difference in density was more than 3.0 σ above the mean and the 2 Fo - Fc map showed a density of more than 1.0 σ. The final model was determined with an R-factor of 19.1% (free R-factor = 22.0%) at 50.0–1.8 Å resolution.Table IStatistics for heavy atom derivatives of GMKCompoundUO2Ac2AgNO3GdCl3HgCl2K2Pt(CN)4TmCl2EuCl3Soaking conditionsConcentration (mm)1101011021Soaking time (min)20606060606020Data usedResolution limit (Å)3.12.72.83.23.03.13.5Phasing power0.620.880.750.420.840.810.65Rcullis0.7350.6370.7570.7640.7140.7130.757Rkraut0.1180.1080.0910.1250.0930.1050.081Number of sites2422822Average figure of merit0.4890.825 (after solvent flattening)0.883 (after averaging) Open table in a new tab The stereochemical quality of the model was assessed using PRO-CHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHAT-CHECK (32Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar) programs. Molecular models were prepared using MOLSCRIPT (33Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3D (34Merrit E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar) programs. Homology for the crystal structure was searched for in DALI (www.ebi.ac.uk/dali). Alignment of the primary structure was constructed by ClustalW (35Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). SCOP (36Lo Conte L. Ailey B. Hubbard T.J. Brenner S.E. Murzin A. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) was used to classify the crystal structure. Coordinates of crystal structures were taken from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org). Molecular models were superimposed by a fitting program implemented in TURBO-FRODO (Bio-Graphics). Coordinates and molecular topologies of pentapolyphosphate were generated using PRODRG (37Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4063) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Quality of Refined Model— Recombinant-GMK purified to homogeneity showed the same molecular structure (30 kDa, monomer) and N-terminal sequence and almost the same kinetic parameters as those of native-GMK (3Mukai T. Kawai S. Matsukawa H. Matuo Y. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3849-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). GMK was crystallized in the presence of glucose, phosphate, and sulfate, and prismatic colorless crystals of the GMK grew to a maximum 0.1 mm in 2 weeks at 20 °C. The GMK crystal belongs to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 65.21, b = 82.52, and c = 102.06 Å, and the solvent content was 49%, assuming 2 molecules in an asymmetric unit (25Mukai T. Kawai S. Mori S. Mikami B. Murata K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1662-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The structure of GMK was determined by MIR.

The final R-factor was 19.1% (free R-factor = 22.0%) for 49,926 reflections with F > 2.0 σ (F) at 50–1.8 Å of resolution. Interpretable electron density for GMK begins at residue 11 and ends at residue 263 for 1 molecule of GMK. N-terminal sequence analysis of recombinant-GMK showed that the first residue is missing, and the DNA sequence of the GMK gene exhibits a polypeptide of 267 residues of GMK. Electron density is, thus, present for all but the first 10 and last 4 residues of the polypeptide chain. Based on theoretical curves in the plot calculated by Luzzati (38Luzzati V Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar), absolute positional error was estimated to be close to 0.19 Å for the structure refined with data between 5.0 and 1.8 Å of resolution. The result of Ramachandran plot analysis (39Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar) showed that most of the nonglycine residues (93.9%) lie within most favored regions, and other residues (6.1%) fell within additional and generously allowed regions. There was one cis-peptide between Gln47 and Pro48 residues. Overall Structure of GMK Complexed with Glucose and Phosphates—The refined model consisted of 506 residues, 373 water, 2 glucose, and 4 phosphate molecules per 2 molecules of GMK (GMK-A/-B) in an asymmetric unit. Note that it was unclear if phosphate or sulfate was contained in GMK due to the similar molecular structures of the 2 anions and due to the presence of the 2 anions in the crystallization solution. To avoid confusion, we regard anions as phosphate A and B in this article. A ribbon model of the overall crystal structure of GMK together with one bound glucose and two bound phosphates (phosphate A and B) in the interdomain cleft is shown in Fig. 1a, and the topology of secondary structure elements of GMK is shown in Fig. 1b. One molecule of GMK, which is active as a monomer (3Mukai T. Kawai S. Matsukawa H. Matuo Y. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3849-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), consisted of two globular domains. The two domains are called N and C domains and are connected by two segments between SA5 and H3 and between SB5 and H9 (Fig. 1, a and b). Each domain consisted of three layers (α/β/α). The N domain consisted of H1:H2/SA3:SA2:SA1:SA4:SA5/H9, and the C domain of H3/SB3:SB2:SB1:SB4:SB5/H4:H5:H6:H7:H8. The 5-stranded mixed β-sheets in N and C domains showed order 32145 with strand 2 antiparallel to the rest of the sheet. The overall topology of the N domain was similar to that of the C domain (Fig. 1b). The primary structure of the N domain (residues 11–122) also showed homology with that of the C domain (residues 123–263), 18% identity, and 48% similarity over 116 residues, as calculated by ClustalW. The superimposition of the N domain on the C domain gave the root mean square deviation of 1.1 Å with 41 Cα within 2.0 Å (Fig. 1c). Taken together, we propose that the two domains stem from the duplication of one primordial domain. From overall crystal structural features, GMK was classified into the “ASKHA (acetate and sugar kinase/hsc70/actin)” superfamily on classification by Cheek et al. (40Cheek S. Zhang H. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 855-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or the “actin-like ATPase domain” superfamily on SCOP (36Lo Conte L. Ailey B. Hubbard T.J. Brenner S.E. Murzin A. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Both superfamilies are characterized by duplicate domains of a “ribonuclease H-like”-fold, where the fold consists of 3 layers (α/β/α) and the β-sheet has order 32145 as described above. Both superfamilies also contain eucaryotic HKs (40Cheek S. Zhang H. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 855-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Accordingly, homology analysis using the crystal structure as a query on DALI showed that GMK resembled eucaryotic HKs such as human HK I (PDB accession code 1QHA) and yeast HK PII (PDB accession code 2YHX). Glucose- and Phosphates-binding Sites of GMK—Ligands (glucose and phosphates) were refined with fractional occupancies of 1.0. The average B-factor for glucose was 13.4 Å2 and lower than the average for all atoms (24.6 Å2), but B-factors for phosphate-A (46.3 Å2), especially for phosphate-B (64.3 Å2), were higher than the average for all atoms. The electron density of the glucose O1 atom was observed for the β-anomer configuration (Fig. 2a). Selected contacts between GMK and ligands are listed in Table III. The O1 atom of phosphate B interacted with the Arg42 NH2 atom in GMK-A but with water 466 in GMK-B due to different directions in the side chain of Arg42 between GMK-A and GMK-B (data not shown). The binding sites of GMK with bound glucose, phosphate A, and phosphate B and their interactions with GMK are shown in Fig. 2b.Table IIISelected contacts between protein and ligandsLigand atomProtein atom (GMK-A/-B)Distance (GMK-A/-B)Element/domainÅGlucoseO1Glu180 OE12.6/2.6H4/CGlu180 OE23.1/3.2H4/CO2Glu168 OE12.7/2.7L-SB3:H4aLoop connecting SB3 and H4/CHis171 NE22.8/2.8L-SB3:H4/CWatbWat, water molecule 309/Wat 3232.8/2.7O3Glu168 OE22.6/2.7L-SB3:H4/CAsn122 OD13.0/3.0SA5/NO4Asp123 OD12.5/2.6H3/CWat 306/Wat 3192.8/2.7O5Wat 314/Wat 3182.9/2.9O6Asp123 OD22.7/2.8H3/CWat 358/Wat 3542.8/2.7Phosphate AO1Wat 384/Wat 442/Wat 3542.9/2.8/3.0O2Wat 471/Wat 4662.8/2.6O3Thr151 N3.0/3.0L-SB1:SB2/CWat 358/Wat 5112.8/3.0Wat 380/Wat 3543.1/2.9O4Thr151 OG12.8/2.5L-SB1:SB2/CPhosphate BO1Arg42 NH2/Wat 4662.9/2.7SA3/NO2Thr22 OG13.0/2.8L-SA1:SA2/NO3Lys25 NZ2.9/2.9SA2/NO4Arg42 NE2.8/2.8SA3/Na Loop connecting SB3 and H4b Wat, water molecule Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of GMK presented here is the first among bacterial GKs and poly(P)-dependent kinases, enabling us to understand the structural relationship of bacterial GK to eucaryotic HK and ADP-GK by comparing overall structures of enzymes and their substrate-binding sites. These comparisons also led us to propose putative binding sites of GMK for phosphoryl groups of ATP and for poly(P) and, finally, to obtain insights into the evolution of kinase as described below. Note that bacterial GK consists of Gram-positive and -negative bacterial GKs (6Wu G. Henze K. Müller M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), where GMK belongs to the former (3Mukai T. Kawai S. Matsukawa H. Matuo Y. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3849-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but no crystal structure of Gram-negative bacterial GK is known. Hence, we regard GMK as representative of bacterial GK. Overall Structures of GMK, Eucaryotic HK, and ADP-GK— The structural relationship of bacterial GK to eucaryotic HK and ADP-GK has not been understood. As mentioned above, however, the crystal structure of GMK appears to be related, at least to those of eucaryotic HK. We, therefore, attempted to compare GMK and eucaryotic HK in detail. Eucaryotic HKs consist of isozymes (e.g. mammalian (human) HK I-VI) (7Cárdenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Ureta T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 242-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 8Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). HK I (100 kDa) consists of N- and C-terminal halves (50 kDa), which have primary and tertiary structures, and substrate-binding sites, resembling each other and those of other 50 kDa eucaryotic HKs (human HK IV, also called GK, S. mansoni HK, and yeast HK PI and PII) (9Steitz T.A.

https://openalex.org/W1989425430,"We employed RNA-protein cross-linking to map the path of the nascent RNA as it emerges from within RNA polymerase II. A UV-cross-linkable uridine analog was incorporated at two positions within the first five nucleotides of the transcript. Only the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II cross-linked to the transcript in complexes containing 17–24-nucleotide (nt) RNAs. Extension of the RNA to 26 or 28 nt revealed an additional strong cross-link to the splicing factor U2AF65. In U17 complexes, in which the RNA is still contained within the polymerase, U2AF65 is tightly bound. In contrast, U2AF65 is more loosely bound in C28 transcription complexes, in which about 10 nt of transcript have emerged from the RNA polymerase. Cross-linking of U2AF65 to RNA in a C28 complex was eliminated by the addition of an excess of an RNA oligonucleotide containing the consensus U2AF65 binding site, but U2AF65 was not displaced by a nonconsensus RNA. These findings indicate that U2AF65 shifts from protein-protein to protein-RNA interactions as the RNA emerges from the polymerase. During transcription of one particular template at low UTP concentration, RNA polymerase II pauses just after synthesizing a transcript segment that is a U2AF65 binding site. Dwell time of the polymerase at this pause site was significantly and specifically reduced by the addition of recombinant U2AF65 to the transcription reaction. Therefore, the association of U2AF65 with RNA polymerase II may function not only to deliver U2AF65 to the nascent transcript but also to modulate efficient transcript elongation.

It is now appreciated that transcription is regulated during promoter clearance and transcript elongation as well as at transcription complex assembly (recently reviewed in Refs. 1Dvir A.

Also, it is becoming increasingly apparent that transcription and RNA processing are both interconnected and interdependent (recent reviews include Refs. 7Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 8Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 9Zorio D.A.R. Bentley D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is thus of considerable importance to carefully characterize the interaction of the transcription and processing machineries. We now have a detailed picture of RNA polymerase II structure (10Armache K.-J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6969-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), but how factors interact with this structure to modulate elongation and RNA processing is still very poorly understood. In particular, it is not certain how the transcript itself interacts with RNA polymerase II as transcription proceeds. Immediately upstream of the point of bond formation in RNA polymerase II, nascent RNA remains in hybrid with the DNA template for 8–9 bp. Structural information is available for the transcript in this region (12Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D.

A considerable segment of RNA remains inside the polymerase upstream of the point at which the transcript and template strand separate, since 17–19 nt of RNA within the transcription complex are protected from nuclease digestion and oligonucleotide hybridization probes (14Gu W.G. Wind M. Reines D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6935-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Reeder T.C. Hawley D.K.

These models place the emerging transcript on opposing sides of the dock region of Rpb1, 1The abbreviations used are: Rpb1, Rpb2, etc., the largest, second largest, etc., subunits of RNA polymerase II; U2AF, U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary splicing factor; U2AF65, the large subunit of U2AF; U2AF35, the small subunit of U2AF; RRM, RNA recognition motif; nt, nucleotide(s); CTD, C-terminal domain. the largest polymerase subunit. On path 1, the RNA passes around the base of the clamp domain toward subunit Rpb7, which contains both a ribonucleoprotein fold and an oligonucleotide binding fold (19Orlicky S.M. Tran P.T.

The Rpb4/Rpb7 heterodimer was shown to bind single-stranded DNA and RNA, and it has been suggested that Rpb7 may bind the emerging RNA transcript (10Armache K.-J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc.

On the alternative path, path 2, the RNA passes around the opposite face of RNA polymerase toward subunit Rpb8. Westover et al. (13Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) point out that in bacterial RNA polymerase only path 2 is electrostatically favorable. The simple extension of the RNA in their structure points toward this second groove (13Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Several findings suggest that the transcript remains in contact with the polymerase for some time after emerging from within the active center. Our earlier results (16Újvári A. Pal M. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32527-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) are consistent with a stabilizing interaction between the 5′-end of the RNA and the RNA polymerase at the point where the nascent transcript is 30–40 nt long. Hanna and Meares (21Hanna M.M. Meares C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4238-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that the 5′-end of transcripts generated with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase can cross-link to the polymerase up to a chain length of 94 nt. In order to better understand the exit path of the transcript from RNA polymerase II, we synthesized RNAs 17 nt and longer, which contained both cross-linkable residues and radioactive labels at their 5′-ends. We were surprised to discover that the emerging RNA immediately contacts U2AF65, a protein known to be involved both in splicing (reviewed in Ref. 22Moore M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2004; 7: 14-16Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and in nuclear export (23Zolotukhin A.S. Tan W. Bear J. Smulevitch S. Felber B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3935-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Blanchette M. Labourier E. Green R.E. Brenner S.E. Rio D.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 775-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We show that the presence of U2AF65 can assist RNA polymerase in recovery into transcriptional competence at pause sites, and we suggest that the close association of U2AF65 and polymerase is important in facilitating the participation of U2AF65 in RNA processing events. Reagents—We obtained reagents from the following sources: fast protein liquid chromatography-purified NTPs from Amersham Biosciences, 32P-labeled NTPs from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Bio-Gel A1.5m from Bio-Rad, oligo(dT)-cellulose and Deep Vent DNA polymerase from New England Biolabs, 5-iodo-UTP from Sigma, DNase I from Invitrogen, and streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads from Promega. CpA dinucleotide was obtained as a custom synthesis from Dharmacon. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The RNA oligonucleotides RNA2 and RNA3 used in Fig. 4C were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase and subsequently purified on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. HeLa cells for nuclear extract preparation were purchased from the National Cell Culture Center. The 8WG16 antibody against RNA polymerase II was obtained from Abcam and the MC3 antibody against U2AF65 was a gift from Dr. Margarida Gama-Carvalho. Transcription Templates—Templates for transcription were all based on the adenovirus major late promoter. The construction of the pML20-42, pML20-40(6G), and pML20-40(17G) plasmids is described elsewhere (25Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5343-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Pal M. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5700-5705Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Plasmid pML220 was constructed by PCR amplifying a 120-bp segment of pGR220 (27Rice G.A. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with the following primers: 5′-CCGCTCGAGCACAAACGGCAAGATCGAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3′. The PCR product was cut with restriction enzymes XhoI and HindIII and was cloned into pML20-42 between the XhoI and HindIII sites. This places the sequence CTTTTGTTCCCTTT 81 base pairs downstream from the transcription start site. To generate the pML222 plasmid, this sequence was altered by changing the underlined G to a T residue through the use of the Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. The DNA templates for transcription, which ranged in size from 190–298 bp, were produced by PCR. In all cases, the transcription start site was 96 bp from the upstream end of the fragment. For attached template experiments, the 5′ primer was biotinylated. DNA was purified using the Concert Rapid PCR Purification System (Marligen Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein Purification—Recombinant human U2AF (consisting of U2AF35 and U2AF65) was expressed in and purified from baculovirus-infected High-Five cells (Invitrogen) as described previously (28Graveley B.R. Hertel K.J. Maniatis T. RNA. 2001; 7: 806-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The insect cells (0.74 g) were resuspended in 6 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix, from Roche Applied Science) and sonicated two times for 10 s on ice. Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 1%. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was mixed with 0.5 ml of 50% Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (equilibrated with lysis buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed twice with 10 ml of lysis buffer plus 1% Nonidet P-40 and twice with 10 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, protease inhibitors, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The bound protein was eluted with two 1-ml aliquots of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, protease inhibitors, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and was dialyzed overnight against BC100 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA) plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. In addition to the full-length U2AF65 and U2AF35, a 55-kDa fragment of U2AF65 was also visible by Coomassie staining after resolving the U2AF preparation on an SDS gel. Depletion of U2AF from Nuclear Extract—HeLa cell nuclear extract was depleted of U2AF by passage through an oligo(dT)-cellulose column at 1 m KCl as described by Valcarcel et al. (29Valcarcel J. Martinez C. Green M.R. Richter J.D. mRNA Formation and Function. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 31-53Crossref Google Scholar). A mock depletion reaction was carried out by making nuclear extract 1 m in KCl without exposure to oligo(dT)-cellulose, followed by dialysis against a 100 mm KCl buffer. Assembly and Purification of Ternary Transcription Complexes— Preinitiation complexes were assembled by incubating a mixture containing 50% HeLa nuclear extract and 14 μg/ml template DNA fragment at a final concentration of 75 mm KCl and 8 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 20 min, followed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A1.5m to remove contaminating NTPs. The 1.9-ml gel filtration columns used BC100 (with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, instead of 20 mm Hepes) as the running buffer. Complexes U21 (pML20–40(6G) template) and U17 (pML20–40(17G) template) were generated by incubating preinitiation complexes with 1 mm CpA (initiating at position–1), 10 μm 5-iodo-UTP, 1 μm [α-32P]CTP, and 50 μm dATP as the energy source at 30 °C for 5 min. This produced initial transcripts of 6 nt (pML20–40(6G) template) or 7 nt (pML20–40(17G) template). These transcripts were then chased for 5 min at 30 °C by the addition of 200 μm CTP, UTP, and GTP (to generate U21 complexes) or 200 μm CTP, UTP, and ATP (to generate U17 complexes). The U21 and U17 complexes were then purified by the addition of Sarkosyl to 1% followed by gel filtration in MEM buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 62.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). This Sarkosyl rinsing procedure is described in detail in Ref. 30Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar. The transcripts in Sarkosyl-rinsed complexes were elongated by incubation for 5 min at room temperature with a 50 μm concentration of the appropriate NTPs as indicated in the figure legends. The experiment in Fig. 5 used templates attached to beads, which were assembled into preinitiation complexes as described (31Hawryluk P.J. Újvári A. Luse D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A23 complexes were generated by incubation with 100 μm ATP, 10 μm UTP, and 1 μm [α-32P]CTP at 30 °C for 5 min, followed by the addition of 10 μm CTP for an additional 5 min. After Sarkosyl rinsing, the A23 complexes were chased with all four NTPs at 30 °C as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5. Cross-linking—Samples were placed in microtiter plates in an ice water bath and irradiated for 20 min at 312 nm as described by Bartholomew et al. (32Bartholomew B. Dahmus M.E. Meares C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Fisher Biotech transilluminator in the presence of aprotinin and leupeptin at 10 μg/ml. They were then treated with DNase I (0.3 units/μl) and, where indicated, RNase A (50 ng/μl) for 15 min at 37 °C. An aliquot from each sample was extracted with phenol and chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resolved on a 13% denaturing polyacrylamide gel to check the RNA content. The rest of the samples were dissolved in SDS loading buffer and resolved on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide-SDS gels (Invitrogen). Gels were visualized on a STORM Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitations—Cross-linked complexes were immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions or after dissociation of the proteins under denaturing conditions. Complexes shown in Fig. 2 (left) were denatured in the presence of 1% SDS and 10 mm dithiothreitol by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and were subsequently diluted to a final concentration of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS. Samples in the middle panel of Fig. 2 were in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, and samples on the right were in the buffer reported by Robert et al. (33Robert F. Blanchette M. Maes O. Chabot B. Coulombe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9302-9306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All samples contained aprotinin and leupeptin at 10 μg/ml and were DNase I-digested (and RNase A-treated for samples in the right panel) before immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C with the 8WG16 anti-Rpb1 antibody (0.5 μg/ml) or MC3 anti-U2AF65 antibody (5 μl/ml of reaction). Gel Filtration—For the experiments in Fig. 4, A and B, 400-μl samples of transcription complexes were loaded onto a 40-ml (0.9 × 57-cm) gel filtration column (Bio-Gel A1.5m) that was equilibrated with MEM buffer. For Sarkosyl and salt rinsing, the column was preloaded with 400 μl of 400 mm KCl and 1% Sarkosyl in minimal essential medium before loading the sample that was also brought up to a final 400 mm KCl and 1% Sarkosyl. The excluded volume was collected in 750-μl fractions. Samples were supplemented with 8 mm MgCl2 and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. For the experiment in Fig. 4A, transcription complexes were advanced to U32 by the addition of 50 μm CTP, UTP, and GTP at room temperature for 5 min. Cross-linking took place as described above for 20 min. Samples were DNase I-digested (and, in A, RNase A-digested) before concentration by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Structural studies have shown that the catalytic center of RNA polymerase II resides in a cleft formed by the two largest subunits, Rpb1 and Rpb2 (recently reviewed in Ref. 34Cramer P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the path of the nascent RNA as it emerges from this central cleft, we have carried out RNA-protein cross-linking experiments in which UV cross-linkable residues were located near the 5′-end of the RNA. An earlier study (32Bartholomew B. Dahmus M.E. Meares C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated UV cross-linking of 19–40-nt RNAs containing 4-thiouridine to the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II. We found that whereas 4-thio-UTP was an acceptable substrate for extension of relatively long RNAs (∼150 nt) by RNA polymerase II, the polymerase would not incorporate 4-thio-UTP in the initial 5 nt of the transcript (data not shown). We therefore employed 5-iodo-UTP as our cross-linkable nucleotide. 5-Iodouridine shows specific photoreactivity with aromatic and sulfur-containing residues in proteins (35Meisenheimer K.M. Meisenheimer P.L. Koch T.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 88-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking of the 5′ Region of the Transcript to Components of the Transcription Complex—The template employed in the initial phases of our study, called pML20–40(6G), is derived from the adenovirus major late promoter. The first 30 nt of the transcript from this template are shown in Fig. 1A. RNA polymerase II transcription complexes were assembled by incubating pML20–40(6G) DNA in HeLa nuclear extracts. Transcription was initiated with the dinucleotide primer CpA in the presence of low concentrations of 5-iodo-UTP and radioactive CTP. This resulted in RNA synthesis up to the G stop at position +5. After the addition of GTP and high concentrations of UTP and nonlabeled CTP, transcription proceeded to position +20. These complexes contained two 5-iodouridine residues and two neighboring radiolabeled cytidines at the 5′-end, but no cross-linkable or labeled residues were present beyond the sixth base (see Fig. 1A). We will use the convention of designating transcripts and the associated complexes by the length of the RNA and the final base incorporated; thus, pausing of CpA-primed transcription at +20 on pML20–40(6G) generates U21 complexes. U21 complexes were partially purified by Sarkosyl rinsing, which involves transient exposure to the detergent Sarkosyl during gel filtration (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 1B, transcripts in the Sarkosyl-rinsed U21 complexes could be extended very efficiently to generate A24, G26, or C28 complexes. Reactions containing U21, A24, G26, and C28 complexes were exposed to UV light, and the proteins that were labeled by cross-linking to the RNA were visualized after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). Cross-linking of the U21 and A24 reactions resulted in the labeling of two major protein bands, of roughly 220–240 and 135 kDa (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). These are, as expected, the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II, Rpb1 and Rpb2, based on their molecular weights and the reactivity of the upper band with anti-Rpb1 antibodies (Fig. 2) (see also Ref. 32Bartholomew B. Dahmus M.E. Meares C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions in which the transcript was extended only 2 or 4 bases further downstream, to G26 or C28, showed an additional band upon UV cross-linking (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5). After RNase A treatment to truncate the cross-linked RNA, this protein displayed an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa (Fig. 2, right). There was no significant cross-linking in control reactions, which were not exposed to UV (Fig. 1C, lane 1) or in which no 5-iodo-UTP was used (not shown). Identification of Proteins Cross-linked to the Transcript— Reactions containing U21 or C28 complexes were UV-cross-linked and then immunoprecipitated with the anti-Rpb1 antibody 8WG16 (Fig. 2). In control reactions, which were denatured before precipitation (lanes 1–4), only the largest of the three labeled bands was recovered, confirming that this protein is the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. When the precipitations were done under native conditions, all three bands were recovered (lanes 5–8), indicating that the 65-kDa protein is part of the transcription complex and not simply cross-linked to free RNA that might have been released during the transcription reaction. We were surprised at the size of the 65-kDa cross-linked protein. We had expected from our detergent rinsing protocol that only core subunits of RNA polymerase II would be present in the transcript elongation complexes. However, no subunit of RNA polymerase II has a molecular mass close to the observed size. (Human Rpb2 and Rpb3 are 134 and 31 kDa, respectively; see Ref. 36McKune K. Moore P.A. Hull M.W. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6895-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that, contrary to expectation, general transcription factors might remain in our complexes. The 62-kDa subunit of TFIIH and the largest subunit (58 kDa) of TFIIF have roughly the correct molecular weight, but we could find no evidence that either protein is responsible for the 65-kDa band (data not shown). A critical clue was provided by the observations of Robert et al. (33Robert F. Blanchette M. Maes O. Chabot B. Coulombe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9302-9306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), who showed that the splicing factor U2AF65 copurifies with RNA polymerase II through a TFIIS affinity column. The identity of the 65-kDa band was established by the fact that it could be recovered from cross-linking reactions using a monoclonal antibody (37Gama-Carvalho M. Krauss R.D. Chiang L. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 975-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) against U2AF65 (Fig. 2, lanes 9–12). U2AF65 (U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary splicing factor, large subunit), together with U2AF35, forms the essential splicing factor U2AF (reviewed in Ref. 22Moore M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2004; 7: 14-16Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). U2AF65 recognizes the polypyrimidine tract of introns and recruits U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein to the branch point, whereas U2AF35 specifies the AG dinucleotide step at the 3′ splice site (22Moore M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2004; 7: 14-16Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). U2AF65 contains an N-terminal RS domain and three C-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRM domains) (38Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural studies suggest that only the first two RRM domains are involved in RNA recognition, and the third RRM represents a novel class of protein recognition motifs (39Kielkopf C.L. Lucke S. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1513-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). U2AF65 has also been shown to be involved in mRNA export (23Zolotukhin A.S. Tan W. Bear J. Smulevitch S. Felber B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3935-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the Drosophila U2AF large subunit (U2AF50) implicate dU2AF50 in the expression and nuclear export of transcripts from both intron-containing and intronless genes (24Blanchette M. Labourier E. Green R.E. Brenner S.E. Rio D.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 775-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The minimal length of RNA which allows cross-linking to U2AF65 is informative. As noted above, about 17 bases of the nascent transcript are contained within RNA polymerase II, as judged by protection against both nuclease and oligonucleotide probes (14Gu W.G. Wind M. Reines D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6935-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Reeder T.C. Hawley D.K. Cell. 1996; 87: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Újvári A. Pal M. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32527-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). U2AF65 protects 17 bases of a consensus RNA binding site from nuclease attack (see Ref. 40Kent O.A. Reayi A. Foong L. Chilibeck K.A. MacMillan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50572-50577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and references therein); however, at another site, only a short polypyrimidine sequence of 6 nt is protected (41Gu H.D. Schoenberg D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6264-6271Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Since U2AF65 recognizes its 17-nt site through two RRM domains (40Kent O.A. Reayi A. Foong L. Chilibeck K.A. MacMillan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50572-50577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a single binding domain would recognize 8–9 nt, consistent with the protection seen at the nonconsensus site (41Gu H.D. Schoenberg D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6264-6271Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, our ability to detect cross-linking beginning with a 26-nt RNA suggests that U2AF65 binds to RNA immediately upon its emergence from within the RNA polymerase, probably through the use of a single RRM domain. Transcription in a U2AF-depleted Nuclear Extract—In order to investigate the role U2AF65 plays during transcription, U2AF65 a"
https://openalex.org/W2155837598,"Cyanobacterial clock protein KaiC has a hexagonal, pot-shaped structure composed of six identical dumbbell-shaped subunits. Each subunit has duplicated domains, and each domain has a set of ATPase motifs. The two spherical regions of the dumbbell are likely to correspond to two domains. We examined the role of the two sets of ATPase motifs by analyzing the in vitro activity of ATPγS binding, AMPPNP-induced hexamerization, thermostability, and phosphorylation of KaiC and by in vivo rhythm assays both in wild type KaiC (KaiCWT) and KaiCs carrying mutations in either Walker motif A or deduced catalytic Glu residues. We demonstrated that 1) the KaiC subunit had two types of ATP-binding sites, a high affinity site in N-terminal ATPase motifs and a low affinity site in C-terminal ATPase motifs, 2) the N-terminal motifs were responsible for hexamerization, and 3) the C-terminal motifs were responsible for both stabilization and phosphorylation of the KaiC hexamer. We proposed the following reaction mechanism. ATP preferentially binds to the N-terminal high affinity site, inducing the hexamerization of KaiC. Additional ATP then binds to the C-terminal low affinity site, stabilizing and phosphorylating the hexamer. We discussed the effect of these KaiC mutations on circadian bioluminescence rhythm in cells of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacterial clock protein KaiC has a hexagonal, pot-shaped structure composed of six identical dumbbell-shaped subunits. Each subunit has duplicated domains, and each domain has a set of ATPase motifs. The two spherical regions of the dumbbell are likely to correspond to two domains. We examined the role of the two sets of ATPase motifs by analyzing the in vitro activity of ATPγS binding, AMPPNP-induced hexamerization, thermostability, and phosphorylation of KaiC and by in vivo rhythm assays both in wild type KaiC (KaiCWT) and KaiCs carrying mutations in either Walker motif A or deduced catalytic Glu residues. We demonstrated that 1) the KaiC subunit had two types of ATP-binding sites, a high affinity site in N-terminal ATPase motifs and a low affinity site in C-terminal ATPase motifs, 2) the N-terminal motifs were responsible for hexamerization, and 3) the C-terminal motifs were responsible for both stabilization and phosphorylation of the KaiC hexamer. We proposed the following reaction mechanism. ATP preferentially binds to the N-terminal high affinity site, inducing the hexamerization of KaiC. Additional ATP then binds to the C-terminal low affinity site, stabilizing and phosphorylating the hexamer. We discussed the effect of these KaiC mutations on circadian bioluminescence rhythm in cells of cyanobacteria. Circadian rhythms, 24-h biological oscillations of metabolic and behavioral activities observed ubiquitously in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, are endogenously regulated by circadian clocks. Several clock and clock-related genes from Drosophila, Neurospora, Arabidopsis, mice, and cyanobacteria have been cloned and analyzed (1Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria are the simplest organisms that exhibit circadian rhythms. We previously cloned and analyzed the kaiABC circadian clock gene cluster in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (hereafter called Synechococcus) that is essential for the generation of circadian rhythms in cyanobacteria. The gene cluster consists of two operons: kaiA, whose product (probably indirectly) enhances kaiBC promoter activity, and kaiBC, which is repressed by KaiC (probably indirectly) protein itself (2Ishiura M.

KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC interact in any combination (3Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and KaiC also interacts with SasA, a sensory histidine kinase that enhances kaiBC promoter activity (4Iwasaki H. Williams S.B. Kitayama Y. Ishiura M. Golden S.S. Kondo T. Cell. 2000; 101: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of Kai protein-based generation of circadian oscillations in cyanobacteria, we analyzed the proteins derived from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 by biochemical (5Hayashi F.

T. elongatus cells grow at over 50 °C, and their stable heat-tolerant proteins are suitable for analyses. KaiC has a duplicative structure (2Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R.

We determined the three-dimensional structure of KaiC by single particle analysis of cryoelectron microscopic images and demonstrated that the hexamer has a hexagonal, pot-shaped structure composed of six identical dumbbell-shaped subunits (6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The two spherical regions of the dumbbell-shaped structure probably correspond to the two domains of KaiC (6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The hexamerization of KaiC depends on ATP, probably on its binding to each KaiC subunit (6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The hexamerization does not require ATP hydrolysis, because AMPPNP, 1The abbreviations used are: AMPPNP, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); GST, glutathione S-transferase. an unhydrolyzable analog of ATP, as well as ATP, can induce the hexamerization (6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). ADP, AMP, and inorganic phosphate do not induce hexamerization (6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, ATP is a necessary cofactor for KaiC hexamerization. In the presence of ATP, KaiC is phosphorylated by KaiC itself, and the phosphorylation is enhanced by KaiA (7Uzumaki T. Fujita M. Nakatsu T. Hayashi F. Shibata H. Itoh N. Kato H. Ishiura M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We demonstrated that two molecules of KaiA dimer can interact with one molecule of KaiC hexamer and that one molecule of KaiA dimer interacting with one molecule of KaiC hexamer is enough to enhance KaiC phosphorylation (5Hayashi F. Itoh H. Fujita M. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Ishiura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). By x-ray crystal structure analysis, in vitro biochemical analysis, and in vivo rhythm assays, we demonstrated that the His270 residue in the C-terminal clock-oscillator domain of KaiA is essential to clock oscillation in vivo and important for both the binding of KaiA to KaiC and the enhancement of KaiC phosphorylation by KaiA (7Uzumaki T. Fujita M. Nakatsu T. Hayashi F. Shibata H. Itoh N. Kato H. Ishiura M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although ATP, not ADP, is required for the hexamerization of KaiC, ATP is hydrolyzed into ADP and Pi in the KaiC phosphorylation reaction. How does KaiC enable the contradictory reactions mediated by ATP? Two different domains in the KaiC subunit (one at the N-terminal and one at the C-terminal) may be involved. To clarify the roles of these ATPase motifs, we prepared four mutant KaiCs, each carrying a mutation on Walker motif A or a pair of CatEs in each domain, and examined their ATP binding, hexamerization, stabilization, and phosphorylation in vitro. We prepared cyanobacterial cells expressing the mutant KaiCs and examined the effects of the mutations on circadian oscillations in vivo. Plasmid Construction—The plasmids that express wild type KaiC derived from T. elongatus (hereafter called KaiCWT) and the KaiCK53H and KaiCK294H mutants were described previously (6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We mutated the Glu78 and Glu79 residues in the N-terminal domain of KaiC and the Glu318 and Glu319 residues in its C-terminal domain to Gln by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis of the T. elongatus kaiC gene (the resulting KaiCE78Q&E79Q protein was named KaiCCatE1- and the resulting KaiCE318Q&E319Q protein was named KaiCCatE2-). We conducted two PCRs using T. elongatus genomic DNA as a template and two sets of primers: 1 and 3, and 2 and 4 Supplemental Data). We conducted the third PCR using primers 1 and 2 and the two PCR products as a template, and we cloned the PCR product into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). We named the resulting plasmid pTeCatE1-. We similarly constructed plasmid pTeCatE2-, using four primers: 1, 2, 5, and 6 (Supplemental Data). We introduced the plasmids into Escherichia coli DH 5α and BL21 and grew the cells in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) and Terrific Broth and on LB plates containing 1.5% agar in LB. Production of KaiCs in E. coli and Their Purification—Production of KaiCs (KaiCWT, KaiCK53H, KaiCK294H, KaiCCatE1-, and KaiCCatE2-) in E. coli BL21, their purification, protein determination, and SDS-PAGE were carried out as described previously (5Hayashi F. Itoh H. Fujita M. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Ishiura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, KaiCs were overproduced in E. coli cells as soluble GST fusion proteins and trapped with glutathione-Sepharose-4B. The KaiCs were excised from the GST fusion proteins by PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) and purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex200 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Each protein eluted as a single symmetric peak at the position expected for a globular protein of about 60 kDa (data not shown). ATPγS Filter Binding Assay and Hill Plot Analysis—The amount of ATPγS (Amersham Biosciences) bound to KaiCs was measured by adsorption to nitrocellulose membrane filters (S & S, Arthur H. Thomas, Philadelphia, PA; 0.45-μm pore size, 25-mm diameter) as described previously (6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). KD values for ATPγS were calculated by Scatchard plot analysis. Briefly, a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl, [35S]ATPγS, and 12.5 pmol of KaiCs was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Then, 40 μl of the mixture was filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane presoaked in a washing buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm MgCl2 in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The filter was washed with 6 ml of washing buffer, dried, and then soaked in a toluene-based scintillation mixture. The radioactivity of [35S]ATPγS retained on the filter was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Assay for the Hexamerization of KaiCs—KaiC hexamerization, Native-PAGE, and determination of the Hill constants and KH value (the concentration giving half-saturation of the amount of KaiC hexamer induced) for AMPPNP were carried out as described previously (6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, KaiCs were incubated with various concentrations of AMP-PNP at 25 °C for 30 min and immediately put on ice, and 4-μl aliquots of the mixtures were electrophoresed on PhastGel Gradient 8-25% polyacrylamide gels, which were then stained with PhastGel Blue R. We determined the amounts of KaiC hexamer by densitometry and analyzed the Native-PAGE data by Hill plot analysis. Assay for the Thermostability of Hexameric KaiCs by Native-PAGE—To induce the hexamerization of KaiC, we incubated KaiC monomer (11 μm) with 0.5 or 20 mm AMPPNP in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 150 mm NaCl at 4 °C overnight, and confirmed the hexamerization by Native-PAGE as described previously (6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We determined the thermostability of the KaiC monomers and hexamers as follows: 10-μl aliquots of a reaction mixture containing KaiC monomer or hexamer were transferred to 1.5-ml plastic microcentrifuge tubes, overlaid with 30 μl of mineral oil, and incubated at various temperatures for 30 min. We then subjected the aliquots to Native-PAGE on PhastGel Gradient 8-25% gels and stained the gels with 0.1% PhastGel Blue R (Amersham Biosciences) solution in 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid using a PhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences). We used a densitograph system (AE-6920V-FX, ATTO) to estimate the densities of the bands that corresponded to native KaiC monomers and hexamers. We defined the relative amount of KaiC hexamers formed after incubation at 4 °C overnight as 100%. Assay for the Phosphorylation of KaiCs in the Presence or Absence of KaiA—We assayed KaiC phosphorylation as described previously (5Hayashi F. Itoh H. Fujita M. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Ishiura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, KaiC monomer (7.3 pmol in hexamer) was incubated with 1 mm ATP in 30 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2 at 50 °C for various times in the presence or absence of 43.8 pmol of KaiA (in dimer). We electrophoresed 15 μl of the reaction mixtures on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained the gels with Simply Blue™ SafeStain (Invitrogen). We estimated the densities of the bands corresponding to phosphorylated KaiC (p-KaiC) and non-phosphorylated KaiC by densitometry, as described above. Assay for the Phosphorylation of KaiCs Using [γ-32P]ATP—We assayed KaiC phosphorylation using [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (5Hayashi F. Itoh H. Fujita M. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Ishiura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 43.8 pmol of KaiC monomer was incubated with 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (0.33 pCi/mm, Amersham Biosciences) in 30 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 43.8 pmol of KaiA (in dimer) at 50 °C for 2 h. We electrophoresed 15 μl of the reaction mixture on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. We used a BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji) to visualize the radioactivity incorporated into KaiC bands. In Vitro Mutagenesis and in Vivo Rhythm Assay—We mutated the Synechococcus kaiC gene in a kaiBC operon segment by in vitro mutagenesis, transferred the segment into a specific targeting site (TS2) in the genome of a PkaiBC::luxAB bioluminescence reporter strain of Synechococcus with a deletion of the kaiBC operon, and we monitored the bioluminescence rhythms of the strain as described previously (7Uzumaki T. Fujita M. Nakatsu T. Hayashi F. Shibata H. Itoh N. Kato H. Ishiura M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Kutsuna S. Kondo T. Aoki S. Ishiura M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed a plasmid disrupting the kaiBC operon, pDkaiBC, by deleting a 1832-bp AflII-EcoRI fragment carrying both the whole coding region of the kaiB gene and a 1405-bp segment carrying the 5′-coding region of the kaiC gene in pCkaiABC (2Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). We then transformed PkaiBC::luxAB cells with pDkaiBC to construct strain PkaiBC::luxAB with a deletion of the kaiBC operon in the genome as a host strain and selected with spectinomycin dihydrochloride (40 μg/ml) (strain PkaiBC::luxABΔkaiBC). We constructed targeting vector pTS2kaiBC carrying a kaiBC operon segment (nucleotides -547 to +1918; the first nucleotide A of the translation initiation codon of the kaiB gene is numbered +1) by inserting a 2464-bp NcoI-NheI fragment of pCkaiABC into the BamHI site of targeting vector pTS2K (11Kutsuna S. Kondo T. Aoki S. Ishiura M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lys52 and Lys294 in Synechococcus KaiC correspond to Lys53 and Lys294 in T. elongatus KaiC, respectively. Glu77,78 and Glu318,319 in Synechococcus KaiC correspond to Glu78,79 and Glu318,319 in T. elongatus KaiC, respectively. We mutated the Synechococcus kaiC gene in the kaiBC operon segment by PCR mediated site-directed mutagenesis using Synechococcus genomic DNA as template DNA. We mutated Lys52 of Synechococcus KaiC to a histidine residue by two PCRs using primer sets 7 and 8, and 9 and 10 (Supplemental Data). Then, we carried out a third PCR using the resulting two PCR products as templates and primer set 7 and 10. The PCR product was digested with HpaI and EcoRI, and a 1450-bp HpaI-EcoRI fragment was inserted into the HpaI-EcoRI site of pTS2kaiBC (named pTS2kaiBCK52H). We similarly mutated Lys294 of Synechococcus KaiC to a histidine residue using the two primer sets 7 and 11, and 12 and 10 (pTS2kaiBCK294H), and we mutated the Glu77 and Glu78 residues of Synechococcus KaiC to glutamine residues using the two primer sets 7 and 13, and 14 and 10, respectively (pTS2kaiBCCatE1-). We mutated both the Glu318 and Glu319 residues to glutamine residues using primer sets 7 and 15, and 16 and 10, respectively (pTS2kaiBCCatE2-). To construct a PkaiBC::luxAB/ΔkaiBC reporter strain expressing KaiCWT and four mutant KaiCs (KaiCK52H, KaiCK294H, KaiCCatE1-, and KaiCCatE2-), we transformed cells of strain PkaiBC::luxAB/ΔkaiBC with five kaiBC constructs (pTS2kaiBC, pTS2kaiBCK52H, pTS2kaiBCK294H, pTS2kaiBCCatE1-, and pTS2kaiBCCatE2-) to target the constructs into TS2 and selected the cells with kanamycin sulfate (30 μg/ml). Design of Mutants—KaiC is composed of an N-terminal domain (residues 1-268) and a C-terminal domain (residues 269-518) (6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The two domains showed an identity of 23% and a similarity of 13%. Each domain contains a set of ATPase motifs (one Walker motif A and a pair of CatEs and one Walker motif B) (Fig. 1A and Ref. 6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To clarify the roles of the two sets of ATPase motifs, we designed four T. elongatus KaiC mutants, each carrying a mutation on Walker motif A or the CatE pair in one domain (KaiCK53H, KaiCK294H, KaiCCatE1-, and KaiCCatE2-) (Fig. 1, B and C). Although we tried to prepare several other mutant KaiCs carrying different amino acid substitutions located on the two Walker motif As from those described above (G47TSGTG52-K53T54 → A47TSGTA52A53A54, G288ATGTG293K294T295 → A288ATGTGA293A294A295, K53M, K294M), we could not obtain proteins suitable for biochemical analysis because they became denatured during preparation. Binding of ATPγS to KaiCWT and Mutant KaiCs—To clarify the significance of residues Glu78,79, Glu318,319, Lys53, and Lys294 in the binding of ATP to KaiC, we determined the number of nucleotide-binding sites per KaiC subunit and KD values for ATPγS by the filter binding assay using [35S]ATPγS, and we applied Scatchard plot analysis to the results (Fig. 2 and Table I).Table IScatchard plot analysis of the binding of ATPγS to KaiCsKaiCWTKaiCCatE1-KaiCCatE2-KaiCK53HKaiCK294HNumber of ATPγS bound per KaiC subunit22222KD (μm)aValues represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate assays and were calculated using the Scatchard plot analysis shown in Fig. 234 ± 772 ± 1448 ± 22166 ± 4799 ± 47a Values represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate assays and were calculated using the Scatchard plot analysis shown in Fig. 2 Open table in a new tab We found that two ATP molecules bound to one molecule of the KaiCWT subunit, suggesting that both ATPase motifs on KaiC were functional nucleotide-binding sites. All the mutant KaiC subunits we examined also bound two molecules of ATPγS. The apparent KD values of mutant KaiCs carrying mutations on N-terminal ATPase motifs (KaiCK53H and KaiCCatE1-) were 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than those of the mutant KaiCs carrying mutation on C-terminal ATPase motifs (KaiCK294H and KaiCCatE2-), suggesting that the affinity for ATP is higher for the N-terminal motifs than for the C-terminal motifs. Thus, ATP binding to the N-terminal motifs is favored. The apparent KD values of KaiCK53H and KaiCK294H were 4.9 and 2.9 times higher than that of KaiCWT, respectively, whereas those of KaiCCatE1- and KaiCCatE2- were 2.1 and 1.4 times higher than that of KaiCWT, respectively. These results suggest that Lys53, Lys294, Glu78,79, and Glu318,319 are involved in the binding of ATP, with Lys53 and Lys294 being more significantly involved. Hexamerization of KaiCWT and Mutant KaiCs—We examined which N-terminal or C-terminal ATPase motifs are responsible for KaiC hexamerization. We determined the KH values of KaiCWT, KaiCCatE1-, KaiCCatE2-, KaiCK53H, and KaiCK294H by Native-PAGE (Fig. 3A) and the Hill plot analysis of the Native-PAGE data (Fig. 3B and Table II).Table IIHill plot analysis of the hexamerization of KaiCsKaiCWTKaiCCatE1-KaiCCatE2-KaiCK53HKaiCK294HHill constant1.8 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.1KH (μm)aValues represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate assays and were calculated using the Hill plot analysis shown in Fig. 310 ± 0.486 ± 1341 ± 6.61,183 ± 120135 ± 11a Values represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate assays and were calculated using the Hill plot analysis shown in Fig. 3 Open table in a new tab Consistent with the order of increasing KD values (Table I), the apparent KH values for AMPPNP required for KaiC hexamerization increased in the order KaiCWT < KaiCCatE2- < KaiCCatE1- < KaiCK294H < KaiCK53H (Table II). The lower the dissociation constant for ATPγS were, the lower were the KH values for the AMPPNP required for the hexamerization. The apparent KH values of KaiCK53H and KaiCK294H for AMPPNP required for the hexamerization were 118 and 13 times higher than KH value of KaiCWT, suggesting that Lys53 in N-terminal Walker motif A is more critical for hexamerization than Lys294 in C-terminal Walker motif A. The apparent KH value of KaiCCatE1- was 2.3 times higher than the KaiCCatE2- value, suggesting that residues Glu78,79 (N-terminal CatEs) are more significantly involved in the hexamerization than residues Glu318,319 (C-terminal CatEs). Thus, such mutations on N-terminal Walker motif A and CatEs affected hexamerization more significantly than their C-terminal counterparts. The apparent KH values of KaiCK294H and KaiCCatE2- were 4 and 13 times higher than that of KaiCWT, respectively, suggesting that the latter Walker motif A and CatEs are also responsible for hexamerization. We concluded, therefore, that, although all residues examined (Glu78,79, Glu318,319, Lys53, and Lys294) contribute, it is Glu78,79 and Lys53 in N-terminal ATPase motifs that are mainly responsible for KaiC hexamerization. The Hill constant values of KaiCCatE1- (1.7) and KaiCWT (1.8) were similar, suggesting that residues Glu78,79 did not affect the cooperativity of the KaiC hexamerization induced by AMP-PNP binding. The Hill constant values of KaiCCatE2-, KaiCK53H, and KaiCK294H, on the other hand, were 0.9, indicating that residues Glu318,319, Lys53, and Lys294 are involved in the cofactor (AMPPNP) cooperativity in hexamerization. Thermostabilities of KaiCWT and Mutant KaiCs—To examine the role of KaiC residues Glu78,79, Glu318,319, Lys53, and Lys294 on the thermostability of KaiC hexamer, we quantitatively determined the thermostabilities of KaiCWT and the mutant KaiCs by Native-PAGE and estimated their Tm values from heat denaturation curves (Fig. 4). We prepared hexamers of KaiCWT and the mutant KaiCs by incubating the monomers with 0.5 or 20 mm AMPPNP at 4 °C overnight. We found that 20 mm AMPPNP was sufficient to induce complete hexamerization of all KaiCs and that 0.5 mm AMPPNP was enough to induce complete hexamerization of KaiCTWT, KaiCCatE1-, KaiCCatE2-, and KaiCK294H, but not KaiCK53H, because the apparent AMPPNP KH value for KaiCK53H was 1.2 mm (Table II). We assayed the thermostability of the above hexamers. The Tm values of KaiCWT were similar in the presence of 0.5 mm and 20 mm AMPPNP and were similar to the values of KaiCCatE1- (Table III). The Tm values of KaiCCatE2- obtained in the presence of 0.5 and 20 mm AMPPNP, in contrast, differed and were 12-30 °C lower than those of KaiCWT and KaiCCatE1-. These results indicate that Glu318,319 in the C-terminal CatEs but not Glu78,79 in the N-terminal CatEs are involved in KaiC hexamer thermostability. The heat denaturation of KaiCCatE2- probably resulted from the denaturation of the hexamers, not of the monomers that might have been dissociated from the hexamers by the release of AMPPNP, because of its lower KH values for AMPPNP (0.14 mm) and because KaiCCatE1- was as thermostable as KaiCWT despite its higher KH value (1.18 mm). The Tm values of KaiCK294H were as low as those of KaiCCatE2-, suggesting that residue Lys294 in C-terminal Walker motif A is also involved in the thermostability of the KaiC hexamer.Table IIITm values for the heat-denaturation of KaiCWT and mutant KaiCsAMPPNPTmaValues represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate assays and were calculated using the heat-denaturation curves shown in Fig. 4KaiCWTKaiCCatE1-KaiCCatE2-KaiCK53HKaiCK294Hmm°C0.563 ± 1.467 ± 1.137 ± 1.443 ± 0.337 ± 0.12068 ± 0.372 ± 0.456 ± 0.366 ± 0.441 ± 0.4a Values represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate assays and were calculated using the heat-denaturation curves shown in Fig. 4 Open table in a new tab The denaturation curve of KaiCK53H in the presence of 20 mm AMPPNP, a concentration much higher than its apparent KH value (1.18 mm), probably reflected the heat denaturation of the hexamer (Fig. 4), and the Tm value (66 °C) of KaiCK53H was almost the same as that of KaiCWT (68 °C). On the other hand, when we used the KaiCK53H incubated with 0.5 mm AMPPNP, the Tm value was 43 °C, which was much lower than the value obtained after incubation with 20 mm AMPPNP (66 °C). This reduction of Tm value in the presence of 0.5 mm AMPPNP was probably reflected by the depolymerization of its hexamer. Because the KaiCK53HKH value for AMPPNP was 1.18 mm (Table II), 0.5 mm AMPPNP was not sufficient to induce complete hexamerization of KaiCK53H. Because the Tm value of KaiC monomer was 32 °C (data not shown), monomers were denatured earlier than hexamers in the denaturation reaction. The concentration of native KaiCK53H monomer decreased irreversibly by heat denaturation, resulting in the depolymerization of KaiCK53H hexamer. Consequently, the population of KaiCK53H hexamers decreased (Fig. 4B). We concluded, therefore, that residue Lys53 in N-terminal Walker motif A is not significantly involved in the thermostability of the KaiC hexamer. The population of hexamers for KaiCK53H increased between 4 and 20 °C. The reason for this hexamerization is unclear at present. In conclusion, Glu318,319 and Lys294 in C-terminal ATPase motifs are responsible for the stabilization of KaiC hexamer. Phosphorylation of KaiCWT and Mutant KaiCs—KaiC prepared from GST-KaiC produced in E. coli cells shows a doublet band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the upper band corresponds to p-KaiC formed by the phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by KaiC itself (7Uzumaki T. Fujita M. Nakatsu T. Hayashi F. Shibata H. Itoh N. Kato H. Ishiura M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, when prepared and assayed similarly, KaiCK294H and KaiCCatE2- showed single bands that did not correspond to p-KaiC (data not shown). We examined the phosphorylation of KaiCWT and four mutant KaiCs in the presence or absence of KaiA, which enhances KaiC phosphorylation (Figs. 5, A and B). Following a 2-h incubation with 1 mm ATP, the relative amount of the band corresponding to p-KaiCWT increased from 34 to 43% in the absence of KaiA and 56% in its presence. The relative amount of the p-KaiCK53H, p-KaiCCatE1-, and p-KaiC WT band increased similarly, but we could not detect any p-KaiCK294H or p-KaiCCatE2- bands even in the presence of KaiA (Fig. 5, A and B). Nor could we detect incorporation of γ-32P from [γ-32P]ATP into KaiCK294H and KaiCCatE2-, whereas γ-32P was significantly incorporated into KaiCWT, KaiCK53H, and KaiCCatE1- (Fig. 5C), indicating that KaiCK294H and KaiCCatE2- lacked KaiC phosphorylation activity. Therefore, we concluded that Glu318,319 and Lys294 in C-terminal ATPase motifs are responsible for KaiC phosphorylation activity. In Vivo Bioluminescence Rhythms—We recently demonstrated that T. elongatus has a circadian clock and developed a circadian bioluminescence rhythm system in T. elongatus (12Onai K. Morishita M. Itoh S. Okamoto K. Ishiura M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4972-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have not refined the system enough to use it for detailed in vivo rhythm analysis such as that described below, but because Synechococcus KaiC is not stable enough to be characterized in vitro, we used T. elongatus KaiC. We examined the functional importance of the two pairs of CatEs and each lysine residue on the two Walker motif As in KaiC by in vitro mutagenesis and in vivo rhythm assays using a PkaiBC::luxAB bioluminescence reporter strain of Synechococcus expressing wild type or mutant Synechococcus KaiCs (Fig. 6). Mutations in the N-terminal and C-terminal CatEs (Fig. 6, KaiCCatE1- and KaiCCatE2-) and those of the lysine residue in the N-terminal Walker motif A (Fig. 6, KaiCK52H) caused an almost complete disruption of circadian bioluminescence rhythms, indicating that these ATPase motifs are critical to clock oscillation. The substitution of histidine for Lys294 in C-terminal Walker motif A caused rhythm irregularities (Fig. 6, panel KaiCK294H): 1) the bioluminescence of the cells decreased transiently after their transfer to constant light conditions, 2) the appearance of the first bioluminescence peak was delayed (28.6 ± 2.4 h, n = 124) compared with the strain expressing Synechococcus KaiCWT (10.8 ± 0.8 h, n = 65), and 3) the period lengthened in each cycle (first to the second peak = 29.5 ± 6.8 h, n = 124; second to the third peak = 39.9 ± 15.5 h, n = 124; third to the fourth peak = 45.3 ± 14.6 h, n = 59). This indicates that Lys294 in the C-terminal Walker motif A is important to normal circadian oscillation. Substituting histidine for the lysine residue in either the N- or C-terminal Walker motif A increased the apparent KD values for ATPγS more significantly than did substituting glutamine for either of the CatEs (Fig. 2 and Table I). This observation is consistent with previous data showing that the conserved Lys residue on Walker motif A in the Walker-type ATPase (13Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), such as RecA (14Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) and F1-ATPase (15Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar), binds ATP by interacting with β- and γ-phosphate groups of ATP, whereas CatE binds ATP weakly by interacting with the γ-phosphate group of ATP via a water molecule. Recently, the crystal structure of Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 KaiC hexamer with 12 molecules of ATPγS was determined (16Pattanayek R. Wang J. Mori T. Xu Y. Johnson C.H. Egli M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 375-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Consistent with our pot-shaped structure of T. elongatus KaiC hexamer determined by single particle analysis (6Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. Genes to Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the structure was relatively wide and open at the N-terminal end and narrower for a part of the C-terminal domain. Here, we showed the different roles of the two domains: hexamerization in N-terminal domain and stabilization and phosphorylation in C-terminal domain (Fig. 7). In their structure, ATP binding modes are different between N-terminal and C-terminal domains, and different roles of the two domains were anticipated (16Pattanayek R. Wang J. Mori T. Xu Y. Johnson C.H. Egli M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 375-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Based on the different roles of two sets of ATPase motifs demonstrated here, we propose the following reaction mechanism (Figs. 7 and 8): 1) A KaiC subunit has two types of ATP-binding sites, a high affinity site in the N-terminal domain and a low affinity site in the C-terminal domain; 2) ATP preferentially binds to the N-terminal high affinity site, inducing KaiC to form an unstable hexamer; 3) ATP binds to the C-terminal low affinity site, inducing stabilization of the hexamer. Alternatively, the presence of the C-terminal ATPase motifs themselves induce stabilization, as suggested by the fact that the hexamers of KaiCK294H and KaiCCatE2-, which showed lower KD values (higher affinity for ATP) than KaiCK53H and KaiCCatE1- (Fig. 2 and Table I), were unstable; and 4) The phosphorylation reaction (the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP bound to the C-terminal low affinity site to the recently identified phosphorylation sites (Ser431 and Thr432) 2F. Hayashi and M. Ishiura, unpublished data. in KaiC occurs in the C-terminal ATPase motifs. This mechanism would maintain the hexameric structure even if the ATP bound to the C-terminal domain of KaiC hexamer were hydrolyzed. The ATP-induced hexamerization of KaiC is crucial for the generation of clock oscillation, as evidenced by the almost complete disruption of circadian bioluminescence rhythms in vivo when the ATP binding site in the N-terminal Walker motif A was mutated (KaiCK53H in Fig. 3 and Table II). The stabilization and/or phosphorylation of KaiC hexamer may be involved in the regulation of the period length, phase, and amplitude of clock oscillations, but not in the generation of the oscillations, as evidenced by the unique and unstable circadian bioluminescence rhythms produced when the ATP-binding site in C-terminal Walker motif A was mutated (KaiCK294H in Figs. 4 and 5, and Table III). Although KaiCK294H and KaiCCatE2- showed similar characteristics in in vitro stabilization and hexamer phosphorylation (Table III and Figs. 4 and 5), the aberrant rhythms they expressed differed (Fig. 6), suggesting other unknown crucial biochemical functions. Although the contributions of the C-terminal CatEs to ATP binding and KaiC hexamerization were the lowest among the ATPase motifs we examined (Tables II and III and Figs. 2 and 3), mutations at those sites disrupted clock oscillation almost completely (Fig. 6), suggesting important but unidentified roles.

With the use of a sensitive PCR for the assay of two mononucleotide- and three dinucleotide microsatellite markers that exhibited instabilities in mismatch repair-deficient cells, significantly higher frequencies of instability were detected at three of the five markers in Dnmt1-/- ES than the wild-type ES. The data suggest that Dnmt1 enzyme plays an integrating role in DNA replication and/or repair. The implication that Dnmt1 enzyme and/or cytosine methylation may participate in the strand discrimination of mismatch repair during eukaryotic DNA replication is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2089959815,"Smad nuclear interacting protein 1 (SNIP1) is an evolutionarily conserved protein containing a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain that regulates gene expression through interactions with multiple transcriptional regulators. Here, we have used short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knockdown SNIP1 expression in human cell lines. Surprisingly, we found that reduction in SNIP1 levels resulted in significantly reduced cell proliferation and accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Consistent with this result, we observed that cyclin D1 protein and mRNA levels were reduced. Moreover, SNIP1 depletion results in inhibition of cyclin D1 promoter activity in a manner dependent upon a previously characterized binding site for the AP-1 transcription factor family. SNIP1 itself is induced upon serum stimulation immediately prior to cyclin D1 expression. These effects were independent of the tumour suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb), but were consistent with an interaction with BRG1, a component of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex, Swi/Snf. These results define both a new function for SNIP1 and identify a previously unrecognized regulator of the cell cycle and cyclin D1 expression."

The FA proteins have recently been found to functionally interact with the cell cycle regulatory proteins ATM and BRCA1; however, the function of the FA proteins in cell cycle control remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the Fanconi anemia complementation group C protein (Fancc) is necessary for proper function of the DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint in vitro and in vivo. Despite apparently normal induction of the G2/M checkpoint after ionizing radiation, murine and human cells lacking functional FANCC did not maintain the G2 checkpoint as compared with wild-type cells. The increased rate of mitotic entry seen in Fancc–/–mouse embryo fibroblasts correlated with decreased inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc2 kinase on tyrosine 15.

In contrast, genetic disruption of both Fancc and Atm did not cooperate in the G2 checkpoint. These data indicate that Fancc and p53 in separate pathways converge to regulate the G2 checkpoint. Finally, fibroblasts lacking FANCD2 were found to have a G2 checkpoint phenotype similar to FANCC-deficient cells, indicating that FANCD2, which is activated by the FA complex, was also required to maintain the G2 checkpoint.

To test the hypothesis that the FA proteins function in G2 checkpoint regulation, we measured the IR-induced G2 checkpoint in primary murine and human cells lacking functional FANCC using in vitro and in vivo analyses. We report that the G2 checkpoint was induced normally but not maintained in cells lacking functional FANCC (Fancc) after treatment with IR. Immortalized cells lacking FANCD2 exhibited a similar phenotype. The inability of cells to maintain the G2 checkpoint correlated with an inability to maintain tyrosine 15 phosphorylation on cdc2 despite apparently normal induction of the Atm/Chk2 pathway. Utilizing genetic intercrosses, we found that the G2 checkpoint defect in Atm–/–; Fancc–/–cells was similar to Atm–/–cells, whereas Fancc–/–; Trp53–/–cells had a more severe inability to maintain the G2 checkpoint compared with cells that were mutant at Fancc or Trp53 only. These data are consistent with Fancc functioning via a p53-independent mechanism to maintain the G2 checkpoint. These data have implications in understanding both the function of FA proteins and the mechanism of genomic instability in FA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Primary murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from day 12–14 mouse embryos derived from breeding of Fancc+/–mice. Embryos were obtained, and a small amount of tissue was saved for PCR analysis. Fibroblasts were derived by mincing embryos and culturing on tissue culture dishes in growth media consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 media containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). MEFs were maintained based on a 3T3 protocol (32Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). All experiments using MEFs were performed with cells that were less than passage 6. Primary human skin fibroblasts were isolated from two FA complementation group C patients and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. These cells were transduced with a retrovirus expressing FANCC (33Hanenberg H. Batish S.D. Pollok K.E. Vieten L. Verlander P.C. Leurs C. Cooper R.J. Gottsche K. Haneline L. Clapp D.W. Lobitz S. Williams D.A. Auerbach A.D. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 410-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and selected in G418. Both control and FANCD2-corrected immortalized fibroblasts from a FANCD2 patient (PD20 and PD20+FANCD2) were gifts of the Fanconi anemia foundation and were cultured the same as primary skin fibroblasts.Mouse Models—Mice harboring a disruption of the Fancc gene were generously provided by Dr. Manuel Buchwald (34Chen M. Tomkins D.J. Auerbach W. McKerlie C. Youssoufian H. Liu L. Gan O. Carreau M. Auerbach A. Groves T. Guidos C.J. Freedman M.H. Cross J. Percy D.H. Dick J.E. Joyner A.L. Buchwald M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These mice were backcrossed for 10 generations into the C57BL/6J strain. Mice were genotyped using PCR to detect wild-type and mutant Fancc alleles as described (35Haneline L.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Cooper S. Hangoc G. Carreau M. Buchwald M. Clapp D.W. Blood. 1998; 91: 4092-4098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice with the disrupted Atm allele have been previously described (36Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyanage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T. Tagle D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Cell. 1996; 86: 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar) and were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) in the 129 genetic background. Genotyping for Atm was carried using PCR primers as suggested by the vendor. These mice were crossed with Fancc mutant mice in the C57BL/6J strain to yield mice with a mixed genetic background. F2 embryos were generated by crossing Atm and Fancc double heterozygous animals, and MEFs were isolated from these embryos. Experiments comparing the Fancc and Atm genotypes to one another were carried out using MEF lines isolated from a common pregnant female. Mice harboring a disruption of the Trp53 gene have been previously described (37Jacks T. Remington L. Williams B.O. Schmitt E.M. Halachmi S. Bronson R.T. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar) and were obtained in the C57BL/6J strain from The Jackson Laboratory. Trp53 genotype was determined using a PCR method and primer sequences as provided by The Jackson Laboratory. Fancc and Trp53 compound heterozygous mice were generated by mating Fancc+/–mice with Trp53+/–mice. The F2 generation was produced by crossing the compound heterozygotes derived from the F1 mice.Treatment of Cells with IR and Mitotic Index Determination—For analyzing G2 progression of a defined S-phase population, cells were pulse-labeled with 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Cells were then treated with ionizing radiation using a Gammacell-40 exactor (Nordion) containing a 137Cs source and cultured for the indicated time period followed by analysis of BrdUrd incorporation. BrdUrd was detected using anti-BrdUrd FITC antibody (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, denatured (2 m HCl), and neutralized (0.1 m sodium borate). Cells were stained with anti-BrdUrd FITC antibody, then resuspended in 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For mitotic index determination, cells were cultured on tissue culture slides (Nunc), treated with IR, and incubated for the indicated time. Slides were fixed in 100% methanol containing 2 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenyldole (Sigma) and condensed, and mitotic nuclei were visualized and scored by fluorescent microscopy. For analysis of phosphorylated histone H3, MEFs of the appropriate genotypes were treated with 10 Gy of IR, cultured for the indicated time period, then trypsinized and fixed in 70% ethanol. After fixation cells were permeabilized (0.25% Triton X-100 on ice for 15 min), washed, and incubated for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.75 μg of phosphohistone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). After washing, cells were then incubated in secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse FITC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated in 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min and analyzed on a flow cytometer for FITC (FL-1) and propidium iodide (FL-2). For all cells analyzed, the G1 peak was standardized at a fluorescence intensity of 200 in FL-2.G2 Checkpoint Analysis in Keratinocytes—The analysis of the G2 checkpoint was carried out in vivo as previously described (38Hirao A. Cheung A. Duncan G. Girard P.M. Elia A.J. Wakeham A. Okada H. Sarkissian T. Wong J.A. Sakai T. De Stanchina E. Bristow R.G. Suda T. Lowe S.W. Jeggo P.A. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6521-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) by measuring the percent of mitotic cells in keratinocytes in syngeneic, 3–6-month-old age and sex-matched mice. Mice were irradiated with 5 Gy of IR and then allowed to recover for the given time period. Mice were then sacrificed, and skin was fixed in 10% formalin. Processing was performed for phosphohistone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), used at a 1:500 dilution. Approximately one mitotic event was scored in untreated keratinocytes per high power field.S-phase Checkpoint Analysis—Analysis of the IR-induced S phase checkpoint was carried out according to previously established methods. Fibroblasts were first labeled with [14C]thymidine (0.5 nCi/ml) for 36 h and washed, and cells were then cultured overnight. Cells were irradiated (20 Gy) and pulse-labeled for 15 min with [3H]thymidine at varying time periods after IR. Labeling was terminated (10% 2.3 m citric acid), cells were fixed (10% trichloroacetic acid), DNA was solubilized (0.2 m NaOH), and the solution was counted on a scintillation counter for both 14C and 3H.Immunoblotting—Whole cell protein extracts were obtained from cells in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and equivalent amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and detected by Western blotting using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used were cdc2 (C-19) polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Chk2 (clone 7) monoclonal (Upstate Biotechnology), and tyrosine 15 phospho-cdc2 (New England Biolabs).RESULTSMurine (Fancc) and Human (FANCC) Fibroblasts Have an Impaired IR-induced G2 Checkpoint—To test the hypothesis that the murine homologue (Fancc) of Fanconi anemia type C (FANCC) functions in G2 checkpoint control, the cell cycle kinetics of a defined population of primary Fancc–/–and Fancc+/+ MEFs were examined after treatment with ionizing radiation. We monitored the progression of a BrdUrd-labeled (S phase) population of cells through G2 and M phases of the cell cycle after IR treatment, similar to the methodology used previously (39Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 40Chen M.S. Hurov J. White L.S. Woodford-Thomas T. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3853-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for the indicated times and analyzed for simultaneous detection of BrdUrd and DNA content using flow cytometry (Fig. 1a). The pulsed cells were arrested with primarily 4n DNA content by 8 h after IR treatment in both genotypes. Although Fancc+/+ cells remained arrested in G2/M, the Fancc–/–cells began to exit G2/M, and a significant proportion of cells (30%) escaped from 4n arrest 12–16 h post-IR. The data are summarized in a graph depicting the results from three independently isolated MEF lines (Fig. 1b).To determine whether the checkpoint abnormality observed in Fancc null MEFs also occurred in human cells, FANCC mutant cutaneous fibroblasts were examined for G2 arrest after IR treatment. Fibroblasts from two FA patients with FANCC mutations were transduced with a retrovirus encoding the FANCC cDNA and neo or a retrovirus containing neo only. FANCC fibroblasts (control and FANCC-corrected) were treated with BrdUrd for 1 h, exposed to 5 Gy of IR, and cultured for up to 48 h (Fig. 1, c–d). In both patients the BrdUrd-labeled cells (both FANCC gene-corrected and FANCC mutant) were essentially arrested with 4n DNA content 8 h after IR. However, although most of the cells expressing recombinant FANCC maintained the arrest at 24 and 48 h post-IR, a much higher percentage of the patient fibroblasts expressing only neo exited G2 and mitosis into the subsequent cell cycle. These data demonstrate that a significant portion of cells lacking functional murine Fancc and human FANCC did not maintain cell cycle arrest at 4n compared with controls expressing functional FANCC.To further analyze the DNA damage-induced G2 checkpoint in Fancc–/–MEFs, we determined the mitotic index of murine Fancc+/+ and Fancc–/–cells after treatment with IR. Compared with Fancc+/+ cells, a significantly increased percentage of Fancc–/–cells were observed in mitosis after IR treatment (Fig. 2a). In human fibroblasts a similar reduction in mitotic index was observed after IR in the FANCC mutant cells expressing recombinant FANCC protein, whereas uncorrected FANCC mutant cells demonstrated a significantly higher rate of mitosis after IR treatment (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2Fancc–/–cells do not maintain the G2 checkpoint after IR treatment. a, Fancc mutant and wild-type MEFs (right panel) were treated with 10 Gy of IR and cultured for 12 h. Mitotic index was determined by scoring cells based on chromatin condensation. Approximately 1000 events were scored in triplicate before and after IR treatment by an investigator blinded to the genotypes. The y axis shows percent mitotic cells, and each genotype is indicated below the graphs. b, human FANCC mutant cells expressing recombinant FANCC or neo were treated with 5 Gy of IR and cultured for 48 h. Mitotic index (y axis) was scored. c, cells were treated with IR (10 Gy) and cultured for the indicated period of time. Mitotic index (at least 3000 cells per data point) was scored (by chromatin condensation) in triplicate. The data are shown as the mean (±S.E.) percent mitotic index (y axis) as a function of time (x axis). A representative of three experiments with similar results is shown. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test. d, a representative analysis of cells analyzed for phospho-histone H3 staining. Cells were cultured after treatment with IR, fixed, and stained with antibody and propidium iodide (PI). The stained cells were then subjected to bivariate analysis for phosphohistone H3 in FITC (FL-1) and PI (FL-2) on a flow cytometer. e, P-H3 analysis of cells cultured for various times after IR treatment. Cells were prepared and analyzed as in d and are represented graphically as the mean percent of control phosphohistone H3 ± S.E. of three independently performed experiments. Percent of control untreated cells is represented on the y axis, and time following IR treatment is shown on the x axis. Statistical analysis was carried out using a paired t test.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), we tested whether Fancc is important for initiating or maintaining the G2 checkpoint. Mitotic index was assessed as a function of time after treatment of Fancc+/+ and Fancc–/–cells with IR by microscopy (Fig. 2c) and by analysis of phosphorylated histone H3 (Fig. 2, d–e), which specifically occurs during mitosis (43Juan G.

Although Fancc–/–cells demonstrated normal induction of the G2 checkpoint, they began to exit G2 and enter mitosis between 4 and 6 h after IR, indicating a relative inability to maintain the G2 checkpoint as compared with Fancc+/+ cells.To test whether the G2 checkpoint was functional in Fancc–/–cells in vivo, we compared the induction and maintenance of G2 in keratinocytes from irradiated Fancc+/+ and Fancc–/–mice. Histologic sections of skin from the irradiated mice were processed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry for phosphohistone H3 (38Hirao A. Cheung A. Duncan G. Girard P.M. Elia A.J. Wakeham A.

In contrast, although a reduction in mitotic cells was observed in Fancc–/–cells 6 h after IR treatment, the percentage of mitotic cells had increased to untreated levels in Fancc–/–skin sections by 24 h after treatment. Overall these data indicate that in primary cells Fancc is dispensable for initiation but required for proper maintenance of the G2 checkpoint.Fig. 3Analysis of mitotic index by phosphohistone H3 determination in Fancc+/+ and Fancc–/–mice in vivo in keratinocytes.

Here we demonstrate in vitro formation of a nearly stoichiometric quaternary complex containing eIF1 and the minimal segments of eIF2β, eIF3c, and eIF5. In vivo, overexpression of eIF2 and tRNAMeti suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype of tif5-7A altering eIF5-CTD by increasing interaction of the mutant eIF5 with eIF2 by mass action and restoring its defective interaction with eIF3. By contrast, overexpression of eIF1 exacerbated the tif5-7A phenotype because eIF1 forms unusual inhibitory complexes with a hyperstoichiometric amount of eIF1. Formation of such complexes leads to increased GCN4 translation, independent of eIF2 phosphorylation (general control derepressed or Gcd– phenotype). We also provide biochemical evidence indicating that the association of eIF5-CTD with eIF2β strongly enhances its binding to eIF3c. Our results suggest strongly that MFC formation is an ordered event involving specific enhancement of eIF5-CTD binding to eIF3 on its binding to eIF2β. We propose that the primary function of eIF5-CTD is to serve as an assembly guide by rapidly promoting stoichiometric MFC assembly with the aid of eIF2 while excluding formation of nonfunctional complexes.

Subsequent joining of mRNA carried by eIF4F produces the 48 S preinitiation complex. The eIF3 stimulates recruitment of Met-tRNAMeti and mRNA to the 40 S ribosome (for a review, see Ref. 1Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The 48 S complex searches for the first AUG codon in the mRNA with the help of small factors eIF1 and eIF1A. Correct base pairing between the Met-tRNAMeti anticodon and the AUG codon triggers the hydrolysis of GTP bound to eIF2 by the action of the GTPase-activating protein eIF5, which then leads to dissociation of preassembled eIFs and formation of the 40 S initiation complex. The second GTP-binding protein eIF5B then stimulates joining of the 40 S initiation complex with the 60 S subunit to form the 80 S initiation complex. The elongation of the polypeptide chain starts from the methionine linked to the 80 S initiation complex. The GDP-bound eIF2 that is released after GTP hydrolysis and 80 S complex formation needs to be recycled to eIF2-GTP because only the GTP form of eIF2 can bind Met-tRNAMeti. This reaction is catalyzed by eIF2B, a five-subunit guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Substantial evidence indicates that the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of eIF5 serves as a core of ribosomal preinitiation complex formation (2Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G.

The eIF5-CTD binds eIF1, the c-subunit of eIF3, and eIF4G as well as the β-subunit of eIF2, the GTPase-activating protein substrate. Of these interactions, the eIF5-CTD binding to eIF1, eIF2β, and eIF3c has been shown to occur simultaneously (2Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G.

Mohammad S.S. Pavitt G.D. Andersen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10584-10592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although mutational studies indicate that eIF5-CTD plays a critical role in MFC formation in vivo (2Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 3Asano K. Shalev A. Phan L. Nielsen K. Clayton J. Valasek L. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2326-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), other lines of evidence indicate that direct interaction between eIF2 and eIF3, mediated by interaction between eIF2β and the CTD of the a-subunit of eIF3, is also important for MFC assembly (8Valásek L. Nielsen K.H. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5886-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). While it is natural to assume that many protein-protein interactions mediate such a multisubunit protein complex, it remains to be elucidated how these interactions are coordinately regulated. For instance, how are all these interactions resolved once the 48 S complex recognizes the AUG codon? In this study, we examined whether the temperature-sensitive (Ts–) phenotype caused by an eIF5-CTD mutation could be suppressed by overexpression of eIF1, eIF2 TC, or eIF3 by mass action. Interestingly the mutant phenotype was suppressed by overexpression of eIF2 TC but not by that of eIF3; furthermore it was exacerbated by eIF1 overexpression. Thus, increased interaction with any partner in the MFC does not always restore defective MFC assembly caused by the eIF5-CTD mutation. Rather the eIF2/eIF5 interaction is the most critical for the functional MFC assembly. These results strongly suggest that the entire assembly process is an ordered and highly coordinated event. In support of this idea, we show that the eIF5-CTD interaction with eIF2β K-box greatly enhances its binding to eIF3c. Based on these and other findings, we discuss how the ribosomal recruitment of the MFC constituents and their release on AUG recognition are coordinately controlled during the course of translation initiation. Plasmids and Yeast Strains—Plasmids and yeast strains used in this study are listed in Tables I and II, respectively. pKA758 encoding untagged tif5-7A was prepared by replacing the NdeI-SalI TIF5 open reading frame segment of YCp-TIF5 (13Asano K.

YEpU-eIF3all encoding all five core subunits of eIF3 (Tif32p, Nip1p, Prt1p-His, Tif34p-HA, and Tif35p-FL) on a high copy (hc) URA3 vector was constructed by subcloning the 7.5-kb DrdI-KasI fragment of pLPY-PRT1His-TIF34HA-TIF35Flag (7Phan L.

KAY128, KAY138, and KAY284 were constructed similarly using the KAY127 transformants carrying pKA234 (13Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G.

Materials—All the recombinant proteins used in this study were expressed in BL21(DE3) carrying corresponding plasmids. The solubility enhancement tag-fusion form of eIF5-CTD-(241–405) or its truncation (eIF5-CTD-(241–390)) designated GB-eIF5-B6 or -B6Δ, with carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine, were expressed and purified from pGB-TIF5-B6 or -B6Δ, respectively, dialyzed against GST pull-down binding buffer (see below) without milk, and stored at –80 °C as described previously (2Asano K.

The carboxyl-terminal FLAG-eIF1 and His6-tagged eIF3c-(1–156) and eIF2β-(1–140) fragments designated eIF1-FL, His-eIF3c-N, and His-eIF2β-N were expressed from pET-SUI-FL, pHis-NIP1-N, and pHis-SUI3ΔS and used for the Mini-MFC formation. GST fusion forms of eIF1 and the same segments of eIF5, eIF3, and eIF2β as above were expressed from pGEX-SUI1 (11He H. von der Haar T. Singh R.C. Ii M. Li B. McCarthy J.E.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Asano K.

GST-eIF5 (full length) and its tif5-7A and W391Δ derivatives were expressed from pGEX-TIF5, pGEX-TIF5-7A, and pGEX-TIF5Δ, respectively. Biochemical Assays—GST pull-down assays with 35S-labeled proteins, synthesized with the TnT/T7 system (Promega) in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, were conducted as described previously (19Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. The binding reaction was done in 100 μl of binding buffer (75 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1% skim milk, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100), and the protein complexes on the glutathione resin were washed with the binding buffer without milk. [35S]eIF1, [35S]eIF5-B5, [35S]eIF3c-N, and [35S]eIF2β-N were expressed from pT7-SUI1, pET-TIF5-B6, pHis-NIP1-N, and pHis-SUI3ΔS, respectively. The amounts of bound 35S-labeled proteins were quantitated by scanning the gel with STORM/TYPHOON (Amersham Biosciences). Apparent dissociation constants (KD) for protein interactions assayed in this manner were calculated from the equation: KD = G((1/f) – 1) where f is the fraction of 35S-protein bound to GST fusion protein and G is the molar concentration of GST fusion protein (11He H. von der Haar T. Singh R.C. Ii M. Li B. McCarthy J.E.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Asano K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5441-5445Google Scholar). This holds only when G » [35S-protein]. Obtained KD values were averaged from at least three sets of experiments using different amounts of GST fusion protein. GST pull-down assays with GB-eIF5-B6 or -B6Δ were done similarly with the same buffers (19Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Apparent KD values for these reactions were calculated precisely from initial concentrations of binding components and of the precipitated complex and averaged from independent experiments. In principle, KD measurement by GST pull-down can underestimate the real values due to the washing step of the reaction. We consistently observed a near hyperbolic interaction profile when GST fusion partners were present in excess, and the interaction reached a plateau at 30 to nearly 100% binding of the partners in trace amounts (see Fig. 5F for example). Therefore, the real KD values would be up to 3–4-fold smaller than the values assayed in this manner. The Mini-MFC was formed by incubating bacterial extracts (∼5 ml) containing 60 μg each of His-eIF3c-N, His-eIF2β-N, and eIF1-FL with 25 μg of GST-eIF5-B6 attached to glutathione resin (25-μl bed volume) in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1% Triton X-100. The complex on the resin was washed with the binding buffer (75 mm KCl without milk (19Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)), purified into an elution buffer (40 μl) containing glutathione (Amersham Biosciences), and repurified with anti-FLAG resin (40-μl bed volume) followed by elution with 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with FLAG peptides (125 μg/ml). The relatively low yield of Mini-MFC (∼2 μg from the above mentioned reaction) would be due to the presence of eIF1-FL (as the interaction of eIF1-FL with eIF3 in vitro and its incorporation into MFC in vivo were reduced although not abolished (6Singh R.C. Hui H. Ii M. Yamamoto Y. Asano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31910-31920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) and His-eIF3c-N and His-eIF2β-N (as only a part of the purified fractions were active enough to bind GST-eIF5-B6; however, 35S-labeled versions of these His-tagged proteins, synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, bound GST-eIF5-B6 as efficiently as full-length constructs, indicating that the modifications themselves do not affect the interactions). Coimmunoprecipitatoin of FLAG-tagged eIF5 or eIF2 and HA-tagged eIF3 was done as described previously (6Singh R.C. Hui H. Ii M. Yamamoto Y. Asano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31910-31920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Proteins in whole cell extracts (WCEs) (200 μg) were allowed to bind anti-HA (BabCO) resin in 300 μl of buffer A (100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5mm MgCl2, 7mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Triton X-100 in the binding reaction (and possibly other minor modifications) removed nonspecific binding observed with eIF5 perhaps by better solubilizing proteins in WCEs. This results in a greater reduction in HA-eIF3/eIF5 interaction by tif5-7A (see Figs. 3 and 7) than in similar experiments reported previously (3Asano K. Shalev A. Phan L. Nielsen K. Clayton J.

We previously identified a region-specific secretory glycoprotein (termed HEP64) of the hamster proximal cauda epididymidis that specifically bound and coated the nonviable, but not the viable, spermatozoa within the epididymal lumen. In this study we employed expression screening of a hamster epididymal cDNA library to obtain the full-length sequence of HEP64 and to identify it as the fibrinogen-like protein fgl2. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that fgl2 mRNA is highly expressed by the proximal cauda epididymidis in comparison to other hamster tissues examined, and, in situ hybridization analysis of the epididymis revealed that fgl2 mRNA exhibited a region- and principal cell-specific expression pattern. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the association of fgl2 with abnormal spermatozoa in the cauda epididymidis and revealed smaller fgl2-containing particles. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that fgl2 was distributed throughout an amorphous, “death cocoon,” complex assembled onto abnormal spermatozoa and that the smaller fgl2 aggregates consisted of the amorphous material with embedded sperm fragments, organelles, and membrane vesicles. A protocol was developed to isolate an enriched death cocoon fraction. SDS-PAGE and microsequence analyses revealed that the Mr 64,000 fgl2 monomer was assembled into two disulfide-linked oligomers of Mr 260,000 and 280,000. These data demonstrate that the epididymis possesses a specific mechanism to identify and envelop defective spermatozoa with a protein complex containing the fibrinogen-like protein fgl2. We propose that this represents an important protective mechanism not only to shield the viable sperm population from potentially deleterious enzymes released by dying spermatozoa but also to prevent the release of sperm proteins that could initiate an immune response if they escaped the epididymal environment.

Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that fgl2 was distributed throughout an amorphous, “death cocoon,” complex assembled onto abnormal spermatozoa and that the smaller fgl2 aggregates consisted of the amorphous material with embedded sperm fragments, organelles, and membrane vesicles. A protocol was developed to isolate an enriched death cocoon fraction. SDS-PAGE and microsequence analyses revealed that the Mr 64,000 fgl2 monomer was assembled into two disulfide-linked oligomers of Mr 260,000 and 280,000. These data demonstrate that the epididymis possesses a specific mechanism to identify and envelop defective spermatozoa with a protein complex containing the fibrinogen-like protein fgl2. We propose that this represents an important protective mechanism not only to shield the viable sperm population from potentially deleterious enzymes released by dying spermatozoa but also to prevent the release of sperm proteins that could initiate an immune response if they escaped the epididymal environment. Mammalian spermatozoa exiting the testis are functionally immature and must undergo a series of developmental modifications in the epididymis to acquire forward motility and fertilizing capacity (1Bedford J.M. Greep R.O. Astwood E.B. Handbook of Physiology: Endocrinology, Male Reproductive System. Waverly Press, Baltimore, MD1975: 303-317Google Scholar, 2Orgebin-Crist M.C. Danzo B.J. Davies J. Greep R.O. Astwood E.B. Handbook of Physiology: Endocrinology, Male Reproductive System. Waverly Press, Baltimore, MD1975: 319-338Google Scholar). In the species studied, spermatozoa from the proximal cauda epididymidis exhibit fertilizing capacity, and the distal cauda functions as a storage reservoir that maintains the viability of mature spermatozoa (1Bedford J.M. Greep R.O. Astwood E.B. Handbook of Physiology: Endocrinology, Male Reproductive System. Waverly Press, Baltimore, MD1975: 303-317Google Scholar, 3Jones R.C. Int. J. Androl. 1999; 22: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Both the sperm maturation and storage functions of the epididymis depend upon paracrine interactions between the epididymal epithelium and spermatozoa, which are mediated by a progressively modulated luminal fluid environment of region-specific ionic, organic solute, and protein composition (4Hinton B.T. Palladino M.A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 30: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Hinton B.T. Palladino M.A. Rudolph D. Lan Z.J. Labus J.C. Curr. Topics Dev. Biol. 1996; 33: 61-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The luminal fluid is produced by the secretory and absorptive activities of a lining epithelium whose major cell type, the principal cell, also displays striking regional differences in its gene expression and protein secretion patterns (6Kirchhoff C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 188: 133-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several principal cell secretory proteins appear to modify the sperm plasma membrane and promote their maturation (7Jones R. J. Reprod. Fert. Suppl. 1998; 53: 73-84PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kirchhoff C. Osterhoff C. Pera I. Schroter S. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, other principal cell secretory proteins such as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, which prevent oxidative damage, clusterin, a complement inhibitor (5Hinton B.T. Palladino M.A. Rudolph D. Lan Z.J. Labus J.C. Curr. Topics Dev. Biol. 1996; 33: 61-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bailey R. Griswold M.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and CRES (10Cornwall G.A. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Hann S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and HE4 (8Kirchhoff C. Osterhoff C. Pera I. Schroter S. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which are potential protease inhibitors, represent protective proteins thought to promote sperm viability (4Hinton B.T. Palladino M.A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 30: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Jervis K.M. Robaire B. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus the luminal environment performs a dual function, promoting sperm maturation in the proximal and sperm survival in the distal regions of the epididymis, respectively Although the cauda epididymidis promotes their survival, the presence of dead spermatozoa in this region has been observed in many species (12Simeone F.A. Young W.C. J. Exp. Biol. 1931; 8: 163-175Google Scholar, 13Glover T.D. Nature. 1961; 190: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 14Cooper T.G. Hamilton D.W. Am. J.

Androl. 1994; 17: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Degenerating spermatozoa release enzymes that may compromise the viability of neighboring cells and represent a source of autoantigens that could provoke an immune response if they escaped from the epididymal lumen. The protective strategies that the epididymis utilizes to prevent these negative impacts on male fertility are not clearly understood. We previously identified a 64-kDa polypeptide (termed HEP64) secreted by principal cells of the hamster cauda epididymidis that selectively binds to abnormal spermatozoa (16NagDas S.K. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1428-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study we have identified this polypeptide as the fibrinogen-related protein fgl2, which was originally identified as a T-lymphocyte gene product (17Koyama T. Hall L.R. Haser W.G. Tonegawa S. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and subsequently as a procoagulant protein expressed during specific tissue pathologies (18Ding J.W. Ning Q. Liu M.F. Lai A. Leibowitz J. Peltekian K.M. Cole E.H. Fung L.S. Holloway C. Marsden P.A. Yeger H. Phillips M.J. Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9223-9230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate that fgl2 is polymerized into a cocoon-like complex enveloping both sperm fragments and defective spermatozoa in the hamster cauda epididymidis. We propose that this polymerized complex physiologically separates the defective from the viable sperm population and prevents release of sperm components with potential adverse effects on male fertility. This model is compared with other concepts proposed for the elimination of defective spermatozoa. Animals—Care and use of animals conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines for humane animal care and use in research. Mature male golden hamsters were housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved animal facility and given free access to food and water. University veterinarians supervised animal care, and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and tissues were immediately removed for the protocols described below. Construction and Expression Screening of Epididymal cDNA Libraries—Hamster cauda epididymides were minced in ice-cold saline (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) to release spermatozoa and then frozen on dry ice. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted and isolated with two sequential loadings on an oligo(dT) column (Messenger RNA Isolation kit, Stratagene). A cauda epididymal unidirectional cDNA expression library was constructed in the ZAP express Lambda phage vector (Stratagene); cDNAs were size-selected on Sepharose CL-2B columns prior to ligation into the ZAP express vector. For expression screening, the cauda epididymal cDNA library was plated at 30,000 plaque-forming units/plate and incubated at 42 °C for 4 h. Nitrocellulose filters, treated with 10 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside, were layered on top of the plates that were then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The plates were cooled to 4 °C for 2 h, and the filters were removed for immunostaining. The filters were rinsed in TnT (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked in TnT containing 5% goat serum and 2.5% BSA. 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; Dig, digoxigenin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. The filters were then incubated in rabbit ant-fgl2 (16NagDas S.K. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1428-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in blocking solution and then in affinity-purified peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in blocking solution, and positive plaques were detected by color development with diaminobenzidine and H2O2. Plaques were excised, diluted 1:1000 in SM medium (0.1 m NaCl, 0.01 m MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml gelatin, and 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and replated for expression screening. After three rounds of purification, plaques were subjected to phage excision, and the phagemid cDNAs were sequenced (Vanderbilt DNA Sequencing Shared Resource). A total of 17 independent cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AY607779). BLAST sequence homology searches in GenBank™ and the determination of the open reading frame were performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base at the National Institutes of Health. Predictions of the putative secretory signal sequence were made online using SignalIP version 1.1 at the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalIP/) (19Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4934) Google Scholar). Potential O-glycosylation sites were determined using NetOGlyc 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/) (20Hansen J.E. Lund O. Engelbrecht J. Bohr H. Nielsen J.O. Hansen J.E.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 21Hansen J.E. Lund O. Rapacki K. Brunak S.

J. 1998; 15: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Motifs within the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein were determined by scanning a data base of signature motifs in PROSITE (www.hits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/PFSCAN/) (23Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Northern analysis was conducted using Me2SO-glyoxal RNA denaturation and agarose gel electrophoresis (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor University Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from hamster organs using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), quantified by absorbance at A260 and stored under ethanol at –20 °C. RNA samples (20 μg) and RNA size standards (Invitrogen) were denatured in 1.08 m deionized glyoxal, 54% (v/v) Me2SO, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) for 1 h at 50 °C and fractionated on 1.5% w/v agarose gels in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. RNA was transferred to a Duralon-UV nylon membrane (Stratagene) by capillary action with 20× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm Na3 citrate), and fixed by UV-cross-linking and baking for 1 h at 80 °C. The blots were de-glyoxalated by incubation in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 9.0) for 1 h at 65 °Cand then prehybridized in 100 ml of hybridization buffer (50% v/v deionized formamide, 5× SSC, 0.025 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 5% w/v SDS, 0.1% w/v BSA, 0.1% w/v Ficoll 400, 0.1% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.05% w/v salmon sperm DNA) for 1 h at 42 °C prior to addition of 50 mCi of [α-32P]dATP-labeled probes. The full-length fgl2 cDNA was excised from the plasmid with an EcoRI/XhoI double digest. This digest yields 2 fragments of 1.4 and 1.6 kb. Both fragments were gel-purified in agarose gels, extracted, and labeled using random primers, [α-32P]dATP, and exo- Klenow fragment (Prime-it II kit, Stratagene). Probes were purified from unincorporated nucleotides using Nuc-Trap columns (Stratagene). After hybridization (19 h), the blots were washed once with 2× SSC, 1% (w/v) SDS at 45 °C for 15 min; twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 45 °C for 15 min; and once with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 15 min at 60 °C. Labeled bands were detected either by autoradiography at –70 °C on Kodak BioMax MR film or using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Blots were then stripped of bound probe by washing for 5 min at 90 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and rehybridized (19 h), as described above, with a [α-32P]dATP-labeled probe for the constitutively expressed gene (625-bp fragment of CHO-B) encoding ribosomal protein S2 (25Harpold M.M. Evans R.M. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1979; 17: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).

Winfrey V.P. Matrisian P.E. NagDas S.K. Hoffman L.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 293: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were prepared using 1 μg of linearized plasmid in 20-μl transcription reactions containing 40–50 units of SP6 (Promega, Madison, WI) or T7 (New England Biolabs, Waverly, MA) polymerase, 1× transcription buffer, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 1 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, 0.65 mm UTP, and 0.35 mm Dig-UTP (Roche Applied Science). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed with a Chroma Spin-100 STE column (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and probes were stored at –75 °C. Dig-labeled riboprobes were denatured for 5 min at 80 °C and diluted in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 4× SSC, 1× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5 mg/ml heat-denatured herring sperm DNA, and 0.25 mg/ml yeast tRNA). Formaldehyde-fixed cryosections of the hamster epididymis were treated 5 min at room temperature in 5 μg/ml proteinase K in PBS, rinsed twice in PBS, acetylated 15 min at room temperature with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine buffer, pH 8.0, and hybridized overnight at 60 °C with Dig-riboprobes. The slides were rinsed at room temperature for 5 min each in 2× SSC followed by STE (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA), and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in STE containing 40 μg/ml RNase A. After hybridization the sections were sequentially washed for 5 min each with 2× SSC, 50% formamide at 60 °C, then at room temperature with 1× SSC, followed by 0.5× SSC; all wash solutions contained 10 mm mercaptoethanol and 1 mm EDTA. To detect hybridized riboprobes, the slides were rinsed in TN buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl), blocked 1 h in TN containing 2% horse serum and 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated 1 h in a 1:500 dilution of the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody in TN containing 1% sheep serum. Specimens were then sequentially rinsed in TN buffer followed by substrate buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05 m MgCl2), and color was developed in substrate buffer containing 0.34 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium, 0.17 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 10 mmN-ethylmalemide and 1 mm levamisole to inhibit endogenous alkaline phosphatase. Color development was stopped with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA, and specimens were mounted in Aquamount. Isolation of a fgl2-enriched Fraction from the Cauda Epididymidal Luminal Contents—Sperm suspensions were prepared by mincing freshly dissected cauda epididymides in calcium-free Tyrode's solution containing 0.5 mm EGTA and 2 mm benzamidine. Aliquots of the sperm suspension (6 ml) were layered over an isotonic discontinuous Percoll gradient composed of 2 ml of 20% Percoll and 2 ml of 40% Percoll in Tyrode's solution. The gradients were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. The particulate fraction that layered on top of the 20% Percoll was collected, diluted with ice-cold Tyrode's solution, and then sedimented at 100,000 × g for 60 min in a Beckman SW41 rotor. The pelleted material was utilized for immunocytochemistry and SDS-PAGE. Because HEP64 was originally identified as a contaminant of a sperm acrosomal fraction (16NagDas S.K. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1428-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), cauda sperm suspensions were also used to prepare an enriched acrosomal fraction as previously described (28Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. Davenport G.R. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. NagDas S.K. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 61: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Sperm suspensions and cryosections of fresh-frozen epididymides were fixed for 15–30 min at 4 °C with 4% formaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, rinsed in TnT (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween 20), blocked in TnT containing 5% normal donkey serum and 2.5% BSA, and then incubated in rabbit anti-hamster fgl2 or preimmune rabbit serum diluted 1:500–1:2,500 in blocking solution. Specimens for immunofluorescence were then incubated in an affinity-purified CY3-donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted in blocking solution. For enzymatic detection on cryosections, an affinity-purified peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was utilized as a secondary antibody, and color was developed with diaminobenzidine and H2O2; sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin. In some experiments cryosections were subjected to antigen retrieval immediately following formaldehyde fixation; sections were incubated at 95 °C for 30 min in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and then processed as described above. Electron Microscopy—For post-embedding immunolabeling, spermatozoa were fixed at 4 °C with 4% formaldehyde, 0.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, dehydrated through an ethanol series, and embedded in LR White resin. Thin sections were mounted on nickel grids, blocked in Tris-saline (0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 2.5% BSA, 5% goat serum, 0.1% fish gelatin, and then incubated in 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-fgl2 or, for controls, nonimmune serum diluted in blocking solution for approximately 1 h. After three rinses in blocking solution, the grids were incubated for 1 h in 10-nm gold-conjugated, affinity-purified, goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). The sections were then rinsed in PBS, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, rinsed in H2O, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Pre-embedding immunogold labeling of formaldehyde-fixed spermatozoa with rabbit anti-fgl2 was performed as described previously (16NagDas S.K. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1428-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Specimens for routine electron microscopy were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and embedded in Embed 812. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) on high porosity 3–19% linear gradient separation gels prepared with a 30:0.4 acrylamide:piperazine diacrylamide ratio or on 7–15% linear gradient gels prepared with a 30:0.8 acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio. Protein loads were estimated by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Polypeptides were either stained with Coomassie Blue (32Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar) or electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar) for immunoblot analysis or for N terminus sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 475S sequencer (Foster City, PA). Immunoblots were blocked with PBS (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6) containing 0.1% Tween 20, 5% goat serum, 5% nonfat dry milk, and 2.5% BSA and then incubated with rabbit anti-fgl2 (16NagDas S.K. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1428-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or nonimmune serum diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% goat serum (PBS-GS). After three washes in PBS-GS, the blots were incubated in an affinity-purified peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG secondary antibody (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) diluted in PBS-GS; following several PBS washes immunoreactive bands were visualized either by color development with diaminobenzidine and H2O2 or by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal (Pierce) and detection on Kodak BioMax film. Identification of Hamster Epididymal fgl2 by Expression Cloning—A rabbit polyclonal antibody, prepared against a 64-kDa hamster epididymal glycoprotein (HEP64) that binds defective spermatozoa (16NagDas S.K. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1428-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was utilized for expression screening of a hamster cauda epididymal cDNA library. Seventeen independent clones were obtained and sequenced; all represented the hamster ortholog of human and mouse fgl2, a fibrinogen-related protein with putative procoagulant protease activity (18Ding J.W. Ning Q. Liu M.F. Lai A. Leibowitz J. Peltekian K.M. Cole E.H. Fung L.S. Holloway C. Marsden P.A. Yeger H. Phillips M.J. Levy G.A. J.

Ding J.W. Liu M. Marsden P.A. Levy G.A. Genomics. 2001; 71: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The 2946-bp cDNA encoding the full-length hamster fgl2 protein is shown in Fig. 1. The full-length protein is 430 amino acid residues in length and possesses a predicted signal peptide of 22 amino acid residues. The deduced molecular weight of the processed 408 amino acid containing polypeptide was 46,142, in close agreement to the reported molecular weight of 52,000 for deglycosylated HEP64 (16NagDas S.K. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1428-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and its theoretical pI was 7.95. Epididymal fgl2 possesses one predicted O-linked glycosylation site at threonine 199 and five consensus motifs for N-linked glycosylation. A fibrinogen β- and γ-chain C-terminal signature domain was identified, which encompasses amino acids 348–360 of the processed fgl2 protein. The hamster fgl2 amino acid sequence possesses 88.7% identity to mouse (17Koyama T. Hall L.R. Haser W.G. Tonegawa S. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and 77.7% identity to human fgl2 (35Yuwaraj S. Ding J.W. Liu M. Marsden P.A. Levy G.A. Genomics. 2001; 71: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Ruegg C. Pytela R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the previously identified epididymal secretory glycoprotein HEP64 (16NagDas S.K. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1428-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) represents epididymal fgl2. Northern Blot Analysis of fgl2 Expression in Hamster Organs—Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from several hamster organs demonstrated that the highest fgl2 mRNA expression was detected in the proximal and distal cauda epididymides and that each exhibited a single transcript of ∼3 kb. Only a low level of fgl2 mRNA was detected in the caput epididymidis, indicating region-specific fgl2 expression. Among other hamster tissues tested, the second highest expression level of fgl2 mRNA was detected in the spleen, and all other tissues displayed only very low expression levels of fgl2 mRNA (Fig. 2). All RNA samples exhibited similar levels of hybridization to the constitutive probe for ribosomal protein S2 demonstrating equivalent RNA loads in each lane (Fig. 2). In Situ Hybridization Demonstration of Region-specific Epididymal fgl2 Expression—Cryosections of the caput and cauda epididymides were hybridized with antisense Dig-labeled fgl2 riboprobes to identify the cell- and region-specific fgl2 mRNA expression. No fgl2 expression was detected in the proximal caput epididymidis (Fig. 3a), but low expression was apparent in principal cells of the distal caput epididymis (Fig. 3b). Highest expression of fgl2 mRNA was seen in the proximal cauda epididymidis and localized to the basal region of the principal cells (Fig. 3, c–e). No fgl2 expression was detected in peritubular or connective tissue cells. Adjacent lobules of the epididymis are separated by prominent connective tissue partitions, and the lobule immediately anterior to the proximal cauda epididymidis exhibited a decreased fgl2 mRNA expression in principal cells (Fig. 3c). Likewise, the distal cauda is separated from the proximal cauda by a connective tissue septum, and it is distinguished by an increased tubule diameter and reduced epithelial cell height. Compared with the proximal cauda, the principal cells of the distal cauda region also express significant, but reduced, levels of fgl2 mRNA (Fig. 3e). Control sections hybridized with sense Dig-labeled fgl2 riboprobes exhibited no detectable staining in any epididymal segment (Fig. 3f). These data demonstrate that fgl2 mRNA expression is both region- and principal cell-specific in the hamster epididymis. Epididymal fgl2 Localization and Association with Defective Spermatozoa—Immunohistochemical staining of epididymal cryosections using anti-hamster fgl2 revealed a region- and cell-specific expression pattern identical to that detected for fgl2 mRNA by in situ hybridization. Principal cells of the proximal cauda epididymis displayed a strong staining of the Golgi region (Fig. 4a). In addition focal accumulations of fgl2-positive material were apparent in the epididymal lumen (Fig. 4, a and b) that ranged in size from large sperm aggregates to small particulate elements (Fig. 4b). Parallel sections stained with preimmune serum exhibited no staining of the epididymal epithelium or lumen (Fig. 4c). Immunofluorescence analysis of cauda sperm suspensions revealed the association of fgl2 with specific domains of abnormal spermatozoa as reported previo"

The t(8;21) translocation gene product led to the discovery of the Eight Twenty-One (ETO) gene. When fused to RUNX1, ETO is thought to mediate the formation of a repressive complex at RUNX1-dependent genes. ETO has also been found to act as a co-repressor of the promyelocytic zinc finger and Bcl-6 oncoproteins, suggesting that it may play a common role as a transcriptional co-repressor leading to human disease. An analysis of ETO-mediated repression revealed that one of the key binding partners of ETO is the nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR). It is shown that two highly conserved domains of ETO interact with repression domains I and III of N-CoR. One of the ETO domains displays significant homology to Drosophila TAFII110, whereas the other is a predicted zinc binding motif that engages a conserved PPLXP motif in repression domain III of N-CoR. Together, these domains of ETO cooperate in repression with N-CoR and the binding sites in N-CoR overlap with those for other repressive factors. Thus, ETO has the potential to participate in a number of repressive complexes, which can be distinguished by their binding partners and target genes.

The ability of cells to adjust to different internal and external signals is crucial in development, growth, and homeostasis of organisms (1Jordan J.D. Landau E.M. Iyengar R.

One level of this regulation takes place in the nucleus where transcription factors are recruited to their target genes through direct interaction with their cognate DNA-binding sequences.

Spontaneous translocation fuses a portion of the gene encoding the DNA-binding Runt domain of RUNX1 (acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1), polyoma enhancer-binding protein αB, and core binding factor A2) inframe with all but 18 nucleotides of the ETO gene, resulting in the AML1-ETO fusion protein with new transcriptional properties. This fusion protein is expressed in 12% human AML of the M2-subtype (16Miyoshi H. Kozu T. Shimizu K. Enomoto K. Maseki N. Kaneko Y. Kamada N. Ohki M.

Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and overexpression of the Xenopus ETO homolog XETOR suggests a role for ETO in neuronal development (27Cao Y. Zhao H. Grunz H. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ETO has been shown to act as a co-repressor for the promyelocytic zinc finger protein (23Melnick A.M. Westendorf J.J. Polinger A. Carlile G.W. Arai S. Ball H.J. Lutterbach B. Hiebert S.W. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell.

Sacchi N. Liu J.M. Ross C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). ETO can also act as a co-repressor for the Bcl-6 oncoprotein, indicative of a role in hematopoiesis (30Chevallier N. Corcoran C.M. Lennon C. Haijek E. Chadburn A. Bardwell V.J. Licht J.D. Melnick A. Blood. 2003; 103: 1455-1463Google Scholar). Because ETO is thought to interact with N-CoR, the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), Sin3, and HDACs 1, 2, and 3 (19Amann J.M. Nip J. Strom D.K. Lutterbach B.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10860-10865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), it might act as a scaffold protein for different co-repressor complexes. Thus, the fusion of the RUNX1 Runt domain to ETO would be predicted to suppress gene expression by delivering co-repressor proteins to RUNX1-dependent genes via direct interaction with ETO. To elucidate the action of ETO in development and disease, a detailed analysis of repression by ETO and its subfragments has been conducted and the interaction with N-CoR has been defined. Two distinct conserved regions of ETO have been found to interact with different repression domains of N-CoR. One of these segments is a conserved domain with significant homology to Drosophila TAFII110 that interacts with repression domain I (RI) of N-CoR. A separate segment related to Drosophila protein Nervy interacts with the third repression domain of N-CoR (RIII), a region of N-CoR that is shown in this study to have a conserved PPLXP binding motif for co-repressor proteins. These the regions of ETO bind separately and additively with N-CoR to mediate transcriptional repression. Plasmid and Cells—If not otherwise indicated, cloning was performed using PCR amplification with primer-introducing restriction sites. Expression plasmids for Gal4-ETO fusion proteins were generated by cloning in-frame to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain into the pBind Vector (Promega) using SacI and NotI restriction sites. Single amino acid changes were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis strategy (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For in vitro transcription/translation, the gene encoding N-CoR or ETO or its subdomains was inserted into pET-21 or pET-28b (Novagen). For expression in mammalian cells, the reading frames were inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). HEK-293 (CRL-1573, ATCC) and CV-1 (CCL-70, ATCC) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Transfection Assay—A reporter vector containing five Gal4 DNA-binding domain-binding sites linked 5′ to the Herpesvirus thymidine kinase (tk) promoter, and the firefly luciferase gene (5×Gal4-tk-luc) was used. As an internal control, a plasmid coding for β-galactosidase was co-transfected. Cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Transcriptional activity was determined 48 h after transfection using a luciferase assay (Promega) and a tube luminometer (Berthold). Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as relative light units or fold repression of the normalized luciferase activity. In Vitro Protein Interaction Assay—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed using pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 strain, and single colonies were expanded and grown at 37 °C to an A620 of 0.8 and subsequently induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After overnight growth at 20 °C, the cell pellet was collected and the GST protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. 35S-Labeled proteins were produced by coupled in vitro transcription/translation in the presence of [35S]Met (with or without [35S]Cys as stated) using the rabbit reticulocyte TnT kit (Promega). Equal amounts of GST fusion protein were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated with 10 μl of TnT reaction mixture in 300 μl of pull-down buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 nm ZnSO4) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed four times using pull-down buffer. Afterward, the proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 20 μl of SDS loading dye and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was Coomassie Blue-stained for 20 min to check for equal protein loading. Subsequently, the gel was dried and analyzed after 24 h using a phosphorimaging screen. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL (Sigma), 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.01% SDS, protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Antibody was added to the supernatant (anti-ETO sc-9737, anti-Myc 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated for 30 min. The sample was diluted 2-fold with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL), and 20 μl of protein G magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) were added and incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C with nutation. The beads were washed twice with washing buffer and resuspended in 20 μl of SDS loading dye, boiled for 2 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For Western blot to detect transfected Gal4 constructs, the cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and SDS was added to a concentration of 0.5%. The cell extract was sonicated until it was no longer viscous and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) at 50 V for 2 h. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with CaseinBlocker (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 22 °C or overnight at 4 °C when the anti Gal4 antibody (sc-577, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. Afterward, the membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% IGEPAL. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody and washed as described above. The blots were developed using SuperSignalWest (34079, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The N-terminal and the C-terminal Halves of ETO Mediate Transcriptional Repression—The human ETO gene family consists of three members, each of which contains four regions that display significant amino acid sequence similarity to Drosophila Nervy (Fig. 1) (31Licht J.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5660-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Wolford J.K. Prochazka M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nervy homology domain I (NHR1) is closely related in amino acid sequence to human TAFII130 and human TAFII105 and Drosophila TAFII110 (17Erickson P.F. Robinson M. Owens G. Drabkin H.A.

Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as well as heterodimerization with other ETO family members (34Kitabayashi I. Ida K.

Biol. 1998; 18: 846-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and contributes to the interaction with the co-repressor Sin3 and to the HDACs (25Zhang J. Hug B.A. Huang E.Y. Chen C.W. Gelmetti V. Maccarana M. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). NHR3 interacts with the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase protein kinase II (35Fukuyama T. Sueoka E. Sugio Y. Otsuka T. Niho Y. Akagi K. Kozu T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6225-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). NHR4 contains a MYND-type (MTG8, Nervy, Deformed) zinc binding motif common to ETO and the Drosophila proteins Nervy and Deformed. The MYND motif is necessary but not sufficient for interaction with the transcriptional co-repressors N-CoR and SMRT (24Wang J. Hoshino T. Redner R.L. Kajigaya S. Liu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9889-9895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). NHR3 and NHR4 are thought to be simultaneously required for interaction with N-CoR (36Hildebrand D. Tiefenbach J. Heinzel T. Grez M. Maurer A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9889-9895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recent data also implicate a region N-terminal to NHR2 as also mediating an interaction with N-CoR (19Amann J.M. Nip J. Strom D.K. Lutterbach B. Harada H. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6470-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To determine the domains of ETO that are responsible for mediating transcriptional repression, ETO was deconstructed and the capacity for ETO and its subfragments to repress transcription from a luciferase reporter was assessed. Both the N-terminal 305 amino acids (ETO-N, residues 1–305) and the C-terminal 304 amino acids of the protein (ETO-C, residues 300–604, see Fig. 1A) could individually suppress transcription from the reporter in green monkey CV-1 cells and HEK-293 cells. Full-length ETO repressed the reporter gene expression 10-fold in CV-1 cells, whereas the N- and C-terminal deletion fragments repressed expression 2- and 5-fold, respectively (Fig. 1B, left). This finding suggests that the overall repressive effect may be a sum of repressive events mediated by the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein. Similar levels of repression were observed for these ETO constructs in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1B, right), suggesting that repression mediated by ETO in these two cells lines may occur by the same mechanism. As an expression control, a Western blot against the Gal4 part of the fusion protein was performed. Fig. 1B demonstrates that the repressive effect of ETO-N and ETO-C were not influenced by a higher level of expression by either half of ETO relative to the wild type. Thus, both halves of ETO possess repressive activity. Two Domains of ETO Bind to the Co-repressor N-CoR—To investigate the origin of the repressive effect mediated by ETO, the ability of N-CoR to interact with ETO and its subfragments was analyzed. A GST fusion protein of full-length ETO was used as bait in a GST pull-down assay with the in vitro translated 35S-labeled N-CoR or its subdomains. An N-terminal fragment of N-CoR (N-CoR-N, residues 1–1507) interacted with GST-ETO, whereas a C-terminal deletion mutant encompassing residues 1300–2453 (N-CoR-C) did not (Fig. 2B). The interaction between ETO and N-CoR-N was further dissected with the N- and C-terminal deletions of ETO, revealing that ETO-N interacts with the N-CoR repression domain I (RI, residues 1–407) and that the C-terminal NHR3 and NHR4 domains of ETO (NHR3/4, residues 439–563) bind RIII (residues 950–1507). An intermediate fragment of N-CoR-spanning residues 400–1040 did not interact with either fragment of ETO (Fig. 2C). Further analysis reduced these N-CoR fragments to 125–150 amino acids each (Fig. 2D). These interactions could be reproduced in a reciprocal experiment using GST fusion proteins of N-CoR (N-CoR-(1–407) or N-CoR-(950–1275)) as bait for the interaction with 35S-labeled full-length ETO (data not shown). Deletion analysis of ETO delineated two conserved regions as being responsible for the observed protein-protein interaction with N-CoR (Fig. 3A). One region involves the NHR1 domain, and a second region involves both NHR3 and NHR4 (Fig. 3, B and C). These regions of ETO interact with RI and RIII of N-CoR, respectively. To test whether the identified interactions can also take place within mammalian cells, immunoprecipitation assays were performed using transiently transfected HEK-293 cells. A minimal RI (N-CoR-(254–407)) or RIII (N-CoR-(950–1275)) fragment of N-CoR was Myctagged and shown to co-precipitate with co-expressed AML1-ETO (Fig. 3D), although co-precipitation of the minimal RI fragment was significantly weaker. These results confirmed that the interaction of N-CoR RI and RIII with ETO observed in vitro resembles the interactions that can occur between these proteins in a cell. Repressor Domain I of N-CoR Synergizes with ETO to Mediate Repression—Gal4 fusions of N-CoR RI (residues 1–407) were tested for their ability to synergize with ETO to repress transcription from a luciferase reporter. An overall 21-fold repression of the 5×Gal4-tk-luc reporter gene was observed with increasing N-CoR RI expression (see Western blot in Fig. 4A), indicating that RI can actively repress transcription (Fig. 4A). When co-expressed with ETO, the level of repression of the reporter gene was synergistically enhanced because we observed the same level of repression by RI when one-third as much expression vector was co-transfected with ETO (Fig. 4B). ETO alone had no repressive effect on the reporter in this experiment (Fig. 4B). RI also contains one of two putative Sin3 interaction domains of N-CoR (SID1) (37Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), and co-expression of Sin3 with this fragment resulted in the same level of repression as co-expression with ETO (Fig. 4B). Sin3 and ETO appear to complement one another, achieving the same level of repression when both proteins are co-expressed with RI (Fig. 4B). This finding suggests that there is no competition between ETO and Sin3 for a common binding site on RI. It is possible that N-CoR, Sin3, and ETO actually cooperate at this site. Repression Domain III of N-CoR Contains a Conserved Binding Motif for ETO—A number of co-repressor proteins appeared to contain a common motif with a core amino acid sequence of PPLXP (Fig. 5) (38Sims R.J. II I Weihe E.K. Zhu L. O'Malley S. Harriss J.V. Gottlieb P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26524-26529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An examination of the N-CoR RIII amino acid sequence suggested that it too contained this conserved interaction motif (Fig. 5A). To test whether this motif of N-CoR mediated, in part, the interaction with ETO, the central Leu of PPLXP was mutated to Ala, resulting in the loss of an interaction between RIII and ETO NHR3/4 in a pull-down assay (Fig. 5). Mutation in the first proline but not the second or third proline within the motif also resulted in the loss of binding. The functional significance of the PPLXP motif was further probed by an expression vector for a Gal4 fusion with N-CoR RIII or RIII harboring the Leu-to-Ala mutation. Co-transfection with the 5×Gal4-tk-luc reporter gene into CV-1 cells revealed that RIII repressed the activity of the reporter gene 10-fold at a high concentration of transfected expression vector whether or not the Leu-to-Ala mutation was present (Fig. 6A). This finding suggested that the properties and expression levels of both constructs were similar, which could also be shown by Western blot using an anti-Gal4 antibody (Fig. 6A).Fig. 6ETO and N-CoR RIII cooperate in repression in a PPLXP-dependent manner. A, N-CoR RIII and N-CoR RIII harboring the Leu-to-Ala mutation (L-A) in PPLXP similarly repress the Gal4-tk-luc reporter. The repression roughly represents the amount of expressed protein as was tested by Western blot using the anti-Gal4 antibody. B, co-expression of Gal4 N-CoR RIII with ETO enhances repression of the reporter gene compared with the value observed with the empty vector. The extent of N-CoR RIII synergy with ETO is reduced when N-CoR RIII is co-expressed with the Gal4 N-CoR RIII (L-A) mutant. This finding suggests that the PPLXP motif plays a significant role in the interaction between N-CoR and ETO. Values are given in fold repression compared with the values observed with the empty vector. The total DNA amount was adjusted with empty vector to 400 ng of DNA/transfection. Error bars represent the ± S.D. of three independent experiments. All of the values are normalized to β-galactosidase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Co-expression of RIII with ETO enhanced the repressive effect of RIII, which was diminished by the Leu-to-Ala mutation (Fig. 6B). This finding suggested that cooperation between ETO and N-CoR was dependent on a direct interaction between the PPLXP motif and N-CoR. The Zinc Binding Motif of ETO NHR4 Mediates the Interaction with RIII—ETO NHR4 contained a predicted double zinc finger motif that was shown to be essential for interaction with the N-CoR co-repressor (22Lutterbach B.

https://openalex.org/W2081001001,"The CCAAT displacement protein/Cut homeobox (CDP/Cux) transcription factor is expressed as multiple isoforms that may contain up to four DNA-binding domains: Cut repeats 1, 2, and 3 (CR1, CR2, CR3) and the Cut homeodomain (HD). The full-length protein, which contains all four DNA-binding domains, is surprisingly less efficient than the shorter isoforms in DNA binding. Using a panel of recombinant proteins expressed in mammalian or bacterial cells, we have identified a domain at the extreme N terminus of the protein that can inhibit DNA binding. This domain was able to inhibit the activity of full-length CDP/Cux and of proteins containing various combinations of DNA-binding domains: CR1CR2, CR3HD, or CR2CR3HD. Since inhibition of DNA binding was also observed with purified proteins obtained from bacteria, we conclude that autoinhibition does not require post-translational modification or interaction with an interacting protein but instead functions through an intramolecular mechanism. Antibodies directed against the N-terminal region were able to partially relieve inhibition. In vivo, the transition between the inactive and active states for DNA binding is likely to be governed by posttranslational modifications and/or interaction with one or more protein partners. In addition, we show that the relief of autoinhibition can be accomplished via the proteolytic processing of CDP/Cux.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The founding member of this family, the Drosophila melanogaster cut gene, takes its name from the phenotype of a viable mutant that harbored truncated (“cut”) wings (2Blanc R. Univ. Calif. Publ.

Other mutations within the cut locus are associated with defects in multiple tissues and often cause a switch in cell type identity (6Bodmer R. Barbel S. Shepherd S. Jack J.W. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

A “CCAAT displacement activity” was originally described as an activity present in the nuclear extracts of various types of cells that would prevent the binding of a transcriptional activator to a CCAAT motif (11Superti-Furga G. Barberis A. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3099-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Barberis A. Superti-Furga G. Busslinger M.

We use the term CDP/Cux to refer to the mammalian proteins in general, whereas CDP and Cux designate the human and mouse protein, respectively. The cux-1 knockout mice displayed phenotypes in various organs including curly whiskers, growth retardation, delayed differentiation of lung epithelia, altered hair follicle morphogenesis, male infertility, a deficit in T and B cells, and a surplus of myeloid cells (19Ellis T.

In contrast to the small size of the cux-1 knock-out mice, transgenic mice expressing Cux-1 under the control of the cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter displayed multiorgan hyperplasia and organomegaly (23Ledford A.W.

CDP/Cux was found to function in precursor cells of various lineages as a transcriptional repressor that down-modulates genes which later become expressed in terminally differentiated cells (13Skalnik D.G.

This function was ascribed to the ability of CDP/Cux to prevent the interaction of various transcriptional activators with their binding sites, probably via its CCAAT displacement activity (27Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18203-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol.

This type of repression, competition for binding site occupancy, is sometimes referred to as “passive repression,” as opposed to the mechanism of “active repression” whereby a distinct protein domain can down-modulate transcription by other means. The C-terminal domain of CDP/Cux was found to contain two active repression domains that, in a Gal4 reporter assay, were able to repress transcription at a distance from the factor binding site (29Mailly F. Berube G. Harada R. Mao P.L. Phillips S. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5346-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain was later shown to recruit the HDAC1 deacetylase (30Li S. Moy L. Pittman N. Shue G. Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7803-7815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, CDP/Cux has the potential to repress transcription by two mechanisms, competition for binding site occupancy and active repression (27Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18203-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Mailly F. Berube G. Harada R. Mao P.L. Phillips S. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5346-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, recent findings indicated that CDP/Cux is able to participate in the transcriptional activation of specific promoters (31Truscott M. Raynal L. Premdas P. Goulet B. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3013-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One of the most fascinating features of CDP/Cux proteins is that they contain up to four evolutionarily conserved DNA-binding domains: three Cut repeats (CR1, CR2, and CR3) and a Cut homeodomain (HD) (15Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 32Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(Noisy-Le-Grand). 1999; 45: 1149-1160PubMed Google Scholar), individual Cut repeats cannot bind to DNA on their own but need to cooperate with a second Cut repeat or with the Cut homeodomain (28Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In vitro DNA binding studies revealed that CR1CR2 makes a rapid but transient interaction with DNA, whereas CR2CR3HD and CR3HD bind more slowly, but stably, to DNA (28Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These combinations of domains also exhibited different DNA binding specificities. Although fusion proteins that included the Cut homeodomain displayed preference for the ATCRAT motif (where r = A or G), the CR1CR2 domains bound better to sequences including two CRAT motifs positioned in either orientation and at various distances from one another (28Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, CDP/Cux contains several DNA-binding domains that, in various combinations, can carry distinct DNA binding activities. In cells, three major CDP/Cux isoforms have been described so far. The full-length protein, which we refer to as CDP/Cux p200, contains all four DNA-binding domains but displays DNA binding activities similar to those of CR1CR2 (37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). DNA binding by CR3HD appears to be inhibited in the context of the full-length protein. At the G1/S transition of the cell cycle, CDP/Cux p200 is proteolytically processed by cathepsin L to generate the CDP/Cux p110 isoform, which contains three DNA-binding domains, CR2, CR3, and HD (37Moon N.S.

In addition, two alternate, tissue-specific mRNA species were found to code for a CDP/Cux p75 isoform that contains only two DNA-binding domains: CR3 and HD (39Vandenheuvel G.B. Quaggin S.E. Igarashi P. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Goulet B. Watson P. Poirier M. Leduy L. Berube G. Meterissian S. Jolicoeur P. Nepveu A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6625-6633PubMed Google Scholar). Predictably, CDP/Cux p110 and p75 exhibited DNA binding properties similar to those of CR2CR3HD and CR3HD (37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Goulet B. Watson P. Poirier M. Leduy L. Berube G. Meterissian S. Jolicoeur P. Nepveu A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6625-6633PubMed Google Scholar). The three major CDP/Cux isoforms, therefore, carry different DNA binding activities and, potentially, different transcriptional functions. Consistent with their ability to make a stable interaction with DNA, the p75 and p110 isoforms were shown to be able to participate in the transcriptional activation of specific promoters (31Truscott M. Raynal L. Premdas P. Goulet B. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3013-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). How CDP/Cux may function as a repressor on some promoters and as an activator on other promoters remains to be fully investigated. Interestingly, the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of CDP/Cux are regulated by a number of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation by protein kinase C, casein kinase II, and cyclin A/Cdk1, dephosphorylation by Cdc25A, acetylation by p300/CBP-associated factor, and proteolytic processing by cathepsin L (37Moon N.S.

We noticed that those cDNA clones that were incomplete at their 5′ end generated N-terminally truncated proteins that appeared to bind more efficiently to DNA than the full-length protein. We therefore decided to carry a systematic analysis of recombinant CDP/Cux proteins that were truncated at strategic positions. One question we sought to answer was why the full-length p200 protein was able to bind to DNA only transiently despite the presence of the Cut repeat 3 and the Cut homeodomain, which, on their own, are capable of making a very stable interaction with DNA. Our results indicated that the simultaneous presence of CR1 and CR2 within a protein somehow prevents stable DNA binding. In addition, our results revealed that a region at the extreme N terminus of CDP/Cux p200 is able, on its own, to inhibit DNA binding by the full-length protein or any combination of CDP/Cux DNA-binding domains. Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using ExGen500 reagent (MBI Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hs578T breast cancer epithelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% fetal bovine serum (50Hackett A.J. Smith H.S. Springer E.L. Owens R.B. Nelson-Rees W.A. Riggs J.L. Gardner M.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1977; 58: 1795-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and were transfected using GeneJuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CDP/Cux Isoforms—Plasmid sequences and maps will be provided upon request. The following recombinant CDP/Cux proteins include the indicated amino acids and were expressed as histidine-tagged protein using the pTriEx-2 vector (Novagen): (a) 1–1505; (b) 324-1505; (c) 547-1328; (d) 612-1328; (g) 1–1505Δ281–1001;(l) 182-1505Δ324–659; (m) 1–1505Δ181–659. Other proteins were expressed using the pXM139 mammalian expressing vector (51Lemay S. Davidson D. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2743-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar): (e) 1–1505Δ325–659; (f) 659-1505; (h),1029–1505; (i),1–1029. The pET-15b vector (Novagen) was used to express (j) 522-1027; 1–101/CR3HD-(1125–1308); 1–183/CR3HD; 1–281/CR3HD; 1–324/CR3HD; 94–324/CR3HD; 1–101/CR1CR2-(522–1027); 1–324/CR1CR2; 94–324/CR1CR2. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (Moon et al. (37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)). Expression and Purification of Protein Produced in Bacteria—Bacterially expressed His-tagged fusion isoforms were expressed and purified as described (Moon et al. (37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSA were performed as described (Moon et al. (37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) except that we used 60 ng of poly(dI-dC) and 3 μg of bovine serum albumin as nonspecific competitors. Depending of the level of the isoform expressed, 0.5–5 μg of nuclear extract was used to obtain the same quantity of specific protein in each assay. In the case of purified proteins, 40 ng of protein was used (see Fig. 3) unless otherwise indicated (see Fig. 5). Samples were loaded on 3.5% Tris-glycine or 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA (see Fig. 5) polyacrylamide gels.Fig. 5The autoinhibitory domain prevents stable DNA binding. A and B, increasing amounts (1, 10, 100, 500, 1000 ng) of bacterially purified CR3HD, 1–101+CR3HD, or 1–324+CR3HD proteins were analyzed in EMSA with the CGATATCGAT probe (A) or a DNA sequence derived from the immediate promoter (–40/–14) of the DNA pol α gene (B). C, 10 ng of purified protein was migrated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-1300 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Oligonucleotides—EMSA analysis was done with the oligonucleotides indicated in the figure legends. The sequences are as follows: CGATATCGAT (universal CDP/Cux consensus binding site), 5′-TCGAGACGATATCGATAAGCTTCTTTTC-3′; CCAAT-CGAT (binding site for CR1CR2), 5′-TCGAGAAAAGAACAACCAATCACCGATC-3′; ATCGAT (binding site for CR3HD and CR2CR3HD), 5′-TCGAGACGGTATCGATAAGCTTCTTTTC-3′; DNA pol α (–40/–14), 5′-GGGCCGCTGATTGGCTTTCAGGCTGGCGCCTCGA-3′. Western Blot Analysis—Visualization and control for protein normalization were done by Western blot analysis as described (Moon et al. (37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) using the antibodies specified in each figure. Luciferase Assay—Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because the internal control plasmid is itself often repressed by CDP/Cux, as a control for transfection efficiency, the purified β-galactosidase protein (Sigma) was included in the transfection mix, as described previously (52Howcroft T.K. Kirshner S.L. Singer D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was then normalized based on β-galactosidase activity. The Presence of Cut Repeat 1 (CR1) within CDP/Cux Determines Its DNA Binding Specificity—Previous studies have established that the DNA binding properties of CDP/Cux isoforms are greatly affected by the presence or absence of the Cut repeat 1 (28Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This is illustrated in Fig. 1 with recombinant proteins c and d. Plasmid vectors expressing various CDP/Cux recombinant proteins were introduced into NIH3T3 cells. Two days later, nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed in EMSAs. A diagram showing the maps of the recombinant proteins is shown in Fig. 1C. Western blot analysis confirmed that all recombinant proteins were expressed (Fig. 1B). Importantly, the amounts of nuclear extracts used in the Western and EMSA analyses were too small to permit the detection of endogenous CDP/Cux species in either assay (Fig. 1B, lane 1, and 1A, lanes 1 and 10). Two DNA probes were used in EMSA. One probe, which contained a direct repeat of the CRAT motif (r = A or G), was previously shown to represent an optimal binding site for the composite DNA-binding domains, CR1 and CR2 (CR1CR2) (28Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The second probe included the ATCGAT sequence, which is recognized by composite domains containing the Cut homeodomain and either one or two Cut repeats (CR3HD and CR2CR3HD). The protein d, which includes CR2, CR3, and the HD, but not CR1, was able to form a complex with the ATCGAT probe but not with the CAAT/CGAT probe (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 8 and 17). Note that the addition of the CDP/Cux 861 antibody was able to supershift the retarded complex formed with the ATCGAT probe (Fig. 1A, lane 18). In contrast, the protein c, which comprises CR1, CR2, CR3, and the HD, was able to bind to the CAAT/CGAT probe but not to the ATCGAT probe (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 6 and 15). Again, the addition of a specific antibody was able to supershift the retarded complex (Fig. 1A, lane 7). Thus, proteins c and d exhibited opposite DNA binding specificities. These results demonstrate that the DNA binding specificity of CDP/Cux isoforms is determined by the presence or absence of CR1. The Presence of the N-terminal Region within the Full-length CDP/Cux Protein Inhibits Its DNA Binding Activity—The protein b, which also included all four DNA-binding domains, exhibited a DNA binding specificity similar to that of protein c; it bound to the CAAT/CGAT probe but not to the ATCGAT probe (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 4 and 13). Interestingly, the protein a, which started at amino acid 1 and also included all four DNA binding domains, did not appreciably bind to either probe (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 3, 11, and 12). These results suggested that the N-terminal region of CDP/Cux somehow interferes with DNA binding. The N-terminal Region Inhibits DNA Binding by CR1CR2, CR3HD, and CR2CR3HD—To further investigate the effect of the N-terminal region, we generated shorter recombinant proteins that contained various combinations of DNA-binding domains fused or not to the N-terminal region of CDP/Cux: CR1CR2 (i and j), CR3HD (g and h), and CR2CR3HD (l and m) (diagram in Fig. 2C). Proteins were expressed in NIH3T3 cells and were tested in Western blot and EMSA analysis, as described in Fig. 1. Western blot analysis confirmed that the recombinant proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 2A). To be able to compare the results obtained with various proteins in EMSA, we used a probe that contains a direct repeat of the CGAT motif in addition to the ATCGAT sequence. This probe was previously shown to contain excellent binding sites for all combinations of Cut repeats and the Cut homeodomain (28Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In each case, the inclusion of various lengths of N-terminal sequences greatly reduced the ability of the proteins to bind to DNA (Fig. 2B, compare i and j, lanes 2 and 3; g and h, lanes 5 and 6; and l and m, lanes 7 and 9). These results demonstrate that the N-terminal region of CDP/Cux is able to inhibit DNA binding by various combinations of CDP/Cux DNA-binding domains. The N-terminal Region of CDP/Cux Inhibits DNA Binding without the Intervention of a Partner Protein—We considered two mechanisms to account for the inhibitory effect of the N-terminal region. This region may act as a binding site for a protein that inhibits CDP/Cux activity. Alternatively, the reduction in DNA binding may involve a direct effect of the N-terminal region. To distinguish between these two hypotheses and to map the inhibitory domain more precisely, we engineered vectors for the expression of proteins in bacteria and their purification by affinity chromatography on nickel beads. We prepared a panel of proteins that included the CR3HD or the CR1CR2 region fused to various segments of the N-terminal region (Fig. 3C). All proteins were obtained in comparable amounts (Fig. 3A, lanes 6–10, and 3B, lanes 5–8). Proteins that included the N-terminal region from amino acids 1 to 324, 1 to 281, 1 to 183, or 1 to 101 were impaired in their ability to form a complex with the DNA probe (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4, and 3B, lanes 1–3). In contrast, the protein 94–324 was able to bind to DNA efficiently (Fig. 3A, lane 5; Fig. 3B, lane 4). In conclusion, the region from amino acids 1 to 101 is able to inhibit DNA binding by CR1CR2 o"
https://openalex.org/W2109350002,"ATP hydrolysis and synthesis by the F0F1-ATP synthase are coupled to proton translocation across the membrane in the presence of magnesium. Calcium is known, however, to disrupt this coupling in the photosynthetic enzyme in a unique way: it does not support ATP synthesis, and CaATP hydrolysis is decoupled from any proton translocation, but the membrane does not become leaky to protons. Understanding the molecular basis of these calcium-dependent effects can shed light on the as yet unclear mechanism of coupling between proton transport and rotational catalysis. We show here, using an actin filament γ-rotation assay, that CaATP is capable of sustaining rotational motion in a highly active hybrid photosynthetic F1-ATPase consisting of α and β subunits from Rhodospirillum rubrum and γ subunit from spinach chloroplasts (αR3βR3γC). The rotation was found to be similar to that induced by MgATP in Escherichia coli F1-ATPase molecules. Our results suggest a possible long range pathway that enables the bound CaATP to induce full rotational motion of γ but might block transmission of this rotational motion into proton translocation by the F0 part of the ATP synthase.

Our results suggest a possible long range pathway that enables the bound CaATP to induce full rotational motion of γ but might block transmission of this rotational motion into proton translocation by the F0 part of the ATP synthase. Recent experiments have provided strong evidence for the rotational catalysis mechanism proposed for the ubiquitous enzyme F0F1-ATPase/ATP synthase (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 2Yoshida M. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Particularly striking is the effort led by several laboratories to measure the rotational motion of the F1 part of the enzyme on the single-molecule level. F1 is constructed of five subunits, with a stoichiometry of α3β3γδϵ. Fluorescent actin filaments attached to the γ subunit of engineered surface-immobilized α3β3γ subcomplexes of the enzyme, either from a thermophyilic bacterium, TF1 1The abbreviations used are: CF1, EF1, RF1 and TF1, F1 -ATPases from chloroplasts, E. coli, R. rubrum, and thermophilic Bacillus PS3, respectively; αR, βR-α, and β subunits from Rhodospirilum rubrum; γC, γ subunit from spinach chloroplast; HRP-Ni-NTA, horseradish peroxidase nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; N, newton.

Engelbrecht S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), were shown to rotate unidirectionally while hydrolyzing MgATP. This rotation was not only dependent on ATP concentration but was shown to have almost 100% efficiency of chemical to mechanical energy conversion. At very low ATP concentration the stepwise motion of the enzyme was exposed (6Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Small beads attached to γ in place of the actin filament allowed Yasuda et al. (7Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) to follow the motion at the limit of small load and watch rotation at a rate as high as 130 revolutions per second. Most spectacularly, forced clockwise rotation was shown very recently to lead to ATP synthesis, thus confirming the essential role of γ subunit rotation in both directions of the reaction (8Itoh H. Takahashi A. Adachi K. Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 2004; 427: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Some single-molecule work also addressed the operation of the F0 part of the F0F1-ATP synthase. It was shown that the F0-c subunit oligomer, which consists of 10–14 identical c subunits, is capable of rotating together with γ (9Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). While much new information has been collected regarding rotational catalysis in the ATP synthase, there are still many open questions, mainly in relation to the coupling between enzymatic activity and rotational motion. The photosynthetic version of the ATP synthase is an attractive system to probe some of these questions, since it presents several distinct functional properties. These include the tight regulation of ATP hydrolysis, which is especially important in photosynthetic cells, where it prevents the depletion of essential ATP pools in the dark (11Gromet-Elhanan Z. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 807-830Google Scholar, 12Richter M.L. Hein R.

Biol. 2000; 51: 83-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, plant chloroplasts have a unique regulatory system, termed thiol modulation, which leads to reduction of a disulfide bond formed between Cys-199 and Cys-205, located in the so-called switch region of the CF1-γ subunit that does not appear in any other type of CF1-γ (14Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The oxidation of the disulfide bond inhibits the ATPase activity of the enzyme, while its reduction stimulates it. Thiol modulation was studied indirectly on the single-molecule level by Bald et al. (15Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) who transferred the switch region from the CF1-γ subunit to a TF1-γ subunit. A second unique feature of ATP synthases of both chloroplasts (16Hochman Y. Lanir A. Carmeli C. FEBS Lett. 1976; 61: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and chromatophores (17Gromet-Elhanan Z. Weiss S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3645-3650Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is their high sensitivity to inhibition by excess free Mg2+ ions, which results in a drastic reduction of their MgATPase activities at a Mg/ATP ratio exceeding 0.5. Another very interesting phenomenon, found in both chloroplasts (18Pick U. Weiss M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and chromatophores (17Gromet-Elhanan Z. Weiss S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3645-3650Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), is the decoupling of Ca2+-induced ATP hydrolysis from proton translocation, although their membranes do not become leaky to protons. Both systems also show no Ca2+-dependent ATP synthesis. Understanding the mechanism by which calcium decouples ATP hydrolysis and proton translocation can enhance our knowledge of the interaction between various parts of the F0F1 molecule in relation to its functionality. We provide here the first step toward this goal by demonstrating that the assembled hybrid photosynthetic F1-αR3βR3γC complex, recently described in our laboratory (19Du Z. Tucker W.C. Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11517-11523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), shows rotational motion in the presence of CaATP. This result indicates that the decoupling effect of calcium, which does not interrupt the connection between ATP hydrolysis and γC rotation, might be mediated by a long range effect on the membrane bound F0 subunits. Materials—Biotinylated G-actin was obtained from Cytoskeleton. Biotin-PEAC5-maleimide was from Dojindo. The phalloidin-tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate conjugate was from Fluka, and the HRP-Ni-NTA conjugate was from Qiagen. ATP (grade II), glucose oxidase, catalase, and streptavidin were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest quality reagent grade available. Reconstitution and Biotinylation of the Hybrid F1 Enzyme—Recombinant αR containing an N-terminal His6 tag was obtained by amplification of the αR gene from pTZα (20Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and ligation into the pET14b expression vector. This His-tagged αR, as well as the recombinant βR (21Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10933-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and γC (22Sokolov M. Lu L. Tucker W. Gao F. Gegenheimer P.A. Richter M.L. J.

These inclusion bodies were individually solubilized and the expressed proteins were diluted with the refolding buffer (20Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), assembled into the hybrid αR3βR3γC complex, and purified by high performance liquid chromatography as described by Du et al. (19Du Z. Tucker W.C. Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11517-11523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The purity of the isolated hybrid complex was evaluated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Specific biotinylation of the αR3βR3γC complex was achieved by using the reversible disulfide bond formed between cysteine residues 199 and 205 of the γC subunit, as described by Hisabori et al. (23Hisabori T. Kondoh A. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Purified αR3βR3γC was oxidized with 200 μm CuCl2, for 1 h at 22 °C, to promote disulfide bond formation before the addition of 1 mmN-ethylmaleimide to block all other exposed cysteines. The γC disulfide of the N-ethylmaleimide-treated complex was then reduced by incubation with 20 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 22 °C. After passage through two successive Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns to remove the excess reductant, the enzyme was labeled with a 3-fold excess of biotin-PEAC5-maleimide for 30 min at 22 °C. The labeling was stopped by the addition of 200 μm cysteine followed by passage through a centrifuge column. The specificity of labeling was confirmed by Western blots (Fig. 1B). EF1-α3β3γ Complexes—These complexes were prepared according to Noji et al. (5Noji H. Hasler K. Junge W. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Engelbrecht S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and Panke et al. (10Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and kindly supplied by Drs. W. Junge and S. Engelbrecht. Polimerization of the Biotinylated G-actin—Stocks of biotinylated G-actin were maintained at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 2 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP at –80 °C. To obtain fluorescently labeled F-actin, the protein was diluted to 18 μm into the polymerization buffer at a final concentration of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 36 μm phalloidintetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate conjugate and polymerized overnight at 4 °C. Rotational Assays—Construction of the flow cells, adherence of the His6-tagged and biotinylated αR3βR3γC, and infusion of the actin filaments were carried out essentially as described previously for TF1- and EF1-α3β3γ complexes (3Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar, 4Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, flow cells with a chamber volume of 20–30 μl were infused with the following series of buffers (2 × 25 μl per step, 5-min incubation): 1) Buffer A (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) with 2.4 μm HRP-Ni-NTA; 2) Buffer B (Buffer A plus 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with a 3 nm concentration of the biotinylated αR3βR3γC complex; 3) Buffer B with 50 nm streptavidin; and 4) Buffer B with 50 nm fluorescently labeled actin filaments. Each step was followed with a wash of 100 μl of Buffer B, except for step 4, after which we performed a wash with 100 μl of Buffer B and 100 μl of Buffer A, both lacking MgCl2. CaATP-dependent rotation was initiated by the infusion of 50 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 4 mm CaCl2, 4 mm ATP, 216 μg/ml glucose oxidase, 36 μg/ml catalase, 25 mm glucose, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The EF1-α3β3γ ATPase was adsorbed into the flow cell in a similar fashion, but since its MgATP-dependent rotation was tested, the CaCl2 in the reaction mixture was replaced with 2 mm MgCl2. Immediately following infusion of the reaction buffer, the flow cell was mounted on an inverted microscope (Olympus) and illuminated with a mercury lamp. Fluorescent images were taken using a digital intensified CCD camera (Roper Scientific). Typically, 500 frames were collected from each microscope field of view at a rate of 15 frames per second. Images were processed using custom-written Matlab routines. Other Methods—Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis activities were measured for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 4 mm ATP, 4 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 μg of enzyme. For measuring MgATPase activity the 4 mm CaCl2 was replaced by 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 μg of enzyme was used. Pi release was determined as described by Taussky and Shorr (24Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or according to Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217390) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out on Novex Pre-Cast 10–20% Tris-glycine gradient gels. We have recently assembled in our laboratory a hybrid photosynthetic F1-ATPase consisting of RF1-αR and βR subunits andaCF1-γ C subunit, all expressed in E. coli (19Du Z. Tucker W.C. Richter M.L.

The isolated hybrid αR3βR3γC complex showed high ATPase activity, particularly in the presence of CaATP as a substrate, reaching 167 s–1 even when assayed at 22 °C in its biotinylated state (Table I). The complex fully retained the unique properties of its parent ATPases, which include sensitivity to inhibition by free magnesium (16Hochman Y. Lanir A. Carmeli C.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3645-3650Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and a higher CaATPase than MgATPase activity (Table I), both being modulated by γC oxidation and reduction (19Du Z. Tucker W.C.

Single-molecule studies of extracted native CF1 (lacking a δ subunit) have already provided some evidence for its γ subunit rotation (23Hisabori T. Kondoh A. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). But this native CF1 (-δ) showed a very low MgATPase activity of 1.3 s–1 at 25 °C and could be fixed to the glass surface only spontaneously. The availability of our highly active recombinant αR3βR3γC enabled us to apply protein engineering tools and other experimental methods similar to those employed with the bacterial TF1 (3Noji H.

The much higher activity of the enzyme in the presence of CaATP, as compared with MgATP (Table I), suggests that it must be caused by multiple site catalysis (28Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and should therefore involve γC subunit rotation within our hybrid complex. We therefore started monitoring rotational motion of individual αR3βR3γC hybrid F1-ATPase molecules in the presence of calcium, using the relatively simple and broadly applicable actin filament assay. A limitation of this assay is the load exerted by the large actin filament on the rotating enzyme, but this limitation is also an asset, as it allows determining the torque developed by the protein through the relation between filament length and rotation speed (6Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). To facilitate the attachment of our hybrid complex to the glass surface, via absorption to an HRP-Ni-NTA conjugate, a His6-tag was introduced at the N terminus of the αR subunit, as described by Omote et al. (4Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7780-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Attachment of the fluorescently labeled actin filament at the opposite end of the molecule was achieved by forming a biotin-streptavidin-biotin linkage between the filament and the specific cysteine pair in γC. Using a streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase we demonstrated that the biotinylation appears specifically in the γC subunit and is dependent on the prereduction of its disulfide (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). The binding of biotin had no significant effect on either Mg2+-dependent or Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. However, at 22 °C, the temperature of the rotation assays, MgATPase activity was reduced much more than CaATPase activity (Table I). Molecules of our αR3βR3γC complex readily adsorbed to a glass surface covered with HRP-Ni-NTA, but no enzyme attachment occurred in the absence of the HRP-Ni-NTA conjugate. The fluorescent actin filaments attached to the immobilized proteins only after addition of streptavidin and were easily washed out if the biotinylated αR3βR3γC complex was not present in the flow cell (data not shown). About 100 fluorescent actin filaments could be observed in each field of view of the microscope, and on the average one molecule in a field showed rotational motion in presence of the CaATP buffer, a percentage that is comparable with previous reports (6Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 9Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). An example of a rotating filament is shown in Fig. 2A, and the rotational trajectories of several molecules are plotted in Fig. 2B. Since a CaATPase induced rotation has never been studied before, we performed identical studies using the EF1-α3β3γ MgATPase, whose rotational motion was already thoroughly investigated (4Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7780-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Noji H. Hasler K.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A comparison of the EF1-MgATPase and αR3βR3γC-CaATPase-induced rotation is presented in Fig. 3, in which the rotational velocity (in inverse seconds) is plotted as a function of filament length for the two groups. Only molecules that showed at least 5 full rotations (>70% of the rotating molecules) were included in this figure. The solid lines (see legend to Fig. 3) were calculated based on the following relation between the rotation velocity in Hz, ν, and the applied torque N: ν = 1/3τcat + 2π ζ/N, in which τcat is the turnover time of the enzyme, and ζ is the rotational friction coefficient that depends on the filament length L. For a rigid filament ζ is given by 4π ηL3/3[ln(L/2r)–0.447], in which η is the viscosity of the solution and r is the filament radius, taken as 5 nm (6Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 30Hunt A.J. Gittes F. Howard J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 766-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The torque developed by each molecule was calculated by inverting the above equation. The average torque was 14.6 ± 1.5 pN·nm for the hybrid αR3βR3γC and 16.8 ± 1.4 pN·nm for the EF1-α3β3γ molecules. While these values are smaller than previously reported (4Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7780-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Noji H. Hasler K. Junge W. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Engelbrecht S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), the high similarity between the two groups of molecules is quite striking and suggests that they rotate in a very similar fashion. We also found that the αR3βR3γC complexes could rotate in the presence of MgATP, very similarly to the CaATP-induced rotation, but only when 100 mm of bicarbonate were added (data not shown). This finding is on par with earlier reports that the MgATPase activity of both CF1 (16Hochman Y. Lanir A. Carmeli C. FEBS Lett. 1976; 61: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and RF1 (17Gromet-Elhanan Z. Weiss S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3645-3650Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is very sensitive to inhibition by free Mg2, and in both cases high rates of catalysis require addition of oxyanions such as bicarbonate or sulfite (19Du Z. Tucker W.C. Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11517-11523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Nelson N. Nelson H. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6506-6510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, at 22 °C under the conditions of the rotation assay, the MgATPase activity of the αR3βR3γC complex was 4-fold lower than its CaATPase activity (Table I). This difference could account for the lack of any MgATP-induced γC rotation in the absence of bicarbonate. Indeed, a strong, nonlinear relation between ATPase activity and the number of rotating molecules was already noted by Müller et al. (32Müller M. Pänke O. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23308-23313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). How can CaATP-induced rotational motion of the photosynthetic αR3βR3γC complex be explained, in view of the decoupling activity of calcium? Current models of the function of F0F1-ATP synthase assert that the protonmotive force created by proton translocation through the F0 part drives rotation of the c subunit oligomer, which in turn causes rotation of the γ subunit, leading to ATP synthesis by the F1 part (33Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 34Oster G. Wang H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 482-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A reverse sequence of events is expected to occur following ATP hydrolysis, which should drive rotation of the γ subunit, leading to rotation of the c subunit oligomer that is coupled to proton translocation. Indeed, it has been shown that γ rotation is contemporaneous with rotation of the c subunit oligomer in both TF1 and EF1 (9Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 35Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Boyer's binding change mechanism recognizes three asymmetric catalytic sites on the three β subunits (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). These three sites interconvert as the γ subunit rotates. Efficient ATP synthesis without waste of energy requires coupling between events occurring at the three sites and proton translocation. Thus proton translocation must occur only after ADP and Pi bind at a loose catalytic site, while at the same time an ATP molecule is bound at the tight site (36Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This scheme was borne out by experiments carried out by Cross and co-workers (37Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) who showed that a protonmotive force cannot sustain rotation in the absence of ADP and Pi in the medium. Consequently, there has to be a switch mechanism that couples or decouples the F1 and F0 parts and transmits information between them in both directions (38Penefsky H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1589-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 39Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1539-1545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It could involve some form of a conformational change induced by substrate binding at the β catalytic sites and further transmitted through the γ subunit to the F0-c subunits. The combined effects of calcium, which include both a modulation of F1 activity and decoupling of F1 and F0, point to its involvement with the same switch mechanism suggested by Cross (36Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Since the current study shows that the αR3βR3γC decoupled CaATPase activity does not hinder γC rotation, it is likely that the switch works in parallel to, but outside, the rotational pathway. It might involve, for example, the F1-ϵ subunit, which is a well known inhibitor of both CaATPase and MgATPase activity in the photosynthetic F1 (27Tucker W.C. Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Richter M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2179-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 40Nowak K.F. McCarty R.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3273-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We cannot currently rule out a direct effect of calcium at a more “downstream” position than suggested here, e.g. at the F0-c subunit. However, we believe that our results, combined with previous indications in the literature (36Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), do suggest that the calcium effect is related to a long range pathway for allosteric communication between the F0 and F1 parts of the ATP synthase. The experimental system described in this work provides an opportunity to directly check this hypothesis. In particular, the difference between CaATP and MgATP binding at the active sites on the interface between the α and β subunits should be probed. This can now be studied in our photosynthetic complex, since we have already assembled a hybrid αR3βR3γC containing the catalytic site mutant βR-T159S (41Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 901-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which shows exceptionally high MgATPase but very low CaAT-Pase activities (19Du Z. Tucker W.C. Richter M.L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11517-11523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Carmeli and co-workers (42Hochman Y. Gong X.M. Lifshitz Y. Carmeli C. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 37: 459-469PubMed Google Scholar) suggested recently, based on a simulation, that the average bond length of a Ca2+ ion at the active site of F1 is longer by 0.3 Å than that of Mg2+. It is as yet unknown how such local differences in binding can propagate through the structure of the β subunit into the CF1 γ and the F0 c and a subunits. It will therefore be important to attempt to assemble the c subunit oligomer into the hybrid protein and test rotation of this part of the enzyme in the presence of calcium. These and other future studies will be facilitated by the current availability of a fully active recombinant photosynthetic protein that shows rotational motion. We thank Drs. Sigfried Engelbrecht and Wolfgang Junge for kindly supplying us with E. Coli F1-ATPase and for carefully reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2089157935,"The DNA polymerase encoded by bacteriophage T5 has been reported previously to be processive and to catalyze extensive strand displacement synthesis. The enzyme, purified from phage-infected cells, did not require accessory proteins for these activities. Although T5 DNA polymerase shares extensive sequence homology with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and T7 DNA polymerase, it contains unique regions of 130 and 71 residues at its N and C termini, respectively. We cloned the gene encoding wild-type T5 DNA polymerase and characterized the overproduced protein. We also examined the effect of N- and C-terminal deletions on processivity and strand displacement synthesis. T5 DNA polymerase lacking its N-terminal 30 residues resembled the wild-type enzyme albeit with a 2-fold reduction in polymerase activity. Deletion of 24 residues at the C terminus resulted in a 30-fold reduction in polymerase activity on primed circular DNA, had dramatically reduced processivity, and was unable to carry out strand displacement synthesis. Deletion of 63 residues at the C terminus resulted in a 20,000-fold reduction in polymerase activity. The 3′ to 5′ double-stranded DNA exonuclease activity associated with T5 DNA polymerase was reduced by a factor of 5 in the polymerase truncated at the N terminus but was stimulated by a factor of 7 in the polymerase truncated at the C terminus. We propose a model in which the C terminus increases the affinity of the DNA for the polymerase active site, thus increasing processivity and decreasing the accessibility of the DNA to the exonuclease active site.

We propose a model in which the C terminus increases the affinity of the DNA for the polymerase active site, thus increasing processivity and decreasing the accessibility of the DNA to the exonuclease active site. Upon infection of Escherichia coli by bacteriophage T5, a new DNA polymerase activity is induced (1Orr C.W.M. Herriott S.T. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4652-4658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activity is essential for phage DNA replication and phage growth (2De Waard A. Paul A.V. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Das S.K. Fujimura R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7149-7154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme, like many prokaryotic DNA polymerases, has an associated 3′–5′-exonuclease activity that is active on single- and double-stranded DNA (4Das S.K. Fujimura R.K. J. Virol. 1976; 20: 70-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fujimura R.K. Roop B.C. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4403-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Early studies with the purified enzyme showed that it had two properties not found in most DNA polymerases: a processivity of polymerization of nucleotides on single-stranded DNA that was greater than that observed with other DNA polymerases tested (6Das S.K. Fujimura R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1227-1232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the ability to catalyze extensive strand displacement synthesis on duplex DNA (7Fujimura R.K. Roop B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2168-2174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One goal of the present study was to characterize these two interesting properties of T5 DNA polymerase purified from cells expressing the cloned T5 DNA polymerase gene and thus free of any contaminating phage-encoded proteins. The gene for T5 DNA polymerase has been sequenced (8Leavitt M.C. Ito J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4465-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based on alignment of homologous regions, it is a member of the pol 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein. I family of DNA polymerases (8Leavitt M.C. Ito J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4465-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The alignment between the large fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, T5 DNA polymerase, and T7 DNA polymerase, another phage replicative DNA polymerase, is shown in Fig. 1. T5 DNA polymerase has an extension on each end that is not found in other polymerases from the pol I family. There are an additional 159 residues at the N terminus not present in T7 DNA polymerase (Fig. 1), 130 of which are not present in the N terminus of the large fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. At the C terminus, there are 71 residues not found in T7 DNA polymerase or E. coli DNA polymerase I. The role of E. coli DNA polymerase I is primarily in the repair of DNA; as such it has low processivity and does not interact strongly with other proteins. T5 and T7 DNA polymerases, being replicative DNA polymerases, must interact with other proteins. Most replicative DNA polymerases, such as E. coli DNA polymerase III and T7 DNA polymerase, interact with a processivity factor in order to increase their binding to the primer-template, which in turn allows them to incorporate thousands of nucleotides in a single binding event (10Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the processivity factor is the β clamp, which assembles as a dimer to encircle duplex DNA, and then binds to the DNA polymerase multisubunit complex. T7 DNA polymerase, on the other hand, acquires the host E. coli thioredoxin as its processivity factor (11Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thioredoxin binds with high affinity to a unique 70-residue domain within the T7 DNA polymerase (Fig. 1); other members of the pol I family do not contain this insert (12Bedford E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ability of T5 DNA polymerase to catalyze extensive strand displacement synthesis in the absence of an accessory protein is also intriguing (7Fujimura R.K. Roop B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2168-2174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other members of the pol I family of DNA polymerases catalyze strand displacement synthesis but only after modification of the enzyme or the primer-template, or in the presence of accessory proteins. For example, E. coli DNA polymerase I will not initiate strand displacement synthesis unless the 5′ end of the non-template strand is already displaced, and the T7 DNA polymerase-thioredoxin complex will not catalyze such synthesis unless its exonuclease activity is reduced drastically (13Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phage T4 DNA polymerase likewise does not catalyze strand displacement synthesis (14Masamune Y. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2692-2701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, replicative DNA polymerases such as T7 and T4 DNA polymerases are dependent on their cognate DNA helicases to unwind the duplex DNA to expose single-stranded template ahead of the advancing replication fork. Under conditions where the T7 DNA polymerase-thioredoxin complex and E. coli DNA polymerase I catalyze strand displacement synthesis in the absence of a helicase, the polymerase frequently displays a phenomenon known as strand-switching, in which it transfers to the displaced strand without interrupting synthesis. The products of such synthesis are abnormal in that they are branched and contain hairpin structures (15Schildkraut C.L. Kornberg A. Richardson C.C. J. Mol.

Although the gene for T5 DNA polymerase has been cloned (17Chatterjee D.K. Fujimura R.K. Campbell J.H. Gerard G.F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 97: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the overproduced enzyme was reported to be insoluble, and thus its purification has not been described. In this paper, we report that the actual start site of the gene is 90 bp upstream of that reported previously, resulting in an enzyme of 97,600 daltons. We describe the purification and characterization of the overproduced wild-type T5 DNA polymerase. We also investigate the role of the unique regions at the ends of T5 DNA polymerase in the polymerase and exonuclease activities of the enzyme, and its ability to carry out processive DNA synthesis and extensive strand displacement synthesis. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Bacteriophage—E. coli HMS174-(DE3) and BL21(DE3)/pLysS and the plasmids pET19b and pET21d were from Novagen. E. coli C43(DE3) is a derivative of E. coli BL21(DE3) that has been selected for increased expression of some toxic genes (18Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). The plasmid pRSET-C was from Invitrogen. Phage T5 was from the laboratory collection. Growth and manipulation of phage T5 and E. coli were as described (1Orr C.W.M. Herriott S.T. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4652-4658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins—T5 DNA polymerase produced by phage T5-infected E. coli B cells was purified as described previously (1Orr C.W.M. Herriott S.T. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4652-4658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of T7 DNA polymerase (11Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6447-6458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB protein) (11Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been described. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. DNA, Oligonucleotides, and Nucleotides—M13mGP1-2 is a 9950-bp derivative of M13mp8 that has been described previously (11Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Salmon sperm DNA (type II) was from Sigma. The 17-nucleotide M13 primer (“-40”) was from New England Biolabs. Other oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies. Radioactive nucleotides were from Amersham Biosciences. Protein Sequencing—To determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence of T5 DNA polymerase, purified proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After the gel was stained, the bands containing protein were cut out of the membrane and subjected to Edman degradation (20Edman P. Acta Chem. Scand. 1950; 4: 283-293Crossref Google Scholar, 21Dopheide T.A. Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1833-1837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by the Biopolymers Facility at Harvard Medical School. Plasmids containing the desired sequences were constructed using standard PCR and cloning techniques (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 8.37-8.41Google Scholar). We initially cloned the gene for T5 DNA polymerase into the vector pRSET-C based on the sequence of the T5 DNA polymerase gene, reported previously (17Chatterjee D.K. Fujimura R.K. Campbell J.H. Gerard G.F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 97: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), to generate the plasmid pRSET-T5. However, our terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the T5 DNA polymerase purified from phage T5-infected cells showed that the start of the gene was 90 bp upstream from that published previously. The correct start site is shown in Fig. 2A. Thus this original clone produced a protein with a deletion of 30 residues at the N terminus, which we will refer to here as T5 NΔ30 DNA polymerase. We subsequently cloned the full-length gene using a combination of synthetic oligonucleotides and PCR products. We amplified a PCR fragment that contained the entire gene except for the first six codons; these codons were generated using a synthetic duplex fragment that was used to ligate the PCR fragment to the 5′ end of the expression vector pRSET-C (Fig. 2). The oligonucleotide used for PCR at the 3′ end of the gene contained a BamHI restriction site at its 5′ end. The oligonucleotide used for PCR at the 5′ end of the gene was complementary to the region around codons six and seven of the polymerase gene; it introduced silent mutations in codons six (CAT to CAG) and seven (CTA to CTG) to create a SalI restriction site (CAGCTG) at this position. The resulting PCR product (2600 bp) was digested with BamHI and SalI and was then gel-purified. This fragment was then ligated to the vector pRSET-C that had been digested with NdeI and BamHI, along with a duplex synthetic linker encoding the first six codons of the T5 DNA polymerase gene that contained ends complementary to SalI and NdeI restriction sites. The full-length cloned T5 DNA polymerase gene from this plasmid was then transferred into the vector pET19b by digesting both the pRSET-C plasmid containing the T5 DNA polymerase gene and pET19b with XbaI and BamHI, and then ligating the appropriate fragments. The resulting construct we refer to as pET19b-T5. Clones expressing the gene for T5 DNA polymerase with C-terminal deletions of 24 (CΔ24) and 63 (CΔ63) residues were constructed by standard PCR techniques using the appropriate primers and pET19b-T5 as a template. The resulting fragments were inserted into the vector pET21d, which resulted in the fusion of an eight-residue histidine tag to the C terminus of the induced protein. As a control, the wild-type T5 DNA polymerase gene was also inserted into this vector, such that the histidine tag was attached to the C terminus of the full-length T5 DNA polymerase. The DNA sequences of the T5 DNA polymerase gene in all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The scheme used for the purification of the wild-type T5 DNA polymerase was modified from that described by Steuart et al. (23Steuart C.D. Anand S.R. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5308-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification is summarized in Table I. During purification, the protein was monitored by polymerase assays using salmon sperm single-stranded DNA and by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Table IPurification of wild-type T5 DNA polymerase from 11 liters of E. coli C43(DE3) cells containing the plasmid pET19b-T5 DNA polymerase activity was assayed using salmon sperm single-stranded DNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One unit of DNA polymerase activity is defined as the amount required to incorporate 10 nmol of all four dNMPs into DNA in 30 min at 37 °C under standard assay conditions.FractionStepProteinTotal units (×106)Specific ActivityYieldmgunits/mg%IExtract10,0007.2720100IIPolyethyleneimine6,8008.31,220115IIIAmmonium sulfate4,5008.51,900118IVPhosphocellulose4504.810,70066VHQ2102.914,00040 Open table in a new tab Growth of Cells—The plasmid containing the gene for wild-type T5 DNA polymerase, pET19b-T5, was toxic in E. coli cells that allowed elevated levels of uninduced expression. For this reason we used the cells C43(DE3), a strain that was selected to give increased stability and expression to genes that are toxic (18Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). 11 liters of E. coli C43(DE3) cells containing the plasmid pET19b-T5 were grown with aeration at 37 °C in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in a fermenter. When the A590 of the cultures reached 1.2, the cells were induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the temperature was reduced to 25 °C. Six hours after induction, the A590 of the culture had reached 2.8, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Preparation of Cell Extract—Frozen cells (200 ml) were thawed at 0 °C, and lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. After incubating for 30 min at 4 °C, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m. The cells were then sonicated, and the lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 50,000 × g. The supernatant (180 ml) was fraction I (Table I). Precipitation of Nucleic Acids by Polyethyleneimine—To 180 ml of fraction I, 10% (w/v) polyethyleneimine (pH 7.5) was added to a final concentration of 0.1% with stirring for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted after centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (150 ml) was fraction II. Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation—To 150 ml of fraction II, 54 g of ammonium sulfate (60% saturation) was added over a 25-min period at 4 °C and was stirred gently for an additional 15 min. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was redissolved in 420 ml of 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol (Buffer A). The resuspended pellet (450 ml) was fraction III. Phosphocellulose Chromatography—200 ml of phosphocellulose P-11 (Whatman) was prepared according to the manufacturer and equilibrated with Buffer A. Fraction III was diluted to 800 ml with Buffer A to bring the conductivity to that equivalent to Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl, and was then mixed with the phosphocellulose in batch for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin was collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in 600 ml of Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl. After a second centrifugation, the resin was again washed with 300 ml of Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl. After the second wash, the resin was loaded onto a column (20 cm2 × 20 cm) by gravity. The column was washed with 2 liters of Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl. Proteins were eluted using a 2-liter linear gradient from 100 to 500 mm KCl in Buffer A. T5 DNA polymerase eluted at 300 mm KCl. Fraction IV (250 ml) was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 liters of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol (Buffer B) containing 50 mm NaCl. Anion Exchange Chromatography—Fraction IV was further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a 6-ml POROS HQ column on a BioCAD Sprint perfusion chromatography system (Applied Biosystems). Dialyzed fraction IV was applied to the column at 10 ml/min. The column was washed with 60 ml of Buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient from 100 to 400 mm NaCl in Buffer B. The proteins were monitored by A280, and fractions containing the single protein peak were pooled (fraction V, 90 ml). Fraction V was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 50% glycerol and then stored at -20 °C. The purification scheme was similar to that described for the wild-type T5 DNA polymerase above. During purification, the protein was monitored by polymerase assays using salmon sperm single-stranded DNA and by SDS-PAGE. Growth of Cells—11 liters of E. coli HMS174(DE3) cells containing the plasmid pRSET-T5 were grown with aeration at 36 °C in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in a fermenter. When the A590 of the cultures reached 1.3, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the temperature was reduced to 31 °C. Six hours after induction, the A590 of the culture had reached 2.5; the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at -80 °C. Preparation of Cell Extract—The cell pellet from the 11 liters of culture was suspended in 250 ml of Buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl and the protease inhibitors 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma). The cells were lysed by sonication and then centrifuged for 1 h at 50,000 × g. The supernatant (250 ml) was fraction I. Anion Exchange Chromatography (DEAE)—Fraction I was diluted 3-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% mercaptoethanol (Buffer C) to produce a final NaCl concentration of 100 mm. The diluted fraction I was loaded onto a column (20 cm2 x 16 cm) containing the anion exchange resin DEAE-DE52 (Whatman) that had been equilibrated with Buffer C. The column was washed with 200 ml of Buffer C containing 100 mm NaCl, and then the bound proteins were eluted with a 900-ml gradient from 300 mm to 1 m NaCl in Buffer C. Fractions containing T5 DNA polymerase were pooled (fraction II; 150 ml). Phosphocellulose Chromatography—A column (20 cm2 × 18 cm) of phosphocellulose P-11 was prepared according to the manufacturer (Whatman) and equilibrated with Buffer A. Fraction II was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against Buffer A containing 50 mm KCl and was then applied to the column. The column was washed with 300 ml of Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl. Proteins were eluted using a 750-ml linear gradient from 100 to 800 mm KCl in Buffer A. Fractions containing T5 DNA polymerase, which eluted at 600 mm KCl, were pooled (fraction III; 200 ml). Anion Exchange Chromatography (MonoQ)—The high resolution anion exchange resin Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the final purification step. MonoQ HR 10/10 (8 ml) was equilibrated with Buffer B. Fraction III was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against Buffer B containing 50 mm NaCl. Dialyzed fraction III was applied to the column, and then the column was washed with 25 ml of Buffer B containing 50 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted using a 120-ml linear gradient from 50 mm to 1 m NaCl in Buffer B. The proteins were monitored by A280, and fractions containing the single protein peak, which eluted at 600 mm NaCl, were pooled (fraction IVA, 20 ml). Fraction IVA was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 50% glycerol. After dialysis, the sample (fraction IVB, 7 ml) was stored at -20 °C. Genetically altered T5 DNA polymerases with truncations of either 24 or 63 residues at their C termini were overproduced in the vector pET21d that resulted in the fusion of an 8-histidine tag onto their C termini. After overproduction of each protein in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS, each was purified by using a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's procedures. For each protein, 1 liter of culture was grown in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking. At an A590 = 1.0, the cells were induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Three hours after induction, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min and then resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm KPO4, pH 8.0,and 500 mm NaCl (Buffer D) containing 10 mm imidazole at 4 °C. The resuspended cells were sonicated, and the extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The clear lysates were loaded onto a 5-ml column containing Ni-NTA-agarose at 4 °C. The column was washed with 50 ml of Buffer D containing 20 mm imidazole, and the proteins were eluted with 4 ml of Buffer D containing 500 mm imidazole. Fractions containing protein were identified by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar); they were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 50% glycerol. After dialysis, the proteins were stored at -20 °C. Activity on Salmon Sperm Single-stranded DNA—DNA polymerase activity was assayed by measuring the amount of 3H-nucleotide incorporated into alkali-denatured salmon sperm single-stranded DNA (23Steuart C.D. Anand S.R. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5308-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm dCTP, dATP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP (2.9 cpm/pmol), 0.3 mm salmon sperm single-stranded DNA (expressed as nucleotide equivalents), and variable amounts of enzyme diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (SED). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and then 45 μl were spotted on DE81 filter disks (Whatman). The filters were washed to remove unincorporated radioactivity as described (25Bryant F.R. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3537-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Activity on Primed M13 DNA—DNA polymerase activity on a 9,950-nucleotide, single-stranded M13 DNA with a 25-nucleotide primer annealed to it was determined by measuring the amount of 3H-nucleotide incorporated essentially as described (11Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (45 μl) contained 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.15 mm dCTP, dATP, dGTP, and [3H]dTTP (2.9 cpm/pmol) and 80 μm of the primed M13mGP1-2 DNA (expressed as nucleotide equivalents). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of the DNA polymerase diluted in SED. Reactions were carried out by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min and then terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. 55 μl were spotted on DE81 filter disks. The filters were washed to remove unincorporated radioactivity as described (25Bryant F.R. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3537-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Processivity Assay—The processivity of DNA synthesis was measured on a 9,950-nucleotide, single-stranded circular M13 DNA template containing a 5′-33P-labeled 17-mer primer, as described previously (11Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (17 μl) contained 15 pmol of 33P-labeled primer-template molecules (110,000 cpm), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 250 μm of all four dNTPs. The reaction mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 2 min, and then 3 μl of varying amounts of DNA polymerase diluted in SED were added. The reactions were allowed to proceed for varying times, as indicated. The samples were then analyzed by either native agarose gel electrophoresis or denaturing PAGE. For native agarose gel electrophoresis, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 30% glycerol, 100 mm EDTA, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol FF. The DNA products were separated by electrophoresis in a 0.6% agarose gel for 10 h at 40 V in 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA and a 1–10,000 dilution of GelStar (Cambrex, Inc.). After electrophoresis, gels were dried under vacuum. For denaturing PAGE, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 90% formamide, 25 mm EDTA, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol. The samples were heated for 2 min at 95 °C and then loaded on a 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 2 mm EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid, 15% methanol, transferred to Whatman No. 1 paper, and dried under vacuum. After drying, gels were analyzed by autoradiography to determine the location and amount of the radioactively labeled products. Strand Displacement Assay—The assay for strand displacement synthesis measured the length of radioactive products synthesized on primed M13 DNA. The 5′-33P-labeled primer annealed to the M13 DNA template was extended by DNA polymerase under the same conditions described in the processivity assay. Upon complete synthesis of the complementary strand of the M13 single-stran"
https://openalex.org/W2071671690,"Induced transformation of mouse fibroblasts was carried out by releasing tetracycline-repressed expression of an oncogenic mutant of STAT3, STAT3-C, or of v-Src or Ha-Ras. At 15 days after derepression of each oncogene, DNA microarrays showed elevation (>3-fold) of a similar group of ∼25 mRNAs compared to untransformed cells. RT–PCR confirmed a number of these mRNA elevations. RNA samples were then analysed at intervals during the first 24 h after doxycycline removal to determine the time of early changes. Extensive changes were not observed by array analysis, except in v-Src-expressing cells where about 10 mRNAs were elevated threefold or more. However, RT–PCR did uncover changes in each derepressed cell type that included some of the changes observed after the 15-day transformation period. In addition, STAT3-C target genes such as BclXI and cyclin D1, which were not observed on array analysis, were elevated by RT–PCR analysis. We conclude, therefore, that early after oncogene induction, transcriptional changes, including those initiated by STAT3-C, may occur only in scarce mRNA and/or to a limited extent. However, with additional time and probably additional cell division, a new epigenetic state is established that is mirrored by a changed transcriptional profile emblematic of transformation by each of three oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2036550181,"Tie2, an endothelial-cell-specific receptor tyrosine kinase, collaborates with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in regulating angiogenesis and vascular maturation. Here, we report a mutation of glycine to aspartic acid at the second glycine of the GXGXXG motif of Tie2 (G833DTie2) in human intramuscular haemangiomas (IMHs) of the capillary type. Murine endothelial cells (ECs) overexpressing this G833DTie2 receptor exhibited an increase in cell proliferation at low serum concentrations and angiosarcomas developed in nude mice, whereas cells overexpressing either wild-type Tie2 or Q837HTie2 failed to elicit these responses. Furthermore, the G833DTie2 receptor increased VEGF expression in ECs. These findings provide molecular mechanisms for pathogenesis of IMH."
https://openalex.org/W1973910682,"The molecular mechanisms regulating the cell fate decision between self-renewal and differentiation/apoptosis in stem and progenitor cells are poorly understood. Here, we report the first comprehensive identification of genes potentially involved in the switch from self-renewal toward differentiation of primary, non-immortalized erythroid avian progenitor cells (T2EC cells). We used the Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) technique in order to identify and quantify the genome fraction functionally active in a self-renewing versus a differentiating cell population. We generated two SAGE libraries and sequenced a total of 37 589 tags, thereby obtaining the first transcriptional profile characterization of a chicken cell. Tag identification was performed using a new relational database (Identitag) developed in the laboratory, which allowed a highly satisfactory level of identification. Among 123 differentially expressed genes, 11 were investigated further and for nine of them the differential expression was subsequently confirmed by real-time PCR. The comparison of tag abundance between the two libraries revealed that only a small fraction of transcripts was differentially expressed. The analysis of their functions argue against a prominent role for a master switch in T2EC cells decision-making, but are in favor of a critical role for coordinated small variations in a relatively small number of genes that can lead to essential cellular identity changes."
https://openalex.org/W2140688104,"Fragile X syndrome is associated with a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene and hypermethylation of the FMR1 promoter. Rare cases of clinically normal males (HFM) have been identified with an expanded CGG repeat; however, here, the FMR1 promoter is not methylated. Using classical complementation (cell fusion) studies, we analyzed if possible differences in the genetic background between HFM and cells from individuals with fragile X syndrome (FX cells) could have an influence on the methylation status of the FMR1 promoter. We observed that demethylation of the hypermethylated FMR1 promoter can occur when FX cells are complemented (by cell fusion) with cells from HFM as well as with cells from control individuals. The observed demethylation is specific and can happen without DNA replication. In contrast, demethylation was not observed when cells from unrelated individuals with fragile X syndrome were fused, indicating that FX cells have lost the necessary factor(s) to demethylate the aberrantly methylated FMR1 promoter."
