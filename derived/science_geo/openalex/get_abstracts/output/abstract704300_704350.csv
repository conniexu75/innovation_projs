https://openalex.org/W4309334544,"Abstract The tumour-associated microbiota is an intrinsic component of the tumour microenvironment across human cancer types 1,2 . Intratumoral host–microbiota studies have so far largely relied on bulk tissue analysis 1–3 , which obscures the spatial distribution and localized effect of the microbiota within tumours. Here, by applying in situ spatial-profiling technologies 4 and single-cell RNA sequencing 5 to oral squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer, we reveal spatial, cellular and molecular host–microbe interactions. We adapted 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics to determine the identity and in situ location of intratumoral microbial communities within patient tissues. Using GeoMx digital spatial profiling 6 , we show that bacterial communities populate microniches that are less vascularized, highly immuno‑suppressive and associated with malignant cells with lower levels of Ki-67 as compared to bacteria-negative tumour regions. We developed a single-cell RNA-sequencing method that we name INVADEseq (invasion–adhesion-directed expression sequencing) and, by applying this to patient tumours, identify cell-associated bacteria and the host cells with which they interact, as well as uncovering alterations in transcriptional pathways that are involved in inflammation, metastasis, cell dormancy and DNA repair. Through functional studies, we show that cancer cells that are infected with bacteria invade their surrounding environment as single cells and recruit myeloid cells to bacterial regions. Collectively, our data reveal that the distribution of the microbiota within a tumour is not random; instead, it is highly organized in microniches with immune and epithelial cell functions that promote cancer progression."

However, the effects of APOE4 on the human brain are not fully understood, limiting opportunities to develop targeted therapeutics for individuals carrying APOE4 and other risk factors for Alzheimer's disease4-8. Here, to gain more comprehensive insights into the impact of APOE4 on the human brain, we performed single-cell transcriptomics profiling of post-mortem human brains from APOE4 carriers compared with non-carriers. This revealed that APOE4 is associated with widespread gene expression changes across all cell types of the human brain. Consistent with the biological function of APOE2-6, APOE4 significantly altered signalling pathways associated with cholesterol homeostasis and transport. Confirming these findings with histological and lipidomic analysis of the post-mortem human brain, induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cells and targeted-replacement mice, we show that cholesterol is aberrantly deposited in oligodendrocytes-myelinating cells that are responsible for insulating and promoting the electrical activity of neurons. We show that altered cholesterol localization in the APOE4 brain coincides with reduced myelination. Pharmacologically facilitating cholesterol transport increases axonal myelination and improves learning and memory in APOE4 mice. We provide a single-cell atlas describing the transcriptional effects of APOE4 on the aging human brain and establish a functional link between APOE4, cholesterol, myelination and memory, offering therapeutic opportunities for Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W4309413232,"Immune-related adverse events, particularly severe toxicities such as myocarditis, are major challenges to the utility of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in anticancer therapy1. The pathogenesis of ICI-associated myocarditis (ICI-MC) is poorly understood. Pdcd1-/-Ctla4+/- mice recapitulate clinicopathological features of ICI-MC, including myocardial T cell infiltration2. Here, using single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of cardiac immune infiltrates from Pdcd1-/-Ctla4+/- mice, we identify clonal effector CD8+ T cells as the dominant cell population. Treatment with anti-CD8-depleting, but not anti-CD4-depleting, antibodies improved the survival of Pdcd1-/-Ctla4+/- mice. Adoptive transfer of immune cells from mice with myocarditis induced fatal myocarditis in recipients, which required CD8+ T cells. The cardiac-specific protein α-myosin, which is absent from the thymus3,4, was identified as the cognate antigen source for three major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted TCRs derived from mice with fulminant myocarditis. Peripheral blood T cells from three patients with ICI-MC were expanded by α-myosin peptides. Moreover, these α-myosin-expanded T cells shared TCR clonotypes with diseased heart and skeletal muscle, which indicates that α-myosin may be a clinically important autoantigen in ICI-MC. These studies underscore the crucial role for cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, identify a candidate autoantigen in ICI-MC and yield new insights into the pathogenesis of ICI toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W4309412280,"Abstract Bacteria have evolved diverse immunity mechanisms to protect themselves against the constant onslaught of bacteriophages 1–3 . Similar to how eukaryotic innate immune systems sense foreign invaders through pathogen-associated molecular patterns 4 (PAMPs), many bacterial immune systems that respond to bacteriophage infection require phage-specific triggers to be activated. However, the identities of such triggers and the sensing mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we identify and investigate the anti-phage function of CapRel SJ46 , a fused toxin–antitoxin system that protects Escherichia coli against diverse phages. Using genetic, biochemical and structural analyses, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of CapRel SJ46 regulates the toxic N-terminal region, serving as both antitoxin and phage infection sensor. Following infection by certain phages, newly synthesized major capsid protein binds directly to the C-terminal domain of CapRel SJ46 to relieve autoinhibition, enabling the toxin domain to pyrophosphorylate tRNAs, which blocks translation to restrict viral infection. Collectively, our results reveal the molecular mechanism by which a bacterial immune system directly senses a conserved, essential component of phages, suggesting a PAMP-like sensing model for toxin–antitoxin-mediated innate immunity in bacteria. We provide evidence that CapRels and their phage-encoded triggers are engaged in a ‘Red Queen conflict’ 5 , revealing a new front in the intense coevolutionary battle between phages and bacteria. Given that capsid proteins of some eukaryotic viruses are known to stimulate innate immune signalling in mammalian hosts 6–10 , our results reveal a deeply conserved facet of immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4309244224,"During recent decades, pathogens that originated in bats have become an increasing public health concern. A major challenge is to identify how those pathogens spill over into human populations to generate a pandemic threat1. Many correlational studies associate spillover with changes in land use or other anthropogenic stressors2,3, although the mechanisms underlying the observed correlations have not been identified4. One limitation is the lack of spatially and temporally explicit data on multiple spillovers, and on the connections among spillovers, reservoir host ecology and behaviour and viral dynamics. We present 25 years of data on land-use change, bat behaviour and spillover of Hendra virus from Pteropodid bats to horses in subtropical Australia. These data show that bats are responding to environmental change by persistently adopting behaviours that were previously transient responses to nutritional stress. Interactions between land-use change and climate now lead to persistent bat residency in agricultural areas, where periodic food shortages drive clusters of spillovers. Pulses of winter flowering of trees in remnant forests appeared to prevent spillover. We developed integrative Bayesian network models based on these phenomena that accurately predicted the presence or absence of clusters of spillovers in each of the 25 years. Our long-term study identifies the mechanistic connections between habitat loss, climate and increased spillover risk. It provides a framework for examining causes of bat virus spillover and for developing ecological countermeasures to prevent pandemics."

The leading approaches for on-chip pulse generation rely on mode-locking inside microresonators with either third-order nonlinearity10 or with semiconductor gain11,12. These approaches, however, are limited in noise performance, wavelength and repetition rate tunability 10,13. Alternatively, subpicosecond pulses can be synthesized without mode-locking, by modulating a continuous-wave single-frequency laser using electro-optic modulators1,14-17. Here we demonstrate a chip-scale femtosecond pulse source implemented on an integrated lithium niobate photonic platform18, using cascaded low-loss electro-optic amplitude and phase modulators and chirped Bragg grating, forming a time-lens system19. The device is driven by a continuous-wave distributed feedback laser chip and controlled by a single continuous-wave microwave source without the need for any stabilization or locking. We measure femtosecond pulse trains (520-femtosecond duration) with a 30-gigahertz repetition rate, flat-top optical spectra with a 10-decibel optical bandwidth of 12.6 nanometres, individual comb-line powers above 0.1 milliwatts, and pulse energies of 0.54 picojoules. Our results represent a tunable, robust and low-cost integrated pulsed light source with continuous-wave-to-pulse conversion efficiencies an order of magnitude higher than those achieved with previous integrated sources. Our pulse generator may find applications in fields such as ultrafast optical measurement19,20 or networks of distributed quantum computers21,22."
https://openalex.org/W4309411734,"Enteric pathogens are exposed to a dynamic polymicrobial environment in the gastrointestinal tract1. This microbial community has been shown to be important during infection, but there are few examples illustrating how microbial interactions can influence the virulence of invading pathogens2. Here we show that expansion of a group of antibiotic-resistant, opportunistic pathogens in the gut—the enterococci—enhances the fitness and pathogenesis of Clostridioides difficile. Through a parallel process of nutrient restriction and cross-feeding, enterococci shape the metabolic environment in the gut and reprogramme C. difficile metabolism. Enterococci provide fermentable amino acids, including leucine and ornithine, which increase C. difficile fitness in the antibiotic-perturbed gut. Parallel depletion of arginine by enterococci through arginine catabolism provides a metabolic cue for C. difficile that facilitates increased virulence. We find evidence of microbial interaction between these two pathogenic organisms in multiple mouse models of infection and patients infected with C. difficile. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of pathogenic microbiota in the susceptibility to and the severity of C. difficile infection. Enterococci enhance the fitness and pathogenesis of Clostridioides difficile in the gut by altering the amino acid composition and providing signals that increase its virulence towards the host."
https://openalex.org/W4309410174,"Aggregates of medin amyloid (a fragment of the protein MFG-E8, also known as lactadherin) are found in the vasculature of almost all humans over 50 years of age1,2, making it the most common amyloid currently known. We recently reported that medin also aggregates in blood vessels of ageing wild-type mice, causing cerebrovascular dysfunction3. Here we demonstrate in amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice and in patients with Alzheimer's disease that medin co-localizes with vascular amyloid-β deposits, and that in mice, medin deficiency reduces vascular amyloid-β deposition by half. Moreover, in both the mouse and human brain, MFG-E8 is highly enriched in the vasculature and both MFG-E8 and medin levels increase with the severity of vascular amyloid-β burden. Additionally, analysing data from 566 individuals in the ROSMAP cohort, we find that patients with Alzheimer's disease have higher MFGE8 expression levels, which are attributable to vascular cells and are associated with increased measures of cognitive decline, independent of plaque and tau pathology. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that medin interacts directly with amyloid-β to promote its aggregation, as medin forms heterologous fibrils with amyloid-β, affects amyloid-β fibril structure, and cross-seeds amyloid-β aggregation both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, medin could be a therapeutic target for prevention of vascular damage and cognitive decline resulting from amyloid-β deposition in the blood vessels of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W4309412773,"Teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize (Zea mays subsp. mays), has three times the seed protein content of most modern inbreds and hybrids, but the mechanisms that are responsible for this trait are unknown1,2. Here we use trio binning to create a contiguous haplotype DNA sequence of a teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis) and, through map-based cloning, identify a major high-protein quantitative trait locus, TEOSINTE HIGH PROTEIN 9 (THP9), on chromosome 9. THP9 encodes an asparagine synthetase 4 enzyme that is highly expressed in teosinte, but not in the B73 inbred, in which a deletion in the tenth intron of THP9-B73 causes incorrect splicing of THP9-B73 transcripts. Transgenic expression of THP9-teosinte in B73 significantly increased the seed protein content. Introgression of THP9-teosinte into modern maize inbreds and hybrids greatly enhanced the accumulation of free amino acids, especially asparagine, throughout the plant, and increased seed protein content without affecting yield. THP9-teosinte seems to increase nitrogen-use efficiency, which is important for promoting a high yield under low-nitrogen conditions. Genetic analyses of teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize, identify a locus (THP9) that is associated with high seed protein content and increased nitrogen-use efficiency, suggesting that THP9 could have applications in crop breeding."
https://openalex.org/W4309243984,"Solid cancers exhibit a dynamic balance between cell death and proliferation ensuring continuous tumour maintenance and growth1,2. Increasing evidence links enhanced cancer cell apoptosis to paracrine activation of cells in the tumour microenvironment initiating tissue repair programs that support tumour growth3,4, yet the direct effects of dying cancer cells on neighbouring tumour epithelia and how this paracrine effect potentially contributes to therapy resistance are unclear. Here we demonstrate that chemotherapy-induced tumour cell death in patient-derived colorectal tumour organoids causes ATP release triggering P2X4 (also known as P2RX4) to mediate an mTOR-dependent pro-survival program in neighbouring cancer cells, which renders surviving tumour epithelia sensitive to mTOR inhibition. The induced mTOR addiction in persisting epithelial cells is due to elevated production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent increased DNA damage in response to the death of neighbouring cells. Accordingly, inhibition of the P2X4 receptor or direct mTOR blockade prevents induction of S6 phosphorylation and synergizes with chemotherapy to cause massive cell death induced by reactive oxygen species and marked tumour regression that is not seen when individually applied. Conversely, scavenging of reactive oxygen species prevents cancer cells from becoming reliant on mTOR activation. Collectively, our findings show that dying cancer cells establish a new dependency on anti-apoptotic programs in their surviving neighbours, thereby creating an opportunity for combination therapy in P2X4-expressing epithelial tumours. Chemotherapy-induced death of colon cancer cells causes ATP release triggering P2X4 to mediate an mTOR-dependent pro-survival program in neighbouring cancer cells, which renders them sensitive to mTOR inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W3212037350,"Gamma band synchronization can facilitate local and long-range neural communication. In the primary visual cortex, visual stimulus properties within a specific location determine local synchronization strength, while the match of stimulus properties between distant locations controls long-range synchronization. The neural basis for the differential control of local and global gamma band synchronization is unknown. Combining electrophysiology, optogenetics, and computational modeling, we found that VIP disinhibitory interneurons in mouse cortex linearly scale gamma power locally without changing its stimulus tuning. Conversely, they suppress long-range synchronization when two regions process non-matched stimuli, tuning gamma coherence globally. Modeling shows that like-to-like connectivity across space and specific VIP→SST inhibition capture these opposing effects. VIP neurons thus differentially impact local and global properties of gamma rhythms depending on visual stimulus statistics. They may thereby construct gamma-band filters for spatially extended but continuous image features, such as contours, facilitating the downstream generation of coherent visual percepts."
https://openalex.org/W4309196491,"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) undergo an extensive and coordinated migration in the developing CNS, using the pre-formed scaffold of developed blood vessels as their physical substrate for migration. While OPC association with vasculature is critical for dispersal, equally important for permitting differentiation and proper myelination of target axons is their appropriate and timely detachment, but regulation of this process remains unclear. Here we demonstrate a correlation between the developmental formation of astrocytic endfeet on vessels and the termination of OPC perivascular migration. Ex vivo and in vivo live imaging shows that astrocyte endfeet physically displace OPCs from vasculature, and genetic abrogation of endfoot formation hinders both OPC detachment from vessels and subsequent differentiation. Astrocyte-derived semaphorins 3a and 6a act to repel OPCs from blood vessels at the cessation of their perivascular migration and, in so doing, permit subsequent OPC differentiation by insulating them from a maturation inhibitory endothelial niche."
https://openalex.org/W4309242782,"In aging, skeletal muscle strength and regenerative capacity decline, due in part to functional impairment of muscle stem cells (MuSCs), yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we capitalize on mass cytometry to identify high CD47 expression as a hallmark of dysfunctional MuSCs (CD47hi) with impaired regenerative capacity that predominate with aging. The prevalent CD47hi MuSC subset suppresses the residual functional CD47lo MuSC subset through a paracrine signaling loop, leading to impaired proliferation. We uncover that elevated CD47 levels on aged MuSCs result from increased U1 snRNA expression, which disrupts alternative polyadenylation. The deficit in aged MuSC function in regeneration can be overcome either by morpholino-mediated blockade of CD47 alternative polyadenylation or antibody blockade of thrombospondin-1/CD47 signaling, leading to improved regeneration in aged mice, with therapeutic implications. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized age-dependent alteration in CD47 levels and function in MuSCs, which underlies reduced muscle repair in aging."
https://openalex.org/W4309338407,"In many regions of the world, sparse data on key economic outcomes inhibit the development, targeting and evaluation of public policy1,2. We demonstrate how advancements in satellite imagery and machine learning (ML) can help ameliorate these data and inference challenges. In the context of an expansion of the electrical grid across Uganda, we show how a combination of satellite imagery and computer vision can be used to develop local-level livelihood measurements appropriate for inferring the causal impact of electricity access on livelihoods. We then show how ML-based inference techniques deliver more reliable estimates of the causal impact of electrification than traditional alternatives when applied to these data. We estimate that grid access improves village-level asset wealth in rural Uganda by up to 0.15 standard deviations, more than doubling the growth rate during our study period relative to untreated areas. Our results provide country-scale evidence on the impact of grid-based infrastructure investment and our methods provide a low-cost, generalizable approach to future policy evaluation in data-sparse environments."
https://openalex.org/W4309624388,"Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are widely used for navigation and time distribution1–3, features that are indispensable for critical infrastructure such as mobile communication networks, as well as emerging technologies such as automated driving and sustainable energy grids3,4. Although GNSS can provide centimetre-level precision, GNSS receivers are prone to many-metre errors owing to multipath propagation and an obstructed view of the sky, which occur particularly in urban areas where accurate positioning is most needed1,5,6. Moreover, the vulnerabilities of GNSS, combined with the lack of a back-up system, pose a severe risk to GNSS-dependent technologies7. Here we demonstrate a terrestrial positioning system that is independent of GNSS and offers superior performance through a constellation of radio transmitters, connected and time-synchronized at the subnanosecond level through a fibre-optic Ethernet network8. Using optical and wireless transmission schemes similar to those encountered in mobile communication networks, and exploiting spectrally efficient virtual wideband signals, the detrimental effects of multipath propagation are mitigated9, thus enabling robust decimetre-level positioning and subnanosecond timing in a multipath-prone outdoor environment. This work provides a glimpse of a future in which telecommunication networks provide not only connectivity but also GNSS-independent timing and positioning services with unprecedented accuracy and reliability. A terrestrial networked positioning system based on a hybrid optical–wireless telecommunication infrastructure and that is independent of global navigation satellite systems is demonstrated for urban environments with decimetre-level accuracy."

Methods Participants of this study were the RD who were infected at the beginning of the outbreak from 13 communities in Jianghan District of Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China by convenience sampling in mid-2021. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire , the Short Version of COVID-19 Stigma Scale, the Peace of Mind Scale, the Resilience Style Questionnaire, and the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire were used to collect relevant information of the participants. Descriptive analyses, Pearson correlation analysis, and logistic regression analysis were used to describe and analyze the data and to examine the factors associated with the mental health status of this population. Results In total, we recruited 1601 participants from 3059 COVID-19 patients, and 1541 participants completed the questionnaire survey, with a response rate of 96.25%. Finally, 1297 participants met the inclusion and exclusion criteria in this study, of whom 28.8% and 37.9% reported mild to severe levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Perceived better mental health status during hospitalization, higher frequency of alcohol use per week, peace of mind, higher education level, and resilience were negatively associated with anxiety, while stigma and history of psychological or emotional counseling before infection was positively associated with anxiety. More severe clinical classification of COVID-19 and stigma (AOR = 1.057, P&lt;0.001) were both positively associated with depression, while perceived better mental health status during hospitalization (AOR = 0.564, P&lt;0.001), higher frequency of alcohol use per week (AOR = 0.462, P = 0.004), peace of mind (AOR = 0.857, P&lt;0.001), and social support (AOR = 0.972, P = 0.034) were negatively associated with depression. Conclusions Tailored interventions on reducing stigma, enhancing mindfulness and social support should be taken into account to alleviate anxiety and depression among RD."

https://openalex.org/W4309135076,"Measures to restrict physical inter-personal contact in the community have been widely implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied determinants for infection with SARS-CoV-2 with the aim of informing future public health measures. We conducted a national matched case-control study among unvaccinated not previously infected adults aged 18-49 years. Cases were selected among those testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR over a five-day period in June 2021. Controls were selected from the national population register and were individually matched on age, sex and municipality of residence. Cases and controls were interviewed via telephone about contact with other persons and exposures in the community. We determined matched odds ratios (mORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) by conditional logistical regression with adjustment for household size and immigration status. For reference, we provide a timeline of non-pharmaceutical interventions in place in Denmark from February 2020 to March 2022. We included 500 cases and 529 controls. We found that having had contact with another individual with a known infection was the main determinant for SARS-CoV-2 infection: reporting close contact with an infected person who either had or did not have symptoms resulted in mORs of 20 (95%CI:9.8-39) and 8.5 (95%CI 4.5-16) respectively. Community exposures were generally not associated with disease; several exposures were negatively associated. Consumption of alcohol in restaurants or cafés, aOR = 2.3 (95%CI:1.3-4.2) and possibly attending fitness centers, mOR = 1.4 (95%CI:1.0-2.0) were weakly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Apart from these two factors, no community activities were more common amongst cases under the community restrictions in place during the study. The strongest risk factor for transmission was contact to an infected person. Results were in agreement with findings of our similar study conducted six month earlier."

There is little is known about how severity of COVID-19 changes protein and metabolite expression in pregnancy.This study aims to investigate the pathophysiology behind various clinical trajectories in pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using multi-omics profiling.This is a prospective cohort study of 30 pregnant patients at a single tertiary care center. Participants were categorized by severity of COVID-19 disease (control, asymptomatic, mild/moderate, or severe). Maternal serum samples underwent LC-MS-based multiomics analysis for profiling of proteins, lipids, electrolytes, and metabolites. Linear regression models were used to assess how disease severity related to analyte levels. Reactome pathway enrichment analysis was conducted on differential analytes.Of 30 participants, 25 had confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (6 asymptomatic (one post-infection), 13 mild/moderate (all post-infection), 6 severe), and 5 participants were controls. Severe COVID-19 was associated with distinct profiles demonstrating significant proteomic and lipidomic signatures which were enriched for annotations related to complement and antibody activity. (FDR < 0.05). Downregulated analytes were not significantly enriched but consisted of annotation terms related to lipoprotein activity (FDR > 0.2). Post-infection mild/moderate COVID-19 did not have significantly altered serum protein, metabolite, or lipid metabolite levels compared to controls.Pregnancies with severe COVID-19 demonstrate greater inflammation and complement activation and dysregulation of serum lipids. This altered multiomic expression provides insight into the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 in pregnancy and may serve as potential indicators for adverse pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4309135088,"A therapy for COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains elusive due to the lack of an effective antiviral therapeutic molecule. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which plays a vital role in the viral life cycle, is one of the most studied and validated drug targets. In Several prior studies, numerous possible chemical entities were proposed as potential Mpro inhibitors; however, most failed at various stages of drug discovery. Repositioning of existing antiviral compounds accelerates the discovery and development of potent therapeutic molecules. Hence, this study examines the applicability of anti-dengue compounds against the substrate binding site of Mpro for disrupting its polyprotein processing mechanism. An in-silico structure-based virtual screening approach is applied to screen 330 experimentally validated anti-dengue compounds to determine their affinity to the substrate binding site of Mpro. This study identified the top five compounds (CHEMBL1940602, CHEMBL2036486, CHEMBL3628485, CHEMBL200972, CHEMBL2036488) that showed a high affinity to Mpro with a docking score > -10.0 kcal/mol. The best-docked pose of these compounds with Mpro was subjected to 100 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation followed by MM/GBSA binding energy. This showed the maximum stability and comparable ΔG binding energy against the reference compound (X77 inhibitor).

In this study, we further explored how these polyphenol-rich plant extracts solutions behave in the presence of fluoride. We distributed enamel specimens into 9 groups (n = 15): Control_No_F- (Deionized water); Control_F- (500 ppm F-), Grape_Seed_No_F- (Grape seed extract), Grape_Seed_F- (Grape seed extract + 500 ppm F-), Grapefruit_Seed_No_F- (Grapefruit seed extract), Grapefruit_Seed_F- (Grapefruit seed extract + 500 ppm F-), Blueberry_No_F- (Blueberry extract), Blueberry_F- (Blueberry extract + 500 ppm F-), and Sn2+/F-_Rinse (commercial solution containing 800 ppm Sn2+ and 500 ppm F-). The specimens were submitted to 5 cycles (1 cycle per day), and each cycle consisted of: salivary pellicle formation (human saliva, 30 min, 37°C), modification of the pellicle (2 min, 25°C), pellicle formation (60 min, 37°C), and an erosive challenge (1 min, citric acid). Between cycles, the specimens were kept in a humid chamber. Relative surface hardness (rSH), relative surface reflection intensity (rSRI) and calcium released to the acid were analysed, using general linear models, and Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Dunn's tests. We observed that the presence of fluoride in synergy with the extract solutions provided better protection than the groups containing extract or fluoride only. For rSH, we observed a significant main effect of extracts (F(4,117) = 9.20; p<0.001) and fluoride (F(1,117) = 511.55; p<0.001), with a significant interaction (F(3,117) = 6.71; p<0.001). Grape_Seed_F- showed the best protection, better than fluoride, and Sn2+/F-_Rinse. Calcium results also showed greater protection for the groups containing fluoride, whereas for rSRI, despite a significant interaction between extract and fluoride (F(3,117) = 226.05; p<0.001), the differences between the groups were not as clearly observed. We conclude that polyphenols from plant extracts, when combined with fluoride, improve the protective effect of salivary pellicles against enamel erosion."

https://openalex.org/W4309135135,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in communication, and social skills, as well as repetitive and/or restrictive interests and behaviors. The severity of ASD varies from mild to severe, drastically interfering with the quality of life of affected individuals. The current occurrence of ASD in the United States is about 1 in 44 children. The precise pathophysiology of ASD is still unknown, but it is believed that ASD is heterogeneous and can arise due to genetic etiology. Although various genes have been implicated in predisposition to ASD, metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is one of the most common downstream targets, which may be involved in autism. mGluR5 signaling has been shown to play a crucial role in neurodevelopment and neural transmission making it a very attractive target for understanding the pathogenesis of ASD. In the present study, we determined the effect of genetic ablation of mGluR5 ( Grm5 ) on an ASD-like phenotype using a rat model to better understand the role of mGluR5 signaling in behavior patterns and clinical manifestations of ASD. We observed that mGluR5 Ko rats exhibited exaggerated self-grooming and increased marble burying, as well as deficits in social novelty. Our results suggest that mGluR5 Ko rats demonstrate an ASD-like phenotype, specifically impaired social interaction as well as repetitive and anxiety-like behavior, which are correlates of behavior symptoms observed in individuals with ASD. The mGluR5 Ko rat model characterized in this study may be explored to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying ASD and for developing effective therapeutic modalities."
https://openalex.org/W4309135142,"Background Chinese populations have been reported higher incidence of all strokes and intracerebral hemorrhage. However, few large-scale studies have evaluated changes of stroke epidemiology in the 21st century. Methods We explored the rates of incidence of all first-ever strokes, subtypes, and 1-month case fatality by using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database since 2004. Also, we investigated sex differences in stroke. Time-trend analysis was performed for incidence and case fatality rates of all strokes and subtypes in both sexes. Results The age-adjusted incidence of all strokes per 100,000 person-years decreased by 16%, from 251 (95% confidence interval [CI] 249–253) in 2004 to 210 (95% CI 209–212) in 2011 (p&lt;0.001); it was always higher in Chinese men than in women. Among pathological subtypes, the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage markedly decreased by 26% over the years (p&lt;0.001), while that of ischemic stroke slightly decreased by 8%. However, when stratified by sex, the incidence of ischemic stroke decreased significantly in only women, not in men (men: p = 0.399, women: p = 0.004). Regarding the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, it remained unchanged. Furthermore, the rate of 1-month case fatality decreased significantly for all strokes in both sexes (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions In Taiwan, the incidence rate of first-ever stroke decreased in both Chinese men and women in the early 21st century. Men had a higher incidence rate than women. Furthermore, a marked decrease was noted in the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage, while a slight decrease was noted in that of ischemic stroke; however, the decreased incidence of ischemic stroke was significant in only women."
https://openalex.org/W4309138787,"Objectives To investigate the cost-effectiveness of abatacept (ABA) as first-line (1L) therapy in Japanese rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients using data from the Institute of Rheumatology, Rheumatoid Arthritis database. Methods A decision-analytic model was used to estimate the cost per American College of Rheumatology response of at least 50% improvement (ACR50) responder and per patient in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) remission from a Japanese healthcare payers’ perspective over a 2-year time horizon. Clinical characteristics of patients on ABA-1L were matched with those of patients on ABA second or later line (2L+) or tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi)-1L directly or using propensity scores. Resource utilisation and medical costs were calculated from the Japan Medical Data Center claims database. Parameter uncertainty was addressed by sensitivity and subgroup analyses (age, treatment duration, Japanese version of Health Assessment Questionnaire [J-HAQ] score). Results Incremental costs per member per month (ΔPMPM) for ABA-1L versus TNFi-1L and ABA-2L+ were -1,571 Japanese Yen (JPY) and 81 JPY, respectively. For ABA-1L versus TNFi-1L, ΔPMPM by ACR50 response was -11,715 JPY and by CDAI and SDAI remission 11,602 JPY and 47,003 JPY, respectively. Corresponding costs for ABA-1L were lower for all outcome parameters versus those for ABA-2L+. Scenario analyses showed that ABA-1L was cost-effective over TNFi-1L in patients &lt;65 years for any outcome. Furthermore, ABA-1L was cost-effective over ABA-2L+ for all outcomes in patients with age &lt;65 years, disease duration &lt;5 years and J-HAQ ≥1.5. Conclusions ABA-1L demonstrated a favourable cost-effectiveness profile in RA patients, accruing savings for the Japanese healthcare payers."
https://openalex.org/W4309150757,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may cause severe life-threatening diseases called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) owing to cytokine storms. The mortality rate of COVID-19-related ARDS is as high as 40% to 50%. However, effective treatment for the extensive release of acute inflammatory mediators induced by hyperactive and inappropriate immune responses is very limited. Many anti-inflammatory drugs with variable efficacies have been investigated. Colchicine inhibits interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and its subsequent inflammatory cascade by primarily blocking pyrin and nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing receptor 3 (NLRP3) activation. Therefore, this cheap, widely available, oral drug might provide an added benefit in combating the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Here, we sought to determine whether adding colchicine to other standards of care could be beneficial for moderate COVID-19 pneumonia in terms of the requirement for advanced respiratory support and mortality.This blinded placebo-controlled drug trial was conducted at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total of 300 patients with moderate COVID-19 based on a positive RT-PCR result were enrolled based on strict selection criteria from June 2020 to November 2020. Patients were randomly assigned to either treatment group in a 1:1 ratio. Patients were administered 1.2 mg of colchicine on day 1 followed by daily treatment with 0.6 mg of colchicine for 13 days or placebo along with the standard of care. The primary outcome was the time to clinical deterioration from randomization to two or more points on a seven-category ordinal scale within the 14 days post-randomization. Clinical outcomes were also recorded on day 28. The primary endpoint was met by 9 (6.2%) patients in the placebo group and 4 (2.7%) patients in the colchicine group (P = 0.171), which corresponds to a hazard ratio (95% CI) of 0.44 (0.13-1.43). Additional analysis of the outcomes on day 28 revealed significantly lower clinical deterioration (defined as a decrease by two or more points) in the colchicine group, with a hazard ratio [95%CI] of 0.29 [0.098-0.917], (P = 0.035). Despite a 56% reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation and death with colchicine treatment on day 14, the reduction was not statistically significant. On day 28, colchicine significantly reduced clinical deterioration measured as the need for mechanical ventilation and all-cause mortality.Colchicine was not found to have a significant beneficial effect on reducing mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation. However, a delayed beneficial effect was observed. Therefore, further studies should be conducted to evaluate the late benefits of colchicine.Clinical trial registration no: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04527562 https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=NCT04527562."

https://openalex.org/W4309134920,"During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns were raised about reduced attendance at hospitals, particularly in paediatric emergency departments, which could result in preventable poorer outcomes and late presentations among children requiring emergency care. We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on health-seeking behaviour and decision-making processes of caregivers presenting to paediatric emergency services at a National Health Service (NHS) Trust in London.We conducted a mixed-methods study (survey and semi-structured interviews) across two hospital sites between November-December 2020. Data from each study were collected concurrently followed by data comparison.Overall, 100 caregivers participated in our study; 80 completed the survey only, two completed the interview only and 18 completed both. Our quantitative study found that almost two-thirds (63%, n = 62) of caregivers attended the department within two days of their child becoming ill. Our qualitative study identified three major themes which were underpinned by concepts of trust, safety and uncertainty and were assessed in relation to the temporal nature of the pandemic and the caregivers' journey to care. We found most caregivers balanced their concerns of COVID-19 and a perceived ""overwhelmed"" NHS by speaking to trusted sources, predominantly general practitioners (GPs).Caregivers have adapted their health-seeking behaviour throughout the pandemic as new information and guidance have been released. We identified several factors affecting decisions to attend; some existed before the pandemic (e.g., concerns for child's health) whilst others were due to the pandemic (e.g., perceived risks of transmission when accessing healthcare services). We recommend trusted medical professionals, particularly GPs, continue to provide reassurance to caregivers to seek emergency paediatric care when required. Communicating the hospital safety procedures and the importance of early intervention to caregivers could additionally provide reassurance to those concerned about the risks of accessing the hospital environment."
https://openalex.org/W4309135054,"Sleep duration, quality, and rest-activity pattern—a measure for inferring circadian rhythm—are influenced by multiple factors including access to electricity. Recent findings suggest that the safety and comfort afforded by technology may improve sleep but negatively impact rest-activity stability. According to the circadian entrainment hypothesis, increased access to electric lighting should lead to weaker and less uniform circadian rhythms, measured by stability of rest-activity patterns. Here, we investigate sleep in a Maya community in Guatemala who are in a transitional stage of industrialization. We predicted that (i) sleep will be shorter and less efficient in this population than in industrial settings, and that (ii) rest-activity patterns will be weaker and less stable than in contexts with greater exposure to the natural environment and stronger and more stable than in settings more buffered by technologic infrastructure. Our results were mixed. Compared to more industrialized settings, in our study population sleep was 4.87% less efficient (78.39% vs 83.26%). We found no significant difference in sleep duration. Rest-activity patterns were more uniform and less variable than in industrial settings (interdaily stability = 0.58 vs 0.43; intradaily variability = 0.53 vs 0.60). Our results suggest that industrialization does not inherently reduce characteristics of sleep quality; instead, the safety and comfort afforded by technological development may improve sleep, and an intermediate degree of environmental exposure and technological buffering may support circadian rhythm strength and stability."
https://openalex.org/W4309135055,"Background The norovirus is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis at all ages but particularly has a high chance of affecting children under the age of five. Given that the outbreak of norovirus in Korea is seasonal, it is important to try and predict the start and end of norovirus outbreaks. Methods We predicted weekly norovirus warnings using six machine learning algorithms using test data from 2017 to 2018 and training data from 2009 to 2016. In addition, we proposed a novel method for the early detection of norovirus using a calculated norovirus risk index. Further, feature importance was calculated to evaluate the contribution of the estimated weekly norovirus warnings. Results The long short-term memory machine learning (LSTM) algorithm proved to be the best algorithm for predicting weekly norovirus warnings, with 97.2% and 92.5% accuracy in the training and test data, respectively. The LSTM algorithm predicted the observed start and end weeks of the early detection of norovirus within a 3-week range. Conclusions The results of this study show that early detection can provide important insights for the preparation and control of norovirus outbreaks by the government. Our method provides indicators of high-risk weeks. In particular, last norovirus detection rate, minimum temperature, and day length, play critical roles in estimating weekly norovirus warnings."
https://openalex.org/W4309135071,"This study aims to reveal whether the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) increases in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) patients, and to determine ONSD is associated with the poor prognosis of patients with HE.In this retrospective case-control study, HE patients who underwent cranial computerized tomography (CT) were included in the case group; and the patients who underwent CT for other reasons for the same age and gender and were normally interpreted were included in the control group. ONSD measurements in the case and control groups and clinical grades of HE with in-hospital mortality and ONSD measurements were compared in the case group.This study was done with 74 acute HE patients and 74 control patients. The mean age was 62.9 ± 11.0 years and 67.6% of patients were male in both groups. The ONSD in the case group was higher than the control group (5.27-mm ± 0.82 vs 4.73 mm ± 0.57, p <0.001). In the case group, the ONSD was 5.30 mm ± 0.87 in survivors, and 5.21 ± 0.65 in non-survivors (P = 0.670). There was no significant difference between the West Haven HE grade (P = 0.348) and Child-Pugh Score (P = 0.505) with ONSD measurements.We have shown that ONSD increases in HE patients compared to the control group. ONSD was not related to the Child-Pugh Score, HE grade, and in-hospital mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4309135121,"A unique historical architecture was created at Shuri Castle ( Shuri-jo ) in the Ryukyu Islands by its “Kawara” roof tiles. After the 13th and 14th centuries, Kawara tiles were introduced to the Ryukyu Islands from several regions, including China, Korea, and mainland Japan, and evolved shapes and patterns that are unique to this island region. However, the transition of some internal features, such as the chemical components and microstructure, had not been analyzed. This study used a multi-faceted approach for such internal data and non-destructive quantitative methods to propose a new perspective on the evolution of historical Ryukyuan Kawara. We analyzed two styles of Ryukyuan Kawara from the 13th to 15th centuries and found that the material processing and firing conditions of the two styles were very similar, even though it had been suggested that they had different origins. A quantitative analysis of tiles from the 16th to 19th centuries revealed a transition in color tone to red, leading to the modern traditional Ryukyuan tiles; traces of changes in firing conditions were also found along with this transition. Finally, the study revealed that the evolution of Ryukyuan Kawara consisted of changed factors, e.g. surface color, and unchanged factors, e.g. paste density. Previous archaeological studies mainly focused on changing external characteristics, such as form and pattern; however, our analysis showed that the internal features changed, while the elemental composition and paste density remained constant from the appearance of the roof tiles until the 19th century. We propose that this is related to different responses of individual factors to external stressors, such as the social context, which may be common to other archaeological artifacts as well. Our study provides a new perspective on the evolution of Ryukyuan Kawara and presents a different discussion of and methods for the chronological study of material culture."
https://openalex.org/W4309135143,"E26 transformation specific (ETS) family transcription factors are expressed during embryogenesis and are involved in various cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and survival of cellular lineages to ensure appropriate development. Dysregulated expression of many of the ETS family members is detected in different cancers. The human ELF3, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, plays a role in the induction and progression of human cancers is well studied. However, little is known about the role of ELF3 in early development. Here, the zebrafish elf3 was cloned, and its expression was analyzed during zebrafish development. Zebrafish elf3 is maternally deposited. At different developmental stages, elf3 expression was detected in different tissue, mainly neural tissues, endoderm-derived tissues, cartilage, heart, pronephric duct, blood vessels, and notochord. The expression levels were high at the tissue boundaries. Elf3 loss-of-function consequences were examined by using translation blocking antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, and effects were validated using CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown. Elf3-knockdown produced short and bent larvae with notochord, craniofacial cartilage, and fin defects. The extracellular matrix (ECM) in the fin and notochord was disorganized. Neural defects were also observed. Optic nerve fasciculation (bundling) and arborization in the optic tectum were defective in Elf3-morphants, and fragmentation of spinal motor neurons were evident. Dysregulation of genes encoding ECM proteins and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) and disorganization of ECM may play a role in the observed defects in Elf3 morphants. We conclude that zebrafish Elf3 is required for epidermal, mesenchymal, and neural tissue development."
https://openalex.org/W4309150799,"Background In many of the risk estimation algorithms for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), heart rate and systolic blood pressure are key predictors. Yet, these parameters may also be altered by the applied medical treatment / circulatory support without concomitant improvement in microcirculation. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether venous lactate level, a well-known marker of microcirculatory failure, may have an added prognostic value on top of the conventional variables of the “Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events” (GRACE) 2.0 model for predicting 30-day all-cause mortality of STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods In a prospective single-center registry study conducted from May 2020 through April 2021, we analyzed data of 323 cases. Venous blood gas analysis was performed in all patients at admission. Nested logistic regression models were built using the GRACE 2.0 score alone (base model) and with the addition of venous lactate level (expanded model) with 30-day all-cause mortality as primary outcome measure. Difference in model performance was analyzed by the likelihood ratio (LR) test and the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Independence of the predictors was evaluated by the variance inflation factor (VIF). Discrimination and calibration was characterized by the c-statistic and calibration intercept / slope, respectively. Results Addition of lactate level to the GRACE 2.0 score improved the predictions of 30-day mortality significantly as assessed by both LR test (LR Chi-square = 8.7967, p = 0.0030) and IDI (IDI = 0.0685, p = 0.0402), suggesting that the expanded model may have better predictive ability than the GRACE 2.0 score. Furthermore, the VIF was 1.1203, indicating that the measured lactate values were independent of the calculated GRACE 2.0 scores. Conclusions Our results suggest that admission venous lactate level and the GRACE 2.0 score may be independent and additive predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality of STEMI patients treated with primary PCI."

https://openalex.org/W4309135021,"Mast seeding and associated events in Melocanna baccifera, the largest fruit producing bamboo, is an enigma. So far there are no comprehensive accounts on its flowering phenology, fruiting dynamics and animal interactions. In this study, spanning over 13 years (2009 to 2022), we observed eight M. baccifera clumps in JNTBGRI Bambusetum from flowering initiation, fruiting to eventual death. Flowering phenology, floral characteristics, floret types, breeding system, bee visitation, pollination, fruit production and predators were recorded; predation patterns were correlated with fruit chemistry. Flowering duration of clumps ranged from 20 (March 2009-October 2010) to 120 (September 2012-August 2022) months. Bisexual florets are dichogamous and protogynous; and female duration (22-72 h) is many times higher than male duration (2-6 h). The highest ever fruit production for an individual bamboo clump (456.67 Kg) was recorded. Of the total fallen fruits (38371), 38.11% were predated, 43.80% good fruits (no predator hits) and 18.09% immature fruits. A positive correlation between reward (fruits) versus predation was observed, especially in short intervals of high fruit production. Pollen predators (Apis cerana indica, Halictus taprabonae, Braunsapis cupulifera, Trigona iridipennis), fruit predators, ranging from arthropods to mammals, viz., millipede (Spinotarsus colosseus), slug (Mariaella dussumieri), snails (Cryptozona bistrialis, Macrochlamys sp.), borers (Achroia grisella, Blattella germanica), mammals (monkeys Macaca radiata, rats Rattus rattus, porcupine Hystrix indica, wild boar Sus scrofa, palm civet Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), seedling predators (rabbit Lepus nigricollis, deer Axis axis), and insect/pest predators (ants Crematogaster biroi, Oecophylla smaragdina, mantis Euchomenella indica) were identified. Fruit predation is linked to its age and chemistry. Apart from new insights on flowering phenology, breeding system, pollination and fruiting dynamics, this study demonstrates the vibrant interaction between M. baccifera flowers/fruits and visitors/predators, and provides significant leads towards elucidating the cause of rat multiplication and other events associated with its gregarious flowering."
https://openalex.org/W4309135056,"Background Large cell transformation (LCT) of Sezary Syndrome (SS) is a rare phenomenon. To date, there are no rigorous studies identifying risk factors for its development. Objectives Here, we seek to characterize the clinicopathologic risk factors that predispose patients with SS to develop LCT. Methods We retrospectively evaluated all SS patient records available in the Michigan Medicine Cancer Registry from 2010–2021. Clinical and pathologic variables were compared between groups. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to assess overall survival. Results Of 28 SS patients identified, eight patients experienced LCT, and 20 did not (NLCT). Peak lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) before LCT (p = 0.0012), maximum total body surface area (TBSA) involvement before LCT (p = 0.0114), absolute CD8+ cell count measured on flow cytometry at diagnosis of SS (p = 0.0455) and at the most recent blood draw (p = 0.00736), and ulceration on biopsy (p = 0.0034) were significant clinicopathologic variables identified between the SS patients that developed LCT versus those that did not. Conclusions Maximum TBSA involvement, peak LDH, presence of ulceration, and decreased levels of CD8+ cells in the peripheral blood may predict the development of LCT in patients with SS."

https://openalex.org/W4309138815,"As global temperatures continue to rise, population or spatial synchrony (i.e., the degree of synchronization in the fluctuation of demographic parameters) can have important implications for inter- and intraspecific interactions among wildlife populations. Climatic fluctuations are common drivers of spatial synchrony, and depending on the degree of synchronization and the parameters impacted, synchrony can increase extinction probabilities. Although citizen science is an inexpensive method to collect long-term data over large spatial scales to study effects of climate changes on wildlife, few studies have used citizen science data to determine if this synchrony is occurring across populations and species. We used 21 years of citizen science nesting data collected on Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) and Carolina Chickadees (Poecile carolinensis), two widespread North American species with similar life histories and abundant data, to assess the degree of synchrony between and within their populations in the southeastern United States. We found little evidence of synchronous fluctuations in the nesting parameters of hatching success, hatchability, and fledging success between and within species, nor did we observe consistent patterns towards increased or decreased synchrony. Estimates of nesting parameters were high (≥ 0.83) and showed little variability (relative variance ≤ 0.17), supporting the hypothesis that parameters that strongly contribute to population growth rates (i.e., typically fecundity in short-lived species) show little interannual variability. The low variability and lack of synchrony suggest that these populations of study species may be resilient to climate change. However, we were unable to test for synchronous fluctuations in other species and populations, or in the survival parameter, due to large gaps in data. This highlights the need for citizen science projects to continue increasing public participation for species and regions that lack data."
https://openalex.org/W4309150759,"While factors contributing to between-subjects differences in pain have been studied extensively, factors contributing to the within-subjects variability of pain reports are yet unexplored. The aim of this investigation was to assess possible associations between short-term memory and the within-subjects variability of pain reports in healthy and chronic pain patients. Healthy participants were recruited at the University of Haifa, Israel, and Fibromyalgia patients were recruited at a rheumatology department in a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. Following consent, both cohorts underwent the same procedures, including the digit-span test, assessing short-term memory, and the FAST procedure, assessing within-subject variability of pain intensity reports in response to experimental pain. One-hundred twenty-one healthy volunteers and 29 Fibromyalgia patients completed the study. While a significant correlation was found between the within-subjects variability and the total score of the short-term memory task (Spearman’s r = 0.394, P = 0.046) in the Fibromyalgia group, a marginal correlation emerged in the healthy cohort ( r = 0.174, P = 0.056). A possible interpretation of these results is that in the patients’ group, at least some of the within-subjects variability of pain intensity reports might be due to error measurement derived by poorer short-term memory, rather than true fluctuations in perception."
