https://openalex.org/W2000882985,"The turbidity maximum near the head of the Chesapeake Bay is produced primarily by the local resuspension of bottom sediments, and by the estuarine ""sediment trap"" which is formed in the upper reaches of the estuarine circulation regime by the net nontidal circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1985049759,"The Antarctic ice sheet at Byrd Station has been core-drilled to bedrock; the vertical thickness of the ice is 2164 meters. Liquid water-indicative of pressure melting-was encountered at the bed. Heat flow through the base of the ice sheet is estimated at 1.8 microcalories per square centimeter per second. The minimum temperature was -28.8 degrees C at 800 meters; maximum ice density, 0.9206 at 1000 meters. Core studies reveal the existence of a chemically pure, structurally stratified sheet comprising bubbly ice to 900 meters that transforms to bubble-free deformed ice, with substantially vertically orientated c-axis structure, below 1200 meters. Below 1800 meters the deformed ice structure gives way to large annealed crystals. Several thin layers of dirt between 1300 and 1700 meters are tentatively identified as volcanic ash, and horizontally banded debris, including fragments of granite, is present in the basal ice."
https://openalex.org/W2038978584,"Spheroidal and cupshaped, carbonaceous alga-like bodies, as well as filamentous structures and amorphous carbonaceous matter occur in sedimentary rocks of the Onverwacht Series (Swaziland System) in South Africa. The Onverwacht sediments are older than 3.2 eons, and they are probably the oldest, littlealtered sedimentary rocks on Earth. The basal Onverwacht sediments lie approximately 10,000 meters stratigraphically below the Fig Tree sedimentary rocks, from which similar organic microstructures have been interpreted as alga-like microfossils. The Onverwacht spheroids and filaments are best preserved in black, carbonrich cherts and siliceous argillites interlayered with thick sequences of lavas. These lifelike forms and the associated carbonaceous substances are probably biological in origin. If so, the origins of unicellular life on Earth are buried in older rocks now obliterated by igneous and metamorphic events."
https://openalex.org/W2057105403,"The classical assumptions, upon which all previous phylogenies for the lower plants (Thallophytes) have been based, are claimed to be erroneous. An alternative view, that the eukaryotic cell arose in the late Precambrian from prokaryotic ancestors by a specific series of symbioses, is referred to here. Mutually consistent phylogenies, one for the prokaryotes, another for the lower eukaryotes, can be constructed on the basis of the symbiotic theory. The resulting prokaryote phylogeny is presented here; it is claimed to be more consistent with cytological data, measured DNA base ratios, and the fossil record than the several classical partial phylogenies for Thallophytes recently published."

https://openalex.org/W1988321875,Study of deep seismic reflections has detected a Precambrian rift valley below flat-lying sediments in southern Alberta. The anomalous magnetic and gravity trends show that the rift is continuous across Alberta and British Columbia (through the Kimberley lead-zinc field) and possibly the Coeur d'Alene mining district of Idaho. There is evidence that these ore bodies were deposited in a Precambrian rift under conditions similar to those prevailing in the hot-brine areas of the modern Red Sea.

https://openalex.org/W2069473878,"Neutron activation of glassy separates of volcanic ash resulted in 21 nuclides measurable with instrumental techniques. The relative activities of most of the nuclides distinguish samples from Mount Mazama, Newberry Crater, and Glacier Peak. The usefulness of the technique was assessed by comparing the values for known sources with those from fine ash of uncertain origin. The data strongly suggest Mount Mazama as the source."
