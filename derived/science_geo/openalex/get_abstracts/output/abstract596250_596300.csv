APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease. ApoE4 increases brain amyloid-β pathology compared to other ApoE isoforms. However, whether APOE independently influences tau pathology is not clear. David Holtzman and colleagues now show that ApoE4 exacerbates tau pathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration independent of amyloid-β pathology. ApoE4 exerts a 'toxic' gain of function, whereas the absence of ApoE is protective. APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease. ApoE4 increases brain amyloid-β pathology relative to other ApoE isoforms1. However, whether APOE independently influences tau pathology, the other major proteinopathy of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, or tau-mediated neurodegeneration, is not clear. By generating P301S tau transgenic mice on either a human ApoE knock-in (KI) or ApoE knockout (KO) background, here we show that P301S/E4 mice have significantly higher tau levels in the brain and a greater extent of somatodendritic tau redistribution by three months of age compared with P301S/E2, P301S/E3, and P301S/EKO mice. By nine months of age, P301S mice with different ApoE genotypes display distinct phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) staining patterns. P301S/E4 mice develop markedly more brain atrophy and neuroinflammation than P301S/E2 and P301S/E3 mice, whereas P301S/EKO mice are largely protected from these changes. In vitro, E4-expressing microglia exhibit higher innate immune reactivity after lipopolysaccharide treatment. Co-culturing P301S tau-expressing neurons with E4-expressing mixed glia results in a significantly higher level of tumour-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion and markedly reduced neuronal viability compared with neuron/E2 and neuron/E3 co-cultures. Neurons co-cultured with EKO glia showed the greatest viability with the lowest level of secreted TNF-α. Treatment of P301S neurons with recombinant ApoE (E2, E3, E4) also leads to some neuronal damage and death compared with the absence of ApoE, with ApoE4 exacerbating the effect. In individuals with a sporadic primary tauopathy, the presence of an ε4 allele is associated with more severe regional neurodegeneration. In individuals who are positive for amyloid-β pathology with symptomatic Alzheimer disease who usually have tau pathology, ε4-carriers demonstrate greater rates of disease progression. Our results demonstrate that ApoE affects tau pathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration independently of amyloid-β pathology. ApoE4 exerts a ‘toxic’ gain of function whereas the absence of ApoE is protective."

The growth of brain tumours is influenced by the microenvironment of the normal brain. Here, the authors unravel a microenvironmental signalling pathway involving secretion of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) by normal neurons. NLGN3 is cleaved by extracellular proteases, stimulates oncogenic signalling in glioma cells and induces transcriptional changes. Inhibition of NLGN3 cleavage in the tumour microenvironment impairs the growth of brain tumour xenografts in vivo, suggesting that interfering with this pathway and with microenvironmental signalling in general is a potential therapeutic strategy for brain tumours. High-grade gliomas (HGG) are a devastating group of cancers, and represent the leading cause of brain tumour-related death in both children and adults. Therapies aimed at mechanisms intrinsic to glioma cells have translated to only limited success; effective therapeutic strategies will need also to target elements of the tumour microenvironment that promote glioma progression. Neuronal activity promotes the growth of a range of molecularly and clinically distinct HGG types, including adult and paediatric glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG)1. An important mechanism that mediates this neural regulation of brain cancer is activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), which promotes glioma proliferation through the PI3K–mTOR pathway1. However, the necessity of NLGN3 for glioma growth, the proteolytic mechanism of NLGN3 secretion, and the further molecular consequences of NLGN3 secretion in glioma cells remain unknown. Here we show that HGG growth depends on microenvironmental NLGN3, identify signalling cascades downstream of NLGN3 binding in glioma, and determine a therapeutically targetable mechanism of secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of paediatric GBM, DIPG and adult GBM fail to grow in Nlgn3 knockout mice. NLGN3 stimulates several oncogenic pathways, such as early focal adhesion kinase activation upstream of PI3K–mTOR, and induces transcriptional changes that include upregulation of several synapse-related genes in glioma cells. NLGN3 is cleaved from both neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the ADAM10 sheddase. ADAM10 inhibitors prevent the release of NLGN3 into the tumour microenvironment and robustly block HGG xenograft growth. This work defines a promising strategy for targeting NLGN3 secretion, which could prove transformative for HGG therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2758268742,"Radiation pressure on dusty gas is the main physical mechanism that regulates the distribution of the circumnuclear material that obscures many supermassive black holes. Most supermassive black holes that are accreting material, and are thereby 'active', are obscured by gas and dust. However, a decrease in obscuration with increasing accretion has been observed in several previous studies, but the origin of the relationship has been unclear. Claudio Ricci and colleagues have determined that radiation pressure on the dust and gas is the explanation. This means that most of the obscuring material is located within a few to a few tens of parsecs of the black hole. They conclude that the differences between obscured and unobscured black holes are driven by the mass-normalized accretion rate of the black hole. The majority of the accreting supermassive black holes in the Universe are obscured by large columns of gas and dust1,2,3. The location and evolution of this obscuring material have been the subject of intense research in the past decades4,5, and are still debated. A decrease in the covering factor of the circumnuclear material with increasing accretion rates has been found by studies across the electromagnetic spectrum1,6,7,8. The origin of this trend may be driven by the increase in the inner radius of the obscuring material with incident luminosity, which arises from the sublimation of dust9; by the gravitational potential of the black hole10; by radiative feedback11,12,13,14; or by the interplay between outflows and inflows15. However, the lack of a large, unbiased and complete sample of accreting black holes, with reliable information on gas column density, luminosity and mass, has left the main physical mechanism that regulates obscuration unclear. Here we report a systematic multi-wavelength survey of hard-X-ray-selected black holes that reveals that radiative feedback on dusty gas is the main physical mechanism that regulates the distribution of the circumnuclear material. Our results imply that the bulk of the obscuring dust and gas is located within a few to tens of parsecs of the accreting supermassive black hole (within the sphere of influence of the black hole), and that it can be swept away even at low radiative output rates. The main physical driver of the differences between obscured and unobscured accreting black holes is therefore their mass-normalized accretion rate."

Thus, the wound microenvironment is a key determinant of Schwann cell identity, and it promotes nerve repair through integration of multiple concerted signals. The adult peripheral nervous system (PNS) retains significant regenerative potential, enabling the repair of even severe injuries such as full transection of the nerve trunk (Chen et al., 2007Chen Z.L. Yu W.M. Strickland S. Peripheral regeneration.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Following a lesion to the nerve, the portion of the axons distal to the injury site degenerates. However, unlike central nervous system axons, damaged peripheral axons are able to regrow and reinnervate their targets (Chen et al., 2007Chen Z.L. Yu W.M. Strickland S. Peripheral regeneration.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). This process is underpinned by the remarkable plasticity of the PNS glia, the Schwann cells (SCs) (Jessen et al., 2015Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Lloyd A.C. Schwann cells: development and role in nerve repair.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a020487Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2013aKim H.A. Mindos T. Parkinson D.B. Plastic fantastic: Schwann cells and repair of the peripheral nervous system.Stem Cells Transl. Med. 2013; 2: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In intact nerves, SCs are present in two differentiated states, either myelinating large-caliber axons (myelinating SCs) or ensheathing groups of small-caliber axons in Remak bundles (nonmyelinating SCs). In contrast, following injury, differentiated SCs reprogram to a progenitor-like cell. Dedifferentiated SCs switch off the myelination program and acquire an array of new phenotypes, which coordinately support nerve repair. These phenotypes include 1) secretion of neurotrophic factors to promote axonal survival, 2) clearance of myelin debris and expression of axonal guidance and adhesive cues to generate a favorable environment for axonal regrowth, 3) initiation of an inflammatory response to promote wound healing, and 4) proliferation to replace lost cells (Jessen et al., 2015Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Lloyd A.C. Schwann cells: development and role in nerve repair.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a020487Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Furthermore, upon transection injuries that generate a gap in the nerve, dedifferentiated SCs guide regrowing axons through the nerve bridge, a piece of connective tissue that forms across the gap to rejoin the severed stumps (McDonald et al., 2006McDonald D. Cheng C. Chen Y. Zochodne D. Early events of peripheral nerve regeneration.Neuron Glia Biol. 2006; 2: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). SCs from both stumps invade the bridge as multicellular cords and migrate directionally, eventually rejoining. This generates continuous cellular conduits across the wound and along which axons regrow to cross the gap and reinnervate the distal stump (Jessen et al., 2015Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Lloyd A.C.

At the molecular level, cord migration is driven by Eph/ephrin-mediated interactions between SCs and wound fibroblasts. Activation of EphB2 receptors on the SCs by ephrin-B ligands on fibroblasts induces SC sorting into cords through the relocalization of N-cadherin to cell-cell contacts in a Sox2-dependent manner (Parrinello et al., 2010Parrinello S.

Seminal work over the past few decades has uncovered key transcription factors (e.g., c-jun, sox2), epigenetic changes, and signaling pathways (e.g., ERK, Notch) that control SC reprogramming (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012Arthur-Farraj P.J.

However, a comprehensive molecular characterization of myelinating and dedifferentiated SCs in vivo is still lacking. Furthermore, despite the specialized function of bridge SCs, it remains unclear whether the reprogrammed state is homogeneous throughout the injured nerve or whether regional differences in SC state may exist, particularly within the bridge. This gap in our knowledge is largely due to the technical limitations of purifying sufficient numbers of SCs for standard downstream molecular analysis. Consistent with this, previous investigation of the transcriptional changes associated with nerve regeneration have been limited to analysis of whole nerves before and after injury (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012Arthur-Farraj P.J.

Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 2596-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, interpretation of this type of analysis is confounded by the cellular heterogeneity of nerve tissue, the pronounced inflammatory response that ensues injury, and the difference in SC content between intact and injured nerves (Cattin et al., 2015Cattin A.L. Burden J.J. Van Emmenis L. Mackenzie F.E. Hoving J.J. Garcia Calavia N. Guo Y. McLaughlin M. Rosenberg L.H.

Mirsky R. Lloyd A.C. Schwann cells: development and role in nerve repair.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a020487Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whole-tissue approaches are not amenable to the analysis of bridge SCs due to the extensive influx of stromal and inflammatory cells into the nerve bridge. Nonetheless, deciphering the SC transcriptome and its modulation by the microenvironment is a prerequisite to the understanding of PNS regeneration and, more generally, of the molecular basis of somatic cell plasticity. In this study, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based approach to prospectively purify SCs from mouse sciatic nerves. By combining this approach with RNA amplification protocols, we carried out transcriptional profiling of in vivo SCs from intact nerves and from bridge and distal stumps of transected nerves. Our analysis reveals novel phenotypes associated with SC reprogramming. Importantly, we also find that bridge SCs are a distinct subpopulation of progenitor-like SCs of increased mesenchymal character. We show that a localized increase in TGFβ signaling in the bridge underlies this change in order to promote SC invasion into the wound. Surprisingly, our studies also reveal an unprecedented crosstalk between TGFβ and EphB2, which we find is effected by transcriptional regulation of N-cadherin downstream of TGFβ. Together, our findings indicate that extracellular cues from the wound microenvironment intersect with cell-intrinsic dedifferentiation mechanisms to reprogram the SC to an invasive, mesenchymal-like cell. They further identify TGFβ as a key mediator of peripheral nerve regeneration after transection and Eph/ephrin signaling as a novel TGFβ effector, with important implications for the EMT, wound healing, and cancer. To isolate SCs from nerve tissue, we generated Schwann-cell-specific tdTomato reporter mice (hereafter tdTomSC) by crossing P0A-Cre animals, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the neural crest-specific Myelin Protein Zero (Mpz) promoter, to Rosa26tdTomato reporter strains (Giovannini et al., 2000Giovannini M. Robanus-Maandag E. van der Valk M. Niwa-Kawakita M. Abramowski V. Goutebroze L. Woodruff J.M. Berns A. Thomas G.

Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3867) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies, analysis of tdTomSC mice revealed strong tdTomato expression, unaffected by injury, in adult sciatic nerves (Figures 1A and S1A). Furthermore, coimmunostaining for the SC markers MBP and p75NGFR, which specifically label myelinating and nonmyelinating SCs, respectively, confirmed that tdTomato recombination was efficient and restricted to SCs (Giovannini et al., 2000Giovannini M. Robanus-Maandag E. van der Valk M. Niwa-Kawakita M. Abramowski V. Goutebroze L. Woodruff J.M. Berns A. Thomas G.

Thus, tdTomato is a suitable marker for purification of differentiated and dedifferentiated SCs from their in vivo microenvironment using FACS. To this end, the right sciatic nerve of tdTomSC mice was transected and, 6 days later, the contralateral intact nerve and distal stump of the severed nerve were collected together with the nerve bridge to determine potential effects of the wound microenvironment. This time point was specifically chosen because it coincides with complete SC dedifferentiation and extensive, but not complete, invasion into the bridge (Figure S2B) (Chen et al., 2007Chen Z.L. Yu W.M. Strickland S. Peripheral regeneration.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, Parrinello et al., 2010Parrinello S. Napoli I. Ribeiro S.

EphB signaling directs peripheral nerve regeneration through Sox2-dependent Schwann cell sorting.Cell. 2010; 143: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Nerve tissue was dissociated to single cells, and SCs were sorted from other tdTomato− nerve cells based on tdTomato expression (Figure 1B). Single cell preparations from P0A-Cre− nerves were used as reference for setting FACS gates. Acute immunostaining and Calcein labeling of FACS-sorted tdTomato cells confirmed that tdTomato+ cells were highly enriched for tdTomato expression, contained negligible contamination of tdTomato− cells, expressed the pan-SC marker S100β, and were viable (Figures S1C and S1D). FACS analysis of cell suspensions from all three nerve regions indicated that the vast majority of the tdTomato+ but almost none of the tdTomato− cells were S100β+, further confirming the purity of sorted tdTomato cells (Figure S1E). Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis indicated that tdTomato+ cells from intact and transected nerves were enriched for the appropriate SC differentiation (Mpz, Plp, Pmp22) and dedifferentiation (p75NGFR, Sox2, c-Jun) markers, respectively (Figure S1F). Therefore, our approach enables efficient purification of SCs from intact and severed nerve tissue. We next characterized the in vivo SC transcriptome by high-thoughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq). Libraries were prepared from four biological replicates per nerve region using a Smart-seq2 based protocol, generating an average of ∼33 × 10 reads per sample and leading to quantification of ∼15,000 genes (Picelli et al., 2014Picelli S. Faridani O.R. Björklund A.K. Winberg G. Sagasser S. Sandberg R. Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Comparable transcriptome coverage was obtained from higher-RNA-input libraries derived from in vitro material, indicating that low RNA inputs did not compromise the sensitivity of our analysis (Table S1). Moreover, reproducibility of transcript level quantification between biological repeats was high, and PCA analysis separated the samples into three clearly distinct groups, which corresponded to nerve region of origin (Figures S1G and S1H). Having confirmed the quality and reproducibility of the RNA-seq data, we first examined the transcriptional changes that accompany dedifferentiation by comparing the transcriptomes of SCs isolated from intact nerve (iSCs) and distal stump (dSCs) (Tables S2 and S3). Importantly, analysis of RNA spike-in controls was not supportive of a global relative increase in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription levels upon dedifferentiation (Figure S1I). Instead, differential expression analysis indicated that a relatively small proportion of the SC transcriptome changed significantly (1,692 genes; 1,115 with >2.5-fold change). This entailed similar numbers of up- and downregulated genes that included well-established markers for both populations, further corroborating the validity of our method (Figure 1C). Gene ontology (GO) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed several distinct biological features between differentiated and progenitor-like SCs. As expected, the transcriptome of dSCs was enriched for genes involved in cell cycle, immune recruitment, and phagocytosis, whereas GO terms associated with myelination and nerve conduction were significantly downregulated (Chen et al., 2007Chen Z.L. Yu W.M. Strickland S. Peripheral regeneration.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, Jessen et al., 2015Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Lloyd A.C. Schwann cells: development and role in nerve repair.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a020487Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D). Moreover, our analysis revealed a switch in how SCs communicate with the surrounding nerve tissue, in that iSCs showed increased levels of cell-cell communication genes (cell junction), whereas dSCs favored expression of genes mediating communication with the extracellular matrix (extracellular signal and extracellular matrix). Notably, signatures of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activated Myc were among the most highly enriched GSEA gene sets in dSCs (Figure 1E). The EMT has been linked to both somatic cell dedifferentiation to cancer stem cells and somatic cell reprogramming to induced pluripotent cells (iPS) (Ye and Weinberg, 2015Ye X. Weinberg R.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity: a central regulator of cancer progression.Trends Cell Biol. 2015; 25: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The transcription factor Myc is a crucial regulator of ES pluripotency and one of the original Yamanaka reprogramming factors (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2016Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. A decade of transcription factor-mediated reprogramming to pluripotency.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Therefore, these signatures support the notion that dedifferentiation is a reprogramming event that converts SCs to progenitor-like cells (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012Arthur-Farraj P.J. Latouche M. Wilton D.K. Quintes S. Chabrol E. Banerjee A. Woodhoo A. Jenkins B. Rahman M. Turmaine M. et al.c-Jun reprograms Schwann cells of injured nerves to generate a repair cell essential for regeneration.Neuron. 2012; 75: 633-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). To investigate this further, we analyzed expression of the three transcriptional programs that define ES cell pluripotency (Kim et al., 2010Kim J. Woo A.J. Chu J. Snow J.W. Fujiwara Y. Kim C.G. Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H.

These results suggest that, although lineage characteristics are retained after injury, dedifferentiation is not a reversal of the SC developmental program. Rather, injury reprograms SCs to a stem-like state. We next compared the transcriptomes of dSCs and bridge SCs (bSCs) (Tables S2 and S3). Interestingly, the number of differentially expressed genes between bSCs and dSCs, despite both of these being in a dedifferentiated state, was comparable to the number detected between iSCs and dSCs (2,021 genes; 1,169 with >2.5-fold change), with an overall bias toward downregulation in the bridge (Figure S2A). We generated seven gene clusters by K-means clustering of expression ratios that were further examined by GO analysis and combined with GSEA analysis of the entire dataset (Figures 2A and 2B; Table S4). Our analysis revealed a downregulation in genes essential to the repair program in bSCs, such as genes involved in inflammation, immune signaling, and ECM production, and a decrease in transcriptional activity. In contrast, genes involved in cell division, growth, and metabolism were strongly upregulated, suggesting that bridge cells might have an increased proliferative capacity. To test this more directly, we measured cell proliferation in vivo by pulsing tdTomSC mice with EdU for 4 hr from 4 to 10 days post-transection, a timeline encompassing all stages of SC migration into the bridge (Figure S2B). Consistent with the RNA-seq data, more EdU+ SCs were detected in the bridge than in distal stump at all time points (Figures 2C and 2D), indicating that bSCs are more proliferative than their distal counterparts. GSEA analysis indicated that the EMT and active Myc signatures detected upon transition from iSCs to dSCs were further enriched in bSCs, indicative of a potential change in differentiation state (Figure 2B). Indeed, closer examination of the bridge EMT signature revealed that bSCs had a more pronounced mesenchymal signature than did dSCs, with many EMT genes being more highly expressed in bSCs than in dSCs (Figure 2E). Of note, a similar decrease in Cdh1 expression, a hallmark of the EMT, was detected in both dSCs and bSCs (dSCs/iSCs: −5.13, p = 1.52e−6; bSCs/iSCs: −3.33, p = 2.5e−3). To further assess these differences and determine whether they are distinctive properties of bSCs throughout repair, we carried out time-course analysis of bSC and dSC transcriptomes by RNA-seq (Table S6). SCs were acutely FACS-sorted from the bridge and distal stumps of single transected or contralateral intact nerves. dSCs were analyzed at days 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10; nerve-matched bSCs were analyzed from day 4, the earliest time point at which invasion into the bridge occurs, up to day 10 (Figure S2B). Importantly, this analysis revealed that the differences in gene expression between bSCs and dSCs observed at day 6 are established as soon as bSCs enter the bridge and are maintained over time (Figures 2F and 2G). Similarly, genes associated with repair (k-means clusters 1 and 7) were downregulated in bSCs at all time points (Figures S2C and S2D). In contrast, the increase in EMT genes was restricted to time points at which bSCs invade into the bridge, in that this increase began at day 4, peaked at day 6, and subsided at day 8, when invasion is largely complete (Figures 2H and S2B). Importantly, this enhanced EMT signature was never detected in dSCs, indicating that it is a bridge-specific phenotype (Figure 2H). Together, these results indicate that bridge SCs are a molecularly distinct subpopulation of dedifferentiated cells with reduced repair-promoting ability and with increased proliferation and differentiation toward the mesenchymal lineage. The ECM and cellular composition of the bridge microenvironment is markedly different from the rest of the injured nerve (Cattin et al., 2015Cattin A.L. Burden J.J. Van Emmenis L. Mackenzie F.E.

https://openalex.org/W2756852269,"Diabetes and impaired brain insulin signaling are linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The association between diabetes and AD-associated amyloid pathology is stronger among carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 gene allele, the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Here we report that apoE4 impairs neuronal insulin signaling in human apoE-targeted replacement (TR) mice in an age-dependent manner. High-fat diet (HFD) accelerates these effects in apoE4-TR mice at middle age. In primary neurons, apoE4 interacts with insulin receptor and impairs its trafficking by trapping it in the endosomes, leading to impaired insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. In aging brains, the increased apoE4 aggregation and compromised endosomal function further exacerbate the inhibitory effects of apoE4 on insulin signaling and related functions. Together, our study provides novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of apoE4 and insulin resistance in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2759676893,"CYREN is a direct inhibitor of classical non-homologous end joining that promotes error-free repair by homologous recombination during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. A broken DNA molecule can be repaired in two distinct ways: homologous recombination, or classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ). Both processes function in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, but why cNHEJ is not always used is unknown. Jan Karlseder and colleagues have found that cNHEJ is suppressed in S and G2 by CYREN (cell cycle regulator of NHEJ), which binds to the Ku complex to inhibit the initial steps of end joining. The absence of CYREN results in genomic instability. CYREN thus biases repair in S and G2, when sister chromatids are available, to a recombination process that, unlike cNHEJ, is error-free. Classical non-homologous end joining1 (cNHEJ) and homologous recombination2 compete for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks during the cell cycle. Homologous recombination is inhibited during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but both pathways are active in the S and G2 phases. However, it is unclear why cNHEJ does not always outcompete homologous recombination during the S and G2 phases. Here we show that CYREN (cell cycle regulator of NHEJ) is a cell-cycle-specific inhibitor of cNHEJ. Suppression of CYREN allows cNHEJ to occur at telomeres and intrachromosomal breaks during the S and G2 phases, and cells lacking CYREN accumulate chromosomal aberrations upon damage induction, specifically outside the G1 phase. CYREN acts by binding to the Ku70/80 heterodimer and preferentially inhibits cNHEJ at breaks with overhangs by protecting them. We therefore propose that CYREN is a direct cell-cycle-dependent inhibitor of cNHEJ that promotes error-free repair by homologous recombination during cell cycle phases when sister chromatids are present."
https://openalex.org/W2754109996,"In mammals, the canonical somatic DNA methylation landscape is established upon specification of the embryo proper and subsequently disrupted within many cancer types. However, the underlying mechanisms that direct this genome-scale transformation remain elusive, with no clear model for its systematic acquisition or potential developmental utility. Here, we analysed global remethylation from the mouse preimplantation embryo into the early epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm. We show that these two states acquire highly divergent genomic distributions with substantial disruption of bimodal, CpG density-dependent methylation in the placental progenitor. The extraembryonic epigenome includes specific de novo methylation at hundreds of embryonically protected CpG island promoters, particularly those that are associated with key developmental regulators and are orthologously methylated across most human cancer types. Our data suggest that the evolutionary innovation of extraembryonic tissues may have required co-option of DNA methylation-based suppression as an alternative to regulation by Polycomb-group proteins, which coordinate embryonic germ-layer formation in response to extraembryonic cues. Moreover, we establish that this decision is made deterministically, downstream of promiscuously used-and frequently oncogenic-signalling pathways, via a novel combination of epigenetic cofactors. Methylation of developmental gene promoters during tumorigenesis may therefore reflect the misappropriation of an innate trajectory and the spontaneous reacquisition of a latent, developmentally encoded epigenetic landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2756611662,"The measurement of magnesium isotope ratios at improved accuracy suggests that planetary compositions result from fractionation between liquid and vapour, followed by vapour escape during accretionary growth. In comparison to primitive, chondritic meteorites, which are widely thought to be the building blocks of Earth, Earth and other differentiated planetary bodies are chemically fractionated, with Earth's crust and mantle—the 'silicate Earth'—being strongly depleted in moderately volatile elements (such as lead, zinc, indium and the alkali metals). Two papers in this week's issue suggest that this difference in composition between chondritic meteorites and Earth could be a natural consequence of vapour loss from magma on the surface of growing planetesimals. Ashley Norris and Bernard Wood examined the melting processes that would have occurred during accretion on Earth and its precursor bodies and performed vaporization experiments under conditions of fixed temperature and oxygen partial pressure. They found that the pattern of volatile-element depletion in the silicate Earth is consistent with partial melting and vaporization rather than with simple accretion of a volatile-rich chondrite-like body. Remco Hin and co-authors show that differentiated planetary bodies have isotopically heavier magnesium compositions compared to chondritic meteorites, and conclude that this could be due to the isotopic fractionation between liquid and vapour, followed by vapour escape during accretionary growth of planetesimals. It has long been recognized that Earth and other differentiated planetary bodies are chemically fractionated compared to primitive, chondritic meteorites and, by inference, the primordial disk from which they formed. However, it is not known whether the notable volatile depletions of planetary bodies are a consequence of accretion1 or inherited from prior nebular fractionation2. The isotopic compositions of the main constituents of planetary bodies can contribute to this debate3,4,5,6. Here we develop an analytical approach that corrects a major cause of measurement inaccuracy inherent in conventional methods, and show that all differentiated bodies have isotopically heavier magnesium compositions than chondritic meteorites. We argue that possible magnesium isotope fractionation during condensation of the solar nebula, core formation and silicate differentiation cannot explain these observations. However, isotopic fractionation between liquid and vapour, followed by vapour escape during accretionary growth of planetesimals, generates appropriate residual compositions. Our modelling implies that the isotopic compositions of magnesium, silicon and iron, and the relative abundances of the major elements of Earth and other planetary bodies, are a natural consequence of substantial (about 40 per cent by mass) vapour loss from growing planetesimals by this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2757618046,"The trigeminal ganglion contains somatosensory neurons that detect a range of thermal, mechanical and chemical cues and innervate unique sensory compartments in the head and neck including the eyes, nose, mouth, meninges and vibrissae. We used single-cell sequencing and in situ hybridization to examine the cellular diversity of the trigeminal ganglion in mice, defining thirteen clusters of neurons. We show that clusters are well conserved in dorsal root ganglia suggesting they represent distinct functional classes of somatosensory neurons and not specialization associated with their sensory targets. Notably, functionally important genes (e.g. the mechanosensory channel Piezo2 and the capsaicin gated ion channel Trpv1) segregate into multiple clusters and often are expressed in subsets of cells within a cluster. Therefore, the 13 genetically-defined classes are likely to be physiologically heterogeneous rather than highly parallel (i.e., redundant) lines of sensory input. Our analysis harnesses the power of single-cell sequencing to provide a unique platform for in silico expression profiling that complements other approaches linking gene-expression with function and exposes unexpected diversity in the somatosensory system."
https://openalex.org/W2760009843,"Hippocampal replays have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in memory. Chains of ripples (ripple bursts) in CA1 have been reported to co-occur with long-range place cell sequence replays during the quiet awake state, but roles of neural inputs to CA1 in ripple bursts and replays are unknown. Here we show that ripple bursts in CA1 and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are temporally associated. An inhibition of MECIII input to CA1 during quiet awake reduced ripple bursts in CA1 and restricted the spatial coverage of replays to a shorter distance corresponding to single ripple events. The reduction did not occur with MECIII input inhibition during slow-wave sleep. Inhibition of CA3 activity suppressed ripples and replays in CA1 regardless of behavioral state. Thus, MECIII input to CA1 is crucial for ripple bursts and long-range replays specifically in quiet awake, whereas CA3 input is essential for both, regardless of behavioral state."

The silicate Earth is strongly depleted in moderately volatile elements (such as lead, zinc, indium and alkali elements) relative to CI chondrites, the meteorites that compositionally most closely resemble the Sun1. This depletion may be explained qualitatively by accretion of 10 to 20 per cent of a volatile-rich body to a reduced volatile-free proto-Earth2,3, followed by partial extraction of some elements to the core1. However, there are several unanswered questions regarding the sources of Earth’s volatiles4,5, notably the overabundance of indium in the silicate Earth.

Here, we uncover a new mechanism for realising a much larger energy scale of inversion symmetry breaking at surfaces and interfaces than is typically achieved. The key ingredient is a pronounced asymmetry of surface hopping energies, i.e. a kinetic energy-driven inversion symmetry breaking, whose energy scale is pinned at a significant fraction of the bandwidth. We show, from spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, how this enables surface states of 3d and 4d-based transition-metal oxides to surprisingly develop some of the largest Rashba-like spin splittings that are known. Our findings open new possibilities to produce spin textured states in oxides which exploit the full potential of the bare atomic spin-orbit coupling, raising exciting prospects for oxide spintronics. More generally, the core structural building blocks which enable this are common to numerous materials, providing the prospect of enhanced inversion symmetry breaking at judiciously-chosen surfaces of a plethora of compounds, and suggesting routes to interfacial control of inversion symmetry breaking in designer heterostructures."
https://openalex.org/W2757870059,"Theories like predictive coding propose that lower-order brain areas compare their inputs to predictions derived from higher-order representations and signal their deviation as a prediction error. Here, we investigate whether the macaque face-processing system, a three-level hierarchy in the ventral stream, employs such a coding strategy. We show that after statistical learning of specific face sequences, the lower-level face area ML computes the deviation of actual from predicted stimuli. But these signals do not reflect the tuning characteristic of ML. Rather, they exhibit identity specificity and view invariance, the tuning properties of higher-level face areas AL and AM. Thus, learning appears to endow lower-level areas with the capability to test predictions at a higher level of abstraction than what is afforded by the feedforward sweep. These results provide evidence for computational architectures like predictive coding and suggest a new quality of functional organization of information-processing hierarchies beyond pure feedforward schemes."
https://openalex.org/W2758568627,"Individuals suffering from substance-use disorders develop strong associations between the drug's rewarding effects and environmental cues, creating powerful, enduring triggers for relapse. We found that dephosphorylated, nuclear histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) reduced cocaine reward-context associations and relapse-like behaviors in a cocaine self-administration model. We also discovered that HDAC5 associates with an activity-sensitive enhancer of the Npas4 gene and negatively regulates NPAS4 expression. Exposure to cocaine and the test chamber induced rapid and transient NPAS4 expression in a small subpopulation of FOS-positive neurons in the NAc. Conditional deletion of Npas4 in the NAc significantly reduced cocaine conditioned place preference and delayed learning of the drug-reinforced action during cocaine self-administration, without affecting cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. These data suggest that HDAC5 and NPAS4 in the NAc are critically involved in reward-relevant learning and memory processes and that nuclear HDAC5 limits reinstatement of drug seeking independent of NPAS4."
https://openalex.org/W2758121911,"The abundant synaptic protein CaMKII is necessary for long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. However, whether CaMKII is required only during initial processes or whether it also mediates memory storage remains unclear. The most direct test of a storage role is the erasure test. In this test, a putative memory molecule is inhibited after learning. The key prediction is that this should produce persistent memory erasure even after the inhibitory agent is removed. We conducted this test using transient viral (HSV) expression of dominant-negative CaMKII-alpha (K42M) in the hippocampus. This produced persistent erasure of conditioned place avoidance. As an additional test, we found that expression of activated CaMKII (T286D/T305A/T306A) impaired place avoidance, a result not expected if a process other than CaMKII stores memory. Our behavioral results, taken together with prior experiments on LTP, strongly support a critical role of CaMKII in LTP maintenance and memory storage."

Recently, ATII-responsive neurons in the subfornical organ (SFO) and aldosterone-sensitive neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTSHSD2 neurons) were shown to drive sodium appetite. Here we investigate the basis for NTSHSD2 neuron activation, identify the circuit by which NTSHSD2 neurons drive appetite, and uncover an interaction between the NTSHSD2 circuit and ATII signaling. NTSHSD2 neurons respond to sodium deficiency with spontaneous pacemaker-like activity—the consequence of “cardiac” HCN and Nav1.5 channels. Remarkably, NTSHSD2 neurons are necessary for sodium appetite, and with concurrent ATII signaling their activity is sufficient to produce rapid consumption. Importantly, NTSHSD2 neurons stimulate appetite via projections to the vlBNST, which is also the effector site for ATII-responsive SFO neurons. The interaction between angiotensin signaling and NTSHSD2 neurons provides a neuronal context for the long-standing “synergy hypothesis” of sodium appetite regulation."

Knowledge of the GRAS gene family in maize remains was largely unknown, and their characterization is necessary to understand their importance in the maize life cycle. This study identified 86 GRAS genes in maize, and further characterized with phylogenetics, gene structural analysis, genomic loci, and expression patterns. The 86 GRAS genes were divided into 8 groups (SCL3, HAM, LS, SCR, DELLA, SHR, PAT1 and LISCL) by phylogenetic analysis. Most of the maize GRAS genes contain one exon (80.23%) and closely related members in the phylogenetic tree had similar structure and motif composition. Different motifs especially in the N-terminus might be the sources of their functional divergence. Segmental- and tandem-duplication occurred in this family leading to expansion of maize GRAS genes and the expression patterns of the duplicated genes in the heat map according to the published microarray data were very similar. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) results demonstrated that the expression level of genes in different tissues were different, suggesting their differential roles in plant growth and development.

To address this question, we trained rats on appetitive and aversive conditioning in different contexts. Distinct groups of BL neurons displayed increased activity during appetitive (CS-R) versus aversive (CS-S) conditioned stimuli (R cells and S cells, respectively), and they were typically inhibited by the other CS. When the CS-S was presented in the safe context, rats entered a long-lasting, anxiety-like state characterized by increased inter-CS freezing and impaired reward seeking. During this state, a subset of BL cells (“state cells”) showed sustained shifts in baseline activity whose time course matched that of the behavioral changes. Many state cells with increased firing rates were S cells, whereas R cells only included state cells with reduced firing rates. Thus, anxiety involves persistent activity changes that are differentially expressed by subsets of valence-specific BL neurons.

Fear and anxiety are defensive responses with distinct triggers and durations (Davis et al., 2010Davis M. Walker D.L. Miles L. Grillon C.

Fear arises in situations where organisms are confronted with imminent threats, resulting in brief defensive behaviors, like immobility, escape, or attack, depending on threat proximity. In contrast, anxiety is a longer-lasting state of increased vigilance and apprehension that develops in the anticipation of uncertain or unpredictable perils. While functional imaging studies have implicated the human amygdala in fear and anxiety (Ipser et al., 2013Ipser J.C. Singh L. Stein D.J.

These studies, as well as related investigations on appetitive conditioning, have revealed that the acquisition of conditioned emotional responses involves activity-dependent plasticity in the lateral amygdala (LA) (Duvarci and Pare, 2014Duvarci S. Pare D. Amygdala microcircuits controlling learned fear.Neuron. 2014; 82: 966-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). As a result, some LA neurons develop potentiated responses to conditioned stimuli (CSs) that predict aversive or rewarding outcomes (Maren and Quirk, 2004Maren S. Quirk G.J.

However, the incidence of (and overlap between) neurons with excitatory or inhibitory responses to appetitive and aversive CSs is still unclear, as prior studies yielded inconsistent results. Furthermore, the amygdala, and especially BL, has been implicated in the genesis of anxiety (Davis and Walker, 2014Davis M. Walker D.L.

Amygdala circuitry mediating reversible and bidirectional control of anxiety.Nature. 2011; 471: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). For example, presentation of multiple unpredictable footshocks causes a persistent enhancement of baseline startle, and this anxiety-like state is blocked by inactivating BL (Davis and Walker, 2014Davis M. Walker D.L. Role of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and amygdala AMPA receptors in the development and expression of context conditioning and sensitization of startle by prior shock.Brain Struct. Funct. 2014; 219: 1969-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Also, optogenetic excitation of BL projections to the ventral hippocampus induces an anxiety-like state (Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013Felix-Ortiz A.C. Beyeler A. Seo C. Leppla C.A. Wildes C.P. Tye K.M. BLA to vHPC inputs modulate anxiety-related behaviors.Neuron. 2013; 79: 658-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, the pattern of BL activity associated with anxiety remains to be characterized. It is still unclear whether the expression of anxiety involves the sustained activation of cells with excitatory responses to aversive CSs or the recruitment of a different group of dedicated neurons. Also unknown is how anxiety affects the subset of BL neurons that supports appetitive CRs (Paton et al., 2006Paton J.J. Belova M.A. Morrison S.E. Salzman C.D. The primate amygdala represents the positive and negative value of visual stimuli during learning.Nature. 2006; 439: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, Stuber et al., 2011Stuber G.D. Sparta D.R. Stamatakis A.M. van Leeuwen W.A. Hardjoprajitno J.E. Cho S. Tye K.M. Kempadoo K.A. Zhang F. Deisseroth K. Bonci A. Excitatory transmission from the amygdala to nucleus accumbens facilitates reward seeking.Nature. 2011; 475: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The present study addressed these questions. To elicit anxiety-like states, we subjected rats to a mixed appetitive/aversive conditioning paradigm, where rats first learned in one environment (A) that distinct auditory stimuli predicted neutral (CS-N) or rewarding (CS-R) outcomes. Then, in a second context (B), rats learned that a third cue (CS-S) predicted the delivery of footshocks. Next, in context A (the “safe” context), rats were first presented with a mixture of CS-Rs and CS-Ns followed by a series of CS-Ss. Presentations of the threatening CS in the safe context produced an anxiety-like state that continued long after the last CS-S (Figures 1A–1D). This behavioral state was characterized by persistently increased freezing levels in the absence of immediate threat (Figures 1B and 1C, “inter-CS freezing”) and impaired reward-seeking behavior in response to later CS-Rs (Figures 1A and 1D). Below, we first characterize the various types of responses elicited in BL neurons by the different CSs and then examine how these transient responses map onto the sustained activity patterns present during anxiety. Based on spike width and mean firing rate (FR; Figures S1 and S2), recorded cells (n = 371) were classified as putative principal neurons (PNs; n = 343; Figures 1E–1I and 2; Figure S3) or fast-spiking interneurons (ITNs; n = 28; Figure S4). After conditioning, a minority of PNs showed significant increases in FRs during the CS-R (“R cells”; 7.0%; Figures 1E and 1G) or CS-S (“S cells”; 10.5%; Figures 1F and 1H; rank-sum tests, p < 0.005; Figure S3). In contrast, the incidence of PNs with reduced FRs during these two CSs was much higher (51.0% and 27.4% of cells with the CS-R and CS-S, respectively; Figures 1G and 1H). Figure S5 shows where CS-responsive PNs are located. To examine whether individual PNs respond to CSs of opposite valence in similar or different ways, we plotted their responses to the CS-R against those to the CS-S. This analysis revealed that while there was little overlap between PNs excited by the CS-R or CS-S (four cells), cells inhibited by both were common (Figures 2A and 2B ). Furthermore, R and S cells often displayed inhibitory responses to the other CS (Figure 2C), suggesting that there is an antagonistic relationship between them. Among PNs inhibited during the CS-R (n = 175) or the CS-S (n = 94), respectively, 31% and 58% reduced their FRs during the other CS (Figure 2C). Consistent with the neutral outcome of the CS-N, the incidence of PNs with altered FRs during this CS was lower than with the other two CSs (chi-square = 242.7, p < 0.0001; increase, 3.8%; decrease, 15.7%; Figure 1I), and these firing changes had a lower amplitude than with the other CSs (Figure S3). Last, irrespective of CS identity, unresponsive and inhibited cells were more common among PNs with low FRs and conversely for CS-excited cells (Figures 1G–1I). Overall, these results indicate that CS-excited cells are comprised of two largely independent subsets of PNs with opposite response profiles. In contrast, PNs inhibited by the different CSs overlap extensively. Relative to PNs, a higher proportion of presumed ITNs showed significant increases in FRs (rank-sum tests, p < 0.005) during the various CSs (Figure S4): 57% of ITNs were activated during at least one CS, compared to 17.2% of PNs (chi-square = 25.6, p < 0.0001). However, the incidence of inhibitory responses did not differ (chi-square = 1.47, p = 0.23; respectively, 53.6% and 65.0% of ITNs and PNs were inhibited during at least one CS). As a result, a similar proportion of ITNs showed reductions versus increases in FRs during the various CSs (Figures S4F–S4H), with 25% exhibiting responses of opposite polarities during the CS-R and CS-S (Figure S4K). Finally, dissimilar to PNs, there was no relationship between baseline FRs and CS response types among ITNs (Figures S4F–S4H). Upon presentation of the first CS-S in the safe context (A), a subset of PNs (11.4%) and ITNs (18%), hereafter termed “state cells,” showed persistent increases or decreases in “baseline FRs,” as assessed in between the CSs (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, p < 0.05; Figure 3). These cells were distributed among the various types of CS-responsive neurons described above. Figure S6 shows their location. Examples of state PNs can be seen in Figure 3 (S cells, Figures 3A and 3B; R cells, Figures 3C and 3D, and PNs with reduced activity during the CS-R and CS-S [termed RiSi], Figures 3E and 3F). Additional state cells are illustrated in Figure S7. As apparent in these representative examples, the change in baseline activity typically began right after the first CS-S and persisted long after the last CS-S, paralleling the persistent increase in freezing levels (Figure 1C) and decrease in reward seeking (Figures 1D and 3A–3F) associated with anxiety. Of note, none of the PNs excited by both the CS-R and the CS-S were state cells. The incidence of anxiety-related neurons varied significantly between the different classes of PNs that we delineated based on their activity during valenced CSs (Figure 3G; chi-square = 17.45, p = 0.004). In particular, state cells consisted of ∼30% of S cells compared to ∼9% of the other cell classes combined. Moreover, the incidence of PNs with increased, decreased, or unchanged activity during anxiety differed significantly between S cells and R cells (chi-square = 8.46, p = 0.015), and there was a strong correspondence between the polarity of the cells’ responses to the different CSs and the polarity of the changes in baseline FRs they displayed during anxiety. Indeed, S cells were ten times more likely to exhibit increased than decreased baseline FRs during anxiety (Figure 3G). In contrast, all state cells found among R cells showed a decrease in baseline activity during anxiety (Figure 3G). Consistent with these findings, separately averaging the baseline activity of all PNs (not only the state cells) within the various subclasses delineated in Figure 3G revealed that S cells and R cells underwent sustained alterations in activity during anxiety (Figure 3H). On average, S cells displayed an ∼5-fold increase in baseline FR (Figure 3H, red; signed-rank test, p < 0.001). Conversely, R cells displayed an ∼60% reduction in baseline activity (Figure 3H, blue; signed-rank test, p = 0.03). No change in baseline activity was detected in the other classes of PNs. Overall, these results suggest that anxiety recruits two types of state cells, with decreased or increased baseline FRs, and that they are differentially represented among R and S cells. So far, state cells were classified using changes in baseline FRs without considering the temporal structure of their activity. Thus, we next tested whether the ensemble activity of state cells correlated with moment-to-moment variations in freezing behavior using a decoder analysis on recording sessions where multiple state cells were simultaneously recorded. Six of 14 recording sessions from five rats met this criterion (recall sessions, n = 2; extinction training sessions, n = 4). During these sessions, we simultaneously recorded an average of 7.2 ± 1.7 state cells (range 2 to 13). Examples are shown in Figures 4A and 4B . In all six tested sessions, there was a significant correlation between predicted and observed values (range of r: 0.35 to 0.85; average 0.56 ± 0.08). Figures 4C–4E illustrate three such examples with significant (p < 0.05) freezing correlations of 0.85, 0.73, and 0.7, respectively. To examine whether state cells only encode freezing, we calculated the proportion of FR variance explained by freezing versus state using an ANOVA. State accounted for a higher proportion of FR variance than freezing (Figure S8A). Comparing the FR of state cells during periods devoid of freezing within versus outside the anxiety phase also showed significant FR changes (Figure S8B), again indicating that state cells encode state even when the contribution of freezing is excluded. In fact, we found that not only state cells, but also cells that responded to the CS-S with increased or decreased firing rates do not only encode freezing as they showed a variable relation to this index of fear (Figure S9). The presence of state cells with increased or decreased FRs among PNs and ITNs raised the possibility that connectivity between specific subsets of state cells contributes to shaping the activity patterns seen during the anxiety-like state. To test this possibility, we carried out cross-correlation analyses between all pairs of simultaneously recorded PNs and ITNs (Tables S1–S4). Although these analyses revealed that connections between specific subtypes of PNs and ITNs contribute to shaping their CS responsiveness (Tables S3 and S4), we found no evidence that monosynaptic connections between relevant groups of state PNs and ITNs contribute to generate the activity patterns seen in BL during anxiety (Tables S1 and S2). Functional imaging and lesion studies in humans suggest that the basolateral amygdala is involved in the genesis of anxiety. For instance, amygdala activation correlates positively with symptom severity in post-traumatic stress disorder (Rauch et al., 2000Rauch S.L. Whalen P.J. Shin L.M. McInerney S.C. Macklin M.L. Lasko N.B. Orr S.P. Pitman R.K. Exaggerated amygdala response to masked facial stimuli in posttraumatic stress disorder: a functional MRI study.Biol. Psychiatry. 2000; 47: 769-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Moreover, the incidence of this disorder is much lower in war veterans who suffered localized damage to the amygdala than to other brain regions (Koenigs et al., 2008Koenigs M. Huey E.D. Raymont V. Cheon B. Solomon J. Wassermann E.M. Grafman J. Focal brain damage protects against post-traumatic stress disorder in combat veterans.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the neuronal activity patterns that are expressed during anxiety are unknown. The present study aimed to shed light on this question. We found that anxiety is associated with the differential recruitment of competing valence-related BL neurons. The significance of these findings is considered below. Previously, it was reported that BL modulates anxiety-related behaviors (Davis and Walker, 2014Davis M. Walker D.L.

In mixed appetitive-aversive conditioning paradigms, a variety of CS response types were observed, including cells selectively excited or inhibited by positively or negatively valenced CSs as well as neurons exhibiting responses of the same or opposite polarities to these CSs (Beyeler et al., 2016Beyeler A.

Substantial similarity in amygdala neuronal activity during conditioned appetitive and aversive emotional arousal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 15031-15036Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the incidence of, and overlap between, these various types of neurons in BL remained unclear. Indeed, prior studies yielded inconsistent results, possibly because they used different species and combined data obtained in different nuclei of the amygdala and cell types. Moreover, it remained unknown whether these various subgroups of valence-related BL cells are differentially recruited during anxiety. In BL, we found that only ∼27% of PNs remained unresponsive to the CS-R and CS-S after conditioning. Nearly 60% of PNs developed inhibitory responses to one or both of these CSs. A minority (∼16%) displayed higher FRs during the CS-R or CS-S, with cells excited by both being very rare (∼1%). Instead, PNs excited by the CS-R or CS-S exhibited inhibitory responses during the other CS or were unresponsive to the other CS. While a higher proportion of presumed ITNs increased their FRs during at least one valenced CS (54%), they too displayed a significant degree of separation as only 11% of interneurons were excited by both CSs. Together, our results indicate that in BL, largely non-overlapping subsets of PNs and ITNs are excited by positively or negatively valenced CSs. These results raise the question of what factors determine the identity of the PNs recruited in aversive and appetitive memories. A first possibility is connectivity. BL contains multiple subgroups of PNs that project to diverse sites (Pitkanen, 2000Pitkanen A. Connectivity of the rat amygdaloid complex.in: Aggleton J.P. The Amygdala: A Functional Analysis. Oxford University Press, 2000: 31-116Google Scholar), and recent studies have shown that specific BL projections are associated with different behaviors (Ambroggi et al., 2008Ambroggi F. Ishikawa A.

The valence-specific subsets of BL neurons observed here may correspond to the distinct BL output circuits evidenced in these prior studies. However, another possible explanation stems from the observation that recruitment of neurons into memory traces is influenced by dynamic factors, like intrinsic neuronal excitability at the time of training, such that different subsets of neurons are recruited at different times (Han et al., 2007Han J.-H. Kushner S.A. Yiu A.P. Cole C.J. Matynia A. Brown R.A. Neve R.L. Guzowski J.F. Silva A.J. Josselyn S.A.

Kushner S.A. et al.Neurons are recruited to a memory trace based on relative neuronal excitability immediately before training.Neuron. 2014; 83: 722-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Together, these two lines of evidence suggest that BL neurons are flexibly recruited to emotional memories depending on their intrinsic excitability and related molecular expression but that they are selected among pools of neurons that are pre-wired to generate specific behaviors (Ziv et al., 2013Ziv Y. Burns L.D. Cocker E.D. Hamel E.O. Ghosh K.K. Kitch L.J. El Gamal A. Schnitzer M.J. Long-term dynamics of CA1 hippocampal place codes.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 264-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In this conceptual framework, valence would still be an important factor for the separation of R and S cells. Consistent with this possibility, we previously found that the activity of R cells correlated more strongly with reward-seeking behavior than the CS-R itself (Lee et al., 2016Lee S.-C. Amir A. Headley D.B. Haufler D. Pare D. Basolateral amygdala nucleus responses to appetitive conditioned stimuli correlate with variations in conditioned behaviour.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Since reward seeking is not an expected conditioned response to a CS-S, this predicts that the majority of R cells should not overlap with S cells regardless of time or the specific sensory features of the CSs and unconditioned stimuli (USs). Further support for the notion that BL contains distinct valence-specific networks comes from activity-based cell labeling or Ca2+-imaging studies with USs (Gore et al., 2015Gore F. Schwartz E.C.

https://openalex.org/W2758402754,"Migraine is a recurrent pain condition traditionally viewed as a neurovascular disorder, but little is known of its vascular basis. In epidemiological studies migraine is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD), suggesting shared pathogenic mechanisms. This study aimed to determine the genetic overlap between migraine and CAD, and to identify shared genetic risk loci, utilizing a conditional false discovery rate approach and data from two large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of CAD (C4D, 15,420 cases, 15,062 controls; CARDIoGRAM, 22,233 cases, 64,762 controls) and one of migraine (22,120 cases, 91,284 controls). We found significant enrichment of genetic variants associated with CAD as a function of their association with migraine, which was replicated across two independent CAD GWAS studies. One shared risk locus in the PHACTR1 gene (conjunctional false discovery rate for index SNP rs9349379 < 3.90 x 10−5), which was also identified in previous studies, explained much of the enrichment. Two further loci (in KCNK5 and AS3MT) showed evidence for shared risk (conjunctional false discovery rate < 0.05). The index SNPs at two of the three loci had opposite effect directions in migraine and CAD. Our results confirm previous reports that migraine and CAD share genetic risk loci in excess of what would be expected by chance, and highlight one shared risk locus in PHACTR1. Understanding the biological mechanisms underpinning this shared risk is likely to improve our understanding of both disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2757082318,"Since electronic cigarette (ECIG) introduction to American markets in 2007, vaping has surged in popularity. Many, including women of reproductive age, also believe that ECIG use is safer than traditional tobacco cigarettes and is not hazardous when pregnant. However, there are few studies investigating the effects of ECIG exposure on the developing embryo and nothing is known about potential effects on craniofacial development. Therefore, we have tested the effects of several aerosolized e-cigarette liquids (e-cigAM) in an in vivo craniofacial model, Xenopus laevis, as well as a mammalian neural crest cell line. Results demonstrate that e-cigAM exposure during embryonic development induces a variety of defects, including median facial clefts and midface hypoplasia in two of e-cigAMs tested e-cigAMs. Detailed quantitative analyses of the facial morphology revealed that nicotine is not the main factor in inducing craniofacial defects, but can exacerbate the effects of the other e-liquid components. Additionally, while two different e-cigAMs can have very similar consequences on facial appearances, there are subtle differences that could be due to the differences in e-cigAM components. Further assessment of embryos exposed to these particular e-cigAMs revealed cranial cartilage and muscle defects and a reduction in the blood supply to the face. Finally, the expression of markers for vascular and cartilage differentiation was reduced in a mammalian neural crest cell line corroborating the in vivo effects. Our work is the first to show that ECIG use could pose a potential hazard to the developing embryo and cause craniofacial birth defects. This emphasizes the need for more testing and regulation of this new popular product."
https://openalex.org/W2757787969,"•A theory of synaptic plasticity that predicts pre- and postsynaptic expression loci•The framework captures LTP and LTD data across different experiments and brain regions•Variability of pre/post changes due to optimizing postsynaptic response statistics•Optimization at inhibitory synapses suggests a statistically optimal E/I balance Long-term modifications of neuronal connections are critical for reliable memory storage in the brain. However, their locus of expression—pre- or postsynaptic—is highly variable. Here we introduce a theoretical framework in which long-term plasticity performs an optimization of the postsynaptic response statistics toward a given mean with minimal variance. Consequently, the state of the synapse at the time of plasticity induction determines the ratio of pre- and postsynaptic modifications. Our theory explains the experimentally observed expression loci of the hippocampal and neocortical synaptic potentiation studies we examined. Moreover, the theory predicts presynaptic expression of long-term depression, consistent with experimental observations. At inhibitory synapses, the theory suggests a statistically efficient excitatory-inhibitory balance in which changes in inhibitory postsynaptic response statistics specifically target the mean excitation. Our results provide a unifying theory for understanding the expression mechanisms and functions of long-term synaptic transmission plasticity. Long-term modifications of neuronal connections are critical for reliable memory storage in the brain. However, their locus of expression—pre- or postsynaptic—is highly variable. Here we introduce a theoretical framework in which long-term plasticity performs an optimization of the postsynaptic response statistics toward a given mean with minimal variance. Consequently, the state of the synapse at the time of plasticity induction determines the ratio of pre- and postsynaptic modifications. Our theory explains the experimentally observed expression loci of the hippocampal and neocortical synaptic potentiation studies we examined. Moreover, the theory predicts presynaptic expression of long-term depression, consistent with experimental observations. At inhibitory synapses, the theory suggests a statistically efficient excitatory-inhibitory balance in which changes in inhibitory postsynaptic response statistics specifically target the mean excitation. Our results provide a unifying theory for understanding the expression mechanisms and functions of long-term synaptic transmission plasticity. Our brain must retain accurate memories of past events. Reliable memory storage is believed to depend on long-term modifications in synaptic transmission (Gruart et al., 2006Gruart A. Muñoz M.D. Delgado-García J.M.

In synapses, the combined effect of presynaptic release and subsequent postsynaptic detection of neurotransmitters on the postsynaptic membrane potential has been formalized as a (Binomial) stochastic process whose mean and variance depend on Prel, N and q, such that mean=NqPrel and variance=Nq2Prel(1−Prel). Here, Prel is the probability of presynaptic release at N release sites, each affecting the delivery of a quantized charge q into the postsynaptic cell (Figure 1A) (Del Castillo and Katz, 1954Del Castillo J.

To our best knowledge, no theory has been proposed to explain the long standing riddle of high variability in the expression loci of long-term synaptic plasticity. Here we propose that experimentally observed combinations of pre- and postsynaptic changes are a consequence of an optimization of the postsynaptic response statistics. In this framework of statistical long-term synaptic plasticity (statLTSP), the initial state of the synapse determines the appropriate changes toward an upper or lower statistical bound, i.e., toward a response with minimal variance and a given mean. This view of minimal variance of the postsynaptic responses is consistent with experimental observations of highly reliable synapses and responses in vitro and in vivo (Silver et al., 2003Silver R.A.

Gutnisky D.A. Yu J. O’Connor D.H. Svoboda K. Low-noise encoding of active touch by layer 4 in the somatosensory cortex.eLife. 2015; 4: e06619PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, by assuming a statistical bound with a given mean and zero variance, we derived a relatively simple theoretical framework with only one free parameter (i.e., the mean of the postsynaptic response). Our theory correctly identifies the expression loci of individual experiments of long-term potentiation in hippocampal and neocortical excitatory synapses. At excitatory synapses, we interpret the bound as physiological constraints on pre- and postsynaptic terminals, such as finite vesicle release probability (i.e., on Prel) and receptor density (i.e., on q), respectively. Our framework also predicts the state dependence of LTP and presynaptic expression of long-term depression, consistent with experimental observations in the cortex. Moreover, our results implicate known retrograde messengers (nitric oxide and endocannabinoids) in communicating the divergence to the bound predicted by statLTSP. When applied to plasticity at inhibitory synapses, it proposes an optimization of the postsynaptic response statistics toward a specific bound (i.e., the mean excitatory response), which creates a statistically efficient excitation-inhibition balance. In summary, our results suggest a general principle in which long-term synaptic plasticity optimizes the mean and variance of postsynaptic responses by inducing the appropriate amount of pre- and postsynaptic change. The origins of variability in expression loci of long-term synaptic plasticity have remained unclear. We introduce a theoretical framework in which such variability is explained as a consequence of a gradual optimization of the postsynaptic responses’ distribution toward a higher or lower bound, i.e., the most reliable, strongest possible synapse in the case of potentiation, or the most reliable, weakest synapse in the case of depression (Figure 1C and Movie S1). Modifying pre- and postsynaptic components has a differential impact on the postsynaptic response statistics. For example, changing q may increase mean and increase variance of the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials, whereas changing Prel may increase the mean but decrease the variability of the postsynaptic response (Figure 1C). The effect of these changes depends on the initial state of the synapse, and how far it is from the optimal solution. In our framework, for every pair of initial states Prel and q, there is an ideal combination of pre- and postsynaptic changes that will minimize the difference between the response statistics and the bound (i.e., the KL-divergence), creating a flow field of gradual changes (Figure 1D). In other words, statistical long-term synaptic plasticity (statLTSP) determines how pre- and postsynaptic changes should be coordinated to best close the gap between the current state and its optimum. In order to compare our theoretical framework with experimental data, we first calculated pre- and postsynaptic contributions to the postsynaptic response distribution before and after plasticity induction (or used published ones when available). For experiments at excitatory synapses, we then fitted the bound to best capture the changes in pre- and postsynaptic parameters, and we compared observed with predicted pre/postsynaptic changes. To validate these results, we used testing datasets (i.e., where the bound was not fitted) and compared with alternative models. At inhibitory synapses we estimated pre- and postsynaptic changes before and after induction and compared the trajectories of the model in which we used the mean excitatory input as the bound. To test our statistical theory we compared various datasets of pre- and postsynaptic changes with the predicted flow field. For each long-term potentiation dataset, we obtained Prel, q and estimated the bound φ of synaptic efficacy from the data (in units of the postsynaptic response). To this end, we used the same mean weights for model and experiment before, and after induction, and use statLTSP to predict the exact post/pre ratio of the response (see STAR Methods). Additionally, to exclude the possibility of overfitting, we analyzed the difference between the predicted flow field and observed changes in separate datasets not used for fitting φ. For hippocampal synapses recorded in slices before and after long-term potentiation (Larkman et al., 1992Larkman A. Hannay T. Stratford K. Jack J. Presynaptic release probability influences the locus of long-term potentiation.Nature. 1992; 360: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), our theory accurately predicted the ratio of change of Prel and q in both the fitted dataset (rq = 0.83; p < 0.001; rPrel = 0.83; p < 0.001; Figure 2A) and two control datasets (Figures 2B and 2C). Moreover, the divergence between data and the bound decreased significantly (divbefore=28.52±5.29; divafter=11.38±2.27; p < 0.001). To benchmark statLTSP, we compared it to a model that aimed to minimize the necessary amount of change in both Prel and q (“shortest path”), and a model in which changes of Prel and q were chosen arbitrarily (constrained by a positive change, “random path”). Both alternative models performed worse than statLTSP (Figures 2A–2Ciii; cf. Figure S1; see STAR Methods). We also tested statLTSP on data from long-term potentiation of visual cortex layer-5 excitatory synapses (Sjöström et al., 2001Sjöström P.J. Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Rate, timing, and cooperativity jointly determine cortical synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2001; 32: 1149-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, Sjöström et al., 2007Sjöström P.J. Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Multiple forms of long-term plasticity at unitary neocortical layer 5 synapses.Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Figures 3A and 3B ). Here, too, statLTSP predicted the change in Prel and q accurately in the fitted dataset (rq = 0.94; p < 0.001; rPrel = 0.87; p < 0.001; Figure 3Aii) and the control dataset (rq = 0.82; p < 0.001; rPrel = 0.66; p < 0.001; Figure 3Bii). As in the hippocampal data, the divergence to the bound decreased after induction (divbefore=40.27±15.39; divafter=14.46±2.91; p < 0.001) and statLTSP better explains the changes in the data than the alternative models (Figures 3A and 3Biii). Notably, φ, the (independently) fitted bound, was similar in both hippocampal and visual cortex LTP experiments (φhippocampus∼0.68mV and φvisualcortex∼0.56mV), supporting statLTSP across excitatory synapses in these two brain areas. Moreover, if we set φ=1mV (for both brain areas) or reduce the size of the dataset used to estimate the bound to only 3 to 4 data points (i.e., 10%–30% of the original size), our model still captures the data and outperforms all alternative models considered here. To further validate our results, we tested whether the presynaptic changes during LTP predicted changes in short-term plasticity (Costa et al., 2017Costa R.P. Mizusaki B.E.P. Sjöström P.J. van Rossum M.C.W. Functional consequences of pre- and postsynaptic expression of synaptic plasticity.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2017; 372: 20160153Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and found that presynaptic LTP, but not postsynaptic LTP, correlated well with observed changes in short-term plasticity (rΔq = −0.1, p = 0.6; rΔPrel = 0.51, p < 0.001; Figure S2). StatLTSP suggests an optimization process toward reliable synaptic transmission. We tested whether such an optimization occurs during or after induction by analyzing the visual cortex LTP dataset (Figure S4). Our results show that statLTSP is present immediately after induction (within the first 5 min) and that it remains stable throughout the experiment (∼1 hr), suggesting that optimization happens during induction. Next we tested whether long-term depression (LTD) experiments could also be captured by our framework. Decreasing q or Prel are in principle equally viable for lowering the efficacy of a synapse (Figure 4A). However, presynaptic LTD yielded statistically more efficient changes that require fewer optimization steps to reach the bound φ=0 mV than postsynaptic LTD. This is because changing Prel more effectively controls the variance (PrelLTD is 70% to 99% better than qLTD, see Figures 4B and 4C). Therefore presynaptic LTD alone allows the postsynaptic response statistics to more quickly overlap with the lower bound (i.e., φ=0). These theoretical results give a principled explanation for presynaptic expression of LTD in agreement with previous work (Zakharenko et al., 2002Zakharenko S.S. Zablow L. Siegelbaum S.A.

Paulsen O. Rodríguez-Moreno A. Presynaptic spike timing-dependent long-term depression in the mouse hippocampus.Cereb. Cortex. 2016; 26: 3637-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consequently, the flow field reflected the data best when the bound was set such that Prel=0 while q remained stable (Figure 4E). As such, the flow field accurately predicted the locus of expression in individual visual cortex LTD experiments (rq = 0.8; p < 0.001; rPrel = 0.92; p < 0.001; Figure 4F), and the divergence decreased after LTD induction (divbefore=0.07±0.35; divafter=−0.47±0.26; p < 0.001). Moreover, as for the LTP datasets statLTSP captures LTD data substantially better than a shortest (rshort.q = −0.22; p = 0.44; rshort.Prel = 0.75; p < 0.01) and random path model (Figure 4G). The induction and extent of plastic changes is typically thought to rely on activity-dependent, Hebbian mechanisms. When we combined statLTSP with a learning rule (fitted to cortical slices) that comprises pre- and postsynaptic components (Costa et al., 2015Costa R.P. Froemke R.C. Sjöström P.J. van Rossum M.C.W. Unified pre- and postsynaptic long-term plasticity enables reliable and flexible learning.eLife. 2015; 4: e09457PubMed Google Scholar) (see STAR Methods), we were able to capture accurately the changes in q and Prel, as well as changes in the mean synaptic weight of visual cortical slices, providing a near-complete description of pre- and postsynaptic expression of long-term potentiation and depression (Figure S6). We could not capture the hippocampal LTP dataset (Figure S6), suggesting that the parameters of this visual cortical Hebbian learning rule may not be applicable to hippocampal synaptic dynamics in its current form. In our framework, the initial state of the synapse before plasticity induction plays a critical role in determining the specific post/pre ratio of change (Figure 1D). Extreme examples of such state dependency can be found in early development, when many synapses lack functional AMPA receptors, i.e., they are “postsynaptically silent.” Initial LTP at these synapses has been observed to be predominantly postsynaptic in nature (Lisman and Raghavachari, 2006Lisman J.

Our theoretical framework also captures these state-dependent results, in which synapses with low q (i.e., postsynaptically silent synapses) experience postsynaptic modifications first. Once they are unsilenced, expression is more likely to be presynaptic (Figure 5). Additionally, for the experimentally observed range of release probabilities, postsynaptic changes are more likely (Figure 5), suggesting a bias in observed expression loci that is consistent with the literature (Padamsey and Emptage, 2013Padamsey Z. Emptage N. Two sides to long-term potentiation: a view towards reconciliation.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2013; 369 (20130154–20130154)Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, our theory predicts a specific quantifiable post/pre ratio of change for each initial synaptic state (Figure 5). Alternative models are not consistent with the above experimental observations (Figures S7 and S8). StatLTSP calculates the optimal changes from a gradient descent given the statistics of postsynaptic responses and a bound. To implement statLTSP locally, (1) the postsynaptic terminal needs access to Prel, q, and the bound φ, (2) compute appropriate changes in Prel and q, and adjust q. Finally, (3) it has to inform the presynapse of appropriate changes in Prel (and/or q) for Prel to be adjusted accordingly. Such retrograde communication can be studied using pharmacological intervention. Indeed, nitric oxide (NO) blockade specifically removes the correlation between the predicted changes and observed changes in Prel (Figure 6A). Conversely, endocannabinoid (eCB) blockade specifically removes the correlations between predicted and observed changes in q (Figure 6B) and increases the correlations between predicted and observed changes in Prel (compared to non-blockade, Figures 6C and S2). Additionally, after eCB blockade there has been observed an increase in presynaptic LTP (Sjöström et al., 2007Sjöström P.J. Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B.

StatLTSP also suggests such an increase in presynaptic LTP, as illustrated by the gain in the (presynaptic) divergence after eCB blockade compared to control LTP data (divPrelctrl=11±8; divPreleCB=232±167; p < 0.05; Figures 6B and S2). These results suggest that NO initially communicates the necessary changes in Prel, which are then adjusted depending on postsynaptic changes through release of eCB (Figure 6C). In line with these observations (and congruent with our framework in which changes in q depend on Prel), we could also measure a weak negative correlation between predicted changes in Prel and observed changes in q (Figures 6B and S2). Neither shortest nor random path model could provide a similarly parsimonious explanation for any o"

In this study, we tested two treatments in an apple orchard: 1) PC treatment comprising black plastic mulch (BPM) (in-row) with weed control (inter-row); 2) and PGC treatment comprising BPM (in-row) combined with a summer cover crop (inter-row) of rape (Brassica campestris L.), which was sown in mid-June and was living from July to September. Under PGC, the inter-row soil water storage increased by 17.9% and 11.5% compared with PC after the harvest in 2013 and 2014, respectively, but there was no significant increase in 2015. The evapotranspiration (ET) from the inter-row areas during the cover crop period was lower under PGC than PC in 2013 (19.6%), 2014 (11.3%), and 2015 (13.3%). However, the differences in the total ET from the inter-row areas between the two treatments were not obvious, and the total ET from in-row areas was higher under PGC than PC due to the increased water uptake by apple trees under PGC. The apple yield, water use efficiency during the cover crop period (WUEg) and total water use efficiency (WUE) fluctuated during the experimental years. Compared with PC, the apple yield increased by 14.1%, 18.8%, and 26.7% under PGC in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. In addition, the WUEg was 26.4%, 24.7%, and 32.7% higher under PGC compared with PC in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Thus, the WUE under PGC was 13.8% and 11.7% higher than that under PC in 2013 and 2014, respectively, but the difference was not significant in 2015 (p = 0.0527). Thus, BPM combined with a summer cover crop is recommended for decreasing the summer ET and promoting apple production in rainfed dryland areas where the rainy season is usually the hot season."
https://openalex.org/W2758066387,"Background Preterm birth (<37 gestational weeks) poses a risk of poorer neurocognitive functioning. Faster growth after preterm birth predicts better cognitive abilities and can be promoted through adequate nutrition, but it remains unknown whether variations in nutrient intakes translate into long-term benefits for neurodevelopment. Methods In 86 participants of the Helsinki Study of Very Low Birth Weight Adults (birthweight <1500g), we examined if higher intakes of energy, macronutrients, and human milk during the first nine weeks after preterm birth predict performance in tests of cognitive ability at 25.1 years of age (SD = 2.1). Results 10 kcal/kg/day higher total energy intake at 3 to 6 weeks of age was associated with 0.21 SD higher adult IQ (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.07–0.35). Higher carbohydrate and fat intake at 3–6 weeks, and higher energy intake from human milk at 3–6 and at 6–9 weeks were also associated with higher adult IQ: these effect sizes ranged from 0.09 SD (95% CI 0.01–0.18) to 0.34 SD (0.14–0.54) higher IQ, per one gram/kg/day more carbohydrate and fat, and per 10 kcal/kg/day more energy from human milk. Adjustment for neonatal complications attenuated the associations: intraventricular hemorrhage, in particular, was associated with both poorer nutrition and poorer IQ. Conclusion In preterm neonates with very low birth weight, higher energy and human milk intake predict better neurocognitive abilities in adulthood. To understand the determinants of these infants' neurocognitive outcome, it seems important to take into account the role of postnatal nutrition, not just as an isolated exposure, but as a potential mediator between neonatal illness and long-term neurodevelopment."
https://openalex.org/W2758253190,"Simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) and cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET) are proven clinical techniques for treating limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). However, the ideal size and number of the limbal explants required for transplantation has not been clearly elucidated. This in vitro study aimed to determine the optimal limbal explant size required for complete corneal epithelialization by characterizing the cell expansion.Limbal explants obtained from both live and cadaveric biopsies were cultured on the denuded amniotic membrane. Explant size and the explant cell outgrowth (expansion) were measured using ImageJ software with respect to days. Cultures were characterized by assessing the rate of proliferation of cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assay along with the expression of different stem cell markers (ABCG2, p63α), corneal epithelial (CK3+12) and adherens junction molecules (E-Cadherin) by immunofluorescence.Explants from live biopsies had 80% growth potential in vitro whereas 40% of the cadaveric tissue failed to grow. Minimum explant sizes of 0.3 mm2 for live and ≥0.5 mm2 for cadaveric tissue had a mean expansion areas of 182.39±17.06 mm2 and 217.59±16.91 mm2 respectively suggesting adequate growth potential of the explants. Mean total percentage of proliferative cells was 31.80±3.81 in live and 33.49±4.25 in cadaveric tissue expansion. The expression was noted to be similar in cells cultured from cadaveric compared to cells cultured from live limbal tissue with respect to ABCG2, p63α, CK(3+12) and E-cadherin.Our findings show that a minimal amount of 0.3 mm2 live tissue would be sufficient for ample limbal cell expansion in vitro. Cadaveric explants <0.5 mm2 had poor growth potential. However, larger explants (≥ 0.5 mm2) had growth rate and proliferative potential similar to the live tissue. These findings could prove to be critical for clinical success especially while attempting cadaveric limbal transplantation. This study provides a novel clinical strategy for enhancing efficacy of the limbal transplantation surgery and opens the probability of even using the cadaveric tissue by considering the size of explant."
https://openalex.org/W2760576237,"Cardiac arrest (CA) entails significant risks of coma resulting in poor neurological and behavioral outcomes after resuscitation. Significant subsequent morbidity and mortality in post-CA patients are largely due to the cerebral and cardiac dysfunction that accompanies prolonged whole-body ischemia post-CA syndrome (PCAS). PCAS results in strong inflammatory responses including neuroinflammation response leading to poor outcome. Currently, there are no proven neuroprotective therapies to improve post-CA outcomes apart from therapeutic hypothermia. Furthermore, there are no acceptable approaches to promote cortical or cognitive arousal following successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Hypothalamic orexinergic pathway is responsible for arousal and it is negatively affected by neuroinflammation. However, whether activation of the orexinergic pathway can curtail neuroinflammation is unknown. We hypothesize that targeting the orexinergic pathway via intranasal orexin-A (ORXA) treatment will enhance arousal from coma and decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in improved functional outcome after resuscitation. We used a highly validated CA rat model to determine the effects of intranasal ORXA treatment 30-minute post resuscitation. At 4hrs post-CA, the mRNA levels of proinflammatory markers (IL1β, iNOS, TNF-α, GFAP, CD11b) and orexin receptors (ORX1R and ORX2R) were examined in different brain regions. CA dramatically increased proinflammatory markers in all brain regions particularly in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Post-CA intranasal ORXA treatment significantly ameliorated the CA-induced neuroinflammatory markers in the hypothalamus. ORXA administration increased production of orexin receptors (ORX1R and ORX2R) particularly in hypothalamus. In addition, ORXA also resulted in early arousal as measured by quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) markers, and recovery of the associated behavioral neurologic deficit scale score (NDS). Our results indicate that intranasal delivery of ORXA post-CA has an anti-inflammatory effect and accelerates cortical EEG and behavioral recovery. Beneficial outcomes from intranasal ORXA treatment lay the groundwork for therapeutic clinical approach to treating post-CA coma."

https://openalex.org/W2759562283,"Culture shapes individuals, but the measurement of cultural differences has proven a challenge. Traditional measures of cultural values focus on individual perceptions. We suggest that values are established and maintained within social communities of proximate others, such as the family and its social environment. Within such communities, values serve to maintain collective harmony whilst preserving individual agency. From a social-dynamic analysis of communities, we infer that community values of loyalty regulate individual commitment, values of honor regulate norm compliance, and values of group hierarchy maintain a division of labor. In addition, communities may regulate the ways in which individuals have independent agency. A new scale to measure these values was validated in four studies (N = 398, 112, 465 and 111) among Dutch (religious and non-religious), Turkish-Dutch, Surinamese and Turkish groups. Values and practices were measured at the level of the individual (‘What do you value?’) and at the level of the perceived community (‘What does your community value?’). Results show that, unlike individual-level measures of individualism/collectivism, this scale has excellent reliability, differentiates between cultural groups, and has predictive validity for future (voting) behavior. This approach provides a new way of conceptualizing culture, a new measure of collectivism and new insights into the role of proximate others in shaping culture."
https://openalex.org/W2757023472,"Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in childhood is common, with no explanatory pathology identified in the majority of cases. Previous studies have consistently demonstrated an association between childhood RAP and later emotional distress disorders. The aim of this study was to replicate this finding through the analysis of a large dataset, and explore how a negative style of thinking could potentially influence this relationship.The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a population cohort of children born in the Avon area of the UK, between 1991-1992. Data on childhood RAP was collected via maternal reports at 3, 4, 7 and 9 years. Mood, anxiety and cognitive style were measured at age 18. We controlled for various confounding factors, including maternal anxiety and the child's pre-existing psychopathology. Logistic regression models were used to examine associations, and moderation effects of cognitive style were analysed using likelihood ratios.Experiencing RAP at any one time-point is associated with an increased odds of depression and/or anxiety disorder at 18 (OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.09-1.83). We found a dose-response relationship and each additional marker of RAP was associated with a 26% (CI: 7% to 47%) increase in risk of having a mood and/or anxiety disorder. Individuals who attribute adversity to global, stable or personal factors were at amplified risk.Childhood RAP predicts depression and anxiety disorders at 18 and should be targeted for early intervention. Individuals with a negative cognitive style may be particularly vulnerable, suggesting that cognitive interpretations of physical symptoms could play an important role in long-term health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2758892932,"Background Overactive bladder (OAB) is one of the most prevalent lower urinary tract conditions and has been suggested to be related to various factors. We assessed the prevalence of and factors associated with OAB in women based on a large cross-sectional, population-based study of adult Korean women. Methods The Korean community health survey (KCHS) of 2012 was reviewed, and 107,950 female participants aged 19 to 107 years were identified for inclusion in this study. The overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) was used to define and classify OAB as mild, moderate, or severe. Numerous variables, including marital status; physical activity; education and income levels; type of occupation; body mass index (BMI); smoking; alcohol; sleep time; and medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or cerebral stroke, were evaluated. The correlation of these variables with the prevalence of OAB was analyzed using simple and multiple logistic regression analyses with complex sampling. Results The results showed that 5.2% of adult women experienced OAB. Multiple regression analyses showed a significant correlation between the following variables and OAB: older age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–1.50, P < 0.001 as 10 years older); married status (AOR = 0.83, 95%CI = 0.70–0.96, P = 0.016); lower level of income (AOR = 1.50, 95%CI = 1.34–1.68, P < 0.001); high BMI (AOR = 1.33, 95%CI = 1.23–1.44, P < 0.001); smoking (AOR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.04–1.47, P < 0.001); long sleep time (AOR = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.69–2.26); and medical history of hypertension (AOR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.03–1.21, P = 0.011), diabetes mellitus (AOR = 1.38, 95%CI = 1.25–1.53, P < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (AOR = 1.27, 95%CI = 1.16–1.39, P < 0.001), and cerebral stroke (AOR = 2.04, 95%CI = 1.73–2.41, P < 0.001). The level of stress showed a dose-dependent association with OAB (AOR [95%CI] = 3.28 [2.81–3.83] > 2.11 [1.91–2.33] >1.28 [1.16–1.41] for severe > moderate > some stress, respectively, P < 0.001). Conclusion The prevalence of OAB was approximately 5.2% among adult Korean women. Older age; high BMI; stress level; sleep duration; levels of income and education; marital status; smoking; and medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and cerebral stroke were significantly related to OAB in women."
https://openalex.org/W2990158649,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a large class of persistent organic pollutants that are potentially harmful to human and wildlife health. Although a small number of dioxin-like (DL) PCBs are well characterized, the majority of PCBs have non-dioxin-like (NDL) modes of action and biological effects that are less understood. We conducted a dose-response study of the skeletal and dental effects of in utero/lactational exposure to 2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-heptachlorobiphenyl (PCB 180), a NDL PCB congener that is abundantly present in the environment and foods, including mother's milk. In a sample of 35- and 84-day-old male and female offspring from pregnant rats exposed to different doses of PCB 180 (0, 10, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg bw), we measured the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of 27 landmarks on the craniofacial skeleton with a Microscribe G2X system, the buccolingual width of all molars with digital sliding calipers, and a variety of tibial parameters with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and a biomechanical testing apparatus. The landmark coordinates were analyzed for variation in size, shape, and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) using MorphoJ software, showing no effects on cranial size, on FA in females only (i.e., decreased asymmetry), and on shape in both sexes (i.e., decreased facial length and shift in the palatal suture). In the maxillary teeth, females in the highest dose group showed a significant decrease of 0.1 mm (p = 0.033) of the second molar only, whereas males in most dose groups showed average increases of 0.1 mm (p = 0.006-0.044) in all three molars. In the mandibular teeth, the only significant response to PCB 180 exposure was the average increase of 0.1 mm (p = 0.001-0.025) in the third molars of males only. Males also shower greater sensitivity in postcranial effects of increased tibial length and decreased cortical bone mass density, although only females showed significant effects on tibial bone area and thickness. These results demonstrate marked sex differences in effects of PCB 180, which can be attributed to differences in their underlying biological mechanisms of toxicity. Furthermore, although tooth and bone development are targets of both DL and NDL compounds, this study shows that there are marked differences in their mechanisms and effects."
https://openalex.org/W2758326685,"In the cooperative breeding common marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus, fathers share the care responsibility and energetic load with their mate from the time their infants are born. However, not all fathers show the same level of participation in direct infant care. Here we present the first results demonstrating that fathering style can improve both survival and growth trajectory of a male’s offspring during the first 30 weeks of life and that these infant outcomes are consistent within a father throughout successive births. Twenty-four marmoset fathers were tested for their responsiveness to an infant distress call when their infants were approximately two weeks old. These fathers were categorized as either responsive (RS) or nonresponsive (NRS) based on their response to the calls. Survival past 1 month was then determined and bi-monthly weights of current infants through 30 weeks of age were taken. Infant survival to the first month was significantly higher with RS fathers than with NRS fathers during this critical time period. Infants from RS fathers also had a higher growth trajectory with significant differences in body weight in the 28th and 30th week after birth. Only the RS fathers showed a significant increase in serum testosterone in response to infant cries suggesting a physiological role of testosterone in the motivation to search for the infant. Furthermore, all offspring born to RS fathers from subsequent births also showed a significantly higher survival rate and higher growth trajectory than for offspring of NRS fathers. These results suggest that fathering style is a consistent trait and responsive fathers improve infant survival rate and growth during the first 30 weeks. Such fathering style traits may be passed on to the male offspring due to environmental or genetic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2758859773,Studies carried out in Moscow residents have revealed that the prevalence of chronic toxoplasmosis is very close to those in countries of Eastern and Central Europe. Our findings also demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between the rate of traffic accidents and the seroprevalence of chronic toxoplasmosis in drivers who were held responsible for accidents. The latter was 2.37 times higher in drivers who were involved in road accidents compared with control groups. These results suggest that the consequences of chronic toxoplasmosis (particularly a slower reaction time and decreased concentration) might contribute to the peculiarities of the epidemiology of road traffic accidents in the Russian Federation and might interfere with the successful implementation of the Federal Programme named “Increase road traffic safety”. Suggestions for how to address overcome this problem are discussed in this paper.
https://openalex.org/W2760348166,"Obesity and cigarette smoking are correlated through complex relationships. Common genetic causes may contribute to these correlations. In this study, we selected 241 loci potentially associated with body mass index (BMI) based on the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium data and calculated a BMI genetic risk score (BMI-GRS) for 17,037 individuals of European descent from the Oncoarray Project of the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO). Smokers had a significantly higher BMI-GRS than never-smokers (p = 0.016 and 0.010 before and after adjustment for BMI, respectively). The BMI-GRS was also positively correlated with pack-years of smoking (p<0.001) in smokers. Based on causal network inference analyses, seven and five of 241 SNPs were classified to pleiotropic models for BMI/smoking status and BMI/pack-years, respectively. Among them, three and four SNPs associated with smoking status and pack-years (p<0.05), respectively, were followed up in the ever-smoking data of the Tobacco, Alcohol and Genetics (TAG) consortium. Among these seven candidate SNPs, one SNP (rs11030104, BDNF) achieved statistical significance after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, and three suggestive SNPs (rs13021737, TMEM18; rs11583200, ELAVL4; and rs6990042, SGCZ) achieved a nominal statistical significance. Our results suggest that there is a common genetic component between BMI and smoking, and pleiotropy analysis can be useful to identify novel genetic loci of complex phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2757801081,"Heartwater, or cowdriosis, is a tick-borne disease of domestic and wild ruminants that is endemic in the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is caused by an intracellular pathogen, Ehrlichia ruminantium and may be fatal within days of the onset of clinical signs with mortality rates of up to 90% in susceptible hosts. Due to the presence of competent tick vectors in North America, there is substantial risk of introduction of heartwater with potentially devastating consequences to the domestic livestock industry. There is currently no reliable or safe vaccine for use globally. To develop a protective DIVA (differentiate infected from vaccinated animals) subunit vaccine for heartwater, we targeted the E. ruminantium immunodominant major antigenic protein1 (MAP1) with the hypothesis that MAP1 is a glycosylated protein and glycans contained in the antigenic protein are important epitope determinants. Using a eukaryotic recombinant baculovirus expression system, we expressed and characterized, for the first time, a glycoform profile of MAP1 of two Caribbean E. ruminantium isolates, Antigua and Gardel. We have shown that the 37-38 kDa protein corresponded to a glycosylated form of the MAP1 protein, whereas the 31-32 kDa molecular weight band represented the non-glycosylated form of the protein frequently reported in scientific literature. Three groups of sheep (n = 3-6) were vaccinated with increasing doses of a bivalent (Antigua and Gardel MAP1) rMAP1 vaccine cocktail formulation with montanide ISA25 as an adjuvant. The glycosylated recombinant subunit vaccine induced E. ruminantium-specific humoral and Th1 type T cell responses, which are critical for controlling intracellular pathogens, including E. ruminantium, in infected hosts. These results provide an important basis for development of a subunit vaccine as a novel strategy to protect susceptible livestock against heartwater in non-endemic and endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2760333800,"In vivo turnover rates of proteins covering the processes of protein synthesis and breakdown rates have been measured in many tissues and protein pools using various techniques. Connective tissue and collagen protein turnover is of specific interest since existing results are rather diverging. The aim of this study is to investigate whether we can verify the presence of protein pools within the same tissue with very distinct turnover rates over the life-span of rats with special focus on connective tissue. Male and female Lewis rats (n = 35) were injected with five different isotopically labeled amino acids tracers. The tracers were injected during fetal development (Day -10 to -2), after birth (Day 5-9), at weaning (Day 25-32) at puberty (Day 54-58) and at adulthood (Day 447-445). Subgroups of rats were euthanized three days after every injection period, at different time point between injection periods and lastly at day 472. Tissue (liver, muscle, eye lens and patellar tendon) and blood samples were collected after euthanization. The enrichment of the labeled amino acids in the tissue or blood samples was measured using GC-MS-MS. In muscle and liver we demonstrated a rapid decrease of tracer enrichments throughout the rat's life, indicating that myofibrillar and cytoskeleton proteins have a high turnover. In contrast, the connective tissue protein in the eye lens and patellar tendon of the mature rat showed detainment of tracer enrichment injected during fetal development and first living days, indicating very slow turnover. The data support the hypothesis that some proteins synthesized during the early development and growth still exist much later in life of animals and hence has a very slow turnover rate."
https://openalex.org/W2758496413,"Objective The adenoma detection rate (ADR) varies widely between physicians, possibly due to patient population differences, hampering direct ADR comparison. We developed and validated a prediction model for adenoma detection in an effort to determine if physicians’ ADRs should be adjusted for patient-related factors. Materials and methods Screening and surveillance colonoscopy data from the cross-sectional multicenter cluster-randomized Endoscopic Quality Improvement Program-3 (EQUIP-3) study (NCT02325635) was used. The dataset was split into two cohorts based on center. A prediction model for detection of ≥1 adenoma was developed using multivariable logistic regression and subsequently internally (bootstrap resampling) and geographically validated. We compared predicted to observed ADRs. Results The derivation (5 centers, 35 physicians, overall-ADR: 36%) and validation (4 centers, 31 physicians, overall-ADR: 40%) cohort included respectively 9934 and 10034 patients (both cohorts: 48% male, median age 60 years). Independent predictors for detection of ≥1 adenoma were: age (optimism-corrected odds ratio (OR): 1.02; 95%-confidence interval (CI): 1.02–1.03), male sex (OR: 1.73; 95%-CI: 1.60–1.88), body mass index (OR: 1.02; 95%-CI: 1.01–1.03), American Society of Anesthesiology physical status class (OR class II vs. I: 1.29; 95%-CI: 1.17–1.43, OR class ≥III vs. I: 1.57; 95%-CI: 1.32–1.86), surveillance versus screening (OR: 1.39; 95%-CI: 1.27–1.53), and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (OR: 1.13; 95%-CI: 1.00–1.27). The model’s discriminative ability was modest (C-statistic in the derivation: 0.63 and validation cohort: 0.60). The observed ADR was considerably lower than predicted for 12/66 (18.2%) physicians and 2/9 (22.2%) centers, and considerably higher than predicted for 18/66 (27.3%) physicians and 4/9 (44.4%) centers. Conclusion The substantial variation in ADRs could only partially be explained by patient-related factors. These data suggest that ADR variation could likely also be due to other factors, e.g. physician or technical issues."
https://openalex.org/W2759718480,"Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a typical plasticizer used for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) blood containers, is eluted from the blood containers and exerts protective effects on red blood cells. However, a concern for detrimental effects of DEHP on human health has led to the development of potential DEHP substitutes. Here, we compared the red blood cell preservation ability of two types of non-DEHP blood containers with safe alternative plasticizers to that of DEHP blood containers. Red cell concentrates in mannitol-adenine-phosphate solution (MAP/RCC) were stored for 6 weeks in PVC blood bags containing DEHP, di-isononyl-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH) and di (2-ethylhexyl) 4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylate (DOTH), or 4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid dinonyl ester (DL9TH) and DOTH. There was no significant difference in the total amount of plasticizer eluted into MAP/RCC (till 3 weeks from the beginning of the experiment), hemolysis of MAP/RCC, and osmotic fragility of MAP/RCC between the non-DEHP blood containers and DEHP blood containers. Hematological and blood chemical indices of MAP/RCC in all containers were nearly the same. Thus, DOTH/DINCH and DOTH/DL9TH blood containers demonstrate the same quality of MAP/RCC storing as the DEHP blood containers. Since DOTH, DINCH, and DL9TH were reported to be safe, DOTH/DINCH and DOTH/DL9TH blood containers are promising candidate substitutes for DEHP blood containers."

Loss of its expression has been implicated in tumorigenesis in a range of different cancers, and overexpression during fetal development causes transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). PLAGL1 lies within an imprinted region of chromosome 6q24, and monoallelic expression from the major, differentially methylated promoter (P1) occurs in most human tissues. However, in peripheral blood leukocytes, the active promoter (P2) is non-imprinted and drives biallelic transcription. We report here a novel PLAGL1 promoter (P5) derived from the insertion of a primate-specific, MIR3 SINE retrotransposon.
