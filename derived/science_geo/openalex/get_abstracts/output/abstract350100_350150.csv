Their evolution by secondary endocytobiosis resulted in a complex cellular structure and metabolism compared to algae with primary plastids. Methodology/Principal Findings The whole genome sequence of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum has recently been completed. We identified and annotated genes for enzymes involved in carbohydrate pathways based on extensive EST support and comparison to the whole genome sequence of a second diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana. Protein localization to mitochondria was predicted based on identified similarities to mitochondrial localization motifs in other eukaryotes, whereas protein localization to plastids was based on the presence of signal peptide motifs in combination with plastid localization motifs previously shown to be required in diatoms. We identified genes potentially involved in a C4-like photosynthesis in P. tricornutum and, on the basis of sequence-based putative localization of relevant proteins, discuss possible differences in carbon concentrating mechanisms and CO2 fixation between the two diatoms. We also identified genes encoding enzymes involved in photorespiration with one interesting exception: glycerate kinase was not found in either P. tricornutum or T. pseudonana. Various Calvin cycle enzymes were found in up to five different isoforms, distributed between plastids, mitochondria and the cytosol. Diatoms store energy either as lipids or as chrysolaminaran (a β-1,3-glucan) outside of the plastids. We identified various β-glucanases and large membrane-bound glucan synthases. Interestingly most of the glucanases appear to contain C-terminal anchor domains that may attach the enzymes to membranes. Conclusions/Significance Here we present a detailed synthesis of carbohydrate metabolism in diatoms based on the genome sequences of Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. This model provides novel insights into acquisition of dissolved inorganic carbon and primary metabolic pathways of carbon in two different diatoms, which is of significance for an improved understanding of global carbon cycles."

In both of these cell types S. aureus promptly escapes from the endosomes/phagosomes and proliferates within the cytoplasm, which quickly leads to host cell death. In this report we show that S. aureus interacted with human monocyte-derived macrophages in a very different way to those of other mammalian cells. Upon phagocytosis by macrophages, S. aureus persisted intracellularly in vacuoles for 3-4 days before escaping into the cytoplasm and causing host cell lysis. Until the point of host cell lysis the infected macrophages showed no signs of apoptosis or necrosis and were functional. They were able to eliminate intracellular staphylococci if prestimulated with interferon-gamma at concentrations equivalent to human therapeutic doses. S. aureus survival was dependent on the alternative sigma factor B as well as the global regulator agr, but not SarA. Furthermore, isogenic mutants deficient in alpha-toxin, the metalloprotease aureolysin, protein A, and sortase A were efficiently killed by macrophages upon phagocytosis, although with different kinetics. In particular alpha-toxin was a key effector molecule that was essential for S. aureus intracellular survival in macrophages. Together, our data indicate that the ability of S. aureus to survive phagocytosis by macrophages is determined by multiple virulence factors in a way that differs considerably from its interactions with other cell types. S. aureus persists inside macrophages for several days without affecting the viability of these mobile cells which may serve as vehicles for the dissemination of infection."
https://openalex.org/W1994217011,"The physiological conditions under which adenosine A2A receptors modulate synaptic transmission are presently unclear. We show that A2A receptors are localized postsynaptically at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells and are essential for a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA-EPSCs induced by short bursts of mossy fiber stimulation. This LTP spares AMPA-EPSCs and is likely induced and expressed postsynaptically. It depends on a postsynaptic Ca2+ rise, on G protein activation, and on Src kinase. In addition to A2A receptors, LTP of NMDA-EPSCs requires the activation of NMDA and mGluR5 receptors as potential sources of Ca2+ increase. LTP of NMDA-EPSCs displays a lower threshold for induction as compared with the conventional presynaptic mossy fiber LTP; however, the two forms of LTP can combine with stronger induction protocols. Thus, postsynaptic A2A receptors may potentially affect information processing in CA3 neuronal networks and memory performance.

Thus, postsynaptic A2A receptors may potentially affect information processing in CA3 neuronal networks and memory performance. Dynamic changes in synaptic efficacy provide a cellular basis for information storage in the nervous system. In its most classical forms, long-term changes in the strength of synaptic transmission are expressed as a modification of the amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents (AMPA-EPSCs) that require the activation of NMDA receptors (Malenka and Bear, 2004Malenka R.C. Bear M.F. LTP and LTD: An embarrassment of riches.Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). In turn, little is known about forms of synaptic plasticity that specifically affect NMDA receptors. LTP of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission has been reported (Bashir et al., 1991Bashir Z.I. Alford S. Davies S.N. Randall A.D. Collingridge G.L.

It is well established that NMDA receptors and NMDA-EPSCs can be modulated by a variety of cell-signaling molecules converging through G protein coupled receptors to Src family kinases (Salter and Kalia, 2004Salter M.W.

Signaling molecules and receptor transduction cascades that regulate NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission.Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2003; 54: 51-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the physiological conditions under which these pathways are activated to regulate NMDA EPSCs are presently unclear. Adenosine is such a modulatory substance since the pharmacological activation of adenosine A2A receptors regulates NMDA receptor function (Tebano et al., 2005Tebano M.T. Martire A. Rebola N. Pepponi R. Domenici M.R. Gro M.C. Schwarzschild M.A. Chen J.F. Cunha R.A. Popoli P. Adenosine A2A receptors and mGluR5 are co-localized and functionally interact in the hippocampus: a possible key mechanism in the modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate effects.J.

Adenosine A2A receptor-induced inhibition of NMDA and GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in a subpopulation of rat striatal neurons.Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 994-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, the role of adenosine depends mainly on its action on the G protein coupled A1 and A2A receptors (Fredholm et al., 2005Fredholm B.B. Chen J.F. Cunha R.A. Svenningsson P. Vaugeois J.M. Adenosine and brain function.Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2005; 63: 191-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, Dunwiddie and Masino, 2001Dunwiddie T.V. Masino S.A. The role and regulation of adenosine in the central nervous system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 31-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). A2A receptors are abundantly expressed in the striatum but are also present in the limbic system and neocortex (Tebano et al., 2005Tebano M.T. Martire A. Rebola N. Pepponi R. Domenici M.R. Gro M.C. Schwarzschild M.A. Chen J.F. Cunha R.A. Popoli P. Adenosine A2A receptors and mGluR5 are co-localized and functionally interact in the hippocampus: a possible key mechanism in the modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate effects.J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1188-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Rebola et al., 2005Rebola N. Canas P.M. Oliveira C.R. Cunha R.A. Different synaptic and subsynaptic localization of adenosine A2A receptors in the hippocampus and striatum of the rat.Neuroscience. 2005; 132: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Their presence in synapses suggests a role for A2A receptors in controlling synaptic transmission, either by presynaptic mechanisms or by regulating NMDA receptor function (Rebola et al., 2005Rebola N. Canas P.M. Oliveira C.R. Cunha R.A. Different synaptic and subsynaptic localization of adenosine A2A receptors in the hippocampus and striatum of the rat.Neuroscience. 2005; 132: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The consequences of A2A receptor activation on synaptic transmission in physiological conditions of adenosine release have however remained elusive. The ambient level of adenosine is sufficient to activate A1 but not A2A receptors, possibly due to differences in affinity (Ciruela et al., 2006Ciruela F. Casado V. Rodrigues R.J. Lujan R. Burgueno J. Canals M. Borycz J. Rebola N. Goldberg S.R. Mallol J. et al.Presynaptic control of striatal glutamatergic neurotransmission by adenosine A1–A2A receptor heteromers.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2080-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). High-frequency bursts of stimulation, which trigger transient release of ATP, may promote conditions where ATP-derived adenosine activates A2A receptors (Cunha, 2001Cunha R.A. Adenosine as a neuromodulator and as a homeostatic regulator in the nervous system: different roles, different sources and different receptors.Neurochem. Int. 2001; 38: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). As these conditions can also induce different forms of short- and long-term synaptic plasticity, activation of A2A receptors by endogenous adenosine may play a role in these processes. We studied the role of A2A receptors at synapses between hippocampal mossy fibers (Mf) and CA3 pyramidal cells. First, Mf synapses display robust and well-characterized presynaptic forms of synaptic plasticity (Henze et al., 2000Henze D.A. Urban N.N. Barrionuevo G. The multifarious hippocampal mossy fiber pathway: a review.Neuroscience. 2000; 98: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005Nicoll R.A. Schmitz D. Synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) in response to sustained presynaptic activity, conditions which may promote the increase of adenosine in the extracellular space. Second, while it is known that Mf synapses do not display NMDA-receptor dependent LTP of AMPA-EPSCs, selective changes in NMDA-EPSCs have never been addressed at these synapses. We found no evidence for functional presynaptic A2A receptors at Mf synapses. In contrast, we report that postsynaptic A2A receptors mediate a form of LTP of NMDA-EPSCs induced by short bursts of Mf stimulation. This LTP is expressed postsynaptically, depends on an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and requires the coactivation of NMDA receptors and mGluR5 in addition to A2A receptors. LTP of NMDA EPSCs displays a low induction threshold as compared to conventional presynaptic Mf LTP. Consequently, protocols used to trigger presynaptic LTP lead to a robust potentiation of NMDA-EPSCs resulting from the combination of pre- and postsynaptic actions. Mf-EPSCs were recorded from CA3 pyramidal cells in the whole-cell voltage-clamp mode. The selective A2A receptor antagonists SCH 58261 (50 nM) or ZM 241385 (50 nM) did not affect AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs (AMPA-EPSCs) recorded at a rate of stimulation of 0.1 Hz (Figure 1A). Since sustained synaptic activity can increase extracellular adenosine levels, we increased the frequency of stimulation from 0.1 Hz to either 1 Hz or to 3 Hz (528% ± 73%, n = 11, and 775% ± 105%, n = 12, respectively). This lead to a prominent facilitation of Mf-EPSCs that was not significantly affected when repeating the same protocol in the presence of 50 nM SCH 58261 (at 1 Hz, 481% ± 66% of control, n = 11, p = 0.6; at 3 Hz, 788% ± 112% of control, n = 12, p = 0.8) or 50 nM ZM 241385 (at 1 Hz, 464% ± 68%, n = 6; Figures 1A and 1B). SCH 58261 (50 nM) also failed to affect synaptic facilitation triggered by a train of 5 stimuli at 25 Hz (fifth versus first EPSC, control: 813 ± 123, n = 5; SCH 58261: 869 ± 245, n = 5). We further attempted to activate presynaptic A2A receptors at Mf synapses with the A2A receptor agonist, CGS 21680 (30 nM). CGS 21680 failed to alter basal synaptic transmission (0.1 Hz; Figure 1A) and frequency facilitation (at 1 Hz, 465% ± 79%, n = 6; Figures 1A and 1B). Finally, we evaluated the potential role of A2A receptors in Mf LTP which is presynaptic NMDA-receptor independent form of synaptic plasticity that depends on Ca2+ entry in the Mf nerve terminal (Henze et al., 2000Henze D.A. Urban N.N. Barrionuevo G. The multifarious hippocampal mossy fiber pathway: a review.Neuroscience. 2000; 98: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005Nicoll R.A. Schmitz D. Synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, for review). We induced presynaptic Mf LTP with a high frequency stimulation protocol (100 pulses at a frequency of 100 Hz repeated 3 times with a 10 s intertrain interval), in the presence of bicuculline (10 μM) and D-AP5 (50 μM). In these conditions, the extent of Mf LTP was not significantly (p = 0.8) different in control conditions and in the presence of 50 nM SCH 58261 (Figures 1C and 1D). Altogether these data indicate that presynaptic A2A receptors do not modulate glutamatergic synaptic transmission and do not participate in presynaptic forms of synaptic plasticity at Mf synapses. In contrast, we confirmed that Mf synaptic transmission was highly sensitive to A1 receptor activation. Application of the mixed A1/A2 receptor agonist, CADO (10 μM), reduced EPSCs to 31% ± 5% of control (n = 7; see Figure S1 available online) an effect strongly attenuated by the A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX (100 nM; 80% ± 9%, n = 10; Figure S1). DPCPX (100 nM) increased Mf-EPSCs to 156% ± 23% (n = 8; Figure S1), indicating that endogenous levels of adenosine tonically inhibit Mf-EPSCs through A1 receptor activation. Both A1 receptor ligands (agonist and antagonist) modified Mf-EPSCs but did not change the frequency facilitation ratio (1 Hz/0.1 Hz; Figure S1), in agreement with previous work (Kukley et al., 2005Kukley M. Schwan M. Fredholm B.B. Dietrich D. The role of extracellular adenosine in regulating mossy fiber synaptic plasticity.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2832-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, but see Moore et al., 2003Moore K.A. Nicoll R.A. Schmitz D. Adenosine gates synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 14397-14402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Finally, we found that the inhibitory effect of CADO (10 μM) on EPSCs was not affected by the presence of 50 nM SCH 58261 (27% ± 4%, n = 5; p = 0.9 in comparison with the effect of CADO alone; Figure S1), ruling out a possible interaction between the two receptor systems, as described in CA1 synapses (Lopes et al., 2002Lopes L.V. Cunha R.A. Kull B. Fredholm B.B. Ribeiro J.A. Adenosine A2A receptor facilitation of hippocampal synaptic transmission is dependent on tonic A1 receptor inhibition.Neuroscience. 2002; 112: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that A2A receptors are not functionally present presynaptically at Mf synapses, in contrast with A1 receptors. Even though A2A receptors are enriched in biochemically purified presynaptic fractions of the hippocampus, around 30% of the A2A receptor signal is also observed in the postsynaptic fraction (Rebola et al., 2005Rebola N. Canas P.M. Oliveira C.R. Cunha R.A. Different synaptic and subsynaptic localization of adenosine A2A receptors in the hippocampus and striatum of the rat.Neuroscience. 2005; 132: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We thus directly evaluated by electron microscopy the subcellular distribution of A1 and A2A receptors in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region of the hippocampus, a region consisting primarily of pyramidal cell dendrites and dendritic spines establishing type I synapses with Mf terminals. Using a pre-embedding immunogold method, gold particles for A1 receptors were found mainly distributed presynaptically along the extrasynaptic plasma membrane (arrowheads) of Mf terminals (Figures 2A and 2B) as well as along active zones (Figure 2A). Occasionally, a few gold particles labeling A1 receptors were also detected at postsynaptic sites along the extrasynaptic plasma membrane of dendritic spines of CA3 pyramidal cells (Figure 2A), although this only represented 4.3% (n = 3) of all gold particles examined for A1 receptors (Figure 2G). In contrast to the predominant presynaptic localization of A1 receptors, gold particles for A2A receptors were mainly distributed at postsynaptic sites along the extrasynaptic plasma membrane (arrowheads) of dendritic spines of CA3 pyramidal cells (Figures 2C and 2D). Furthermore, some gold particles were also observed at perisynaptic positions or embedded in the postsynaptic densities of dendritic spines of CA3 pyramidal cells (Figure 2D). Occasionally, a few gold particles for A2A receptors were also detected at presynaptic sites along the extrasynaptic plasma membrane of Mf terminals (Figure 2D). Immunoparticles in postsynaptic sites represented 96.4% (n = 3) of all gold particles examined for A2A receptors. The distance between the closest edge of the postsynaptic density and the center of the immunoparticles along the spine membrane was measured, showing that gold particles labeling A2A receptors are localized within a 1 μm diameter from the postsynaptic density (Figure 2H). Using a postembedding immunogold method, the only immunohistochemical technique that allows the unambiguous detection of any protein at postsynaptic densities of type I synapses, we confirmed this different subsynaptic distributions of A1 and A2A receptors, with A1 receptors mainly localized presynaptically (Figure 2E) and A2A receptors mainly localized postsynaptically (Figure 2F). The postsynaptic distribution of A2A receptors at Mf synapses prompted us to examine their potential role in the regulation of synaptic transmission by acting at a postsynaptic level. Our previous experiments (AMPA-EPSCs recorded at 0.1 Hz) showed no effect of the A2A receptor agonist, CGS 21680 on AMPA-EPSCs. However, previous studies have suggested that A2A receptor agonists either inhibit (Wirkner et al., 2004Wirkner K. Gerevich Z. Krause T. Gunther A. Koles L. Schneider D. Norenberg W. Illes P. Adenosine A2A receptor-induced inhibition of NMDA and GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in a subpopulation of rat striatal neurons.Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 994-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or positively modulate (Tebano et al., 2005Tebano M.T. Martire A. Rebola N. Pepponi R. Domenici M.R. Gro M.C. Schwarzschild M.A. Chen J.F. Cunha R.A. Popoli P. Adenosine A2A receptors and mGluR5 are co-localized and functionally interact in the hippocampus: a possible key mechanism in the modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate effects.J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1188-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) NMDA receptor function. We thus examined if postsynaptic A2A receptors could selectively control NMDA-EPSCs at Mf synapses. NMDA-EPSCs were recorded in CA3 pyramidal cells voltage clamped at +30 mV in the presence of 20 μM NBQX (to block AMPA and kainate receptors), 10 μM bicuculline and 3 μM CGP55845 (to block GABAA and GABAB, respectively). Superfusion of the A2A receptor agonist, CGS 21680 (30 nM), increased NMDA-EPSCs by 41% ± 13% (n = 6, p = 0.03; Figures 3A, 3B, and 3D). This effect was blocked by SCH 58261 (50 nM), which by itself did not change the amplitude of NMDA-EPSCs (Figures 3B, 3C, and 3D). CGS 21680 (30 nM) also potentiated NMDA-EPSCs recorded at −50 mV in the presence of 0.3 mM extracellular Mg2+ concentration to the same extent (135% ± 9%, n = 4). Thus, activation of A2A receptors selectively potentiates NMDA-EPSCs at Mf synapses. As this effect is not observed for AMPA-EPSCs (see Figure 1), it is unlikely to be mediated by a presynaptic action on glutamate release. Together with the morphological data, this indicates a modulation of NMDA-EPSCs by postsynaptic A2A receptors. We then examined the physiological conditions under which extracellular adenosine might regulate NMDA-EPSCs through activation of A2A receptors. The fact that the selective A2A receptor antagonist SCH 58261 failed to affect NMDA-EPSCs under basal stimulation conditions (0.1 Hz) indicates that there is no tonic activation of A2A receptors by ambient adenosine, unlike for presynaptic A1 receptors. Neurochemical studies in hippocampal slices have indicated that sustained high frequency electrical simulation (60 pulses at 50 Hz repeated 4 times) was required to record an activation of A2A receptors by endogenous adenosine (Pinto-Duarte et al., 2005Pinto-Duarte A. Coelho J.E. Cunha R.A. Ribeiro J.A. Sebastião A.M. Adenosine A2A receptors control the extracellular levels of adenosine through modulation of nucleoside transporters activity in the rat hippocampus.J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested if high-frequency stimulation of mossy fibers would promote A2A receptor-mediated facilitation of NMDA-EPSCs. A burst of 60 stimuli delivered at a rate of 50 Hz induced a pronounced potentiation of NMDA-EPSCs recorded at + 30 mV (167% ± 7%, 30–40 min after the burst, n = 6) that lasted for the 40 min of recording (Figures 4A and 4D). We examined if this LTP of NMDA-EPSCs depended on A2A receptor activation. In the presence of SCH 58261 (50 nM) a robust posttetanic potentiation was observed but it was not followed by LTP of NMDA-EPSCs (103% ± 7%, 30–40 min after the bursts, n = 5; Figures 4B and 4D). To exclude the possibility that holding the cell at positive potentials contributes to the observed LTP, we recorded NMDA-EPSCs in low Mg2+ medium (0.3 mM Mg2+) while holding the cell at −50 mV. In these conditions LTP of NMDA-EPSCs was also observed (172% ± 27%, 30–40 min after the bursts, n = 11; Figures 4C and 4D). In the rest of the study we have recorded NMDA-EPSCs at −50 mV in low Mg2+ concentration, unless otherwise stated. The fact that the A2A receptor antagonist blocked LTP of NMDA-EPSCs but did not affect conventional presynaptic Mf LTP (see Figure 1) suggests that these two forms of synaptic plasticities operate through different mechanisms. We further analyzed the A2A receptor-dependent LTP of NMDA-EPSCs. As a first step, we investigated the conditions for triggering LTP of NMDA-EPSCs. The 60 stimuli protocol at 50 Hz was initially chosen based on earlier neurochemical results describing A2A receptor-mediated effects in the hippocampus (Pinto-Duarte et al., 2005Pinto-Duarte A. Coelho J.E. Cunha R.A. Ribeiro J.A. Sebastião A.M. Adenosine A2A receptors control the extracellular levels of adenosine through modulation of nucleoside transporters activity in the rat hippocampus.J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because dentate granule cells tend to fire in bursts, we used short bursts of 6 stimuli at 50 Hz separated by 150 ms to mimic the frequency of theta oscillation (Figure 5A). Three bursts of 6 stimuli induced LTP of NMDA-EPSCs (133% ± 11%, 20–30 min after the bursts, n = 9; Figures 5A and 5B). The magnitude of LTP was further enhanced with 6 and 10 consecutive bursts at 50 Hz within the same experiment (Figures 5A and 5B). We also quantified the effects of 6 and 10 bursts of stimuli in separate slices (which had not received previous bursts of stimuli) and found that LTP was close to saturation in response to the 6 bursts stimulation protocol (6 bursts: 174% ± 15%, n = 6; 10 bursts: 191% ± 30%, n = 6, 20–30 min after the bursts; Figure 5C). In the rest of the study, LTP was induced by the 6 bursts stimulation protocol. The A2A receptor antagonist SCH 58261 (50 nM) similarly blocked LTP of NMDA-EPSCs induced by the 6 bursts stimulation protocol (92% ± 8%, 30–40 min after the bursts, n = 6) and by the sustained stimulation at 50 Hz (see Figure 6D).Figure 6Adenosine Activating Postsynaptic A2A Receptors Likely Originates from the Extracellular Catabolism of Adenine NucleotidesShow full caption(A and B) Average time courses of normalized Mf NMDA-EPSCs recorded in the presence of either the ecto-ATPase inhibitor, ARL 67156 (100 μM, n = 8 [A]), or the ecto-5′-nucleotidase inhibitor AOPCP (100 μ, n = 8 [B]).

Values are presented as mean ± SEM of n experiments. The six bursts protocol did not induce LTP of AMPA-EPSCs. Indeed the amplitude of AMPA-EPSCs recorded in the presence of D-AP5 (50 μM) was not significantly affected by this protocol (113% ± 20%, 30–40 min after the bursts, n = 6, p = 0.4; Figures S2A and S2B). It could be argued that the lack of LTP for AMPA-EPSCs is linked to the inhibition of NMDA receptors by D-AP5. We thus monitored in parallel the changes in AMPA and NMDA-EPSCs before and after LTP induction with both receptors active during and after the six bursts stimulation protocol. For this, we recorded in the same cells Mf EPSCs at +30 and at −70 mV in 1.3 mM extracellular Mg2+ concentration. The cells were held at −70 mV, including during the 6 bursts stimulation protocol, and the potential was changed to +30 mV for less than 1 min to record NMDA-EPSCs. This protocol avoided the potential postsynaptic long-term depression of AMPA-EPSCs induced by sustained depolarization of CA3 pyramidal cells (Lei et al., 2003Lei S. Pelkey K.A. Topolnik L. Conger P. Lacaille J.C. Mcbain C.J. Depolarization-induced long-term depression at hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9786-9795PubMed Google Scholar). In these conditions, the six bursts stimulation protocol did not induce any potentiation of the EPSCs recorded at −70 mV (Figure 5D) (which are mainly mediated by AMPA and kainate receptors in 1.3 mM extracellular Mg2+; Figure S2D). The EPSCs recorded at +30 mV displayed a considerably slower decay time after LTP induction indicating an increase of the NMDA component (Figure 5E). We further confirmed and quantified the selective potentiation of NMDA-EPSCs by recording the composite AMPA/NMDA EPSC at +30 mV after 40 min of recording in cells where LTP was induced and in control cells. In both sets of cells, the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5 was then applied and the remaining AMPA-EPSC was recorded. We then measured the NMDA/AMPA ratio at +30 mV by subtracting the AMPA-EPSC from the composite AMPA/NMDA EPSC. In control cells at +30 mV the amplitude of the NMDA-EPSCs represented on average 44% ± 7% (n = 4) of the AMPA-EPSCs (Figure S2). This ratio was significantly increased (82% ± 9%, n = 5) in cells where LTP was induced (Figure S2). These data provide clear evidence for a form of LTP that is selective for NMDA-EPSCs. Modifications of the paired-pulse ratio are commonly assumed to reflect presynaptic changes in the probability of release. In agreement, conventional presynaptic Mf LTP leads to an increase in the probability of release and concomitantly to a decrease in paired-pulse ratio (Zalutsky and Nicoll, 1990Zalutsky R.A. Nicoll R.A. Comparison of two forms of long-term potentiation in single hippocampal neurons.Science. 1990; 251: 1619-1624Crossref Scopus (617) Google Scholar). In contrast, the six bursts stimulation protocol used to trigger LTP of Mf NMDA-EPSCs did not induce any durable changes in the paired-pulse ratio (3.4 ± 0.5 in baseline versus 3.7 ± 0.6, 30–40 min after the bursts, n = 6, p = 0.4; Figures 5F and 5G). The lack of change in the paired-pulse ratio after LTP induction together with the observation that AMPA-EPSCs are not potentiated strongly suggest that this form of synaptic plas"

We report that miRNAs are required for terminal differentiation of olfactory precursors in both mouse and zebrafish but are dispensable for proper function of mature olfactory neurons. The repertoire of miRNAs expressed in olfactory tissues contains over 100 distinct miRNAs. A subset, including the miR-200 family, shows high olfactory enrichment and expression patterns consistent with a role during olfactory neurogenesis. Loss of function of the miR-200 family phenocopies the terminal differentiation defect observed in absence of all miRNA activity in olfactory progenitors. Our data support the notion that vertebrate tissue differentiation is controlled by conserved subsets of organ-specific miRNAs in both mouse and zebrafish and provide insights into control mechanisms underlying olfactory differentiation in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2069882289,"Background Remotely-sensed environmental data from earth-orbiting satellites are increasingly used to model the distribution and abundance of both plant and animal species, especially those of economic or conservation importance. Time series of data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on-board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites offer the potential to capture environmental thermal and vegetation seasonality, through temporal Fourier analysis, more accurately than was previously possible using the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor data. MODIS data are composited over 8- or 16-day time intervals that pose unique problems for temporal Fourier analysis. Applying standard techniques to MODIS data can introduce errors of up to 30% in the estimation of the amplitudes and phases of the Fourier harmonics. Methodology/Principal Findings We present a novel spline-based algorithm that overcomes the processing problems of composited MODIS data. The algorithm is tested on artificial data generated using randomly selected values of both amplitudes and phases, and provides an accurate estimate of the input variables under all conditions. The algorithm was then applied to produce layers that capture the seasonality in MODIS data for the period from 2001 to 2005. Conclusions/Significance Global temporal Fourier processed images of 1 km MODIS data for Middle Infrared Reflectance, day- and night-time Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) are presented for ecological and epidemiological applications. The finer spatial and temporal resolution, combined with the greater geolocational and spectral accuracy of the MODIS instruments, compared with previous multi-temporal data sets, mean that these data may be used with greater confidence in species' distribution modelling."
https://openalex.org/W2146605352,"Neuronal activity augments maturation of mushroom-shaped spines to form excitatory synapses, thereby strengthening synaptic transmission. We have delineated a Ca(2+)-signaling pathway downstream of the NMDA receptor that stimulates calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) and CaMKI to promote formation of spines and synapses in hippocampal neurons. CaMKK and CaMKI form a multiprotein signaling complex with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) betaPIX and GIT1 that is localized in spines. CaMKI-mediated phosphorylation of Ser516 in betaPIX enhances its GEF activity, resulting in activation of Rac1, an established enhancer of spinogenesis. Suppression of CaMKK or CaMKI by pharmacological inhibitors, dominant-negative (dn) constructs and siRNAs, as well as expression of the betaPIX Ser516Ala mutant, decreases spine formation and mEPSC frequency. Constitutively-active Pak1, a downstream effector of Rac1, rescues spine inhibition by dnCaMKI or betaPIX S516A. This activity-dependent signaling pathway can promote synapse formation during neuronal development and in structural plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2010697887,"Cutaneous wound repair regenerates skin integrity, but a chronic failure to heal results in compromised tissue function and increased morbidity. To address this, we have used an integrated approach, using nanobiotechnology to augment the rate of wound reepithelialization by combining self-assembling peptide (SAP) nanofiber scaffold and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). This SAP bioscaffold was tested in a bioengineered Human Skin Equivalent (HSE) tissue model that enabled wound reepithelialization to be monitored in a tissue that recapitulates molecular and cellular mechanisms of repair known to occur in human skin. We found that SAP underwent molecular self-assembly to form unique 3D structures that stably covered the surface of the wound, suggesting that this scaffold may serve as a viable wound dressing. We measured the rates of release of EGF from the SAP scaffold and determined that EGF was only released when the scaffold was in direct contact with the HSE. By measuring the length of the epithelial tongue during wound reepithelialization, we found that SAP scaffolds containing EGF accelerated the rate of wound coverage by 5 fold when compared to controls without scaffolds and by 3.5 fold when compared to the scaffold without EGF. In conclusion, our experiments demonstrated that biomaterials composed of a biofunctionalized peptidic scaffold have many properties that are well-suited for the treatment of cutaneous wounds including wound coverage, functionalization with bioactive molecules, localized growth factor release and activation of wound repair."

https://openalex.org/W2164086851,"Background HLA class-I alleles differ in their ability to control HIV replication through cell-mediated immune responses. No consistent associations have been found between the breadth of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) responses and the control of HIV-1, and it is unknown whether the size or distribution of the viral proteome-wide epitope repertoire, i.e., the intrinsic ability to present fewer, more or specific viral epitopes, could affect clinical markers of disease progression. Methodology/Principal Findings We used an epitope prediction model to identify all epitope motifs in a set of 302 HIV-1 full-length proteomes according to each individual's HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) genotype. The epitope repertoire, i.e., the number of predicted epitopes per HIV-1 proteome, varied considerably between HLA alleles and thus among individual proteomes. In a subgroup of 270 chronically infected individuals, we found that lower viral loads and higher CD4 counts were associated with a larger predicted epitope repertoire. Additionally, in Gag and Rev only, more epitopes were restricted by alleles associated with low viral loads than by alleles associated with higher viral loads. Conclusions/Significance This comprehensive analysis puts forth the epitope repertoire as a mechanistic component of the multi-faceted HIV-specific CTL response. The favorable impact on markers of disease status of the propensity to present more HLA binding peptides and specific proteins gives impetus to vaccine design strategies that seek to elicit responses to a broad array of HIV-1 epitopes, and suggest a particular focus on Gag."
https://openalex.org/W2041365263,"Most HIV-1 transmission in Africa occurs among HIV-1-discordant couples (one partner HIV-1 infected and one uninfected) who are unaware of their discordant HIV-1 serostatus. Given the high HIV-1 incidence among HIV-1 discordant couples and to assess efficacy of interventions for reducing HIV-1 transmission, HIV-1 discordant couples represent a critical target population for HIV-1 prevention interventions and prevention trials. Substantial regional differences exist in HIV-1 prevalence in Africa, but regional differences in HIV-1 discordance among African couples, has not previously been reported.The Partners in Prevention HSV-2/HIV-1 Transmission Trial (""Partners HSV-2 Study""), the first large HIV-1 prevention trial in Africa involving HIV-1 discordant couples, completed enrollment in May 2007. Partners HSV-2 Study recruitment data from 12 sites from East and Southern Africa were used to assess HIV-1 discordance among couples accessing couples HIV-1 counseling and testing, and to correlate with enrollment of HIV-1 discordant couples. HIV-1 discordance at Partners HSV-2 Study sites ranged from 8-31% of couples tested from the community. Across all study sites and, among all couples with one HIV-1 infected partner, almost half (49%) of couples were HIV-1 discordant. Site-specific monthly enrollment of HIV-1 discordant couples into the clinical trial was not directly associated with prevalence of HIV-1 discordance, but was modestly correlated with national HIV-1 counseling and testing rates and access to palliative care/basic health care (r = 0.74, p = 0.09).HIV-1 discordant couples are a critical target for HIV-1 prevention in Africa. In addition to community prevalence of HIV-1 discordance, national infrastructure for HIV-1 testing and healthcare delivery and effective community outreach strategies impact recruitment of HIV-1 discordant couples into HIV-1 prevention trials."
https://openalex.org/W2168803129,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a translated CAG repeat in the N terminus of the huntingtin (htt) protein. Here we describe the generation and characterization of a full-length HD Drosophila model to reveal a previously unknown disease mechanism that occurs early in the course of pathogenesis, before expanded htt is imported into the nucleus in detectable amounts. We find that expanded full-length htt (128Qhtt(FL)) leads to behavioral, neurodegenerative, and electrophysiological phenotypes. These phenotypes are caused by a Ca2+-dependent increase in neurotransmitter release efficiency in 128Qhtt(FL) animals. Partial loss of function in synaptic transmission (syntaxin, Snap, Rop) and voltage-gated Ca2+ channel genes suppresses both the electrophysiological and the neurodegenerative phenotypes. Thus, our data indicate that increased neurotransmission is at the root of neuronal degeneration caused by expanded full-length htt during early stages of pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2046134697,"In addition to the classical, center/surround receptive field of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), there is an extraclassical, nonlinear surround that can strongly suppress LGN responses. This form of suppression likely plays an important role in adjusting the gain of LGN responses to visual stimuli. We performed experiments in alert and anesthetized macaque monkeys to quantify extraclassical suppression in the LGN and determine the roles of feedforward and feedback pathways in the generation of LGN suppression. Results show that suppression is significantly stronger among magnocellular neurons than parvocellular neurons and that suppression arises too quickly for involvement from cortical feedback. Furthermore, the amount of suppression supplied by the retina is not significantly different from that in the LGN. These results indicate that extraclassical suppression in the macaque LGN relies on feedforward mechanisms and suggest that suppression in the cortex likely includes a component established in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2075957585,"The mossy fiber to CA3 pyramidal cell synapse (mf-CA3) provides a major source of excitation to the hippocampus. Thus far, these glutamatergic synapses are well recognized for showing a presynaptic, NMDA receptor-independent form of LTP that is expressed as a long-lasting increase of transmitter release. Here, we show that in addition to this ""classical"" LTP, mf-CA3 synapses can undergo a form of LTP characterized by a selective enhancement of NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. This potentiation requires coactivation of NMDA and mGlu5 receptors and a postsynaptic calcium rise. Unlike classical LTP, expression of this mossy fiber LTP is due to a PKC-dependent recruitment of NMDA receptors specifically to the mf-CA3 synapse via a SNARE-dependent process. Having two mechanistically different forms of LTP may allow mf-CA3 synapses to respond with more flexibility to the changing demands of the hippocampal network."
https://openalex.org/W1969298446,"Ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) subunits contain a large N-terminal domain (NTD) that precedes the agonist-binding domain (ABD) and participates in subunit oligomerization. In NMDA receptors (NMDARs), the NTDs of NR2A and NR2B subunits also form binding sites for the endogenous inhibitor Zn2+ ion. Although these allosteric sites have been characterized in detail, the molecular mechanisms by which the NTDs communicate with the rest of the receptor to promote its inhibition remain unknown. Here, we identify the ABD dimer interface as a major structural determinant that permits coupling between the NTDs and the channel gate. The strength of this interface also controls proton inhibition, another form of allosteric modulation of NMDARs. Conformational rearrangements at the ABD dimer interface thus appear to be a key mechanism conserved in all iGluR subfamilies, but have evolved to fulfill different functions: fast desensitization at AMPA and kainate receptors, allosteric inhibition at NMDARs."

Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer in living HEK293 cells, we demonstrate that mGlu5a and NMDA receptor clustering reflects the existence of direct physical interactions. Consequently, the mGlu5a receptor decreased NMDA receptor current, and reciprocally, the NMDA receptor strongly reduced the ability of the mGlu5a receptor to release intracellular calcium. We show that deletion of the C terminus of the mGlu5a receptor abolished both its interaction with the NMDA receptor and reciprocal inhibition of the receptors.

Because both NMDA and mGlu receptors are important players in synaptic transmission, there has been considerable interest in identifying the mechanisms underlying the functional interactions between these two classes of glutamate receptors. In this work, using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), we identified direct physical interaction between the mGlu5a and NMDA (NR1/NR2B) receptors, which supports mutual functional constitutive inhibition of the receptors.

The plasmids encoding the NR1A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor (pRcCMVaa-NR1A and p3apA-ϵ2-NR2B) were a generous gift from J. Neyton. For BRET experiments, a flexible linker (SGGGGS) was added in-frame to the 5′-end coding sequence of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and luciferase in the pcDNA3.1-YFP and phRluc plasmids. The entire coding regions of Myc-mGlu5a (or HA-mGlu1a or Myc-mGlu7a) and NR1A were then subcloned into pcDNA3.1-YFP and phRluc to obtain pcDNA3.1-Myc-mGlu5a-YFP and pNR1A-hRluc, respectively. For cell-surface immunolabeling and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments in transfected HEK293 cells, the coding region of NR1A-hRluc was subcloned into pGFP2-C3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in-frame with the 3′-end of GFP2 to obtain pGFP2-NR1A-hRluc, which codes for the NR1A-hRluc subunit tagged in its extracellular part with GFP2. The mGlu5 mutant pcDNA3.1-Myc-mGlu5a-i1YFP was generated by inserting the enzyme restriction sites MluI and NotI after the first transmembrane domain and introducing the YFP tag (amplified by PCR) in-frame before the first intracellular loop. The mutant obtained, Myc-mGlu5a-i1YFP, displays the YFP tag (framed by two SGGGGS linkers) inserted between Tyr581 and Arg582. To obtain the pcDNA3.1-Myc-mGlu5a-DelCtail-YFP mutant, we amplified the Myc-mGlu5a receptor without its C-terminal tail (until the sequence GKSVT at position 861) between the restriction sites SpeI and AgeI by PCR. The mGlu5a-DelCtail PCR fragment was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1-YFP.

For transfection experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and cultured for 24 h.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was renewed, and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. Immunolabeling in Non-permeabilized HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and incubated in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin). HEK293 cells were incubated with rabbit IgG anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes) or mouse IgG anti-Myc epitope antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer for 30 min. Cells were then washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes) for 30 min in the dark. After extensive washing, the coverslips were mounted for immunolabeling analyses using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with a Plan-Apo 63× 1.40 numerical aperture oil immersion lens.

The lysate obtained from 107 cells and 5 μg of goat anti-Myc antibody incubated for 1 h at room temperature were co-immunoprecipitated using solubilized Sepharose-protein A (Sigma) in lysis buffer. After extensive washing, the solid phase was incubated in Laemmli buffer at 90 °C. A control assay was performed under the same conditions but without anti-Myc antibody. Western Blot Analyses—Protein samples were resolved by 7.5% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblotting using mouse anti-NR1 antibody (1:500; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The nitrocellulose was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min and developed using the Renaissance chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Intracellular Calcium Measurements—After transfection, HK293 cells were seeded in polyornithine-coated, black-walled, clear bottom 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h. Cells were then washed with freshly prepared buffer and loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester (1 μm; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with 50 μl of buffer. A drug plate was prepared with the various concentrations of agonist to be tested, and 50 μl of 2× drug solution was added to each well after 20 s of control recording. Fluorescence signals (excitation at 485 nm and emission at 525 nm) were measured using a FlexStation fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at sampling intervals of 1.5 s for 60 s. Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells cotransfected with the transfection marker GFP and the plasmids of interest were selected based on their fluorescence for whole-cell patch-clamp recording at room temperature. The recording pipettes had resistances of 3–5 megaohms when filled with the following medium: 140 mm CsCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm d-glucose, pH 7.2 (osmolarity of 300 mosm). Cells were continuously perfused with the following external medium: 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm d-glucose, 0.01 mm glycine, and 0.0003 mm tetrodotoxin, pH 7.4 (osmolarity of 330 mosm). The NMDA receptor currents were recorded through an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and filtered at 1 kHz. The data were then digitized at 3 kHz, and maximal current amplitude was measured using pCLAMP 9 software (Molecular Devices). Agonists were applied using a fast gravity perfusion system. BRET—Cells were counted by measuring protein concentration (DC protein assay kit, Bio-Rad). For total fluorescence and luminescence measurements, cells were dispersed in 96-well plates with clear bottoms (Costar) at a density of 100,000 cells/well. We measured the total fluorescence of the cells in a Mithras LB 940 instrument (Berthold Technologies) using an excitation filter at 485 nm and an emission filter at 530 nm. The light emitted at 530 nm upon light excitation at 485 nm (fluorescence) is indicative of the amount of YFP-tagged proteins. We then incubated cells with DeepBlue C coelenterazine (5 μm) to measure the total luminescence using the Mithras instrument. The light emitted at 400 nm in the presence of DeepBlue C (luminescence) is indicative of the amount of Rluc-tagged proteins. For BRET measurements, cells coexpressing NR1A-Rluc + NR2B and mGlu5a-YFP constructs were distributed in white 96-well microplates (Corning) at a density of 100,000 cells/well. We initiated BRET by adding 5 μm coelenterazine H and measured the ratio of the light emitted by YFP (510–550 nm) to the light emitted by Rluc (460–500 nm) using the Mithras instrument. Values were corrected by subtracting the background ratio detected when the Rluc construct was expressed alone. Quantification of Cell-surface Receptor Expression Using Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Cells expressing Myc-mGlu5a and/or GFP-NR1A + NR2B were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and then blocked with phosphate-buffered saline plus 5% fetal bovine serum. After a 30-min reaction with one of the primary antibodies (rabbit IgG anti-GFP antibody (1:1000) or mouse IgG anti-Myc antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes)) in the same buffer, goat anti-rabbit (or anti-mouse) antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was applied for 30 min. Secondary antibody was detected and instantaneously quantified by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Femto, Pierce) using a Wallac VICTOR2 luminescence counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Statistical Analyses—Statistical significance of the mean value differences was determined using Student's t test analysis, with a p value of 0.05. Direct Interaction between NMDA and Group I mGlu Receptors—In an attempt to detect direct interaction between the mGlu5a and NMDA receptors, human NR1A and mGlu5a cDNAs were fused at their C termini to the energy donor Rluc and acceptor YFP, respectively (GFP2-NR1A-Rluc and Myc-mGlu5a-YFP) for BRET measurements. We verified the correct cell-surface expression of the tagged proteins (Myc-mGlu5a-YFP and GFP2-NR1A-Rluc) using antibodies raised against their extracellular tags (anti-Myc and anti-GFP2, respectively). Immunolabeling of non-permeabilized HEK293 cells transfected with Myc-mGlu5a-YFP or GFP2-NR1A-Rluc and NR2B revealed that both fusion proteins were present at the cell surface (supplemental Fig. S1A). Moreover, both constructs were functional when transfected in HEK293 cells. NMDA-induced currents were not significantly different in HEK293 cells cotransfected with wild-type NR1A and NR2B compared with cells coexpressing NR1A-Rluc and NR2B (supplemental Fig. S1B), and stimulation of recombinant mGlu5a receptor or mGlu5a-YFP induced similar intracellular Ca2+ release (supplemental Fig. S1C). Having these tagged receptors functionally expressed, we studied the energy transfer between Rluc and YFP in cells coexpressing NR1A-Rluc, NR2B, and Myc-mGlu5a-YFP receptors using the membrane-permeable luciferase substrate coelenterazine H. Hydrolysis of coelenterazine H leads to the emission of light with a spectrum overlapping the excitation spectrum of YFP, thus allowing BRET. At a constant level of NR1A-Rluc + NR2B expression, the BRET signal increased hyperbolically as a function of the mGlu5a-YFP expression level (Fig. 1A), indicating a specific interaction between the two proteins (21Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at a constant donor/acceptor ratio (fluorescence/luminescence = 0.104 ± 0.015), the BRET signal remained constant whatever the total level of receptor expression (Fig. 1B). This demonstrated that the interaction between the NMDA and mGlu5 receptors was not just a phenomenon of highly overexpressed proteins. To confirm that the signal specifically reflects the interaction process, experiments were performed in the absence of the NR2B subunit, which precluded membrane targeting of the NR1A-Rluc subunit (22McIlhinney R.A. Bourdelles Le B. Molnar E. Tricaud N. Streit P. Whiting P.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This led to dramatically weaker energy transfer with mGlu5a-YFP. Moreover the BRET signal increased linearly (rather than hyperbolically) with mGlu5-YFP expression, which most likely reflected random collision (bystander BRET) (Fig. 1A). To confirm the interaction between the mGlu5a and NMDA receptors, we co-immunoprecipitated Myc-mGlu5a-YFP with the NR1A-Rluc receptor subunit in HEK293 cells cotransfected with these proteins and NR2B (Fig. 1C). Taken together, the results demonstrated that the measured energy transfer between NR1A-Rluc + NR2B and Myc-mGlu5a-YFP resulted from close interaction, rather than from a nonrandom clustering of these two proteins. To further investigate the specificity of the receptor interactions, we monitored the energy transfer between the NMDA receptor and the cognate mGlu5a receptor, mGlu1a. The mGlu1a receptor was tagged with HA in its extracellular domain and with YFP in the C-terminal intracellular part (see “Experimental Procedures”). At a constant level of NR1A-Rluc + NR2B expression, the BRET signal increased hyperbolically as a function of HA-mGlu1a-YFP expression, indicating a specific interaction between the NMDA and mGlu1a receptors. Thus, both group I mGlu receptors (mGlu5 and mGlu1a) could interact with the NMDA receptor. In contrast, the weak and linear BRET signal obtained between NR1A-Rluc + NR2B and increasing concentrations of the group III Myc-mGlu7a-YFP receptor did not reflect specific interaction between the tagged partners, but rather random collisions (Fig. 1D). This observation is indicative of the specificity of the interaction between the NMDA receptor and group I over group III mGlu receptors. Agonist-induced BRET Modulations between NR1A-Rluc and mGlu5a-YFP—We then studied whether the interaction between the NMDA and mGlu5a receptors was modulated by activation of the receptor complex using BRET measurement between NR1A-Rluc + NR2B and mGlu5a-YFP proteins. A 10-s application of either the selective mGlu5a receptor agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG; 100 μm) or NMDA (100 μm) significantly increased the BRET signal (Fig. 2A). The increase was transient (Fig. 2B) and dose-dependent, with half-maximal responses (EC50) at 6.7 μm for DHPG and 0.4 μm for NMDA. These EC50 values are consistent with the affinity of the ligands for their receptors. The increase in BRET signal likely attested to a conformational change in the activated receptors upon agonist binding. In contrast, the protein level that was required to reach the BRET50 value (50% of NR1A-Rluc linked to mGlu5a-YFP) was not significantly changed in the presence of agonists (fluorescence/luminescence ratios to obtain BRET50: 0.02817 ± 0.00879 under basal conditions, 0.02354 ± 0.00694 in the presence of NMDA, and 0.02404 ± 0.00641 in the presence of DHPG) (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the affinity of the interaction between the mGlu5a and NMDA receptors was independent of agonist binding. None of the receptor ligands altered the bystander BRET observed in the absence of the NR2B subunit (data not shown), confirming the selectivity of the agonist effect on the functional mGlu-NMDA receptor complex. Reciprocal Receptor Cross-talk—The spontaneous interaction between the NMDA and mGlu5a receptors and its regulation by agonists suggested the existence of a relevant functional interaction between the receptors. As shown in Fig. 3A, HEK293 cells cotransfected with the NR1A and NR2B subunits displayed NMDA-induced current. Interestingly, coexpression of the mGlu5a receptor strongly reduced this current in the absence of DHPG. These results indicate an agonist-independent/constitutive inhibition of the NMDA receptor by the mGlu5a receptor. Moreover, no additional effect was obtained by co-stimulation of the mGlu5a receptor with DHPG (Fig. 3A). Reciprocally, when expressed alone in HEK293 cells, the stimulated mGlu5a receptor (100 μm DHPG) induced a marked intracellular Ca2+ release, which was significantly reduced when the NMDA receptor (NR1A + NR2B) was coexpressed (Fig. 3B). Again, concomitant application of NMDA did not significantly affect the DHPG response. Thus, the NMDA receptor constitutively inhibited the mGlu5a receptor. Notably, the total amount of receptors (estimated by the fluorescence emitted by GFP2-NR1A and the luminescence of Myc-mGlu5a-Rluc) was not significantly different when those receptors were expressed alone or together. We subsequently verified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements that the cell-surface expression of the receptors was not affected by their cotransfection (Fig. 3C). The results indicate a reciprocal and constitutive inhibition between the NMDA and mGlu5a receptors. This mutual regulation probably resulted from a direct steric blockade of the co-assembled receptors. Indeed, the effect was observed in the absence of agonist, and the presence of agonist did not potentiate the effect. Moreover, the mGlu5a receptor did not spontaneously induce intracellular Ca2+ release (compare the calcium release obtained in the absence of agonist in untransfected (mock) and Myc-mGlu5a-transfected cells) (Fig. 3B), although it constitutively blocked NMDA receptor currents (Fig. 3A). To further test the hypothesis of a G-protein-independent blockade between the mGlu5a and NMDA receptors, we generated a mGlu5a receptor tagged with YFP within the first intracellular loop. The so-called Myc-mGlu5a-i1YFP receptor was successfully expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 4A). However, this construct was unable to activate G-protein (Fig. 4B). Despite the lack of G-protein activation, the BRET signal increased hyperbolically as a function of the mGlu5a-i1YFP expression level at a constant level of NR1A-Rluc + NR2B expression (Fig. 4C). This reflected a specific interaction between the two proteins. Furthermore, the mGlu5a-i1YFP construct was still able to inhibit the NMDA receptor currents in the absence of agonist (Fig. 4D). It is therefore likely that the constitutive regulation of the NMDA receptor by the mGlu5a receptor was independent of the conventional mGlu5 receptor activity and intracellular signaling pathway. Loss of Physical Interaction Results in Loss of Reciprocal Modulation between the mGlu5a and NMDA Receptors—We further studied whether the direct physical interaction between the receptors could underlie their reciprocal modulation. We generated a mGlu5a-YFP mutant deleted of its C-terminal tail. This mutant was no longer able to physically interact with the functional NMDA receptor (NR1A-Rluc + NR2B) as assessed by loss of the BRET signal in cotransfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A) and the absence of co-immunoprecipitation (supplemental Fig. S2). It was also unable to spontaneously inhibit NMDA currents (Fig. 5B) and was not constitutively modulated by the NMDA receptor (Fig. 5C), although it was still expressed at the cell surface data (not shown) and correctly coupled to intracellular Ca2+ stores (Fig. 5C). These results demonstrate that the reciprocal and constitutive inhibition of the mGlu5a and NMDA receptors is entirely dependent on their physical interaction. This further supports the hypothesis of a mutual steric effect between the co-assembled mGlu5a and NMDA receptors. In addition, the C-terminal tail of the group I mGlu receptor fused to the lymphocyte transmembrane protein CD4 was sufficient for co-immunoprecipitation with the NMDA receptor (supplemental Fig. S3). More precisely, progressive deletions of the CD4-mGlu1 C-terminal tail indicated the distal 108 last amino acids to be necessary for interaction with the NMDA receptor (supplemental Fig. S3). However, the CD4-mGlu1 C-terminal tail failed to modulate by itself the function of NMDA receptors (data not shown). In this study, we have reported that the mGlu5a and NMDA receptors can physically interact together and undergo a reciprocal constitutive inhibition. To study the occurrence and dynamics of this protein-protein interaction, we used the BRET technology in living cells. In this assay, the efficacy of the energy transfer depends on the close proximity (<10 nm) and orientation of the donor and acceptor entities (23Tsien R.Y. Bacskai B.J. Adams S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 242-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). With the average radius of proteins being 50 Å, the occurrence of resonance energy transfer is interpreted as a strong indication that the proteins attached to the energy donors and acceptors, respectively, are indeed in direct contact. Our data thus provide evidence of a direct interaction between the mGlu5a and NMDA receptors. Although BRET measurements were performed between the mGlu5a and NR1A subunits, our data do not allow us to conclude whether the interaction occurred between mGlu5a and the NR1A or NR2B subunit of functional NMDA receptors. Our study also clearly demonstrates that the interaction allowed reciprocal modulation of the mGlu5a and NMDA receptors. Concomitant expression of both receptors induced a basal mutual functional inhibition without affecting cell-surface receptor expression. Combined with the lack of agonist-promoted functional regulations, these results suggest that the mutual regulation is an agonist-independent/constitutive regulation. This reciprocal cross-talk between the mGlu5a and NMDA receptors indicates a non-canonical mechanism of action. The mGlu5a receptor did not display constitutive activity with respect to its intracellular calcium signaling, but this lack of classical G-protein pathway activation did not prevent the constitutive inhibition of NMDA receptor currents. Moreover, the mGlu5a receptor mutant mGlu5a-i1YFP, which was defective in G-protein activation and displayed perfect interaction with the NMDA receptor, still inhibited NMDA currents in a constitutive manner. This definitively excluded a possible involvement of the conventional G-protein pathway in this effect. Furthermore, a truncated mGlu5a receptor construct lacking the entire C-terminal domain (mGlu5a-DelCtail-YFP) efficiently coupled to G-protein activation but was unable to promote the BRET signal with the NMDA receptor and totally lost its ability to inhibit NMDA currents. The loss of BRET was certainly attributable to the suppression of a direct physical interaction between the two receptors, rather than an increase in donor and acceptor tag distance, because the YFP tag in the mGlu5a-DelCtail-YFP mutant was positioned under the membrane cell surface, as was the case for the mGlu5a-i1YFP construct, which still displayed a BRET signal with the interacting NR1A-Rluc subunit. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the physical interaction between the NMDA and mGlu5a receptors was responsible for their mutual functional regulation. We found that the other group I mGlu receptor, mGlu1a-YFP, could also interact with the NMDA receptor, whereas mGlu7a-YFP (group III) could not. This specificity of interaction with the NMDA receptor was in harmony with the endogenous subcellular location of these receptors. Indeed, group I mGlu receptors as postsynaptic entities are neighbors of the NMDA receptor, whereas mGlu7a receptors are confined to the presynaptic compartment. Previous reports have already emphasized functional modulations between group I mGlu and NMDA receptors. However, this work highlights mutual antagonism, whereas synergism is often observed in neurons of various brain regions (9Aniksztejn L. Otani S. Ben-Ari Y. Eur. J.

Our report describing mutual inhibition between the mGlu5a and NMDA receptors therefore exacerbates the controversy regarding the role of mGlu receptors in the modulation of NMDA receptor functions (14Kotecha S.A.

Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Group I mGlu receptors have been reported to both potentiate and paradoxically depress excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (26Bortolotto Z.A. Fitzjohn S.M. Collingridge G.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Furthermore, co-activation of the NMDA and mGlu5 receptors results in a profound enhancement of NMDA receptor currents and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. If, however, the mGlu5 receptor is activated in the absence of NMDA receptor stimulation, the resulting activity of the NMDA receptor and the miniature excitatory postsynaptic current display a modest depression (14Kotecha S.A.

This apparent discrepancy may rely on the physical association of NMDA receptors with mGlu receptors probably via the Homer-Shank complex (27Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). The direct association and mutual antagonism of the two receptors that we describe here might be precluded in neurons by the binding of scaffolding proteins to the C termini of the receptors (Homer-Shank on the mGlu5 receptor and guanylate kinase-associated protein-PSD95 on the NMDA receptor). Nevertheless, such multiprotein receptor complexes are certainly not immutable, and the receptor-protein interactions may rather undergo regulated association/dissociation features depending on the physiological conditions. For example, Homer1a is a short splice variant of Homer1b/c that lacks the ability to link mGlu1a/5 receptors to other postsynaptic proteins, including Shank, and thus disassembles the synaptic glutamate receptor signaling complex (28Ehrengruber M.U. Kato A. Inokuchi K. Hennou S. Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 29: 213-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Fagni L. Chavis P. Ango F. Bockaert J.

Worley P.F. Cell. 2003; 114: 777-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Homer1a expression is regulated by neuronal activity. When the multiprotein postsynaptic receptor complex is disrupted by Homer1a, the mGlu1a/5 and NMDA receptors may become free to directly interact in neurons and undergo reciprocal constitutive inhibition. Such an activity-dependent regulation of mGlu1a/5a and NMDA receptor function may explain the dual role of group I mGlu receptors in modulation of NMDA receptors that has been described in the literature. A recent report emphasizes the importance of the C-terminal tail of group I mGlu receptors in attenuation of NMDA-induced neurotoxicity (34Xu W. Wong T.P. Chery N. Gaertner T. Wang Y.T. Baudry M. Neuron. 2007; 53: 399-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This neuroprotective effect is independent of G-protein activation and is removed following NMDA receptor activation through a calpain-mediated truncation of the mGlu receptor C-terminal tail. Our findings may contribute to a better understanding of this effect. It is generally accepted that activation of metabotropic receptors engages one or more intracellular signaling cascades that control the function and/or localization of a cohort of ligand-gated ion channels. Conversely, stimulating ionotropic receptors can indirectly affect metabotropic signaling cascades. Our results show that metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors can reciprocally modulate each other via more direct interaction, thus contrasting with this consensual paradigm. Such an emerging theme of direct interaction between structurally unrelated membrane receptors is indeed reinforced by the discoveries of other receptor couples: D5-GABAA (35Liu F. Wan Q. Pristupa Z.B. Yu X.M. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Nature. 2000; 403: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), D1-NMDA (36Fiorentini C. Gardoni F. Spano P. Luca Di M. Missale C. J. Biol.

Together, these studies illuminate a previously unappreciated richness in the functional interactions between transmembrane receptor proteins. This type of direct interaction could impart a much higher degree of target-effector specificity, timing, and subcellular signaling than could ever be envisaged with the mass effects expected from activating second messenger cascades.

https://openalex.org/W2071117570,"The evolution of the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) epidemic is hazardous to predict due to uncertainty in ascertaining the prevalence of infection and because the disease might remain asymptomatic or produce an alternate, sporadic-like phenotype.Transgenic mice were produced that overexpress human prion protein with methionine at codon 129, the only allele found so far in vCJD-affected patients. These mice were infected with prions derived from variant and sporadic CJD (sCJD) cases by intracerebral or intraperitoneal route, and transmission efficiency and strain phenotype were analyzed in brain and spleen. We showed that i) the main features of vCJD infection in humans, including a prominent involvement of the lymphoid tissues compared to that in sCJD infection were faithfully reproduced in such mice; ii) transmission of vCJD agent by intracerebral route could lead to the propagation of either vCJD or sCJD-like prion in the brain, whereas vCJD prion was invariably propagated in the spleen, iii) after peripheral exposure, inefficient neuroinvasion was observed, resulting in an asymptomatic infection with life-long persistence of vCJD prion in the spleen at stable and elevated levels.Our findings emphasize the possibility that human-to-human transmission of vCJD might produce alternative neuropathological phenotypes and that lymphoid tissue examination of CJD cases classified as sporadic might reveal an infection by vCJD-type prions. They also provide evidence for the strong propensity of this agent to establish long-lasting, subclinical vCJD infection of lymphoreticular tissues, thus amplifying the risk for iatrogenic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1995427942,"Background The human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes produces an endoglycosidase, EndoS that hydrolyzes the chitobiose core of the asparagine-linked glycan on the heavy chain of human IgG. IgG-binding to Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) on leukocytes triggers effector functions including phagocytosis, oxidative burst and the release of inflammatory mediators. The interactions between FcγR and the Fc domain of IgG depend on the IgG glycosylation state. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show for the first time that EndoS hydrolyzes the heavy chain glycan of all four human IgG subclasses (IgG1-4), in purified form and in a plasma environment. An inactive form of EndoS, obtained by site-directed mutagenesis, binds IgG with high affinity, in contrast to wild type EndoS that only transiently interacts with IgG, as shown by Slot-blotting and surface plasmon resonance technology. Furthermore, EndoS hydrolysis of the IgG glycan influences the binding of IgG to immobilized soluble FcγR and to an erythroleukemic cell line, K562, expressing FcγRIIa. Incubation of whole blood with EndoS results in a dramatic decrease of IgG binding to activated monocytes as analyzed by flow cytometry. Moreover, the IgG bound to K562 cells dissociates when cells are treated with EndoS. Likewise, IgG bound to immobilized FcγRIIa and subsequently treated with EndoS, dissociates from the receptor as analyzed by surface plasmon resonance and Western blot. Conclusions/Significance We provide novel information about bacterial enzymatic modulation of the IgG/FcγR interaction that emphasizes the importance of glycosylation for antibody effector functions. Moreover, EndoS could be used as a biochemical tool for specific IgG N-glycan hydrolysis and IgG purification/detection, or as a potential immunosuppressing agent for treatment of antibody-mediated pathological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2172269037,"Two groups of participants, one susceptible to posthypnotic amnesia (PHA) and the other not, viewed a movie. A week later, they underwent hypnosis in the fMRI scanner and received a suggestion to forget the movie details after hypnosis until receiving a reversal cue. The participants were tested twice for memory for the movie and for the context in which it was shown, under the posthypnotic suggestion and after its reversal, while their brain was scanned. The PHA group showed reduced memory for movie but not for context while under suggestion. Activity in occipital, temporal, and prefrontal areas differed among the groups, and, in the PHA group, between suggestion and reversal conditions. We propose that whereas some of these regions subserve retrieval of long-term episodic memory, others are involved in inhibiting retrieval, possibly already in a preretrieval monitoring stage. Similar mechanisms may also underlie other forms of functional amnesia."

Transfection of WT mouse cardiac fibroblasts with AAV/TGFβ ACT1 markedly enhanced the expression of NADPH oxidases (p22phox, p47phox, and gp91phox subunits) and LOX-1, formation of reactive oxygen species, and collagen synthesis, concomitant with an increase in the activation of p38 and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). The TGFβ1-mediated increase in collagen synthesis was markedly attenuated in the LOX-1 knock-out mouse cardiac fibroblasts as well as in WT mouse cardiac fibroblasts treated with a specific anti-LOX-1 antibody. Treatment with anti-LOX-1 antibody also reduced NADPH oxidase expression and MAPK activation. The NADPH oxidase inhibitors and gp91phox small interfering RNA reduced LOX-1 expression, MAPK activation, and collagen formation. The p38 MAPK inhibitors as well as the p44/42 MAPK inhibitors reduced collagen formation without affecting LOX-1 expression in cardiac fibroblasts. These observations suggest that collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts involves a facilitative interaction between TGFβ1-NADPH oxidase and LOX-1. Further, the activation of MAPK pathway appears to be downstream of TGFβ1-reactive oxygen species-LOX-1 cascade. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) activation leads to tissue fibrosis. Here, we report on the role of LOX-1, a lectin-like 52-kDa receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein, in TGFβ1-mediated collagen expression and underlying signaling in mouse cardiac fibroblasts. TGFβ1 was overexpressed in wild-type (WT) and LOX-1 knock-out mouse cardiac fibroblasts by transfection with adeno-associated virus type 2 vector carrying the active TGFβ1 moiety (AAV/TGFβ ACT1).

Further, the activation of MAPK pathway appears to be downstream of TGFβ1-reactive oxygen species-LOX-1 cascade. Cardiac fibrosis, characterized by accumulation of matrix proteins in the extracellular space in the perivascular region, is closely associated with the development of heart failure. Among the extracellular matrix proteins, up to 85% are collagens, of which type 1 (collagen I) and type 3 (collagen III) constitute two-thirds of total collagens in most tissues (1Heeneman S. Cleutjens J.P. Faber B.C. Creemers E.E. van Suylen R.J. Lutgens E. Cleutjens K.B. Daemen M.J. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor (TGF) 3The abbreviations used are: TGF, transforming growth factor; rTGF, recombinant TGF; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WT, wild-type; KO, knock-out; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DCF, dihydrofluorescein. β1 is one of the most pleiotropic and multifunctional peptides known (2Mehta J.L. Attramadal H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 74: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It exerts potent effects on many different cell types and is involved in a wide variety of biological processes (2Mehta J.L. Attramadal H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 74: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The cellular actions of TGFβ1 are dependent not only on the cell type but also on its state of differentiation and the cytokine milieu (3Letterio J.J. Roberts A.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence that TGFβ1 stimulates fibroblast growth, enhances collagen synthesis, and suppresses collagen degradation (2Mehta J.L. Attramadal H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 74: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the specific effect of TGFβ1 on the cardiac remodeling process remains unclear. TGFβ1 is synthesized in cells as a precursor molecule, TGFβ Latent1. Conversion from cysteine (Cys223/225) into serine (Ser223/225) in the TGFβ Latent1 molecule is associated with the formation of TGFβ ACT1 (active TGFβ1) (4Blobe G. Schiemann W. Lodish H. N. Eng. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). It is the TGFβ ACT1 that appears to be functionally relevant in the process of ischemia-reperfusion (5Yang B.C. Zander D. Mehta J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 733-738PubMed Google Scholar). LOX-1 is a lectin-like receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein (6Mehta J.L. Chen J. Hermonat P.L. Romeo F. Novelli G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). It is also up-regulated in response to oxidative stress (7Hu C.P. Dandapat A. Chen J. Fujita Y. Inoue N. Kawase Y. Jishage K.I. Suzuki H. Sawamura T. Mehta J.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 76: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Activation of LOX-1 enhances the growth of cardiac fibroblasts and promotes collagen synthesis (8Chen K. Chen J. Liu Y. Xie J. Li D. Sawamura T. Hermonat P.L. Mehta J.L. Hypertension. 2005; 46: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Joseph J. Ranganathan S. Mehta J.L. J. Cardiovas. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 8: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It has been reported that TGFβ1 can regulate LOX-1 expression in vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and monocytes/macrophages (10Draude G. Lorenz R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1042-H1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Minami M. Kume N. Kataoka H. Morimoto M. Hayashida K. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Kita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Another study showed that LOX-1 blockade reduces TGFβ1 protein expression in endothelial cells (12Chen H. Li D. Saldeen T. Mehta J.L. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The present study was conducted to examine whether and how LOX-1 mediates TGFβ1-mediated collagen production. Materials and Reagents—Monoclonal antibody against mouse LOX-1 raised in rat with mouse Fc portion of IgG has been reported earlier to block the effect of LOX-1 (13Mehta J.L. Sanada N. Hu C.P. Chen J. Dandapat A. Sugawara F. Satoh H. Inoue K. Kawase Y. Jishage K. Suzuki H. Takeya M. Schnackenberg L. Beger R. Hermonat P.L. Thomas M. Sawamura T. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1634-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The following reagents and antibodies were purchased: p38 MAPK inhibitors SB203580 (Sigma) and SB202190 (Calbiochem); p44/42 MAPK inhibitors U0126 (Sigma) and PD98059 (Calbiochem); NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin (Aldrich) and diphenyliodonium (Sigma); GeneSilencer® siRNA transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems); siCONTROL® non-targeting siRNA and siGENOME SMARTpool® NADPH oxidase gp91phox subunit siRNA (Dharmacon); human recombinant TGFβ1 (rTGFβ1) and mouse nonspecific IgG (Sigma); all primary antibodies for Western blot analysis except anti-LOX-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was purchased from Cayman. U0126, PD98059, SB203580, SB202190, diphenyliodonium, and apocynin were dissolved in Me2SO. The final concentration of Me2SO was <0.1% in these experiments. Animals—C57BL/6 mice (also referred to as WT mice) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. The homozygous LOX-1 knock-out (KO) mice were developed as described recently (13Mehta J.L. Sanada N. Hu C.P. Chen J. Dandapat A. Sugawara F. Satoh H. Inoue K. Kawase Y. Jishage K. Suzuki H. Takeya M. Schnackenberg L. Beger R. Hermonat P.L. Thomas M. Sawamura T. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1634-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and backcrossed eight times with the C57BL/6 strain to replace the genetic background. Male C57BL/6 and LOX-1 KO mice weighing 22–26 g were utilized at 8–10 weeks of age. All animals received humane care in compliance with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health. Construction of AAV/TGFβ ACT1 and Generation of Recombinant AAV Stocks—The TGFβ1 mutant TGFβ ACT1 cDNA was generated, sequenced, and ligated into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, dl6–95, as described recently (14Hu C.P. Dandapat A. Liu Y. Hermonat P.L. Mehta J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: H1833-H1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recombinant AAV vector hereafter will be referred to as AAV/TGFβ ACT1. The generation of AAV/Neo virus has been described earlier (15Li D. Liu Y. Chen J. Velchala N. Amani F. Nemarkommula A. Chen K. Rayaz H. Zhang D. Liu H. Sinha A.K. Romeo F. Hermonat P.L. Mehta J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Virus stocks were generated as described previously (15Li D. Liu Y. Chen J. Velchala N. Amani F. Nemarkommula A. Chen K. Rayaz H. Zhang D. Liu H. Sinha A.K. Romeo F. Hermonat P.L. Mehta J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The titer of purified virus, in encapsidated genomes per milliliter (eg/ml), was calculated by dot-blot hybridization and determined to be ∼1011 eg/ml. Cell Culture and AAV Vector Infection—Mouse (WT and LOX-1 KO) cardiac fibroblasts were isolated and cultured as described earlier (16Chen J. Mehta J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: H1738-H1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells cultured to fifth passage were used in all experiments. To transfect the cultured cells, AAV vectors were added to cell culture dishes at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 103 and incubated with the cells for 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% air. The infection efficiency was evaluated by AAV/GFP expression using fluorescent microscopy. AAV/GFP was obtained from the University of North Carolina Gene Therapy Center, and the titer was 8 × 1012 virus particles/ml (3.1 × 1010 infectious units). Experimental Protocols—Cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with AAV vector (or only culture medium) for 72 h in the absence or presence of anti-LOX-1 antibody (10 μg/ml), nonspecific IgG (10 μg/ml), apocynin (600 μm), diphenyliodonium (10 μm), U0126 (10 μm), PD98059 (10 μm), SB203580 (10 μm), SB202190 (10 μm), gp91phox siRNA (50 nm), or non-targeting siRNA (50 nm), or Me2SO (as vehicle control). These concentrations were chosen on the basis of published data (13Mehta J.L. Sanada N. Hu C.P. Chen J. Dandapat A. Sugawara F. Satoh H. Inoue K. Kawase Y. Jishage K. Suzuki H. Takeya M.

In other experiments, cardiac fibroblasts were treated with rTGFβ1 (2 ng/ml) for 24 h. At the end of the experiments, culture medium was collected for the determination of soluble collagen production and fibroblasts were examined for measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) release and expression of specific proteins. Evaluation of Cell Growth—Cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Sigma). Meanwhile, cell number was determined in triplicate using a hemocytometer. Results were normalized to the conversion of MTT and cell number in control cultures as 100%, respectively. Soluble Collagen Assay—Soluble collagen production was determined by the Sircol assay (Biocolor) as described earlier (21Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M. Gardner B. Batra R.K. Strieter R.M. Dubinett S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as μg/106 cells. Measurement of ROS in Cardiac Fibroblasts—Intracellular ROS generation was measured with the use of 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (10 μm) fluorescent signal, a cell-permeant indicator for ROS, as described previously (14Hu C.P. Dandapat A. Liu Y. Hermonat P.L. Mehta J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: H1833-H1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Results were displayed in a ratiometric fashion normalized for the control conditions. Western Blot Analysis—The expression of TGFβ1, collagen type I, collagen type III, LOX-1, p38, and p44/42 MAPK isoforms, NADPH oxidase subunits (p22phox, p47phox, and gp91phox), or β-actin was assessed by Western analysis using standard methodologies (14Hu C.P. Dandapat A. Liu Y. Hermonat P.L. Mehta J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: H1833-H1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Densities of protein bands relative to β-actin were analyzed. Statistical Analysis—Data, based on at least four separate experiments, are expressed as means ± S.E. All values were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls-Student t test. The significance level was chosen as p < 0.05. AAV Facilitates Transfection of Fibroblasts—In pilot experiments, AAV/GFP vectors were added to cell culture dishes at an m.o.i. of 0–104 and incubated with the cells for 72 h at 37°Cin5%CO2/95% air. More than 90% of the cells showed GFP expression at m.o.i. of 103. There was no difference in GFP expression in cardiac fibroblasts from WT and LOX-1 KO mice (Fig. 1A). Because the most optimal transfection was observed at m.o.i. of 103, transfection in subsequent experiments with AAV vectors was performed at m.o.i. of 103. Increase in TGFβ1 Expression— After 72 h of AAV infection, fibroblasts were harvested for Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, total TGFβ1 expression was increased in AAV/TGFβ ACT1-transfected cells, indicating successful delivery of the transgene. AAV/Neo alone had no effect on TGFβ1 expression. Note that there was no difference in TGFβ1 expression in cardiac fibroblasts from WT and LOX-1 KO mice. AAV/TGFβ ACT1 Transfection Facilitates Cell Growth— AAV/TGFβ ACT1 transfection had a stimulatory effect on fibroblast growth, and the number of fibroblasts increased by ∼50% (versus fibroblasts kept under control conditions). This effect was much less evident in fibroblasts from LOX-1 KO mice (p < 0.01 versus AAV/TGFβ ACT1-transfected fibroblasts from wild-type mice) (Fig. 2, A and B). AAV/Neo alone had no effect on cell growth. Interaction between TGFβ ACT1, LOX-1 Expression, and Collagen Synthesis in Fibroblasts—AAV/TGFβ ACT1 transfection increased the expression of collagen type I and III (p < 0.01 versus fibroblasts kept under control conditions) in WT mouse cardiac fibroblasts, but this effect was much less pronounced in fibroblasts from LOX-1 KO mice (p < 0.01 versus AAV/TGFβ ACT1-transfected fibroblasts from WT mice) (Fig. 3A). Note that AAV/Neo alone had no effect on collagen expression. We also measured soluble collagen in the medium bathing the fibroblasts, and in keeping with collagen I and III expression data, soluble collagen increased in the supernates of AAV/TGFβ ACT1-transfected cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 3B). To further confirm the effect of AAV/TGFβ ACT1 on collagen expression, we treated cells with rTGFβ1 directly and found that the effects of rTGFβ1 were consistent with that of transfection with AAV/TGFβ ACT1 (Fig. 3C). These observations suggest that LOX-1 plays an important role in TGFβ1-induced collagen production. Because the observations in LOX-1 KO mouse cardiac fibroblasts may reflect effects of genes other than LOX-1 in modulation of TGFβ1-mediated collagen synthesis, the role of LOX-1 in the effects of TGFβ ACT1 was confirmed by use of a specific anti-LOX-1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, the expression of collagens was less in cells treated with anti-LOX-1 antibody than in fibroblasts kept under control conditions (p < 0.01). Note that nonspecific IgG had no effect on AAV/TGFβ ACT1-induced collagen expression (Fig. 4B). Interaction between TGFβ1, NADPH Oxidase, and LOX-1— Oxidant stress up-regulates the expression and activation of LOX-1 (7Hu C.P. Dandapat A. Chen J. Fujita Y. Inoue N. Kawase Y. Jishage K.I. Suzuki H. Sawamura T. Mehta J.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 76: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and activation of LOX-1 itself can stimulate the formation of ROS (22Cominacini L. Rigoni A. Pasini A.F. Garbin U. Davoli A. Campagnola M. Pastorino A.M. Lo Cascio V. Sawamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13750-13755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 23Chen X.P. Xun K.L. Wu Q. Zhang T.T. Shi J.S. Du G.H. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2007; 47: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase activation is a major source of ROS in cardiac fibroblasts (19Chen J.X. Zeng H. Tuo Q.H. Yu H. Meyrick B. Aschner J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: H1664-H1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We, therefore, measured intracellular ROS generation and NADPH oxidase expression in fibroblasts transfected with AAV/TGFβ ACT1. Indeed, AAV/TGFβ ACT1 transfection enhanced the expression of NADPH oxidase (p22phox, p47phox, and gp91phox subunits) as well as dihydrofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence reflecting intracellular ROS generation. The treatment of cells with anti-LOX-1 antibody reduced the expression of NADPH oxidase (all three subunits) (Fig. 5A). In addition, anti-LOX-1 antibody treatment reduced TGFβ ACT1-induced increase in DCF fluorescence (Fig. 5C), reflecting a reduction in intracellular ROS generation, concomitant with suppression of collagen production. Nonspecific IgG had no effect on TGFβ ACT1-induced expression of NADPH oxidase and ROS generation (Fig. 5, A and C). Further, treatment of fibroblasts with apocynin and diphenyliodonium, the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, attenuated the expression of LOX-1 as well as collagen expression despite forced up-regulation of TGFβ ACT1 (Fig. 4, A and B). To confirm the role of NADPH oxidase, we conducted experiments using gp91phox subunit knockdown methodology. As shown in Figs. 5B and 4C, gp91phox siRNA markedly inhibited the expression of gp91phox, LOX-1, and collagen induced by TGFβ ACT1. The non-targeting siRNA had no effect. Signaling of TGFβ1-LOX-1-mediated Collagen Formation—To study the intracellular signaling mechanism of LOX-1-TGFβ1 interaction, the AAV/TGFβ ACT1-transfected cardiac fibroblasts from WT mice were treated with a variety of inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, treatment of cells with the p44/42 MAPK inhibitors (U0126 and PD98059) or the p38 MAPK inhibitors (SB203580 and SB202190) reduced the expression of collagens (type I and type III) in response to AAV/TGFβ ACT1 transfection. Importantly, TGFβ ACT1-mediated up-regulation of LOX-1 was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, but not by the MAPK inhibitors, indicating that NADPH oxidase activation plays a significant role in TGFβ ACT1-mediated LOX-1 expression and that NADPH oxidase activation is upstream of MAPKs. Next, we measured the expression of redox-sensitive p38 and p44/42 MAPKs. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, the expression of p38 or p44/42 MAPKs was not altered by TGFβ ACT1 up-regulation. However, TGFβ1 up-regulation markedly increased the phosphorylation of both p38 and p44/42 MAPKs (p < 0.01), which was inhibited by anti-LOX-1 antibody, the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, and the MAPK inhibitors. AAV/Neo transfection or nonspecific IgG had no effect. In this study, we set out to examine the hypothesis that LOX-1 plays an important role in collagen generation in mouse cardiac fibroblasts in response to TGFβ1. Toward that goal, we transfected WT and LOX-1 KO mouse cardiac fibroblasts with TGFβ ACT1 using AAV as the delivery vector. In previous studies, AAV has been shown to transfect smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, and fibroblasts very efficiently (14Hu C.P. Dandapat A. Liu Y. Hermonat P.L. Mehta J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: H1833-H1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Nykanen A.I. Pajusola K. Krebs R. Keranen M.A. Raisky O. Koskinen P.K. Alitalo K. Lemstrom K.B. Circ.

Virology. 2006; 353: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed that there was >90% AAV/TGFβ ACT1 transfection efficiency at an m.o.i. of 103. In keeping with the well established role of TGFβ1 in the genesis of fibrosis, the forced up-regulation of TGFβ ACT1 in WT mouse cardiac fibroblasts dramatically enhanced the expression of collagens (types I and III) and increased the level of soluble collagen in the fibroblast supernates. We used TGFβ ACT1 to up-regulate TGFβ1 because previous studies (5Yang B.C. Zander D. Mehta J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 733-738PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hu C.P. Dandapat A. Liu Y. Hermonat P.L. Mehta J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: H1833-H1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have shown that the active moiety of TGFβ1 results in significantly greater biological effects than the latent form of TGFβ ACT1. The suggestion of a role of LOX-1 in the biological effects of TGFβ1 comes from studies that indicate that TGFβ1 influences the pro-inflammatory effect of oxidized low density lipoprotein (12Chen H. Li D. Saldeen T. Mehta J.L. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In these studies, pretreatment of endothelial cells with anti-LOX-1 antibody attenuated the synthesis of TGFβ1 in response to oxidized low density lipoprotein. Minami et al. (11Minami M. Kume N. Kataoka H. Morimoto M. Hayashida K. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Kita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) provided evidence that TGFβ1 (0.1–10 ng/ml) induces LOX-1 expression in a transcriptional manner in both bovine aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Draude and Lorenz (10Draude G. Lorenz R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1042-H1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described TGFβ1-mediated stimulation of oxidized low density lipoprotein uptake in freshly isolated and cultured human monocytes with simultaneous severalfold increase in LOX-1 mRNA. All these observations suggest a link between LOX-1 and TGFβ1 in the biology of a variety of cell types. This study provides conclusive evidence that TGFβ1-mediated collagen formation in fibroblasts involves a critical role of LOX-1. Forced overexpression of TGFβ1 in WT mouse cardiac fibroblasts induced a 3–4-fold increase in LOX-1 expression. The evidence for the critical role of LOX-1 in TGFβ1-mediated collagen formation was obtained by two different approaches: first, the use of fibroblasts from LOX-1 KO mouse hearts and second, the use of a specific monoclonal anti-LOX-1 antibody. Both these approaches resulted in a marked inhibition of TGFβ1-mediated collagen formation. It is noteworthy that TGFβ1-mediated fibroblast growth was also blocked in fibroblasts from LOX-1 KO mice. In other experiments, we observed that NADPH oxidase expression was greatly increased in WT mouse cardiac fibroblasts transfected with AAV/TGFβ ACT1. The activity of TGFβ1 has been shown to be associated with generation of ROS (26Sturrock A. Cahill B. Norman K. Huecksteadt T.P. Hill K. Sanders K. Karwande S.V. Stringham J.C. Bull D.A. Gleich M.

This was confirmed in the present studies by examination of NADPH oxidase (p22phox, p47phox, and gp91phox subunits) expression and direct measurement of intracellular ROS as DCF fluorescence. Further, ROS have been shown to activate LOX-1 (7Hu C.P. Dandapat A. Chen J. Fujita Y. Inoue N. Kawase Y. Jishage K.I. Suzuki H. Sawamura T. Mehta J.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 76: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and LOX-1 activation itself leads to ROS generation (22Cominacini L. Rigoni A. Pasini A.F. Garbin U. Davoli A. Campagnola M.

We observed that the inhibition of NADPH oxidase by apocynin, diphenyliodonium, or gp91phox siRNA reduced LOX-1 expression and collagen formation in WT mouse cardiac fibroblasts despite forced up-regulation of TGFβ ACT1. Interestingly, treatment of fibroblasts with the anti-LOX-1 antibody itself reduced the up-regulation of NADPH oxidase (p22phox, p47phox, and gp91phox subunits) despite forced up-regulation of TGFβ1. These observations provide compelling evidence for a positive feedback between TGFβ1, NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS generation, and LOX-1 (summarized in Fig. 7). Next, we examined the role of redox-sensitive MAPKs in TGFβ1-mediated collagen formation. The AAV/TGFβ ACT1-transfected WT mouse cardiac fibroblasts did not exhibit any change in p38 or p44/42 MAPK protein levels, but their phosphorylation was increased 2–3-fold. MAPK phosphorylation was blocked by the treatment of cells with NADPH oxidase inhibitors as well as anti-LOX-1 antibody. On the other hand, treatment of fibroblasts with the MAPK inhibitors significantly reduced the expression of collagens in fibroblasts transfected with AAV/TGFβ ACT1 without effect on LOX-1 expression (Fig. 4), suggesting that MAPK activation is downstream of ROS generation in response to TGFβ1-NADPH oxidase-LOX-1 cascade (Fig. 7). In essence, this study provides the missing link between TGFβ1 activation and collagen formation in the heart during pro-oxidant states such as hypertension and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Identification of LOX-1 as an important molecule in TGFβ1-mediated collagen synthesis provides a new target for therapy of disease states characterized by excessive tissue remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1974927824,"Many well-documented biochemical processes lack a molecular mechanism. Examples are: how ATP hydrolysis and an enzyme contrive to perform work, such as active transport; how peptides are formed from amino acids and DNA from nucleotides; how proteases cleave peptide bonds, how bone mineralses; how enzymes distinguish between sodium and potassium; how chirality of biopolymers was established prebiotically.It is shown that involvement of water in all these processes is mandatory, but the water must be of the simplified configuration in which there are only two strengths of water-water hydrogen bonds, and in which these two types of water coexist as microdomains throughout the liquid temperature range. Since they have different strengths of hydrogen bonds, the microdomains differ in all their physical and chemical properties. Solutes partition asymmetrically, generating osmotic pressure gradients which must be compensated for or abolished. Displacement of the equilibrium between high and low density waters incurs a thermodynamic cost which limits solubility, depresses ionisation of water, drives protein folding and prevents high density water from boiling at its intrinsic boiling point which appears to be below 0 degrees C. Active processes in biochemistry take place in sequential partial reactions, most of which release small amounts of free energy as heat. This ensures that the system is never far from equilibrium so that efficiency is extremely high. Energy transduction is neither possible and nor necessary. Chirality was probably established in prebiotic clays which must have carried stable populations of high density and low density water domains. Bioactive enantiomorphs partition into low density water in which they polymerise spontaneously.The simplified model of water has great explanatory power."
https://openalex.org/W1982840240,"Bats tend to have less intestinal tissue than comparably sized nonflying mammals. The corresponding reduction in intestinal volume and hence mass of digesta carried is advantageous because the costs of flight increase with load carried and because take-off and maneuverability are diminished at heavier masses. Water soluble compounds, such as glucose and amino acids, are absorbed in the small intestine mainly via two pathways, the transporter-mediated transcellular and the passive, paracellular pathways. Using the microchiropteran bat Artibeus literatus (mean mass 80.6±3.7 g), we tested the predictions that absorption of water-soluble compounds that are not actively transported would be extensive as a compensatory mechanism for relatively less intestinal tissue, and would decline with increasing molecular mass in accord with sieve-like paracellular absorption. Using a standard pharmacokinetic technique, we fed, or injected intraperitonealy the metabolically inert carbohydrates L-rhamnose (molecular mass = 164 Da) and cellobiose (molecular mass = 342 Da) which are absorbed only by paracellular transport, and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3OMD-glucose) which is absorbed via both mediated (active) and paracellular transport. As predicted, the bioavailability of paracellular probes declined with increasing molecular mass (rhamnose, 90±11%; cellobiose, 10±3%, n = 8) and was significantly higher in bats than has been reported for laboratory rats and other mammals. In addition, absorption of 3OMD-glucose was high (96±11%). We estimated that the bats rely on passive, paracellular absorption for more than 70% of their total glucose absorption, much more than in non-flying mammals. Although possibly compensating for less intestinal tissue, a high intestinal permeability that permits passive absorption might be less selective than a carrier-mediated system for nutrient absorption and might permit toxins to be absorbed from plant and animal material in the intestinal lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1987052891,"The island of Sardinia shows a unique high incidence of several autoimmune diseases with multifactorial inheritance, particularly type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The prior knowledge of the genetic structure of this population is fundamental to establish the optimal design for association studies in these diseases. Previous work suggested that the Sardinians are a relatively homogenous population, but some reports were contradictory and data were largely based on variants subject to selection. For an unbiased assessment of genetic structure, we studied a combination of neutral Y-chromosome variants, 21 biallelic and 8 short tandem repeats (STRs) in 930 Sardinian males. We found a high degree of interindividual variation but a homogenous distribution of the detected variability in samples from three separate regions of the island. One haplogroup, I-M26, is rare or absent outside Sardinia and is very common (0.37 frequency) throughout the island, consistent with a founder effect. A Bayesian full likelihood analysis (BATWING) indicated that the time from the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of I-M26, was 21.0 (16.0-25.5) thousand years ago (KYA) and that the population began to expand 14.0 (7.8-22.0) KYA. These results suggest a largely pre-Neolithic settlement of the island with little subsequent gene flow from outside populations. Consequently, Sardinia is an especially attractive venue for case-control genome wide association scans in common multifactorial diseases. Concomitantly, the high degree of interindividual variation in the current population facilitates fine mapping efforts to pinpoint the aetiologic polymorphisms."
https://openalex.org/W2103809584,"Sensory processing in the brain is thought to have evolved to encode naturally occurring stimuli efficiently. We report an adaptation in binocular cortical neurons that reflects the tight constraints imposed by the geometry of 3D vision. We show that the widely used binocular energy model predicts that neurons dedicate part of their dynamic range to impossible combinations of left and right images. Approximately 42% of the neurons we record from V1 of awake monkeys behave in this way (a powerful confirmation of the model), while about 58% deviate from the model in a manner that concentrates more of their dynamic range on stimuli that obey the constraints of binocular geometry. We propose a simple extension of the energy model, using multiple subunits, that explains the adaptation we observe, as well as other properties of binocular neurons that have been hard to account for, such as the response to anticorrelated stereograms."
https://openalex.org/W2062415152,"Nearly full-length genome sequencing of HIV-1 using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) DNA as a template for PCR is now a relatively routine laboratory procedure. However, this has not been the case when using virion RNA as the template and this has made full genome analysis of circulating viruses difficult. Therefore, a well-developed procedure for sequencing of full-length HIV-1 RNA directly from plasma was needed. Plasma from U.S. donors representing a range of viral loads (VL) was used to develop the assay. RNA was extracted from plasma and reverse-transcribed. Two or three overlapping regions were PCR amplified to cover the entire viral genome and sequenced for verification. The success of the procedure was sensitive to VL but was routinely successful for VL greater than 10(5) and the rate declined in proportion to the VL. While the two-amplicon strategy had an advantage of increasing the possibility of amplifying a single species of HIV-1, the three-amplicon strategy was more successful in amplifying samples with low viral loads. This protocol provides a useful tool for molecular analysis to understand the HIV epidemic and pathogenesis, as well as diagnosis, therapy and future vaccine strategies."

Furthermore, our results show that secreted ceramidase is internalized and localizes to endosomes. Our findings establish a role for a secreted sphingolipid enzyme in the regulation of photoreceptor structure and function. Sphingolipids are essential structural components of membranes and regulate membrane architecture (Holthuis et al., 2001Holthuis J.C. Pomorski T. Raggers R.J. Sprong H. Van Meer G. The organizing potential of sphingolipids in intracellular membrane transport.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1689-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Many sphingolipids, such as ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate, are also bioactive molecules that regulate diverse cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, among others (Dickson, 1998Dickson R.C.

Generally, ceramide and sphingosine promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation, while sphingosine 1-phosphate promotes growth and inhibits apoptosis (Hannun and Obeid, 2002Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M.

Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 882-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ceramide is a precursor for sphingosine, sphingosine 1-phosphate, sphingomyelin, and complex sphingolipids. Enzymes involved in the generation and conversion of these sphingolipids are conserved across species (Futerman and Riezman, 2005Futerman A.H. Riezman H. The ins and outs of sphingolipid synthesis.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Ceramidases (CDases) hydrolyze ceramide to sphingosine, which is subsequently phosphorylated to sphingosine 1-phosphate. CDases are thus key enzymes that attenuate ceramide-mediated effects and regulate ceramide/sphingosine/sphingosine 1-phosphate levels in cells. CDases are classified as acid, neutral, or alkaline based on their pH optimum. A deficiency of acid CDase causes Farber's disease in humans, in which ceramide accumulates in the lysosomes (Sugita et al., 1972Sugita M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Ceramidase deficiency in Farber's disease (lipogranulomatosis).Science. 1972; 178: 1100-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Drosophila has one neutral CDase and no known acid CDase homolog (Acharya and Acharya, 2005Acharya U. Acharya J.K. Enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 128-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Drosophila phototransduction, a prototypic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascade, is initiated when the visual pigment rhodopsin absorbs light (Hardie and Raghu, 2001Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Visual transduction in Drosophila.Nature. 2001; 413: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, Montell, 1999Montell C. Visual transduction in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

USA. 1996; 93: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin activates a heterotrimeric G protein, Gq, and the effector for Gq is phospholipase C (NorpA). Activation of NorpA leads to the opening of light-sensitive cation channels (Trp and Trpl), by a mechanism that is not completely understood. Termination of the cascade is achieved by the binding of arrestins (Arr1 and Arr2) to rhodopsin, leading to its inactivation. In the current study, we show that CDase acts in a cell-nonautonomous manner to maintain photoreceptor homeostasis. CDase null mutations, obtained by chemical mutagenesis, are embryonic lethal. Clones of cdase null mutant photoreceptors generated in a CDase heterozygous background do not degenerate. However, we have identified a genetic background from which cdase null adult flies can be recovered. The photoreceptors of these CDase null flies undergo light-dependent degeneration, signifying that cell-nonautonomous function of CDase suppresses degeneration in mosaic mutant clones. In earlier studies, we showed that targeted overexpression of ceramidase in photoreceptors suppresses retinal degeneration in certain Drosophila phototransduction mutants (arrestin and norpA) and facilitates the dissolution of incompletely formed rhabdomeric membranes in a rhodopsin mutant (Acharya et al., 2003Acharya U. Patel S. Koundakjian E. Nagashima K. Han X. Acharya J.K. Modulating sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway rescues photoreceptor degeneration.Science. 2003; 299: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Acharya et al., 2004Acharya U. Mowen M.B. Nagashima K. Acharya J.K. Ceramidase expression facilitates membrane turnover and endocytosis of rhodopsin in photoreceptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, we show that, consistent with a cell-nonautonomous function, targeted expression of CDase in a tissue distant from photoreceptors (such as the fat body or mushroom body) is capable of suppressing retinal degeneration in an arrestin mutant and accelerating the turnover of involuting rhabdomeric membranes in a rhodopsin mutant. We also show that secreted CDase is internalized from the cell surface and localizes to the endosomes. Our data indicate that CDase participates in the normal endocytic turnover of the arrestin-rhodopsin complex in photoreceptors. The findings that CDase acts in a cell-nonautonomous manner to promote the survival and function of photoreceptors may have important clinical applications for suppressing retinal degeneration in humans. In addition, these results provide direct evidence that sphingolipid metabolism plays important physiological roles both extracellularly, at the plasma membrane, and within the endocytic compartments. To isolate cdase mutants, we used a western blot-based ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis screen described previously (Acharya et al., 2006Acharya U. Edwards M.B. Jorquera R.A. Silva H. Nagashima K. Labarca P. Acharya J.K. Drosophila melanogaster Scramblases modulate synaptic transmission.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The screening strategy was based on the loss of CDase antigen in immunoblots from EMS-mutagenized flies that were viable over a deficiency that uncovers the CDase gene region (see Figure S1A available online). Lethal lines that were generated in the screen were carried over a balancer and subjected to transgenic rescue with a genomic copy of CDase. 2392 lines were established, of which 21 lines were lethal over the deficiency. Transgenic rescue experiments with these lines led to the isolation of the cdase1 mutation, which harbors a G to A transition at amino acid 641, converting a tryptophan residue into a stop codon (Figure S1B). The mutated gene encodes an extremely unstable protein, given that no endogenous protein corresponding to the mutant version is visible in western blots of cdase1 null flies (as described in section corresponding to Figure 2A). Because EMS causes random mutations throughout the chromosomes, all other incidental mutations within the cdase1 mutant were removed by three successive outcrossings to control w1118 chromosomes. The cdase1 mutation was a homozygous lethal; mutant animals died at late embryonic stages. Adult flies could be recovered when carrying a transgene with a genomic copy of CDase. To analyze the cdase1 lethal mutants, we generated mosaics in the eye using the ey-FLP/FRT system in combination with a cell-lethal mutation on the wild-type chromosome (Newsome et al., 2000Newsome T.P. Asling B. Dickson B.J. Analysis of photoreceptor axon guidance in eye-specific mosaics.Development. 2000; 127: 851-860PubMed Google Scholar). In these mosaics, almost the entire eye is homozygous for the mutation while the rest of the animal is heterozygous for CDase (Figure 1A). Based on our earlier results showing that targeted overexpression of CDase rescues photoreceptor degeneration in certain phototransduction mutants, we predicted that CDase would play a significant role in photoreceptor homeostasis (Acharya et al., 2003Acharya U. Patel S. Koundakjian E. Nagashima K. Han X. Acharya J.K. Modulating sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway rescues photoreceptor degeneration.Science. 2003; 299: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, we looked at cdase1 mosaic photoreceptors for ultrastructural abnormalities by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1B). Each of the 800 ommatidia of a Drosophila compound eye consists of eight photoreceptor cells (R1 to R8). Each cell has a rhabdomere, a specialized microvillar structure derived from the plasma membrane that houses the phototransduction machinery. Rhabdomere architecture is sensitive to perturbations in the phototransduction cascade and has been used to monitor photoreceptor degeneration (Montell, 1999Montell C. Visual transduction in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 231-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). cdase1 mosaics aged to 15 days posteclosion showed a normal rhabdomere architecture (Figure 1B, right panel; compare with wild-type, left panel). Because the cdase1 mosaic photoreceptors were morphologically normal, we performed immunocytochemistry on mosaic eye discs with antibodies to CDase to ascertain the lack of CDase protein in the developing eye (Figure 1C). Surprisingly, the cdase1 mosaic tissue still showed staining for CDase, despite being genetically null for this protein (Figure 1C, middle panel). Similarly, full-length CDase (not the truncated product encoded by the mutant message) was detected in western blots of retinal extracts from the mosaic eyes (Figure 1D). As a control for our method, we generated similar photoreceptor null mutations in a crumbs mutant, whose gene product, crumbs, is required for photoreceptor morphogenesis and maintenance (Izaddoost et al., 2002Izaddoost S. Nam S.C. Bhat M.A. Bellen H.J. Choi K.W. Drosophila Crumbs is a positional cue in photoreceptor adherens junctions and rhabdomeres.Nature. 2002; 416: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, Pellikka et al., 2002Pellikka M.

Crumbs, the Drosophila homologue of human CRB1/RP12 is essential for photoreceptor morphogenesis.Nature. 2002; 416: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Retinal extracts from crumbs mosaic tissue do not show any crumbs protein, unlike cdase mosaics that show CDase protein (Figure 1D). We reasoned that our findings were due to CDase being a secreted protein (Tani et al., 2003Tani M. Iida H. Ito M. O-glycosylation of mucin-like domain retains the neutral ceramidase on the plasma membranes as a type II integral membrane protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10523-10530Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Yoshimura et al., 2002Yoshimura Y. Okino N. Tani M. Ito M. Molecular cloning and characterization of a secretory neutral ceramidase of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Most likely, CDase synthesized elsewhere in the animal was transported to the mutant eye tissue. This interpretation could account for CDase staining observed in the homozygous null eyes and perhaps their lack of structural defects. In case of a nonsecreted protein like crumbs, genetically null clones are truly devoid of protein because crumbs will not be transported to the mutant cells from heterozygous tissues. The results of these mosaic analysis experiments also indicated that this approach was not a feasible way to analyze CDase function in vivo. Further study would require the development of a functional cdase null mutant that gave rise to viable adult flies. During the course of our studies, we observed that the original cdase1 chromosome, though a homozygous lethal, generated some viable progeny (less than 5%) when crossed to a deficiency that uncovers the CDase region, because of the presence of a closely linked suppressor mutation on the same chromosome. The frequency of viable flies was rescued to normal Mendelian ratios with the introduction of a genomic copy of CDase, which indicated that the CDase mutation contributed to the lethality in this genotype and that the suppressor mutation rescued some of the lethality. The identity of this viable suppressor mutation is currently unknown. Further examination of the viable adults by western analysis of lysates with several polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against CDase showed that these flies were devoid of CDase protein (Figure 2A). Furthermore, a measurement of neutral CDase activity showed no detectable activity (Figure 2B). Immunostaining of eye discs from mutant third-instar larvae of this line did not show any CDase immunoreactivity either (Figure 1B, last panel). Therefore, we concluded that these flies were functional null mutants for CDase. The identification of this viable CDase null mutant has permitted us to continue our in vivo studies. Given that photoreceptor-targeted overexpression of CDase rescues degenerating photoreceptors in certain phototransduction mutants (Acharya et al., 2003Acharya U. Patel S. Koundakjian E. Nagashima K. Han X. Acharya J.K. Modulating sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway rescues photoreceptor degeneration.Science. 2003; 299: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we conducted photoreceptor structure-function studies with the cdase1 functional null mutants (hereafter called cdase1 null). The adult mutant flies were raised in regular light and dark cycles and maintained for varying numbers of days after eclosion; their photoreceptors were then examined by TEM. As shown in Figure 3A (second panel), 5-day-old flies showed severe photoreceptor degeneration. Many photoreceptor cells were missing their rhabdomeres and had vacuolated cell bodies. This degenerative phenotype was completely rescued by introducing a genomic copy of CDase, indicating that the loss of CDase was responsible for the observed photoreceptor degeneration (Figure 3A, third panel). While the suppressor mutation rescues some lethality, it is unable to compensate for lack of CDase in photoreceptors. One likely explanation is that the high turnover of membranes and signaling molecules in active photoreceptors may create a greater requirement of CDase in this cell type compared to others. To find out whether the retinal degeneration of cdase1 null mutants depended on light activation of the phototransduction cascade, we raised mutant flies in constant darkness for varying periods and observed their photoreceptors by TEM. As expected for a light-dependent effect, photoreceptors of the dark-raised, 5-day-old mutant flies did not show morphological signs of degeneration (Figure 3A, last panel). This finding also ruled out the possibility that the photoreceptor degeneration was the result of a developmental defect. Furthermore, because CDase localizes to the rhabdomeres and the subrhabdomeric areas of wild-type photoreceptors (Figure 3B), it seems that CDase plays a local role in the survival and function of the photoreceptors. The observation from mosaic experiments that CDase null photoreceptors in a heterozygous background did not degenerate (Figure 1B) had led us to believe that CDase, which is secreted, acts in a cell-nonautonomous manner (Figure 1C, middle and last panels). To determine whether CDase expressed in a different tissue could indeed reach the photoreceptors, we expressed the enzyme using UAS-CDase transgenic lines in the fat bodies of wild-type flies using a fat-body-specific GAL4 line (Hrdlicka et al., 2002Hrdlicka L. Gibson M. Kiger A. Micchelli C. Schober M. Schock F. Perrimon N. Analysis of twenty-four Gal4 lines in Drosophila melanogaster.Genesis. 2002; 34: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). (The fat body of Drosophila is the functional equivalent of mammalian liver and adipose tissue.) As expected, western analysis of extracts from dissected fat bodies of these flies show overexpression of CDase (Figure 4A, upper right panel). We also isolated retina from these fat-body-driven flies for western analysis. The blots showed that expression of CDase in the fat body resulted in significant accumulation of CDase in retinal lysastes (Figure 4A, lower right panel). In contrast, a nonsecreted protein, crumbs, when overexpressed under the control of the same fat body driver (Figure 4A, upper left panel), did not accumulate in the retina (Figure 4A, lower left panel). We also visualized the fat-body-driven CDase that accumulates in the retinal tissue using the cdase1 null background. We isolated eye discs from larvae expressing fat-body-driven CDase in the cdase1 null and stained these discs for the protein. As shown in Figure 4B, mutant eye discs did not show CDase staining, while eye discs from mutants expressing CDase in the fat body displayed robust staining for CDase. Thus, protein made in the fat body reached the eye discs of the cdase1 null animals. To test whether CDase transported to photoreceptors is active, we measured enzyme activity after dissecting retina from cdase1 null flies and cdase1 null flies expressing fat-body-driven CDase. While the mutant shows no activity, retinal extracts from mutants expressing fat-body-driven CDase show high enzyme activity (Figure 4C). These results show that CDase that reaches the target site (i.e., photoreceptors) from a distant tissue is active in hydrolyzing ceramide. We next examined whether CDase indeed functioned cell-nonautonomously, as we suspected. To do so, we asked whether overexpression of CDase by the fat body was sufficient to rescue the photoreceptor degeneration of an arrestin (arr23) mutant and promote membrane turnover in a rhodopsin null (ninaEI17) mutant. As shown in Figure 4D, fat body expression of CDase in arr23 suppressed photoreceptor degeneration (top panel), and its expression in ninaEI17 enhanced the turnover of involuting rhabdomeric elements (bottom panel). These results are similar to those obtained by expressing CDase specifically in the photoreceptors of these mutants (Acharya et al., 2003Acharya U. Patel S. Koundakjian E. Nagashima K. Han X. Acharya J.K. Modulating sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway rescues photoreceptor degeneration.Science. 2003; 299: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Acharya et al., 2004Acharya U. Mowen M.B. Nagashima K. Acharya J.K. Ceramidase expression facilitates membrane turnover and endocytosis of rhodopsin in photoreceptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and they demonstrate that extracellular CDase is indeed capable of modulating the phenotypes caused by these mutations. To further validate that CDase can function cell-nonautonomously, we performed similar experiments after ectopically overexpressing CDase in the mushroom body neurons (Schwaerzel et al., 2002Schwaerzel M. Heisenberg M. Zars T. Extinction antagonizes olfactory memory at the subcellular level.Neuron. 2002; 35: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mushroom bodies are centers of olfactory memory in Drosophila. As seen in Figure S3, here too, CDase reaches the retina (Figure S3A) and has similar effects in arr23 (Figure S3B, upper panel) and ninaEI17 mutants (Figure S3B, lower panel). Our staining experiments indicate that extracellular CDase can be transported to the photoreceptors. Because CDase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramide to sphingosine and a fatty acid, we carried out experiments to test whether a decrease in substrate (ceramide) or formation of products (sphingosine or fatty acid) could be responsible for CDase function in this study. We used electrospray tandem mass spectrometry to estimate the ceramide levels in lipid extracts prepared from control, cdase1 null mutant, and fat-body-driven CDase in cdase1 null flies and identified molecular species of ceramide containing tetradecasphingenine by negative ion ESI/MS/MS, as described previously (Acharya et al., 2003Acharya U.

Lipid extracts from the mutant flies showed an increase in total ceramide levels compared with those from wild-type controls, showing that one of the consequences of a CDase mutation is increased ceramide levels (Figure 5A). Overexpression of CDase in the fat body in CDase mutant background results in significant decrease in ceramide level (Figure 5A). CDase action not only decreases ceramide levels, it also leads to formation of sphingosine. To evaluate whether formation of sphingosine was responsible for CDase's action, we tested whether increased sphingosine could suppress the degeneration in cdase1 null mutant. Lace encodes for one of the subunits of Drosophila serine palmitoyltransferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of sphingolipid biosynthesis, and lace mutants are lethal (Adachi-Yamada et al., 1999Adachi-Yamada T. Gotoh T. Sugimura I. Nishida Y. Onuki T. Date H. De novo synthesis of sphingolipids is required for cell survival by down-regulating c-Jun N-terminal kinase in Drosophila imaginal discs.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7276-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has been shown earlier that viability of lace alleles deficient in de novo biosynthesis of sphingosine is promoted when they are raised in food supplemented with sphingosine. Using rescue of lace lethality as evidence for sphingosine function in vivo, we raised cdase1 null mutant flies in food supplemented with sphingosine and examined their photoreceptors by electron microscopy. Wild-type photoreceptors are not affected by feeding sphingosine (Figure 5B). Sphingosine feeding does not suppress degeneration observed in cdase1 null photoreceptors (compare Figures 5C and 5D). This experiment suggests that sphingosine on its own is not a likely candidate for the observed effects of CDase in the present study. N-linked saturated fatty acid is the second product of CDase action. While we cannot currently rule out the role for a fatty acid in this process, our unpublished observations with ceramide kinase mutant and its overexpression in CDase mutants support the notion that CDase's function correlates with ceramide levels rather than sphingosine or fatty acid (U.D. and U.A., unpublished data). Our observations that CDase reaches photoreceptors from other tissues combined with the fact that ceramides are very hydrophobic and found only in membranous structures lead us to propose that local action of CDase is responsible for its effect on photoreceptors. CDase might first function at the cell surface and then affect intracellular events, such as membrane turnover or endocytosis and/or function, after being internalized from the cell surface. To investigate CDase's mechanism of action, we tested whether extracellular CDase could bind ceramide on the cell surface in vitro. We stably expressed a V5 epitope-tagged CDase in Schneider cells. Protein expression in this cell line was induced, and the culture medium containing the tagged, extracellular CDase was collected and partially purified. The tagged CDase had ceramide-hydrolyzing activity, as demonstrated by the conversion of NBD-ceramide to NBD-fatty acid (Figure 6B, last panel). To determine whether extracellular CDase in fact hydrolyzed ceramide at the cell surface, we knocked down endogenous CDase expression in S2 cells by RNAi (Figure 6A) and incubated the cells with fluorescent ceramide (C12 NBD-ceramide) to incorporate this analog into the plasma membrane (Marks et al., 2005Marks D.L. Singh R.D. Choudhury A. Wheatley C.L. Pagano R.E. Use of fluorescent sphingolipid analogs to study lipid transport along the endocytic pathway.Methods. 2005; 36: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The RNAi-treated cells were pelleted, washed, and incubated with either V5-tagged CDase or buffer alone. The lipids were then extracted from the cells and separated by thin-layer chromatography. We found increased hydrolysis (about 40%) of the C12 NBD-ceramide in the cells that were incubated with the tagged CDase (NBD-Cer + CDase), compared with the control cells (NBD-Cer no CDase) (Figure 6B). Therefore, extracellularly added CDase metabolized the C12 NBD-ceramide at the cell surface. In our fat body CDase expression experiment, we detected punctate intracellular staining of the CDase protein in eye discs, which suggested that CDase might be internalized (see Figure 4B, inset). We also saw similar intracellular staining for CDase in normal eye imaginal discs (Figure S2). Therefore, we used S2 cells to investigate further whether extracellular CDase is internalized. We incubated S2 cells with the V5-tagged enzyme as the source of extracellular CDase and monitored the fate of the tagged enzyme by immunofluorescence analysis. The analysis showed the appearance of punctate fluorescent dots within the cytoplasm, which indicated that the extracellular CDase had been internalized (Figure 6C). To determine this, we stained S2 cells with markers of intracellular compartments and examined their localization relative to that of the V5-tagged CDase. The endocytic markers, Rab 11 (Figure 6D) dextran and Drosophila Rab5 (data not shown), colocalized with the internalized CDase, while a Golgi marker, lava lamp (Figure 6E), did not show colocalization (Dollar et al., 2002Dollar G. Struckhoff E. Michaud J. Cohen R.S.

https://openalex.org/W2111883174,"North American monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) undergo a spectacular fall migration. In contrast to summer butterflies, migrants are juvenile hormone (JH) deficient, which leads to reproductive diapause and increased longevity. Migrants also utilize time-compensated sun compass orientation to help them navigate to their overwintering grounds. Here, we describe a brain expressed sequence tag (EST) resource to identify genes involved in migratory behaviors. A brain EST library was constructed from summer and migrating butterflies. Of 9,484 unique sequences, 6068 had positive hits with the non-redundant protein database; the EST database likely represents approximately 52% of the gene-encoding potential of the monarch genome. The brain transcriptome was cataloged using Gene Ontology and compared to Drosophila. Monarch genes were well represented, including those implicated in behavior. Three genes involved in increased JH activity (allatotropin, juvenile hormone acid methyltransfersase, and takeout) were upregulated in summer butterflies, compared to migrants. The locomotion-relevant turtle gene was marginally upregulated in migrants, while the foraging and single-minded genes were not differentially regulated. Many of the genes important for the monarch circadian clock mechanism (involved in sun compass orientation) were in the EST resource, including the newly identified cryptochrome 2. The EST database also revealed a novel Na+/K+ ATPase allele predicted to be more resistant to the toxic effects of milkweed than that reported previously. Potential genetic markers were identified from 3,486 EST contigs and included 1599 double-hit single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 98 microsatellite polymorphisms. These data provide a template of the brain transcriptome for the monarch butterfly. Our ""snap-shot"" analysis of the differential regulation of candidate genes between summer and migratory butterflies suggests that unbiased, comprehensive transcriptional profiling will inform the molecular basis of migration. The identified SNPs and microsatellite polymorphisms can be used as genetic markers to address questions of population and subspecies structure."
https://openalex.org/W1988853231,"Very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) have long been known to be degraded exclusively in peroxisomes via beta-oxidation. A defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation results in elevated levels of VLCFAs and is associated with the most frequent inherited disorder of the central nervous system white matter, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Recently, we demonstrated that VLCFAs can also undergo omega-oxidation, which may provide an alternative route for the breakdown of VLCFAs. The omega-oxidation of VLCFA is initiated by CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B, which produce omega-hydroxy-VLCFAs. In this article, we characterized the enzymes involved in the formation of very-long-chain dicarboxylic acids from omega-hydroxy-VLCFAs. We demonstrate that very-long-chain dicarboxylic acids are produced via two independent pathways. The first is mediated by an as yet unidentified, microsomal NAD(+)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase and fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is encoded by the ALDH3A2 gene and is deficient in patients with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome. The second pathway involves the NADPH-dependent hydroxylation of omega-hydroxy-VLCFAs by CYP4F2, CYP4F3B, or CYP4F3A. Enzyme kinetic studies show that oxidation of omega-hydroxy-VLCFAs occurs predominantly via the NAD(+)-dependent route. Overall, our data demonstrate that in humans all enzymes are present for the complete conversion of VLCFAs to their corresponding very-long-chain dicarboxylic acids."
https://openalex.org/W1976338750,"Alternative splicing of transcripts in a signal-dependent manner has emerged as an important concept to ensure appropriate expression of splice variants under different conditions. Binding of the general splicing factor U2AF to splice sites preceding alternatively spliced exons has been suggested to be an important step for splice site recognition. For splicing to proceed, U2AF has to be replaced by other factors. We show here that U2AF interacts with the signal-dependent splice regulator Sam68 and that forced expression of Sam68 results in enhanced binding of the U2AF65 subunit to an alternatively spliced pre-mRNA sequence in vivo. Conversely, the rapid signal-induced and phosphorylation-dependent interference with Sam68 binding to RNA was accompanied by reduced pre-mRNA occupancy of U2AF in vivo. Our data suggest that Sam68 can affect splice site occupancy by U2AF in signal-dependent splicing. We propose that the induced release of U2AF from pre-mRNA provides a regulatory step to control alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2109972689,"Background We initiated differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into dopamine neurons, obtained a purified population of neuronal precursor cells by cell sorting, and determined patterns of gene transcription. Methodology Dopaminergic differentiation of hESCs was initiated by culturing hESCs with a feeder layer of PA6 cells. Differentiating cells were then sorted to obtain a pure population of PSA-NCAM-expressing neuronal precursors, which were then analyzed for gene expression using Massive Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS). Individual genes as well as regions of the genome which were activated were determined. Principal Findings A number of genes known to be involved in the specification of dopaminergic neurons, including MSX1, CDKN1C, Pitx1 and Pitx2, as well as several novel genes not previously associated with dopaminergic differentiation, were expressed. Notably, we found that a specific region of the genome located on chromosome 11p15.5 was highly activated. This region contains several genes which have previously been associated with the function of dopaminergic neurons, including the gene for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, IGF2, and CDKN1C, which cooperates with Nurr1 in directing the differentiation of dopaminergic neurons. Other genes in this region not previously recognized as being involved in the functions of dopaminergic neurons were also activated, including H19, TSSC4, and HBG2. IGF2 and CDKN1C were also found to be highly expressed in mature human TH-positive dopamine neurons isolated from human brain samples by laser capture. Conclusions The present data suggest that the H19-IGF2 imprinting region on chromosome 11p15.5 is involved in the process through which undifferentiated cells are specified to become neuronal precursors and/or dopaminergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2030161653,"Cytosine-5 methyltransferases of the Dnmt2 family are highly conserved in evolution and their biological function is being studied in several organisms. Although all structural DNA methyltransferase motifs are present in Dnmt2, these enzymes show a strong tRNA methyltransferase activity. In line with an enzymatic activity towards substrates other than DNA, Dnmt2 has been described to localize to the cytoplasm. Using molecular and biochemical approaches we show here that Dnmt2 is both a cytoplasmic and a nuclear protein. Sub-cellular fractionation shows that a significant amount of Dnmt2 is bound to the nuclear matrix. Sub-cellular localization analysis reveals that Dnmt2 proteins are enriched in actively dividing cells. Dnmt2 localization is highly dynamic during the cell cycle. Using live imaging we observed that Dnmt2-EGFP enters prophase nuclei and shows a spindle-like localization pattern during mitotic divisions. Additional experiments suggest that this localization is microtubule dependent and that Dnmt2 can access DNA during mitotic cell divisions. Our results represent the first comprehensive characterization of Dnmt2 proteins on the cellular level and have important implications for our understanding of the molecular activities of Dnmt2."
https://openalex.org/W2066680913,"Neurabin is a scaffolding protein that interacts with actin and protein phosphatase-1. Highly enriched in the dendritic spine, neurabin is important for spine morphogenesis and synaptic formation. However, less is known about the role of neurabin in hippocampal plasticity and its possible effect on behavioral functions. Using neurabin knockout (KO) mice, here we studied the function of neurabin in hippocampal synaptic transmission, plasticity and behavioral memory. We demonstrated that neurabin KO mice showed a deficit in contextual fear memory but not auditory fear memory. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in the hippocampal CA1 neurons showed that long-term potentiation (LTP) was significantly reduced, whereas long-term depression (LTD) was unaltered in neurabin KO mice. Moreover, increased AMPA receptor but not NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission was found in neurabin KO mice, and is accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of GluR1 at the PKA site (Ser845) but no change at the CaMKII/PKC site (Ser831). Pre-conditioning with LTD induction rescued the following LTP in neurabin KO mice, suggesting the loss of LTP may be due to the saturated synaptic transmission. Our results indicate that neurabin regulates contextual fear memory and LTP in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2012468900,"Although synaptic functions of ionotropic glutamate receptors in the olfactory bulb have been studied in vitro, their roles in pattern processing in the intact system remain controversial. We therefore examined the functions of ionotropic glutamate receptors during odor processing in the intact olfactory bulb of zebrafish using pharmacological manipulations. Odor responses of mitral cells and interneurons were recorded by electrophysiology and 2-photon Ca2+ imaging. The combined blockade of AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors abolished odor-evoked excitation of mitral cells. The blockade of AMPA/kainate receptors alone, in contrast, increased the mean response of mitral cells and decreased the mean response of interneurons. The blockade of NMDA receptors caused little or no change in the mean responses of mitral cells and interneurons. However, antagonists of both receptor types had diverse effects on the magnitude and time course of individual mitral cell and interneuron responses and, thus, changed spatio-temporal activity patterns across neuronal populations. Oscillatory synchronization was abolished or reduced by AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptor antagonists, respectively. These results indicate that (1) interneuron responses depend mainly on AMPA/kainate receptor input during an odor response, (2) interactions among mitral cells and interneurons regulate the total olfactory bulb output activity, (3) AMPA/kainate receptors participate in the synchronization of odor-dependent neuronal ensembles, and (4) ionotropic glutamate receptor-containing synaptic circuits shape odor-specific patterns of olfactory bulb output activity. These mechanisms are likely to be important for the processing of odor-encoding activity patterns in the olfactory bulb."
https://openalex.org/W2083558947,"Follistatins exert critical autocrine or paracrine control in many tissues by binding and bio-neutralizing activin and several other transforming growth factor-β ligands. In the pituitary, activin acts locally to induce follistatin expression and thus modulate its own actions. This local feedback loop safeguards against excessive activin signaling and maintains the necessary balance of activin and follistatin tone. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the activation of follistatin by activin A, follistatin transcription was evaluated in gonadotrope-derived αT3-1 cells. Transient transfection experiments established that follistatin-luciferase plasmids that incorporate up to 2.86 kb of the upstream region of the rat follistatin gene are not induced by activin A in αT3-1 cells. On the other hand, plasmids that incorporate intron 1 are responsive to activin A and induced by a constitutively active form of ALK4. These experiments ultimately identified a conserved Smad-binding element (SBE1) in intron 1, between +1791 and +1795. In αT3-1 cells treated with activin A, SBE1 preferentially recruits Smad3, but not Smad2, and mediates Smad3-dependent activation of follistatin transcription. shRNA knockdown of endogenous Smad3 in these cells compromises SBE1-mediated transcription in response to activin A and interferes with its ability to positively regulate follistatin mRNA levels. The findings of the current work illustrate the critical role of intron 1 of the follistatin gene in mediating Smad-dependent effects of activin and regulating the expression level of this gene in some cell types, such as pituitary cells of gonadotrope lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2040020512,"Contests mediate access to reproductive opportunities in almost all species of animals. An important aspect of the evolution of contests is the reduction of the costs incurred during intra-specific encounters to a minimum. However, escalated fights are commonly lethal in some species like the honeybee, Apis mellifera. By experimentally reducing honeybee queens' fighting abilities, we demonstrate that they refrain from engaging in lethal contests that typically characterize their reproductive dominance behavior and coexist peacefully within a colony. This suggests that weak queens exploit an alternative reproductive strategy and provides an explanation for rare occurrences of queen cohabitation in nature. Our results further indicate that self-assessment, but not mutual assessment of fighting ability occurs prior to and during the agonistic encounters."

These associations were studied in a population-based, cross-sectional study of 1680 middle-aged Dutch women, using linear regression analysis. The minor allele C of the rs1528133 SNP was significantly associated with increased weight (+1.88 kg, P = 0.022) and BMI (+0.56 units, P = 0.05). Compared with non-carriers, both AG heterozygotes and AA homozygotes of the rs2272382 SNP derived less energy from fat (AG: -0.55+/-0.28%, P = 0.05, AA: -0.95+/-0.48%, P = 0.047). However, both genotypes were associated with an increased energy intake from carbohydrates (0.69+/-0.33%, P = 0.04 and 1.68+/-0.56%, P = 0.003, respectively), mainly because of a higher consumption of mono- and disaccharides. Both these SNPs, rs2272382 and rs1528133, were also associated with a higher glycemic load in the diet. The glycemic load was higher among those with AG and AA genotypes for the variant rs2272382 than among the wild types (+1.49 (95% CI: -0.27-3.24) and +3.89 (95% CI: 0.94-6.85) units, respectively). Carriers of the minor allele C of rs1528133 were associated with an increased glycemic load of 1.85 units compared with non-carriers.Genetic variation of the TUB gene was associated with both body composition and macronutrient intake, suggesting that TUB might influence eating behavior."

JunD is a major component of the AP-1 complex following liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury; however, its precise function in this setting remains unclear. We investigated the functional significance of JunD in regulating AP-1 transcription following partial lobar I/R injury to the liver, as well as the downstream consequences for hepatocellular remodeling. Our findings demonstrate that JunD plays a protective role, reducing I/R injury to the liver by suppressing acute transcriptional activation of AP-1. In the absence of JunD, c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation in response to I/R injury were elevated, and this correlated with increased caspase activation, injury, and alterations in hepatocyte proliferation. The expression of dominant negative JNK1 inhibited c-Jun phosphorylation, AP-1 activation, and hepatic injury following I/R in JunD–/– mice but, paradoxically, led to an enhancement of AP-1 activation and liver injury in JunD+/– littermates. Enhanced JunD/JNK1-dependent liver injury correlated with the acute induction of diphenylene iodonium-sensitive NADPH-dependent superoxide production by the liver following I/R. In this context, dominant negative JNK1 expression elevated both Nox2 and Nox4 mRNA levels in the liver in a JunD-dependent manner.

Both of these phases result in organ damage, and both appear to involve the production of abnormal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Therefore, modulating oxidative stress responses in transplanted organs has traditionally been considered as a rational approach to decreasing the complications associated with I/R damage.The AP-1 transcription complex is widely recognized as an important redox-activated factor involved in I/R liver injury. The family of AP-1 transcription factors consists of three main groups: the Jun proteins (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), the Fos proteins (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2), and the activating transcription factors (ATF2, ATF3, and B-ATF) (11Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Members of these families can form homodimers or heterodimers that make up the active AP-1 complex. In addition to the regulation of AP-1 complexes by their dimer protein composition, post-translational modifications that alter the DNA binding and transactivation abilities of these complexes play important roles in controlling their activity (12Sheerin A.

Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar).Previous studies have shown that I/R injury promotes the activation of JNK1, as well as the induction of AP-1 DNA binding complexes composed of Jun heterodimers, during the reperfusion phases of injury (16Uehara T.

In the context of liver I/R injury, hepatocytes undergo temporally regulated proliferation in a bimodal fashion, as evident from peaks in PCNA expression during the acute and subacute phases of reperfusion injury (23Schlossberg H. Zhang Y. Dudus L. Engelhardt J.F. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1546-1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether these observed changes in cellular proliferation are coordinated by AP-1 transcriptional activity.In this study, we sought to address the role of AP-1 transcriptional activation following hepatic I/R injury by monitoring the expression of an AP-1-responsive luciferase reporter in vivo. Additionally, we wanted to better understand the functional significance of c-Jun/JunD heterodimers in the liver following I/R injury. Results from these studies demonstrate that JunD deletion significantly enhances hepatic transcriptional activation of AP-1 following I/R, and these changes correlated with enhanced cellular proliferation and increased liver injury. The expression of dominant negative JNK1 (dnJNK1) in the liver prior to I/R significantly altered the temporal pattern of AP-1 transcriptional activation, hepatic injury, and NADPH-dependent superoxide production by the liver in a JunD-dependent manner. These findings suggest that JNK1 and JunD collaborate to control NADPH-regulated redox stress in the liver following I/R and that these changes may influence AP-1 transcriptional programs that determine hepatocellular fates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMouse Model of Partial Lobar I/R Injury—JunD knock-out mice used in this study were described previously (24Thepot D. Weitzman J.B. Barra J. Segretain D. Stinnakre M.G. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 143-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The JunD knock-out mice were bred onto a C57BL/6J background for 3–5 generations during the course of rederival into a specific pathogen-free barrier facility and maintained by breeding heterozygous JunD+/– males with knock-out JunD–/– females. Because these mice were not inbred, all experimental comparisons were performed with littermates from the colony (offspring from the mating scheme gave rise to litters composed of ∼50% heterozygous and ∼50% knock-out mice). Of note, male JunD–/– mice had reduced fertility and were not used for breeding. Male JunD+/– mice were compared with JunD–/– littermates in partial lobar liver I/R experiments as described previously (25Zwacka R.M. Zhou W. Zhang Y. Darby C.J. Dudus L. Halldorson J. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In brief, mice were anesthetized and injected with heparin (100 μg/kg) to prevent clotting of blood during lobar ischemia. The largest medial lobe of the liver was clamped at its base with a micro-aneurysm clamp, followed by placement of the liver and clamp back into the peritoneal cavity for 45 or 60 min. Following surgically implemented ischemia, the clamp was removed and the abdominal wall sutured, and the animals were returned to their cages. Removal of the clamp signified the start of reperfusion. The ischemic lobe of livers were harvested at 0, 6, 9, 12, 18, and/or 24 h after the initiation of reperfusion for experimental analysis.Gene Delivery to the Liver Using Recombinant Adenovirus—Recombinant adenoviruse vectors Ad.LacZ (25Zwacka R.M.

Biol. 2003; 23: 3052-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) were described previously. Ad.AP-1Luc virus was generated using a fragment from the pAP1(PMA)-TA-Luc plasmid (Clontech) containing the firefly luciferase gene, driven by six tandem copies of the AP1 enhancer linked to the minimal TATA box promoter from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. An XhoI/NotI fragment from pAP1(PMA)-TA-Luc was inserted into a promoterless adenoviral shuttle plasmid (pAd5mcspA), and Ad.AP-1Luc virus was generated by homologous recombination as described previously (25Zwacka R.M.

Davidson B.L. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Viral infections with Ad.LacZ and Ad.dnJNK1 were performed 3 days before liver I/R surgery, by tail vein injection with 1011 particles of purified virus per 25 g of body weight in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Ad.AP-1Luc infections were performed at a lower dose of 5 × 1010 particles per 25 g of body weight.Western Blot Analysis—Ischemic liver lobes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then homogenized in 2 ml of homogenization buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mm KCl, 0.74 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) for 50 ml). 100 μg of protein was separated on a denaturing 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. PCNA and p53 protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis using anti-PCNA and anti-p53 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Analysis of c-Jun phosphorylation was performed by immunoprecipitation of c-Jun from 1 mg of ischemic liver lobe lysate followed by Western blotting with a phosphoserine 63 c-Jun-specific antibody. Both the pan c-Jun (catalog number sc-45) and p-c-Jun(Ser-63) (catalog number sc-822) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Westerns blots were quantified on a LI-COR Biosciences Odyssey Infrared Imaging System using infrared-labeled secondary antibody.Luciferase Indicator Assays for AP-1 Transcriptional Activation—AP-1 transcriptional activity in the ischemic lobe of the liver was assessed using an Ad.AP-1Luc vector. 100 μg of total protein from each liver lysate was used to perform luciferase assays. Luciferase activity was measured using a kit from Promega (Madison, WI).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays for AP-1 DNA Binding—Nuclear extracts were generated from the ischemic lobe of the liver as described previously (25Zwacka R.M. Zhou W. Zhang Y. Darby C.J. Dudus L. Halldorson J. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Protein content was measured using a Bradford assay, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described previously with little modification (17Zhou W. Zhang Y. Hosch M.S. Lang A. Zwacka R.M. Engelhardt J.F. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 902-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, 6 μl of nuclear extract was incubated in EMSA buffer (250 mm KCl, 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol) with bovine serum albumin (1 μg/μl), poly(dI-dC) (1 μg/μl) and double-stranded, 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide (200,000 cpm) in a total volume of 20 μl. This mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature before being separated on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel. The oligonucleotide sequence used for the AP-1 double-stranded probe was 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′.Serum GPT Assay for Liver Damage—Blood was collected from animals at the time of liver harvest at various times post-reperfusion. Blood samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 8,000 rpm to separate the serum from the cells. Serum transaminase (GPT) levels were measured using a microkinetic assay (2–6 μl of serum) as described previously (25Zwacka R.M. Zhou W. Zhang Y. Darby C.J. Dudus L. Halldorson J. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).Isolation of Liver Endomembranes and Chemiluminescence Assays for NADPH-dependent Superoxide (O2·¯) Production— Liver tissue (ischemic lobe of the liver) was lysed in the homogenization buffer described above by nitrogen cavitation. 600 μg of crude lysate was then centrifuged at 3,000 × g to remove the heavy mitochondria and nuclei, and the post-nuclear supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to pellet total endomembranes. The membranes were washed three times in homogenization buffer before being resuspended in 100 μl of homogenization buffer. NADPH oxidase activities were analyzed by measuring the rate of O2·¯ generation using a chemiluminescent, lucigenin-based system as described previously (28Li Q. Harraz M.M. Zhou W. Zhang L.N. Ding W. Zhang Y. Eggleston T. Yeaman C. Banfi B. Engelhardt J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 140-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 μm lucigenin in 50 μl of each endomembrane fraction was used to calculate the relative rate of O2·¯ production following the addition of β-NADPH at a final concentration of 100 μm, with or without 10 μm diphenylene iodonium (DPI).Quantification of Nox Transcripts—JunD+/– and JunD–/– mice were infected with 1.0 × 1011 particles (intravenously) of either Ad.LacZ or Ad.dnJNK 3 days prior to harvesting the livers. Total RNA was purified from the liver using a standard guanidine thiocyanate solution and ultracentrifugation CsCl2 banding procedure. Poly(A) mRNA was purified from the total mRNA using the Micro-FastTract 2.0 mRNA mini kit (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed on the mRNA samples using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) with random priming and a reaction volume of 100 μl. Reverse transcriptase negative samples were also carried along as a control for mRNA specificity in the PCR. Each sample was evaluated by real time PCR for Nox2, Nox4, and β-actin mRNA copies. For the three respective amplification reactions a Nox2, Nox4, and β-actin master mix was generated (per reaction: 10 μl of iQ SYBR Green Supermix, 375 nm primer 1, 375 nm primer 2, in a total volume of 16 μl). The primers used were as follows: Nox2, 5′-ACGCCCTTTGCCTCCATTCTCAAGTC-3′ and 5′-ATGCGTGTCCCTGCACAGCCAGTAG-3′; Nox4, 5′-TTCGAGGATCACAGAAGGTCCCTAGCA-3′ and 5′-GGCGGCTACATGCACACCTGAGAAA-3′; and β-actin, 5′-CCTGAACCCTAAGGCCAACCGTGAAA-3′ and 5′-TACGACCAGAGGCATACAGGGACAGCA-3′.16 μl of a given master mix and 4 μl of a cDNA sample were combined for each reaction. For each cDNA sample, three replicate real time reactions were prepared using each of the three sets of primers, for a total of nine reactions per liver sample. Additionally, to accurately quantify copy number, a series of standards were created using known copies numbers of Nox2, Nox4, and β-actin plasmids. Samples were run on a Bio-Rad MyIQ real time machine (step 1, heat at 95 °C for 2 min; step 2, 45 cycles alternating between 95 °C for 30 s and 71 °C for 15 s). Ct values for each reaction were used to calculate copy number of each cDNA transcript against the standard curves. Finally, the copy number of each Nox transcript was normalized to the copy number of the β-actin internal control. This normalization controlled for slight variations in the quality/quantity of each cDNA preparation used in each PCR.RESULTSJunD Modulates AP-1 Transcriptional Activation following Liver I/R Injury—Following I/R injury to the liver, increased nuclear DNA binding activity by AP-1 heterodimers composed of c-Jun and JunD occurs within the first 3 h of reperfusion (17Zhou W. Zhang Y. Hosch M.S. Lang A. Zwacka R.M. Engelhardt J.F. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 902-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Zwacka R.M. Zhou W. Zhang Y. Darby C.J. Dudus L. Halldorson J. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Using a recombinant adenoviral vector encoding an AP-1 responsive luciferase gene, we sought to determine the transcriptional status of AP-1 following liver I/R. In light of these previous findings, we were surprised to find that maximal AP-1 transcriptional activation in JunD+/– animals occurred at 12 h after the initiation of hepatic reperfusion (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, JunD-deficient littermates demonstrated significantly earlier onset (6–9 h) and enhanced (more than 3-fold) AP-1 transcriptional induction (Fig. 1A), suggesting that JunD suppresses the transcriptional activity of the AP-1 complex during the early stages of reperfusion injury. Comparative analysis in these animals demonstrated an inverse relationship between DNA binding by AP-1 (Fig. 1B) and in vivo transcriptional activation mediated by AP-1. In both JunD+/– and JunD–/– animals, DNA binding by AP-1 complexes exhibited a bimodal distribution, peaking at 3–6 h, diminishing at intermediate time points and rising again by 18–24 h. Thus, maximal transcriptional activation by AP-1, which occurred at 12 h post-reperfusion, correlated with a decline in AP-1 binding activity. We interpret these results to suggest that AP-1-mediated transcription following I/R undergoes both activating and inhibitory stages. During the activating stages (3–6 h), similar levels of DNA binding were seen in JunD-deficient and control animals, supporting the notion that the AP-1 complex was more active for transcription in the absence of JunD. Furthermore, JunD ablation led to an earlier and accentuated reduction in nuclear AP-1 DNA binding during the refractory stage when DNA binding activity is inhibited (9–12 h).JunD Protects the Liver from Injury following I/R—To determine the consequences of AP-1 activation in the liver following I/R injury and to investigate the role of JunD in this process, we evaluated the extent of liver injury by measuring serum transaminase (GPT) levels. These studies revealed significantly greater I/R liver injury in JunD-deficient mice as compared with heterozygous littermates, when the animals underwent 45 min of ischemia (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, when longer times of ischemia were used (1 h), lethality in JunD–/– mice within the first 90 min of reperfusion was significantly increased above that of JunD+/– littermates (Fig. 2B). This increased liver injury, as well as increased lethality, following liver I/R injury in the JunD–/– animals correlated with an elevation of caspase activity in liver homogenates during the early stages (6 h) of reperfusion (Fig. 2C). In JunD+/– littermates, by contrast, caspase activation in response to I/R treatment peaked much later (18 h post-reperfusion) and was attenuated in comparison with that seen in the JunD knock-out mice. In summary, these findings demonstrate that in the absence of JunD, enhanced AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation during the acute stage of reperfusion correlates with increased liver damage.FIGURE 2JunD protects against I/R-induced liver injury and alters hepatocellular remodeling. JunD–/– and JunD+/– mice were subjected to I/R injury, with partial lobar hepatic ischemia taking place for 45 min (A, C, and D) or 60 min(B), followed by the indicated times of reperfusion. A, serum samples were collected by cardiac puncture at the indicated time points following the start of reperfusion and assayed for GPT. Results depict the mean (±S.E.) units/liter of GPT for n = 4 animals in each group. B, survival of mice following 60 min of ischemia was plotted using a Kaplan-Meier survival curve, p < 0.0004. C, caspase 3/7 activity in whole cell lysates from liver was determined using a caspase-Glo detection kit, for which a substrate emits light when cleaved by either caspase 3 or 7. Results depict the mean (±S.E.) relative light units (RLU). D, for each experimental point, pooled liver lysates from three animals were evaluated for PCNA and p53 expression by Western blotting (WB). The 0-h time point in A, C, and D represents the respective values (serum glutathione S-transferase, caspase 3/7 activity, or PCNA/p53 levels) for non-I/R injured control animals (i.e. noninjured base-line values).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)JunD Alters Hepatocellular Responses following I/R Injury—JunD has been shown to slow cell cycle progression by inhibiting the G1-to-S phase transition (18Pfarr C.M.

J. 2007; 403: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previous studies on I/R injury to the liver have also demonstrated that PCNA expression (an index of cellular proliferation) is tightly regulated during the early stages of reperfusion injury, as indicated by its bi-modal expression pattern (23Schlossberg H. Zhang Y. Dudus L. Engelhardt J.F. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1546-1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the lack of JunD expression might alter cell cycle progression during the acute stages of I/R injury and thereby lead to impaired hepatic repair (remodeling) mechanisms. Analysis of JunD+/– animals reproduced the previously described bi-modal expression of PCNA (23Schlossberg H. Zhang Y. Dudus L. Engelhardt J.F. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1546-1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with peaks at 3 and 18 h post-reperfusion (Fig. 2D). In contrast, this I/R-induced bi-modal response was dysregulated in mice lacking JunD, remaining elevated up to 12 h following reperfusion. Furthermore, JunD knock-out mouse livers expressed PCNA at elevated base-line levels in the absence of I/R injury (Fig. 2D, 0 h time points), indicating a pre-existing dysregulation of the cell cycle. These findings suggest that JunD does indeed alter cell cycle regulation in the liver, both prior to and following I/R injury. However, despite previous studies in fibroblasts demonstrating that JunD can act through p53 to modulate growth arrest and DNA repair (19Weitzman J. Fiette L. Matsuo K. Yaniv M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1109-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we did not observe significant differences in p53 levels between the two JunD genotypes (Fig. 2D).The JNK Pathway Influences JunD-dependent AP-1 Transcriptional Activity following I/R Injury to the Liver—JNK plays a major role in regulating AP-1 activity by phosphorylating c-Jun on serine 63/73 (29Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, JunD has been shown to be a substrate of JNK phosphorylation (30Yazgan O. Pfarr C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29710-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but the functional consequences of this event remain largely unknown. Acute JNK1 activation occurs within the first 45–60 min following liver I/R and precedes the induction of nuclear AP-1 binding to DNA (17Zhou W. Zhang Y. Hosch M.S. Lang A. Zwacka R.M. Engelhardt J.F. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 902-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Chemical inhibitors of JNK appear to suppress DNA binding by AP-1 following I/R injury, and they have been shown to protect the liver from apoptotically mediated damage (16Uehara T. Bennett B.

To this end, we hypothesized that expressing dominant negative JNK1 using a recombinant adenoviral vector (26Qiao L. Han S.I. Fang Y. Park J.S. Gupta S. Gilfor D. Amorino G. Valerie K. Sealy L.

Female and male isoforms (DSXF and DSXM) are formed due to sex-specific RNA splicing. DNA recognition, mediated by a shared N-terminal zinc module (the DM domain), is enhanced by a C-terminal dimerization element. Sex-specific extension of this element in DSXF and DSXM leads to assembly of distinct transcriptional preinitiation complexes. Here, we describe the structure of the extended C-terminal dimerization domain of DSXF as determined by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The core dimerization element is well ordered, giving rise to a dense network of interresidue nuclear Overhauser enhancements.

Sexual differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by the X:autosome ratio and a sex-specific RNA-splicing pathway (Fig. 1A) (1Cline T.W. Meyer B.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 637-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). A principal target is doublesex (dsx); expression of male- and female-specific transcription factors (DSXM and DSXF) in turn directs most aspects of somatic sexual differentiation (2Burtis K.C. Baker B.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 997-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The DSX isoforms are encoded by mRNAs sharing the first three exons; the C-terminal segment of DSXF is encoded by exon 4, whereas that of DSXM is encoded by exons 5 and 6. Male and female isoforms are thus identical for the first 397 residues but differ thereafter (Fig. 1B) (2Burtis K.C. Baker B.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 997-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). DSXM and DSXF share two recognized domains, an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (3Erdman S.E. Burtis K.C.

Because the sex-specific region begins at residue 398 (Gly in DSXF and Ala in DSXM), mutations in exons 4-6 affect either DSXF (exon 4, encoding residues 398-427) or DSXM (exons 5 and 6, encoding residues 398-546). XX females homozygous for G398D, for example, are intersexual, whereas males are unaffected, since exon 5 is unchanged (3Erdman S.E. Burtis K.C.

Genetics. 1996; 144: 1639-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mediates both strong dimerization (Kd < 1 nm) and the sex-specific recruitment of an obligatory partner protein, Intersex (IX) (12Garrett-Engele C.M. Siegal M.L. Manoli D.S. Williams B.C. Li H. Baker B.S. Development. 2002; 129: 4661-4675PubMed Google Scholar). Such recruitment has provided a biochemical basis for observations that (i) the intersex gene (ix) interacts genetically with dsxF but not dsxM (13Baker B.S. Ridge K.A. Genetics. 1980; 94: 383-423PubMed Google Scholar, 14Waterbury J.A. Jackson L.L. Schedl P. Genetics. 1999; 152: 1653-1667PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) mutations in ix cause an intersexual phenotype in XX:AA ix-null flies (15Morgan T.H. Redfield H. Morgan L.V. Yearbook Carnegie Institution, Washington. 1943; 42: 171-174Google Scholar) that is identical to that of XX:AA dsx-null flies. Such corresponding phenotypes make it unlikely that IX interacts with targets other than DSXF. The ix gene encodes a protein of 188 amino acids (12Garrett-Engele C.M. Siegal M.L. Manoli D.S. Williams B.C. Li H. Baker B.S. Development. 2002; 129: 4661-4675PubMed Google Scholar) that is homologous to a component of the mammalian Mediator transcriptional co-activation complex (16Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Banks C.A.S. Parmely T.J. Sorokina I. Brower C.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49671-49674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whereas IX lacks recognizable motifs of DNA binding, its N-terminal region is also homologous to Caenorhabditis elegans SUR-2 (encoded by suppressor of ras) and to the SYT class of human synovial sarcoma translocation proteins; the latter can function as transcriptional co-activators in in vitro assays. Heterologous expression of insect and mammalian homologs of ix in transgenic flies provides evidence that its functional interactions with DSXF are (at least in part) conserved (17Siegal M.L. Baker B.S. Dev. Genes Evol. 2005; 215: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although IX is expressed in both female and male flies, it has no known function in males. The molecular basis of the sex-specific recruitment of IX by DSXF is not well understood but is presumably mediated by the female-specific C-terminal domain (CTDF). To investigate the structural basis of DSXF dimerization and IX recruitment, we have determined the structure of CTDF and explored its function by mutagenesis. Because this domain appears to be refractory to crystallization (18Bayrer J. Wan Z. Li B. Weiss M.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), heteronuclear multidimensional NMR methods were employed to define its ordered substructure and delineate disordered segments. A dense network of interresidue nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) was defined by three- and four-dimensional edited NMR spectroscopy; intra- and intermolecular contacts were distinguished by asymmetric isotopic labeling (19Weiss M.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 86: 626-632Google Scholar, 20Lee W. Revington M.J. Arrowsmith C. Kay L.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 21Arrowsmith C. Pachter R. Altman R. Jardetzky O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The structure of the constituent UBA-like folds and their mode of dimerization in solution are similar to features observed in the crystal structure of a dimeric fragment comprising residues 350-412 (CTDF-pΔ) (8Bayrer J.R. Zhang W. Weiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32989-32996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The female-specific portion of CTDF-p (residues 398-427) in part extends the C-terminal α-helix of the UBA fold (residues 350-408) but is otherwise disordered (residues 409-427). Deletion analysis and Ala-scanning mutagenesis collectively demonstrate that IX binding is mediated by the proximal helical portion of the female tail. The dimer interface of CTDF is remarkable for an electrostatic network of salt bridges and charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds braced by underlying nonpolar side chains. Two temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations at this interface have been characterized in yeast model systems. These mutations may provide in vivo probes to enable studies of sex-specific transcriptional regulation in D. melanogaster with application to developmental neurogenetics. Bacterial Expression and Isotopic Labeling—Uniformly 13C- and 15N-double-labeled domains CTDF-p (residues 350-427) and CTDF-pΔ (residues 350-412) were expressed as thrombin-cleavable fusion proteins (8Bayrer J.R. Zhang W. Weiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32989-32996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in modified M9 minimal medium containing 3 g/liter 13C-glucose, and 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl as sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The polypeptides each contained an additional N-terminal dipeptide (GS) derived from the vector. A 50-ml overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of minimal medium; the starting cell density exhibited an absorbance value of 0.15 at 600 nm (A600). When aerobic bacterial growth reached an A600 value of 0.5 following shaking at 37 °C at 250 rpm, protein overexpression was induced for 6 h by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopy-ranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6370 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet (from 4 liters of culture) was resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 250 mm NaCl and 60 μg/ml lysozyme. Cell lysis was affected by French press at least twice. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,100 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a cobalt resin column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 250 mm NaCl. The DSX fusion protein was eluted with 150 mm imidazole and cleaved by thrombin. Final purification of the DSX domains was accomplished by gel filtration chromatography using an Amersham Biosciences Superdex-75 column. The protein was >98% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE; molecular masses were verified by mass spectrometry. NMR Methods—Protein samples were prepared in nitrogen-purged H2O solution (7% D2O) containing 10 mm 2H-Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) and 250 mm NaCl in a 300-μl Shigemi NMR tube; the protein concentration was in each case ∼1.5 mm. One-, two-, and three-dimensional NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C at 700 MHz using a triple resonance probe and a shielded (x, y, z)-gradient unit; four-dimensional 13C/13C NOESY spectra were acquired at 600 MHz. Spectra were in each case processed with the program nmrPipe (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and analyzed with pipp (23Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional NMR triple-resonance spectra (HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, C(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, and HNCO experiments) were acquired to enable complete main-chain and side-chain resonance assignments (24Bax A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 738-744Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 25Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 201-207Google Scholar, 26Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Crossref Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Stereospecific assignments were obtained by analysis of approximate intraresidue and sequential interresidue distances involving NH, CαH, and CβH protons, as derived from three-dimensional 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY spectra with short mixing times (35 ms) to avoid spin diffusion (27Powers R. Garrett D. March C.J. Frieden E.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 32: 6744-6762Google Scholar). Three NOESY spectra (three-dimensional 13C-separated NOESY-HSQC, three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY-HSQC, and four-dimensional 13C/13C-edited NOESY) were used to derive distance restraints. Three-dimensional 13C-edited (F3)/15N, 13C-filtered (F1) experiments were used to extract intermolecular NOEs between labeled and unlabeled protomers in a solution containing a 1:1.5 ratio of labeled and unlabeled domains (28Ikura M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 2433-2440Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 29Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J.F. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 711-721Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Four-dimensional 13C/13C-edited NOESY was employed to identify additional dimer-related NOEs. Structure Calculations and Molecular Modeling—An ensemble of structures was calculated using a hybrid distance-geometry dynamic simulated annealing method (30Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 31Omichinski J.G. Pedone P.V. Felsenfeld G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) using the National Institutes of Health version of XPLOR (32Brünger A.T. XPLOR Version 3.1 Manual.

Initial structures were calculated by employing only unambiguous NOEs; calculations were iteratively performed on further NOE analysis. Assigned intra- and intermolecular NOEs were classified as strong, medium, weak, and very weak, corresponding to respective interproton distance restraints of 1.8-2.7 Å (1.8-2.9 Å for NOEs involving NH protons), 1.8-3.3 Å (1.8-3.5 Å for NOEs involving NH protons), and 1.8-5.0 Å and 1.8-6.0 Å (34Williamson M.P. Havel T.F. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 295-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 35Clore G.M. Nigles M. Sukumaran D.K. Brünger A.T. Karplus M. Gronenborn A.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2729-2735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Restraints on main-chain Φ and ψ torsion angles were generated using TALOS (36Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar), in which minimum error ranges were set to ±20 (Φ) and ±30 (ψ) from the average predicted value (37Caffrey M. Cai M.L. Kaufman J.

Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4399-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The structure of CTDF-pΔ was calculated based on 3057 NOE distance restraints, including 418 long range restraints and 275 contacts between protomers across the dimer interface. The structure of CTDF-p was obtained using 2847 NOE restraints. Ramachandran plots were calculated to examine the quality of the final structures using PROCHECK (39Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Models were visualized using InsightII and molmol software (40Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29-32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—Site-directed substitutions were introduced by PCR-based two-stage overlap extension mutagenesis as described (8Bayrer J.R. Zhang W. Weiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32989-32996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Random mutations were introduced by error-prone PCR, generating a DNA fragment spanning the CTDF coding region. Protocols for PCR amplification and subcloning have been described (41Zhang W. Li B. Singh R. Narendra U. Zhu L. Weiss M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Yeast Assays—Dimerization of CTDF was probed using the Matchmaker GAL4 Y2H system (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). For Y2H library screening, pGBKT7-CTDF wild-type and pGADT7-CTDF variants were co-transformed into yeast strain Y187 by the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method. Interactions were monitored on SD/-Leu/-Trp-selective plates supplemented with 80 μg/ml X-gal. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 7 days. White colonies were picked and spotted on new selective plates, incubated at 20 °C until new colonies appeared. Plasmid DNA from blue colonies was recovered by PCR and sequencing. Interactions were otherwise characterized using a quantitative β-galatosidase enzymatic assay (see below). Specific DSXF-DNA binding was probed using a MATCHMAKER Y1H system (BD Clontech) in which lacZ is regulated by a 48-bp fragment of the DSX-responsive fbe (fat body enhancer in Drosophila yolk protein genes yp1 and yp2) containing binding sites dsxA and dsxB (42Burtis K.C. Coschigano K.T. Baker B.S. Wensink P.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2577-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The design and validation of this system have previously been described (41Zhang W. Li B. Singh R. Narendra U. Zhu L. Weiss M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Expression levels of DSX fusion proteins were verified in each case by Western blot using anti-GAL4 antiserum (Upstate Group, Charlottesville, VA). DSXF-IX Interactions—The sex-specific interaction of DSXF and IX was probed by two assays developed by Baker and co-workers (12Garrett-Engele C.M. Siegal M.L. Manoli D.S. Williams B.C. Li H. Baker B.S. Development. 2002; 129: 4661-4675PubMed Google Scholar). (i) Initial studies employed a Y2H system in which the bait plasmid expressed a fusion protein containing the specific DNA-binding domain (DBD) of GAL4 linked to DSXF, DSXM, or respective fragments containing C-terminal deletions; the prey plasmid expressed the GAL4 activation domain (AD) linked to IX. In each construct, specific independent DNA binding by the DM domain of the DSX fusion proteins was blocked by the mutation R91Q to avoid toxicity (3Erdman S.E. Burtis K.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Yeast transformants (strain AH109) were grown at 30 °C on selective plates containing the His3 competitive inhibitor 3-AT. Under these conditions, little or no growth is observed in control studies of the DSXM fusion proteins. To identify determinants of IX binding, Ala-scanning mutagenesis of CTDF was conducted in this context. Ala substitutions were tested for effects on interaction with IX by Y2H as described above. (ii) Structure-activity relationships inferred from Y2H studies were verified by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of recombinant tagged IX and DSXF proteins from Drosophila S2 nuclear extracts (12Garrett-Engele C.M. Siegal M.L. Manoli D.S. Williams B.C. Li H. Baker B.S. Development. 2002; 129: 4661-4675PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected S2 cells were grown at 25 °C, and nuclear extracts were obtained and analyzed at 4 °C. Wild-type or variant DSX isoforms were expressed as V5 epitope-tagged constructs, whereas IX was co-expressed as hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged constructs. Full-length IX, DSXM, DSXF, and DSXF deletion variant coding sequences were subcloned in frame into the pAc5.1/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen). To generate HA-tagged pAc5.1-IX expression vector, an HA epitope was added to the N terminus of IX sequence by PCR. Constructs were verified in each case by DNA sequencing. Cells were transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear extract kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). 100-μl nuclear extracts were incubated with 2-μg polyclonal anti-HA antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional 3 h. The beads were collected and gently washed threes times with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by immunoblotting with a mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Enzyme Assays—Liquid state o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactose assays were performed according to the vendor's protocol (BD Clontech). Results (given in Miller's units) represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate experiments (43Oh D.B. Kim Y.G. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16666-16671Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our study has three parts. We first undertook the heteronuclear NMR analysis of CTDF-p and its dimeric fragment CTDF-pΔ. This analysis permits comparison of the solution structure of the extended domain with the crystal structure of the fragment, in turn enabling characterization of the female-specific tail. We next investigated the role of the tail in IX binding by deletion analysis and Ala-scanning mutagenesis. Finally, we employed random- and site-directed mutagenesis to probe the dimer interface. Yeast models were exploited to identify ts mutations at this interface, which may be of future value as genetic probes. Solution Structure of DSX CTDF—NMR spectra of CTDF-p exhibit residue-specific spin systems corresponding to the number of residues in a protomer, indicating that the dimer is symmetric; within the dimer, any exchange between asymmetric conformations must be fast on the time scale of NMR chemical shifts. Despite the presence of two prolines (Pro370 and Pro375), minor conformations characteristic of cis-trans isomerization were not observed. 1H-15N HSQC “fingerprint” spectra of the 15N-labeled domains are superimposed in Fig. 2. The spectrum of CTDF-p contains additional cross-peaks that are poorly resolved near random coil chemical shifts. Patterns of chemical shifts are otherwise similar in the two spectra, indicating a correspondence of structures within respective UBA folds. Complete sequential assignment was in each case obtained. Analysis of Secondary Structure—Trends in the secondary chemical shifts of Hα, Cα, and Cβ resonances, together with diagnostic NOE patterns, indicate that CTDF-p contains three long α-helices (76% of the sequence): Gln353-Lys366 (α1), Trp371-Asn383 (α2), and Ile388-Gln408 (α3). These helices each exhibit large positive secondary Cα shifts, negative secondary Cβ shifts, and strong or medium strength NOEs between amide protons within the helix (HN(i, i + 1) and HN(i, i + 3) contacts in Wüthrich format (44Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1986: 117-174Google Scholar). Although such NOE patterns can sometimes be observed in nascent (but not stably folded) helical segments, observation of the accompanying canonical helix-associated 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts indicates that these elements of secondary structure are well ordered. NMR-defined helical end points in CTDF-p are in accord with the crystal structure of CTDF-pΔ (8Bayrer J.R. Zhang W. Weiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32989-32996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Long Range and Dimer-related NOEs—Analysis of tertiary structure requires assignment of long range contacts, which are predominantly between α-helices. Unambiguous assignment requires dimer-related NOEs to be distinguished from intramolecular NOEs. The latter are critical for determining the folding of individual protomers, whereas intermolecular NOEs aid in characterizing the dimer interface. The pattern of long range and dimer-related NOEs is in overall accord with the crystal structure; representative three- and four-dimensional NOESY spectra are provided as supplemental material. Of particular interest are two anomalous NOE cross-peaks involving in one dimension the side-chain HNϵ resonance of Arg394 at 8.55 ppm and in the other dimension respective resonances at 6.45 and 6.84 ppm (Fig. 3B). By elimination, the latter resonances cannot be due to aromatic, main-chain amide, or side-chain carboxyamide protons. These anomalous NOE cross-peaks are asymmetric, indicating that the unassigned resonances at 6.45 and 6.84 ppm are broader than that of Arg394 HNϵ. Four corresponding NOE cross-peaks are likewise observed in the 13C-edited NOESY spectrum involving the Arg394 CδH2 methylene group (Fig. 3A). We hypothesize that these resonances belong to the Arg394 NH2 side-chain guanidinium moieties, which are seldom observable in proteins due to rapid solvent exchange. The two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of CTDF-pΔ contains five cross-peaks in the chemical shift range characteristic of exchangeable Arg side-chain resonances (Fig. 3C). Four are assigned to Arg HNϵ resonances, whereas the additional cross-peak at 6.84/72.00 ppm is likely to be an Arg NH2 guanidinium resonance. We speculate that an electrostatic network, including charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds, protects this resonance from solvent exchange, enabling its observation (see “Discussion”). Mobility of C-terminal Tail—Whereas the initial residues of the female-specific tail of CTDF-p (residues 350-427) extend α-helix α3 of the UBA fold (see above), the remainder of the tail is disordered. Evidence of disorder is provided by four sets of observations. First, resonances in the C-terminal tail exhibit motional narrowing relative to resonances in the UBA folds. Such differences in line"
https://openalex.org/W2059551269,"Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes play roles in a diversity of processes including Drosophila phototransduction. In fly photoreceptor cells, the PLCβ encoded by norpA is critical for activation of TRP channels. Here, we describe a PLCβ regulator, STOPS, which encodes a SOCS box protein. Mutation of stops resulted in a reduced concentration of NORPA and a defect in stopping signaling following cessation of the light stimulus. NORPA has been proposed to have dual roles as a PLC- and GTPase-activating protein (GAP). We found that the slow termination resulting from expressing low levels of wild-type NORPA was suppressed by addition of normal amounts of an altered NORPA, which had wild-type GAP activity, but no PLC activity. STOPS is the first protein identified that specifically regulates PLCβ protein concentration. Moreover, this work demonstrates that a PLCβ derivative that does not promote TRP channel activation, still contributes to signaling in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2166108664,"Background Bacillus anthracis is the bacterium responsible for causing anthrax. The ability of B. anthracis to cause disease is dependent on a secreted virulence factor, lethal toxin, that promotes survival of the bacteria in the host by impairing the immune response. A well-studied effect of lethal toxin is the killing of macrophages, although the molecular mechanisms involved have not been fully characterized. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we demonstrate that celastrol, a quinone methide triterpene derived from a plant extract used in herbal medicine, inhibits lethal toxin-induced death of RAW264.7 murine macrophages. Celastrol did not prevent cleavage of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1, a cytosolic target of the toxin, indicating that it did not inhibit the uptake or catalytic activity of lethal toxin. Surprisingly, celastrol conferred almost complete protection when it was added up to 1.5 h after intoxication, indicating that it could rescue cells in the late stages of intoxication. Since the activity of the proteasome has been implicated in intoxication using other pharmacological agents, we tested whether celastrol blocked proteasome activity. We found that celastrol inhibited the proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins in RAW264.7 cells, but only slightly inhibited proteasome-mediated cleavage of fluorogenic substrates in vitro. Furthermore, celastrol blocked stimulation of IL-18 processing, indicating that celastrol acted upstream of inflammasome activation. Conclusions/Significance This work identifies celastrol as an inhibitor of lethal toxin-mediated macrophage lysis and suggests an inhibitory mechanism involving inhibition of the proteasome pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2027391273,"The protein kinase Chk1 is an essential component of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Chk1 is phosphorylated and activated in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe when cells are exposed to agents that damage DNA. Phosphorylation, kinase activation, and nuclear accumulation are events critical to the ability of Chk1 to induce a transient delay in cell cycle progression. The catalytic domain of Chk1 is well-conserved amongst all species, while there are only a few regions of homology within the C-terminus. A potential pseudosubstrate domain exists in the C-terminus of S. pombe Chk1, raising the possibility that the C-terminus acts to inhibit the catalytic domain through interaction of this domain with the substrate binding site.To evaluate this hypothesis, we characterized mutations in the pseudosubstrate region. Mutation of a conserved aspartic acid at position 469 to alanine or glycine compromises Chk1 function when the mutants are integrated as single copies, demonstrating that this domain of Chk1 is critical for function. Our data does not support, however, the hypothesis that the domain acts to inhibit Chk1 function as other mutations in the amino acids predicted to comprise the pseudosubstrate do not result in constitutive activation of the protein. When expressed in multi-copy, Chk1D469A remains non-functional. In contrast, multi-copy Chk1D469G confers cell survival and imposes a checkpoint delay in response to some, though not all forms of DNA damage.Thus, we conclude that this C-terminal region of Chk1 is important for checkpoint function and predict that a limiting factor capable of associating with Chk1D469G, but not Chk1D469A, interacts with Chk1 to elicit checkpoint activation in response to a subset of DNA lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1980164215,"Recent studies have sought to describe HIV infection and transmission characteristics around the world. Identification of early HIV-1 infection is essential to proper surveillance and description of regional transmission trends. In this study we compare people recently infected (RI) with HIV-1, as defined by Serologic Testing Algorithm for Recent HIV Seroconversion (STARHS), to those with chronic infection.Subjects were identified from 2002-2004 at four testing sites in São Paulo. Of 485 HIV-1-positive subjects, 57 (12%) were defined as RI. Of the participants, 165 (34.0%) were aware of their serostatus at the time of HIV-1 testing. This proportion was statistically larger (p<0.001) among the individuals without recent infection (n = 158, 95.8%) compared to 7 individuals (4.2%) with recently acquired HIV-1 infection. In the univariate analysis, RI was more frequent in <25 and >59 years-old age strata (p<0.001). The majority of study participants were male (78.4%), 25 to 45 years-old (65.8%), white (63.2%), single (61.7%), with family income of four or more times the minimum wage (41.0%), but with an equally distributed educational level. Of those individuals infected with HIV-1, the predominant route of infection was sexual contact (89.4%), with both hetero (47.5%) and homosexual (34.5%) exposure. Regarding sexual activity in these individuals, 43.9% reported possible HIV-1 exposure through a seropositive partner, and 49.4% reported multiple partners, with 47% having 2 to 10 partners and 37.4% 11 or more; 53.4% of infected individuals reported condom use sometimes; 34.2% reported non-injecting, recreational drug use and 23.6% were reactive for syphilis by VDRL. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were most vulnerable according to the multivariate analysis.In this study, we evaluated RI individuals and discovered that HIV-1 has been spreading among younger individuals in São Paulo and preventive approaches should, therefore, target this age stratum."

The best-studied posttranslational modification is phosphorylation, with well-known kinases and phosphatases regulating the function and stability of clock proteins. Degradation of these proteins usually involves ubiquitylation or sumoylation, and some of the relevant E3 ligases are known. In addition, Hirayama et al. recently identified acetylation as a clock regulatory mechanism. Circadian clock proteins are modified in many different ways. The best-studied posttranslational modification is phosphorylation, with well-known kinases and phosphatases regulating the function and stability of clock proteins. Degradation of these proteins usually involves ubiquitylation or sumoylation, and some of the relevant E3 ligases are known. In addition, Hirayama et al. recently identified acetylation as a clock regulatory mechanism. Circadian rhythms of behavior and physiology are driven by clocks located in a myriad of tissues. While the clocks controlling behavior tend to be in tissues of neuronal origin, those that regulate metabolism and other aspects of physiology are usually found in peripheral tissues. Regardless of the location, the underlying mechanisms that generate these clocks are basically the same and are even conserved across species. Thus, a typical model for a clock depicts a transcription-based feedback loop in which clock proteins rhythmically regulate expression of their own mRNAs, thereby maintaining cycles of gene expression. However, the simplicity of this basic model is increasingly being questioned, and, perhaps not surprisingly, molecular clocks are turning out to be quite complex. In the major clock feedback loop in Drosophila, the period and timeless proteins (PER and TIM) negatively regulate transcription of their own genes by inhibiting the activity of transcriptional activators, CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC). A similar loop operates in mammals where the period and cryptochrome proteins (PER1, PER2, CRY1, CRY2) inhibit the activity of Clock, or the Clock paralog NPAS2, and BMAL1 (ortholog of CYC). The major tweaks to this original model comprise the addition of posttranslational events that are critical for the timekeeping process (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Indeed, experimental manipulations indicate that rhythms can be generated when the cycling of some clock mRNAs or even some clock proteins is blocked (Fan et al., 2007Fan Y. Hida A. Anderson D.A. Izumo M. Johnson C.H. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, a 24 hr rhythm of clock protein activity is probably maintained by posttranslational modifications. Remarkably, the cyanobacterial clock can be reconstituted in vitro with ATP and three proteins that drive a cycle of phosphorylation (Rust et al., 2007Rust M.J. Markson J.S. Lane W.S. Fisher D.S. O'Shea E.K. Science. 2007; 318: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In a eukaryotic clock, it may not be possible to dispense with rhythmic transcription altogether, but the control of protein stability and activity is clearly critical. The modifications that regulate clock proteins include phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, and, as recently reported, acetylation (see Figure 1). Since the first discovery that the Drosophila period protein (PER) is rhythmically phosphorylated, rhythmic phosphorylation has been describe for several clock proteins, and the relevant kinases have been identified in some cases (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Thus, casein kinase 1ɛ (CK1ɛ, called double-time or DBT in flies) and casein kinase 2 phosphorylate Drosophila PER and serve to destabilize it and promote its translocation to the nucleus, respectively. Likewise, mammalian PER1 and PER2 are destabilized through the action of CK1ɛ and CK1δ, which has activity similar to that of CK1ɛ (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutations in a human CK1δ gene and in a PER2 phosphorylation site affected by CK1 underlie circadian disturbances in some individuals with familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS) (Xu et al., 2007Xu Y. Toh K.L. Jones C.R. Shin J.Y. Fu Y.H. Ptacek L.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Casein kinase action is not restricted to the PER proteins in the circadian clock. DBT-mediated phosphorylation of Drosophila CLK decreases both its stability and its transcriptional activity. Because the phosphorylation of CLK is PER dependent, it has been proposed that PER represses transcription, in large part, by “delivering” DBT to CLK (Kim et al., 2007Kim E.Y. Ko H.W. Yu W. Hardin P.E. Edery I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5014-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a similar vein, mammalian PER appears to regulate the phosphorylation of CRY by CK1 (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). CK1 also phosphorylates BMAL1 and enhances its transcriptional activity. On the other hand, phosphorylation of BMAL1 by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) decreases transcription by BMAL1-CLOCK (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is another important clock kinase (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). As for CK1, a circadian function for GSK3 was first found in Drosophila, where it phosphorylates and promotes the nuclear entry of TIM. GSK3 also acts on Drosophila cryptochrome (CRY), which in flies serves primarily as a circadian photoreceptor, and destabilizes it (Stoleru et al., 2007Stoleru D. Nawathean P. Fernandez Mde L. Menet J.S. Ceriani M.F. Rosbash M. Cell. 2007; 129: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The activity of mammalian GSK3 reportedly cycles and may regulate the daily degradation of CRY2 and the nuclear entry of PER2. In addition, GSK3 phosphorylates a component of a second mammalian loop that regulates the expression of BMal1 (a similar loop in Drosophila regulates the expression of Clk). Transcription of BMal1 is activated by Rora and repressed by Rev-Erbα, both of which are, in turn, rhythmically activated by BMAL1. Rev-Erbα is phosphorylated, and surprisingly stabilized, by GSK3; Rev-erbα also binds heme, which may allow a point of contact between the clock and metabolic activity (Yin et al., 2007Yin L. Wu N. Curtin J.C. Qatanani M. Szwergold N.R. Reid R.A. Waitt G.M. Parks D.J. Pearce K.H. Wisely G.B. Lazar M.A. Science. 2007; 318: 1786-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In addition, to kinases, phosphatase action is important for clock function. In fact, at least in Drosophila, it may be the phosphatases that account for the rhythm in phosphorylation of PER. Both PER and TIM are dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A and protein phosphatase 1, with the former promoting stability and nuclear localization and the latter affecting only stability. TIM, which appears to be the primary substrate for PP1, affects PP1 activity on PER, suggesting a mechanism by which TIM stabilizes PER (Fang et al., 2007Fang Y. Sathyanarayanan S. Sehgal A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1506-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PP1 also functions in the mammalian clock where it stabilizes expression of mPER2 (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, neither PP1 nor the kinases that phosphorylate PER-TIM are known to cycle. On the other hand, regulatory subunits of PP2A, in particular one named tws, cycle with a robust circadian rhythm in Drosophila. Because PP2A also acts on CLK, it may more generally underlie rhythms of clock protein phosphorylation. Another phosphatase implicated in mammalian rhythms is protein phosphatase 5, which acts on CK1ɛ and is itself regulated by an interaction with CRY (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Thus, clock complexes may contain a number of kinases and phosphatases that likely regulate each other in addition to directly modifying clock proteins. The destabilizing effect of phosphorylation often results from the phosphorylated protein being a target for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The PER proteins are targeted for proteasomal degradation by an F box containing E3 ubiquitin ligase termed Slimb in Drosophila and β-transducin repeat-containing protein (b-TRCP) in mammals (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative mutants of Slimb also affect levels of TIM under free-running conditions (constant darkness). In addition, TIM is targeted for degradation in response to light by an F box containing E3 ligase called jet-lag (Koh et al., 2006Koh K. Zheng X. Sehgal A. Science. 2006; 312: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Because this regulation of TIM is required for the entrainment of behavioral rhythms to light, lack of JET disrupts TIM degradation and also behavioral resetting. The mammalian CRY proteins are also degraded in a timely fashion by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Multiple, independent approaches recently revealed that CRY stability is regulated by an F box containing E3 ligase. These approaches consisted of genetic screens carried out in two laboratories and a biochemical approach designed to identify substrates of the afore-mentioned F box protein, Fbxl3 (Busino et al., 2007Busino L. Bassermann F. Maiolica A. Lee C. Nolan P.M. Godinho S.I. Draetta G.F. Pagano M. Science. 2007; 316: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, Godinho et al., 2007Godinho S.I. Maywood E.S. Shaw L. Tucci V. Barnard A.R. Busino L. Pagano M. Kendall R. Quwailid M.M. Romero M.R. et al.Science. 2007; 316: 897-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, Siepka et al., 2007Siepka S.M. Yoo S.H. Park J. Song W. Kumar V. Hu Y. Lee C. Takahashi J.S. Cell. 2007; 129: 1011-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Mutant forms of Fbxl3 isolated in genetic screens for semidominant or recessive mutations were termed after hours (Afh) or overtime (Ovtm), respectively. The mutant phenotypes, of long period free-running rhythms, are generally consistent with the biochemical indications that Fbxl3 targets CRY for degradation. The stability of at least one clock protein is affected by the covalent linkage of SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier protein). BMAL1 is SUMOylated rhythmically in a CLOCK-dependent manner, although the relevant E3 SUMO ligase has not been identified. A mutation in the sumoylation site increases the half-life of BMAL1 and, in addition, eliminates oscillations and circadian function of the protein (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The most recent modification to be described for clock proteins is acetylation. Prior to the demonstration that clock proteins may themselves be acetylated, the Sassone-Corsi laboratory showed that CLOCK functions as a histone acetyl transferase (HAT) (Doi et al., 2006Doi M. Hirayama J. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2006; 125: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). While histones are methylated during the repression phase of the circadian cycle, activation of transcription by CLOCK-BMAL1 is associated with histone acetylation (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The finding that CLOCK itself is a HAT provides a possible explanation for how this acetylation occurs. In an extension of this work, Dr. Sassone-Corsi and colleagues sought to determine whether the acetyl transferase activity of CLOCK is also directed toward other clock proteins. In a recent paper in Nature, they report that BMAL1 is acetylated with a diurnal rhythm in the liver (Hirayama et al., 2007Hirayama J. Sahar S. Grimaldi B. Tamaru T. Takamatsu K. Nakahata Y. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Using cultured mammalian cells, they showed that acetylation of BMAL1 depends upon interaction with CLOCK and, in fact, requires HAT activity of CLOCK. On the other hand, CRY1 and PER2 did not affect BMAL1 acetylation. C-terminal deletions of BMAL1 showed that the relevant acetylation site is in the C terminus, where four possible acetylation sites (lysines) are found. Site-directed mutagenesis of one of these lysines (K537R) affected acetylation of BMAL1 in cultured cells and also in in vitro acetylation assays. Interestingly, this mutation also abolished the ability of BMal1 to rescue circadian expression of an mPer2-luciferase reporter in BMal1 knockout cells. However, mutation of a neighboring lysine (K538R) did not impair rescue, indicating that failure to rescue was not due to secondary structure defects caused by the lysine mutation. The next question then is the function served by acetylation. Hirayama et al. found that acetylation did not affect stability or subcellular localization or phosphorylation of BMAL1. Nor did it affect recruitment of BMAL1 to the mPer2 promoter or even the ability of BMAL1 to associate with CLOCK and activate transcription. What was affected was the interaction of BMAL1 with CRY and, thus, the repressive effect of CRY on transcriptional activity of BMAL1. Thus, the acetylation mutant was associated with constantly high levels of Per and Cry expression. The neighboring mutation (K538R) did not abolish interaction with CRY or CRY-mediated repression, indicating that the effect was specific for the acetylated lysine. It appears, therefore, that acetylation provides another level of control in negative feedback. The studies reported here monitored oscillations of acetylation in the liver and assayed effects of acetylation on rhythms in fibroblasts, which are a popular model for understanding molecular mechanisms of the clock. However, there are differences between peripheral clocks, which the liver and fibroblasts are examples of, and between central and peripheral clocks. For instance, the CLOCK protein is essential for function of some peripheral clocks, but loss of CLOCK does not affect central clock function, presumably because of redundancy with NPAS2 (Debruyne et al., 2007Debruyne J.P. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: R538-R539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). If the HAT activity of CLOCK, and its regulation of BMAL1, is a conserved clock mechanism, then one would expect NPAS2 to have the same activity. Undoubtedly, this will be determined in the near future. Along the same lines, it would be interesting to determine whether acetylation is a regulatory clock mechanism in other systems, e.g., Drosophila. Overall, what we're learning then is that clock proteins can be extensively modified. While some of these modifications are a critical part of the clock, others may serve to modulate the system, providing finer control over timekeeping and accounting for the precision of circadian function. In addition, these modifications may allow other pathways to interface with the circadian system, either to reset the clock or to be regulated in a circadian fashion.
