Here, we report increased dendritic spine density with reduced developmental spine pruning in layer V pyramidal neurons in postmortem ASD temporal lobe. These spine deficits correlate with hyperactivated mTOR and impaired autophagy. In Tsc2+/− ASD mice where mTOR is constitutively overactive, we observed postnatal spine pruning defects, blockade of autophagy, and ASD-like social behaviors. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin corrected ASD-like behaviors and spine pruning defects in Tsc2+/ mice, but not in Atg7CKO neuronal autophagy-deficient mice or Tsc2+/−:Atg7CKO double mutants.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by impaired social interactions, communication deficits, and repetitive behaviors. Multiple ASD susceptibility genes converge on cellular pathways that intersect at the postsynaptic site of glutamatergic synapses (Bourgeron, 2009Bourgeron T. A synaptic trek to autism.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, Peça and Feng, 2012Peça J. Feng G. Cellular and synaptic network defects in autism.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), implicating abnormalities in dendritic spines in ASD pathogenesis. Consistently, increased spine density is observed in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes in ASD brains (Hutsler and Zhang, 2010Hutsler J.J. Zhang H. Increased dendritic spine densities on cortical projection neurons in autism spectrum disorders.Brain Res. 2010; 1309: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) and changes in synaptic structure are detected in multiple ASD model mice (Zoghbi and Bear, 2012Zoghbi H.Y. Bear M.F. Synaptic dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders associated with autism and intellectual disabilities.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a009886Crossref Scopus (513) Google Scholar). It remains however unclear why spine pathology occurs and how it is associated with the onset and progression of ASD-related symptoms. Postnatal synaptic development in mammalian cerebral cortex is a dynamic process involving concurrent formation and elimination/pruning (Purves and Lichtman, 1980Purves D. Lichtman J.W. Elimination of synapses in the developing nervous system.Science. 1980; 210: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, Rakic et al., 1986Rakic P. Bourgeois J.P. Eckenhoff M.F. Zecevic N. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Concurrent overproduction of synapses in diverse regions of the primate cerebral cortex.Science. 1986; 232: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Synapse formation exceeds pruning at early ages, yielding excessive excitatory synapses essential for the assembly of neural circuits. Synaptic elimination subsequently outpaces formation, resulting in net spine pruning from childhood through adolescence. Consistently, the density of dendritic spines peaks in early childhood and is followed by a steep decline during late childhood and adolescence to adult levels (Penzes et al., 2011Penzes P. Cahill M.E. Jones K.A. VanLeeuwen J.E. Woolfrey K.M. Dendritic spine pathology in neuropsychiatric disorders.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), a process that provides selection and maturation of synapses and neural circuits. While ASDs exhibit striking genetic and clinical heterogeneity, multiple ASD syndromes are caused by mutations in genes that act to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, including Tsc1/Tsc2, NF1, and Pten (Bourgeron, 2009Bourgeron T. A synaptic trek to autism.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Synaptic mTOR integrates signaling from various ASD synaptic and regulatory proteins, including SHANK3, FMRP, and the glutamate receptors mGluR1/5 (Peça and Feng, 2012Peça J. Feng G. Cellular and synaptic network defects in autism.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Bourgeron, 2009Bourgeron T. A synaptic trek to autism.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Overactive mTOR signaling may produce an excess of synaptic protein synthesis, which could indicate a common mechanism underlying ASD. Synapses, however, must balance protein synthesis and degradation to maintain homeostasis and support plasticity (Bingol and Sheng, 2011Bingol B. Sheng M. Deconstruction for reconstruction: the role of proteolysis in neural plasticity and disease.Neuron. 2011; 69: 22-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). An important means for removing damaged organelles and degrading long-lived or aggregate-prone proteins is macroautophagy (autophagy hereafter), a process downstream of mTOR signaling that involves the formation of autophagosomes to capture and transport cytoplasmic components to lysosomes. The activation of mTOR inhibits autophagy at an early step in autophagosome formation (Kim et al., 2011Kim J. Kundu M. Viollet B. Guan K.L. AMPK and mTOR regulate autophagy through direct phosphorylation of Ulk1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (4513) Google Scholar). In support of a role for autophagy dysregulation in ASD etiology, a recent study identified ASD-associated exonic copy number variation mutations in genes coding for proteins involved in autophagic pathways (Poultney et al., 2013Poultney C.S. Goldberg A.P. Drapeau E. Kou Y. Harony-Nicolas H. Kajiwara Y. De Rubeis S. Durand S. Stevens C.

Genet. 2013; 93: 607-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Autophagy has been implicated in synaptic remodeling in C. elegans (Rowland et al., 2006Rowland A.M. Richmond J.E. Olsen J.G. Hall D.H. Bamber B.A. Presynaptic terminals independently regulate synaptic clustering and autophagy of GABAA receptors in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1711-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and Drosophila (Shen and Ganetzky, 2009Shen W. Ganetzky B. Autophagy promotes synapse development in Drosophila.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but a role in mammalian synaptic development is unexplored. We hypothesized that autophagy remodels synapse maturation downstream of mTOR, and autophagy deficiency downstream of overactivated mTOR contributes to ASD synaptic pathology. We found a higher spine density in basal dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons in ASD patients than in controls. The increased spine density was associated with a defect in net postnatal spine pruning that was correlated with hyperactivated mTOR and impaired autophagy. Using Tsc1/2 mutant ASD mice and Atg7CKO neuronal autophagy-deficient mice, we found that aberrant autophagy and mTOR hyperactivation underlies ASD-like synaptic pathology and correcting autophagy signaling could normalize developmental dendritic spine pruning defects and social behaviors. We measured dendritic spines of basal dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons in the superior middle temporal lobe, Brodmann Area 21 (BA21), a region implicated in ASD due to its participation in brain networks involved in social and communicative processes, including language, social and speech perception, auditory and visual processing, and comprehension of intentions (Redcay, 2008Redcay E.

Social concepts are represented in the superior anterior temporal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 6430-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Abnormalities in ASD temporal lobe have been confirmed by functional imaging and pathological studies, including disturbed gene transcription profiles (Garbett et al., 2008Garbett K. Ebert P.J.

Zhang H. Increased dendritic spine densities on cortical projection neurons in autism spectrum disorders.Brain Res. 2010; 1309: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and reduced functional specialization (Shih et al., 2011Shih P. Keehn B. Oram J.K. Leyden K.M. Keown C.L. Müller R.A. Functional differentiation of posterior superior temporal sulcus in autism: a functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging study.Biol. Psychiatry. 2011; 70: 270-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We compared dendritic spine morphology in ASD patients and controls (demographic data in Table S1 available online) using the Golgi-Kopsch technique. In the adolescent group, only males were examined to exclude effects of hormone status. No correlation was revealed between spine density and potential confounding factors, including postmortem interval (PMI), seizure history, cause of death, brain pH, or tissue storage (Table S2). As in previous studies (Harris et al., 1992Harris K.M. Jensen F.E. Tsao B. Three-dimensional structure of dendritic spines and synapses in rat hippocampus (CA1) at postnatal day 15 and adult ages: implications for the maturation of synaptic physiology and long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2685-2705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dendritic protrusions with the ratio of head/neck diameter >1 were classified as spines. The spines were characterized by a neck 0.9–3.0 μm long and a spine head diameter of 0.5–2.0 μm (Figures S1A and S1B). The average spine head diameter (p = 0.519) and spine length (p = 0.819) from individual neurons were similar in ASD patients and controls at all ages examined (Figures S1C and S1D). The mean net spine density per individual was significantly higher in ASD patients than in controls (Figures 1A and 1B : mean ± SD: 11.32 ± 1.23 spines/10 μm versus 8.81 ± 2.77 spines/10 μm, p = 0.017, two tailed t test). Linear regression of spine density with age indicated a substantially greater level of net spine pruning in controls (slope = −0.40 spines/10 μm/year, R2 = 0.93) than in ASD patients (slope = −0.19/10 μm/year, R2 = 0.55; difference from linear regression of controls, F = 9.4, p = 0.007) (Figure 1C). Due to the limited number of brain samples available, we grouped patients and controls into two age categories: childhood (2–9 years) and adolescence (13–20 years) (Figures 1D and 1E). Analysis revealed profound effects of both disease and age on spine density (p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA, effect of disease: F (1, 16) = 73.11, p < 0.001; effect of age: F (1, 16) = 145.7, p < 0.001; disease × age interaction: F (1, 16) = 28.35, p < 0.001). The spine density was slightly higher in childhood ASD patients than controls (mean ± SD: 12.32 ± 0.60 spines/10 μm in ASD cases versus 11.37 ± 0.68 spines/10 μm in controls) but markedly higher in adolescent ASD patients than controls (10.33 ± 0.74 spines/10 μm in ASD cases versus 6.24 ± 0.59 spines/10 μm in controls). From childhood through adolescence, dendritic spines decreased by ∼45% in control subjects but only by ∼16% in ASD patients (Figure 1E), demonstrating a developmental defect in net spine pruning in ASD. To test the hypothesis that mTOR-autophagy signaling is disturbed in ASD and associated with ASD spine pathology, we performed western blot analysis of phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR), total mTOR (t-mTOR), phospho-S6 (p-S6), total S6 (t-S6), and the autophagosome marker LC3 and p62 (Figures 2A and 2F ) in frozen BA21 brain samples from age-, gender-, and PMI- matched ASD patients and controls (demographic data in Table S3). To determine the relationship between mTOR activity and density of dendritic spines, we examined the protein levels of postsynaptic marker PSD95 and the presynaptic protein synapsin I (Figure 2A). No effects of PMI, cause of death, brain pH, or length of storage on protein levels were detected (Table S2). We observed a decrease in p-mTOR level with age in controls and higher p-mTOR level in ASD patients than in controls at 13–20 years (Figure 2B). We observed similar changes in p-S6, a reporter for mTOR activity (Figure 2C). PSD95 protein level was higher in controls aged 2–10 years than controls aged 13–20 years, consistent with normal developmental spine pruning. This decrease in PSD95 level with age was absent in ASD patients (Figure 2D), consistent with the lower spine pruning in ASD patients. The presynaptic marker synapsin I exhibited a near-significant decrease with age in controls but not in patients (Figure 2E). Levels of p-mTOR were correlated with PSD95 (Figure 2I), indicating that lower mTOR activity is associated with a higher dendritic spine density in children and adolescents. To determine whether impaired autophagy underlies the spine pruning deficit in human ASD, we characterized basal autophagy in postmortem tissue of the temporal lobe in patients with ASD. The level of LC3-II, a biomarker that indicates the abundance of autophagosomes, was significantly lower in ASD patients than controls throughout childhood and adolescence (Figures 2F and 2G), while the level of p62, a protein substrate for autophagy, was higher in both childhood and adolescent ASD patients than controls (Figures 2F and 2H). These data suggest a low level of basal autophagy in ASD temporal cortex throughout development. LC3-II and p62 protein levels were not correlated with any confounding factor for tissue preservation but were correlated with seizure activity (Table S2), a common feature of ASD. The impairment in autophagy in ASD patients was confirmed by immunolabel of LC3-positive puncta in BA21 layer V: the cellular area occupied by LC3 puncta and the integrated intensity of LC3 puncta were lower in pyramidal neurons from ASD patients than age-matched controls during both early childhood and adolescence (Figures S1E, S1F, and S1G). Decreased autophagy in cortical neurons was confirmed by the accumulation of autophagy substrates p62 and ubiquitin (Ub) (Figures S1H, S1I, and S1J) and is thus an early feature of ASD. Higher levels of p-mTOR in both control and patients with ASD were strongly associated with lower levels of LC3-II (Figure 2J), suggesting that the lower level of autophagy in ASD patients was attributable to high mTOR activity. Higher LC3-II levels were strongly associated with lower levels of PSD95 (Figure 2K). These data indicate that mTOR-dependent autophagy is negatively correlated with spine density in human brain during childhood and adolescence. We then investigated whether mTOR hyperactivation and resulting inhibition of autophagy causes ASD-like dendritic spine pathology in ASD animal models. We focused on mutations in genes encoding tuberous sclerosis complexes TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin), proteins that form a heterodimer that constitutively inhibits Rheb to inactivate mTOR (Ehninger and Silva, 2011Ehninger D. Silva A.J. Rapamycin for treating Tuberous sclerosis and Autism spectrum disorders.Trends Mol. Med. 2011; 17: 78-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mutations in both Tsc1 and Tsc2 cause mTOR hyperactivation and ASD-like behaviors in mice (Chévere-Torres et al., 2012Chévere-Torres I. Maki J.M. Santini E. Klann E.

Rapamycin reverses impaired social interaction in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Tsc2+/− mice however exhibit normal social preference in a three-chamber test (Ehninger et al., 2008Ehninger D. Han S. Shilyansky C. Zhou Y. Li W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Ramesh V. Silva A.J.

Psychiatry. 2012; 17: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) but deficient social interaction in a dyadic reciprocal social test (Sato et al., 2012Sato A. Kasai S. Kobayashi T. Takamatsu Y. Hino O. Ikeda K. Mizuguchi M. Rapamycin reverses impaired social interaction in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This discrepancy in social behaviors could be due to differences in testing protocols, the gender, the age, or genetic background of the testing mice. We thus characterized ASD-like social behaviors in P30–P35 adolescent male Tsc2+/− mice maintained in a B6/C57 background. We observed no motor defects or anxiety-like behaviors in open field (Figures S2A–S2F). In the novel object recognition test, Tsc2+/− mice spent less time exploring the novel object than their wild-type (WT) littermates, with no difference in time spent exploring the familiar object (Figure 3A). Tsc2+/− mice, however, did not exhibit ASD-like repetitive behaviors (Figure 3B). Sociability was assessed during a dyadic social interaction with a novel (noncagemate) mouse matched for sex and genotype (see Supplemental Information). Tsc2+/− mice spent less time sniffing the stimulus mouse (Figure 3C), indicating impaired social interactions. Social deficits were confirmed using a three-chamber social test. While Tsc2+/− mice showed a preference for interacting with a social target compared with nonsocial target (Figure 3D, left), the preference index (the ratio of time sniffing mouse versus nonsocial target) was decreased (Figure 3D, right). In the social novelty test, Tsc2+/− mice spent a similar amount of time sniffing both novel and familiar social targets (Figure 3E, left), with decreased preference index (the ratio of time sniffing a stranger mouse versus a familiar mouse; Figure 3E, right), indicating a reduced preference for social novelty. The density of dendritic spines in pyramidal neuron basal dendrites of layer V A1/S2 in temporal cortex, which is thought to be analogous to the primate primary auditory cortex (A1) and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) (Benavides-Piccione et al., 2002Benavides-Piccione R. Ballesteros-Yáñez I. DeFelipe J. Yuste R. Cortical area and species differences in dendritic spine morphology.J. Neurocytol. 2002; 31: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), was examined by DiOlistic labeling (Figure 3F). A higher spine density was found in adolescent Tsc2+/− mice than in WT (Figures 3G and 3H). The greater spine density in Tsc2+/− layer V cortex at P30 was confirmed by increased immunolabel for the presynaptic marker, synaptophysin, and the postsynaptic marker, PSD95 (Figures S2G and S2H). We also observed increased PSD95 and F-actin-labeled puncta along the dendrites of mature Tsc2+/− primary neuronal cultures (Figures S2I and S2J). Net spine pruning normally occurs in mice after the third postnatal week (Zuo et al., 2005Zuo Y. Yang G. Kwon E. Gan W.B. Long-term sensory deprivation prevents dendritic spine loss in primary somatosensory cortex.Nature. 2005; 436: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and so we compared spine densities between P19–P20 and P29–P30. If the lack of TSC and hyperactivation of mTOR led to spine overgrowth, an increase in spine density would be expected prior to spine pruning. DiOlistic labeling revealed similar numbers of spines at P19–P20 in Tsc2+/− and WT mice but far more spines in P29–P30 Tsc2+/− mice than in WT (Figures 3G and 3H). The soma size and basal dendritic tree complexity were similar in WT and Tsc2+/− mutants (Figure S3A). These results suggest that there is a period of massive spine pruning between the ages of P19–P20 and P29–P30 in WT but a lack of normal pruning in Tsc2+/− mice. Inhibition of mTOR by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of rapamycin showed no effects in WT controls (Figure S3B) but corrected the pruning defect in Tsc2+/− mutants to the control level. To confirm the effect of the Tsc deficiency on dendritic spine pruning, we used a Tsc1 conditional knockout mouse line (Tsc1CKO), in which the Tsc1 gene was depleted from pyramidal neurons in the forebrain by crossing Tsc1flox/flox mice to CamKII-Cre mice. As CamKII promoter-driven Cre recombination begins in layer II-III cortical pyramidal neurons at P19–P20 but is substantial in all cortical layers at P23–P30 (Figure S4A), the level of TSC1 is normal in deep cortical layers at the start of this time window for spine pruning and depleted thereafter (Figures S4B and S4C). This mouse line allows us to model an appropriate developmental period for evaluating roles for cell-autonomous effects of neuronal mTOR in the regulation of developmental spine pruning. At P19–P20, the density of spines in basal dendrites of A1/S2 layer V pyramidal neurons was equivalent for both Tsc1flox/flox control and Tsc1CKO mice (p > 0.05), but spines in control mice were significantly less dense than in Tsc1CKO mice at P29–P30 (p < 0.01, Figures 3I and 3J). Although soma size was slightly greater (15%) in P29–P30 Tsc1CKO pyramidal neurons, the number of primary basal dendrites was similar for control and Tsc1CKO mice (Figures S4D, S4E, and S4F). Rapamycin treatment did not affect spine density in Tsc1flox/flox control mice (Figure S5B), but corrected spine pruning in Tsc1CKO mice to control levels (Figures 3I and 3J), with no effect on basal dendritic branching. Thus, both Tsc1CKO and Tsc2+/− mutants showed a lack of efficient postnatal spine pruning, indicating that TSC inhibition of mTOR is required for postnatal spine pruning. The effects of TSC1 deletion on spine density in pyramidal neurons at P30 is consistent with those reported in vivo in Purkinje cells (Tsai et al., 2012aTsai P.T. Hull C. Chu Y. Greene-Colozzi E. Sadowski A.R. Leech J.M. Steinberg J. Crawley J.N. Regehr W.G. Sahin M. Autistic-like behaviour and cerebellar dysfunction in Purkinje cell Tsc1 mutant mice.Nature. 2012; 488: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). We then addressed whether autophagy remodels dendritic spines downstream of mTOR. We confirmed suppression of basal autophagy due to mTOR disinhibition in the Tsc mutant mouse brain by (1) a decrease in protein levels of LC3-II in Tsc2+/− cortex, which was normalized by rapamycin (Figure 4A); (2) an increase in the level of phospho-S6 (pS6), indicating mTOR hyperactivation, and a reduction in GFP-LC3 puncta, a fluorescent marker for autophagosomes, in cortical pyramidal neurons from Tsc2+/−: GFP-LC3 mice (Figure S5A), indicating impaired autophagy and rapamycin-normalized pS6 levels and numbers of GFP-LC3 puncta; (3) decreased immunolabel for endogenous LC3 in Tsc2+/− mutant primary neuronal cultures (Figure S5B); (4) an accumulation of autophagy substrates, including p62 (Komatsu et al., 2007aKomatsu M. Waguri S. Koike M. Sou Y.S. Ueno T. Hara T. Mizushima N. Iwata J. Ezaki J. Murata S. et al.Homeostatic levels of p62 control cytoplasmic inclusion body formation in autophagy-deficient mice.Cell. 2007; 131: 1149-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar), lipid droplets, and damaged mitochondria (Martinez-Vicente et al., 2010Martinez-Vicente M. Talloczy Z. Wong E. Tang G. Koga H. Kaushik S. de Vries R. Arias E. Harris S. Sulzer D. Cuervo A.M. Cargo recognition failure is responsible for inefficient autophagy in Huntington’s disease.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), in Tsc2+/− primary neuronal cultures (Figures S5B, S5C, S5D, and S5E); (5) accumulation of p62- and Ub- positive inclusions in pyramidal neurons in Tsc1CKO mouse brain (Figure S5F). We analyzed autophagy flux in Tsc2+/−:GFP-LC3 neurons in comparison to Tsc2 WT: GFP-LC3 neurons (Figure 4B). Cultured primary neurons were treated with bafilomycin (BafA1) and NH4Cl to inhibit lysosomal hydrolase and block autophagosome-lysosome fusion. We reasoned that if autophagy flux was impaired by mTOR hyperactivation, BafA1/NH4CL blockade of lysosomal degradation would produce a lower accumulation of autophagosomes in Tsc2+/− neurons than in WT. As expected, there was more accumulation of GFP-LC3 puncta in BafA1/NH4CL-treated WT neurons than Tsc2+/− neurons, confirming a failure of autophagosome induction in Tsc2+/− neurons (Figure 4B). Rapamycin (200 nM, 8 hr) normalized autophagosome formation in Tsc2+/− neurons. These findings support the hypothesis that basal neuronal autophagy is depressed due to mTOR hyperactivation in Tsc mutant ASD mouse models. To investigate whether neuronal autophagy deficiency produces ASD-like behaviors and dendritic spine pathology, we generated forebrain excitatory neuronal specific autophagy-deficient mice by crossing Atg7flox/flox mice to CamKIIa-cre mice. Atg7 is an E1-like activating enzyme required for autophagosome formation (Komatsu et al., 2006Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T. Murata S. Iwata J. Tanida I. Ueno T. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Loss of autophagy in the central nervous system causes neurodegeneration in mice.Nature. 2006; 441: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar). A deficit in autophagy was confirmed by western blot analysis of conjugated ATG5-12, p62, and LC3-II proteins (Figure 5A) and by immunolabel of p62 and ubiquitin (Ub) (Figures 5B and 6A), proteins that form aggregates after autophagy inhibition (Komatsu et al., 2006Komatsu M.

At P20 there were no differences in LC3-II and conjugated ATG5-12 levels between genotypes, although p62 levels were higher in Atg7flox/flox:CamKII-Cre (Atg7CKO) autophagy-deficient mice (Figure 5A). By P30, however, Atg7CKO mice exhibited less conjugated ATG5-12 and LC3-II protein and more p62 protein than the Atg7flox/flox controls. Atg7CKO mice displayed occasional p62/Ub-positive inclusions in pyramidal neurons at P20 and prominent p62/Ub-positive aggregates in layer II-III and layer V-VI pyramidal neurons at P30 (Figure 5B). The results confirm a loss of autophagy between P20 and P30 in cortical pyramidal neurons in Atg7CKO mice. Atg7C"
https://openalex.org/W1992684889,"During plant growth, dividing cells in meristems must coordinate transitions from division to expansion and differentiation, thus generating three distinct developmental zones: the meristem, elongation zone and differentiation zone. Simultaneously, plants display tropisms, rapid adjustments of their direction of growth to adapt to environmental conditions. It is unclear how stable zonation is maintained during transient adjustments in growth direction. In Arabidopsis roots, many aspects of zonation are controlled by the phytohormone auxin and auxin-induced PLETHORA (PLT) transcription factors, both of which display a graded distribution with a maximum near the root tip. In addition, auxin is also pivotal for tropic responses. Here, using an iterative experimental and computational approach, we show how an interplay between auxin and PLTs controls zonation and gravitropism. We find that the PLT gradient is not a direct, proportionate readout of the auxin gradient. Rather, prolonged high auxin levels generate a narrow PLT transcription domain from which a gradient of PLT protein is subsequently generated through slow growth dilution and cell-to-cell movement. The resulting PLT levels define the location of developmental zones. In addition to slowly promoting PLT transcription, auxin also rapidly influences division, expansion and differentiation rates. We demonstrate how this specific regulatory design in which auxin cooperates with PLTs through different mechanisms and on different timescales enables both the fast tropic environmental responses and stable zonation dynamics necessary for coordinated cell differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1988852424,"Protein machines are multi-subunit protein complexes that orchestrate highly regulated biochemical tasks. An example is the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a 13-subunit ubiquitin ligase that initiates the metaphase-anaphase transition and mitotic exit by targeting proteins such as securin and cyclin B1 for ubiquitin-dependent destruction by the proteasome. Because blocking mitotic exit is an effective approach for inducing tumour cell death, the APC/C represents a potential novel target for cancer therapy. APC/C activation in mitosis requires binding of Cdc20 (ref. 5), which forms a co-receptor with the APC/C to recognize substrates containing a destruction box (D-box). Here we demonstrate that we can synergistically inhibit APC/C-dependent proteolysis and mitotic exit by simultaneously disrupting two protein-protein interactions within the APC/C-Cdc20-substrate ternary complex. We identify a small molecule, called apcin (APC inhibitor), which binds to Cdc20 and competitively inhibits the ubiquitylation of D-box-containing substrates. Analysis of the crystal structure of the apcin-Cdc20 complex suggests that apcin occupies the D-box-binding pocket on the side face of the WD40-domain. The ability of apcin to block mitotic exit is synergistically amplified by co-addition of tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, a small molecule that blocks the APC/C-Cdc20 interaction. This work suggests that simultaneous disruption of multiple, weak protein-protein interactions is an effective approach for inactivating a protein machine."
https://openalex.org/W1993533483,"In several sensory pathways, input stimuli project to sparsely active downstream populations that have more neurons than incoming axons. Here, we address the computational benefits of expansion and sparseness for clustered inputs, where different clusters represent behaviorally distinct stimuli and intracluster variability represents sensory or neuronal noise. Through analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we show that expansion implemented by feed-forward random synaptic weights amplifies variability in the incoming stimuli, and this noise enhancement increases with sparseness of the expanded representation. In addition, the low dimensionality of the input layer generates overlaps between the induced representations of different stimuli, limiting the benefit of expansion. Highly sparse expansive representations obtained through synapses that encode the clustered structure of the input reduce both intrastimulus variability and the excess overlaps between stimuli, enhancing the ability of downstream neurons to perform classification and recognition tasks. Implications for olfactory, cerebellar, and visual processing are discussed."

Striatal projection neurons (MSNs) are divided into two main subpopulations according to their projection via the direct or indirect pathway (Alexander and Crutcher, 1990Alexander G.E.

We therefore used whole-cell striatal recordings in order to study synaptic responses to tactile and visual stimuli. We show that neurons throughout dorsal striatum respond to bilateral whisker stimulation in a type-dependent manner and that neurons in dorsomedial striatum perform multisensory integration. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from neurons in dorsolateral striatum (n = 59 neurons), dorsomedial striatum (n = 50 neurons), and layer V of S1 barrel field (n = 20 neurons). Of all recorded neurons (n = 129), 45 were stained and morphologically reconstructed (see Experimental Procedures), three of which were cortical pyramidal neurons and 42 were striatal neurons. Striatal neurons were located between 1,854 and 2,613 μm below the pia, and the average recording time for all neurons was 48 ± 20 min (minimum = 9 min, maximum = 100 min; n = 129). The striatal regions targeted for recordings were selected according to the existence of corticostriatal projections from primary somatosensory and visual cortices (S1 and V1, respectively) following anterograde tracing (see Experimental Procedures; Figures 1A, 1B, 3A , and 3B).

Kawaguchi Y. The origins of two-state spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations of neostriatal spiny neurons.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2397-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Striatal neurons, however, had longer up state durations than cortical neurons and rarely discharged action potentials, unlike cortical neurons, which discharged several APs during up states (Figure S4). The input resistance of recorded neurons was extracted using step current injections and was calculated separately for up and down states (Figures S4F, S4H, and S4I). Unlike cortical neurons, striatal neurons had higher input resistance at up states and at more depolarized membrane potentials (Figure S4F), suggesting that inward rectification in MSNs (Kita et al., 1984Kita T. Kita H. Kitai S.T. Passive electrical membrane properties of rat neostriatal neurons in an in vitro slice preparation.Brain Res. 1984; 300: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Nisenbaum and Wilson, 1995Nisenbaum E.S. Wilson C.J. Potassium currents responsible for inward and outward rectification in rat neostriatal spiny projection neurons.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4449-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is the dominant factor determining their input resistance as recorded at the soma, even in the presence of the synaptic barrages occurring during the UP states. In order to study bilateral sensory integration, we delivered brief air puffs to the whisker pads on both sides (see Experimental Procedures) and recorded subthreshold responses to ipsilateral, contralateral, and bilateral stimulation in dorsolateral striatal neurons. Using the same stimulation protocol, we compared the whisker-evoked responses in striatal MSNs to cortical regular spiking neurons (putative pyramidal cells) in layer 5 of the barrel cortex (Figures 1 and S2; Table 1). All recorded neurons responded to both ipsilateral and contralateral whisker stimulation (cortical n = 17; striatal MSNs n = 20). Sensory responses were classified according to those occurring during “Up” or “Down” states, including cases in which sensory stimulation triggered state transitions (Reig and Sanchez-Vives, 2007Reig R. Sanchez-Vives M.V. Synaptic transmission and plasticity in an active cortical network.PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e670Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Figure 1 and S2, respectively). Response onset delays were significantly longer for ipsilateral than contralateral whisker stimulation in both cortical and striatal neurons (BF ipsilateral: 25.11 ± 6.49 ms, contralateral: 13.32 ± 3.61 ms, p < 0.001, n = 17; dorsolateral striatum ipsilateral: 28.45 ± 6.94 ms, contralateral: 19.78 ± 3.42 ms, p < 0.001, n = 20) (Figure 1F). Corresponding differences were observed also for response peak latencies (BF ipsilateral: 71.13 ± 21.98 ms, contralateral: 37.75 ± 8.52 ms, p < 0.001, n = 17; striatum ipsilateral: 66.88 ± 26.07 ms, contralateral: 52.62 ± 15.82 ms, p < 0.01, n = 20) (Figure 1G). Onset and peak latencies in response to contralateral and bilateral stimulation were significantly shorter in cortical neurons (Figures 1F and 1G). Response amplitudes for both cortical and striatal neurons were always larger when occurring during down states than during up states (Figures 1H and S2F, respectively). Contralateral whisker stimulation evoked larger amplitudes than ipsilateral stimulation in both cortical and striatal neurons (cortex during down states, ipsilateral: 9.11 ± 3.41 mV, contralateral: 14.07 ± 5.67 mV, p < 0.001; striatum during down states, ipsilateral: 10.27 ± 3.27 mV, contralateral: 15.65 ± 6.90 mV, p < 0.01) (Figure 1H). However, when stimuli were delivered simultaneously to both sides, a significant increase in amplitude was observed in striatal responses but not in cortical ones (cortex bilateral: 15.72 ± 7.09 mV; striatum bilateral: 20.37 ± 6.52 mV, p < 0.05) (Figure 1H). The increase in amplitude in the striatal MSNs is also reflected in the slopes of responses to bilateral stimulation (Figure 1I), both suggesting a higher sensitivity to bilateral input in striatal MSNs than that observed in S1 layer 5 pyramidal cells. This difference could be explained by the higher temporal separation between ipsilateral and contralateral responses in cortical neurons compared to MSNs (response peak latency: cortex = 33.38 ± 21.46 ms; striatum = 14.26 ± 24.96 ms, p < 0.05, data not shown).Table 1Responses to Bilateral Whisker Stimulation Recorded in Striatal MSNs and Pyramidal Neurons in Layer 5 of the Barrel CortexIpsilateralContralateralBilateralUpDownUpDownUpDownOnset (ms)Cortex24.84 ± 5.7725.11 ± 6.4913.2 ± 3.613.32 ± 3.6115.85 ± 7.5513.38 ± 3.42Striatum28.84 ± 8.1428.45 ± 6.9419.62 ± 4.5919.78 ± 5.0918.76 ± 4.7519.78 ± 3.42Peak (ms)Cortex59.1 ± 18.6271.13 ± 21.9833.46 ± 8.337.75 ± 8.5232.84 ± 9.8535.07 ± 8.52Striatum57.6 ± 22.6566.88 ± 26.0846.38 ± 13.5552.62 ± 15.8244.13 ± 12.1543.17 ± 10.94Amplitude (mV)Cortex1.8 ± 2.179.11 ± 3.47.27 ± 3.914.07 ± 5.676.68 ± 4.0215.72 ± 7.09Striatum5.3 ± 2.9210.27 ± 3.278.83 ± 4.7815.65 ± 6.910.03 ± 5.6420.37 ± 6.52Normalized amplitudeCortex0.15 ± 0.180.7 ± 0.250.53 ± 0.191 ± 00.48 ± 0.221.12 ± 0.46Striatum0.38 ± 0.230.82 ± 0.490.58 ± 0.211 ± 00.69 ± 0.391.45 ± 0.5Slope (mV/ms)Cortex0.12 ± 0.060.23 ± 0.120.39 ± 0."

While the effect of neural activity on cerebral blood flow has been extensively studied, whether or not neural activity influences vascular patterning remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that neural activity promotes the formation of vascular networks in the early postnatal mouse barrel cortex. Using a combination of genetics, imaging, and computational tools to allow simultaneous analysis of neuronal and vascular components, we found that vascular density and branching were decreased in the barrel cortex when sensory input was reduced by either a complete deafferentation, a genetic impairment of neurotransmitter release at thalamocortical synapses, or a selective reduction of sensory-related neural activity by whisker plucking. In contrast, enhancement of neural activity by whisker stimulation led to an increase in vascular density and branching. The finding that neural activity is necessary and sufficient to trigger alterations of vascular networks reveals an important feature of neurovascular interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2166792446,"On September 2013 an attack on the Westgate mall in Kenya led to a four day siege, resulting in 67 fatalities and 175 wounded. During the crisis, Twitter became a crucial channel of communication between the government, emergency responders and the public, facilitating the emergency management of the event. The objectives of this paper are to present the main activities, use patterns and lessons learned from the use of the social media in the crisis. Using TwitterMate, a system developed to collect, store and analyze tweets, the main hashtags generated by the crowd and specific Twitter accounts of individuals, emergency responders and NGOs, were followed throughout the four day siege. A total of 67,849 tweets were collected and analyzed. Four main categories of hashtags were identified: geographical locations, terror attack, social support and organizations. The abundance of Twitter accounts providing official information made it difficult to synchronize and follow the flow of information. Many organizations posted simultaneously, by their manager and by the organization itself. Creating situational awareness was facilitated by information tweeted by the public. Threat assessment was updated through the information posted on social media. Security breaches led to the relay of sensitive data. At times, misinformation was only corrected after two days. Social media offer an accessible, widely available means for a bi-directional flow of information between the public and the authorities. In the crisis, all emergency responders used and leveraged social media networks for communicating both with the public and among themselves. A standard operating procedure should be developed to enable multiple responders to monitor, synchronize and integrate their social media feeds during emergencies. This will lead to better utilization and optimization of social media resources during crises, providing clear guidelines for communications and a hierarchy for dispersing information to the public and among responding organizations."

Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic techniques as quercetin (1), afzelin (2), quercitrin (3), trifolin (4), quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucoside (5), isorhamnetin 3-O-α-L-rhamnoside (6), hyperoside (7), vitexin (8) and rutin (9). All compounds were isolated from the leaves of Z. bungeanum for the first time. Five compounds (2, 4, 5, 6 and 8) were found for the first time in the genus Zanthoxylum. To learn the mechanisms underlying its health benefits, in vitro (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays) and in vivo (protective effect on Escherichia coli under peroxide stress) antioxidant activities of the nine flavonoids were measured. Quercetin and quercetin glycosides (compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) showed the highest antioxidant activity. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the -OH in 4′ position on the B ring and the -OH in 7 position on the A ring possessed high antioxidant activity; B ring and/or A ring with adjacent -OH groups could greatly increase their antioxidant ability. Also, due to the different structures of various flavonoids, they will certainly exhibit different antioxidant capacity when the reactions occur in solution or in oil-in-water emulsion. These findings suggest that Z. bungeanum leaves may have health benefits when consumed. It could become a useful supplement for pharmaceutical products and functional food ingredients in both nutraceutical and food industries as a potential source of natural antioxidants."

The ability to sense and respond to thermal stimuli is essential for an organism’s survival. Not surprisingly, adaptive evolution has led to the emergence of specialized temperature-sensing mechanisms enabling organisms to rapidly detect noxious temperature stimuli. In higher organisms, this role is performed by members of a specialized family of ion channels—the TRP channels (Clapham, 2003Clapham D.E. TRP channels as cellular sensors.Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar, Patapoutian et al., 2003Patapoutian A. Peier A.M. Story G.M. Viswanath V.

Members of this family of membrane proteins enable ions to flux across the membrane when stimulated by changes in temperature (Caterina et al., 1997Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M.

Recently, the calcium-activated chloride channel, a member of the TMEM 16 family of ion channels, has been shown to be involved in heat sensitivity and possibly nociception (Cho et al., 2012Cho H. Yang Y.D. Lee J. Lee B. Kim T. Jang Y. Back S.K. Na H.S. Harfe B.D. Wang F. et al.The calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin 1 acts as a heat sensor in nociceptive neurons.Nat.

Temperature dependence of fast and slow gating relaxations of ClC-0 chloride channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), are known to be strongly modulated by changes in temperature. Moreover, several pathological mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV) have been identified, which enhance the temperature dependence of the NaV channel activity (Dib-Hajj et al., 2008Dib-Hajj S.D. Yang Y. Waxman S.G. Genetics and molecular pathophysiology of Na(v)1.7-related pain syndromes.Adv. Genet. 2008; 63: 85-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, it raises an important question—is there a general mechanism that underlies temperature-dependent gating of channels? TRP channels have become model systems for studying temperature gating in part due to their biological role in detecting thermal stimuli and unusually high-temperature sensitivity. Approaches such as high-throughput mutagenesis (Grandl et al., 2008Grandl J. Hu H. Bandell M. Bursulaya B. Schmidt M. Petrus M. Patapoutian A.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1340-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been combined with functional measurements to identify parts of the protein that are involved in temperature-dependent gating. These studies, however, cannot discriminate between effects on the temperature sensor itself versus those on downstream elements involved in coupling putative thermosensors to the pore. In voltage-sensing or ligand-gated processes, it is possible to unequivocally determine the molecular nature of these sensors by observing gating charge movement or ligand binding directly. In contrast, the formidable technical challenge of calorimetrically measuring the heat associated with channel gating has seriously impaired the search of a physiological temperature-sensing domain. While it has been suggested that temperature-dependent gating in heat- and cold-sensing channels involves large-scale rearrangements in a specialized domain (Brauchi et al., 2004Brauchi S. Orio P.

Strikingly, TRPA1 in pit-bearing snakes is a heat-sensitive channel (Gracheva et al., 2010Gracheva E.O. Ingolia N.T. Kelly Y.M. Cordero-Morales J.F. Hollopeter G. Chesler A.T. Sánchez E.E. Perez J.C.

Tao X. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Atomic structure of a voltage-dependent K+ channel in a lipid membrane-like environment.Nature. 2007; 450: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). In structural biology, rational design serves as the benchmark for understanding the physical principles of protein folding and function. We hypothesize that a similar design approach may help illuminate the general molecular principles of temperature-dependent gating. Here, we redesigned a canonical voltage-gated ion channel, whose overall architecture is similar to TRP channel, into channels that are either gated by heat or cold. Our bottom-up design approach is based on the paradigm that solvation and desolvation of amino acids is associated with distinct changes in specific heat capacity (Privalov and Makhatadze, 1990Privalov P.L. Makhatadze G.I. Heat capacity of proteins. II. Partial molar heat capacity of the unfolded polypeptide chain of proteins: protein unfolding effects.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). By systematically varying the polarity of residues that are likely to undergo changes in solvent accessibility during the gating process, we were able to control the temperature sensitivity of channel gating. In addition, we illustrate how the principle of thermodynamic coupling amplifies temperature sensitivity when voltage-sensing gating charges are reduced. Together, our findings establish a molecular mechanism to understand how ion channels with similar overall form can sense heat and cold. A central characteristic of temperature modulated ion channels is that upon changing the temperature, their relative open-probability versus voltage (POV) relationships shift along the voltage axis. For heat sensing channels, such as TRPV1, the POV curves shift left when the temperature is increased (Voets et al., 2004Voets T. Droogmans G. Wissenbach U. Janssens A. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. The principle of temperature-dependent gating in cold- and heat-sensitive TRP channels.Nature. 2004; 430: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), reflecting that channel opening is energetically facilitated at elevated temperatures (Figure 1A, top). Conversely, for cold-sensing channels, such as TRPM8 (Figure 1A, bottom), increase in temperature makes it harder for the channels to open and causes rightward shifts in their POV curves (Brauchi et al., 2004Brauchi S. Orio P. Latorre R. Clues to understanding cold sensation: thermodynamics and electrophysiological analysis of the cold receptor TRPM8.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 15494-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, Voets et al., 2004Voets T. Droogmans G. Wissenbach U. Janssens A. Flockerzi V. Nilius B.

Protein folding studies show that exposure of the hydrophobic core of the protein to the aqueous media results in organization of water molecules in the first solvation shells (Makhatadze and Privalov, 1993Makhatadze G.I.

This process is also associated with changes in specific heat capacity (Baldwin, 1986Baldwin R.L. Temperature dependence of the hydrophobic interaction in protein folding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 191-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), which is what ultimately shapes the free-energy change versus temperature (ΔG versus T) profile of the folding/unfolding process. As shown in Figure 1B, nonzero “change in specific heat capacity” (ΔCP) of any arbitrary process results in the ΔG versus T profile becoming curved (Clapham and Miller, 2011Clapham D.E. Miller C.

The sign of ΔCP determines whether the profile is convex shaped or concave shaped, while its absolute value determines the degree of curvature (Figures S1A and S1B available online). Calorimetric studies show that solvation of hydrophobic residues is associated with a positive ΔCP, while that of polar/charged residues is associated with a negative ΔCP (Makhatadze et al., 1990Makhatadze G.I.

The Shaker KV channel has served as an exemplar ion channel, whose voltage-dependent gating has been extensively studied using electrophysiological (Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998Schoppa N.E.

Of primary interest to us was the fact that its gating is only slightly modulated by change in temperature (Rodríguez and Bezanilla, 1996Rodríguez B.M. Bezanilla F.

Upon lowering the temperature from 28°C to 8°C, the kinetics of activation and deactivation of its ionic currents is modestly decelerated (Figures S1C and S1B), its POV curve is right shifted by less than 5 mV, and there is a slight reduction in its steepness (Figure 1C). The relative insensitivity of the POV curve of the Shaker KV channel complemented with the availability of wealth of structural (Butterwick and MacKinnon, 2010Butterwick J.A. MacKinnon R.

Voltage-dependent conformational changes of the Shaker KV channel, underlying its transition between closed and open states, lead to changes in water accessibility in different parts of the protein (Jensen et al., 2010Jensen M.O.

We reasoned that substitution of key residues, in regions that undergo increased solvation when channels open, with hydrophobic residues will confer a positive ΔCP to the overall gating process, while polar residues at similar locations will confer a negative ΔCP. Although the individual contributions of polar residues to negative ΔCp may not be large, a decrease in the positive component will also make the net ΔCp associated with channel opening negative (see analysis in Supplemental Information). Such substitutions should thus sensitize voltage-dependent gating to changes in temperature but the temperature sensing phenotype (i.e., cold or heat sensing) will depend on the polarity of perturbation. Conversely, perturbations at sites that undergo desolvation during channel opening, should also sensitize to temperature, although hydrophobic and polar substitutions will now have an opposite impact on ΔCP. We chose to target sites within the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of the Shaker KV channel and perturb them to design a temperature-sensitive KV channel. Our choice of the VSD over the pore domain was prompted by two factors. First, accessibility studies of thiol-modifying reagents and protons to substituted cysteines and histidines, respectively, in the VSDs, complemented with computational models of hydrated VSDs, suggest the presence of water accessible crevices within the VSD (Figure 1D), which undergo structural reorganization when the channel opens (Li et al., 2014bLi Q.

Bezanilla F. A proton pore in a potassium channel voltage sensor reveals a focused electric field.Nature. 2004; 427: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Such processes are likely to be associated with changes in accessibility of residues in the VSD. Second, the VSD in general appears to be more resilient to perturbations than the pore domain as suggested by earlier studies that have reported that polar perturbations in the pore domain frequently compromises functional expression of channels (Hackos et al., 2002Hackos D.H. Chang T.H. Swartz K.J. Scanning the intracellular S6 activation gate in the shaker K+ channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The specific sites within the VSD to be perturbed in this study were chosen based on two considerations. We reasoned that polar sites buried within the proteinaceous core of the VSD are likely to be the primary determinants of water occupancy in the voltage-sensing crevices. To identify such sites, using the structure of the VSD of the KV1.2/2.1 paddle chimera, we computed the fractional buried surface area of each residue (Figure 1E). Residues for which the buried fractions were > 0.8 were classified as buried residues. Next, using a previously reported alignment of 360 KV channel sequences (Lee et al., 2009Lee S.Y. Banerjee A. MacKinnon R. Two separate interfaces between the voltage sensor and pore are required for the function of voltage-dependent K(+) channels.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e47Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we computed the polarity conservation index (PCI) of each of the sites in the VSD (see Experimen"
https://openalex.org/W2013546639,"One of the most powerful ways to test the function of a protein is to characterize the consequences of its deletion. In the past, this has involved inactivation of the gene by homologous recombination either in the germline or later through conditional deletion. RNA interference (RNAi) provides an alternative way to knock down proteins, but both of these approaches have their limitations. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has suggested another way to selectively inactivate genes. We have now tested this system in postmitotic neurons by targeting two well-characterized synaptic proteins, the obligatory GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor and the GluA2 subunit of the AMPA receptor. Expression of CRISPR/Cas9 in hippocampal slice cultures completely eliminated NMDA receptor and GluA2 function. CRISPR/Cas9 thus provides a powerful tool to study the function of synaptic proteins."

To better understand the role of tau-mediated effects on pathophysiology and global central nervous system function, we extensively characterized gene expression, pathology and behavior of the rTg4510 mouse model, which overexpresses a mutant form of human tau that causes Frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). We found that the most predominantly altered gene expression pathways in rTg4510 mice were in inflammatory processes. These results closely matched the causal immune function and microglial gene-regulatory network recently identified in AD. We identified additional gene expression changes by laser microdissecting specific regions of the hippocampus, which highlighted alterations in neuronal network activity. Expression of inflammatory genes and markers of neuronal activity changed as a function of age in rTg4510 mice and coincided with behavioral deficits. Inflammatory changes were tau-dependent, as they were reversed by suppression of the tau transgene. Our results suggest that the alterations in microglial phenotypes that appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease may be driven by tau dysfunction, in addition to the direct effects of beta-amyloid."
https://openalex.org/W2002432364,"Motor resonance mechanisms are known to affect humans' ability to interact with others, yielding the kind of ""mutual understanding"" that is the basis of social interaction. However, it remains unclear how the partner's action features combine or compete to promote or prevent motor resonance during interaction. To clarify this point, the present study tested whether and how the nature of the visual stimulus and the properties of the observed actions influence observer's motor response, being motor contagion one of the behavioral manifestations of motor resonance. Participants observed a humanoid robot and a human agent move their hands into a pre-specified final position or put an object into a container at various velocities. Their movements, both in the object- and non-object- directed conditions, were characterized by either a smooth/curvilinear or a jerky/segmented trajectory. These trajectories were covered with biological or non-biological kinematics (the latter only by the humanoid robot). After action observation, participants were requested to either reach the indicated final position or to transport a similar object into another container. Results showed that motor contagion appeared for both the interactive partner except when the humanoid robot violated the biological laws of motion. These findings suggest that the observer may transiently match his/her own motor repertoire to that of the observed agent. This matching might mediate the activation of motor resonance, and modulate the spontaneity and the pleasantness of the interaction, whatever the nature of the communication partner."

Chronic blockade of the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) leads to long-term maintenance of weight loss and reduction of dyslipidemia in experimental and human obesity. The molecular mechanism by which CB1R blockade reverses dyslipidemia in obesity has not yet been clarified. In this study, we showed that CB1R blockade with the systemic CB1R blocker rimonabant enhanced whole-body energy expenditure and activated brown adipose tissue (BAT), indicated by increased expression of genes involved in BAT thermogenesis and decreased lipid droplet size in BAT. This was accompanied by selectively increased triglyceride (TG) uptake by BAT and lower plasma TG levels. Interestingly, the effects on BAT activation were still present at thermoneutrality and could be recapitulated by using the strictly peripheral CB1R antagonist AM6545, indicating direct peripheral activation of BAT. Indeed, CB1R blockade directly activated T37i brown adipocytes, resulting in enhanced uncoupled respiration, most likely via enhancing cAMP/PKA signaling via the adrenergic receptor pathway. Our data indicate that selective targeting of the peripheral CB1R in BAT has therapeutic potential in attenuating dyslipidemia and obesity.—Boon, M. R., Kooijman, S., van Dam, A. D., Pelgrom, L.

We silenced Lon in RKO cells by constitutive or inducible expression of Lon shRNA. Lon-silenced cells displayed altered levels of 39 mitochondrial proteins (26% related to stress response, 14.8% to ribosome assembly, 12.7% to oxidative phosphorylation, 8.5% to Krebs cycle, 6.3% to β-oxidation, and 14.7% to crista integrity, ketone body catabolism, and mtDNA maintenance), low levels of mtDNA transcripts, and reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes (with >90% reduction of complex I).

However, DGAT1 inhibition might be expected to lead to accumulation of potentially harmful DAGs in the heart and other tissues. Humans with severe heart failure have a marked reduction in DGAT1 mRNA levels in the heart, and this reduction in DGAT1 could be the reason for DAG and ceramide accumulation (9.Chokshi A. Drosatos K.

To test whether the lipid abnormalities observed in severe human heart failure were due to changes in DGAT1 expression, we deleted Dgat1 in cardiomyocytes; these mice are denoted hDgat1−/−. Loss of Dgat1 in cardiomyocytes led to cardiomyopathy associated with accumulation of DAG and ceramides. We then performed experiments to correct this toxicity and found that enterocyte-specific deletion of DGAT1 (mice are denoted hiDgat1−/−) corrected the cardiac dysfunction as did treatment with a long acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, exenatide. These improvements were associated with reduced lipid uptake and decreased PKC activation in the hearts. Our data show that aberrant lipid metabolism found in human heart failure is a likely cause of further cardiac dysfunction. In addition, we show a possible new approach to treatment of lipotoxic diseases of the heart. Animal protocols were in compliance with accepted standards of animal care and were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Peking University Health Center Animal Unit. Male and female mice were used in experiments unless specifically indicated. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. MHC-Cre mice were obtained from Michael Schneider (formerly at Baylor University) (26.Agah R. Frenkel P.A. French B.A. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A.

Heart and intestinal DGAT1 knock-out animals (hiDgat1−/−) were from the mating of the hDgat1−/− mice with enterocyte-specific Dgat1−/− knock-out mice (16.Ables G.P. Yang K.J. Vogel S.

Mice were housed in a barrier facility with 12-h light/12-h dark cycles and had ad libitum access to chow diet (5053 PicoLab Rodent Diet 20, Purina Mills). Heart DGAT activity was measured in vitro using membrane fractions isolated from muscle using [14C]palmitoyl-CoA as described previously (28.Liu L. Zhang Y. Chen N. Shi X. Tsang B. Yu Y.H. Upregulation of myocellular DGAT1 augments triglyceride synthesis in skeletal muscle and protects against fat-induced insulin resistance.J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 1679-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricular heart muscle was homogenized in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin. One-fourth volume of 30% sucrose was added to the sample immediately following homogenization. The homogenization mixture was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was spun at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was homogenized and resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined using a protein assay reagent kit (Bio-Rad). DGAT1 activity in 10 µg of membrane protein was assayed using 200-µl reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, and 25 µm [14C]palmitoyl-CoA (0.3 µCi). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 5 min and stopped by lipid extraction, adding 0.75 ml of chloroform/methanol in a ratio of 2:1. After adding 0.375 ml of 1 mm H2SO4, 17 mm NaCl, the organic phase was removed and evaporated under a stream of N2. Lipids were dissolved in 20 µl of hexane and then analyzed by TLC using plates that were developed in hexane/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid in a ratio of 70:30:1 (v/v). Chromatographic bands containing TG were cut out after iodine staining and quantified by scintillation counting. Five- to 6-month-old male Dgat1flox/flox mice and hDgat1−/− mice were given saline or 40 µg/kg/day synthetic GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide (Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc.) injections subcutaneously twice daily for 4 weeks. DGAT1 inhibition studies were performed in 16-week-old male mice by oral gavage with 200 µl of vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, 0.1% polysorbate 80) or 5 mg/kg DGAT1 inhibitor (AstraZeneca) upon food removal at 8 am as described (16.Ables G.P. Yang K.J. Vogel S. Hernandez-Ono A. Yu S. Yuen J.J. Birtles S. Buckett L.K. Turnbull A.V. Goldberg I.J. Blaner W.S. Huang L.S. Ginsberg H.N.

Lipid Res. 2012; 53: 2364-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At 8-h postgavage, mice were euthanized, and tissues were collected for lipid measurement and RNA isolation. Sixteen-hour-fasted mice were first injected intravenously with 1 × 106 decays/min 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fifty-five minutes after 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose injection, 1 × 106 decays/min [14C]oleic acid complexed with 6% BSA was injected. Five minutes after oleic acid injection, blood was collected, and the vasculature was thoroughly perfused with 10 ml of PBS via cardiac puncture. Tissues were then excised, and accumulated radioactivity for [3H]glucose and [14C]oleic acid was measured via liquid scintillation counting. Data are expressed as the percentage of tissue counts/gram of tissue to plasma counts at 30 s (oleic acid) or 5 min (glucose). Blood samples were obtained from 6-h-fasted mice. Glucose was measured directly from the tail tip with a glucometer (ONETOUCH Ultra 2, Lifescan, Inc.). Blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus for the measurement of plasma total cholesterol and TG. Plasma total cholesterol and TG were measured enzymatically using an Infinity kit (Thermo Electron Corp.). To measure free fatty acid (FFA), TG, DAG, and ceramide, lipids were extracted from left ventricular cardiac muscle with chloroform/methanol/HCl (v/v/v, 2:1:0.01) (29.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Butylated hydroxytoluene (0.01%) was added in the extraction solution as an antioxidant, and [3H]triolein (0.25 µCi) was used as an internal control for TG recovery. TG and FFA concentrations in lipid extracts were determined enzymatically with colorimetric kits (Sigma-Aldrich). DAG and ceramide levels were measured using a DAG kinase assay method (30.Preiss J.E. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. Niedel J.E. Quantitative measurement of sn-1,2-diacylglycerols.Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Basically, lipids from muscle samples were dried under a stream of N2, redissolved in 7.5% octyl β-d-glucoside containing 5 mm cardiolipin and 1 mm diethylenetriamine pentaacetate in which DAG and ceramide are quantitatively phosphorylated to form 32P-labeled phosphatidic acid and ceramide 1-phosphate, respectively, which were then quantified. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 30 min in 100 mm imidazole HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, pH 6.6, 2 mm DTT, 10 µg/100 µl DAG kinase (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mm ATP, and 1 µCi/100 µl [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol (v/v, 2:1) and 1% HClO4, and lipids were extracted and washed twice with 1% HClO4. Lipids were resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC; Partisil K6 adsorption TLC plates, Whatman catalogue no. LK6D); the mobile phase contained chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (v/v/v, 65:15:5). The bands corresponding to phosphatidic acid and ceramide 1-phosphate were identified with known standards, and silicon was scraped into a scintillation vial for radioactivity measurement. [3H]Triolein bands from the same TLC plates were identified and quantified in the same way and were used as controls for lipid recovery. Cardiac muscle from left ventricles from 16-h-fasted mice were isolated, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Sorenson's buffer, pH 7.2, and treated with 1% OsO4 also in Sorenson's buffer for 1 h. After dehydration and embedment in Lx-112 (Ladd Research Industries), thin sections (60 nm) were cut using a MT-7000 ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined under a JEOL JEM-1200 EXII electron microscope. Pictures were taken by an ORCA-HR digital camera (Hamamatsu) and recorded with an Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Corp. Image Capture Engine. Total RNA was isolated using a TRIzol kit from Invitrogen. One to 5 µg of RNA was initially treated with DNase I (Invitrogen). The RNA samples were then reverse transcribed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR. Real time amplification was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences used for PCR amplification are listed in Table 1. Analysis was completed using iCycler iQ Real-Time Detection System software (Bio-Rad). Gene expression was normalized to β-actin mRNA levels.TABLE 1Primer sequences for RT-PCR analysis of gene expressionPrimersForwardReverseBactinAGGCCCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTAGGGGTGTTGAAGGTCTCAAACAPlin2CTACGACGACACCGATCATTGCGGAATACGGAGCidecATGCTGCAATGAAGACCGAGCTAACCACTCTGGCACCATPlin5TGAGGCAGAGCAAACACCGTACATCCACTGCATTCTGCAGCTCPparaTGCAGAGCAACCATCCAGAACCCGTTAATTAATGGCGAATPpardGCCTCGGGCTTCCACTACAGATCCGATCGCACTTCTCAPpargGAGTGTGACGACAAGATTTGGGTGGGCCAGAATGGCATCTAtglCGCCTTGCTGAGAATCACCATAGTGAGTGGCTGGTGAAAGGTAcox1ATCACGGGCACTTATGCTCTCACGGATAGGGACAPdk4GACCGCTTAGTAACACGTAACGGGGTCCACTGCpt1bGATGTTTGCAGAGCACGGCACCAGGTACCTGCTCACGGTABnpAGGTTTGCTATCTGGCAATGTCGAAGTTTAAGGCTCTGGACd36AATGGCACAGACGCAGCCTGGTTGTCTGGATTCTGGALplTCTGTACGGCACAGTGGCCTCTCGATGACGAAGCGlut4AGAGTCTAAAGCGCCTCCGAGACCAACGTGAADgat1GTGCACAAGTGGTGCATCAGCAGTGGGATCTGAGCCATCAAngptl4GGAAAAGATGCACCCTTCAATGCTGGATCTTGCTGTTTTG Open table in a new tab Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed using a high resolution imaging system with a 30-MHz imaging transducer (Vevo 770, VisualSonics) in unconscious mice. Before experiments, the mice were anesthetized with 1.5–2% isoflurane and thereafter maintained on 0.2–0.5% isoflurane throughout the experiment. Two-dimensional echocardiographic images were recorded in a digital format. Images were analyzed by a researcher blinded to the murine genotype. Left ventricular end diastolic dimension (LVIDd) and left ventricular end systolic dimension (LVIDs) were measured. The percentage of fractional shortening (FS) was calculated as follows: FS = ((LVIDd − LVIDs)/LVIDd) × 100. Heart tissue (20–30 mg) was homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm DTT with a mixture of protease inhibitors, and then ¼ volume of 30% sucrose was added to the samples immediately following homogenization. The mixtures were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane pellets were homogenized and resuspended in 300 µl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. The cytosolic fraction was obtained by concentrating the supernatants by acetone precipitation. 100 µg of protein of each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting was carried out using the primary antibody PKC-α. Integrin β1 and β-actin antibodies were used as membrane and cytosol controls (Abcam). All data are presented as mean ± S.D. unless indicated otherwise. Comparisons between two groups were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test; comparisons of more than two groups were performed with one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Survival rates were analyzed with log rank test. A p value of less than 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Hearts from 3-month-old hDgat1−/− mice with cardiomyocyte-specific DGAT1 deletion had a marked reduction in DGAT1 mRNA (Fig. 1A). DGAT activity assays demonstrated that conversion of DAG to TG was reduced ∼⅓ by loss of DGAT1 in cardiomyocytes, but this was not associated with a decrease in heart TG (Fig. 1B). DGAT1-deficient hearts had ∼60% increased levels of total FFAs, 85% increased total DAG, and 95% increased total ceramide (Fig. 1C). There were no changes in the circulating concentration of FFA, TG, glucose, or total cholesterol (Table 2). Both the number and size of lipid droplets, which accumulate after an overnight fast, did not change in 3-month-old hDgat1−/− mice (Fig. 1D).TABLE 2Plasma FFA, TG, glucose, and total cholesterol from 9-month-old Dgat1flox/flox, hDgat1−/−, and hiDgat1−/− mice (n = 4–5)GenotypeDgat1flox/floxhDgat1−/−hiDgat1−/−FFA (nmol/ml)315 ± 70.3374.9 ± 101.3185.8 ± 77.4ap < 0.05.TG (nmol/ml)846.4 ± 163854.0 ± 285.8662.5 ± 302.7Glucose (mm)6.5 ± 0.47.1 ± 0.65.7 ± 0.4Total cholesterol (pmol/ml)700.6 ± 167.6686.1 ± 217.4490.6 ± 153.9a p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab As hDgat1−/− mice aged, they had reduced longevity compared with their control littermates (Fig. 2A). Curves for wild-type, Dgat1flox/flox, and MHC-Cre transgenic mice were superimposable. Heart/body weight ratio was ∼30% greater in 9-month-old hDgat1−/− mice (Fig. 2B). Although heart function was normal in young mice, older hDgat1−/− mice had a ∼30% reduction in FS compared with Dgat1flox/flox control mice (Fig. 2C). Because total fatty acids and ceramides were increased, we measured individual lipid species with LC/MS. We observed an increase in total ceramides in hearts from hDgat1−/− mice (supplemental Table 1), although this increase was somewhat less than that found using the enzymatic method. C16, C18, C20, C20:1, C22:1, and C24:1 ceramides were significantly increased. Fatty acids were increased 75% in hDgat1−/− hearts due to an increase in C18, C18:1, and C18:2 fatty acids. There were no significant differences in other fatty acids or ceramides. In contrast, the only change in acyl-CoAs was a 26% reduction in C18 acyl-CoA. Consistent with"
https://openalex.org/W2001962475,"α-Neurexins (α-Nrxn) are mostly presynaptic cell surface molecules essential for neurotransmission that are linked to neuro-developmental disorders as autism or schizophrenia. Several interaction partners of α-Nrxn are identified that depend on alternative splicing, including neuroligins (Nlgn) and dystroglycan (αDAG). The trans-synaptic complex with Nlgn1 was extensively characterized and shown to partially mediate α-Nrxn function. However, the interactions of α-Nrxn with αDAG, neurexophilins (Nxph1) and Nlgn2, ligands that occur specifically at inhibitory synapses, are incompletely understood. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate the exact binding epitopes of αDAG and Nxph1 on Nrxn1α and show that their binding is mutually exclusive. Identification of an unusual cysteine bridge pattern and complex type glycans in Nxph1 ensure binding to the second laminin/neurexin/sex hormone binding (LNS2) domain of Nrxn1α, but this association does not interfere with Nlgn binding at LNS6. αDAG, in contrast, interacts with both LNS2 and LNS6 domains without inserts in splice sites SS#2 or SS#4 mostly via LARGE (like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase)-dependent glycans attached to the mucin region. Unexpectedly, binding of αDAG at LNS2 prevents interaction of Nlgn at LNS6 with or without splice insert in SS#4, presumably by sterically hindering each other in the u-form conformation of α-Nrxn. Thus, expression of αDAG and Nxph1 together with alternative splicing in Nrxn1α may prevent or facilitate formation of distinct trans-synaptic Nrxn·Nlgn complexes, revealing an unanticipated way to contribute to the identity of synaptic subpopulations."
https://openalex.org/W2101906215,"VEGF is a key regulator of endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and inflammation, which leads to activation of several signaling cascades, including the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway. NFAT is not only important for immune responses but also for cardiovascular development and the pathogenesis of Down syndrome. By using Down syndrome model mice and clinical patient samples, we showed recently that the VEGF-calcineurin-NFAT signaling axis regulates tumor angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. However, the connection between genome-wide views of NFAT-mediated gene regulation and downstream gene function in the endothelium has not been studied extensively. Here we performed comprehensive mapping of genome-wide NFATc1 binding in VEGF-stimulated primary cultured endothelial cells and elucidated the functional consequences of VEGF-NFATc1-mediated phenotypic changes. A comparison of the NFATc1 ChIP sequence profile and epigenetic histone marks revealed that predominant NFATc1-occupied peaks overlapped with promoter-associated histone marks. Moreover, we identified two novel NFATc1 regulated genes, CXCR7 and RND1. CXCR7 knockdown abrogated SDF-1- and VEGF-mediated cell migration and tube formation. siRNA treatment of RND1 impaired vascular barrier function, caused RhoA hyperactivation, and further stimulated VEGF-mediated vascular outgrowth from aortic rings. Taken together, these findings suggest that dynamic NFATc1 binding to target genes is critical for VEGF-mediated endothelial cell activation. CXCR7 and RND1 are NFATc1 target genes with multiple functions, including regulation of cell migration, tube formation, and barrier formation in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2136510984,"The development of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in three recipients of non-leukoreduced red blood cells from asymptomatic donors who subsequently developed the disease has confirmed existing concerns about the possible spread of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) via blood products. In addition, the presence of disease-associated misfolded prion protein (PrP(TSE)), generally associated with infectivity, has been demonstrated in the blood of vCJD patients. However, its origin and distribution in this biological fluid are still unknown. Various studies have identified cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) among the protein cargo in human blood-circulating extracellular vesicles released from endothelial cells and platelets, and exosomes isolated from the conditioned media of TSE-infected cells have caused the disease when injected into experimental mice. In this study, we demonstrate the detection of PrP(TSE) in extracellular vesicles isolated from plasma samples collected during the preclinical and clinical phases of the disease from mice infected with mouse-adapted vCJD and confirm the presence of the exosomal marker Hsp70 in these preparations."
https://openalex.org/W2020310113,"Direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) are tuned to motion in one direction. Starburst amacrine cells (SACs) are thought to mediate this direction selectivity through precise anatomical wiring to DSGCs. Nevertheless, we previously found that visual adaptation can reverse DSGCs's directional tuning, overcoming the circuit anatomy. Here we explore the role of SACs in the generation and adaptation of direction selectivity. First, using pharmacogenetics and two-photon calcium imaging, we validate that SACs are necessary for direction selectivity. Next, we demonstrate that exposure to an adaptive stimulus dramatically alters SACs' synaptic inputs. Specifically, after visual adaptation, On-SACs lose their excitatory input during light onset but gain an excitatory input during light offset. Our data suggest that visual stimulation alters the interactions between rod- and cone-mediated inputs that converge on the terminals of On-cone BCs. These results demonstrate how the sensory environment can modify computations performed by anatomically defined neuronal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2108065690,"The prevalence of metabolic syndrome has been increasing rapidly worldwide. The functions of zinc may have a potential association with metabolic syndrome, but such associations have not been investigated extensively. Therefore, we examined the relationship between serum zinc levels and metabolic syndrome or metabolic risk factors among South Korean adults ≥20 years of age. The analysis used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey of Korean civilians, conducted from January to December 2010. A total of 1,926 participants were analyzed in this study. Serum zinc levels in men were negatively associated with elevated fasting glucose (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36–0.93) and positively associated with elevated triglycerides (aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01–2.13). A difference in serum zinc levels was detected in women, depending on the number of metabolic syndrome components (p = 0.002). Furthermore, serum zinc levels showed a decreasing trend with increasing numbers of metabolic syndrome components in women with metabolic syndrome. These findings suggest that serum zinc levels might be associated with metabolic syndrome or metabolic risk factors. Further gender-specific studies are needed to evaluate the effect of dietary or supplemental zinc intake on metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2018970532,"Emerging evidence reveals that prion-like structures play important roles to maintain the well-being of cells. Although self-assembly of small molecules also affords prion-like nanofibrils (PriSM), little is known about the functions and mechanisms of PriSM. Previous works demonstrated that PriSM formed by a dipeptide derivative selectively inhibiting the growth of glioblastoma cells over neuronal cells and effectively inhibiting xenograft tumor in animal models. Here we examine the protein targets, the internalization, and the cytotoxicity pathway of the PriSM. The results show that the PriSM selectively accumulate in cancer cells via macropinocytosis to impede the dynamics of cytoskeletal filaments via promiscuous interactions with cytoskeletal proteins, thus inducing apoptosis. Intriguingly, Tau proteins are able to alleviate the effect of the PriSM, thus protecting neuronal cells. This work illustrates PriSM as a new paradigm for developing polypharmacological agents that promiscuously interact with multiple proteins yet result in a primary phenotype, such as cancer inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2030053236,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis is required for production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides that comprise β-amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we tested whether the experimental agent methylene blue (MB), used for treatment of methemoglobinemia, might improve AD-like pathology and behavioral deficits. We orally administered MB to the aged transgenic PSAPP mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis and evaluated cognitive function and cerebral amyloid pathology. Beginning at 15 months of age, animals were gavaged with MB (3 mg/kg) or vehicle once daily for 3 months. MB treatment significantly prevented transgene-associated behavioral impairment, including hyperactivity, decreased object recognition, and defective spatial working and reference memory, but it did not alter nontransgenic mouse behavior. Moreover, brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular β-amyloid deposits as well as levels of various Aβ species, including oligomers, were mitigated in MB-treated PSAPP mice. These effects occurred with inhibition of amyloidogenic APP proteolysis. Specifically, β-carboxyl-terminal APP fragment and β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 protein expression and activity were attenuated. Additionally, treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human wild-type APP with MB significantly decreased Aβ production and amyloidogenic APP proteolysis. These results underscore the potential for oral MB treatment against AD-related cerebral amyloidosis by modulating the amyloidogenic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2079319133,"In retinitis pigmentosa--a degenerative disease which often leads to incurable blindness--the loss of photoreceptors deprives the retina from a continuous excitatory input, the so-called dark current. In rodent models of this disease this deprivation leads to oscillatory electrical activity in the remaining circuitry, which is reflected in the rhythmic spiking of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). It remained unclear, however, if the rhythmic RGC activity is attributed to circuit alterations occurring during photoreceptor degeneration or if rhythmic activity is an intrinsic property of healthy retinal circuitry which is masked by the photoreceptor's dark current. Here we tested these hypotheses by inducing and analysing oscillatory activity in adult healthy (C57/Bl6) and blind mouse retinas (rd10 and rd1). Rhythmic RGC activity in healthy retinas was detected upon partial photoreceptor bleaching using an extracellular high-density multi-transistor-array. The mean fundamental spiking frequency in bleached retinas was 4.3 Hz; close to the RGC rhythm detected in blind rd10 mouse retinas (6.5 Hz). Crosscorrelation analysis of neighbouring wild-type and rd10 RGCs (separation distance <200 µm) reveals synchrony among homologous RGC types and a constant phase shift (∼70 msec) among heterologous cell types (ON versus OFF). The rhythmic RGC spiking in these retinas is driven by a network of presynaptic neurons. The inhibition of glutamatergic ganglion cell input or the inhibition of gap junctional coupling abolished the rhythmic pattern. In rd10 and rd1 retinas the presynaptic network leads to local field potentials, whereas in bleached retinas additional pharmacological disinhibition is required to achieve detectable field potentials. Our results demonstrate that photoreceptor bleaching unmasks oscillatory activity in healthy retinas which shares many features with the functional phenotype detected in rd10 retinas. The quantitative physiological differences advance the understanding of the degeneration process and may guide future rescue strategies."

Here, we demonstrate the residual immunogenicity of an extensively decellularized equine carotid artery (dEAC(intens)) and identify the involved immunogenic components. EAC were submitted to an elaborated intensified decellularization protocol with SDS/sodium desoxycholate for 72 h using increased processing volumes (dEAC(intens)), and compared to dEAC(ord) prepared by an ordinary protocol (40 h, normal volumes). Matrix integrity was checked via correlative volumetric visualization which revealed only minor structural changes in the arterial wall. In dEAC(intens), a substantial depletion of cellular components was obvious for smooth muscle actin (100%), MHC I complexes (97.8%), alphaGal epitops (98.4% and 91.3%) and for DNA (final concentration of 0.34 ± 0.16 ng/mg tissue). However, dEAC(intens) still evoked antibody formation in mice after immunization with dEAC(intens) extracts, although to a lower extent than dEAC(ord). Mouse plasma antibodies recognized a 140 kDa band which was revealed to contain collagen VI alpha1 and alpha2 chains via mass spectrometry of both 2D electrophoretically separated and immunoprecipitated proteins. Thus, even the complete removal of cellular proteins did not yield non-immunogenic dEAC as the extracellular matrix still conferred immunogenicity by collagen VI. However, as lower antibody levels were achieved by the intensified decellularization protocol, this seems to be a promising basis for further development."
https://openalex.org/W2025590128,"Heat shock protein (Hsp)70 is one of the most important stress-inducible proteins. Intracellular Hsp70 not only mediates chaperone-cytoprotective functions but can also block multiple steps in the apoptosis pathway. In addition, Hsp70 is actively released into the extracellular milieu, thereby promoting innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, Hsp70 may be a critical molecule in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis and a potential target in this disease due to its immunological and cytoprotective functions. To investigate the role of Hsp70 in MS pathogenesis, we examined its immune and cytoprotective roles using both in vitro and in vivo experimental procedures. We found that Hsp70.1-deficient mice were more resistant to developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates, suggesting that Hsp70.1 plays a critical role in promoting an effective myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-specific T cell response. Conversely, Hsp70.1-deficient mice that developed EAE showed an increased level of autoreactive T cells to achieve the same production of cytokines compared with the WT mice. Although a neuroprotective role of HSP70 has been suggested, Hsp70.1-deficient mice that developed EAE did not exhibit increased demyelination compared with the control mice. Accordingly, Hsp70 deficiency did not influence the vulnerability to apoptosis of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in culture. Thus, the immunological role of Hsp70 may be relevant in EAE, and specific therapies down-regulating Hsp70 expression may be a promising approach to reduce the early autoimmune response in MS patients."
https://openalex.org/W1991260245,"Translocation of proteins from the cytosol across the mitochondrial inner membrane is driven by action of the matrix-localized multi-subunit import motor, which is associated with the TIM23 translocon. The architecture of the import apparatus is not well understood. Here, we report results of site-specific in vivo photocross-linking along with genetic and coimmunoprecipitation analyses dissecting interactions between import motor subunits and the translocon. The translocon is composed of the two integral membrane proteins Tim23 and Tim17, each containing four membrane-spanning segments. We found that Tim23 having a photoactivatable cross-linker in the matrix exposed loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2 (loop 1) cross-linked to Tim44. Alterations in this loop destabilized interaction of Tim44 with the translocon. Analogously, Tim17 having a photoactivatable cross-linker in the matrix exposed loop between transmembrane segments 1 and 2 (loop 1) cross-linked to Pam17. Alterations in this loop caused destabilization of the interaction of Pam17 with the translocon. Substitution of individual photoactivatable residues in Tim44 and Pam17 in regions we previously identified as important for translocon association resulted in cross-linking to Tim23 and Tim17, respectively. Our results are consistent with a model in which motor association is achieved via interaction of Tim23 with Tim44, which serves as a scaffold for association of other motor components, and of Tim17 with Pam17. As both Tim44 and Pam17 have been implicated as regulatory subunits of the motor, this positioning is conducive for responding to conformational changes in the translocon upon a translocating polypeptide entering the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2077962618,"Previous evidence indicates that adiponectin possesses antifibrogenic activity in inhibiting liver fibrosis. Therapeutic strategies, however, are limited by adiponectin quaternary structure and effective concentrations in circulation. Here we postulate a novel molecular mechanism, whereby adiponectin targets focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity and disrupts key features of the fibrogenic response. Adiponectin-null (Ad–/–) mice and wild-type littermates were exposed to either saline or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 6 wk. CCl4-gavaged mice were also injected with attenuated adenoviral adiponectin (Ad-Adn) or Ad-LacZ for 2 wk. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were treated with or without adiponectin to elucidate signal transduction mechanisms. In vivo delivery of Ad-Adn markedly attenuates CCl4-induced expression of key integrin proteins and markers of HSC activation: αv, β3, β1, α2(I) collagen, and α-smooth muscle actin. Confocal experiments of liver tissues demonstrated that adiponectin delivery also suppressed vinculin and p-FAK activity in activated HSCs. In vitro, adiponectin induced dephosphorylation of FAK, mediated by a physical association with activated tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2. Conversely, Shp2 knockdown by siRNA significantly attenuated adiponectin-induced FAK deactivation, and expression of TIMP1 and α2(I) collagen was abolished in the presence of adiponectin and si-FAK. Finally, we documented that either adiponectin or the synthetic peptide with adiponectin properties, ADP355, suppressed p-FAK in synthetic matrices with stiffness measurements of 9 and 15 kPa, assessed by immunofluorescent imaging and quantitation. The in vivo and in vitro data presented indicate that disassembly of focal adhesion complexes in HSCs is pivotal for hepatic fibrosis therapy, now that small adiponectin-like peptides are available.—Kumar, P., Smith, T., Rahman, K., Mells, J.

https://openalex.org/W2003367727,"It has been suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in metabolic disorders including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. The fact that mitochondrial defects can be accumulated over time as a normal part of aging may explain why some individuals can eat all sorts of foods and remain at normal weight while they are young. However, around the fourth decade of life there is a trend towards “middle-age spread” with weight gain and the body's decreasing ability to metabolize calories efficiently. To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial variants are associated with BMI in adults, we analyzed a total number of 984 mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (mtSNPs) in a sample of 6,528 individuals participating in the KORA studies. To assess mtSNP association while taking heteroplasmy into account we used the raw signal intensity values measured on the microarray and applied linear regression. Significant results were obtained for 2 mtSNPs located in the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit genes (MT-CO1: Padjusted = 0.0140 and MT-CO3: Padjusted = 0.0286) and 3 mtSNPs located in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit genes (MT-ND1, MT-ND2 and MT-ND4L: Padjusted = 0.0286). Polymorphisms located in the MT-CO3 and MT-ND4L genes have not been associated with BMI or related phenotypes in the past. Our results highlight the importance of the mitochondrial genome among the factors that contribute to the risk of high BMI. Focusing on mitochondrial variants may lead to further insights regarding effects of existing medications, or even to the development of innovative treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2045227762,"HSPB6 is a member of the human small heat shock protein (sHSP) family, a conserved group of molecular chaperones that bind partially unfolded proteins and prevent them from aggregating. In vertebrate sHSPs the poorly structured N-terminal domain has been implicated in both chaperone activity and the formation of higher-order oligomers. These two functionally important properties are likely intertwined at the sequence level, complicating attempts to delineate the regions that define them. Differing from the prototypical α-crystallins human HSPB6 has been shown to only form dimers in solution making it more amendable to explore the determinants of chaperoning activity alone. Using a systematic and iterative deletion strategy, we have extensively investigated the role of the N-terminal domain on the chaperone activity of this sHSP. As determined by size-exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering, most mutants had a dimeric structure closely resembling that of wild-type HSPB6. The chaperone-like activity was tested using three different substrates, whereby no single truncation, except for complete removal of the N-terminal domain, showed full loss of activity, pointing to the presence of multiple sites for binding unfolding proteins. Intriguingly, we found that the stretch encompassing residues 31 to 35, which is nearly fully conserved across vertebrate sHSPs, acts as a negative regulator of activity, as its deletion greatly enhanced chaperoning capability. Further single point mutational analysis revealed an interplay between the highly conserved residues Q31 and F33 in fine-tuning its function."
https://openalex.org/W1967600468,"Matrix attachment region (MAR)-binding proteins have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of host as well as viral genes, but their precise role in HPV-infected cervical cancer remains unclear.

In most virus borne cancers, synergistic cellular changes must take place for malignant progression to occur.

HPV E6, E6AP and cervical cancer.BMC Biochem. 2008; 9: S4Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), is highly associated with infection by high risk human papilloma viruses (HPVs) 2The abbreviations used are: HPVhuman papilloma virusMARmatrix attachment regionAP-1activator protein-1HDAChistone deacetylasesTip60Tat-interacting protein 60 kDa. (2.Burd E.M. Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). HPVs are nonenveloped DNA viruses that infect mucosal or cutaneous squamous epithelium and result in a global change in cellular gene expression that facilitates cellular hyperproliferation. Adenocarcinomas of the cervix account for ∼10–30% of cervical carcinomas, and their incidence is increasing, especially among young women (3.Parazzini F. La Vecchia C. Epidemiology of adenocarcinoma of the cervix.Gynecol. Oncol. 1990; 39: 40-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).

Analysis of human papillomavirus infection and molecular alterations in adenocarcinoma of the cervix.Mod. Pathol. 1998; 11: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to cervical squamous cell carcinomas with prevalence of HPV16, a predominance of HPV18 infection has been described in cervical adenocarcinomas (5.Tenti P. Pavanello S.

The high risk HPV encodes two transforming genes: E6 and E7, both of which interfere with the key elements in the cell cycle control machinery. The constitutive expression of E6 and E7 is mainly dependent on the availability of host cell transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1) that is formed by either homodimerization of Jun proteins (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) or heterodimerization of Jun and Fos proteins (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) through the “leucine zipper.” It was reported that JunB constitutes the major dimerization partner of c-Fos, which increases with increased severity of cervical cancer (7.Mahata S.

Telomerase activation by the E6 gene product of human papilloma virus type 16.Nature. 1996; 380: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). In fact, E6 alters the substrate specificity of a cellular ubiquitin ligase, E6AP, so that it stably associates with and polyubiquitinylates tumor suppressor p53, thereby degrading it via 26 S proteasome (1.Beaudenon S. Huibregtse J.M. HPV E6, E6AP and cervical cancer.BMC Biochem. 2008; 9: S4Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The resultant effect counteracts the normal apoptotic and cell cycle arrest responses of HPV-positive cells, thereby ultimately resulting in deregulated cell proliferation. The above discussion reveals that E6, contributing effectively in the antiapoptosis network, represents one of the most promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of HPV-positive tumors and dysplasias because its repression may result in reactivation of tumor suppressor pathways in cancer cells. Although prophylactic vaccines are currently available and show high efficacy against the establishment of HPV infection, low rates of initiation and lower rates of completion of the vaccination regimen, as well as the lack of an opportunity to be vaccinated prior to infection, has led to the development of a patient population for whom no therapy for infection is available. Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations are essential in establishing the transformed phenotype in addition to the genetic changes associated with the transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell. In this relation, acetylation of histone, as well as other transcription regulatory non-histone factors by lysine acetyltransferases, e.g. Tip60 (14.Dar A. Shibata E. Dutta A.

Lysine acetyltransferases and HDACs have been shown to play a critical role in transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. HPV18 E6 protein has been observed to induce the degradation of the tumor suppressor lysine acetyltransferase, Tip60 (Tat-interacting protein 60 kDa), which is involved in transcriptional regulation, checkpoint activation, and p53-directed proapoptotic pathways (14.Dar A.

On the other hand, nuclear matrix protein SMAR1 interacts with HDAC1-associated repressor complex at cyclin D1 promoter and allows histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression (17.Rampalli S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 9902-9913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SMAR1 has also been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of viral genes in which it regulates viral transcription by alternative compartmentalization of LTR, resulting in a decreased virion production of HIV-1 (21.Sreenath K. Pavithra L. Singh S. Sinha S. Dash P.K. Siddappa N.B. Ranga U. Mitra D. Chattopadhyay S. Nuclear matrix protein SMAR1 represses HIV-1 LTR mediated transcription through chromatin remodeling.Virology. 2010; 400: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All of this information leads to the possibility of reversing the key alterations in the apoptotic machinery in HPV18-infected cervical adenocarcinoma by modulating SMAR1 that may alter the status and/or function of E6, Tip60, p53, and HDACs. However, there is no report on this critical function of SMAR1, if any, in reinstalling the “missing” apoptotic program in HPV18-infected cervical cancer cells. Recently, curcumin-induced up-regulation of SMAR1 and the contribution of this MAR-binding protein in sensitizing breast cancer cells toward doxorubicin have been reported from our laboratory (22.Sen G.S. Mohanty S. Hossain D.M. Bhattacharyya S. Banerjee S. Chakraborty J. Saha S. Ray P. Bhattacharjee P. Mandal D. Bhattacharya A. Chattopadhyay S. Das T. Sa G.

Recent reports have also suggested the HPV16 E6 protein as a target for curcuminoids, curcumin conjugates, and congeners for chemoprevention of cervical cancers (23.Singh A.K. Misra K.

Sci. 2013; 5: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this regard, curcumin-induced suppression of STAT3 activation has been reported to be associated with the gradual loss of HPV16 E6 and E7 expression and cell viability (24.Shukla S. Mahata S. Shishodia G. Pandey A. Tyagi A. Vishnoi K. Basir S.F. Das B.C. Bharti A.C. Functional regulatory role of STAT3 in HPV16-mediated cervical carcinogenesis.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e67849Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). According to Maher et al. (25.Maher D.M. Bell M.C. O'Donnell E.A. Gupta B.K. Jaggi M. Chauhan S.C. Curcumin suppresses human papillomavirus oncoproteins, restores p53, Rb, and PTPN13 proteins and inhibits benzo[a]pyrene-induced upregulation of HPV E7.Mol. Carcinog. 2011; 50: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), curcumin restores p53, Rb, and PTPN13 proteins to induce apoptosis in HPV16-infected cervical cancer cells. However, there are hardly any reports describing the involvement of SMAR1 in curcumin-induced HPV18-infected cervical adenocarcinoma cell apoptosis. Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we elucidate the role of SMAR1 as the suppressor of HPV18 E6 to refurbish the lost apoptotic program of the cells. Mechanistically, curcumin installs a proapoptotic cycle in HPV18-infected cervical adenocarcinoma cells. Curcumin up-regulates SMAR1 to potentiate recruitment of SMAR1-HDAC1 repressor complex at the LCR and E6 MAR sequences, thereby decreasing histone acetylation at Lys-9 and Lys-18 leading to reorientation of the chromatin. As a consequence, c-Fos binding at the putative AP-1 sites on E6 promoter is inhibited. E6 depletion interrupts degradation of E6-mediated p53 and lysine acetyl transferase, Tip60. Tumor suppressor p53, being stabilized by SMAR1 and acetylated by Tip60, in turn induces SMAR1 to orchestrate the cycle that leads to HPV18-infected cervical adenocarcinoma cell apoptosis via p53-mediated transactivation of proapoptotic genes. In fact, earlier reports have shown that Tip60 also promotes repression of E6 after it was rescued from E6-mediated degradation (15.Jha S. Vande Pol S. Banerjee N.S. Dutta A.B. Chow L.T. Dutta A. Destabilization of TIP60 by human papillomavirus E6 results in attenuation of TIP60-dependent transcriptional regulation and apoptotic pathway.Mol.

This hitherto unappreciated but novel function of SMAR1 highlights the potential of this protein in regulating the E6-mediated antiapoptotic network in HPV18-infected cervical adenocarcinoma. The cervical cancer cell line HeLa (p53 degraded/HPV18-E6-positive) were obtained from National Centre for Cell Science (Pune, India). The cells were routinely maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 (26.Saha B. Adhikary A. Ray P. Saha S. Chakraborty S.

Cells were treated with different concentrations of curcumin (Sigma) for different time points to select the optimum dose and time required for cancer cell apoptosis. An equivalent amount of carrier (dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to untreated cells. To inhibit HDAC1 activity, cells were preincubated with broad HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (0.5 µm; Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 h prior to curcumin treatment. To inhibit proteasome activity, cells were preincubated with MG-132 (10 µm; Sigma). To assess cell death, cells were stained with propidium iodide and annexin V-FITC (BD Pharmingen) and analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson). Electronic compensation of the instrument was done to exclude overlapping of the emission spectra. Total 10,000 events were acquired for analysis using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Annexin V-positive cells were regarded as apoptotic cells (27.Chakraborty J. Banerjee S. Ray P. Hossain D.M. Bhattacharyya S. Adhikary A. Chattopadhyay S. Das T. Sa G.

For direct Western blot analysis, a total of 50 µg of protein was resolved using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with specific antibodies, for example, anti-p53, -Bax, -Puma, -Caspase-3, -Caspase-9, -E6, -c-Fos, -SMAR1, -Tip60, and -p300 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-Ser(P)-15-p53 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); thereafter, the immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Equal protein loading was confirmed with anti-α-actin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For the determination of direct interaction between two proteins, a co-immunoprecipitation technique was employed (28.Mohanty S. Saha S. Hossain D.S. Adhikary A. Mukherjee S. Manna A. Chakraborty S.

Samples (300 µg of protein from the total lysate) were incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-p53/SMAR1 antibody and then incubated for 2h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose (Invitrogen). Immunocomplexes were washed of unbound proteins with cold Tris-buffered saline with protease inhibitors, and pelleted beads were boiled for 5min in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting for detection of Ub/p53/SMAR1/HDAC1. The input protein used in immunoprecipitation was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-α-actin. Two µg of the total RNA extracted from cells with TRIzol Q16 reagent (Invitrogen) was reverse transcribed and then subjected to PCR with enzymes and reagents of the RTplusPCR system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using GeneAmpPCR 2720 (Applied Biosystems) (26.Saha B.

The cDNAs were amplified with primers specific for BAX (5′-TTTGCTTCAGGGTTTCATCC-3′/5′-CAGTTGAAGTTGCCGTCAGA-3′), E6 (5′-AAGCTACCTGATCTGTGCACGG-3′/5′-GCTGGATTCAACGGTT-TCTGG-3′), c-FOS (5′-AGACAGACCAACTAGAAGATGA-3′/5′-AGCTCTGTGGCCATGGGCCCC-3′), SMAR1 (5′-GCATTGAGGCCAAGCTGAAAGCTC-3′/5′-CGGAGTTCAGGGTGATGAGTGTGAC-3′), PUMA (5′-CCACCACCATCTCAGGAAAG-3′/5′-ACGTTTGGCTCATTTGCTCT-3′), and GAPDH (internal control) (5′-CAG AACATCATCCTGCCTCT-3′/5′-GCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGTTGAG-3′). The expression constructs pBK-CMV-SMAR1-cDNA and control pcDNA3.0 vectors (2 µg/million cells) were introduced into exponentially growing cancer cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Stably expressing clones were isolated by limiting dilution and selection with G418 sulfate (1 mg/ml; Cellgro), and G418-resistant cells were cloned and screened by immunofluorescence or Western blotting with specific antibodies. For endogenous silencing of specific genes, cells were transfected with 300 pmol of Tip60 siRNA/p53 shRNA/SMAR1shRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 separately for 12 h. The mRNA and protein levels were determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. ChIP assays were performed using a ChIP assay kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR assay for identification of SMAR1, HDAC1, and c-Fos binding regions on E6 promoter was performed using the nine different primer sets: set 1, 5′-GACCGTTTTCGGTTACTCCC-3′/5′-CTACCTGATCTGTGCACGG-3′; set 2, 5′-GGATCCTCAAAGCGCGCC-3′/5′-AGTATACCCATGCTGCA-3′; set 3, 5′-GCAGCATGGGGTATACTG-3′/5′-GCCTGCGATGTCAGAAAC-3′; set 4, 5′-GTGTCTCCATACACAGAGTC-3′/5′-GAGCACGACAGGAACGAC-3′; set 5, 5′-CCTGGCACGTACACGCACACGC-3′/5′-CTGTGTGTTATGTGGTTGCGCCC-3′; set 6, 5′-GGGCGCAACCACATAACACACAG-3′/5′-GCACAATACAGTACGCTGGC-3′; set 7, 5′-CCACAGACATAAGCCAAAGGCAAC-CG-3′/5′-CCTGTCCAGGTGCGCTAC-3′; set 8, 5′-GTAGCGCACCTGGACAGG-3′/5′-GCAACCGAAATAGGTTGGGCAGC-3′; and set 9, 5′-CCCGACCGTTTTCGGTTACTCCC-3′/5′-GGCGCGCTTTGAGGATCCAAC-3′. PCR amplifications of AP-1-1 and AP-1-2 response elements on the E6 promoter region were performed using the following primers: AP-1-1, 5′-TGCTTGCATAACTATATC-CACTCCC-3′ and 5′-TATGTGCTGCCCAACCTATTTCGG-3′; and AP-1-2, 5′-TGCTTGCATAACTATATCCACTCCC-3′ and 5′-GAAAAGTATAGTATGTGCTGCCCAACCTA-3′. Extracted DNA (2 µl) was used for 45 cycles of amplification in 5 µl of reaction mixture under the following conditions: 95 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. For EMSA, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were prepared according to standard protocol, and 30 µg was used for gel shift assays. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the SMAR1 binding sites 1 and 5 or the AP-1 binding sites were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Probe purification was done using Probequant G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). Binding reactions were performed in a 10 µl of total volume containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5–1 µg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC), 10 µg of BSA, and 1 µg of SMAR1 recombinant protein or 30 µg of nuclear lysate. For cold competitor, 100 times the unlabeled probe was used. Samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature prior to addition of radiolabeled probe. The samples were then incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and the products of binding reactions were resolved using 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried under vacuum and processed for autoradiography. The values are shown as standard error of mean, unless otherwise indicated. The data were analyzed and, where appropriate, significance (p < 0.05) of the differences between mean values was determined by a Student's t test. Nuclear matrix and matrix attachment regions (MARs) have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of host, as well as viral genes, but their precise role in HPV or human papillomavirus transcription remains unclear. Recently the contribution of SMAR1 in regulating transcription of HIV genes has been accredited (21.Sreenath K. Pavithra L. Singh S. Sinha S. Dash P.K. Siddappa N.B. Ranga U. Mitra D.

To address the role of SMAR1 in regulation of HPV18 E6, we first deciphered their relationship, if any. Our results depicted that the increase in SMAR1 by 25 µm curcumin (according to our earlier reports (27.Chakraborty J. Banerjee S. Ray P. Hossain D.M. Bhattacharyya S. Adhikary A. Chattopadhyay S.

Similar results were obtained by transfecting HeLa cells with SMAR1-cDNA (Fig. 1A). In contrast, down-regulation of SMAR1 transcript by SMAR1-specific shRNA was correlated with the increased E6 expression both at transcriptional (Fig. 1A, left panel) and translational levels (Fig. 1A, middle panel) in HeLa cells even in the presence of curcumin. The results shown in the right panel of Fig. 1A confirmed the transcription efficiency of the experiment. Because HPV18 E6 disrupts the normal apoptotic machinery of the noncancerous cells, our next approach was to understand the effect of SMAR1-induced E6 down-regulation in HeLa cells. To this end, up-regulation of SMAR1 by curcumin in a dose-dependent manner in wild-type p53-expressing HPV-infected cervical cancer cells resulted in significant cell death at concentrations starting from 25 µm (Fig. 1B, left panel). Because concentrations beyond 25 µm were found to be toxic to normal cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) (Fig. 1B, middle panel), we restricted our future experiments to this dose. Next, we performed cell death analyses of HeLa cells using 25 µm curcumin in a time-dependent manner. Because maximum cell death was obtained at 24 h (Fig. 1B, right panel), beyond which no significant change in cell death was observed (data not shown), our subsequent experiments were performed using a 25 µm dose of curcumin for 24 h. In fact, curcumin-treated HeLa cells furnished an increased number of annexin V-positive cells (Fig. 1C) and DAPI-stained nucl"

Here, we have examined the role of the linker region between the TRPM8 inner gate and the TRP box (referred to as the S6-TRP box linker) to identify structural determinants of channel gating. Stepwise substitutions of segments in the S6-TRP box linker of TRPM8 channel with the cognate TRPV1 channel sequences produced functional chimeric channels, and identified Tyr981 as a central molecular determinant of channel function. Additionally, mutations in the 986–990 region had a profound impact on channel gating by voltage and menthol, as evidenced by the modulation of the conductance-to-voltage (G-V) relationships. Simulation of G-V curves using an allosteric model for channel activation revealed that these mutations altered the allosteric constants that couple stimuli sensing to pore opening.

Although the clinical presentation of human type 1 diabetes (T1D) and canine diabetes are similar, the aetiologies may differ. The aim of this study was to investigate if autoimmune aetiology resembling human T1D is as prevalent in dogs as previously reported.Sera from 121 diabetic dogs representing 40 different breeds were tested for islet cell antibodies (ICA) and GAD65 autoantibodies (GADA) and compared with sera from 133 healthy dogs. ICA was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using both canine and human frozen sections. GADA was detected by in vitro transcription and translation (ITT) of human and canine GAD65, followed by immune precipitation. Sections of pancreata from five diabetic dogs and two control dogs were examined histopathologically including immunostaining for insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreas polypeptide.None of the canine sera analysed tested positive for ICA on sections of frozen canine or human ICA pancreas. However, serum from one diabetic dog was weakly positive in the canine GADA assay and serum from one healthy dog was weakly positive in the human GADA assay. Histopathology showed marked degenerative changes in endocrine islets, including vacuolisation and variable loss of immune-staining for insulin. No sign of inflammation was noted.Contrary to previous observations, based on results from tests for humoral autoreactivity towards islet proteins using four different assays, and histopathological examinations, we do not find any support for an islet autoimmune aetiology in canine diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2077584114,"DTNBP1 (dystrobrevin-binding protein 1), which encodes dysbindin-1, is one of the leading susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. Both dysbindin-1B and -1C isoforms are decreased, but the dysbindin-1A isoform is unchanged in schizophrenic hippocampal formation, suggesting dysbindin-1 isoforms may have distinct roles in schizophrenia. We found that mouse dysbindin-1C, but not dysbindin-1A, is localized in the hilar glutamatergic mossy cells of the dentate gyrus. The maturation rate of newborn neurons in sandy (sdy) mice, in which both dysbindin-1A and -1C are deleted, is significantly delayed when compared with that in wild-type mice or with that in muted (mu) mice in which dysbindin-1A is destabilized but dysbindin-1C is unaltered. Dysbindin-1C deficiency leads to a decrease in mossy cells, which causes the delayed maturation of newborn neurons. This suggests that dysbindin-1C, rather than dysbindin-1A, regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a non-cell autonomous manner."

In healthy cells, the concentration of ROS is minimized by a system of biological antioxidants. However, heat shock changes the equilibrium between oxidative stress and antioxidant activity, that is, a rapid rise in temperature induces biophoton emission from ROS. Although the rate and intensity of biophoton emission was observed to increase in response to elevated temperatures, pretreatment at lower high temperatures inhibited photon emission at higher temperatures. Biophoton measurements are useful for observing and evaluating heat shock."
https://openalex.org/W1998695576,"Identification of key metabolites for complex diseases is a challenging task in today's medicine and biology. A special disease is usually caused by the alteration of a series of functional related metabolites having a global influence on the metabolic network. Moreover, the metabolites in the same metabolic pathway are often associated with the same or similar disease. Based on these functional relationships between metabolites in the context of metabolic pathways, we here presented a pathway-based random walk method called PROFANCY for prioritization of candidate disease metabolites. Our strategy not only takes advantage of the global functional relationships between metabolites but also sufficiently exploits the functionally modular nature of metabolic networks. Our approach proved successful in prioritizing known metabolites for 71 diseases with an AUC value of 0.895. We also assessed the performance of PROFANCY on 16 disease classes and found that 4 classes achieved an AUC value over 0.95. To investigate the robustness of the PROFANCY, we repeated all the analyses in two metabolic networks and obtained similar results. Then we applied our approach to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and found that a top ranked candidate was potentially related to AD but had not been reported previously. Furthermore, our method was applicable to prioritize the metabolites from metabolomic profiles of prostate cancer. The PROFANCY could identify prostate cancer related-metabolites that are supported by literatures but not considered to be significantly differential by traditional differential analysis. We also developed a freely accessible web-based and R-based tool at http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/PROFANCY."

Biodiversity and population density are high, with a maximum average of 26.7±0.9 species m(-2) and 418.1±49.6 individuals m(-2) on the east side of the reef summit. These figures contrast with the surrounding abyssal plain fauna, with an average of only 18.1±1.4 species and 29.4±4.3 individuals m(-2) (mean ± standard error). The east side of the reef summit, where the highest richness and density of fauna are found, faces into the predominant bottom current, which likely increases in speed to the summit and serves as a source of particulate food for the numerous suspension feeders present there. We conclude that the observed faunal distribution patterns could be the result of hydrodynamic patterns and food availability above and around the reef. To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the distribution and diversity of benthic fauna on a rocky reef in deep water."
https://openalex.org/W1966566824,"It is well documented that tumor cells undergo dramatic genetic and epigenetic changes during initial establishment as cell lines and in subsequent serial passaging, and that the resultant cell lines may have evolved significantly from the primary tumors from which they were derived. This has potential implications due to their widespread use in drug response experiments and studies of genomic function. One approach to optimizing the design of such cell line studies is to identify and use the cell lines that faithfully recapitulate critical features of primary tumors. To evaluate the epigenetic fidelity of breast cancer cell lines in the context of primary tumors, we performed methylation profiling of 55 well-characterized breast cancer cell lines on the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip platform, and compared them to publicly available methylation profiles of primary breast tumors. We found that the DNA methylation profiles of breast cancer cell lines largely retain the features that characterize primary tumors, although there are crucial differences as well. We describe these similarities and differences between primary tumors and breast cancer cell lines in detail, and develop a quantitative measure of similarity that is used to score each cell line with respect to how faithfully its methylation profile mirrors that of primary tumors."

Forty-one clinically healthy subjects were included as controls. Gene expression of MMP-9 and its main tissue inhibitors TIMP-1 and -2 were analyzed in freshly isolated or cultured blood mononuclear cells. Corresponding protein levels were assessed in cell supernatants and plasma. In post-MI patients, mRNA levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and -2 were significantly higher than in controls while protein levels in cell supernatants and plasma did not differ between groups. The Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale was used to assess depressive symptomatology. Repeated assessments during the first 18 months after MI showed significantly higher CES-D scores in patients compared with controls. However, there were no relationships between depressive mood and any of the measurements of MMP-9 or TIMPs.Our findings indicate that overexpression of MMP-9 and TIMPs in blood mononuclear cells and elevated depressive symptoms represent two unrelated phenomena after MI."
https://openalex.org/W2050718303,"The prognostic value of proliferation index (PI) and apoptotic index (AI), caspase-8, -9 and -10 expression have been investigated in primary Ewing's sarcoma family of tumours (ESFT). Proliferating cells, detected by immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, were identified in 91% (91/100) of tumours with a median PI of 14 (range 0–87). Apoptotic cells, identified using the TUNEL assay, were detected in 96% (76/79) of ESFT; the median AI was 3 (range 0–33). Caspase-8 protein expression was negative (0) in 14% (11/79), low (1) in 33% (26/79), medium (2) in 38% (30/79) and high (3) in 15% (12/79) of tumours, caspase-9 expression was low (1) in 66% (39/59) and high (3) in 34% (20/59), and caspase-10 protein was low (1) in 37% (23/62) and negative (0) in 63% (39/62) of primary ESFT. There was no apparent relationship between caspase-8, -9 and -10 expression, PI and AI. PI was predictive of relapse-free survival (RFS; p = 0.011) and overall survival (OS; p = <0.001) in a continuous model, whereas AI did not predict outcome. Patients with tumours expressing low levels of caspase-9 protein had a trend towards a worse RFS than patients with tumours expressing higher levels of caspase-9 protein (p = 0.054, log rank test), although expression of caspases-8, -9 and/or -10 did not significantly predict RFS or OS. In a multivariate analysis model that included tumour site, tumour volume, the presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis, PI and AI, PI independently predicts OS (p = 0.003). Consistent with previous publications, patients with pelvic tumours had a significantly worse OS than patients with tumours at other sites (p = 0.028); patients with a pelvic tumour and a PI≥20 had a 6 fold-increased risk of death. These studies advocate the evaluation of PI in a risk model of outcome for patients with ESFT."

We identified a SNP (rs10118570 GG in mitogen-activated protein kinase associated protein 1, MAPKAP1) contributes to anti-infection (adjusted OR = 0.35) and anti-fibrogenesis (adjusted RR = 0.44) in the discovery study. Replicative and combined studies showed consistent protective quality for this genotype (replicative: adjusted OR = 0.37 for anti-infection, and adjusted RR = 0.40 for anti-fibrogenesis; Combined: adjusted OR = 0.45 for anti-infection, and adjusted RR = 0.42 for anti-fibrogenesis). Univariate and multivariate analysis in the discovery, replicative and combined studies, suggested that durations (years), splenomegaly, serum ALB and rs10118570 were independent predictors influencing the fibrogenesis. The analysis of gene-gene interaction showed rs10118570 functions independently.

https://openalex.org/W2002295115,"PpcA is the most abundant member of a family of five triheme cytochromes c7 in the bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens (Gs) and is the most likely carrier of electrons destined for outer surface during respiration on solid metal oxides, a process that requires extracellular electron transfer. This cytochrome has the highest content of lysine residues (24%) among the family, and it was suggested to be involved in e−/H+ energy transduction processes. In the present work, we investigated the functional role of lysine residues strategically located in the vicinity of each heme group. Each lysine was replaced by glutamine or glutamic acid to evaluate the effects of a neutral or negatively charged residue in each position. The results showed that replacing Lys9 (located near heme IV), Lys18 (near heme I) or Lys22 (between hemes I and III) has essentially no effect on the redox properties of the heme groups and are probably involved in redox partner recognition. On the other hand, Lys43 (near heme IV), Lys52 (between hemes III and IV) and Lys60 (near heme III) are crucial in the regulation of the functional mechanism of PpcA, namely in the selection of microstates that allow the protein to establish preferential e−/H+ transfer pathways. The results showed that the preferred e−/H+ transfer pathways are only established when heme III is the last heme to oxidize, a feature reinforced by a higher difference between its reduction potential and that of its predecessor in the order of oxidation. We also showed that K43 and K52 mutants keep the mechanistic features of PpcA by establishing preferential e−/H+ transfer pathways at lower reduction potential values than the wild-type protein, a property that can enable rational design of Gs strains with optimized extracellular electron transfer capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W1972471897,"The adventitia is suggested to contribute to vascular remodeling; however, the site-selective inflammatory responses in association with the development of atherosclerosis remain to be elucidated.Wild-type or apolipoprotein E knockout male C57BL/6J background mice were fed standard chow for 16, 32, and 52 weeks, and the morphology of the aortic arch, descending aorta, and abdominal aorta was compared. Atheromatous plaque formation progressed with age, particularly in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta but not in the descending aorta. In addition, we found that the numbers of macrophages, T-lymphocytes, and microvessels, assessed by anti-F4/80, CD3, and CD31 antibodies, were higher in the adventitia of the abdominal aorta at 52 weeks. These numbers were positively correlated with plaque formation, but negatively correlated with elastin content, resulting in the enlargement of the total vessel area. In aortic tissues, interleukin-6 levels increased in the atheromatous plaque with age, whereas the level of regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) increased with age, and compared with other sites, it was particularly distributed in inflammatory cells in the adventitia of the abdominal aorta.This study suggests that adventitial inflammation contributes to the age-dependent structural alterations, and that the activation/inactivation of cytokines/chemokines is involved in the process."
https://openalex.org/W1986425494,"Background We previously found that a very low geno2pheno false positive rate (FPR ≤2%) defines a viral population associated with low CD4 cell count and the highest amount of X4-quasispecies. In this study, we aimed at evaluating whether FPR ≤2% might impact on the viro-immunological response in HIV-1 infected patients starting a first-line HAART. Methods The analysis was performed on 305 HIV-1 B subtype infected drug-naïve patients who started their first-line HAART. Baseline FPR (%) values were stratified according to the following ranges: ≤2; 2–5; 5–10; 10–20; 20–60; >60. The impact of genotypically-inferred tropism on the time to achieve immunological reconstitution (a CD4 cell count gain from HAART initiation ≥150 cells/mm3) and on the time to achieve virological success (the first HIV-RNA measurement <50 copies/mL from HAART initiation) was evaluated by survival analyses. Results Overall, at therapy start, 27% of patients had FPR ≤10 (6%, FPR ≤2; 7%, FPR 2–5; 14%, FPR 5–10). By 12 months of therapy the rate of immunological reconstitution was overall 75.5%, and it was significantly lower for FPR ≤2 (54.1%) in comparison to other FPR ranks (78.8%, FPR 2–5; 77.5%, FPR 5–10; 71.7%, FPR 10–20; 81.8%, FPR 20–60; 75.1%, FPR >60; p = 0.008). The overall proportion of patients achieving virological success was 95.5% by 12 months of therapy. Multivariable Cox analyses showed that patients having pre-HAART FPR ≤2% had a significant lower relative adjusted hazard [95% C.I.] both to achieve immunological reconstitution (0.37 [0.20–0.71], p = 0.003) and to achieve virological success (0.50 [0.26–0.94], p = 0.031) than those with pre-HAART FPR >60%. Conclusions Beyond the genotypically-inferred tropism determination, FPR ≤2% predicts both a poor immunological reconstitution and a lower virological response in drug-naïve patients who started their first-line therapy. This parameter could be useful to identify patients potentially with less chance of achieving adequate immunological reconstitution and virological undetectability."
https://openalex.org/W1998749866,"Desmanthus paspalaceus (Lindm.) Burkart belongs to the D. virgatus complex, subfamily Mimosoidae. The known potential as livestock fodder of several of these legumes prompted us to undertake a phenotypic, molecular, and symbiotic characterization of the D. paspalaceus symbionts in the Santa Fe province, Argentina. The rhizobia collected—containing isolates with different abiotic-stress tolerances—showed a remarkable genetic diversity by PCR fingerprinting, with 11 different amplification profiles present among 20 isolates. In selected isolates 16S-rDNA sequencing detected mesorhizobia (60%) and rhizobia (40%) within the collection, in contrast to the genus of the original inoculant strain CB3126—previously isolated from Leucaena leucocephala—that we typified here through its 16S rDNA as Sinorhizobium terangae. The results revealed the establishment by diverse bacterial genera -rhizobia, sinorhizobia, and mesorhizobia- of full N2-fixing symbiotic associations with D. paspalaceus. This diversity was paralleled by the presence of at least two different nodC allelic variants. The identical nodC alleles of the Mesorhizobia sp. 10.L.4.2 and 10.L.5.3 notably failed to group within any of the currently described rhizo-/brady-/azorhizobial nodC clades. Interestingly, the nodC from S. terangae CB3126 clustered close to homologs from common bean nodulating rhizobia, but not with the nodC from S. terangae WSM1721 that nodulates Acacia. No previous data were available on nod-gene phylogeny for Desmanthus symbionts. A field assay indicated that inoculation of D. paspalaceus with the local Rhizobium sp. 10L.11.4 produced higher aerial-plant dry weights compared to S. teranga CB3126–inoculated plants. Neither the mesorhizobia 10.L.4.2 or 10.L.5.3 nor the rhizobium 10L.11.4 induced root nodules in L. leucocephala or P. vulgaris. The results show that some of the local isolates have remarkable tolerances to several abiotic stresses including acidity, salt, and temperature; while exhibiting prominent N2 fixation; thus indicating suitability as candidates for inoculation of D. paspalaceus."
https://openalex.org/W1996621534,"Three recombinant influenza A viruses with different neuraminidases (NAs) in the background of A/PR/8/34 (PR8), named rPR8-H5N1NA, rPR8-H9N2NA, and rPR8-H1N1NA, derived from H5N1, H9N2, H1N1 (swine) viruses, respectively, were constructed. We performed a quantitative proteomics analysis to investigate differential protein expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells infected with recombinant and wild-type influenza viruses to determine whether NA replacement would alter host cell gene expression. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), we identified 12 up-regulated and 49 down-regulated protein spots, including cytoskeletal proteins, molecular biosynthesis proteins, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway proteins, and heat shock proteins. The most significant changes in infected cells were observed for molecular biosynthesis proteins. We found more differentially expressed protein spots in cells infected with rPR8-H5N1NA or rPR8-H9N2NA viruses than cells infected with wild-type virus. Many of those proteins are postulated to be involved in cell-cell fusion, but the full mechanism remains to be explored. Meanwhile, our data demonstrate that the wild-type virus has evolutionary advantages over recombinant viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2080490908,"Nanolithography techniques enable the fabrication of complex nanodevices that can be used for biosensing purposes. However, these devices are normally supported by a substrate and their use is limited to in vitro applications. Following a top-down procedure, we designed and fabricated composite inductance-capacitance (LC) nanoresonators that can be detached from their substrate and dispersed in water. The multimaterial composition of these resonators makes it possible to differentially functionalize different parts of the device to obtain stable aqueous suspensions and multi-sensing capabilities. For the first time, we demonstrate detection of these devices in an aqueous environment, and we show that they can be sensitized to their local environment and to chemical binding of specific molecular moieties. The possibility to optically probe the nanoresonator resonance in liquid dispersions paves the way to a variety of new applications, including injection into living organisms for in vivo sensing and imaging."
