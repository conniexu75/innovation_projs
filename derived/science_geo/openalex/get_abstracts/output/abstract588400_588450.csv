https://openalex.org/W2622731166,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is commonly found in the human nasopharynx and is the causative agent of multiple diseases. Since invasive pneumococcal infections are associated with encapsulated pneumococci, the capsular polysaccharide is the target of licensed pneumococcal vaccines. However, there is an increasing distribution of non-vaccine serotypes, as well as nonencapsulated S. pneumoniae (NESp). Both encapsulated and nonencapsulated pneumococci possess the polyamine oligo-transport operon (potABCD). Previous research has shown inactivation of the pot operon in encapsulated pneumococci alters protein expression and leads to a significant reduction in pneumococcal murine colonization, but the role of the pot operon in NESp is unknown. Here, we demonstrate deletion of potD from the NESp NCC1 strain MNZ67 does impact expression of the key proteins pneumolysin and PspK, but it does not inhibit murine colonization. Additionally, we show the absence of potD significantly increases biofilm production, both in vitro and in vivo. In a chinchilla model of otitis media (OM), the absence of potD does not significantly affect MNZ67 virulence, but it does significantly reduce the pathogenesis of the virulent encapsulated strain TIGR4 (serotype 4). Deletion of potD also significantly reduced persistence of TIGR4 in the lungs but increased persistence of PIP01 in the lungs. We conclude the pot operon is important for the regulation of protein expression and biofilm formation in both encapsulated and NCC1 nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, in contrast to encapsulated pneumococcal strains, polyamine acquisition via the pot operon is not required for MNZ67 murine colonization, persistence in the lungs, or full virulence in a model of OM. Therefore, NESp virulence regulation needs to be further established to identify potential NESp therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2622947525,"Stimulation of deeper brain structures by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) plays a role in the study of reward and motivation mechanisms, which may be beneficial in the treatment of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, electric field distributions induced in the brain by deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) are still unknown. In this paper, the double cone coil, H-coil and Halo-circular assembly (HCA) coil which have been proposed for dTMS have been numerically designed. The distributions of magnetic flux density, induced electric field in an anatomically based realistic head model by applying the dTMS coils were numerically calculated by the impedance method. Results were compared with that of standard figure-of-eight (Fo8) coil. Simulation results show that double cone, H- and HCA coils have significantly deep field penetration compared to the conventional Fo8 coil, at the expense of induced higher and wider spread electrical fields in superficial cortical regions. Double cone and HCA coils have better ability to stimulate deep brain subregions compared to that of the H-coil. In the mean time, both double cone and HCA coils increase risk for optical nerve excitation. Our results suggest although the dTMS coils offer new tool with potential for both research and clinical applications for psychiatric and neurological disorders associated with dysfunctions of deep brain regions, the selection of the most suitable coil settings for a specific clinical application should be based on a balanced evaluation between stimulation depth and focality."
https://openalex.org/W2624023985,"To establish the normal values of spino-pelvic alignment and to clarify the effect of age-related changes using large, community-based cohorts.In this study, data from 1461 participants (466 men, 995 women) were analyzed. On lateral standing radiographs, the following parameters were measured: thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic incidence (PI), and C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA). All values are expressed as the mean±standard deviation. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to examine correlations between variables of spino-pelvic parameters. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between age and spino-pelvic parameters. Therefore, we entered values for the body mass index (BMI), SVA, TK, and PI-LL into a multiple regression model to adjust for potential confounding factors.The SVA, TK, and PT increased with age, and LL decreased with age. Regarding sex differences, the TK was statistically significantly larger in men than in women, and LL, PT, and PI were statistically significantly smaller in men than in women. Correlation coefficients between the SVA and TK, between the SVA and PI-LL, and between TK and PI-LL were none, strong, and weak, respectively. Results of multiple regression analysis between age and spino-pelvic parameters showed that the standardized partial regression coefficients for the SVA, TK, and PI-LL were 0.17, 0.30, and 0.23, respectively, in men and 0.29, 0.32, and 0.23, respectively, in women.We found that all parameters were significantly associated with age in men and women. The SVA, TK, and PT increased with age, and LL decreased with age. Results of multiple regression analysis also demonstrated that the SVA, TK, and PI-LL are related to age. Indeed, the PI-LL value increased with age. In this study, a more excessive PI-LL mismatch was shown, indicating an increased risk of spinal malalignment. Differences in the absolute values of spino-pelvic parameters in each sex were small yet statistically significant. Thus, further study should be performed to corroborate this finding."
https://openalex.org/W2623330179,"Class 1 integrons have played a major role in the global dissemination of antibiotic resistance. Reconstructing the history of class 1 integrons might help us control further spread of antibiotic resistance by understanding how human activities influence microbial evolution. Here we describe a class 1 integron that represents an intermediate stage in the evolutionary history of clinical integrons. It was embedded in a series of nested transposons, carried on an IncP plasmid resident in Enterobacter, isolated from the surface of baby spinach leaves. Based on the structure of this integron, we present a modified hypothesis for integron assembly, where the ancestral clinical class 1 integron was captured from a betaproteobacterial chromosome to form a Tn402-like transposon. This transposon then inserted into a plasmid-borne Tn21-like ancestor while in an environmental setting, possibly a bacterium resident in the phyllosphere. We suggest that the qacE gene cassette, conferring resistance to biocides, together with the mercury resistance operon carried by Tn21, provided a selective advantage when this bacterium made its way into the human commensal flora via food. The integron characterized here was located in Tn6007, which along with Tn6008, forms part of the larger Tn6006 transposon, itself inserted into another transposable element to form the Tn21-like transposon, Tn6005. This element has previously been described from the human microbiota, but with a promoter mutation that upregulates integron cassette expression. This element we describe here is from an environmental bacterium, and supports the hypothesis that the ancestral class 1 integron migrated into anthropogenic settings via foodstuffs. Selection pressures brought about by early antimicrobial agents, including mercury, arsenic and disinfectants, promoted its initial fixation, the acquisition of promoter mutations, and subsequent dissemination into various species and pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2623194764,"Background There is growing evidence from high-income countries that maternal country of birth is a risk factor for stillbirth. We aimed to examine the association between maternal region of birth and stillbirth between 2000 and 2011 inclusive in Victoria, Australia. Methods Retrospective population based cohort study of all singleton births at 24 or more weeks gestational age from 2000–2011 in Victoria, Australia. Stillbirths due to termination of pregnancy, babies with congenital anomalies and Indigenous mothers were excluded. Main Outcome Measure: Stillbirth. Results Over the 12-year period there were 685,869 singleton births and 2299 stillbirths, giving an overall stillbirth rate of 3·4 per 1000 births. After adjustment for risk factors, compared to women born in Australia/New Zealand, women born in South Asia (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01–1.53, p = 0.01), were more likely to have a stillbirth whereas women born in South East and East Asia were (aOR 0.60, (95% CI 0.49–0.72, p<0.001) less likely to have a stillbirth. Additionally, the increasing rate of stillbirth as gestation length progressed began to rise earlier and more steeply in the South Asian compared to Australian/New Zealand born women. The following risk factors were also significantly associated with an increased odds of stillbirth in multivariate analyses: maternal age <20 and 35 years and more, nulliparity, low socio-economic status, previous stillbirth, no ultrasound reported in 1st trimester, pre-existing hypertension, antepartum haemorrhage and failure to detect growth restriction antenatally. Conclusion Maternal region of birth is an independent risk factor for stillbirth. Improvements in the rate of stillbirth, particularly late pregnancy stillbirth, are likely to be gained in high-income settings where clinical care is informed by maternal region of birth."
https://openalex.org/W2622525157,"Textural measures have been widely explored as imaging biomarkers in cancer. However, their robustness under dynamic range and spatial resolution changes in brain 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI) has not been assessed. The aim of this work was to study potential variations of textural measures due to changes in MRI protocols.Twenty patients harboring glioblastoma with pretreatment 3D T1-weighted MRIs were included in the study. Four different spatial resolution combinations and three dynamic ranges were studied for each patient. Sixteen three-dimensional textural heterogeneity measures were computed for each patient and configuration including co-occurrence matrices (CM) features and run-length matrices (RLM) features. The coefficient of variation was used to assess the robustness of the measures in two series of experiments corresponding to (i) changing the dynamic range and (ii) changing the matrix size.No textural measures were robust under dynamic range changes. Entropy was the only textural feature robust under spatial resolution changes (coefficient of variation under 10% in all cases).Textural measures of three-dimensional brain tumor images are not robust neither under dynamic range nor under matrix size changes. Standards should be harmonized to use textural features as imaging biomarkers in radiomic-based studies. The implications of this work go beyond the specific tumor type studied here and pose the need for standardization in textural feature calculation of oncological images."
https://openalex.org/W2622125366,"Background Because maternal mortality is a rare event, it is important to study maternal near-miss as a complement to evaluate and improve the quality of obstetric care. Thus, the study was conducted with the aim of assessing the incidence and causes of maternal near-miss. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in five selected public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from May 1, 2015 to April 30, 2016. All maternal near-miss cases admitted to the selected hospitals during the study period were prospectively recruited. World Health Organization criteria were used to identify maternal near-miss cases. The number of maternal near-miss cases over one year per 1000 live births occurring during the same year was calculated to determine the incidence of maternal near-miss. Underlying and contributing causes of maternal near-miss were documented from each participant’s record. Results During the one-year period, there were a total of 238 maternal near-miss cases and 29,697 live births in all participating hospitals, which provides a maternal near-miss incidence ratio of 8.01 per 1000 live births. The underlying causes of the majority of maternal near-miss cases were hypertensive disorders and obstetric hemorrhage. Anemia was the major contributing cause reported for maternal near-miss. Most of the maternal near-miss cases occurred before the women’s arrival at the participating hospitals. Conclusion The study demonstrated a lower maternal near-miss incidence ratio compared to previous country-level studies. The majority of the near-miss cases occurred before the women’s arrival at the participating hospitals, which underscores the importance of improving pre-hospital barriers. Efforts made toward improvement in the management of life-threatening obstetric complications could reduce the occurrence of maternal near-miss problems that occur during hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W2622292600,"Although most of cases of dengue infections are asymptomatic or mild symptomatic some individuals present warning signs progressing to severe dengue in which plasma leakage is a hallmark.The present study used Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS®) which allows for electrical monitoring of cellular barrier function measuring changes in Transendothelial Electric Resistance (TEER) to investigate the parameters associated with dengue induced leakage. Three groups of individuals were tested: dengue-positives with plasma leakage (leakage), dengue-positives without plasma leakage (no leakage), and dengue-negatives (control). Data show that TEER values of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was significantly lower after incubation with serum from subjects of the leakage group in comparison to the no leakage or control groups. The serum levels of CXCL1, EGF, eotaxin, IFN-γ, sCD40L, and platelets were significantly decreased in the leakage group, while IL-10, IL-6, and IP-10 levels were significantly increased. We also found a strong correlation between TEER values and augmented levels of IP-10, GM-CSF, IL-1α, and IL-8, as well as decreased levels of CXCL1 and platelets.The present work shows that the magnitude of the immune response contributes to the adverse plasma leakage outcomes in patients and that serum components are important mediators of changes in endothelial homeostasis during dengue infections. In particular, the increased levels of IP-10 and the decreased levels of CXCL1 and platelets seem to play a significant role in the disruption of vascular endothelium associated with leakage outcomes after DENV infection. These findings may have important implications for both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to predict and mitigate vascular permeabilization in those experiencing the most severe clinical disease outcomes after dengue infection."
https://openalex.org/W2623316343,"Background The visual analogue scale (VAS) is widely used in clinical practice by occupational physicians to assess perceived stress in workers. However, a single cut-off (black-or-white decision) inadequately discriminates between workers with and without stress. We explored an innovative statistical approach to distinguish an at-risk population among stressed workers, and to establish a threshold over which an action is urgently required, via the use of two cut-offs. Methods Participants were recruited during annual work medical examinations by a random sample of workers from five occupational health centres. We previously proposed a single cut-off of VAS stress in comparison with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS14). Similar methodology was used in the current study, along with a gray zone approach. The lower limit of the gray zone supports sensitivity (“at-risk” threshold; interpreted as requiring closer surveillance) and the upper limit supports specificity (i.e. “intervention” threshold–emergency action required). Results We included 500 workers (49.6% males), aged 40±11 years, with a PSS14 score of 3.8±1.4 and a VAS score of 4.0±2.4. Using a receiver operating characteristic curve and the PSS cut-off score of 7.2, the optimal VAS threshold was 6.8 (sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.87). The lower and upper thresholds of the gray zone were 5 and 8.2, respectively. Conclusions We identified two clinically relevant cut-offs on the VAS of stress: a first cut-off of 5.0 for an at-risk population, and a second cut-off of 8.2 over which an action is urgently required. Future investigations into the relationships between this upper threshold and deleterious events are required."
https://openalex.org/W2622009279,"Background HER2 is one of the predominant therapeutic targets in breast cancer. The metastatic selection process may lead to discrepancies between the HER2 status of the primary tumor and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). This study analyzed the HER2 status of CTCs in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer at the time of diagnosis. Aim of the study was to assess potential discordance of HER2 status between primary tumor and CTCs, as this may have important implications for the use of HER2-targeted therapy. Methods The number and HER2 status of CTCs out of 30ml peripheral blood were assessed in 642 patients using the CellSearch System (Janssen Diagnostics, USA). The cutoff for CTC positivity was the presence of at least 1 CTC, and the cutoff for HER2 positivity of CTCs was the presence of at least 1 CTC with a strong HER2 staining. Results 258 (40.2%) of the 642 patients were positive for CTCs (median 2; range 1–1,689). 149 (57.8%) of these 258 patients had at least 1 CTC with strong HER2 staining. The presence of HER2-positive CTCs was not associated with tumor size (p = 0.335), histopathological grading (p = 0.976), hormone receptor status (ER: p = 0.626, PR: p = 0.263) or axillary lymph node involvement (p = 0.430). Overall, 83 (32.2%) of the CTC-positive patients exclusively had CTCs with strong HER2 staining, whereas 31 (12.0%) had only CTCs with negative HER2 staining. Within-sample variation in the HER2 status of CTCs was found in 86 (57.8%) of the 149 patients with more than 1 CTC. Conclusion This study demonstrated that discordance between the HER2 expression of CTCs and that of the primary tumor frequently occurs in early breast cancer. Future follow-up evaluation will assess whether this discrepancy may contribute to trastuzumab resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2623789210,"Current literature is in disagreement regarding female sex as a risk factor for pain after surgery. We hypothesized, that sex differences exist but that they are influenced by certain factors. Here, we investigated the influence of sex for different clinically relevant postoperative pain (POP) outcome parameters and evaluated the role of assumed confounders for sex differences.From 1372 screened patients undergoing orthopedic surgery at the university hospital of Muenster between March 2010 and June 2011, 890 patients were included. The validated International Pain Outcomes questionnaire was used to assess the role of sex for several aspects of POP including pain severity, physical and emotional functional interference as well as the patient's perceptions of the care they received on the first day after surgery. Assessed confounders were age, preoperative chronic pain, anesthetic technique employed and surgical procedure. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics Software 22.Linear regression analysis demonstrated that sex was a statistically significant risk factor for ""worst pain since surgery"". Additionally, significant sex differences in ""time spent in severe pain"", ""feeling anxious due to pain"", ""feeling helpless due to pain"" and ""opioid consumption since surgery"" could be identified. An univariate general linear model showed that ""age"" and ""preoperative pain"" were significant confounders for sex differences. Further descriptive subgroup analysis revealed consistent sex differences for several POP outcome variables especially in patients older than 50 years or patients with preoperative chronic pain. However, sex differences disappeared in younger patients and in patients without preoperative pain.Our data confirmed that sex differences exist in pain intensity and frequency, pain interference with feelings and opioid consumption during the first 24 hours postoperatively. However, sex differences were significantly influenced by the factors ""age"" and ""preoperative pain"". These findings may in part explain why clinical studies get different results related to sex differences and renders specific awareness in older women and female patients with preoperative chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2622160804,"Objective Current pharmacological agents used to treat Parkinson disease (PD) tremor and essential tremor (ET) provide suboptimal benefit and are commonly associated with significant adverse effects. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has been shown to be effective for wrist tremor though functionally bothersome muscle weakness frequently occurs. This is the longest study to date demonstrating that BoNT-A therapy coupled with kinematic guidance can provide efficacious outcomes for upper limb tremor with minimized unwanted weakness. Methods A total of 28 PD and 24 ET participants with bothersome, disabling tremor, received six serial BoNT-A treatments every 16 weeks starting at week 0 with a follow-up visit 6 weeks following a treatment, totaling 96 weeks. Clinical scales, including Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale (FTM), and sensor-based tremor assessments were conducted at each visit. Kinematics was utilized to identify which arm muscles contributed to the tremulous movements and the experienced injector used clinical expertise in determining BoNT-A dosages. Results Following BoNT-A treatment, clinical ratings of tremor severity and functional ability (FTM) showed significant improvements following the first treatment which was maintained up to week 96 in PD and ET. Kinematics detected a significant reduction in PD and ET tremor amplitudes by 70% and 76% over the treatment course, respectively. By objectively distinguishing tremulous muscles and tremor severity, adverse effects were limited to mild perceived weakness by participants in injected muscles during follow-ups. Following the fourth treatment, BoNT-A dosages in flexor and extensor wrist muscles and biceps were reduced for those experiencing residual weakness which ultimately did not interfere with tremor relief or arm function. Conclusions Kinematics is an objective method that can aid clinicians in assessing and determining optimal BoNT-A parameters to alleviate both PD and ET tremor. BoNT-A injections are tolerable and effective when focal therapy regimens are determined and optimized kinematically over a long-term."
https://openalex.org/W2623571175,"Diagnosing infectious diseases using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) offers a conclusive result in determining the infection, the strain or type of pathogen, and the level of infection. However, due to the high-cost instrumentation involved and the complexity in maintenance, it is rarely used in the field to make a quick turnaround diagnosis. In order to provide a higher level of accessibility than current qPCR devices, a set of 3D manufacturing methods is explored as a possible option to fabricate a low-cost and portable qPCR device. The key advantage of this approach is the ability to upload the digital format of the design files on the internet for wide distribution so that people at any location can simply download and feed into their 3D printers for quick manufacturing. The material and design are carefully selected to minimize the number of custom parts that depend on advanced manufacturing processes which lower accessibility. The presented 3D manufactured qPCR device is tested with 20-μL samples that contain various concentrations of lentivirus, the same type as HIV. A reverse-transcription step is a part of the device's operation, which takes place prior to the qPCR step to reverse transcribe the target RNA from the lentivirus into complementary DNA (cDNA). This is immediately followed by qPCR which quantifies the target sequence molecules in the sample during the PCR amplification process. The entire process of thermal control and time-coordinated fluorescence reading is automated by closed-loop feedback and a microcontroller. The resulting device is portable and battery-operated, with a size of 12 × 7 × 6 cm3 and mass of only 214 g. By uploading and sharing the design files online, the presented low-cost qPCR device may provide easier access to a robust diagnosis protocol for various infectious diseases, such as HIV and malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2621671764,"Introduction The risk of professional burnout is constituted by job-related as well as individual factors. The latter involve affective temperament, which influences the perception of job-related stress. The aim of the present study was to assess the affective temperament, the level of job stress and professional burnout, as well as the relationships between these variables, in public servants and nurses. Material and methods 100 civil servants and 100 nurses were enrolled in the study. Affective temperament and burnout were assessed by means of TEMPS-A and MBI questionnaires, respectively. To measure the level of job-related stress, we have designed a 6-item self-reported questionnaire, which considered stressors common for both professions. Results Compared to the civil servants, nurses showed higher rate of anxious temperament and experienced greater intensity of job-related stress. The groups did not differ in the intensity of burnout symptoms. The rates of cyclothymic and anxious temperaments correlated with the intensity of stress, and burnout symptoms in the group of nurses. Within the civil servants group, the level of stress correlated with intensity of burnout, however no correlations with affective temperament were observed. The regression analysis performed in both groups revealed the significant effect of stress and cyclothymic temperament on burnout, while the effect of anxious temperament was not significant. Conclusions Cyclothymic and anxious temperaments are related to the level of experienced job stress and the risk of burnout. In professions like nursing, where employees show elevated rates of these temperaments, burnout prevention and stress management education is of particular importance."
https://openalex.org/W2622193041,"Banana (Musa spp.) is an important crop in the African Great Lakes region in terms of income and food security, with the highest per capita consumption worldwide. Pests, diseases and climate change hamper sustainable production of bananas. New breeding tools with increased crossbreeding efficiency are being investigated to breed for resistant, high yielding hybrids of East African Highland banana (EAHB). These include genomic selection (GS), which will benefit breeding through increased genetic gain per unit time. Understanding trait variation and the correlation among economically important traits is an essential first step in the development and selection of suitable GS models for banana. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that trait variations in bananas are not affected by cross combination, cycle, field management and their interaction with genotype. A training population created using EAHB breeding material and its progeny was phenotyped in two contrasting conditions. A high level of correlation among vegetative and yield related traits was observed. Therefore, genomic selection models could be developed for traits that are easily measured. It is likely that the predictive ability of traits that are difficult to phenotype will be similar to less difficult traits they are highly correlated with. Genotype response to cycle and field management practices varied greatly with respect to traits. Yield related traits accounted for 31–35% of principal component variation under low and high input field management conditions. Resistance to Black Sigatoka was stable across cycles but varied under different field management depending on the genotype. The best cross combination was 1201K-1xSH3217 based on selection response (R) of hybrids. Genotyping using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers revealed that the training population was genetically diverse, reflecting a complex pedigree background, which was mostly influenced by the male parents."
https://openalex.org/W2622441545,"Background Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections are associated with increased risk of HIV transmission. We determined HSV-2 prevalence, incidence and associated risk factors, incidence among persons with indeterminate results, and prevalence of HSV-2/HIV co-infection among young adults (18–34 years) and adolescents (16–17 years) enrolled in an HIV incidence cohort study in western Kenya. Methods Participants (n = 1106; 846 adults) were screened and those HIV-1 negative were enrolled and followed-up quarterly for one year. HSV-2 was assessed using the Kalon enzyme immunoassay. HSV-2 incidence was calculated separately among HSV-2 seronegative participants and those indeterminate at baseline. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of HSV-2 infection and Poisson regression was used to assess HSV-2 incidence and associated factors. Results Overall, HSV-2 prevalence was 26.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 23.9–29.4] and was higher in adults (31.5% [95% CI: 28.3–34.9]) than adolescents (10.7% [95% CI: 7.1–15.3]). Factors associated with prevalent HSV-2 included female gender, increasing age, HIV infection, history of sexually transmitted infection, low level of education, multiple sexual partners, and being married, divorced, separated or widowed. Overall HSV-2 incidence was 4.0 per 100 person-years (/100PY) 95% CI: 2.7–6.1 and was higher in adults (4.5/100PY) and females (5.1/100PY). In multivariable analysis only marital status was associated with HSV-2 incidence. Among 45 participants with indeterminate HSV-2 results at baseline, 22 seroconverted, resulting in an incidence rate of 53.2 /100PY [95% CI: 35.1–80.9]. Inclusion of indeterminate results almost doubled the overall incidence rate to 7.8 /100 PY [95% CI: 5.9–10.5]. Prevalence of HIV/HSV-2 co-infection was higher in female adults than female adolescents (17.1 [95% CI: 13.6–21.0] versus 3.4 [95% CI: 1.1–7.8]). Conclusion The high incidence rate among persons with indeterminate results underscores the public health concerns for HSV-2 spread and underreporting of the HSV-2 burden. Careful consideration is needed when interpreting HSV-2 serology results in these settings."

However we lack neuronal networks with balanced excitatory-inhibitory activities, which are suitable for single cell analysis. We generated low-density networks of hPSC-derived GABAergic and glutamatergic cortical neurons. We used two different co-culture models with astrocytes. We show that these cultures have balanced excitatory-inhibitory synaptic identities using confocal microscopy, electrophysiological recordings, calcium imaging and mRNA analysis. These simple and robust protocols offer the opportunity for single-cell to multi-level analysis of patient hiPSC-derived cortical excitatory-inhibitory networks; thereby creating advanced tools to study disease mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2623396598,"In the field of word recognition and reading, it is commonly assumed that frequently repeated words create more accessible memory traces than infrequently repeated words, thus capturing the word-frequency effect. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that a seemingly related factor, contextual diversity (defined as the number of different contexts [e.g., films] in which a word appears), is a better predictor than word-frequency in word recognition and sentence reading experiments. Recent research has shown that contextual diversity plays an important role when learning new words in a laboratory setting with adult readers. In the current experiment, we directly manipulated contextual diversity in a very ecological scenario: at school, when Grade 3 children were learning words in the classroom. The new words appeared in different contexts/topics (high-contextual diversity) or only in one of them (low-contextual diversity). Results showed that words encountered in different contexts were learned and remembered more effectively than those presented in redundant contexts. We discuss the practical (educational [e.g., curriculum design]) and theoretical (models of word recognition) implications of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2624049724,"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis has emerged as a global threat. The aim of this work was to compare the CT findings of primary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and drug-sensitive tuberculosis in non-AIDS adults.From January 2012 to February 2016, 89 patients with primary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were retrospectively reviewed, and 89 consecutive drug sensitive TB patients with no history of anti-tuberculous chemotherapy from January 2014 to November 2014 were enrolled as control group. All patients were seronegative for HIV. The patients' demographic data and the locations, frequency and patterns of lung lesions on chest CT were compared.Gender and frequency of diabetes were similar between the two groups. The mean age of primary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients was younger than that of drug-sensitive tuberculosis (39.0 vs 47.5, P = 0.005). Lung cavitary nodules or masses were more frequently observed and also showed greater extent in primary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis compared with drug-sensitive tuberculosis. The extent of bronchiectasis was significantly greater in primary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis than in drug-sensitive tuberculosis. Calcification, large nodules and calcified lymph nodes were more frequent in drug-sensitive tuberculosis.Characteristic chest CT findings may help differentiate between primary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and drug-sensitive tuberculosis in patients without HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2621483478,"Genome editing by the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats / CRISPR-associated protein 9) system is a revolutionary strategy to study gene functions. Since the efficiency of gene disruption in cell culture does not reach 100% typically, cloning of mutant cells is often performed to obtain fully mutated cells. Therefore, a method to discriminate accurately mutated clones easily and quickly is crucial to accelerate the research using CRISPR/Cas9. Here, we show that knockout cells can be discriminated by a competition-based PCR, using a mixture of three primers, among which one primer overlaps with the Cas9 cleavage site. Together, we show how to optimize primer design in order to improve the effectiveness of the discrimination. Finally, we applied this method to show that mutations conferring drug resistance can be detected with high accuracy. The provided method is easy to perform and requires only basic laboratory equipment, making it suitable for almost all laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W2624349226,"The polyphagous mirid bug Apolygus lucorum (Heteroptera: Miridae) has more than 200 species of host plants and is an insect pest of important agricultural crops, including cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and mungbean (Vigna radiata). Previous field trials have shown that A. lucorum adults prefer mungbean to cotton plants, indicating the considerable potential of mungbean as a trap crop in cotton fields. However, direct evidence supporting the migration of A. lucorum adults from cotton to mungbean is lacking. We developed a DNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach to reveal the movement of A. lucorum between neighboring mungbean and cotton fields. Two pairs of PCR primers specific to cotton or mungbean were designed to target the trnL-trnF region of chloroplast DNA. Significant differences in the detectability half-life (DS50) were observed between these two host plants, and the mean for cotton (8.26 h) was approximately two times longer than that of mungbean (4.38 h), requiring weighted mean calculations to compare the detectability of plant DNA in the guts of field-collected bugs. In field trials, cotton DNA was detected in the guts of the adult A. lucorum individuals collected in mungbean plots, and the cotton DNA detection rate decreased successively from 5 to 15 m away from the mungbean-cotton midline. In addition to the specific detection of cotton- and mungbean-fed bugs, both cotton and mungbean DNA were simultaneously detected within the guts of single individuals caught from mungbean fields. This study successfully established a tool for molecular gut-content analyses and clearly demonstrated the movement of A. lucorum adults from cotton to neighboring mungbean fields, providing new insights into understanding the feeding characteristics and landscape-level ecology of A. lucorum under natural conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2623229700,"The genus Malassezia includes lipophilic yeasts, which are part of the skin microbiota of various mammals and birds. Unlike the rest of Malassezia species, M. pachydermatis is described as non-lipid-dependent, as it is able to grow on Sabouraud glucose agar (SGA) without lipid supplementation. In this study we have examined the phenotypic variability within M. pachydermatis and confirmed its lipid-dependent nature using a synthetic agar medium. We used a selection of representative non-lipid-dependent strains from different animal species and three atypical lipid-dependent strains of this species, which were not able to grow after multiple passages on SGA. More than 400 lipid-dependent Malassezia isolates from animals were studied in order to detect the three lipid-dependent strains of M. pachydermatis. The identity of the atypical strains was confirmed by DNA sequencing. On the other hand, we have modified the Tween diffusion test, which is widely used in the characterization of these yeasts, by using a synthetic agar-based medium instead of SGA. This modification has proved to be useful for differentiation of M. pachydermatis strains, providing reproducible results and a straightforward interpretation. The finding of these peculiar lipid-dependent strains exemplifies the large variability within the species M. pachydermatis, which involves rare atypical strains with particular growth requirements."

This study evaluated the effect of liver cirrhosis on oncologic and surgical outcomes and prognostic factors in colorectal cancer patients. Fifty-five consecutive colorectal cancer patients with liver cirrhosis underwent colorectal resection (LC group). Using a prospectively maintained database, these patients were matched 1:4 using propensity scoring with R programming language, package ""MatchIt"" and ""optmatch"" by sex, age, cancer location, and tumor stage with 220 patients without liver cirrhosis (non-LC group), resulting in 275 patients. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was significantly worse in the LC group than in the non-LC group (46.7% vs. 76.2% respectively, P < 0.001); however, the 5-year proportion of recurrence free (PRF) rates were similar (73.1% vs. 84.5% respectively, P = 0.094). On multivariate analysis of the LC group, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage ≥III disease, venous invasion, and a model for end-stage liver disease plus serum sodium (MELD-Na) score >10 were prognostic factors for OS. However, the OS was not different between the LC group with MELD-Na score ≤10 and the non-LC group (5-year OS rate, TNM stage ≤II, 85.7 vs 89.5%, p = 0.356; TNM stage ≥III, 41.1 vs 66.2%, p = 0.061). Colorectal cancer patients with liver cirrhosis have poorer OS compared to those without liver cirrhosis; however, the PRF rates are similar. It might be due to the mortality from the liver, and surgical treatment should be actively considered for patients with MELD-Na score <10."
https://openalex.org/W2621583181,"To evaluate porcine vitreous flow and water flow rates in a new prototype hypersonic vitrectomy system compared to currently available pneumatic guillotine vitrectors (GVs) systems.Two vitrectors were tested, a prototype, ultrasound-powered, hypersonic vitrector (HV) and a GV. Porcine vitreous was obtained within 12 to 24 h of sacrifice and kept at 4°C. A vial of vitreous or water was placed on a precision balance and its weight measured before and after the use of each vitrector. Test parameters included changes in aspiration levels, vitrector gauge, cut rates for GVs, % ultrasound (US) power for HVs, and port size for HVs. Data was analysed using linear regression and t-tests.There was no difference in the total average mean water flow between the 25-gauge GV and the 25-gauge HV (t-test: P = 0.363); however, 25-gauge GV was superior (t-test: P < 0.001) in vitreous flow. The 23-gauge GV was only more efficient in water and vitreous removal than 23-gauge HV needle-1 (Port 0.0055) (t-test: P < 0.001). For HV, wall thickness and gauge had no effect on flow rates. Water and vitreous flows showed a direct correlation with increasing aspiration levels and % US power (p<0.05).The HV produced consistent water and vitreous flow rates across the range of US power and aspiration levels tested. Hypersonic vitrectomy may be a promising new alternative to the currently available guillotine-based technologies."

Responses were categorized as None, Mild, or Moderate-Severe. Demographics, medical history, sleep disturbances, and cardiometabolic risk factors were evaluated using the 2005-2006 dataset. Variables that demonstrated significant relationships to NLC after adjusting for age, sex, education, and BMI were assessed in the 2007-2008 dataset. Variables that were still significant were entered into a forward stepwise regression model combining both waves, to determine which variables best explained the variance in NLC.Prevalence was 24-25% reporting mild and 6% reporting moderate-severe NLC. NLC increased with age, lower education, unemployment, shorter sleep duration, all assessed sleep symptoms (nocturnal ""leg jerks"", snoring, snorting/gasping, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, non-restorative sleep, sleepiness, use of sleep medications), higher BMI, smoking, medical history (hypertension, heart failure, angina, stroke, arthritis, respiratory disease, and cancer), depression symptoms, and biomarkers (CRP, HbA1c, calcium, cadmium, red blood cells). Stepwise analysis showed that moderate-severe nocturnal leg cramps were associated with (in decreasing order of partial R2): leg jerks, poor overall health, arthritis, difficulty falling asleep, age, nonrestorative sleep, red blood cell count, lower education, angina, and difficulty maintaining sleep.Based on this first large, representative study, NLC occurring >5x per month are reported by 6% of the adult US population. Sleep disturbance symptoms and health conditions are associated with higher frequency of NLC, suggesting that NLC is a marker, and possibly contributor, to poor sleep and general health."
https://openalex.org/W2622129037,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical condition that confers a risk of progression of chronic kidney disease and a high risk of death. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrotic effects of Zhen-Wu-Tang (ZWT) on cisplatin (CIS)-induced renal injury and elucidate the involvement of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the positive effects of Zhen-Wu-Tang on the kidneys. Wistar rats were randomly assigned into six groups of 6 rats each as follows: normal control 1; normal control 2; CIS 1 and CIS 2, which received single intraperitoneal injections of CIS (6 mg/kg); CIS+ZWT 4 and CIS+ZWT 10, which received ZWT (1 ml/100 g/day, ig) starting days after the CIS injection for 4 and 10 days, respectively. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was performed to identify the amelioration of histopathological changes in the kidneys and apoptosis of the renal proximal tubular cells. Picrosirius red staining was used to evaluate renal fibrosis after ZWT treatment. The relationship between ZWT and the upregulation of Nrf2, phosphorylation of Akt, and the downregulation of TGF-β and WNT/β-catenin were determined by Western blotting. At the end of the experiment, serum was isolated from the orbital blood of rats, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels were measured. The results showed that ZWT restored the histological alterations, aberrant collagen deposition in the kidneys and the BUN and Cr levels that were increased by CIS. Treatment with ZWT reduced the expression levels of TGF-β and Wnt and increased the expression levels of Nrf2, PI3K and Akt in the CIS-exposed kidney tissues. Furthermore, ZWT downregulated apoptosis and fibrosis by modulating the expression levels of caspase-3, Bax and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the anti-fibrotic and anti-apoptotic roles of ZWT in CIS-induced experimental kidney injury."

The questionnaire included questions about pregnancy, labour and birth, the postnatal period, the time at which the baby died, and also asked about the post-mortem process.Completed questionnaires were received from 477 women. Overall, 95% of women were asked for consent to a post-mortem, almost half prior to birth, and half by a consultant. The majority of women received written information and felt sufficiently informed, and agreed to a full post-mortem. A third of women had to wait longer than 12 weeks for the post-mortem result and this was the most common theme in the free text comments. Women also commented on the manner of being asked for consent, and wrote about issues related to communication and support. There were significant differences between sociodemographic groups in many of these factors.The inconsistencies in offer and consent to post-mortem following stillbirth suggest inequality in this area. The amount of time that many parents have to wait for post-mortem results is unacceptable and should be prioritised for improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2622471851,"The majority of studies that have examined parental alcohol use and offspring outcomes have either focused on exposure in the antenatal period or from clinical populations. This study sought to examine proximal and distal associations between parental alcohol use and offspring conduct problems and depressive symptoms in a population birth cohort.We used prospective data from a large UK based population cohort (ALSPAC) to investigate the association between parental alcohol use, measured in units, (assessed at ages 4 and 12 years) with childhood conduct trajectories, (assessed on six occasions from 4 to 13.5 years, n = 6,927), and adolescent depressive symptoms (assessed on four occasions from ~13 to ~18 years, n = 5,539). Heavy drinking was defined as ≥21 units per week in mothers and partners who drank 4+ units daily.We found little evidence to support a dose response association between parental alcohol use and offspring outcomes. For example, we found insufficient evidence to support an association between maternal alcohol use at age 4 years and childhood conduct problems (childhood limited: OR = 1.00, 95% CI = .99, 1.01; adolescent onset: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = .98, 1.00; and early-onset persistent: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = .98, 1.00) per 1-unit change in maternal alcohol use compared to those with low levels of conduct problems. We also found insufficient evidence to support an association between maternal alcohol use at age 4 years and adolescent depressive symptoms (intercept: b = .001, 95% CI = -.01, .01, and slope: b = .003, 95% CI = -.03, .03) per 1-unit change in maternal alcohol use. Results remained consistent across amount of alcohol consumed (i.e., number of alcohol units or heavy alcohol use), parent (maternal self-reports or maternal reports of partner's alcohol use), and timing of alcohol use (assessed at age 4 or age 12 years).There is no support for an association between parental alcohol use during childhood and conduct and emotional problems during childhood or adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2622055116,"An imbalance between oxidative stress and antioxidant activity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cigarette smoke, a major risk factor of COPD, induces cellular oxidative stress, but levels of antioxidants such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) are reduced in individuals with severe COPD. In this study, we evaluated the molecular mechanism of reduced HO-1 expression in human bronchial epithelial cells. We found that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) increases HO-1 levels via activation of NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). However, pretreating cells with the protease neutrophil elastase (NE) suppressed the CSE-induced expression of HO-1 mRNA and protein. NE also decreased the sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) level, but did not inhibit CSE-induced nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity of Nrf2. Transfection of cells with a Myc/His-tagged SIRT1 expression vector completely blocked the NE-mediated suppression of HO-1 expression. We further noted that the NE-induced down-regulation of SIRT1 was not due to decreased transcription or proteasomal/lysosomal degradation or loss of solubility. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that NE enters the cell cytoplasm, and we observed that NE directly cleaved SIRT1 in vitro, indicating that SIRT1 levels are decreased via direct degradation by internalized NE. Of note, we observed decreased SIRT1 levels in NE-treated primary human bronchial epithelial cells and in lung homogenates from both smokers and patients with COPD. In conclusion, NE suppresses CSE-induced HO-1 expression by cleaving SIRT1. This finding indicates the importance of cross-talk between oxidative stress and protease responses in the pathogenesis of COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2624479447,"Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania parasite is a global threat to public health and one of the most neglected tropical diseases. Therefore, the discovery of novel drug targets and effective drug is a major challenge and an important goal. Leishmania is an obligate intracellular parasite that alternates between sand fly and human host. To survive and establish infections, Leishmania parasites scavenge and internalize nutrients from the host. Nevertheless, host cells presents mechanism like nutrient restriction to inhibit microbial growth and control infection. Zinc is crucial for cellular growth and disruption in its homeostasis hinders growth and survival in many cells. However, little is known about the role of zinc in Leishmania growth and survival. In this study, the effect of zinc on the growth and survival of L.donovani was analyzed by both Zinc-depletion and Zinc-supplementation using Zinc-specific chelator N, N, N', N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) and Zinc Sulfate (ZnSO4). Treatment of parasites with TPEN rather than ZnSO4 had significantly affected the growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The pre-treatment of promastigotes with TPEN resulted into reduced host-parasite interaction as indicated by decreased association index. Zn depletion resulted into flux in intracellular labile Zn pool and increased in ROS generation correlated with decreased intracellular total thiol and retention of plasma membrane integrity without phosphatidylserine exposure in TPEN treated promastigotes. We also observed that TPEN-induced Zn depletion resulted into collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential which is associated with increase in cytosolic calcium and cytochrome-c. DNA fragmentation analysis showed increased DNA fragments in Zn-depleted cells. In summary, intracellular Zn depletion in the L. donovani promastigotes led to ROS-mediated caspase-independent mitochondrial dysfunction resulting into apoptosis-like cell death. Therefore, cellular zinc homeostasis in Leishmania can be explored for new drug targets and chemotherapeutics to control Leishmanial growth and disease progression."

To this end, anaerobic fungi in the rumen have been identified as a promising source of novel carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) that modify plant cell wall polysaccharides and other complex glycans. Many CAZymes share insufficient sequence identity to characterized proteins from other microbial ecosystems to infer their function; thus presenting challenges to their identification. In this study, four rumen fungal genes (nf2152, nf2215, nf2523, and pr2455) were identified that encode family 39 glycoside hydrolases (GH39s), and have conserved structural features with GH51s. Two recombinant proteins, NF2152 and NF2523, were characterized using a variety of biochemical and structural techniques, and were determined to have distinct catalytic activities. NF2152 releases a single product, β1,2-arabinobiose (Ara2) from sugar beet arabinan (SBA), and β1,2-Ara2 and α-1,2-galactoarabinose (Gal-Ara) from rye arabinoxylan (RAX). NF2523 exclusively releases α-1,2-Gal-Ara from RAX, which represents the first description of a galacto-(α-1,2)-arabinosidase.

https://openalex.org/W2622662710,"A numerical framework for interstitial fluid pressure imaging (IFPI) in biphasic materials is investigated based on three-dimensional nonlinear finite element poroelastic inversion. The objective is to reconstruct the time-harmonic pore-pressure field from tissue excitation in addition to the elastic parameters commonly associated with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). The unknown pressure boundary conditions (PBCs) are estimated using the available full-volume displacement data from MRE. A subzone-based nonlinear inversion (NLI) technique is then used to update mechanical and hydrodynamical properties, given the appropriate subzone PBCs, by solving a pressure forward problem (PFP). The algorithm was evaluated on a single-inclusion phantom in which the elastic property and hydraulic conductivity images were recovered. Pressure field and material property estimates had spatial distributions reflecting their true counterparts in the phantom geometry with RMS errors around 20% for cases with 5% noise, but degraded significantly in both spatial distribution and property values for noise levels > 10%. When both shear moduli and hydraulic conductivity were estimated along with the pressure field, property value error rates were as high as 58%, 85% and 32% for the three quantities, respectively, and their spatial distributions were more distorted. Opportunities for improving the algorithm are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2621447319,"A subset of WD40 proteins with DWD motif has been proposed to serve as substrate receptor of DDB-CUL4-ROC1 complex, thereby getting involved in protein degradation via ubiquitination pathway. Here, we identified a total of 161 potential DWD proteins in soybean (Glycine max) by searching DWD motif against the genome-wide WD40 repeats, and classified them into 20 groups on the basis of their functional domains and annotations. These putative DWD genes in soybean displayed tissue-specific expression patterns, and their genome localization and analysis of evolutionary relationship identified 48 duplicated gene pairs within 161 GmDWDs. Among the 161 soybean DWD proteins, Gm08DWD was previously found to interact with an isoflavonoid regulator, GmMYB176. Therefore, Gm08DWD and its homologue Gm05DWD were further investigated. Expression profile of both genes in different soybean tissues revealed that Gm08DWD was expressed higher in embryo, while Gm05DWD exhibited maximum transcript accumulation in leaf. Our protein-protein interaction studies demonstrated that Gm08DWD interacts with GmMYB176. Although Gm08DWD was localized both in nucleus and cytoplasm, the resulting complex of Gm08DWD and GmMYB176 was mainly observed in the nucleus. This finding is consistent with the functional localization of CUL4-E3 ligase complex. In conclusion, the survey on soybean potential DWD protein is useful reference for the further functional investigation of their DDB1-binding ability. Based on the functional investigation of Gm08DWD, we speculate that protein-protein interaction between Gm08DWD and GmMYB176 may lead to the degradation of GmMYB176 through CUL4-DDB1complex."
https://openalex.org/W2623547472,"The spread of KPC-type carbapenemases is mainly attributed to the global dissemination of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) strains belonging to the clonal group (CG) 258, including sequence type (ST) 258 and other related STs. Two distinct clades of CG258-KP have evolved, which differ mainly for the composition of their capsular polysaccharides, and recent studies indicate that clade 1 evolved from an ancestor of clade 2 by recombination of a genomic fragment carrying the capsular polysaccharide (cps) locus. In this paper, we investigated the ability of two ST258-KP strains, KKBO-1 and KK207-1, selected as representatives of ST258-KP clade 2 and clade 1, respectively, to activate an adaptive immune response using ex vivo-stimulation of PBMC from normal donors as an experimental model. Our data showed that KKBO-1 (clade 2) induces a Th17 response more efficiently than KK207-1 (clade 1): the percentage of CD4+IL17+ cells and the production of IL-17A were significantly higher in cultures with KKBO-1 compared to cultures with KK207-1. While no differences in the rate of bacterial internalization or in the bacteria-induced expression of CD86 and HLA-DR by monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells were revealed, we found that the two strains significantly differ in inducing the production of cytokines involved in the adaptive immune response, as IL-1β, IL-23 and TNF-α, by antigen-presenting cells, with KKBO-1 being a more efficient inducer than KK207-1. The immune responses elicited by KK207-1 were comparable to those elicited by CIP 52.145, a highly virulent K. pneumoniae reference strain known to escape immune-inflammatory responses. Altogether, present results suggest that CG258-KP of the two clades are capable of inducing a different response of adaptive immunity in the human host."
https://openalex.org/W2622194562,"Na+/K+-ATPase transports Na+ and K+ ions across the cell membrane via an ion-binding site becoming alternatively accessible to the intra- and extracellular milieu by conformational transitions that confer marked changes in ion-binding stoichiometry and selectivity. To probe the mechanism of these changes, we used molecular simulation and free-energy perturbation approaches to identify probable protonation states of Na+- and K+-coordinating residues in E1P and E2P conformations of Na+/K+-ATPase. Analysis of these simulations revealed a molecular mechanism responsible for the change in protonation state: the conformation-dependent binding of an anion (a chloride ion in our simulations) to a previously unrecognized cytoplasmic site in the loop between transmembrane helices 8 and 9, which influences the electrostatic potential of the crucial Na+-coordinating residue Asp926. This mechanistic model is consistent with experimental observations and provides a molecular-level picture of how E1P to E2P enzyme conformational transitions are coupled to changes in ion-binding stoichiometry and selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2623733031,"Objective The present study evaluates the effect of food intake on 92 biomarkers for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods Twenty two healthy subjects (11 male and 11 female aged 25.9±4.2 years) were investigated. A total of 92 biomarkers were measured before a standardized meal as well as 30 and 120 minutes afterwards with the Proseek Multiplex CVD III kit. Results The levels for eight biomarkers decreased significantly (P<0.05) 30 minutes after food intake. The levels for seven biomarkers remained significantly decreased 120 minutes after food intake. Nine biomarker decreased significantly at 120 minutes after food intake. The changes were between 4–30%, most commonly around 5%. Only six biomarkers showed a difference of 10% or more due to food intake. The biggest differences were observed for Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (30%); Azurocidin, Cystatin-B, and Myeloperoxidase (13%); Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (11%); and Myeloblastin (10%), all 120 minutes after food intake. Conclusions This study shows that food intake affects several different CVD biomarkers, but the effect is predominantly modest. Timing of blood sampling in relation to food intake, therefore, appears not to be a major concern. Further studies are warranted in older healthy subjects and in patients with various cardiac diseases to determine whether the findings are reproducible."
https://openalex.org/W2623813245,"Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of EDs in women seeking treatment for infertility, and to better characterize their clinical profile. Study design Sixty participants completed self-report measures that assessed EDs, desire for a child, body preoccupations, quality of life, anxiety and depression. Results Ten patients (17%) met criteria for a past or current ED. We showed a significant association between greater body dissatisfaction and a more ambivalent desire for a child. Furthermore, an ED was associated with (i) a lower quality of life, and (ii) more anxiety disorders. Conclusion Screening for a history of ED in infertile women is recommended to plan for adapted care regarding infertility but also regarding ED and psychiatric comorbidities. Therefore, the assessment has to take into account the desire for a child and the body satisfaction, that are essential parts of the ED process on the one hand and infertility process on the other. This could help with the infertility treatment and the prevention of negative maternal and fetal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2623897461,"The Sanjiang Plain (SJP), one of the major rice producing regions in China, is an important source of methane (CH4) emissions. However, there have been large uncertainties in the estimates of CH4 emissions from this area during the past few years. In this study, we estimated CH4 emissions using a process-based model derived by rice area, CH4 flux, land surface temperature (LST), and the ratio of precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET) in rice paddies in the SJP during the rice growing seasons in 2000, 2006, and 2010, respectively. The results showed that the total area of rice fields was 1.64 million ha in 2010, which was approximately 35 and 13% higher than in 2000 and 2006, respectively. The average LST was 22.1°C in 2000 which was higher than in 2006 (21.6°C) and 2010 (21.5°C). Monthly ET and P displayed similar seasonal and annual variability. The monthly ET was 61.7, 66.5, and 63.0 mm month-1 and P was 85.1, 80.6 and 85.9 mm month-1 during the rice growing seasons in 2000, 2006, and 2010, respectively. The averaged CH4 flux rates were 24.83, 24.63, and 24.59 ton km-2, and the estimated mean annual CH4 emissions from rice paddies were 0.30, 0.36, and 0. 40 Tg yr-1 in 2000, 2006, and 2010, respectively. The CH4 emissions displayed obvious spatial variations that decreased from east to west in the SJP, and were mainly affected by temperature. The results will improve our understanding of the inter-annual and spatial variations of CH4 emissions and provide a more accurate regional budget of CH4 emissions from rice paddies in the Sanjiang Plain."
https://openalex.org/W2624558870,"Receptor transporting protein (RTP) family members, RTP1S and RTP2, are accessory proteins to mammalian odorant receptors (ORs). They are expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons and facilitate OR trafficking to the cell-surface membrane and ligand-induced responses in heterologous cells. We previously identified different domains in RTP1S that are important for different stages of OR trafficking, odorant-mediated responses, and interaction with ORs. However, the exact roles of RTP2 and the significance of the requirement of the seemingly redundant co-expression of the two RTP proteins in vivo have received less attention in the past. Here we attempted to dissect the functional differences between RTP1S and RTP2 using a HEK293T cell-based OR heterologous expression system. When a set of 24 ORs were tested against 28 cognate ligands, unlike RTP1S, which always showed a robust ability to support odorant-mediated responses, RTP2 had little or no effect on OR responses and exhibited a suppressive effect over that of RTP1S for a subset of the ORs tested. RTP1S and RTP2 showed no significant difference in OR ligand selectivity and co-transfection with RTP2 increased the detection threshold for some ORs. A protein-protein interaction analysis showed positive interactions among OR, RTP1S, and RTP2, corroborating the functional linkages among the three molecules. Finally, further cell-surface and permeabilized immunocytochemical studies revealed that OR and the co-expressed RTP1S proteins were retained in the Golgi when co-transfected with RTP2, indicating that RTP1S and RTP2 could play different roles in the OR trafficking process. By examining the functional differentiations between the two RTP family members, we provided a molecular level explanation to the suppressive effect exerted by RTP2, shedding light on the divergent mechanisms underlying the RTP proteins in regulating the functional expression of ORs."
https://openalex.org/W2623233699,"Municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration fly ash (IFA) can be potentially reused as a substitute for some raw materials, but treatment for detoxification is indispensable owing to high contents of heavy metals in fly ash. In the present work, due to excessive leaching concentration of lead (Pb), a moderate thermal treatment with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) addition was employed to stabilize Pb in IFA. The moderate thermal treatment was performed under relatively low temperature ranging from 300 to 500°C and at retention time from 1 to 3 h with NaOH addition in a range of 1 to 9%. Leaching results showed that leaching concentrations of Pb in IFA leachates decreased below the standard for hazardous waste identification (5 mg/L) in China under all treatment scenarios. With the increase of temperature, retention time and the amount of NaOH, the concentration of Pb were further suppressed in IFA leachates. Especially, at 500°C for 3 h with 9% NaOH addition, the concentration of Pb dropped to 0.18 mg/L, which was below the standard for sanitary landfill (0.25 mg/L) in China. In thermal process, needle-like crystallites melted to form granules and clumps with compacter structure and less pores. After the thermal treatment, water-soluble and exchangeable fractions of Pb significantly decreased. Therefore, the thermal treatment coupled with NaOH could be applied to realize the environmentally sound management of MSW IFA."
https://openalex.org/W2623287695,"Purpose The prognostic value of serum cystatin-C (Cys-C) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore the prognostic value of Cys-C for RCC patients. Patients and methods The levels of preoperative Cys-C, creatinine (CRE) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) were retrospectively collected in 325 RCC patients undergoing surgery. The cutoff values of Cys-C, CRE and e-GFR were determined by the standardized Cutoff Finder algorithm. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and pairwise comparison were performed to compare the three variables. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate the prognostic value of serum Cys-C in RCC. Results Based on the analysis of Cutoff Finder algorithm, ROC curve and pairwise comparison, the preoperative Cys-C was superior to CRE and e-GFR as a predictive factor in RCC. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that high preoperative Cys-C (>1.09 mg/L) was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in all RCC patients (hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; P = 0.012), patients at pT1-2 (P<0.001), pN0 (P<0.001) and pM0 stages (P<0.001). Moreover, Multivariate Cox regression analyses also showed that in the 306 patients without metastasis, high preoperative Cys-C was also associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 3.50; P = 0.013). Conclusions An elevated preoperative Cys-C level was demonstrated to be related with worse survival in patients with RCC. Measuring preoperative serum Cys-C might be a simple way for finding poor prognostic patients and patients with elevated preoperative Cys-C level should be more closely followed up."
https://openalex.org/W2621872940,"This study aimed to explore the bidirectional relationships between retention and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients from mainland China receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). This prospective cohort study recruited 1,212 eligible MMT patients from the two largest MMT clinics (one privately and another publicly funded) in Xi’an. This study started in March 2012 with a 2-year follow-up until March 2014. Retention was assessed by repeated terminations, past treatment duration, premature terminations, and follow-up treatment duration. HRQoL was evaluated using the Chinese (simple) short-form 36 health survey version 2 (SF-36v2) and the quality of life scale for drug addicts (QOL-DAv2.0). Linear and Cox regression analyses were used to explore relationships between retention and HRQoL. A general linear model was used to further examine the global effect of past treatment duration on HRQoL. Multivariate analyses showed that repeated terminations had no significant impact on HRQoL scores in MMT patients; however, past treatment time (year) influenced the SF-36v2PCS (P = 0.004): treatment for ≥4 years showed a lower SF-36v2PCS score (regression coefficient: -2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.80, -0.97; P = 0.001) than treatment for <1 year. In addition, patients with an SF-36v2PCS score > 49 (hazard ratio: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.98; P = 0.03) were 17% less likely to terminate MMT than those with scores of ≤49. In conclusion, retention and HRQoL tended to have a bidirectional relationship, which should be considered in the development of retention and health-management programs for patients with MMT."
https://openalex.org/W2622385810,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has progressed after first-line therapy is an aggressive disease with few effective therapeutic strategies. In this prospective study, we employed next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify therapeutically actionable alterations to guide treatment for advanced SCLC patients.Twelve patients with SCLC were enrolled after failing platinum-based chemotherapy. Following informed consent, genome-wide exome and RNA-sequencing was performed in a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited environment. Actionable targets were identified and therapeutic recommendations made from a pharmacopeia of FDA-approved drugs. Clinical response to genomically-guided treatment was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.The study completed its accrual goal of 12 evaluable patients. The minimum tumor content for successful NGS was 20%, with a median turnaround time from sample collection to genomics-based treatment recommendation of 27 days. At least two clinically actionable targets were identified in each patient, and six patients (50%) received treatment identified by NGS. Two had partial responses by RECIST 1.1 on a clinical trial involving a PD-1 inhibitor + irinotecan (indicated by MLH1 alteration). The remaining patients had clinical deterioration before NGS recommended therapy could be initiated.Comprehensive genomic profiling using NGS identified clinically-actionable alterations in SCLC patients who progressed on initial therapy. Recommended PD-1 therapy generated partial responses in two patients. Earlier access to NGS guided therapy, along with improved understanding of those SCLC patients likely to respond to immune-based therapies, should help to extend survival in these cases with poor outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2621945846,"Chronic low-grade inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. In the current study, we tested the effects of salsalate, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, in an animal model of inflammation and metabolic syndrome using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) that transgenically express human C-reactive protein (SHR-CRP rats). We treated 15-month-old male transgenic SHR-CRP rats and nontransgenic SHR with salsalate (200 mg/kg/day) mixed as part of a standard diet for 4 weeks. A corresponding untreated control group of male transgenic SHR-CRP and SHR rats were fed a standard diet without salsalate. In the SHR-CRP transgenic strain, salsalate treatment decreased circulating concentrations of the inflammatory markers TNF-α and MCP-1, reduced oxidative stress in the liver and kidney, increased sensitivity of skeletal muscles to insulin action and improved tolerance to glucose. In SHR controls with no CRP-induced inflammation, salsalate treatment reduced body weight, decreased concentrations of serum free fatty acids and total and HDL cholesterol and increased palmitate oxidation and incorporation in brown adipose tissue. Salsalate regulated inflammation by affecting the expression of genes from MAPK signalling and NOD-like receptor signalling pathways and lipid metabolism by affecting hepatic expression of genes that favour lipid oxidation from PPAR-α signalling pathways. These findings suggest that salsalate has metabolic effects beyond suppressing inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2624226232,"Caregiver burnout is a serious concern among informal caregivers, especially for those who provide care to individuals with more severe limitations such as power mobility users. The Power Wheelchair Caregiver Assistive Technology Outcome Measure tool measures device specific and overall burden experienced by informal caregivers of power mobility users. A one-month, test-retest study was conducted to examine the reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity of the Power Wheelchair Caregiver Assistive Technology Outcome Measure. Two construct validity measures were administered: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Late Life Disability Index. The test-retest-reliabilities of part 1 (power wheelchair specific burden) and part 2 (general caregiving burden) were 0.769 and 0.843 respectively. Scores on part 1 were moderately and positively correlated with part 2 and with frequency of participation. Scores on part 2 were moderately and negatively correlated with anxiety, depression, and positively with perceived limitation of participation. The strength and direction of these correlations provide support for the construct validity of the measure and suggest part 1 and part 2 provide complementary information. Further testing is needed to assess the clinical utility and responsiveness of the measure."
https://openalex.org/W2624528971,"Heterostyly is a common floral polymorphism, but the proteomic basis of this trait is still largely unexplored. In this study, self- and cross-pollination of L-morph and S-morph flowers and comparison of embryo sac development in eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) suggested that lower fruit set from S-morph flowers results from stigma-pollen incompatibility. To explore the molecular mechanism underlying heterostyly development, we conducted isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomic analysis of eggplant pistils for L- and S-morph flowers. A total of 5,259 distinct proteins were identified during heterostyly development. Compared S-morph flowers with L-morph, we discovered 57 and 184 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during flower development and maturity, respectively. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reactions were used for nine genes to verify DEPs from the iTRAQ approach. During flower development, DEPs were mainly involved in morphogenesis, biosynthetic processes, and metabolic pathways. At flower maturity, DEPs primarily participated in biosynthetic processes, metabolic pathways, and the formation of ribosomes and proteasomes. Additionally, some proteins associated with senescence and programmed cell death were found to be upregulated in S-morph pistils, which may lead to the lower fruit set in S-morph flowers. Although the exact roles of these related proteins are not yet known, this was the first attempt to use an iTRAQ approach to analyze proteomes of heterostylous eggplant flowers, and these results will provide insights into biochemical events taking place during the development of heterostyly."
https://openalex.org/W2621771062,"ErbB (Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog) receptor tyrosine kinases are critical for tissue development and maintenance, and frequently become oncogenic when mutated or overexpressed. In vitro analysis of ErbB receptor kinases can be difficult because of their large size and poor water solubility. Here we report improved production and assembly of the correctly folded full-length EGF receptor (EGFR) into nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs). NLPs are ~10 nm in diameter discoidal cell membrane mimics composed of apolipoproteins surrounding a lipid bilayer. NLPs containing EGFR were synthesized via incubation of baculovirus-produced recombinant EGFR with apolipoprotein and phosphoplipids under conditions that favor self-assembly. The resulting EGFR-NLPs were the correct size, formed dimers and multimers, had intrinsic autophosphorylation activity, and retained the ability to interact with EGFR-targeted ligands and inhibitors consistent with previously-published in vitro binding affinities. We anticipate rapid adoption of EGFR-NLPs for structural studies of full-length receptors and drug screening, as well as for the in vitro characterization of ErbB heterodimers and disease-relevant mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2624598278,"In this paper, a novel L network (LN) is presented, which is composed of a frequency-selected section (FSS) and a middle stub (MS). Based on the proposed LN, a tri-band T-junction power divider (TTPD) with impedance transformation and independent power division ratios is designed. Moreover, the closed-form design theory of the TTPD is derived based on the transmission line theory and circuit theory. Finally, a microstrip prototype of the TTPD is simulated, fabricated, and measured. The design is for three arbitrarily chosen frequencies, 1 GHz, 1.6 GHz, and 2.35 GHz with the independent power division ratios of 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9. The measured results show that the fabricated prototype is consistent with the simulation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of this proposed design."
https://openalex.org/W2624652055,"The main variables assessed were: answer to complete a target task (wrong or correctly), and percentage gain in the reaction time (RT) to complete a target task correctly depending on whether the prime was a counterfactual or a neutral-control cue. These variables were assessed in 37 patients with schizophrenia and 37 healthy controls. Potential associations with clinical status and socio-demographic characteristics were also explored.When a counterfactual prime was presented, the probability of giving an incorrect answer was lower for the entire sample than when a neutral prime was presented (OR 0.58; CI 95% 0.42 to 0.79), but the schizophrenia patients showed a higher probability than the controls of giving an incorrect answer (OR 3.89; CI 95% 2.0 to 7.6). Both the schizophrenia patients and the controls showed a similar percentage gain in RT to a correct answer of 8%.Challenging the results of previous research, our findings suggest a normal activation of behavioural intentions facilitated by CFT in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, the patients showed more difficulty than the controls with the task, adding support to the concept of CFT as a potential new target for consideration in future therapeutic approaches for this illness."
https://openalex.org/W2622511791,"Natalizumab (NTZ) is a drug that has been widely used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). NTZ is very effective in suppressing inflammation, but if treatment is suspended many patients will experience relapses.To investigate if quantification of γδ T cells and HLA-DR+ NK cells could predict early disease reactivation after NTZ suspension.Absolute counts of γδ T cells and HLA-DR+ NK cells in whole blood were determined with flow cytometry in fifteen patients treated with NTZ. NTZ treatment was then withdrawn and patients were followed with clinical visits and MR investigations.Patients with recurrent disease had higher absolute counts of γδ T cells 129 (±156) cells/μl in comparison to patients with stable disease 50.0 (±51.0) cells/μl but the difference was not statistically significant and largely driven by outliers. Patients with recurrent and stable disease had similar absolute counts of HLA-DR+ NK cells.Quantification of γδ T cells and HLA-DR+ NK cells could not predict active disease after NTZ suspension."
