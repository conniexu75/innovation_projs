https://openalex.org/W3058836816,"The spike protein (S) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is required for cell entry and is the primary focus for vaccine development. In this study, we combined cryo-electron tomography, subtomogram averaging, and molecular dynamics simulations to structurally analyze S in situ. Compared with the recombinant S, the viral S was more heavily glycosylated and occurred mostly in the closed prefusion conformation. We show that the stalk domain of S contains three hinges, giving the head unexpected orientational freedom. We propose that the hinges allow S to scan the host cell surface, shielded from antibodies by an extensive glycan coat. The structure of native S contributes to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially to the development of safe vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3072837421,"Global food demand is rising, and serious questions remain about whether supply can increase sustainably1. Land-based expansion is possible but may exacerbate climate change and biodiversity loss, and compromise the delivery of other ecosystem services2-6. As food from the sea represents only 17% of the current production of edible meat, we ask how much food we can expect the ocean to sustainably produce by 2050. Here we examine the main food-producing sectors in the ocean-wild fisheries, finfish mariculture and bivalve mariculture-to estimate 'sustainable supply curves' that account for ecological, economic, regulatory and technological constraints. We overlay these supply curves with demand scenarios to estimate future seafood production. We find that under our estimated demand shifts and supply scenarios (which account for policy reform and technology improvements), edible food from the sea could increase by 21-44 million tonnes by 2050, a 36-74% increase compared to current yields. This represents 12-25% of the estimated increase in all meat needed to feed 9.8 billion people by 2050. Increases in all three sectors are likely, but are most pronounced for mariculture. Whether these production potentials are realized sustainably will depend on factors such as policy reforms, technological innovation and the extent of future shifts in demand."
https://openalex.org/W3068518905,"Islets derived from stem cells hold promise as a therapy for insulin-dependent diabetes, but there remain challenges towards achieving this goal1-6. Here we generate human islet-like organoids (HILOs) from induced pluripotent stem cells and show that non-canonical WNT4 signalling drives the metabolic maturation necessary for robust ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These functionally mature HILOs contain endocrine-like cell types that, upon transplantation, rapidly re-establish glucose homeostasis in diabetic NOD/SCID mice. Overexpression of the immune checkpoint protein programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protected HILO xenografts such that they were able to restore glucose homeostasis in immune-competent diabetic mice for 50 days. Furthermore, ex vivo stimulation with interferon-γ induced endogenous PD-L1 expression and restricted T cell activation and graft rejection. The generation of glucose-responsive islet-like organoids that are able to avoid immune detection provides a promising alternative to cadaveric and device-dependent therapies in the treatment of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3062227316,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are neurodegenerative disorders that overlap in their clinical presentation, pathology and genetic origin. Autoimmune disorders are also overrepresented in both ALS and FTD, but this remains an unexplained epidemiologic observation1-3. Expansions of a hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) in the C9orf72 gene are the most common cause of familial ALS and FTD (C9-ALS/FTD), and lead to both repeat-containing RNA and dipeptide accumulation, coupled with decreased C9orf72 protein expression in brain and peripheral blood cells4-6. Here we show in mice that loss of C9orf72 from myeloid cells alone is sufficient to recapitulate the age-dependent lymphoid hypertrophy and autoinflammation seen in animals with a complete knockout of C9orf72. Dendritic cells isolated from C9orf72-/- mice show marked early activation of the type I interferon response, and C9orf72-/- myeloid cells are selectively hyperresponsive to activators of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein-a key regulator of the innate immune response to cytosolic DNA. Degradation of STING through the autolysosomal pathway is diminished in C9orf72-/- myeloid cells, and blocking STING suppresses hyperactive type I interferon responses in C9orf72-/- immune cells as well as splenomegaly and inflammation in C9orf72-/- mice. Moreover, mice lacking one or both copies of C9orf72 are more susceptible to experimental autoimmune encephalitis, mirroring the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases seen in people with C9-ALS/FTD. Finally, blood-derived macrophages, whole blood and brain tissue from patients with C9-ALS/FTD all show an elevated type I interferon signature compared with samples from people with sporadic ALS/FTD; this increased interferon response can be suppressed with a STING inhibitor. Collectively, our results suggest that patients with C9-ALS/FTD have an altered immunophenotype because their reduced levels of C9orf72 cannot suppress the inflammation mediated by the induction of type I interferons by STING."
https://openalex.org/W3071340143,"The risk of cancer and associated mortality increases substantially in humans from the age of 65 years onwards1–6. Nonetheless, our understanding of the complex relationship between age and cancer is still in its infancy2,3,7,8. For decades, this link has largely been attributed to increased exposure time to mutagens in older individuals. However, this view does not account for the established role of diet, exercise and small molecules that target the pace of metabolic ageing9–12. Here we show that metabolic alterations that occur with age can produce a systemic environment that favours the progression and aggressiveness of tumours. Specifically, we show that methylmalonic acid (MMA), a by-product of propionate metabolism, is upregulated in the serum of older people and functions as a mediator of tumour progression. We traced this to the ability of MMA to induce SOX4 expression and consequently to elicit transcriptional reprogramming that can endow cancer cells with aggressive properties. Thus, the accumulation of MMA represents a link between ageing and cancer progression, suggesting that MMA is a promising therapeutic target for advanced carcinomas. Ageing in humans is associated with an increase in circulating methylmalonic acid, which induces expression of SOX4 and promotes tumour progression."
https://openalex.org/W3065112399,"It is not known at present whether neuronal cell-type diversity-defined by cell-type-specific anatomical, biophysical, functional and molecular signatures-can be reduced to relatively simple molecular descriptors of neuronal identity1. Here we show, through examination of the expression of all of the conserved homeodomain proteins encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans genome2, that the complete set of 118 neuron classes of C. elegans can be described individually by unique combinations of the expression of homeodomain proteins, thereby providing-to our knowledge-the simplest currently known descriptor of neuronal diversity. Computational and genetic loss-of-function analyses corroborate the notion that homeodomain proteins not only provide unique descriptors of neuron type, but also have a critical role in specifying neuronal identity. We speculate that the pervasive use of homeobox genes in defining unique neuronal identities reflects the evolutionary history of neuronal cell-type specification."
https://openalex.org/W3063215485,"During prophase of the first meiotic division, cells deliberately break their DNA1. These DNA breaks are repaired by homologous recombination, which facilitates proper chromosome segregation and enables the reciprocal exchange of DNA segments between homologous chromosomes2. A pathway that depends on the MLH1–MLH3 (MutLγ) nuclease has been implicated in the biased processing of meiotic recombination intermediates into crossovers by an unknown mechanism3–7. Here we have biochemically reconstituted key elements of this pro-crossover pathway. We show that human MSH4–MSH5 (MutSγ), which supports crossing over8, binds branched recombination intermediates and associates with MutLγ, stabilizing the ensemble at joint molecule structures and adjacent double-stranded DNA. MutSγ directly stimulates DNA cleavage by the MutLγ endonuclease. MutLγ activity is further stimulated by EXO1, but only when MutSγ is present. Replication factor C (RFC) and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) are additional components of the nuclease ensemble, thereby triggering crossing-over. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in which MutLγ cannot interact with PCNA present defects in forming crossovers. Finally, the MutLγ–MutSγ–EXO1–RFC–PCNA nuclease ensemble preferentially cleaves DNA with Holliday junctions, but shows no canonical resolvase activity. Instead, it probably processes meiotic recombination intermediates by nicking double-stranded DNA adjacent to the junction points9. As DNA nicking by MutLγ depends on its co-factors, the asymmetric distribution of MutSγ and RFC–PCNA on meiotic recombination intermediates may drive biased DNA cleavage. This mode of MutLγ nuclease activation might explain crossover-specific processing of Holliday junctions or their precursors in meiotic chromosomes4. Reconstitution of the activation of the MLH1–MLH3 endonuclease shows how crossovers are formed during meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W3053204930,"The inner surfaces of the human heart are covered by a complex network of muscular strands that is thought to be a remnant of embryonic development1,2. The function of these trabeculae in adults and their genetic architecture are unknown. Here we performed a genome-wide association study to investigate image-derived phenotypes of trabeculae using the fractal analysis of trabecular morphology in 18,096 participants of the UK Biobank. We identified 16 significant loci that contain genes associated with haemodynamic phenotypes and regulation of cytoskeletal arborization3,4. Using biomechanical simulations and observational data from human participants, we demonstrate that trabecular morphology is an important determinant of cardiac performance. Through genetic association studies with cardiac disease phenotypes and Mendelian randomization, we find a causal relationship between trabecular morphology and risk of cardiovascular disease. These findings suggest a previously unknown role for myocardial trabeculae in the function of the adult heart, identify conserved pathways that regulate structural complexity and reveal the influence of the myocardial trabeculae on susceptibility to cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W3059956750,"Integral membrane proteins are encoded by approximately 25% of all protein-coding genes1. In eukaryotes, the majority of membrane proteins are inserted, modified and folded at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)2. Research over the past several decades has determined how membrane proteins are targeted to the ER and how individual transmembrane domains (TMDs) are inserted into the lipid bilayer3. By contrast, very little is known about how multi-spanning membrane proteins with several TMDs are assembled within the membrane. During the assembly of TMDs, interactions between polar or charged amino acids typically stabilize the final folded configuration4-8. TMDs with hydrophilic amino acids are likely to be chaperoned during the co-translational biogenesis of membrane proteins; however, ER-resident intramembrane chaperones are poorly defined. Here we identify the PAT complex, an abundant obligate heterodimer of the widely conserved ER-resident membrane proteins CCDC47 and Asterix. The PAT complex engages nascent TMDs that contain unshielded hydrophilic side chains within the lipid bilayer, and it disengages concomitant with substrate folding. Cells that lack either subunit of the PAT complex show reduced biogenesis of numerous multi-spanning membrane proteins. Thus, the PAT complex is an intramembrane chaperone that protects TMDs during assembly to minimize misfolding of multi-spanning membrane proteins and maintain cellular protein homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3067009413,"Single-cell RNA sequencing of embryos can resolve the transcriptional landscape of development at unprecedented resolution. To date, single-cell RNA-sequencing studies of mammalian embryos have focused exclusively on eutherian species. Analysis of mammalian outgroups has the potential to identify deeply conserved lineage specification and pluripotency factors, and can extend our understanding of X dosage compensation. Metatherian (marsupial) mammals diverged from eutherians around 160 million years ago. They exhibit distinctive developmental features, including late implantation1 and imprinted X chromosome inactivation2, which is associated with expression of the XIST-like noncoding RNA RSX3. Here we perform a single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of embryogenesis and X chromosome inactivation in a marsupial, the grey short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica). We resolve the developmental trajectory and transcriptional signatures of the epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm, and identify deeply conserved lineage-specific markers that pre-date the eutherian–marsupial divergence. RSX coating and inactivation of the X chromosome occurs early and rapidly. This observation supports the hypothesis that—in organisms with early X chromosome inactivation—imprinted X chromosome inactivation prevents biallelic X silencing. We identify XSR, an RSX antisense transcript expressed from the active X chromosome, as a candidate for the regulator of imprinted X chromosome inactivation. Our datasets provide insights into the evolution of mammalian embryogenesis and X dosage compensation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of embryogenesis and X chromosome inactivation in the opossum (Monodelphis domestica) resolves the developmental trajectory of a marsupial, and sheds light on the evolution of embryogenesis in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W3074863819,"Most quality control pathways target misfolded proteins to prevent toxic aggregation and neurodegeneration1. Dimerization quality control further improves proteostasis by eliminating complexes of aberrant composition2, but how it detects incorrect subunits remains unknown. Here we provide structural insight into target selection by SCF–FBXL17, a dimerization-quality-control E3 ligase that ubiquitylates and helps to degrade inactive heterodimers of BTB proteins while sparing functional homodimers. We find that SCF–FBXL17 disrupts aberrant BTB dimers that fail to stabilize an intermolecular β-sheet around a highly divergent β-strand of the BTB domain. Complex dissociation allows SCF–FBXL17 to wrap around a single BTB domain, resulting in robust ubiquitylation. SCF–FBXL17 therefore probes both shape and complementarity of BTB domains, a mechanism that is well suited to establish quality control of complex composition for recurrent interaction modules. Structural studies of the dimerization quality control E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF–FBXL17 indicate that its selectivity for aberrant complex formation is based on recognizing both shape and complementarity of interacting domains."
https://openalex.org/W3049092629,"The in vitro formation of stable G-quadruplexes (G4s) in human rRNA was recently reported. However, their formation in cells and their cellular roles were not resolved. Here, by taking a chemical biology approach that integrates results from immunofluorescence, G4 ligands, heme-affinity reagents, and a genetically encoded fluorescent heme sensor, we report that human ribosomes can form G4s in vivo that regulate heme bioavailability. Immunofluorescence experiments indicate that the vast majority of extra-nuclear G4s are associated with rRNA. Moreover, titrating human cells with a G4 ligand alters the ability of ribosomes to bind heme and disrupts cellular heme bioavailability as measured by a genetically encoded fluorescent heme sensor. Overall, these results suggest that ribosomes play a role in regulating heme homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3061413042,"The deregulation of S100A2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several types of cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the protumorigenic capacities of S100A2 have not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrated the molecular mechanisms underlying the roles of S100A2 in glycolysis reprogramming and proliferation of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The results indicated that S100A2 overexpression raises glucose metabolism and proliferation. Mechanistically, S100A2 activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, upregulated GLUT1 expression, induced glycolytic reprogramming, and consequently increased proliferation. Clinical data showed significantly increased S100A2 levels in CRC tissues and the Oncomine database. In addition, analysis revealed a positive correlation between S100A2 and GLUT1 mRNA expression in CRC tissues. Together, these results demonstrate that the S100A2/GLUT1 axis can promote the progression of CRC by modulating glycolytic reprogramming. Our results further suggest that targeting S100A2 could present a promising therapeutic avenue for the prevention of colorectal cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W3049198861,"The HIV-1 Gag protein is responsible for genomic RNA (gRNA) packaging and immature viral particle assembly. Although the presence of gRNA in virions is required for viral infectivity, in its absence, Gag can assemble around cellular RNAs and form particles resembling gRNA-containing particles. When gRNA is expressed, it is selectively packaged despite the presence of excess host RNA, but how it is selectively packaged is not understood. Specific recognition of a gRNA packaging signal (Psi) has been proposed to stimulate the efficient nucleation of viral assembly. However, the heterogeneity of Gag-RNA interactions renders capturing this transient nucleation complex using traditional structural biology approaches challenging. Here, we used native MS to investigate RNA binding of wild-type (WT) Gag and Gag lacking the p6 domain (GagΔp6). Both proteins bind to Psi RNA primarily as dimers, but to a control RNA primarily as monomers. The dimeric complexes on Psi RNA require an intact dimer interface within Gag. GagΔp6 binds to Psi RNA with high specificity in vitro and also selectively packages gRNA in particles produced in mammalian cells. These studies provide direct support for the idea that Gag binding to Psi specifically promotes nucleation of Gag-Gag interactions at the early stages of immature viral particle assembly in a p6-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3080809743,"The application of biomolecular techniques to archaeological materials from the Balkans is providing valuable new information on the prehistory of the region. This is especially relevant for the study of the neolithisation process in SE Europe, which gradually affected the rest of the continent. Here, to answer questions regarding diet and subsistence practices in early farming societies in the central Balkans, we combine organic residue analyses of archaeological pottery, taxonomic and isotopic study of domestic animal remains and biomolecular analyses of human dental calculus. The results from the analyses of the lipid residues from pottery suggest that milk was processed in ceramic vessels. Dairy products were shown to be part of the subsistence strategies of the earliest Neolithic communities in the region but were of varying importance in different areas of the Balkan. Conversely, milk proteins were not detected within the dental calculus. The molecular and isotopic identification of meat, dairy, plants and beeswax in the pottery lipids also provided insights into the diversity of diet in these early Neolithic communities, mainly based on terrestrial resources. We also present the first compound-specific radiocarbon dates for the region, obtained directly from absorbed organic residues extracted from pottery, identified as dairy lipids."
https://openalex.org/W3081434785,"Background In November 2016, the Kenya National Vaccines and Immunization Programme conducted an assessment of missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) using the World Health Organization (WHO) MOV methodology. A MOV includes any contact with health services during which an eligible individual does not receive all the vaccine doses for which he or she is eligible. Methods The MOV assessment in Kenya was conducted in 10 geographically diverse counties, comprising exit interviews with caregivers and knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys with health workers. On the survey dates, which covered a 4-day period in November 2016, all health workers and caregivers visiting the selected health facilities with children <24 months of age were eligible to participate. Health facilities (n = 4 per county) were purposively selected by size, location, ownership, and performance. We calculated the proportion of MOV among children eligible for vaccination and with documented vaccination histories (i.e., from a home-based record or health facility register), and stratified MOV by age and reason for visit. Timeliness of vaccine doses was also calculated. Results We conducted 677 age-eligible children exit interviews and 376 health worker KAP surveys. Of the 558 children with documented vaccination histories, 33% were visiting the health facility for a vaccination visit and 67% were for other reasons. A MOV was seen in 75% (244/324) of children eligible for vaccination with documented vaccination histories, with 57% (186/324) receiving no vaccinations. This included 55% of children visiting for a vaccination visit and 93% visiting for non-vaccination visits. Timeliness for multi-dose vaccine series doses decreased with subsequent doses. Among health workers, 25% (74/291) were unable to correctly identify the national vaccination schedule for vaccines administered during the first year of life. Among health workers who reported administering vaccines as part of their daily work, 39% (55/142) reported that they did not always have the materials they needed for patients seeking immunization services, such as vaccines, syringes, and vaccination recording documents. Conclusions The MOV assessment in Kenya highlighted areas of improvement that could reduce MOV. The results suggest several interventions including standardizing health worker practices, implementing an orientation package for all health workers, and developing a stock management module to reduce stock-outs of vaccines and vaccination-related supplies. To improve vaccination coverage and equity in all counties in Kenya, interventions to reduce MOV should be considered as part of an overall immunization service improvement plan."
https://openalex.org/W3077431776,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal dystrophies characterized by the progressive and irreversible loss of vision. We previously found that intraperitoneal administration of Adalimumab, a monoclonal anti-TNFα antibody, slowed down retinal degeneration in the murine model of RP, the rd10 mice. The aims of this study were to improve its neuroprotective effect and to deepen understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect. We analyzed (i) the in vitro effect of Adalimumab on the TNFα-mediated cell death in retinal cells; (ii) the effect of a single intravitreal injection of Adalimumab on retinal degeneration in rd10 mice at postnatal day (P) 23. In vitro studies showed that TNFα induced caspase and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) activation, downregulation of (kinase receptor-interacting protein 1) RIPK1 and upregulation of RIPK3 in retinal cells. Adalimumab reduced cell death probably through the inhibition of caspase 3 activation. In vivo studies suggested that PARP and NLRP3 inflammasome are mainly activated and to a lesser extent caspase-dependent mechanisms in rd10 retinas at P23. Necroptosis seems to be inhibited by the downregulation of RIPK1. Adalimumab prevented from retinal degeneration without affecting caspase -dependent mechanisms but decreasing PARP activation, microglia activation as well as NLRP3 inflammasome."
https://openalex.org/W3080427227,"Tenascin-C (TNC) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein that plays an important role in cell proliferation, migration, and tumour invasion in various cancers. TNC is one of the main protein overexpressed in breast cancer, indicating a role for this ECM molecule in cancer pathology. In this study we have evaluated the TNC loss-off-function in breast cancer cells. In our approach, we used dsRNA sharing sequence homology with TNC mRNA, called ATN-RNA. We present the data showing the effects of ATN-RNA in MDA-MB-231 cells both in monolayer and three-dimensional culture. Cells treated with ATN-RNA were analyzed for phenotypic alterations in proliferation, migration, adhesion, cell cycle, multi-caspase activation and the involvement in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes. As complementary analysis the oncogenomic portals were used to assess the clinical implication of TNC expression on breast cancer patient’s survival, showing the TNC overexpression associated with a poor survival outcome. Our approach applied first in brain tumors and then in breast cancer cell lines reveals that ATN-RNA significantly diminishes the cell proliferation, migration and additionally, reverses the mesenchymal cells phenotype to the epithelial one. Thus, TNC could be considered as the universal target in different types of tumors, where TNC overexpression is associated with poor prognosis."

We have previously proposed a model of vesicular transport to provide stabilized ACC in chicken uterine fluid where eggshell mineralization takes place. Herein, we report further experimental support for this model. We confirmed the presence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) using transmission EM and showed high levels of mRNA of vesicular markers in the oviduct segments where eggshell mineralization occurs. We also demonstrate that EVs contain ACC in uterine fluid using spectroscopic analysis. Moreover, proteomics and immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of major vesicular, mineralization-specific and eggshell matrix proteins in the uterus and in purified EVs. We propose a comprehensive role for EVs in eggshell mineralization, in which annexins transfer calcium into vesicles and carbonic anhydrase 4 catalyzes the formation of bicarbonate ions (HCO3−), for accumulation of ACC in vesicles. We hypothesize that ACC is stabilized by ovalbumin and/or lysozyme or additional vesicle proteins identified in this study.

Biomineralization is a ubiquitous process by which living organisms produce minerals that they use for many different functions (i.e. protection, gravity sensing) (1Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization. Oxford University Press, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). The formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or phosphate biominerals requires high local concentrations of calcium. Transient amorphous mineral phases that are highly soluble and reactive are a source of ions or a precursor phase for the formation of complex-shaped crystalline biomineral structures. Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is a metastable polymorph of CaCO3, and can provide high concentrations of ions for rapid physiological calcite and aragonite biomineralization (2Ziegler A.

In addition to defense against physical aggression, the eggshell protects the egg contents against microbial contamination, regulates water and gaseous exchange, and is a calcium source for embryonic bone calcification (14Nys Y.

The chicken eggshell is a widely utilized experimental model for biomineralization. Eggshell formation occurs in the distal part of the hen oviduct (red isthmus and uterus) and is one of the fastest known processes of vertebrate biomineralization (16Arias J.L. Fink D.J. Xiao S.Q.

This process requires transport of large amounts of calcium and carbonate to the site of eggshell calcification; these ions are continuously supplied from the blood across the uterine epithelium (24Nys Y.

Alternatively, transport of stabilized ACC mineral in vesicles has been proposed (9Mass T. Giuffre A.J. Sun C.Y. Stifler C.A. Frazier M.J. Neder M. Tamura N. Stan C.V. Marcus M.A. Gilbert P. Amorphous calcium carbonate particles form coral skeletons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28847944): E7670-E767810.1073/pnas.1707890114Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In chicken eggshell mineralization, the important role of ACC has been described (26Rodríguez-Navarro A.B. Marie P. Nys Y. Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Amorphous calcium carbonate controls avian eggshell mineralization: a new paradigm for understanding rapid eggshell calcification.J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 190 (25934395): 291-30310.1016/j.jsb.2015.04.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). During the earliest stage, massive deposits of ACC accumulate at specific nucleation sites (mammillary knobs) on the eggshell membrane. Subsequently, ACC transforms into calcite crystals. Moreover, progressive ACC dissolution continuously supplies local ions to support the rapid growth of columnar calcite crystals that constitute the palisade layer (26Rodríguez-Navarro A.B. Marie P. Nys Y. Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Amorphous calcium carbonate controls avian eggshell mineralization: a new paradigm for understanding rapid eggshell calcification.J. Struct.

In a recent study, we used bioinformatics tools, mRNA levels, and protein quantification to explore the role of EDIL3 and MFGE8 in chicken eggshell biomineralization. We hypothesized that EDIL3 and MFGE8 bind to EVs budding from uterine cells into the uterine fluid, to guide vesicular transport of stabilized ACC for delivery to the mineralizing site and moreover prevent nonspecific precipitation (27Stapane L. Le Roy N. Hincke M.T. Gautron J. The glycoproteins EDIL3 and MFGE8 regulate vesicle-mediated eggshell calcification in a new model for avian biomineralization.J. Biol.

To test this hypothesis, in the current study we have used transmission EM (TEM) to investigate exocytosis activity at the apical plasma membrane of uterine cells that could be a source of EVs in the uterine fluid. We quantified mRNA levels of a variety of validated EV components in the oviduct segments and other tissues. We purified EVs from UF and demonstrated the presence of key vesicular proteins in these vesicles. Finally, spectroscopic techniques (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)) probed for ACC inside these EVs. This experimental study is the first to demonstrate vesicular transport of ACC in vertebrates, which we propose supports the rapid eggshell biomineralization process in birds. The presence of vesicles in the tissues and milieu involved in shell mineralization was investigated by TEM. Ultra-thin negatively stained sections of uterus epithelium were examined by TEM to investigate exocytosis activity adjacent to the luminal site of mineralization (Fig. 1). Uterine-ciliated cells possess numerous vacuolar and vesicular structures as well as dense and light granules (Fig. 1A). At higher magnification (Fig. 1, B–D) we observed vesicles in the cell cytoplasm, their accumulation at the apical plasma membrane, and their budding to generate EVs in the adjacent luminal uterine fluid (Fig. 1, C and D). Fig. 1, E and F, show EVs in the uterine fluid, with vesicle diameters in the 100-400 nm range. Vesicle membranes (rich in glycoproteins, proteins, and lipids) are stained by uranyl acetate and appear bright (high electron-density) versus their interiors that are darker (low electron density). However, some internal regions of vesicles also appeared electron-dense due to mineral deposits (see below). These TEM observations demonstrated the presence of vesicles in the luminal uterine fluid adjacent to the apical region of uterine cells. The uterine epithelium contains ciliated and nonciliated cells, and the same results were observed in proximity to nonciliated cells (data not shown). UF was also examined by TEM (Figure 2, Figure 3), where numerous EVs varying in diameter from 100 to 500 nm were observed (Figs. 2, A and C, and 3A).Figure 3TEM on uterine fluid, EDS and SAED analyses.

Uterine fluid vesicles containing electron dense mineral deposits were observed by TEM and analyzed by EELS (Fig. 2) and EDS (Fig. 3). EELS spectra show characteristics peaks from the calcium L2,3-edge (349.3 and 352.6 eV), carbon K-edge (285.0, 290.3, 295.5, and 301.5 eV), and oxygen K-edge (540.0 eV) (Fig. 2, B and D, Table S1). All carbon K-edge and oxygen K-edge peaks, except 285.0 eV, are characteristics of carbonate groups (28DeVol R.T. Metzler R.A. Kabalah-Amitai L. Pokroy B. Politi Y. Gal A. Addadi L. Weiner S.

Thus, this analysis confirmed that the mineral deposits are calcium carbonate. Moreover, the 285.0 eV peak from the carbon K-edge is characteristic of amorphous carbon (from organics) and of C = C bonds, whereas the two peaks from the oxygen K-edge (534.0 and 545.5 eV) are also specific to C = O bonds (30Macías-Sánchez E. Willinger M.G. Pina C.M. Checa A.G. Transformation of ACC into aragonite and the origin of the nanogranular structure of nacre.Sci. Rep. 2017; 710.1038/s41598-017-12673-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, EELS spectra confirmed the presence in the uterine EVs of an organic phase (phospholipids and proteins) as well as calcium carbonate mineral deposits, although low spectral resolution (0.25 eV) of the EELS detector did not allow differentiating among different polymorphs. However, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of the vesicle mineral deposits showed diffuse rings indicative of the amorphous nature of calcium carbonate mineral (Fig. 3, F and G). To determine the distribution of the organics and CaCO3 mineral deposits, the carbon peak from the organics (237-290 eV) and calcium peaks (324-355 eV) were selected for mapping (Fig. 2, E–H). The carbon and calcium maps showed that the organic phase (C = C) was concentrated at the vesicle periphery (Fig. 2G), whereas calcium was concentrated within the vesicles. Merger of the carbon and calcium maps (Fig. 2H) clearly shows that the EV organic membranes (phospholipid and proteins) enclose the amorphous calcium carbonate mineral deposits. The distribution of calcium, carbon, and oxygen in uterine fluid vesicles were also analyzed using EDS (Fig. 3). Oxygen, carbon, and calcium elements co-localized within EVs (Fig. 3, A–D). A high C background signal is notable, as samples were mounted on carbon-coated TEM grids. The difference between EDS spectrum 1 (EV), spectrum 2 (EV), and spectrum 3 (background) confirmed the presence of significant amounts of calcium and oxygen inside the EVs, compared with the background signal (Fig. 3E). Indeed, calcium and oxygen signals in the EV were 3- to 5-times higher (spectrum 1) than the background (spectrum 3).

Duodenum (D) and kidney (K) exhibit active ion transport activity without any associated calcification. Finally, liver (L) was selected as an important organ involved in general metabolism. Comparisons of quantified mRNA levels in these organs and tissues were displayed using a heat map diagram (Fig. 4). Z-scores are expressed in terms of mean ± S.D. for each gene. Consequently, the color scale indicates the relative variation of each gene in the different tissues. We observed the highest Z-scores in oviduct segments (Ma, WI, RI, and Ut), for 20 vesicular genes (Anxa1, Anxa2, Anxa8, Ap1g1, Cd9, Cd82, Edil3, Hspa8, Itgb1, Pdcd6ip, Rab5a, Rab27a, Sdcbp, Tsg101, Vamp3, Vamp7, Vps4, Vps26a, Ywhah, and Ywhaz) compared with the other tissues (Clusters 6 to 8, Fig. 4). The mRNA level of genes was also analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey pairwise analysis (Table 1). With the notable exception of Ap1g1, all other genes with highest Z-scores in uterus were also significantly different in the same uterine tissue using ANOVA and pairwise analysis (Table 1). Additionally, these statistical tests show that Itgb1, Sdcbp, Vamp7, and Vps4b were also significantly overexpressed in one or several other tissues (bone (B), kidney (K), and duodenum (D)). Anxa5, Anxa11, Ap1g1, Hsp90b, and Rab7a were not differentially expressed in the various tissues tested. Both Rab11a and Slc4a7 were significantly over-expressed in D, whereas Ca2 and Anxa7 were significantly overexpressed in B and K, respectively, to other tissues.

https://openalex.org/W3080793610,"Maple syrup, made by boiling the sap of Acer saccharum, is an important agriculture commodity in eastern Canada and New England. Although the collection season is relatively short, a rich progression in the sensory qualities of maple syrup can occur throughout the season. A risk associated with maple syrup production at the end of a season is the development of off-flavors that result in syrup with little to no commercial value. Maple syrup producers in Canada and the USA call this ‘buddy syrup’. In this study, sugar maple (Acer saccharum) sap was collected in sequential samples through the harvest season from stands across Ontario. Metabolomics analysis of the sap samples was performed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. This revealed an evolution of the chemical composition, mainly occurring 30 days prior to leaf emergence. The major chemical constituent of maple syrup, sucrose, decreased sharply in late season sap, driven by microbial activity. The alditol mannitol increased in late season sap to concentrations ≥2 mg/mL and is likely an indicator of the start of photosynthesis. Amino acids, notably methionine and asparagine were present in higher amounts in late season sap. Non-targeted analysis revealed a series of related compounds that contained quaternary ammonium moieties including choline, hercynine, trigonelline, glycine betaine and carnitine increased in late season sap. These classes of compounds could act as methyl donors during the heating/evaporation of sap into syrup, affecting taste. Based on descriptions of the nature of buddy syrup and an extensive literature on flavors in foods, the amino acids methionine and asparagine were found as likely precursors to the compounds responsible for buddy syrup."
https://openalex.org/W3081478050,"Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems that provide important environmental services, but have been impacted massively in recent years by human activities. Studies of mangroves have focused on their ecology and function at local or landscape scales, but little has been done to understand their broader distributional patterns or the environmental factors that determine those distributions. Species distribution models (SDMs), have been used to estimate potential distributions of hundreds of species, yet no SDM studies to date have assessed mangrove community distributions in Mexico (the country with the fourth largest extent of this ecosystem). We used maximum entropy approaches to model environmental suitability for mangrove species distributions in the country, and to identify the environmental factors most important in determining those distributions. We also evaluated whether this modeling approach is adequate to estimate mangrove distribution as a community across Mexico. Best models were selected based on statistical significance (AUC ratio), predictive performance (omission error of 5%), and model complexity (Akaike criterion); after this evaluation, only one model per species met the three evaluation criteria. Environmental variable sets that included distance to coast yielded significantly better models; variables with strongest contributions included elevation, temperature of the coldest month, and organic carbon content of soil.

Compared with the other DNA glycosylases NEIL1 and NEIL2, Xenopus laevis NEIL3 C terminus has two highly conserved zinc finger motifs containing GRXF residues (designated as Zf-GRF). It has been demonstrated that the minor AP endonuclease APE2 contains only one Zf-GRF motif mediating interaction with single-strand DNA (ssDNA), whereas the major AP endonuclease APE1 does not. It appears that the two NEIL3 Zf-GRF motifs (designated as Zf-GRF repeat) are dispensable for its DNA glycosylase and AP lyase activity; however, the potential function of the NEIL3 Zf-GRF repeat in genome integrity remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate evidence that the NEIL3 Zf-GRF repeat was associated with a higher affinity for shorter ssDNA than one single Zf-GRF motif. Notably, our protein–protein interaction assays show that the NEIL3 Zf-GRF repeat but not one Zf-GRF motif interacted with APE1 but not APE2. We further reveal that APE1 endonuclease activity on ssDNA but not on dsDNA is compromised by a NEIL3 Zf-GRF repeat, whereas one Zf-GRF motif within NEIL3 is not sufficient to prevent such activity of APE1. In addition, COMET assays show that excess NEIL3 Zf-GRF repeat reduces DNA damage in oxidative stress in Xenopus egg extracts. Together, our results suggest a noncanonical role of NEIL3 in genome integrity via its distinct Zf-GRF repeat in suppressing APE1 endonuclease-mediated ssDNA breakage."
https://openalex.org/W3049004938,"Ticks, as blood-sucking parasites, have developed a complex strategy to evade and suppress host immune responses during feeding. The crucial part of this strategy is expression of a broad family of salivary proteins, called Evasins, to neutralize chemokines responsible for cell trafficking and recruitment. However, structural information about Evasins is still scarce, and little is known about the structural determinants of their binding mechanism to chemokines. Here, we studied the structurally uncharacterized Evasin-4, which neutralizes a broad range of CC-motif chemokines, including the chemokine CC-motif ligand 5 (CCL5) involved in atherogenesis. Crystal structures of Evasin-4 and E66S CCL5, an obligatory dimeric variant of CCL5, were determined to a resolution of 1.3–1.8 Å. The Evasin-4 crystal structure revealed an L-shaped architecture formed by an N- and C-terminal subdomain consisting of eight β-strands and an α-helix that adopts a substantially different position compared with closely related Evasin-1. Further investigation into E66S CCL5–Evasin-4 complex formation with NMR spectroscopy showed that residues of the N terminus are involved in binding to CCL5. The peptide derived from the N-terminal region of Evasin-4 possessed nanomolar affinity to CCL5 and inhibited CCL5 activity in monocyte migration assays. This suggests that Evasin-4 derivatives could be used as a starting point for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs.

Ticks are a group of obligatory blood ectoparasites that are found all over the world counting ∼900 species representing three families: soft ticks Argasidae (∼200 species), hard ticks Ixodidae (∼700 species), and monotypic Nuttalliellidae (1Horak I.G.

Although ticks are generally considered to be pests that transmit tick-borne diseases and cause economic losses for animal husbandry, they can be used as a valuable source of new molecules for drug development. Indeed, because of their parasitic nature, ticks have developed numerous bioactive compounds in the course of evolution to avoid immune responses and battle hemostasis while obtaining a blood meal (3Kazimírová M. Štibrániová I. Tick salivary compounds: their role in modulation of host defences and pathogen transmission.Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2013; 3 (23971008): 4310.3389/fcimb.2013.00043Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To achieve this, ticks target almost every key player in the host innate and adaptive immune system such as neutrophils, B and T cells, and dendritic cells (4Stibrániová I. Lahová M. Bartíková P. Immunomodulators in tick saliva and their benefits.Acta Virol. 2013; 57 (23600877): 200-21610.4149/av_2013_02_200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Trafficking and recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and other responsive cells are orchestrated by a family of chemotactic cytokines, termed chemokines. Chemokines constitute the largest family of cytokines and are divided into four subgroups (C, CC, CXC, or CX3C), according to the number and arrangement of conserved cysteines. All but three of the human chemokines fall either in the CC or CXC group and consist of 70–80 amino acids (5Bachelerie F. Ben-Baruch A. Burkhardt A.M. Combadiere C. Farber J.M. Graham G.J. Horuk R.

Disruption of the chemokine signaling system is one of the crucial parts of ticks' strategy to evade immune responses. To neutralize chemokines, ticks secrete small cysteine-rich chemokine-binding proteins in their saliva with no homologues in mammals, termed Evasins (6Bonvin P. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Evasins: therapeutic potential of a new family of chemokine-binding proteins from ticks.Front. Immunol. 2016; 7 (27375615): 20810.3389/fimmu.2016.00208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Evasins can be divided into two structurally unrelated C6 or C8 subfamilies embodying six and eight cysteines, respectively (6Bonvin P. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Evasins: therapeutic potential of a new family of chemokine-binding proteins from ticks.Front. Immunol. 2016; 7 (27375615): 20810.3389/fimmu.2016.00208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). C8-Evasins are high-affinity binders of CC-type chemokines, whereas C6-Evasins bind CXC-type chemokines (7Déruaz M. Frauenschuh A. Alessandri A.L. Dias J.M. Coelho F.M. Russo R.C. Ferreira B.R.

Evasin-1 is a 94–amino acid protein from the C8 subfamily and a high-affinity binder of closely related CCL3, CCL4, and CCL18 CC-motif chemokines. Structures of this protein and its complex with CCL3 have been resolved by X-ray crystallography (13Dias J.M. Losberger C. Déruaz M. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Shaw J.P.

In contrast to the highly selective Evasin-1, its homologue Evasin-4 binds ∼20 CC-chemokines with nanomolar affinity (11Déruaz M. Bonvin P. Severin I.C. Johnson Z. Krohn S. Power C.A.

Among this broad range of chemokines, the chemokine CC-motif ligand 5 (CCL5, also known as RANTES) is of particular interest, because it is one of the most expressed chemokines by activated platelets and plays a prominent role in the development of atherosclerosis (14Koenen R.R. Weber C. Chemokines: established and novel targets in atherosclerosis.EMBO Mol. Med. 2011; 3 (22038924): 713-72510.1002/emmm.201100183Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). CCL5 activates receptors CCR5, CCR3, and CCR1 and mediates monocyte arrest on inflamed endothelium (15Bakogiannis C. Sachse M. Stamatelopoulos K. Stellos K.

CCL5 activity is regulated by formation of CCL5 oligomers (16Liang W.G. Triandafillou C.G. Huang T.Y. Zulueta M.M. Banerjee S. Dinner A.R. Hung S.-C. Tang W.-J.

For example, heterodimerization of CCL5 with CXCL4 (platelet factor 4) has a synergetic effect on monocyte adhesion, whereas disruption of this heterodimer attenuates atherosclerosis development (19Braunersreuther V.

It has been shown that treatment with Evasin-4 reduces cardiac injury and inflammation in mice because of anti-CCL5 activity (19Braunersreuther V. Montecucco F. Pelli G. Galan K. Proudfoot A.E.

Here, we present the crystal structure of Evasin-4 at 1.3 Å resolution, which presents new structural features within the Evasin family members. We also identified the structural determinants of the CCL5–Evasin-4 complex by solution NMR spectroscopy and the inhibitory role of Evasin-4 and its N terminus on CCL5-induced monocyte migration. Evasins are reported to be highly glycosylated when expressed in insects or mammalian cells; however, glycosylation is not crucial for their activity (8Hayward J. Sanchez J. Perry A. Huang C. Rodriguez Valle M. Canals M. Payne R.J. Stone M.J. Ticks from diverse genera encode chemokine-inhibitory evasin proteins.J. Biol.

To obtain a more homogeneous sample for NMR and X-ray studies, Evasin-4 was expressed in a nonglycosylated form in Escherichia coli. The molecular mass of the expressed polypeptide was 11.4 kDa, indicating the retention of the N-terminal methionine in Evasin-4 (designated as met-Evasin-4). Oxidative refolding of this protein led to a decrease in molecular mass of 8 Da, corresponding to the formation of four disulfide bonds. Purification by HPLC yielded 1–1.5 mg of met-Evasin-4 per liter of culture (Fig. S1). In an unsuccessful attempt to increase expression yield, Evasin-4 was expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal His6-SUMO tag, resulting in ∼1 mg/liter of Evasin-4 after cleavage by SUMO protease and subsequent refolding and purification by HPLC (Fig. S2). Both Evasin-4 and met-Evasin-4 were used for further experiments as specified under “Experimental procedures.” To avoid confusion, both variants are called Evasin-4 throughout the manuscript because no structural and functional differences between them are expected. To study Evasin-4's structure by NMR spectroscopy, metabolically 15N- and 13C-enriched Evasin-4 was produced. However, Evasin-4 appeared to be a challenging protein for structure determination by solution NMR spectroscopy because a significant portion of the protein resonances were extremely broadened at 37 °C and pH 7.1. Unfortunately, varying the conditions such as ionic strength, pH, and temperature did not improve the quality of the spectra. In the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of 50 μm [15N,13C] Evasin-4, only ∼40% of the backbone amide peaks could be observed and assigned, namely the Asp12–Ala23, Phe69–Gln80 and His88–Thr93 regions, and several other residues scattered along the sequence (see Fig. S3). To bypass the challenges confronted during NMR experiments, we determined the structure of Evasin-4 by X-ray diffraction. Unlabeled Evasin-4 crystallized in three different crystal forms (Protein Data Bank (PDB) codes 6ST4, 6STC, and 6STE) with the best crystals diffracting to a maximum resolution of 1.3 Å (Table S2). Phasing of the diffraction data by molecular replacement using the closest homologous structure available, Evasin-1 (13) (PDB code 3FPR, 27% sequence identity), as a full template (20McCoy A.J.

In the end, to phase the data, a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected at a wavelength of 1.54 Å. This strategy provided sufficient anomalous signal arising from the eight sulfur atoms of cysteine residues that enabled phasing of the Evasin-4 data. The overall architecture of the Evasin-4 can be divided into an N- and C-terminal subdomain (Fig. 1). Each of the N- and C-terminal subdomains consists of a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet core, in which the sheets are oriented orthogonally with respect to each other, forming an L-shaped structure. The N-terminal β-sheet is formed by β-strands β–β4, whereas the C-terminal β-sheet constitutes β-strands β5–β8. The C-terminal subdomain has a triangle-like twisted-sheet shape with a short α-helix (Ala74–Gln77) within the β5–β6 loop that is positioned away from the rest of the structure (Fig. 1C). The 3D fold of Evasin-4 is tightly arranged by four disulfide bonds and contains a rigid protein core. Three disulfide bonds connect β-strands within a subdomain (Cys27–Cys46 connects β1 and β3, Cys63–Cys94 links β5 and β7, and Cys84–Cys103 connects β6 and β8), whereas the fourth disulfide bond (Cys42–Cys89) joins the N-terminal subdomain with the β6-strand of the C-terminal subdomain. Superposition of all six polypeptide chains of the three Evasin-4 crystal forms showed that the rigid Evasin-4 protein core is flanked by two more flexible protrusions (Fig. 2). The first protrusion is formed by the N-terminal region (Glu16–Leu25) plus the loop β3–β4 (Ser48–Thr51) that extend from the N-terminal β-sheet. The second protrusion extends from the C-terminal β-sheet and consist of the loop β5–β6 (Asp68–Tyr82), including the α-helix (Ala74–Gln77). Residues Glu1–Glu15 are unresolved in all three crystal forms as a result of high flexibility. In addition, loop β5–β6 is unresolved in two of the total six monomers in the three crystals forms (residues Gln72–Asn79 in chain A and Thr71–Gln80 in chain C in crystal form 3; PDB code 6STE).Figure 2The rigid Evasin-4 core is flanked by three more flexible regions.

This interface involves the N-terminal region of Evasin-4 that forms an extended intermolecular antiparallel β-sheet, predominantly involving strand β1 next to strands β3 and β4 of each molecule (Fig. S4). However, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and multiangle light scattering (MALS) analysis in solution (Fig. 3C) show that Evasin-4 is a monomer, indicating that the packing in the crystal may not be physiologically relevant. First, Evasin-4 was analyzed by SEC at a concentration of 0.1 and 1 mg/ml, showing a single peak (Fig. 3A). Addition of 6 m urea did not affect the Evasin-4 peak position, indicating that Evasin-4 remained in the lowest oligomeric state. To identify the molecular mass of Evasin-4 in solution, SEC-MALS analysis was performed. At neutral pH and a concentration of 5.3 mg/ml at injection (which dilutes to 1 mg/ml at elution), Evasin-4 showed a single peak with a molecular mass of 12.9 ± 1.2 kDa (Fig. 3B), which corresponds to a monomeric state (mass of a monomer is 11.3 kDa; Fig. S2). Although the concentration of Evasin-4 when injected into the host blood stream has not been determined yet, the total protein concentration in saliva of another tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, has been reported to range from 1.75 to 3.22 mg/ml (23Tirloni L. Reck J. Terra R.M.S. Martins J.R. Mulenga A. Sherman N.E. Fox J.W. Yates J.R. Termignoni C. Pinto A.F.M. da Silva Vaz I. Proteomic analysis of cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus saliva: a comparison between partially and fully engorged females.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (24762651): e9483110.1371/journal.pone.0094831Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, one can conclude that Evasin-4 is a functional monomer, whereas the observed dimer interactions in the crystal structure are a result of crystal packing. We cannot exclude the possibility that the crystal packing has an effect on the conformation of Evasin-4. However, the overall topology is conserved comparing Evasin-4 with Evasin-1 (Fig. 1C). In addition, the six independent structures of Evasin-4, arising from three different crystal forms we report here, are very similar to each other (Fig. 2), suggesting that the crystal packing does not have major consequences on the overall structure of Evasin-4. CCL5 can oligomerize, forming dimers and oligomers of a higher order (16Liang W.G. Triandafillou C.G. Huang T.Y. Zulueta M.M. Banerjee S. Dinner A.R. Hung S.-C. Tang W.-J.

To prevent higher-order CCL5-oligomerization, the E66S CCL5 mutant was used for further experiments, as it mainly forms dimers at physiological pH (24Czaplewski L.G. Jane McKeating B.C.C.

Although the similar E66A CCL5 mutant also showed deficiency in oligomerization without disturbing Evasin-4 inhibition potency (25Bonvin P. Dunn S.M. Rousseau F. Dyer D.P. Shaw J. Power C.A.

To address this question, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor analysis was performed with biotinylated Evasin-4 as a ligand immobilized on the chip surface. Dimeric E66S CCL5 and a synthetic obligatory CCL5 monomer (Figs. S5 and S6) that has a methylated amide nitrogen at Thr7 ([NMe-7T]CCL5) (26Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P.

E66S CCL5 bound Evasin-4 in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent KD value of ∼42 nm (Fig. 3, C and D). The monomeric [NMe-7T]CCL5 variant was effectively bound by Evasin-4 as well, with an apparent KD value of ∼75 nm. These similar KD values could indicate that the CCL5 monomer is the main Evasin-4 target. For in-depth analysis of the Evasin-4/CCL5 complex, determination of its crystal structure was attempted by X-ray crystallography. Unfortunately, several trials to crystallize Evasin-4 in complex with E66S CCL5 were unsuccessful, primarily because of the precipitation of the complex in solution, even at a low concentration. This could be explained by the large difference in pKi values of Evasin-4 and E66S CCL5 and their limited solubility at different pH. Whereas Evasin-4 is an acidic protein with a theoretical pKi value of 3.8, E66S CCL5 has a basic pKi value of 9.4. This greatly limited the choice of conditions at which both Evasin-4 and E66S CCL5 remained in solution. Although solubility was improved to some extent by increasing the amount of salt in the protein buffer or adding organic solvents such as glycerol, crystals that were obtained in these trials consisted of E66S CCL5 only. These crystals were used to solve the E66S CCL5 structure by X-ray crystallography. As expected, E66S CCL5 formed a dimer and had a structure very similar to that of WT CCL5 with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.63 Å for the backbone of the full-length protein (Fig. S7). This confirmed that the E66S mutation disturbed neither the CCL5 folding nor the formation of a dimer. Because crystals of the E66S CCL5–Evasin-4 complex could not be obtained, NMR spectroscopy was used to further study the complex formation. Addition of E66S CCL5 to [15N,13C]Evasin-4 caused substantial chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) for the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum peaks. NMR spectra of the final E66S CCL5–[15N,13C]Evasin-4 complex showed numerous new resonance signals of Evasin-4 in the complex (Fig. S3B). However, a large number of Evasin-4 resonances in the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum still remain significantly broadened in the complex and could not be assigned by 3D triple resonance spectra or NOESY spectra. Assignment of the observed signals showed that the most perturbed residues are located in the Asp17–Ala23 and Thr33–Ala38 regions, whereas residues of the α-helix and strands β6 and β7 remained unaffected (Fig. 4, A and B). Because most perturbed residues are located in the N-terminal region of Evasin-4, this region could be responsible for chemokine binding. To assess this hypothesis, two peptides taken from the Evasin-4 sequence were synthesized by Boc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis (Figs. S8 and S9). The first peptide, Ev4 Glu14–Ala23, comprises the Glu14–Ala23 residues of Evasin-4, whereas the second one, Ev4 Glu14–Asn31, includes the longer region Glu14–Asn31 (Fig. 4C). Cys27 in the Ev4 Glu14–Asn31 was mutated to alanine to prevent oxidation and formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Affinity of obtained peptides to CCL5 was studied by fluorescence anisotropy using 100 nm of 5(6)-Fam–labeled peptides and human CCL5. Titration of Ev4 Glu14–Asn31 by human CCL5 caused dose-dependent increase of fluorescence anisotropy, whereas addition of CCL5 to the shorter variant Ev4 Glu14–Ala23 had no effect even at concentration of 500 nm (Fig. 4D). The apparent KD value of Ev4 Glu14–Asn31 was calculated to be 69 ± 12 nm. To study the structural determinants of E66S CCL5 involved in Evasin-4 binding, NMR spectra were recorded for the [15N,13C]E66S CCL5–Evasin-4 complex. Initial 15N-1H HSQC spectra of [15N,13C]E66S CCL5 were recorded at pH 4.5 and 37 °C at concentrations of 1 and 20 μm. At 1 μm, E66S CCL5 is present in a monomeric form, whereas at 20 μm, two sets of signals were observed, corresponding to a monomeric and dimeric form (Fig. S10). The chemical perturbation plot of monomer/dimer equilibria obtained from the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of 20 μm E66S CCL5 at pH 4.5, showed that dimerization mostly affected residues of the N-terminal region (Ser4–Ile15), 30s loop (Ser31–Cys34), and β3-strand (Arg47–Cys50) (Fig. 5, A and C). This observation goes in line with the obtained crystal structure because the E66S CCL5 dimer interface is formed by interactions of the N terminus with the 30s loop"

In addition, a more diverse TRAV1-2- MR1-restricted T cell repertoire exists that can possess altered specificity for MR1 antigens. However, the molecular basis of how such TRAV1-2- TCRs interact with MR1-antigen complexes remains unclear. Here, we describe how a TRAV12-2+ TCR (termed D462-E4) recognizes an MR1-antigen complex. We report the crystal structures of the unliganded D462-E4 TCR and its complex with MR1 presenting the riboflavin-based antigen 5-OP-RU. Here, the TRBV29-1 β-chain of the D462-E4 TCR binds over the F'-pocket of MR1, whereby the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3β loop surrounded and projected into the F'-pocket. Nevertheless, the CDR3β loop anchored proximal to the MR1 A'-pocket and mediated direct contact with the 5-OP-RU antigen. The D462-E4 TCR footprint on MR1 contrasted that of the TRAV1-2+ and TRAV36+ TCRs' docking topologies on MR1. Accordingly, diverse MR1-restricted T cell repertoire reveals differential docking modalities on MR1, thus providing greater scope for differing antigen specificities."

Additionally, these three β-barrels have no established bacterial ancestor (17Bay D.C. Hafez M. Young M.J. Court D.A. Phylogenetic and coevolutionary analysis of the β-barrel protein family comprised of mitochondrial porin (VDAC) and Tom40.Biochim. Biophys.

The structural and evolutionary significance of the unique scaffold of mOMPs has been an enigma since the first structural characterization, because odd-stranded barrels are conspicuously absent in their bacterial ancestors. Barrel closure in these structures is achieved through parallel H-bonding between the 1st and 19th strands, which could render this scaffold structurally weaker than antiparallel H-bonding (19Richardson J.S. β-Sheet topology and the relatedness of proteins.Nature. 1977; 268 (329147): 495-50010.1038/268495a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Moreover, the functional requirement of an odd-stranded barrel has remained a recurring controversy (20Hiller S. Abramson J. Mannella C. Wagner G. Zeth K. The 3D structures of VDAC represent a native conformation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35 (20708406): 514-52110.1016/j.tibs.2010.03.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Colombini M.

It is known that the structure and stability of integral membrane proteins such as VDACs are intricately connected with its lipidic membrane. Although mitochondria have evolved by endosymbiosis of archaic bacteria, the OMM architecture is remarkably distinct from its ancestor. More specifically, the lipid composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane of mammalian cells is enriched with phosphatidylcholines (PCs) that constitute >50% w/w of the total OMM lipid, whereas PC lipids are inexistent in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (22van Meer G. Voelker D.R. Feigenson G.W. Membrane lipids: where they are and how they behave.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Hence, we reasoned that the biogenesis and evolutionary selection of a 19-stranded β-barrel over an 18- or 20-stranded counterpart coevolved for functional superiority in the unique PC-enriched mitochondrial lipid milieu and should link its unique structure to a functional role specific to the microenvironment of the mitochondrial outer membrane. In OMPs with an odd number of strands, the first and last strands, which also effect barrel closure, establish parallel hydrogen bonding. However, peptide backbones interacting as antiparallel β-sheets are structurally more stable, withstand more distortions, and establish optimal hydrogen bond lengths and bonding geometry than parallel β-sheets (19Richardson J.S. β-Sheet topology and the relatedness of proteins.Nature. 1977; 268 (329147): 495-50010.1038/268495a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). No study has yet been carried out to address the evolutionary and structural significance of an odd-stranded mOMP. In mitochondria, VDACs are the most abundant mOMPs. They constitute ∼50% of the total protein content of the OMM and are conserved from yeast to humans. They function as metabolite flux channels that primarily carry out selective bidirectional transport of ATP/ADP, NADH/NAD+, nucleotides, Ca2+, other ions, and metabolites in a voltage-dependent manner (8Maurya S.R. Mahalakshmi R. Mitochondrial VDAC2 and cell homeostasis: highlighting hidden structural features and unique functionalities.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos.

Mitochondrial proteins: from biogenesis to functional networks.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Of the three human VDAC isoforms 1, 2, and 3, VDAC isoform 2 (hV2WT) is the only isoform that is indispensable in humans, because it binds and inactivates the Bcl2-homologous antagonist/killer, thereby performing an anti-apoptotic role (25Cheng E.H. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J.

Hence, we chose hV2WT as our model β-barrel to deduce whether its unique 19-stranded β-barrel architecture is also functionally significant. We addressed this by structurally re-engineering the hV2WT scaffold to 16-, 17-, 18-, 20-, and 21-stranded β-barrels. We additionally analyzed the contribution of the lipidic environment in modulating the stability of these scaffolds. For example, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) levels are negligible, and cardiolipin (CL) levels are elevated in the OMM, under physiological homeostatic conditions (27Betaneli V. Petrov E.P. Schwille P.

The role of lipids in VDAC oligomerization.Biophys. J. 2012; 102 (22325275): 523-53110.1016/j.bpj.2011.12.049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Studies also suggest the relocation of CL to the outer leaflet of the OMM as a molecular marker of mitophagy (29Kagan V.E. Chu C.T. Tyurina Y.Y. Cheikhi A. Bayir H.

Because VDAC2 is linked directly with mitostasis and apoptosis (26Chin H.S. Li M.X. Tan I.K.L. Ninnis R.L. Reljic B. Scicluna K. Dagley L.F. Sandow J.J. Kelly G.L. Samson A.L. Chappaz S. Khaw S.L.

We provide molecular evidence that a 19-stranded β-barrel offers a unique physicochemical and functional advantage to mOMPs. We show that the 19-stranded structure is metastable, allowing VDAC2 to establish superior protein–lipid interactions and selective sensitivity toward different lipid headgroups, and is functionally the most proficient. Our findings provide an evolutionary basis for the formation, selection, and divergence of 19-stranded scaffolds exclusively in mitochondria. First, we engineered scaffolds with odd-stranded (17Bay D.C. Hafez M. Young M.J. Court D.A.

We achieved this by strand deletion (V216, V217, or V218) or strand addition (V220 or V221) at the C terminus using the 19-stranded structure as the starting scaffold. The N-terminal strand additional bears the voltage-sensor helix, and the deletion of any one strand (β2–β18) would reverse the directionality of all subsequent β-strands and modify the VDAC scaffold sizably. Therefore, the C-terminal strands were chosen specifically for deletion or duplication to ensure that the engineered barrel structures have the least perturbation in their amino acid interaction network (both hydrophobic protein–lipid and hydrophilic intrapore interactions). These strands also contain the mitochondrial targeting signal (30Jores T. Klinger A. Gross L.E. Kawano S. Flinner N. Duchardt-Ferner E. Wöhnert J. Kalbacher H. Endo T. Schleiff E. Rapaport D.

We have observed previously that hV2WT is stabilized under conditions of bilayer mismatch (32Srivastava S.R. Zadafiya P. Mahalakshmi R. Hydrophobic mismatch modulates stability and plasticity of human mitochondrial VDAC2.Biophys. J. 2018; 115 (30503532): 2386-239410.1016/j.bpj.2018.11.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the influence of the lipidic environment on the stability of hV2WT and the engineered barrels using temperature-mediated barrel unfolding in PC and doped PC–PG and PC–PE membranes. All sample preparations followed rigorous procedures to check for misfolding and aggregation (see “Experimental procedures”). Unfolding of VDAC is coupled with aggregation (33Gupta A. Mahalakshmi R. Helix-strand interaction regulates stability and aggregation of the human mitochondrial membrane protein channel VDAC3.J. Gen. Physiol. 2019; 151 (30674561): 489-50410.1085/jgp.201812272Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Hence, thermal denaturation measurements capture the changes associated with irreversible unfolding and aggregation of VDACs (Fig. 2A and Figs. S2 and S3) (32Srivastava S.R. Zadafiya P. Mahalakshmi R. Hydrophobic mismatch modulates stability and plasticity of human mitochondrial VDAC2.Biophys.

They provide two important parameters, namely (i) Tm, which is the midpoint temperature wherein half the population is unfolded (Fig. S2B); and (ii) ΔHapp, the apparent enthalpy change upon protein unfolding (Fig. 2B). Two other thermal parameters, namely the apparent free energy of unfolding (ΔGU) and change in entropy (ΔS) were also deduced (Fig. S4). Because the nature and number of noncovalent interactions established in the aggregated state of the protein cannot be estimated accurately, entropic changes during VDAC unfolding and interactions formed in the aggregated state were used for qualitative comparisons. The parameters Tm and ΔHapp are influenced by the number of interactions established in the folded barrel, which is expected to increase with protein size. Hence, we calculated the per-residue contribution to the Tm and ΔHapp and compared the results for each protein (Fig. 2, A and B, and Figs. S2 and S3, A and B). The Tm does not vary substantially from V216 to V221 across all lipidic conditions (Fig. S2B). Interestingly, the per-residue enthalpic contribution, indicative of intraprotein and protein–lipid interaction strength, is higher for the 19–21 stranded structures (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2, C–E). In particular, the enthalpic contribution is highest for the 19-stranded hV2WT in PC membranes and is lowered nearly 1.5–fold upon PG or PE doping. Hence, hV2WT structure is sensitive to the lipid headgroup in the membrane. V220, although retaining a high enthalpy, does not exhibit a similar lipid-dependent variation (Fig. 2B). The per-residue apparent ΔGU (Fig. S4B) and ΔS (Fig. S4C) measured from thermal denaturation are in good agreement with our conclusions from the ΔHapp. To understand the source of this enthalpic variation, we generated the engineered structures of V216–V218 from hV2WT in silico (V220 and V221 could not be generated; see “Experimental procedures” for details). Our all-atom molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) reveal that in V216–V218, the strand arrangement with respect to the bilayer axis is altered (Fig. 2C; also see Fig. S6A and Movies SM1–SM3). Here, the strand tilt angle decreases progressively from V216 to hV2WT and could be lower in V220 and V221. A decrease in strand tilt concomitantly lowers the shear number. The latter alters the hydrogen-bonding pattern in the transmembrane region of these β-barrels. We surmise based on the simulations that changes in the number and strength of the H-bonds could contribute significantly to the measured change in enthalpy across these engineered barrels, despite the membrane composition. Another interesting finding from the thermal measurements is how the lipid composition selectively modulates hV2WT inter- and intramolecular interaction, thereby influencing the enthalpic stabilization. Under physiological conditions, the outer mitochondrial membrane is enriched with PC (>50% w/w of the total lipid) and PE (∼30% w/w). Healthy mitochondria lack PG lipids in their OMM, because PG is converted metabolically to CL (23Horvath S.E. Daum G. Lipids of mitochondria.Prog. Lipid Res. 2013; 52 (24007978): 590-61410.1016/j.plipres.2013.07.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the influence of CL doping (0.025%-0.1%) on the thermal stability of hV2WT and the engineered V216-21 variants (Fig. 2, D and E, and Figs. S2A and S3C). An increase in both the Tm (Fig. 2E, top panel) and enthalpy (Fig. 2E, bottom panel) suggests that an increase in CL concomitantly increases the stability of all proteins in proportion to the accessible surface available to the lipid membrane. It is likely that CL nonspecifically interacts with hV2WT and the V2 variants, stabilizing the scaffold by forming better protein–lipid interactions. A corollary to this finding is that lowering of CL in the OMM caused by metabolic defects in CL biosynthesis could concomitantly lower hV2WT stability. Comparing our observations across the various lipids allows us to infer that hV2WT is the only barrel structure that is most sensitive to the PC, PE, and PG levels in the membrane. We find that hV2WT stability is lowered enthalpically by ∼1.5–fold in the presence of PE or PG, when compared with PC membranes. The 19-stranded structure possesses an optimal strand tilt and shear number, which allows hV2WT respond to changes in the lipid microenvironment by altering the scaffold stability. An increase in PG levels and a corresponding lowering of CL in the OMM during apoptosis is known to trigger VDAC oligomerization (27Betaneli V. Petrov E.P. Schwille P. The role of lipids in VDAC oligomerization.Biophys. J. 2012; 102 (22325275): 523-53110.1016/j.bpj.2011.12.049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Considering the specific role of human VDAC2 in apoptosis, a functional switch in the protein function based on cellular physiology might indeed be facilitated chiefly by a 19-stranded β-barrel structure. Using equilibrium thermodynamic measurements, we measured the change in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding (ΔGU0,H2O; ΔGeq) for hV2WT and the engineered barrels. Here, protein unfolding was achieved using guanidine hydrochloride as the chemical perturbant and by incubating the reaction at 25 °C, until equilibrium was achieved in 24 h. The unfolding was monitored using a change in the fluorescence emission profiles of the four intrinsic (interface) tryptophan residues. Unlike thermal unfolding (shown in Fig. 2), chemical denaturation is reversible. Here, hV2WT and its variants exhibit a two-state unfolding transition between the folded and unfolded states without a detectable intermediate (Fig. 3A and Fig. S5A). The ΔGeq thus derived was converted to a per-residue contribution, and the global change in stability was compared in PC and in doped PE or PG lipids (Fig. 3, B–D, and Fig. S5B). Unlike thermal unfolding measurements, we find from the ΔGeq that hV2WT shows selective sensitivity to its lipidic environment. The presence of PE or PG lowers the enthalpy of hV2WT unfolding"

As a result, much research in the field has focused on identifying cellobiohydrolases that are very fast. Cellobiohydrolase A from the bacterium Cellulomonas fimi (CfCel6B) and cellobiohydrolase II from the fungus Trichoderma reesei (TrCel6A) have similar catalytic domains (CDs) and show similar hydrolytic activity. However, TrCel6A and CfCel6B have different cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) and linkers: TrCel6A has a glycosylated peptide linker, whereas CfCel6B's linker consists of three fibronectin type 3 domains. We previously found that TrCel6A's linker plays an important role in increasing the binding rate constant to crystalline cellulose. However, it was not clear whether CfCel6B's linker has similar function. Here we analyze kinetic parameters of CfCel6B using single-molecule fluorescence imaging to compare CfCel6B and TrCel6A. We find that CBD is important for initial binding of CfCel6B, but the contribution of the linker to the binding rate constant or to the dissociation rate constant is minor. The crystal structure of the CfCel6B CD showed longer loops at the entrance and exit of the substrate-binding tunnel compared with TrCel6A CD, which results in higher processivity. Furthermore, CfCel6B CD showed not only fast surface diffusion but also slow processive movement, which is not observed in TrCel6A CD. Combined with the results of a phylogenetic tree analysis, we propose that bacterial cellobiohydrolases are designed to degrade crystalline cellulose using high-affinity CBD and high-processivity CD.

Combined with the results of a phylogenetic tree analysis, we propose that bacterial cellobiohydrolases are designed to degrade crystalline cellulose using high-affinity CBD and high-processivity CD. Cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) play key roles in degradation of crystalline cellulose, which is the homopolymer of β-1,4-linked glucose and fundamental component of plant cell wall (1Teeri T.T. Crystalline cellulose degradation: new insight into the function of cellobiohydrolases.Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 160-16710.1016/S0167-7799(97)01032-9Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (534) Google Scholar). High hydrolytic activity of CBHs against crystalline cellulose is achieved by the unique structure of the catalytic domain (CD), which consists of tunnel-shaped substrate-binding sites covered by loops (2Davies G. Henrissat B. Structures and mechanisms of glycosyl hydrolases.Structure. 1995; 3 (8535779): 853-85910.1016/S0969-2126(01)00220-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). In addition, many CBHs also have the cellulose-binding domain (CBD), and the CD and CBD are connected by the linker region (or domain). The CD and CBD are classified into glycoside hydrolase (GH) and carbohydrate binding module (CBM) families, respectively, according to the amino acid sequences (3Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24270786): D490-D49510.1093/nar/gkt1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar). Although cellulases are classified into GH families 5–12, 44, 45, 48, 51, 74, 124, and 148, CBHs are only included in the members of GH6, 7, 9, and 48. The CBMs, which have flat surfaces for cellulose binding (called as type A CBM), are divided into CBM 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 (4Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Carbohydrate-binding modules: fine-tuning polysaccharide recognition.Biochem. J. 2004; 382 (15214846): 769-78110.1042/BJ20040892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Cellulose is the most abundant biomass on earth and an important carbon source for fungi and bacteria. Cellulose degradation system of fungi has been well-known, and they produce many kinds of multidomain cellulases. Synergistic hydrolytic reactions between GH7 and GH6 CBHs (5Henrissat B. Driguez H. Viet C. Schülein M. Synergism of cellulases from Trichoderma reesei in the degradation of cellulose.Bio/Technology. 1985; 3: 722-72610.1038/nbt0885-722Crossref Scopus (421) Google Scholar) or CBHs and endoglucanases (EGs) have been studied in detail. An important cellulose degradation system of bacteria is cellulosome, which is the large complex of carbohydrate active enzymes anchored to the cell surface. The cellulosome system is employed by anaerobic bacteria, and only GH5, 8, 9, and 48 cellulases are reported as components (6Demain A.L. Newcomb M. Wu J.H. Cellulase, clostridia, and ethanol.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69 (15755956): 124-15410.1128/MMBR.69.1.124-154.2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Another degradation system of bacteria is similar to the fungal one. For example, an actinomycetes Cellulomonas fimi produces free GH6 and GH48 CBHs (7Spertino S. Boatti L. Icardi S. Manfredi M. Cattaneo C. Marengo E. Cavaletto M. Cellulomonas fimi secretomes: in vivo in silico approaches for the lignocellulose bioconversion.J. Biotechnol. 2018; 270 (29409863): 21-2910.1016/j.jbiotec.2018.01.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the process of crystalline cellulose hydrolysis, cellulases first bind on the cellulose surface. However, after the binding, not all cellulases can initiate hydrolysis, because accessible position is limited because of the tight packing of the cellulose chains in the crystal. When a cellulase molecule successfully catches a cellulose chain into the catalytic site, it can form productive complex. In other cases, cellulase binds nonproductively and then dissociates from the cellulose surface without hydrolysis. The unique function of CBH is a unidirectional movement on cellulose surface coupled with processive hydrolysis of the cellulose chain into cellobiose, the minimum repeating unit. The unidirectional movement of CBH has been directly observed by single-molecule imaging techniques recently. For the GH7 CBHs, which is a unique cellulase for fungi, the movement was first proved by high-speed atomic force microscopy (8Igarashi K. Uchihashi T. Koivula A. Wada M. Kimura S. Okamoto T. Penttilä M. Ando T. Samejima M.

Furthermore, the relationship between lengths of the tunnel-like structure of the CD and processivity has been analyzed experimentally and theoretically (10Payne C.M. Jiang W. Shirts M.R. Himmel M.E. Crowley M.F. Beckham G.T. Glycoside hydrolase processivity is directly related to oligosaccharide binding free energy.J. Am. Chem.

Although GH6 CBHs are common enzymes in fungi and bacteria, the movement of GH6 from only an ascomycete Trichoderma reesei (TrCel6A) has been observed by single-molecule fluorescence imaging (12Nakamura A. Tasaki T. Ishiwata D. Yamamoto M. Okuni Y. Visootsat A. Maximilien M. Noji H. Uchiyama T. Samejima M. Igarashi K. Iino R.

Because GH7 CBH hydrolyzes cellulose from reducing end and GH6 CBH hydrolyzes from nonreducing end of the cellulose chain, they show opposite directionality in the processive movements. GH6 CBHs from fungi and bacteria are classified into the same family but are different in many points. First, the tunnel-like structure of the substrate-binding site of bacterial CD is longer than that of fungi CD (13Sandgren M. Wu M. Karkehabadi S. Mitchinson C. Kelemen B.R. Larenas E.A. Ståhlberg J. Hansson H. The structure of a bacterial cellobiohydrolase: the catalytic core of the Thermobifida fusca family GH6 cellobiohydrolase Cel6B.J. Mol.

Therefore, bacterial GH6 CBH was expected to be more processive and less endolytic than fungal GH6 CBH. Second, the CBD and linker region are different. TrCel6A has CBM1-CBD connected to CD by a glycosylated linker region (Fig. 1A). The linker region is expected to be intrinsically disordered, and the interaction of sugars on the linker with the cellulose surface is investigated by the molecular dynamics simulation (14Payne C.M. Resch M.G. Chen L. Crowley M.F. Himmel M.E. Taylor 2nd, L.E. Sandgren M. Ståhlberg J. Stals I. Tan Z. Beckham G.T.

In contrast, GH6 CBH from the bacterium C. fimi (CfCel6B) has CBM2-CBD and three fibronectin type 3 domains (FN3s) as a linker between CD and CBD. Both CBDs have flat surface with hydrophobic residues and are expected to bind on the hydrophobic surface of the crystalline cellulose (15Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Miller R.C. Warren R.A.J.

CfCel6B is previously called CbhA and found as the first enzyme that is similar to the CBH II from T. reesei (another name of TrCel6A) (17Meinke A. Gilkes N.R. Kwan E. Kilburn D.G. Warern R.A.

However, the effects of the different domain composition on the elementary steps of cellulose hydrolysis reaction are still elusive. In this study, by using single-molecule fluorescence imaging, we observed binding and dissociation of full-length CfCel6B and its domains (CD, CBD, and FN3s-CBD) on the crystalline cellulose to clarify the functions of CBD and FN3s. Furthermore, their movements on the crystalline cellulose were analyzed. Combined with crystal structures of the CD from bacterial and fungal GH6 CBHs (CfCel6B and TrCel6A, respectively), we successfully verified correlation between lengths of the tunnel-like structure of the CD and processivity. Furthermore, in our phylogenetic tree analysis, the CDs from bacteria and fungi were clearly separated. The fungal CBHs have glycosylated linker and CBM1, and bacterial CBHs have CBM2 except for the single domain enzymes. Given the difference of domain compositions between bacterial and fungal CBHs, CBM2 of bacterial CBHs compensates for facilitated initial binding on cellulose by glycosylated linkers of fungal CBHs. Our results indicate the difference of a design principle between bacterial CBHs and fungal CBHs. In this study, to conduct single-molecule fluorescence imaging, single free cysteines were introduced on the surface of full-length CfCel6B and its domains. We prepared full-length CfCel6B/V43C (termed as Intact), CD/V43C (CD), FN3s-CBD/V484C (FN3s-CBD), and CBD/T766C (CBD) (Fig. 1A). In addition, a catalytically inactive D188A mutant of full-length CfCel6B/V43C (Inactive), of which catalytic acid aspartate was mutated to alanine, was prepared as a negative control of processive movement coupled with catalysis (Fig. 1B). All of proteins were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using cellulose affinity column or nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. After the labeling of the free cysteine with Cy3-maleimide, hydrolytic activities of Cy3-labeled Intact and Inactive were compared with WT CfCel6B. 500 nM WT hydrolyzed 1 mg ml−1 crystalline cellulose Iα at the rate of 0.068 ± 0.001 s−1, and Intact showed comparative hydrolytic rate (0.059 ± 0.001 s−1). On the other hand, hydrolytic rate of Inactive was very low (0.0080 ± 0.0010 s−1), indicating that Inactive do not have cellulose hydrolytic activity. Then we further compared hydrolytic rates for WT and Intact at various concentrations of crystalline cellulose Iα to determine the Km and kcat values by the fitting with Michaelis–Menten equations (Fig. 2). The plots were fitted well (R2 values for WT and Intact were 0.98 and 0.99, respectively); kcat and Km for WT were 2.8 s−1 and 0.52 mg ml−1, and those for Intact were 2.4 s−1 and 0.51 mg ml−1, respectively. Note that hydrolytic activity was also dependent on enzyme concentration, and 100 nM enzymes were used for these measurements. These results indicated that V43C mutation and labeling with Cy3 do not significantly affect the hydrolytic activity and affinity of CfCel6B against crystalline cellulose. To determine the binding rate constant (kon) for Intact, CD, FN3s-CBD, and CBD, enzymes of picomolar concentrations were dropped on the cover glass sparsely coated with crystalline cellulose microfibrils to clearly observe fluorescence signals from individual molecules. The bindings of enzymes were highly specific to the cellulose microfibrils, and almost no nonspecific bindings to the glass surface were observed. These results indicate that all of the enzymes have correctly folded structures that recognize the surface of crystalline cellulose. The values of kon were calculated as numbers of bound molecules divided by enzyme concentration, length of cellulose microfibril, and observation time (m−1 μm−1 s−1). We could not directly estimate the number of bundles in the cellulose microfibrils from the fluorescence image stained with nanomolar concentrations of enzymes, because of the limit of spatial resolution of optical microscopy. Therefore, we analyzed the distributions of kon (Fig. 3). Distribution of kon for Intact showed single peak at 4.3 × 108m−1 μm−1 s−1. Distributions of kon for CD, FN3s-CBD, and CBD showed multiple peaks, which would correspond to number of bundles in cellulose microfibrils. The distributions were fitted well, and their R2 values were better than 0.93. The smallest peak values for FN3s-CBD and CBD were 2.0 × 108 and 1.5 × 108m−1 μm−1 s−1, respectively. These values were almost half and one-third of that for Intact. On the other hand, distribution of kon for CD showed a smallest peak at 1.7 × 107m−1 μm−1 s−1, which was less than one-twentieth of that for Intact. These results indicate that kon of CfCel6B is highly dependent on the binding of the CBD, and FN3s and CD do not contribute significantly. However, if CD and CBD were connected by FN3s, these two domains seem to bind synergistically, because the kon value for Intact is larger than the simple sum of those for CD and FN3s-CBD. Synergistic binding between CBD with linker region and CD has been also observed in TrCel6A (12Nakamura A. Tasaki T. Ishiwata D. Yamamoto M. Okuni Y. Visootsat A. Maximilien M. Noji H. Uchiyama T.

Distributions of binding times were better fitted by sum of two exponential decay functions than single exponential decay in Intact, FN3-CBD, and CBD (Fig. 4 and Fig. S1), as reported previously for TrCel6A (12Nakamura A. Tasaki T. Ishiwata D. Yamamoto M. Okuni Y. Visootsat A. Maximilien M. Noji H. Uchiyama T. Samejima M. Igarashi K. Iino R.

These results indicate that at least two different binding modes of the enzyme exist. For CD, although the R2 values were same for both fittings, the sum of the two exponential decay functions was used to estimate the fractions of two modes. Fast and slow components of dissociation rate constant (kofffast and koffslow, respectively) for Intact were 0.85 and 0.086 s−1, respectively. The ratios of fast and slow components were 33 and 67% respectively. Those for CD were 1.7 s−1 (81%) and 0.13 s−1 (19%) and increased 1.5–2 times compared with those for Intact. In contrast, koff values and ratios of fast components for FN3s-CBD and CBD were 2.7 s−1 (26%) and 3.1 s−1 (30%), respectively. In addition, those of slow components for FN3s-CBD and CBD were 0.29 s−1 (74%) and 0.47 s−1 (70%), respectively. These koff values were comparable between FN3s-CBD and CBD but increased more than three times compared with those for Intact. These results indicated that cellulose-bound state of CfCel6B is stabilized by CD. We also found that CD showed much higher ratio of fast dissociation (81%) than that of slow dissociation (19%). This result was unique for CD among the four samples (i.e. Intact, CD, FN3s-CBD, and CBD), because the ratios of slow dissociation were almost 70% for the other three samples. The values of the binding rate constant corresponding to the fast and slow components (konfast and konslow, respectively) were estimated from the kon shown in Fig. 3 and the ratio of fast and slow components determined by the koff analysis shown in Fig. 4 (Table 1). Then the values of the dissociation constant (Kd) for the fast and slow components (Kdfast and Kdslow, respectively) were calculated from the ratio of koff to kon (koff/kon). Among them, Kdslow for Intact showed the lowest value (3.0 × 10−10m µm). This value was 20 times lower than that of Kdfast for Intact. The values of Kdfast or Kdslow for FN3s-CBD and CBD were comparable and less than 15 times higher than those of Intact. On the other hand, Kdslow for CD was 133 times higher than that of Intact because of the low value of konslow. The difference of Kdfast values for CD and Intact was 20 times. These results indicate that CBD mainly contributes to the affinity of both fast and slow components of Intact.Table 1Summary of binding-rate, dissociation-rate, and dissociation constantsSamplekonComponentkofffast or koffslowaThe kofffast and koffslow are the fast and slow components of the dissociation rate constant, obtained by the fitting of the distribution of binding time distribution (Fig. 4) with a double exponential decay function.konfast or konslowcThe kon values determined in Fig. 3 were further divided into konfast and konslow by using the ratio of fast and slow components of koff.Kdfast or KdslowdThe Kdfast and Kdslow values were calculated as kofffast/konfast and koffslow/konslow, respectively.ValueRatiobThe ratios of fast and slow components were calculated from the ratio of the area of each fitted exponential decay function.m−1 μm−1s−1s−1%m−1 μm−1 s−1m μmIntact4.3 × 108Fast0.85331.4 × 1086.0 × 10-9Slow0.086672.9 × 1083.0 × 10-10CD1.7 × 107Fast1.7811.4 × 1071.2 × 10-7Slow0.13193.2 × 1064.0 × 10-8FN3s-CBD2.0 × 108Fast2.7265.2 × 1075.2 × 10-8Slow0.29741.5 × 1082.0 × 10-9CBD1.5 × 108Fast3.1304.5 × 1076.9 × 10-8Slow0.47701.1 × 1084.5 × 10-9a The kofffast and koffslow are the fast and slow components of the dissociation rate constant, obtained by the fitting of the distribution of binding time distribution (Fig. 4) with a double exponential decay function.b The ratios of fast and slow components were calculated from the ratio of the area of each fitted exponential decay function.c The kon values determined in Fig. 3 were further divided into konfast and konslow by using the ratio of fast and slow components of koff.d The Kdfast and Kdslow values were calculated as kofffast/konfast and koffslow/konslow, respectively. Open table in a new tab Next, translational rate (ktr) was measured from the distance between first and last positions of movement and moving time (Fig. 5). We used higher laser power density (0.28 µW µm−2) and lower frame rate (1 fps) than those for binding and dissociation analyses, to achieve higher localization precision (4.5 ± 1.5 and 4.6 ± 1.4 nm for the x and y axes, respectively). Distributions of ktr for Intact and CD could be fitted with sum of two Gaussians (R2 values were 0.94 and 0.83, respectively). Peak values for Intact were 11.6 and 25.3 nm s−1, and those for CD were 16.8 and 40.2 nm s−1, respectively. On the other hand, distributions of ktr for Inactive and FN3s-CBD could be fitted with a single Gaussian, and the peak values were 37.9 and 39.8 nm s−1, respectively (R2 values were both 0.82). Some Intact molecules moved more than 10 s, and all of these molecules showed lower ktr near the first peak (Fig. 5, right and top panel). On the other hand, in other samples, no molecule moved more than 10 s (Fig. 5, right panel). These results strongly suggest that Intact molecules that showed a long moving time (>10 s) correspond to those moving processively, and Intact molecules that showed a short moving time (<10 s) are a mixture of those moving processively and diffusing on the cellulose surface. Therefore, the distribution of moving times for Intact was separately fitted to all ranges except for the first bin or the ranges longer than 10 s (Fig. 6). The time constant of moving time for the former was 6.6 s (R2 = 0.94) and that for the latter was 4.6 s (R2 = 0.85). These values were both shorter than the values for TrCel6A (7.7 s in both fittings) previously reported (12Nakamura A. Tasaki T. Ishiwata D. Yamamoto M. Okuni Y. Visootsat A. Maximilien M. Noji H.

The structure of CfCel6B CD was modeled by SWISS-MODEL server based on a GH6 CBH from a bacterium Thermobifida fusca (TfCel6B; PDB code 4AVO) and was used as a template of molecular displacement (13Sandgren M. Wu M. Karkehabadi S. Mitchinson C. Kelemen B.R. Larenas E.A. Ståhlberg J. Hansson H. The structure of a bacterial cellobiohydrolase: the catalytic core of the Thermobifida fusca family GH6 cellobiohydrolase Cel6B.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425 (23220193): 622-63510.1016/j.jmb.2012.11.039Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the determined crystal structure of CfCel6B CD, we confirmed that the Val43, which is close to the N terminus of CfCel6B (without signal peptide) and mutated to Cys in the single-molecule fluorescence imaging, was located in the opposite side of the catalytic site. In the crystal structure, CfCel6B has additional substrate-binding site (subsite) constructed by Trp303 at plus side, the same as TfCel6B (Fig. 7, right panel). This additional subsite is stabilized by two loops (Fig. 7, left panel, shown in blue) which are not found in TrCel6A (Fig. 7, middle panel). Near the product-binding site, a pair of exit loops has been also found in CfCel6B and TfCel6B. The exit loop 1 (shown in green) was capping the end of the substrate-binding tunnel. This exit loop 1 of CfCel6B is 4 amino acids shorter than that of TfCel6B, indicating that the tunnel of CfCel6B is more open than that of TfCel6B. In addition, the exit loop 2 (shown in cyan) of CfCel6B showed more open conformations compared with that of TfCel6B. The conformation of the N-terminal loop of CfCel6B was more open compared with those of TrCel6A and TfCel6B. The serine residue (Ser105, Ser181, and Ser232 in CfCel6B, TrCel6A, and TfCel6B, respectively), which is thought to be important to form a hydrogen bond network among the water molecules and catalytic residues, exists on the N-terminal loop (18Burgin T. Ståhlberg J. Mayes H.B. Advantages of a distant cellulase catalytic base.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29321205): 4680-468710.1074/jbc.RA117.001186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The Ser105 and the N-terminal loop of CfCel6B, crystallized without ligand, stayed outside of the cleft. In contrast, the serine residues interact with the ligand, and the N-terminal loops face to inside of the cleft in the structures of TrCel6A and TfCel6B. The conformational change of the N-terminal loop caused by the interaction with ligand has been reported previously for the GH6 CBH from a basidiomycete (19Tachioka M. Nakamura A. Ishida T. Igarashi K. Samejima M. Crystal structure of a family 6 cellobiohydrolase from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol.

To discuss the relationship between the structure and function of CD, we compared all CDs of GH6 enzymes listed in CAZy database (RRID:SCR_012909), except the enzymes with only patent information or including unknown residues in the sequence. By the structural alignment of X-ray crystal structures and homology modeled structures of CD, five groups were identified (Fig. 8). In the phylogenetic tree diagram, bacterial and fungal cellulases were clearly separated. Interestingly, EGs and CBHs from aerobic bacteria and fungi formed different groups, but those of anaerobic fungi were mixed. Each group showed characteristic domain compositions, although the phylogenetic tree was prepared based on the sequences of only CD (Fig. 8, right panel). For example, fungal EGs did not have CBD, and many of CBHs were constructed by CD and CBM1-CBD with serine- or threonine/proline-rich, glycosylated linker region. Many anaerobic fungal cellulases had a glycosylated linker and two CBM10-CBDs that show ∼6 times weaker affinity than that of CBM2-CBD (20Gill J. Rixon J.E. Bolam D.N. McQueen-Mason S. Simpson P.J.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors collectively called E proteins powerfully suppress the differentiation of ILC2s from bone marrow and thymic progenitors while promoting the development of B and T lymphocytes. How E proteins exert the suppression is not well understood. Here we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms using inducible gain and loss of function approaches in ILC2s and their precursors, respectively. Cross-examination of RNA-seq and ATAC sequencing data obtained at different time points reveals a set of genes that are likely direct targets of E proteins. Consequently, a widespread down-regulation of chromatin accessibility occurs at a later time point, possibly due to the activation of transcriptional repressor genes such as Cbfa2t3 and Jdp2 The large number of genes repressed by gain of E protein function leads to the down-regulation of a transcriptional network important for ILC2 differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3049113625,"Motility in archaea is facilitated by a unique structure termed the archaellum. N-Glycosylation of the major structural proteins (archaellins) is important for their subsequent incorporation into the archaellum filament. The identity of some of these N-glycans has been determined, but archaea exhibit extensive variation in their glycans, meaning that further investigations can shed light not only on the specific details of archaellin structure and function, but also on archaeal glycobiology in general. Here we describe the structural characterization of the N-linked glycan modifications on the archaellins and S-layer protein of Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus, a methanogen that grows optimally at 65 °C. SDS-PAGE and MS analysis revealed that the sheared archaella are composed principally of two of the four predicted archaellins, FlaB1 and FlaB3, which are modified with a branched, heptameric glycan at all N-linked sequons except for the site closest to the N termini of both proteins. NMR analysis of the purified glycan determined the structure to be α-d-glycero-d-manno-Hep3OMe6OMe-(1-3)-[α-GalNAcA3OMe-(1-2)-]-β-Man-(1-4)-[β-GalA3OMe4OAc6CMe-(1-4)-α-GalA-(1-2)-]-α-GalAN-(1-3)-β-GalNAc-Asn. A detailed investigation by hydrophilic interaction liquid ion chromatography-MS discovered the presence of several, less abundant glycan variants, related to but distinct from the main heptameric glycan. In addition, we confirmed that the S-layer protein is modified with the same heptameric glycan, suggesting a common N-glycosylation pathway. The M. thermolithotrophicus archaellin N-linked glycan is larger and more complex than those previously identified on the archaellins of related mesophilic methanogens, Methanococcus voltae and Methanococcus maripaludis This could indicate that the nature of the glycan modification may have a role to play in maintaining stability at elevated temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W3049360709,"A large number of aggressive cancer cell lines display elevated levels of activated Rac1, a small GTPase widely implicated in cytoskeleton reorganization, cell motility, and metastatic dissemination. A commonly accepted methodological approach for detecting Rac1 activation in cancer cells involves the use of a conformation-sensitive antibody that detects the active (GTP-bound) Rac1 without interacting with the GDP-bound inactive form. This antibody has been extensively used in fixed cell immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. Taking advantage of prostate and pancreatic cancer cell models known to have high basal Rac1-GTP levels, here we have established that this antibody does not recognize Rac1 but rather detects the intermediate filament protein vimentin. Indeed, Rac1-null PC3 prostate cancer cells or cancer models with low levels of Rac1 activation still show a high signal with the anti-Rac1-GTP antibody, which is lost upon silencing of vimentin expression. Moreover, this antibody was unable to detect activated Rac1 in membrane ruffles induced by epidermal growth factor stimulation. These results have profound implications for the study of this key GTPase in cancer, particularly because a large number of cancer cell lines with characteristic mesenchymal features show simultaneous up-regulation of vimentin and high basal Rac1-GTP levels when measured biochemically. This misleading correlation can lead to assumptions about the validity of this antibody and inaccurate conclusions that may affect the development of appropriate therapeutic approaches for targeting the Rac1 pathway."

CRIPTO, a GPI-anchored co-receptor for a morphogenic factor Nodal, is a sensitive substrate of PGAP6. PGAP6-mediated shedding of CRIPTO plays a critical role in an early stage of embryogenesis. In contrast, CRYPTIC, a close family member of CRIPTO, is resistant to PGAP6. In this report, chimeras between CRIPTO and CRYPTIC and truncate mutants of PGAP6 were used to demonstrate that the Cripto-1/FRL1/Cryptic domain of CRIPTO is recognized by an N-terminal domain of PGAP6 for processing. We also report that among 56 human GPI-anchored proteins tested, only glypican 3, prostasin, SPACA4, and contactin-1, in addition to CRIPTO, are sensitive to PGAP6, indicating that PGAP6 has a narrow specificity toward various GPI-anchored proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3080633706,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains a leading cause of nosocomial and serious life-threatening infections, and contributes to increased mortality in immunocompromised individuals. P. aeruginosa infection triggers host immune response and often provokes potent inflammatory mediators, which do not necessarily eradicate the causative pathogen. On the other hand, it causes severe airway damage and eventually decreased lung function. Such unfavorable outcomes of inflammatory injury have necessitated the development of novel effective agents that can combat with P. aeruginosa-mediated inflammation. Herein, we investigated the potential of quercetin in regulating P. aeruginosa-induced inflammation, with particular emphasized on the interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Our results showed that quercetin exerted the potent inhibitory activity against the production of IL-1β in macrophages infected by live P. aeruginosa PAO1, without exhibiting cytotoxicity. According to our settings, such the potent inhibitory activity of quercetin was clearly demonstrated through its ability to efficiently inhibit IL-1β during P. aeruginosa infection, pre- or even post-infection. In addition, quercetin strongly suppressed MAPK signaling pathway by inhibiting phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK and JNK2, and molecular docking study supported well with this observation. Moreover, quercetin reduced the NLRP3 expression and inhibited the P. aeruginosa-mediated cleavage of caspase-1 as well as mature IL-1β. These results thus indicated that quercetin inhibition of P. aeruginosa-induced IL-1β production is mediated by suppressing the initial priming step and by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Taken together, our findings demonstrated the promising regulatory activity of quercetin against IL-1β production in P. aeruginosa-infected macrophages, and indicated that quercetin has the potential to be effective as a novel therapeutic agent for treatment of P. aeruginosa-induced inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3081425354,"HIV remains a health challenge worldwide, partly because of the continued development of resistance to drugs. Therefore, it is urgent to find new HIV inhibitors and targets. Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3 family members (APOBEC3) are important host restriction factors that inhibit HIV-1 replication by their cytidine deaminase activity. HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) promotes proteasomal degradation of APOBEC3 proteins by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in which core-binding factor β (CBFβ) is a necessary molecular chaperone. Interrupting the interaction between Vif and CBFβ can release APOBEC3 proteins to inhibit HIV-1 replication and may be useful for developing new drug targets for HIV-1. In this study, we identified a potent small molecule inhibitor CBFβ/Vif-3 (CV-3) of HIV-1 replication by employing structure-based virtual screening using the crystal structure of Vif and CBFβ (PDB: 4N9F) and validated CV-3's antiviral activity. We found that CV-3 specifically inhibited HIV-1 replication (IC50 = 8.16 µm; 50% cytotoxic concentration >100 µm) in nonpermissive lymphocytes. Furthermore, CV-3 treatment rescued APOBEC3 family members (human APOBEC3G (hA3G), hA3C, and hA3F) in the presence of Vif and enabled hA3G packaging into HIV-1 virions, which resulted in Gly-to-Ala hypermutations in viral genomes. Finally, we used FRET to demonstrate that CV-3 inhibited the interaction between Vif and CBFβ by simultaneously forming hydrogen bonds with residues Gln-67, Ile-102, and Arg-131 of CBFβ. These findings demonstrate that CV-3 can effectively inhibit HIV-1 by blocking the interaction between Vif and CBFβ and that this interaction can serve as a new target for developing HIV-1 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3049743091,"S-layer (glyco)-proteins (SLPs) form a nanostructured envelope that covers the surface of different prokaryotes and show immunomodulatory activity. Previously, we have demonstrated that the S-layer glycoprotein from probiotic Lactobacillus kefiri CIDCA 8348 (SLP-8348) is recognized by Mincle (macrophage inducible C-type lectin receptor), and its adjuvanticity depends on the integrity of its glycans. However, the glycan's structure has not been described so far. Herein, we analyze the glycosylation pattern of three SLPs, SLP-8348, SLP-8321, and SLP-5818, and explore how these patterns impact their recognition by C-type lectin receptors and the immunomodulatory effect of the L. kefiri SLPs on antigen-presenting cells. High-performance anion-exchange chromatography-pulse amperometric detector performed after β-elimination showed glucose as the major component in the O-glycans of the three SLPs; however, some differences in the length of hexose chains were observed. No N-glycosylation signals were detected in SLP-8348 and SLP-8321, but SLP-5818 was observed to have two sites carrying complex N-glycans based on a site-specific analysis and a glycomic workflow of the permethylated glycans. SLP-8348 was previously shown to enhance LPS-induced activation on both RAW264.7 macrophages and murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells; we now show that SLP-8321 and SLP-5818 have a similar effect regardless of the differences in their glycosylation patterns. Studies performed with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from C-type lectin receptor-deficient mice revealed that the immunostimulatory activity of SLP-8321 depends on its recognition by Mincle, whereas SLP-5818's effects are dependent on SignR3 (murine ortholog of human DC-SIGN). These findings encourage further investigation of both the potential application of these SLPs as new adjuvants and the protein glycosylation mechanisms in these bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3080694831,"Cyclic peptides are reported to have antibacterial, antifungal, and other bioactivities. Orbitides are a class of cyclic peptides that are small, head-to-tail cyclized, composed of proteinogenic amino acids and lack disulfide bonds; they are also known in several genera of the plant family Rutaceae. Melicope xanthoxyloides is the Australian rain forest tree of the Rutaceae family in which evolidine, the first plant cyclic peptide, was discovered. Evolidine (cyclo-SFLPVNL) has subsequently been all but forgotten in the academic literature, so to redress this we used tandem MS and de novo transcriptomics to rediscover evolidine and decipher its biosynthetic origin from a short precursor just 48 residues in length. We also identified another six M. xanthoxyloides orbitides using the same techniques. These peptides have atypically diverse C termini consisting of residues not recognized by either of the known proteases plants use to macrocyclize peptides, suggesting new cyclizing enzymes await discovery. We examined the structure of two of the novel orbitides by NMR, finding one had a definable structure, whereas the other did not. Mining RNA-seq and whole genome sequencing data from other species of the Rutaceae family revealed that a large and diverse family of peptides is encoded by similar sequences across the family and demonstrates how powerful de novo transcriptomics can be at accelerating the discovery of new peptide families."
https://openalex.org/W3080872741,"Background Cervical cancer is the second most common female reproductive cancer after breast cancer with 84% of the cases in developing countries. A high uptake of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination and screening, and early diagnosis leads to a reduction of incidence and mortality rates. Yet uptake of screening is low in Sub-Saharan Africa and there is an increasing number of women presenting for treatment with advanced disease. Nine women in their twenties die from cervical cancer in Kenya every day. This paper presents the biopsychosocial risk factors that impact on cervical cancer knowledge among Kenyan women aged 15 to 24 years. The findings will highlight opportunities for early interventions to prevent the worrying prediction of an exponential increase by 50% of cervical cancer incidences in the younger age group by 2034. Methods Data from the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) was analysed using complex sample logistic regression to assess biopsychosocial risk factors of knowledge of cervical cancer among young women aged 15 to 24 years (n = 5398). Findings Close to one third of the participants were unaware of cervical cancer with no difference between participants aged 15–19 years (n = 2716) and those aged 20–24 years (n = 2691) (OR = 1; CI = 0.69–1.45). Social predisposing factors, such as lack of education; poverty; living further from a health facility; or never having taken a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test, were significantly associated with lack of awareness of cervical cancer (p<0.001). Young women who did not know where to obtain condoms had an OR of 2.12 (CI 1.72–2.61) for being unaware of cervical cancer. Psychological risk factors, such as low self-efficacy about seeking medical help, and an inability to refuse unsafe sex with husband or partner, perpetuated the low level of awareness about cervical cancer (p<0.001). Conclusions A considerable proportion of young women in Kenya are unaware of cervical cancer which is associated with a variety of social and psychological factors. We argue that the high prevalence of cervical cancer and poor screening rates will continue to prevail among older women if issues that affect young women’s awareness of cervical cancer are not addressed. Given that the Kenyan youth are exposed to HPV due to early sexual encounters and a high prevalence of HIV, targeted interventions are urgently needed to increase the uptake of HPV vaccination and screening."
https://openalex.org/W3080558331,"In French Guiana, the malaria, a parasitic infection transmitted by Anopheline mosquitoes, remains a disease of public health importance. To prevent malaria transmission, the main effective way remains Anopheles control. For an effective control, accurate Anopheles species identification is indispensable to distinguish malaria vectors from non-vectors. Although, morphological and molecular methods are largely used, an innovative tool, based on protein pattern comparisons, the Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption / Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiling, emerged this last decade for arthropod identification. However, the limited mosquito fauna diversity of reference MS spectra remains one of the main drawback for its large usage. The aim of the present study was then to create and to share reference MS spectra for the identification of French Guiana Anopheline species. A total of eight distinct Anopheles species, among which four are malaria vectors, were collected in 6 areas. To improve Anopheles identification, two body parts, legs and thoraxes, were independently submitted to MS for the creation of respective reference MS spectra database (DB). This study underlined that double checking by MS enhanced the Anopheles identification confidence and rate of reliable classification. The sharing of this reference MS spectra DB should make easier Anopheles species monitoring in endemic malaria area to help malaria vector control or elimination programs."

Our findings show a depreciation after an oil price shock in the short-run for any period of time, although the pattern of long-run responses of U.S. EER is diverse across time periods, with an appreciation being observed before the mid-2000s and after the mid-2010s, and a depreciation between both periods. This diversity of response should lead policy makers to react differently in order to counteract such shocks. Furthermore, the reaction of oil price to an appreciation of U.S. EER is negative and different over time, which may generate different adverse effects on investment. The knowledge of such effects may help financial investors to diversify their investments in order to optimize the risk-return profile of their portfolios."
https://openalex.org/W3080846905,"Diet is believed to play a major role in maternal recovery, postpartum weight retention (PPWR) is one of the challenges for Chinese women. However, the association between puerperal women’s diet and PPWR remained unclear and complicated in China. The study assessed the dietary quality of puerperal women using adjusted Chinese Dietary Balance Index-16 (DBI-16) and explored its associations with PPWR. Participants were enrolled in the Mother-Infant Cohort Study of China. Dietary intake and demographic characteristics were obtained by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and a self-designed questionnaire at 0–3 months postpartum. PPWR was calculated by the weight difference at 0-3months and 6-8months postpartum minus pre-pregnancy weight. Dietary quality was assessed using adjusted DBI-16. 316 puerperal women were enrolled. According to adjusted DBI-16, 84.8% of participants had an insufficient dietary intake (vegetables 84.8%, fruits 91.8%, dairy 87.3%, soybean 61.4% and aquatic foods 79.4%, respectively), 67.1% had an excessive intake (cereals 60%, meat 57.3% and eggs 64.9%, respectively), 98.4% had an imbalanced diet consumption. PPWR at 0–3, and 6–8 months were 6.0 (±5.1) kg and 5.2 (±7.7) kg, and the percentage of PPWR (≥5kg) were 63.0% and 52.8% respectively. Multivariable linear regression showed the intake of fish and shrimp at 0–3 months postpartum was negatively associated with PPWR at 6–8 months (β = -0.114, SE = 0.279, p < 0.05). The diet quality of Chinese puerperal women was unreasonable and imbalanced. Fish intake tended to be a favorable factor for postpartum weight loss."

Methods We performed a prospective, comparative, multicenter study of 2 groups of treatment-naive HIV-infected patients (group A, CD4>500 cells/μL, not starting c-ART; and group B, CD4<500 cells/μL, starting c-ART at baseline) and a healthy control group. Laboratory analyses and carotid ultrasound were performed at baseline and at months 12 and 24. The parameters measured were low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle phenotype, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), sCD14, sCD163, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(MCP-1), and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). A linear mixed model based on patient clusters was used to assess differences in biomarkers between the study groups and over time. Results The study population comprised 62 HIV-infected patients (group A, n = 31; group B, n = 31) and 22 controls. Age was 37 (30–43) years, and 81% were men. At baseline, the HIV-infected patients had a worse LDL particle phenotype and higher plasma concentration of sCD14, sCD163, hs-CRP, and LDL-Lp-PLA2 than the controls. At month 12, there was an increase in total cholesterol (p = 0.002), HDL-c (p = 0.003), and Apo A-I (p = 0.049) and a decrease in sCD14 (p = <0.001) and sCD163 (p<0.001), although only in group B. LDL particle size increased in group B at month 24 (p = 0.038). No changes were observed in group A or in the healthy controls. Common carotid intima-media thickness increased in HIV-infected patients at month 24 (Group A p = 0.053; group B p = 0.048). Plasma levels of sCD14, sCD163, and hs-CRP correlated with lipid values. Conclusions In treatment-naive HIV-infected patients, initiation of c-ART was associated with an improvement in LDL particle phenotype and inflammatory/immune biomarkers, reaching values similar to those of the controls. HIV infection was associated with progression of carotid intima-media thickness."
https://openalex.org/W3065513203,"Abnormal lipid droplet (LD) metabolism causes a variety of disorders, especially to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). But the mechanism of abnormal aggregation of LD is still not fully elucidated. Here, Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) screening was employed to identify candidate genes regulating LD metabolism in L02 cell. We analyzed simultaneously the transcriptomics of liver tissues of NAFLD to find potential genes involved in pathogenesis of NAFLD. After integration these data, we found that the expression of 43 candidate genes from the GeCKO screening was also decreased in tissues of NAFLD patients. Many of these 43 overlapping genes have been reported to play an important role in the formation of LD. Subsequently, we focused on CYP46A1, one of 43 candidate genes and mitochondria-related genes. We confirmed that the protein expression of CYP46A1 is deceased in tissues of NAFLD patients. Downregulation or overexpression of CYP46A1 affected LD accumulation in vitro. Deficiency of CYP46A1 impaired mitochondrial morphology and function, which may be responsible for the accumulation of LD. In summary, this study explored regulatory factors of LD accumulation at the whole-genome level, and demonstrated that CYP46A1 regulated LD formation involving in NAFLD pathogenesis. It provides new clues for studying the molecular mechanisms of diseases related to abnormal lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3081197804,"DESS is a formulation widely used to preserve DNA in biological tissue samples. Although it contains three ingredients, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and sodium chloride (NaCl), it is frequently referred to as a DMSO-based preservative. The effectiveness of DESS has been confirmed for a variety of taxa and tissues, however, to our knowledge, the contributions of each component of DESS to DNA preservation have not been evaluated. To address this question, we stored tissues of three aquatic taxa, Mytilus edulis (blue mussel), Faxonius virilis (virile crayfish) and Alitta virens (clam worm) in DESS, each component of DESS individually and solutions containing all combinations of two components of DESS. After storage at room temperature for intervals ranging from one day to six months, we extracted DNA from each tissue and measured the percentage of high molecular weight (HMW) DNA recovered (%R) and normalized HMW DNA yield (nY). Here, HMW DNA is defined as fragments >10 kb. For comparison, we also measured the %R and nY of HMW DNA from extracts of fresh tissues and those stored in 95% EtOH over the same time intervals. We found that in cases where DESS performed most effectively (yielding ≥ 20%R of HMW DNA), all solutions containing EDTA were as or more effective than DESS. Conversely, in cases where DESS performed more poorly, none of the six DESS-variant storage solutions provided better protection of HMW DNA than DESS. Moreover, for all taxa and storage intervals longer than one day, tissues stored in solutions containing DMSO alone, NaCl alone or DMSO and NaCl in combination resulted in %R and nY of HMW DNA significantly lower than those of fresh tissues. These results indicate that for the taxa, solutions and time intervals examined, only EDTA contributed directly to preservation of high molecular weight DNA."
https://openalex.org/W3049274235,"The soluble α-polyglucan glycogen is a central metabolite enabling transient glucose storage to suit cellular energy needs. Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) comprise over 15 entities caused by generalized or tissue-specific defects in enzymes of glycogen metabolism. In several, e.g. in Lafora disease caused by the absence of the glycogen phosphatase laforin or its interacting partner malin, degradation-resistant abnormally structured insoluble glycogen accumulates. Sensitive quantification methods for soluble and insoluble glycogen are critical to research, including therapeutic studies, in such diseases. This paper establishes methodological advancements relevant to glycogen metabolism investigations generally, and GSDs. Introducing a pre-extraction incubation method, we measure degradation-resistant glycogen in as little as 30 mg of skeletal muscle or a single hippocampus from Lafora disease mouse models. The digestion-resistant glycogen correlates with the disease-pathogenic insoluble glycogen and can readily be detected in very young mice where glycogen accumulation has just begun. Second, we establish a high-sensitivity glucose assay with detection of ATP depletion, enabling 1) quantification of α-glucans in cell culture using a medium-throughput assay suitable for assessment of candidate glycogen synthesis inhibitors, and 2) discovery of α-glucan material in healthy human cerebrospinal fluid, establishing a novel methodological platform for biomarker analyses in Lafora disease and other GSDs."
https://openalex.org/W3049742141,"The retina-specific chaperone aryl hydrocarbon interacting protein-like 1 (AIPL1) is essential for the correct assembly of phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6), which is a pivotal effector enzyme for phototransduction and vision because it hydrolyzes cGMP. AIPL1 interacts with the cytokine-inducible ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10, which gets covalently conjugated to hundreds of proteins and targets its conjugation substrates for proteasomal degradation, but whether FAT10 affects PDE6 function or turnover is unknown. Here, we show that FAT10 mRNA is expressed in human retina and identify rod PDE6 as a retina-specific substrate of FAT10 conjugation. We found that AIPL1 stabilizes the FAT10 monomer and the PDE6-FAT10 conjugate. Additionally, we elucidated the functional consequences of PDE6 FAT10ylation. On the one hand, we demonstrate that FAT10 targets PDE6 for proteasomal degradation by formation of a covalent isopeptide linkage. On the other hand, FAT10 inhibits PDE6 cGMP hydrolyzing activity by noncovalently interacting with the PDE6 GAFa and catalytic domains. Therefore, FAT10 may contribute to loss of PDE6 and, as a consequence, degeneration of retinal cells in eye diseases linked to inflammation and inherited blindness-causing mutations in AIPL1."
https://openalex.org/W3063299260,"Chaperones are essential components of the protein homeostasis network. There is a growing interest in optimizing chaperone function, but exactly how to achieve this aim is unclear. Here, using a model chaperone, the bacterial protein Spy, we demonstrate that substitutions that alter the electrostatic potential of Spy's concave, client-binding surface enhance Spy's anti-aggregation activity. We show that this strategy is more efficient than one that enhances the hydrophobicity of Spy's surface. Our findings thus challenge the traditional notion that hydrophobic interactions are the major driving forces that guide chaperone-substrate binding. Kinetic data revealed that both charge- and hydrophobicity-enhanced Spy variants release clients more slowly, resulting in a greater ""holdase"" activity. However, increasing short-range hydrophobic interactions deleteriously affected Spy's ability to capture substrates, thus reducing its in vitro chaperone activity toward fast-aggregating substrates. Our strategy in chaperone surface engineering therefore sought to fine-tune the different molecular forces involved in chaperone-substrate interactions rather than focusing on enhancing hydrophobic interactions. These results improve our understanding of the mechanistic basis of chaperone-client interactions and illustrate how protein surface-based mutational strategies can facilitate the rational improvement of molecular chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W3072213960,"We investigated the biochemical and biophysical properties of one of the four alternative exon-encoded regions within the Drosophila myosin catalytic domain. This region is encoded by alternative exons 3a and 3b and includes part of the N-terminal β-barrel. Chimeric myosin constructs (IFI-3a and EMB-3b) were generated by exchanging the exon 3–encoded areas between native slow embryonic body wall (EMB) and fast indirect flight muscle myosin isoforms (IFI). We found that this exchange alters the kinetic properties of the myosin S1 head. The ADP release rate (k-D) in the absence of actin is completely reversed for each chimera compared with the native isoforms. Steady-state data also suggest a reciprocal shift, with basal and actin-activated ATPase activity of IFI-3a showing reduced values compared with wild-type (WT) IFI, whereas for EMB-3b these values are increased compared with wild-type (WT) EMB. In the presence of actin, ADP affinity (KAD) is unchanged for IFI-3a, compared with IFI, but ADP affinity for EMB-3b is increased, compared with EMB, and shifted toward IFI values.

Muscle myosin isoforms display a large variety in kinetic properties and force production, despite their sequences being highly conserved. The various isoforms of Drosophila mel-an-o-gas-ter muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) are encoded by a single gene (Mhc) and expressed using alternative splicing (1George E.L. Ober M.B. Emerson C.P. Functional domains of the Drosophila melanogaster muscle myosin heavy-chain gene are encoded by alternatively spliced exons.Mol.

The first four of the six alternative exon sets (exons 3, 7, 9, and 11) encode regions located in the myosin head domain (2Bernstein S.I. Milligan R.A. Fine tuning a molecular motor: The location of alternative domains in the Drosophila myosin head.J. Mol.

Two native myosin isoforms that differ in all four alternative regions in the head domain display very different kinetic and mechanical properties. The EMB (embryonic) myosin isoform is found in the embryonic body wall muscle, which is used for slow locomotion of the larvae, whereas the IFI (indirect flight muscle isoform) myosin is present in the muscle that can generate very high wing beat frequencies and enables flight. Transgenic expression of EMB in the indirect flight muscle resulted in loss of flight ability (3Wells L. Edwards K.A. Bernstein S.I.

Exchange of the variable regions between IFI and EMB has been used as a strategy to estimate the effect of each alternative domain on muscle myosin kinetics and mechanics. Here we focus on the variable region near the N terminus of MHC, encoded by exon 3. Two alternative regions, encoded by exons 3a and 3b, are expressed in Drosophila myosin and their sequences are shown in Fig. 1B. EMB contains the region encoded by exon 3a, whereas the exon 3b encoded sequence is normally expressed within IFI. Previous work found that exchange of the exon 3 regions between IFI and EMB significantly changes the steady-state kinetic properties of both Drosophila muscle myosin isoforms. Inserting the exon 3a area into IFI resulted in significantly reduced ATPase rates and Vmax for IFI-3a (compared with IFI), whereas inserting the exon 3b region into EMB had surprisingly little effect on ATPase and Vmax of EMB-3b (compared with EMB) (7Swank D.M.

A follow-up study found that IFI-3a Drosophila showed a reduction in both maximum power generation (Pmax) and optimal frequency for power production (fmax), whereas for EMB-3b Drosophila an increase in both Pmax and fmax was found (8Swank D.M. Kronert W.A. Bernstein S.I. Maughan D.W. Alternative N-terminal regions of Drosophila myosin heavy chain tune muscle kinetics for optimal power output.Biophys.

Based on these results it was suggested that the exon 3 region can influence at least two steps of the crossbridge cycle independently, thereby fine-tuning myosin muscle kinetics for optimal force generation. To understand the biochemical kinetics of various steps in the crossbridge cycle that are influenced by the exon 3 domain, we have now performed steady-state and transient kinetics measurements using the exon 3 chimeric myosin S1 isoforms (IFI-3a and EMB-3b). Our data show that exchange of this variable N-terminal area significantly alters the kinetic properties of the myosin S1 head. The catalytic activity kcat of the myosin S1 samples generated from all full-length molecules (IFI, EMB, EMB-3b, and IFI-3a) followed the trend of activities so far observed for the full-length molecules. Interestingly, the ADP release rate (k-D) in the absence of actin is completely reversed for both chimeras, compared with their WT backbones. In the presence of actin, the ADP affinity (KAD) is unchanged for IFI-3a, whereas ADP affinity for EMB-3b is increased and shifted toward IFI values. ATP-induced dissociation of acto-S1 (K1k+2) is reduced for both exon 3 chimeras. Detailed analysis of a recently published crystal structure for EMB (9Caldwell J.T. Mermelstein D.J. Walker R.C.

The ATP-induced dissociation of the acto-S1 complex was measured as described previously (10Bloemink M.J. Dambacher C.M. Knowles A.F. Melkani G.C. Geeves M.A. Bernstein S.I.

Plotting the observed rate constant kobs versus ATP concentration allows the apparent second-order rate constant K1k+2 to be determined from the slope of the graph. Example traces of the measured light scattering data are shown in Fig. 2A for EMB-3b after ATP release. The analyzed data are depicted in Fig. 2B for the two exon 3 chimeras, together with IFI and EMB WT (see also Table 1). The measured K1k+2 value of EMB-3b (0.71 ± 0.12 μm−1s−1) is significantly lower compared with EMB (p < 0.007) (Table 1) but not significantly different from the value previously recorded for IFI (0.75 ± 0.08 μm−1s−1). For IFI-3a, a significantly lower K1k+2 value (0.66 ± 0.08 μm−1s−1) compared with IFI was recorded using an unpaired t test (p < 0.04) (Table 1), although this difference did not reach statistical significance using a more stringent one-way Welch's ANOVA that compared all four constructs. Thus, introduction of the IFI version of the exon 3 region into EMB shifted the ATP-induced dissociation of EMB-3b toward IFI values, whereas the presence of the EMB version of the exon 3 region did not shift IFI-3a toward WT EMB levels.Table 1Kinetic parameters measured for myosin S1 isoforms and the exon 3 chimeras using flash photolysisIFI†Data are from Ref. 5, except kcat.EMB†Data are from Ref. 5, except kcat.IFI-3aEMB-3bK1k+2 (μm−1s−1)0.75 ± 0.080.91 ± 0.130.66 ± 0.08aStatistically different compared with IFI, p < 0.04 by t test, but did not reach statistical significance using Welch's one-way ANOVA.0.71 ± 0.12bStatistically different compared with EMB, p < 0.007.KAD (μm)409 ± 26587 ± 48409 ± 18496 ± 79cStatistically different compared with EMB, p < 0.04 by t test, but did not reach statistical significance using Welch's one-way ANOVA.k-AD (s−1)dData are estimated from KAD assuming an association rate constant of 107 M−1 s−1.4090587040904960KD (μm)eData are estimated from k-D assuming an association rate constant of 106m−1 s−1.7.51.82.17.0k-D (s−1)7.5 ± 1.31.8 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.41fStatistically different compared with IFI, p < 0.0001.7.0 ± 1.3gStatistically different compared with EMB, p < 0.0001.KAD/KD54.532619470.9kcat (s−1)hActin is not at saturating conditions.0.170 ± 0.006iData from Ref. 10.0.028 ± 0.006iData from Ref. 10.0.057 ± 0.0030.021 ± 0.009† Data are from Ref. 5Miller B.M.

ATP-induced dissociation of acto-S1 was measured in the presence of increasing amounts of ADP. Fig. 2C shows example traces of the light scattering data for EMB-3b, recorded with increasing ADP concentration. The amplitude of the signal drops as the ADP concentration increases. From the light scattering signals, kobs can be obtained by fitting to a single exponential and plotting kobs versus ADP concentration, which allows KAD to be estimated. The data show that the measured value for the embryonic chimera EMB-3b (KAD = 496 ± 79 μm) is significantly lower, as assessed by t test, compared with the WT EMB value (KAD = 587 ± 48 μm), suggesting a tighter ADP-binding affinity for EMB-3b (Fig. 2C), although this did not reach statistical significance using Welch's one-way ANOVA. The measured value of KAD for IFI-3a (KAD = 409 ± 18 μm) is not significantly different from the WT IFI value (see Table 1). To estimate the rate constant of ADP dissociation from S1 in the absence of actin, the change in fluorescence of a coumarin-labeled ADP analog (eda-deac ADP) (11Webb M.R. Corrie J.E.T. Fluorescent coumarin-labeled nucleotides to measure ADP release from actomyosin.Biophys.

Nyitrai M. Webb M.R. Geeves M.A. Probing nucleotide dissociation from myosin in vitro using microgram quantities of myosin.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2003; 24 (14620745): 315-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A single laser flash released 15–20 μm ATP from cATP (100 μm) and the fluorescence change resulting from cmADP release was recorded (Fig. 3). The fluorescence signal could be fitted to a single exponential, which gives the ADP-release rate (k-D). The small increase in fluorescence at the start of the transient is an artifact resulting from the laser flash which is difficult to eliminate entirely when working with low fluorescence signals as used here. Note the direction of the change is the same in both transients. The two exon 3 chimeras, IFI-3a and EMB-3b, show an almost complete reversal of their k-D values compared with their WT counterparts (Table 1). Insertion of the embryonic exon 3a area into IFI results in an ADP release rate typically found in WT EMB (k-D = 2.1 ± 0.41 s−1), whereas the introduction of the fast IFI exon 3b region into EMB increases the ADP release rate of EMB-3b to WT IFI levels (k-D = 7.0 ± 1.3 s−1). Reversal of k-D rates after exon exchange was previously found for one of the other variable domains, the relay loop encoded by exon 9, as introduction of the exon 9a domain into IFI reduced the ADP release rate to embryonic levels, whereas the substitution of the exon 9b region into EMB increased the ADP release rate to IFI-levels (10Bloemink M.J.

The directionality of the observed fluorescence traces is variable and can even be reversed as seen here for EMB-3b. The fluorescence trace of IFI-3a shows a signal decrease after release of cmADP, similar to what was seen previously for IFI and EMB (5Miller B.M. Nyitrai M. Bernstein S.I. Geeves M.A. Kinetic analysis of Drosophila muscle myosin isoforms suggests a novel mode of mechanochemical coupling.J. Biol.

However, EMB-3b fluorescence increases upon cmADP release and this reversal of the fluorescence signal has been observed in other studies. We previously reported a similar reversal of fluorescence change for a series of probes and myosin isoforms (12Clark R.J. Nyitrai M. Webb M.R.

We currently have no explanation of why this occurs, except that this must reflect a change in the environment of the fluorescent probe that will require analysis of a high-resolution structure to resolve. Basal and actin-activated ATPase activity of WT IFI S1 and the two exon 3 mutants were measured (see Fig. 4 and Table 2). IFI-3a S1 showed a significant reduction in basal Ca-ATPase (4.92 ± 1.05 s−1) compared with WT IFI S1 (9.79 ± 1.39 s−1), whereas Ca-ATPase activity of EMB-3b S1 (5.16 ± 2.01 s−1) is significantly increased compared with values for WT EMB (1.83 ± 0.08 s−1) (Fig. 4A and Table 2). The same trends were seen for basal Mg-ATPase activity, as well as actin-activated ATPase values (Vmax), although differences did not reach statistical significance (Table 2 and Fig. 4, B and C). Although previous Ca-ATPase, Mg-ATPase and Vmax measurements for full-length myosin (7Swank D.M. Knowles A.F. Kronert W.A. Suggs J.A. Morrill G.E. Nikkhoy M. Manipon G.G. Bernstein S.I.

Open table in a new tab Using flash photolysis, the turnover number (kcat) was measured at a fixed actin concentration for S1 of both exon 3 exchange mutants and compared with IFI WT (Fig. 4D). The time taken to hydrolyze all released ATP (tcat) was estimated from the time at which the dissociation reaction was 50% complete (tdiss) to the time for 50% recovery of light scattering (tass). This time period (tcat) is linearly dependent upon the amount of released ATP (see Fig. 4D). The steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis is the inverse of the slope (steady-state rate = [ATP]/tcat), allowing the catalytic activity (kcat) to be determined. For IFI a steady-state rate of 0.104 (μM s−1) was found, resulting in a kcat of 0.18 s−1. This value is essentially the same as the kcat value reported previously for IFI S1 using the same experimental setup (kcat = 0.17 ± 0.006 s−1) (10Bloemink M.J. Dambacher C.M. Knowles A.F. Melkani G.C. Geeves M.A. Bernstein S.I. Alternative exon 9-encoded relay domains affect more than one communication pathway in the Drosophila myosin head.J. Mol.

The catalytic activity of EMB-3b (kcat = 0.021 ± 0.009s−1) is nearly identical to the value measured previously for EMB (0.028 s−1), whereas the kcat value for IFI-3a (0.057 ± 0.003 s−1) shows a decrease compared with IFI (10Bloemink M.J. Dambacher C.M. Knowles A.F. Melkani G.C. Geeves M.A. Bernstein S.I. Alternative exon 9-encoded relay domains affect more than one communication pathway in the Drosophila myosin head.J. Mol.

Previously reported Vmax values for full-length myosin constructs showed similar behavior (7Swank D.M. Knowles A.F. Kronert W.A. Suggs J.A. Morrill G.E. Nikkhoy M. Manipon G.G. Bernstein S.I. Variable N-terminal regions of muscle myosin heavy chain modulate ATPase rate and actin sliding velocity.J. Biol.

Sequence alignment of various myosin isoforms show that the exon 3 area is highly variable, with only five residues that are fully conserved: Asp90, Asn105, Arg109, Ile115, and Tyr116 (Fig. S1). The recently published crystal structure of embryonic Drosophila myosin in the rigor-like conformation (PDB ID: 5W1A) shows that the exon 3 region (residues 69–116) starts with two β-strands (β4: 69–73 and β5: 77–79), which form part of the SH3-like domain found in many other myosins (Fig. 5A). The β4 and β5 strands are followed by two short helices (HA: 83–85 and HB: 91–93) and a longer helix C (residues 98–111). The C-terminal residues of the exon 3 area are at the start of the next β-strand (S1B) (Fig. 5B) which forms the first β-strand of the central seven-stranded β-sheet in the myosin head. Conserved residue Asp90 is located between exon 3 helix A and helix B, residues Asn105 and Arg109 are located on the same side of helix C, and Ile115 and Tyr116 are part of the first β-strand of the central 7-stranded β-sheet, a conserved feature of all myosins. The EMB crystal structure shows that Asp90 forms a strong salt-bridge with Arg148 and that the latter also forms a hydrogen bond with Gly120, located between the first two β-strands of the central 7-stranded β-sheet (Fig. 5B). Conserved residue Asn105 forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen of three residues close to Asp90 (Lys87, Ile/Ala88, and Met91), whereas conserved residue Arg109 contacts Tyr116. The available crystal structure of embryonic Drosophila myosin in the rigor-like conformation (PDB ID: 5W1A) was used as a template to generate a homology model for IFI myosin. Overlay of the IFI model and the EMB crystal structure showed that the backbone topology for both is very similar (root mean square deviation of 1.59 Å). Inspecting the homology models using scallop myosin templates that represent conformations at different steps of the mechanochemical cycle shows that some of these conserved interactions are maintained throughout the cycle, whereas others are lost (see “Discussion” for details). The kinetic data show that exchange of the exon 3 area alters the nucleotide binding properties of Drosophila myosins. A large body of research has established that nucleotide binding and processing in the active site of myosin involves four highly conserved loops: P-loop (GESGAGKT), switch 1 (AKTXXN(N D)NSSR), switch 2 (DIXGFE), and the purine binding loop (NPXXXXXXY) (14Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. The way things move: Looking under the hood of molecular motor proteins.Science. 2000; 288 (10753125): 88-9510.1126/science.288.5463.88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). The exon 3 region (residues 69–116) could potentially alter nucleotide binding properties by interacting with any of these highly conserved loops. Inspection of the EMB crystal structure (Fig. 6A) shows that the purine binding loop (residues 127–135) interacts with the exon 3 region; for example, exon 3 residue Tyr110 forms a hydrogen bond with purine binding loop residue Asn127 (Fig. 6B). Asn127 also has a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of P-loop residue Gly182. These contacts suggest a role for the exon 3 region of the myosin head in regulating nucleotide binding and release via interaction with the purine binding loop. Homology models derived from scallop myosin structures at various states of the crossbridge cycle were generated for both IFI and EMB and used for further analysis, because the EMB crystal structure is only available for a rigor-like configuration that has no nucleotide bound. The homology models confirm the interaction between the purine binding loop and the exon 3 area and suggest this interaction depends on the myosin state involved (see Fig. S2 for a detailed description of these interactions for different myosin conformations). However, the interactions between the purine binding loop and the exon 3 area are very similar for IFI and EMB (see Figs. S2 and S3 for details). The EMB crystal structure shows that the exon 3 region has no direct contacts with any of the other variable domains in the myosin head. However, the SH1-SH2 helix is wedged between the exon 3 and exon 9 (relay loop) regions and makes contac"
https://openalex.org/W3080805195,"The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway is the primary means by which the heart regulates moment-to-moment changes in contractility and metabolism. We have previously found that PKA signaling is dysfunctional in the diabetic heart, yet the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to determine if decreased insulin signaling contributes to a dysfunctional PKA response. To do so, we isolated adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) from wild type and Akita type 1 diabetic mice. ACMs were cultured in the presence or absence of insulin and PKA signaling was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody that recognizes proteins specifically phosphorylated by PKA. We found significant decreases in proteins phosphorylated by PKA in wild type ACMs cultured in the absence of insulin. PKA substrate phosphorylation was decreased in Akita ACMs, as compared to wild type, and unresponsive to the effects of insulin. The decrease in PKA signaling was observed regardless of whether the kinase was stimulated with a beta-agonist, a cell-permeable cAMP analog, or with phosphodiesterase inhibitors. PKA content was unaffected, suggesting that the decrease in PKA signaling may be occurring by the loss of specific PKA substrates. Phospho-specific antibodies were used to discern which potential substrates may be sensitive to the loss of insulin. Contractile proteins were phosphorylated similarly in wild type and Akita ACMs regardless of insulin. However, phosphorylation of the glycolytic regulator, PFK-2, was significantly decreased in an insulin-dependent manner in wild type ACMs and in an insulin-independent manner in Akita ACMs. These results demonstrate a defect in PKA activation in the diabetic heart, mediated in part by deficient insulin signaling, that results in an abnormal activation of a primary metabolic regulator."
https://openalex.org/W3069352910,"We investigated the effect of chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) on glucose metabolism and its underlying mechanisms in skeletal muscle cells, and evaluated whether the observed effects are relevant in humans. CHI3L1 was associated with increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscles in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner, and with increased intracellular calcium levels via PAR2. The improvement in glucose metabolism observed in an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test on male C57BL/6J mice supported this association. Inhibition of the CaMKK was associated with suppression of CHI3L1-mediated glucose uptake. Additionally, CHI3L1 was found to influence glucose uptake through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Results suggested that CHI3L1 stimulated the phosphorylation of AS160 and p38 MAPK downstream of AMPK and AKT, and the resultant GLUT4 translocation. In primary myoblast cells, stimulation of AMPK and AKT was observed in response to CHI3L1, underscoring the biological relevance of CHI3L1. CHI3L1 levels were elevated in cells under conditions that mimic exercise in vitro and in exercised mice in vivo, indicating that CHI3L1 is secreted during muscle contraction. Finally, similar associations between CHI3L1 and metabolic parameters were observed in humans alongside genotype associations between CHI3L1 and diabetes at the population level. CHI3L1 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3081189816,"Suchana—a large-scale, 7-year nutrition program that started in 2015—is being implemented in 250,000 households in the marginalized segment in north-east Bangladesh, with the aim of improving childhood nutrition status. Untreated childhood moderate wasting may develop to severe wasting, which is associated with a 10-fold higher risk of mortality compared to children of normal weight relative to height/length. Identifying the diverse, age-specific risk factors for moderate wasting may help such programs to formulate tailored interventions to prevent and treat childhood malnutrition in rural communities. The objective of this study was to identify the age-specific factors associated with moderate wasting among 6‒23-month-old children in beneficiary households. Cross-sectional data on 4,400 children was collected through systematic sampling between November 2016 and February 2017 using the Suchana beneficiary list. In total, 8.1% of 6‒11 month-olds and 10.3% of 12‒23 month-olds suffered moderate wasting; 12‒23-month-olds had a 1.3-fold higher risk of moderate wasting than 6‒11-month-olds. Our results of logistic regression models suggest that larger household size, higher maternal body mass index (BMI), and maternal food consumption status more than usual during the recent pregnancy were associated with a reduced risk of moderate wasting among 6‒11-month-olds. Higher maternal BMI, normal maternal food consumption status during last pregnancy, being female and maternal knowledge on diarrheal management, were associated with a reduced risk of moderate wasting among 12‒23-month-olds. In conclusion, beyond maternal BMI and maternal food consumption status during the last pregnancy, the factors associated with moderate wasting among 6‒23-month-olds in the poorest households in Bangladesh are age-specific."
https://openalex.org/W3081427687,"Background Mental health supported housing services are a key component in the rehabilitation of people with severe and complex needs. They are implemented widely in the UK and other deinstitutionalised countries but there have been few empirical studies of their effectiveness due to the logistic challenges and costs of standard research methods. The Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) tool, developed to de-identify and interrogate routinely recorded electronic health records, may provide an alternative to evaluate supported housing services. Methods The feasibility of using the Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust CRIS database to identify a sample of users of mental health supported accommodation services. Two approaches to data interrogation and case identification were compared; using structured fields indicating individual’s accommodation status, and iterative development of free text searches of clinical notes referencing supported housing. The data used were recorded over a 10-year-period (01-January-2008 to 31-December-2017). Results Both approaches were carried out by one full-time researcher over four weeks (150 hours). Two structured fields indicating accommodation status were found, 2,140 individuals had a value in at least one of the fields representative of supported accommodation. The free text search of clinical notes returned 21,103 records pertaining to 1,105 individuals. A manual review of 10% of the notes indicated an estimated 733 of these individuals had used a supported housing service, a positive predictive value of 66.4%. Over two-thirds of the individuals returned in the free text search (768/1,105, 69.5%) were identified via the structured fields approach. Although the estimated positive predictive value was relatively high, a substantial proportion of the individuals appearing only in the free text search (337/1,105, 30.5%) are likely to be false positives. Conclusions It is feasible and requires minimal resources to use de-identified electronic health record search tools to identify large samples of users of mental health supported housing using structured and free text fields. Further work is needed to establish the availability and completion of variables relevant to specific clinical research questions in order to fully assess the utility of electronic health records in evaluating the effectiveness of these services."
