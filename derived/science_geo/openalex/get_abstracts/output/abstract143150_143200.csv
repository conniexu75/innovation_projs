https://openalex.org/W2141809016,"Activation of transforming growth factor β receptors causes the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad proteins, which then participate in the regulation of expression of target genes. We describe a novel Smad-interacting protein, SIP1, which was identified using the yeast two-hybrid system. Although SIP1 interacts with the MH2 domain of receptor-regulated Smads in yeast andin vitro, its interaction with full-length Smads in mammalian cells requires receptor-mediated Smad activation. SIP1 is a new member of the δEF1/Zfh-1 family of two-handed zinc finger/homeodomain proteins. Like δEF1, SIP1 binds to 5′-CACCT sequences in different promoters, including the Xenopus brachyury promoter. Overexpression of either full-length SIP1 or its C-terminal zinc finger cluster, which bind to the Xbra2promoter in vitro, prevented expression of the endogenousXbra gene in early Xenopus embryos. Therefore, SIP1, like δEF1, is likely to be a transcriptional repressor, which may be involved in the regulation of at least one immediate response gene for activin-dependent signal transduction pathways. The identification of this Smad-interacting protein opens new routes to investigate the mechanisms by which transforming growth factor β members exert their effects on expression of target genes in responsive cells and in the vertebrate embryo.

Smads were initially identified by means of genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans as Mad and Sma gene products, respectively. Nine different vertebrate Smads have been isolated (reviewed in Refs. 1Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 2Kretzschmar M.

These proteins are characterized by a three-domain structure containing conserved N-terminal and C-terminal domains, called the MH1 and MH2 domains, which flank a more variable, proline-rich linker region. The Smads can be classified into three subgroups based on their distinct functions. The receptor-regulated Smads (Smad1, 2, 3, 5, and 8) contain a conserved SSXS motif at their extreme C-terminal end. Upon ligand stimulation, two serines in this motif are directly phosphorylated by specific type I receptors. Once activated, these Smads associate with Smad4, a common mediator Smad, and the heteromeric complexes translocate to the nucleus where they mediate responses to specific ligands. Smads 1, 5, and 8 act in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways, whereas Smads 2 and 3 act in activin and TGF-β pathways. A third group of Smads, the inhibitory Smads (Smad6 and Smad7), prevent the activation of receptor-regulated Smads or their heteromerization with Smad4. Functional homologues of inhibitory Smads and the common mediator Smad in Drosophilahave been identified as Dad and Medea, respectively (1Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 2Kretzschmar M. Massagué J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 3Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar).In the absence of signaling, Smads are kept in a latent conformation through an intramolecular interaction between the MH1 and MH2 domains. Activation of receptor-regulated Smads has been proposed to disrupt this autoinhibition, allowing the MH1 and MH2 domains to exert distinct functions in the nucleus (1Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 2Kretzschmar M. Massagué J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Smad4 and the MH1 domain of activated Smad3 can directly bind DNA. Smad-binding elements in the promoters of different immediate response genes such as JunB and PAI-I contain 5′-CAGA boxes, and multimerization of such elements creates a TGF-β -inducible enhancer (5Yingling J.

The crystal structure of the Smad3 MH1domain bound to a Smad-binding element revealed that 5′-GTCT represents the minimal DNA-binding sequence (9Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). However, promoter studies on other direct target genes, such as vestigial andtinman in Drosophila and goosecoid in the mouse, have implicated GC-rich sequences as direct DNA targets forMad and/or Medea and for Smad3 and/or Smad4 (10Kim J.

Together, these data suggest that Smads display a low DNA-binding affinity and specificity but are able to achieve highly specific regulation of target promoters through physical or functional interaction with nearby bound transcription factors (12Labbé E.

Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This has been exemplified through detailed studies of activin/TGF-β response elements (ARE) in the promoters of Xenopus Mix.2 and mousegoosecoid which bind the forkhead transcription factors FAST1 and FAST2, respectively (12Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 13Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M.

Lengauer C. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that upon ligand stimulation, FAST1 or FAST2 recruit heteromeric Smad2/4 complexes to the Mix.2 or goosecoid promoters through their interaction with the MH2 domain of activated Smad2. This promotes binding of Smad4 to an adjacent site, resulting in enhanced transcriptional activation (12Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 16Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).The MH2 domain of Smads appear to mediate the association with transcription factors and although the majority of documented interactions involve the induction of gene expression, some block transcriptional responses to ligand stimulation. For example, the transcription factor and oncoprotein Evi-1 specifically interacts with activated Smad3, thereby preventing Smad3 from binding DNA and blocking TGF-β-induced growth arrest in certain cell types (20Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Recruitment of Smad3/Smad4 heteromeric complexes to the mouse goosecoidpromoter blocks, rather than induces, transcription of the gene (12Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Overall, these data indicate that, once activated and targeted to the nucleus, Smads are able to undergo multiple interactions with DNA and/or with different transcription factors to cause both activation and repression of gene expression.Previously, we have shown that overexpression of the XenopusSmad1 MH2 domain induces ventral cell types in Xenopusembryos. Because this domain does not have DNA-binding capacity, we anticipated that it would interact with transcription factors in the nucleus to elicit its biological effect (21Meersseman G. Verschueren K. Nelles L. Blumenstock C. Kraft H. Wuytens G. Remacle J. Kozak C.A. Tylzanowski P. Niehrs C. Huylebroeck D. Mech. Dev. 1997; 61: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, a search for Smad-interacting proteins (SIPs) was initiated using two-hybrid screening in yeast. As bait, the XSmad1 MH2 domain was fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (GAL4DBD). As source of preys, we used a 12.5-dpc mouse embryo cDNA library fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain (GAL4TAD). This screen yielded several SIPs, one of which, SIP1, is characterized here.DISCUSSIONWe describe here the isolation of SIP1, a Smad-interacting protein that is a new member of the family of two-handed zinc finger/homeodomain transcription factors. SIP1 was isolated as a mouse cDNA encoding a protein that interacted with the MH2 domain ofXSmad1 in yeast. It was subsequently shown to bind in mammalian cells to activated, but not latent, full-length receptor-regulated Smads, and not to bind to the common mediator Smad4. These findings identify SIP1 as a potential new component of signal transduction pathways triggered by members of the TGF-β superfamily and add SIP1 to the list of transcription factors able to physically interact with Smads, including FAST1 and FAST2, Evi-1, c-Jun, and c-Fos (14Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 15Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 17Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 20Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These factors have been identified as mediators/ modulators of signaling because they either bound to ligand-responsive elements in promoters of immediate target genes (12Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar,13Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 17Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) or, as is the case for Evi-1, could counteract the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β (20Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).SIP1 is the first novel Smad-interacting protein identified by a two-hybrid screening in yeast. Our observation that the isolated MH2 domain of Smads could bind to SIP1 in the absence of signaling, but that full-length Smads needed to be activated to interact, supports the view that the Smad MH1 domain exerts an inhibitory effect on the MH2 domain. These auto-inhibitory interactions are known to be disrupted upon phosphorylation (1Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 2Kretzschmar M. Massagué J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 3Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), thus allowing the MH2 domain to associate with transcription factors. Interestingly, we were unable to detect binding of SIP1 to full-length XSmad1 in yeast. Our data indicate that, in yeast, full-length Smads are also in a latent conformation, preventing the MH2 domain from interacting with certain proteins. Whether unfolding of receptor-regulated Smads and their nuclear translocation is sufficient to drive association with SIP1 in mammalian cells, or whether high affinity interaction of SIP1 with these Smads also depends on the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal serines remains to be determined. In this context, it is important to mention that these serines map in a region shown to be critical for binding of the XSmad1 MH2 domain to SIP1. This region encompasses the last 43 amino acids of XSmad1, and their deletion abolishes the interaction. In contrast, substitution of the conserved Gly-418 localized in a loop required for association of Smads with activated type I receptors (55Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) does not significantly affect interaction of the XSmad1 MH2 domain with SIP1. Thus, interactions of the XSmad1 MH2 domain with type I receptors and SIP1 occur through distinct sequences.We have also mapped a 51-amino acids-long Smad-binding domain in SIP1 that is essential for its association with Smads. The SIP1 zinc finger clusters are dispensable for binding to Smads, in contrast to the C-terminal zinc finger cluster of Evi-1, which is necessary for interaction with Smad3 (20Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is no sequence similarity between the SBD and the Smad-binding domain of FAST1 (SID; Ref. 14Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Smads therefore appear to be able to bind to a wide range of amino acid sequences.We have demonstrated that SIP1 can interact with different, receptor-activated Smads in mammalian cells. However, in our experiments, SIP1 bound more strongly to Smad3 than to Smad2, both of which were activated by constitutively active ALK-4 (or ActR-IB), an activin type I receptor. This suggests that the affinity of SIP1 for these Smads differ in vivo. In addition, this aspect may contribute to functional differences between Smad2 and Smad3, as observed before in HaCat keratinocyte cells (56Shimizu A. Kato M. Nakao A. Imamura T. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Kawabata M. Shimada S. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Alternatively, activation and nuclear translocation may occur more efficiently for Smad3-containing Smad complexes in HEK293T cells. It has been demonstrated previously that Smad6 can inhibit receptor-regulated phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad2, but not Smad3 (57Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Thus, differential activation of Smad2 and Smad3 could be regulated by the inhibitory Smad6 in these cells. Nuclear accumulation of Smads is also modulated by cross-talk between different signaling pathways. For example, phosphorylation of the proline-rich linker region in Smad1 by the Erk family of mitogen-activated protein kinases prevents nuclear accumulation of Smad1/4 heteromeric complexes (58Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). In general, which Smads are targeted to the nucleus, and consequently interact with binding proteins such as SIP1, may indeed largely depend on cellular context.SIP1 displays sequence similarities with vertebrate δEF1 andDrosophila Zfh-1, which are both involved in the control of cell type specification during embryonic development (37Lai Z. Rushton E. Bate M. Rubin G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4122-4126Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 38Higashi Y. Moribe H. Takagi T. Sekido R. Kawakami K. Kikutani H. Kondoh H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1467-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 39Takagi T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Development. 1998; 125: 21-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). δEF1 was originally identified as a chicken δ1-crystallin enhancer binding protein. Likely homologues of chicken δEF1 have also been cloned from other species. These include mouse δEF1 or MEB1, human AREB6, ZEB, or Nil-2a, hamster BZP and rat Zfhep (Ref. 46Stamenkovic I. Clark E.A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, and reviewed in Ref. 59Genetta T. Kadesch T. Gene. 1996; 169: 289-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). δEF1 has been characterized as a repressor of E2 box-mediated gene activation. It binds to 5′-CACCT sequences, and in doing so it can repress transcription by two mechanisms. Either it blocks activity of transcription factors such as c-Myb and Ets bound at nearby sites in target promoters (60Postigo A.A. Sheppard A.M. Mucenski M.L. Dean D.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3924-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or it competes for common binding sites (E2 boxes) with a subset of bHLH activators, such as E2A and MyoD. This competition has been proposed to provide a genetic switch in which the activity of Ig and muscle-specific enhancers is dictated by the relative levels of δEF1 and these bHLH activators in the nucleus (45Sekido R. Takagi T. Okanami M. Moribe H. Yamamura M. Higashi Y. Kondoh H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,51Genetta T. Ruezinsky D. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6153-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).Analysis of the DNA-binding activities of SIP1, as presented here and currently being analyzed in a separate study involving dissection of DNA target sites and structure-function analysis of the zinc finger clusters, has shown that SIP1, like δEF1, binds to 5′-CACCT sequences. Interestingly, it has been proposed, based on the phenotypes of δEF1 knock-out mice, that another transcription factor with a similar DNA-binding specificity as that of δEF1 exists (39Takagi T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Development. 1998; 125: 21-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, despite the characterization of δEF1 as a negative regulator of muscle differentiation in vitro and its abundant expression in somites, these mice do not display any detectable phenotype in developing muscle (39Takagi T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Development. 1998; 125: 21-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps SIP1, with its overlapping DNA-binding specificities and partially overlapping expression pattern (data not shown), compensates for the loss of δEF1 in certain tissues of the knock-out mice.We have identified 5′-CACCT sequences in the promoter of X. brachyury (Xbra2), an immediate response gene for mesoderm inducing factors such as activin. These sequences can bind SIP1CZF or full-length SIP1 in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of the SIP1 CZF domain or of full-length SIP1 protein inXenopus embryos abolished expression of Xbra in presumptive mesoderm. These data indicate that SIP1, when overexpressed, can act as a transcriptional repressor ofXbra in vivo. Interestingly, the SIP1-binding sites in the Xbra2 promoter, the regulation of which is very complex in the amphibian embryo, map to a region that is required for transcriptional induction of the gene by activin (53Latinkic B.V. Umbhauer M. Neal K. Lerchner W. Smith J.C. Cunliffe V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3265-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Results from a recent study using transgenic Xenopus embryos have shown that these SIP1-binding sites are required for the correct spatial and temporal expression patterns of Xbra2 reporter constructs. 4W. Lerchner, B. V. Latinkic, L. Fairclough, J. E. Remacle, D. Huylebroeck, and J. C. Smith, unpublished results. Thus, if endogenous SIP1-like proteins are present in theXenopus embryo, they may participate together with co-repressors (as shown for δEF1, Ref. 61Ikeda K. Halle J.-P. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in the regulation ofXbra2 expression during early development. Overall, our results suggest that transcriptional induction of Xbrain response to mesoderm inducing factors such as activin could (at least in part) occur through interaction of activated Smads with a SIP1-like protein, thereby preventing the latter from binding to the Xbra2 promoter and inhibiting its expression. Activation might therefore be viewed more as relief of repression. Both the Smad-SIP1 and SIP1-DNA interaction are, however, very difficult to analyze biochemically in the amphibian embryo, and cell-based systems in which the Xbra2 promoter can be functionally tested are not available. Further experiments, including the isolation of aXenopus SIP1 homologue, analysis of its expression pattern, and identification of direct target promoters which can be analyzed in cell lines, will help to unravel further the relevance of SIP1/Smad interactions in signal transduction pathways triggered by members of the TGF-β superfamily.

Smads were initially identified by means of genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans as Mad and Sma gene products, respectively. Nine different vertebrate Smads have been isolated (reviewed in Refs. 1Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 2Kretzschmar M.

These proteins are characterized by a three-domain structure containing conserved N-terminal and C-terminal domains, called the MH1 and MH2 domains, which flank a more variable, proline-rich linker region. The Smads can be classified into three subgroups based on their distinct functions. The receptor-regulated Smads (Smad1, 2, 3, 5, and 8) contain a conserved SSXS motif at their extreme C-terminal end. Upon ligand stimulation, two serines in this motif are directly phosphorylated by specific type I receptors. Once activated, these Smads associate with Smad4, a common mediator Smad, and the heteromeric complexes translocate to the nucleus where they mediate responses to specific ligands. Smads 1, 5, and 8 act in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways, whereas Smads 2 and 3 act in activin and TGF-β pathways. A third group of Smads, the inhibitory Smads (Smad6 and Smad7), prevent the activation of receptor-regulated Smads or their heteromerization with Smad4. Functional homologues of inhibitory Smads and the common mediator Smad in Drosophilahave been identified as Dad and Medea, respectively (1Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Smad4 and the MH1 domain of activated Smad3 can directly bind DNA.

We have recently shown that Bcl2 phosphorylation is a dynamic process that involves the protein kinase C α and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Ruvolo, P. P., Deng, X., Carr, B. K., and May, W. S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 25436–25442; and Deng, X., Ito, T., Carr, B. K., Mumby, M. C., and May, W. S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 34157–34163). The potent apoptotic agent ceramide can activate a PP2A, suggesting that one potential component of the ceramide-induced death signal may involve the inactivation of Bcl2. Results indicate that C2-ceramide but not inactive C2-dihydroceramide, was found to specifically activate a mitochondrial PP2A, which rapidly and completely induced Bcl2 dephosphorylation and correlated closely with ceramide-induced cell death. Using a genetic approach, the gain-of-function S70E Bcl2 mutation, which mimics phosphorylation, fails to undergo apoptosis even with the addition of high doses of ceramide (IC50 > 50 μm). In contrast, cells overexpressing exogenous wild-type Bcl2 were sensitive to ceramide at dosages where PP2A is fully active and Bcl2 would be expected to be dephosphorylated (IC50 = 14 μm). These findings indicate that in cells expressing functional Bcl2, the mechanism of death action for ceramide may involve, at least in part, a mitochondrial PP2A that dephosphorylates and inactivates Bcl2.

Whereas DAG stimulates cell proliferation and promotes cell survival in many cells, ceramide arrests cell growth and induces programmed cell death (1Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

This phenomena almost suggests that the production of ceramide in response to apoptotic stress stimuli may be an universal element of apoptosis (4Smyth M.L. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 41: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with water-soluble analogs of ceramide such as C2-ceramide can induce apoptosis, whereas biologically inactive ceramide analogs (e.g. C2-dihydroceramide) have no effect on cell viability (13Obeid L.M.

Furthermore, recent studies have shown that introduction of bacterial sphingomyelinase in human leukemic cells, to generate intracellular ceramide, results in the induction of apoptosis (20Zhang P.

Studies were designed to test the effect of ceramide on Bcl2 phosphorylation and its abilities to suppress apoptosis and to identify a potential mechanism(s) for ceramide-induced Bcl2 dephosphorylation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIt is well established that treatment of HL60 cells with C2-ceramide but not the inactive C2-dihydroceramide analog induces cells to undergo apoptosis (13Obeid L.M. Lindardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). HL60 cells were treated with varying doses of C2-ceramide and C2-dihydroceramide for 24 h to assess cell viability (Fig. 1 A). Consistent with recent findings (13Obeid L.M. Lindardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar, 19Jarvis W.D. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Martin H.A. Kramer L.B. Erukulla R.K. Bittman R. Grant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8275-8284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the inactive C2-dihydroceramide analog had no effect on HL60 cell survival, but cells were killed by C2-ceramide (i.e. IC50 = 5.3 μm; Fig. 1 A). The mechanism of cell death was determined to be apoptosis by detection of apoptotic cell populations that display a sub-2N genomic content during FACS sorting (data not shown; 23).We recently discovered that Bcl2 phosphorylation at serine 70 is required for the full and potent suppression of apoptosis (21May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is mediated, at least in part, by mitochondrial PKC α (23Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). HL60 cells express abundant levels of mitochondrial PKC α and have robust basal levels of phosphorylated Bcl2 (23Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of ceramide on Bcl2 phosphorylation, HL60 cells were treated with varying doses of C2-ceramide during metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate, and the phosphorylation status of Bcl2 was examined following immunoprecipitation. Western analysis demonstrates that roughly equivalent levels of Bcl2 protein were immunoprecipitated from control and C2-ceramide-treated samples. However, even though Bcl2 is highly phosphorylated in HL60 cells, its phosphorylation status is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner when the cells are treated with increasing doses of C2-ceramide (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, ceramide-induced Bcl2 dephosphorylation closely correlates with reduced survival. For example, 1 μm C2-ceramide has little effect on either HL60 cell survival or Bcl2 phosphorylation, whereas increasing doses of C2-ceramide promote Bcl2 dephosphorylation and result in decreased survival (Fig. 1, A and B). By contrast, the addition of the inactive C2-dihydroceramide, even at a high concentration (50 μm), has no such effect on either Bcl2 phosphorylation or survival (Fig. 1, A andB). These findings suggest that Bcl2 phosphorylation can be inhibited by active ceramide in a mechanism that may involve a Bcl2 phosphatase. Interestingly, ceramide-induced dephosphorylation of Bcl2 can be blocked by the potent phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (Fig.1 C), suggesting a mechanism involving an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase such as PP2A or PP1. In addition, cells pretreated with okadaic acid are more resistant to ceramide-induced cell death even when high concentrations (50 μm) of C2-ceramide are used (Fig. 1 D). These findings suggest, at least in HL60 cells, that there is a close association between ceramide-induced apoptosis and Bcl2 dephosphorylation mediated by an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase. Because PP2A but not PP1 is a Bcl2 phosphatase (24Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and ceramide has been reported to activate a cytosolic PP2A (5Dobrowsky R.T. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5048-5051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dobrowsky R.T. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12808-12813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), a potential mechanistic link exists. To test this possibility, the effect of ceramide treatment on PP2A activity in HL60 cells was assessed. Cells were treated with varying doses of C2-ceramide for 3 h and lyzed in a low detergent lysate buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). The phosphatase activity in protein lysates was determined by measuring the generation of free phosphate liberated from a phosphopeptide substrate, RRA(pT)VA, which can be specifically recognized by PP2A, PP2B, or PP2C depending on the phosphatase buffer conditions used (26Donella Deana A. MacGowan C.H. Cohen P. Marchiori F. Meyer H.E. Pina L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1051: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Unlike PP2B or PP2C, PP2A activity does not require any cations and can be specifically assessed when both Ca2+ and Mg2+ are eliminated from the buffer (27Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, results indicate that C2-ceramide stimulates phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). Importantly, low doses of C2-ceramide (1 μm) only minimally stimulate (∼1.4-fold) activity, whereas higher concentrations of C2-ceramide (>10 μm) potently increase activity (∼ 2.5-fold; Fig.2 A). The phosphatase activity observed is likely the result of PP2A or a PP2A-like phosphatase, because inclusion of 10 nm okadaic acid directly in the assay buffer results in >90% inhibition of the phosphatase activity (data not shown).Figure 2C2-ceramide activates a mitochondrial PP2A in HL60 cells. A and B, cells were grown in the absence or presence of 10 μm C2-ceramide for 3 h and, where appropriate, 100 nm okadaic acid (OA) was added to cells 1 h prior to C2-ceramide addition. Total cellular protein (A) or protein from isolated mitochondria (B) was used in an in vitro phosphatase assay, and free PO4 was measured by optical density at 590 nm as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A standard curve with free phosphate was used to determine the amount of free phosphate generated. Phosphatase activity was defined as pmol of free PO4 generated/μg protein/min. Data are presented as percentage of phosphatase activity of control, which was 25.6 ± 1.8 pmol/μg/min for total lysate control (A) and 2.4 ± 0.3 pmol/μg/min for mitochondrial control (B).Error bars represent S.E. ± 5% based on three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Although this possibility is intriguing, it cannot be ruled out that stimulation of PP2A phosphatase activity merely reflects the activation of cytosolic CAPP, which may not directly affect phosphorylation of mitochondrial Bcl2. If ceramide is indeed affecting a Bcl2 phosphatase, it is expected that activation will occur at the mitochondrial membrane level. To test this possibility, the effect of C2-ceramide on PP2A activity in mitochondrial membranes from HL60 cells was determined. Following treatment with 10 μm C2-ceramide for 3 h, mitochondrial membranes were isolated as described previously (23Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 24Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Results indicate that C2-ceramide stimulates a greater than 5-fold increase in PP2A activity, whereas cells treated with the inactive C2-dihydrocermide analog demonstrate no stimulation of mitochondrial PP2A (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, Fig. 2 B shows that pretreatment of cells with 100 nm okadaic acid can totally prevent stimulation of phosphatase activity by C2-ceramide. Therefore, we conclude that C2-ceramide-induced Bcl2 dephosphorylation may result from the activation of a mitochondrial PP2A.The question then remains whether Bcl2 dephosphorylation is required for ceramide-induced apoptosis in cells expressing Bcl2. It has recently been reported that interleukin-3-dependent murine myeloid cells that overexpress exogenous wild-type (WT) Bcl2 are protected from rapid apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal or chemotherapeutic drugs (21May W.S.

Furthermore, the nonphosphorylatable, loss-of-function serine 70 to alanine (S70A) mutant Bcl2 fails, however, to fully suppress apoptosis (22Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). By contrast, a serine 70 to glutamate (S70E) Bcl2 mutant, which may mimic a phosphorylation charge, is able to efficiently suppress apoptosis, indicating a gain-of-function mutation (22Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of increasing concentrations of ceramide on the Bcl2 mutants was tested. The data presented are representative of at least three clones tested for each transfectant that was previously shown to be phenotypically similar (22Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Each transfectant demonstrates a 6–8-fold increase above the endogenous level of Bcl2 (22Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The S70E Bcl2 and S70 A Bcl2 transfectants express roughly equivalent levels of Bcl2 protein, whereas the WT Bcl2 transfectant expresses roughly 30% more protein than the other transfectants as determined by densitometry (Fig.3 A). This finding suggests that any observed effects are unlikely because of differences in Bcl2 expression. Results indicate that the S70A Bcl2 mutant fails to protect cells from C2-ceramide induced apoptosis, whereas cells expressing exogenous WT Bcl2 are protected from low (i.e. < 10 μm) but not high concentrations of C2-ceramide, which potently activates PP2A (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, after 48 h in the presence of ceramide, cells expressing WT Bcl2 become sensitive to C2-ceramide, whereas the S70E Bcl2 mutant remains potently able to protect cells from apoptosis (Fig.3, B and C). These data strongly support a mechanism by which serine 70 phosphorylation of Bcl2 is required to prevent ceramide-induced cell death in interleukin-3-dependent myeloid cells. Whereas increasing concentrations of ceramide can increase both PP2A activation and Bcl2 dephosphorylation, the S70E Bcl2 mutant would be expected to be insensitive to PP2A, and thus the cells would remain resistant to ceramide-induced apoptosis.Figure 3The gain-of-function S70E Bcl2 mutant is resistant to ceramide-induced apoptosis. A, Bcl2 protein expression was determined in murine cells transfected with WT, S70A, or S70E Bcl2 by Western analysis using Bcl2 antisera (22Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Protein levels were normalized to actin. B and C, survival was assessed in WT, S70A, or S70E Bcl2 transfectants after treatment with varying concentrations of C2-ceramide for 24 (B) or 48 h (C). Each transfectant used here is a representative of three clones that are phenotypically similar and have been previously described in Ref. 22Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar. Error barsrepresent S.E. ± 5% based on three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A previous study has shown that overexpression of exogenous Bcl2 can protect cells from ceramide-induced cell death (14Zhang J. Alter N. Reed J.C. Borner C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93 (1996): 5325-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although this study did not address the phosphorylation status of Bcl2, the ceramide concentrations tested did not exceed 5 μm (14Zhang J. Alter N. Reed J.C. Borner C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93 (1996): 5325-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, exogenous Bcl2 may have undergone only incomplete dephosphorylation during the treatment time of cells, which could have allowed at least some protection. It is therefore interesting to speculate that ceramide may somehow suppress cell anti-apoptotic pathways involving Bcl2. Because most cell types are sensitive to ceramide but not all cells express Bcl2 (28Yang Y.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it would be important to determine the effect of ceramide on other Bcl2 family members. A recent study has shown that ceramide can block Bad phosphorylation through inactivation of the Bad kinase, Akt, and thus promote the pro-apoptotic function of Bad (29Basu S. Bayoumy S. Zhang Y. Lozano J. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30419-30426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ceramide was thought to function in this system was concluded to be independent of a PP2A-like phosphatase because treatment of cells with okadaic acid failed to reverse ceramide-induced inactivation of Akt (29Basu S. Bayoumy S. Zhang Y. Lozano J. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30419-30426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittmann R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). It thus appears that ceramide may have an inhibitory effect on Bcl2 family members by disrupting regulatory phosphorylation. Thus, ceramide can apparently have a dual role in promoting the pro-apoptotic activity of Bad while simultaneously blocking the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl2. Such an effect may have a profound additive or synergistic effect on apoptosis.The production of ceramide is so common during apoptosis induced by diverse stress stimuli (15Bose R. Verheij M.

It has been suggested that ceramide and diacylglycerol, two potent effectors situated at opposite ends of the sphingomyelin cycle, may have counterbalancing effects on cell growth and apoptosis (1Hannun Y.A.

At least one enzyme controlling the sphingomyelin cycle, sphingomyelin synthase, has been suggested to simultaneously regulate DAG and ceramide levels but in opposite directions (31Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2015202978,"We used mouse hepatoma (Hepa1c1c7) cells to study the role of the serine/threonine kinase Akt in the induction ofGLUT1 gene expression. In order to selectively turn on the Akt kinase cascade, we expressed a hydroxytamoxifen-regulatable form of Akt (myristoylated Akt1 estrogen receptor chimera (MER-Akt1)) in the Hepa1c1c7 cells; we verified that hydroxytamoxifen stimulates MER-Akt1 activity to a similar extent as the activation of endogenous Akt by insulin. Our studies reveal that stimulation of MER-Akt1 by hydroxytamoxifen induces GLUT1 mRNA and protein accumulation to levels comparable to that induced by insulin; therefore, activation of the Akt cascade suffices to induce GLUT1 gene expression in this cell system. Furthermore, expression of a kinase-inactive Akt mutant partially inhibits the response of the GLUT1 gene to insulin. Additional studies reveal that the induction of GLUT1 mRNA by Akt and by insulin reflects increased mRNA synthesis and not decreased mRNA degradation. Our findings imply that theGLUT1 gene responds to insulin at the transcriptional level and that Akt mediates a step in the activation of GLUT1gene expression in this system."

Possible direct downstream targets for these CAPP enzymes include c-Jun, protein kinase Cα, and Rb, which has been shown to function in ceramide-dependent cell cycle arrest pathways (3Ballou L.R.

Recent studies have demonstrated Rb as a specific substrate for PP1in vitro and as an in vivo target for CAPP with dephosphorylation of Rb resulting from ceramide treatment in MOLT-4 cells.2 Also in Molt-4 cells, protein kinase Cα has been demonstrated to be regulated by PP2A and not PP1 in response to ceramide, demonstrating substrate specificities between CAPP enzymes (25Lee J.Y.

Therefore, c-Jun, protein kinase Cα, and Rb are likely candidates for direct substrates of CAPP in mediating ceramide effects. Although short chain ceramides have clearly been demonstrated to activate the PP2A trimer (AB′C), PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), and PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) in vitro,2 a major problem has been the inability to utilize more natural long chain ceramides. In the present study, we overcome this problem of delivering long chain ceramides to both of the CAPP enzymes, PP1 and PP2A. We also characterize the enzymes under various physiological environments related to ceramide responsiveness. Myelin basic protein (MBP) purified from bovine brain, ATP, protein kinase A purified from bovine heart, and β-mercaptoethanol were purchased from Sigma. Dithiothreitol was obtained from Bachem, and dodecane was obtained from Aldrich. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products.

Recombinant human protein phosphatase-1γ catalytic subunit (PP1γc) and rabbit protein phosphatase-1α catalytic subunit (PP1αc) were purchased from Calbiochem. PP1αc is supplied preincubated with Mn2+. Myelin basic protein was labeled in a 0.5-ml reaction containing 1 mg of MBP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 90 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm cold ATP, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 40 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (0.2 mm), and 125 units of protein kinase A. After the components were mixed, the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. 170 μl of a 100% trichloroacetic acid solution was added, and labeled MBP was precipitated on ice for 20 min. The precipitated substrate was washed twice with acetone at −20 °C, air-dried, and reconstituted in 1 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. The specific activity of 32P-labeled MBP was ∼22 μCi/mg. C18-ceramide was brought up in a 2% dodecane-EtOH solution. The solution was dissolved by incubation at 37 °C. After solubilization, the ceramide solution was kept at 37 °C until addition to reaction tube. Egg yolk phosphatidic acid in chloroform was dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, by ultrasonication. Reactions were carried out in 13 × 100-mm borosilicate glass tubes. Solubilized ceramides were added to tubes containing PP1αc in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) with the EtOH concentration not exceeding 1%. Stock enzyme was diluted to 1units/ml in Buffer A, and 10 milliunits was added to each tube. Components were preincubated for 5 min at 30 °C. Reaction were initiated with 0.005 ml of 32P-labeled myelin basic protein (1 mg/ml) in Buffer A. After 20 min at 30 °C, the assay was terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml of 1 mmKH2PO4 in 1 N H2SO4followed by the addition of 0.3 ml 2% ammonium molybdate. After 10 min, 1 ml of isobutanol:toluene (1:1) was added, and each reaction was vortexed for 10 s. The reactions were centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min, and an aliquot of the upper organic phase was removed, mixed with scintillant, and counted. PP1γc, PP2A trimer, and PP2Ac were assayed as described for PP1αc. For PP1γc and PP1αc, 1 unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that will hydrolyze 1.0 nmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate/min at 30 °C, pH 7.0. For PP2A trimer and the catalytic subunit, 1 unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that will hydrolyze 1.0 nmol of phosphorylase/min at 30 °C, pH 7.0. Cell-permeable short chain ceramides have been shown to activate protein phosphatase-1 and -2A in vitro(22Merrill Jr., A.H. Schmelz E.-M. Dillehay D.L. Spiegel S. Shayman J.A. Schroeder J.J.

To overcome this problem of deliveryin vitro, we mixed long chain ceramides with 2% dodecane, resulting in a final reaction concentration of 0.02% dodecane and variable concentrations of ceramide (29Ji L. Zhang G. Uematsu S. Akahori Y. Hirabayashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Dodecane alone did not have any effect on phosphatase activity, but solubilizedd-erythro-C18-ceramide activated PP1αc (240% of control, EC50 = 8.75 μm), PP1γc (190% of control, EC50 = 11.5 μm), PP2Ac (179% of control, EC50 = 11.25 μm), and PP2A trimer (AB′C) (580% of control, EC50 = 10.6 μm) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1). Initial activation was not observed until d-erythro-C18-ceramide concentrations reached 7.5 μm with saturation occurring at 12.5–15.0 μmd-erythro-C18-ceramide for 10 milliunits of enzyme (Fig. 1). A nonspecific inhibition of both PP1 and PP2A enzymes was observed at lower doses (3 and 5 μm) of long chain ceramides (see below) (Fig. 1). To examine the stereospecificity of the phosphatase activation by long chain ceramides, we tested stereoisomers of C18-ceramide solubilized in dodecane (Fig. 2,A–D).d-Erythro-C18-ceramide (2S,3R) is the naturally occurring ceramide, withl-erythro-C18-ceramide (2R,3S) being its mirror image. The diastereoisomers, the threo conformations, differ fromerythro conformations in that the C-2 configuration relative to C-3 is in a cis-conformation. In the erythroconformation, the groups are in a trans-conformation. We found that, similar tod-erythro-C18-ceramide, each stereoisomer inhibited the phosphatases at low doses (3–5 μm), but onlyd-erythro-C18-ceramide activated each phosphatase at 7.5–15 μm (Fig. 2,A–D). In other studies, we have shown that PA inhibits protein phosphatase-1 but not PP2A activity in vitro. 3Kishikawa, K., Chalfant, C. E., Perry, D. K., Bielawska, A., and Hannun, Y. A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem., in press. Thus, we examined whether PA could regulate ceramide effects on PP1. Fig. 3 depicts PP1γc activity in the presence of 500 nm phosphatidic acid and increasing doses ofd-erythro-C18-ceramide. The addition of PA to the reaction lowered the basal activity of protein phosphatase-1 as expected, with 500 nm PA causing 95% inhibition of PP1γc (Fig. 3). The inhibition of PP1γc by low concentrations of long chain ceramides was relieved in the presence of PA, and the maximum stimulation by ceramide was enhanced from 374.3 to 581.0 fmol of Pi released/min (Fig. 3), such that in the presence of PA, the fold stimulation by ceramide increased up to 2.8-fold. Importantly, lower doses ofd-erythro-C18-ceramide were able to activate PP1γc with an EC50 of 4.45 μm. PP1αc behaved in a manner similar to PP1γc, with an increase in maximal stimulation from 472.8 to 738.8 fmol of Pi released/min and a decrease in the EC50 to 5.5 μm (data not shown). Stereospecificity was still retained for both PP1αc and PP1γc under these conditions, further demonstrating the specificity ofd-erythro-C18-ceramide (data not shown). Acidic phospholipids have been demonstrated to bind PP1 subunits under near physiological ionic strengths (30Ito M. Feng J. Tsujino S. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Tanaka J. Ichikawa K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7607-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether 150 mm KCl affected ceramide responsiveness and PA inhibition. The addition of KCl lowered the dose of d-erythro-C18-ceramide necessary for activation of each phosphatase and increased the maximal stimulation of PP1γc from 374.3 to 1753.3 fmol of Pireleased/min (EC50 = 6.25 μm) (Fig.4 A). Similarly, activation of PP1αc was increased from 472.8 to 4137 fmol of Pireleased/min (EC50 = 5.55 μm), PP2Ac from 352.6 to 1319.9 fmol of Pi released/min (EC50 = 6.75 μm), and PP2A (AB′C) trimer from 1152.5 to 2403.4 fmol of Pi released/min (EC50 = 6.25 μm) (data not shown). The addition of salt also decreased the basal activity of each phosphatase by 50%, and therefore the fold stimulation was even higher. For example, ceramide increased the fold stimulation of PP1γc from 1.9- to 8.9-fold in the presence of 150 mm KCl when compared with control activity in the absence of 150 mm KCl. The actual fold stimulation increased to 17.8-fold when compared with control activity in the presence of 150 mm KCl. Even low concentrations of KCl were able to increase ceramide responsiveness, as the addition of 15 mmKCl increased maximal stimulation of PP1γc to 1103.3 fmol of Pi released/min and decreased the EC50 to 9.0 μm (Fig. 4 A). Ceramide stereospecificity for each phosphatase was completely retained (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore,l-erythro-C18-ceramide and PA retained an inhibitory effect, but the IC50 increased from approximately 100 nm to 1 μm in the presence of 150 mm KCl (data not shown). Inhibition of CAPPs byd- andl-threo-C18-ceramides was relieved under these conditions of 150 mm KCl (Fig. 4 B). Also, the addition of 150 mm NaCl had the same effects as 150 mm KCl by both increasingd-erythro-C18-ceramide responsivenes and relieving nonspecific inhibitions by the other stereoisomers (data not shown). To examine whether the activation of PP1 and PP2A by long chain ceramides was dependent on or affected by cations, we preincubated the phosphatases with the different cations thought to be bound to the phosphatase metal binding site, Zn2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, and Mn2+ (31Chu Y. Lee E.Y.C. Schlender K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2574-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 depicts the effects of these cations on PP1γc activity. Unlike PP1αc, PP1γc is supplied without preincubation with Mn2+ and was therefore used for these studies. Similar to other laboratories, we found that Mn2+ increased PP1γc activity by 200% (Fig.5) (31Chu Y. Lee E.Y.C. Schlender K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2574-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PP2A trimer and PP2Ac behaved in a similar manner, demonstrating a 175% increase in activity when preincubated with Mn2+ (data not shown). Pre-binding PP1γc with Mn2+ increased the V max with ceramide from 1753.3 to 3201.3 fmol of Pi/min but had no effect on the overall fold stimulation by ceramide (Fig. 5). Mn2+ also had no effect on inhibition by PA (data not shown). Incubation with Co+2 acted to increase basal activity by 25%, but it had no effect on ceramide responsiveness (Fig.5). Incubation with Fe+2, Fe+3, or Zn+2 completely inhibited PP1 activity and ceramide activation (Fig. 5). Preincubation of the enzyme with Mn2+could not rescue the Zn2+ and Fe3+ inhibition (data not shown). Ceramide-activated protein phosphatase was initially identified as a phosphatase-activated by cell-permeabled-erythro-C2-ceramide, and at least two phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, are now known to respond to short chain ceramides (23Dobrowsky R.T.

Meyn R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2956-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Prior to this study, naturally occurring ceramides had not been shown to activate protein phosphatases. In this study, we demonstrate that, once solubilized with dodecane,d-erythro-C18-ceramide activates two CAPP enzymes, PP1 and PP2A. This activation was very specific, as the unnatural stereoisomers ofd-erythro-C18-ceramide did not activate PP1 nor PP2A. These observations are important for several reasons. First, specificity for ceramide is now clearly demonstrated for the long chain ceramide, and this stereochemical specificity is better defined with the long chain isomers than with the short chain ones. Second, a reproducible assay has now been developed that allows the study of CAPPs under more physiologic conditions (natural ceramides and near physiological ionic strength). Third, a specific ceramide-binding/interaction site is now inferred to be present on the catalytic subunit of at least PP1 and PP2A. Our system demonstrates strict stereospecificity ford-erythro-C18-ceramide, because neither its enantiomer,l-erythro-C18-ceramide, nor its diastereomers, d- andl-threo-C18-ceramide, increased CAPP activity. The fact that even the mirror image of naturally occurring d-erythro-C18-ceramide,l-erythro-C18-ceramide, did not activate the phosphatases shows that the interaction is very specific and not an environmental effect on the enzymes. In studying the optimal environment for delivery of long chain ceramides to CAPP, we initially found, as did Hirabayashi and co-workers (29Ji L. Zhang G. Uematsu S. Akahori Y. Hirabayashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) in cell studies, that dodecane acted as a useful vehicle for solubilizing long chain ceramides. We also found that the addition of near physiological levels of KCl to the reaction reduced inhibition of PP1 by both PA and long chain ceramides while enhancing ceramide activation of each phosphatase studied. Only PA andl-erythro-C18-ceramide remained inhibitory under these conditions, although the dose necessary for inhibition of PP1 was increased approximately 10-fold. Importantly, stereospecificity was still retained such thatd-erythro-C18-ceramide was very effective, whereas its enantiomer,l-erythro-C18-ceramide, lacked any activity. At this point, it is not clear why increasing the salt decreases the inhibition of PP1 by PA and low doses of long chain ceramides while enhancing the responsiveness of PP1 and PP2A tod-erythro-C18-ceramide. It is assumed that the enzyme's conformation is affected under physiological salt conditions such that with no salt, there is easier access to many lipids nonspecifically, whereas under near physiological ionic strength, interactions are more specific. These findings also suggest that a specific binding site ford-erythro-C18-ceramide is present on both the PP1 and PP2A catalytic subunits. The stereospecificity of this activation suggests a direct and specific interaction of ceramide with the catalytic subunits of these phosphatases. Because the enantiomer and diastereomers ofd-erythro-C18-ceramide do not activate the phosphatases, the orientation of the C-2 and C-3 carbons relative to the sphingolipid backbone is suggested to be important for proper interaction and binding of ceramide to CAPP. Another intriguing observation emerged with the finding that the PP2A heterotrimeric complex was activated to a greater extent than the catalytic subunit alone. This finding suggests that the A and B subunits of trimeric PP2A, which are important for compartmentalization and substrate specificity (38McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 39Cegielska A. Shaffer S. Derua R. Goris J. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4616-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), may also impart a conformation that allows for greater ceramide stimulation. Alternatively, ceramide may also interact with the A and B subunits to impart greater phosphatase activity. A third possibility is that A and B preferentially interact with a form of C that is more responsive to ceramide. These possibilities are currently under investigation. The dual action of PA andd-erythro-C18-ceramide on PP1 carries important implications for the physiological environment in which PP1 resides. CAPP phosphatases such as PP1 and PP2A have roles in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Therefore, a role for PA, a product of phospholipase D, may be hypothesized in the suppression of phosphatase activity until the proper stimuli (e.g. ceramide) are generated to protect the cell from undergoing premature apoptosis or inhibition of growth. Establishing the conditions necessary for delivery of long chain ceramides to PP1 and PP2A allowed us to examine the influence of cations on PP1 activity and ceramide responsiveness. We demonstrated, as had others, that preincubation with Mn2+ increased PP1c basal activity (31Chu Y. Lee E.Y.C. Schlender K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2574-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We also found that Mn2+ increased PP2Ac and PP2A trimer basal activity. Mn2+ did not, however, affect ceramide responsiveness. We also examined other cations of which Zn2+, Fe3+, and Fe2+potently inhibited PP1 and PP2A activity in vitro; ceramide was not able to overcome this inhibition of PP1 and PP2A. The inhibition may be the result of allosteric effects as suggested by Schlender and co-workers (31Chu Y. Lee E.Y.C. Schlender K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2574-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The influence of Zn+2inhibiting apotosis is well known (36Perry D.K. Smyth M.J. Stennicke H.R.

Mullbacher A. Sjaarda A. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1990; 12: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and our observations suggest yet another target for this anti-apoptotic cation. In this study, we have demonstrated that both PP1 and PP2A are activated by long chain ceramides and that this activation is stereospecific. We have also demonstrated that PA and salt have important effects on this activation by lowering the ceramide concentration necessary for achieving phosphatase activation. We also show that Fe2+/3+ and Zn2+ inhibit PP1 and PP2A activity, with ceramide not able to overcome cation inhibition. Clearly, this study demonstrates several new avenues of CAPP regulation and that physiologic environments can enable these enzymes to respond to natural ceramide rapidly and effectively."

A novel sterol regulatory element (SRE) (5′-AGCAGATTGTG-3′) identified in the proximal promoter of the mouse SCD2 gene is required for induction of SCD2 promoter-reporter genes in response to cellular sterol depletion (Tabor, D. E., Kim, J. B., Spiegelman, B. M., and Edwards, P. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 22052–22058).In this report, we demonstrate that this novel SRE is both present in the promoter of the SCD1 gene and is critical for the sterol-dependent transcription of SCD1 promoter-reporter genes. Two conserved cis elements (5′-CCAAT-3′) lie 5 and 48 base pairs 3′ of the novel SREs in the promoters of both the SCD1 and SCD2 murine genes. Mutation of either of these putative NF-Y binding sites attenuates the transcriptional activation of SCD1 or SCD2 promoter-reporter genes in response to cellular sterol deprivation. Induction of both reporter genes is also attenuated when cells are cotransfected with dominant-negative forms of either NF-Y or SREBP. In addition, we demonstrate that the induction of SCD1 and SCD2 mRNAs that occurs during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes is paralleled by an increase in the levels of ADD1/SREBP-1c and that the SCD1 and SCD2 mRNAs are induced to even higher levels in response to ectopic expression of ADD1/SREBP-1c. We conclude that transcription of both SCD1 and SCD2 genes is responsive to cellular sterol levels and to the levels of nuclear SREBP/ADD1 and that transcriptional induction requires three spatially conserved cis elements, that bind SREBP and NF-Y. Additional studies demonstrate that maximal transcriptional repression of SCD2 reporter genes in response to an exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid is dependent upon the SRE and the adjacent CCAAT motif.

SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c are derived from the SREBP-1 gene, resulting from the use of two different promoters plus alternative splicing of mRNAs (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Conversely, when levels of cellular sterols are high, proteolytic processing of SREBPs/ADD1 is diminished, nuclear levels of the mature proteins decline and transcription of target genes is low (1Brown M.S.

In contrast, reporter genes that contain intact SREs, but mutations in the NF-Y or Sp1 binding sites are transcriptionally crippled even in the presence of mature SREBP (10Ericsson J. Jackson S.M.

SREBP/ADD1 can also activate transcription indirectly; overexpression of SREBP/ADD1 results in activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR γ), apparently through stimulated production of an endogenous ligand for this nuclear receptor (16Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Promoters of a number of SREBP/ADD1-responsive genes have been analyzed to identify the nucleotide sequences necessary for SREBP/ADD1-DNA interaction. The results indicate that the nucleotide sequence of the different SREs varies considerably; many, but not all SREs, contain two half-sites (direct repeats of C/TCAC/T) separated by one nucleotide (8Magana M.M.

However, a number of SREs, including those identified in the promoters of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (5Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Other studies have demonstrated that SREBP/ADD1, unlike other proteins that contain a classic helix-loop-helix motif, has an atypical tyrosine in the DNA binding domain (17Kim J.B. Spotts G.D.

The result is a protein that binds to both an E-box motif (CANNTG) as well as varied SREs (17Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.-D. Shih H.-M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To identify genes not previously ascribed to be under the transcriptional control of SREBPs and cellular sterols, we recently utilized two mutant cell lines and mRNA differential display. This approach identified stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (SCD2) as an SREBP-regulated gene (9Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22052-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). SCD2 catalyzes the Δ9-cis desaturation of fatty acyl-CoAs (18Ntambi J.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The preferred substrates, stearoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA, are converted to oleoyl-CoA and palmitoleoyl-CoA, respectively (19Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second fatty acid desaturase gene, SCD1, encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the identical reaction (20Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Murine SCD1 and SCD2 genes colocalize to chromosome 19 (21Tabor D.E. Xia Y.-R. Mehrabian M. Edwards P.A. Lusis A.J. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 9: 341-342Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) consistent with gene duplication. In mice fed a triacylglycerol-free diet, both mRNAs are expressed in lung, kidney, and adipose tissue (19Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are some differences in the tissue expression of SCD1 and SCD2; for example, SCD1 mRNA, but not SCD2 mRNA is expressed in the liver, whereas SCD2 mRNA, but not SCD1 mRNA is expressed in the brain (19Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SCD1 and SCD2 mRNA levels are repressed in all tissues in response to dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with the exception that SCD2 is not repressed in the brain (19Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, exogenous PUFAs have been shown to decrease the transcription of the SCD1 gene (22Waters K.M. Ntambi J.M. Lipids. 1996; 31: 33-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary characterization of the SCD1 gene proximal promoter identified a 60-bp sequence that was termed a “PUFA response region” (23Waters K.M. Miller C.W. Ntambi J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the novel SRE, previously identified in the promoter of the SCD2 gene (9Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22052-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), is conserved in the promoter of the SCD1 gene and is required for sterol-regulated expression. We also demonstrate that sterol-regulated expression of both SCD1 and SCD2 promoter-reporter genes is dependent upon two additional cis elements (CCAAT) that are adjacent to the SRE. The finding that the novel SRE is located within the 60-bp PUFA response region, previously identified by Waters et al. (23Waters K.M. Miller C.W. Ntambi J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), raises the possibility that exogenous PUFAs repress transcription of the SCD1 and SCD2 genes by a process that requires an intact SRE. DNA modification and restriction enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. 32P- and35S-labeled nucleotide triphosphates were obtained from ANDOTEK Life Sciences Company. Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) was purchased from PerImmune. The HMG-CoA synthase reporter gene (pSYNSRE) and all other reagents have been described elsewhere (10Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B.

DNA fragments generated by PCR were subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) as described by the supplier. Escherichia coli, strain DH5α, were transformed and selected for growth on ampicillin-containing media. β-Galactosidase-deficient colonies were screened for the presence of inserts following EcoRI digestion of the plasmid DNA and electrophoretic analysis on 1% agarose gels. Inserts were sequenced by the Sanger chain-termination method using the T7 Sequenase v2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HepG2 and CV-1 cells were cultured as described previously (25Spear D.H. Kutsunai S.Y. Correll C.C. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14462-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

After 10–14 days, puromycin-resistant cells were pooled, replated, and grown to confluence (day 0 of differentiation). The cells were then induced to differentiate and subsequent media changes were performed as described (28Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The construction of a SCD2 promoter-reporter gene containing nucleotides −588 to +81 of the published SCD2 genomic sequence has been described (9Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22052-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The 5′ end of the SCD1 gene (nucleotides −589 to +81) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using C57Bl/6J mouse genomic DNA as a template. The 5′ primer contained nucleotides (5′-TACCCTCGAG-3′) containing anXhoI restriction site followed by nucleotides corresponding to −589 to −564 of the published SCD1 genomic sequence (20Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′ primer contained nucleotides (5′-ACTTAAGCTT-3′) containing aHindIII restriction site followed by nucleotides that corresponded to +25 to +1 of the published genomic sequence (20Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned into the pGL2 basic vector, usingXhoI and HindIII restriction sites to produce pSCD1–589. The 614-bp promoter sequence of pSCD1–589 (−589 to + 25) was identical to that reported by Ntambi et al. (20Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This DNA was used as template in an additional PCR, which used a 5′ primer corresponding to −454 to −427 of the SCD1 genomic sequence in combination with the same 3′ primer described above. The PCR product was cloned into the pGL2 basic vector, using XhoI andHindIII restriction sites to produce pSCD2–454. The sequences of PCR products were confirmed and shown to contain the expected sequence. Oligonucleotides (28-mers) were used to introduce mutations into pSCD1–589 and pSCD2–199 using QuikChange (Stratagene). The resulting SCD1 reporter genes contained T to G and C to A mutations at positions −494 and −493 (pSCD1–589-SREMut), three A to C mutations at positions −423, −420, and −418 (pSCD1–589-MutA), C to A and A to C mutations at positions −406, −405, and −363, −362 (pSCD1–589-NF-Y1 and pSCD1–589-NF-Y2, respectively) and two C to T mutations at positions −213 and −211 (pSCD1–589-Sp1). The resulting SCD2 reporter genes contained C to A and A to C mutations at positions −134, −133, and −91, −90 (pSCD2–199-NF-Y1 and pSCD2–199-NF-Y2), and two G to A mutations at positions −174 and −172 (pSCD2–199-Sp1). Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc). 10 μg of each RNA sample was fractionated by agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and cross-linked by exposure to UV light as described (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). SCD1 and SCD2 gene-specific DNA probes corresponding to nucleotides 2910 to 3797 and 3623 to 4685, respectively, were generated as described (21Tabor D.E. Xia Y.-R. Mehrabian M. Edwards P.A. Lusis A.J. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 9: 341-342Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled DNA probes were generated by the random priming labeling method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization and quantification, using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) were as described (30Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Metherall J.E. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1712-1721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To correct for differences in RNA loading in each lane, blots were also hybridized to a probe, 36B4, that hybridized to a constitutively expressed mRNA. Transient transfections were performed using minor modifications of the transfection MBS kit (Stratagene). Details of the transient transfection of HepG2 cells with luciferase reporter genes, a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase, and pCI-SREBP-1a (encoding mature SREBP-1a) appear in previous publications (5Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Spear D.H. Kutsunai S.Y. Correll C.C. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14462-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following transfection, cells were incubated for 20 h in medium containing 10% LPDS supplemented with either 5 μm mevinolin (inducing medium) or sterols (10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol) (repressing medium). The cells were lysed, and the luciferase activities determined and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity to correct for minor differences in transfection efficiency. The normalized values from duplicate dishes varied less than 10%. Complementary single-stranded DNAs containing wild-type or mutated sequences were annealed, the double-stranded DNA was isolated and end-labeled with 32P as described (5Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled DNA (20,000 cpm; 1.5 fmol) was incubated with recombinant histidine-tagged SREBP-1a (amino acids 1–490) and the electrophoretic mobility shift assays performed as described previously (5Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The amount of recombinant protein is indicated in the specific legends. Analysis of the published nucleotide sequence of the proximal promoters of the murine SCD1 and SCD2 genes revealed the presence of a number of conserved elements (Fig. 1). These conserved elements include the novel SRE previously identified and characterized in the SCD2 promoter (9Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22052-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, solid square) and two putative binding sites (CCAAT) for NF-Y that are 5- and 48-bp 3′ of the novel SRE (Fig. 1, solid triangles). The novel SRE of the SCD1 promoter shows 9/10 identity with the corresponding sequence in the SCD2 promoter (Fig. 1) (9Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22052-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, both proximal promoters contain a putative binding site for Sp1 (Fig.1, solid circle). The two CCAAT elements and the putative Sp1 binding site had been previously identified, but not functionally characterized by Waters et al. (23Waters K.M. Miller C.W. Ntambi J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in studies designed to identify a PUFA response element. Interestingly, the novel SRE and the most adjacent NF-Y binding site lie within a highly conserved 60-bp that Waters et al. (23Waters K.M. Miller C.W. Ntambi J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) termed a PUFA response sequence (Fig. 1, solid underline). The SCD1 promoter also contains a sequence with 9/10 identity with the well characterized SRE-1 originally identified in the promoter of the LDL receptor gene (Fig. 1,open square). Based on the sequence and spatial conservation of the SRE and CCAAT motifs in the promoters of the SCD1 and SCD2 genes, we hypothesized that the transcription of both genes would be activated in an SREBP/ADD1- and NF-Y-dependent manner. However, because both promoters also contain putative Sp1 binding sites and the transcription of a number of SREBP-dependent genes is known to require Sp1 (4Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Sp1 might also be important in transcriptional activation. Fig. 2 shows that the mRNA levels for SCD1 and SCD2 increase 20- and 1.8-fold, respectively, during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes (comparelanes 1 and 4). These data are consistent with a previous report (19Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the levels of ADD1 mRNA, the rat homolog of SREBP-1c, increase during this differentiation process (10Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To determine whether these increases in SCD mRNA levels are affected by levels of mature ADD1, the preadipocytes were infected with a retrovirus that expressed either wild-type ADD1 or a dominant-negative form of ADD1, termed ADD1-DN (28Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). As compared with uninfected cells, ectopic expression of ADD1 led to further increases in SCD1 and SCD2 mRNA levels; after 6 days of differentiation, the mRNA levels of SCD1 and SCD2 increased an additional 2.7- and 1.4-fold, respectively (Fig. 2, lanes 4 versus 5). Thus, in the presence of ectopically expressed ADD1, the mRNA levels of SCD1 and SCD2 increased 55- and 2.5-fold during differentiation. In contrast, ectopic expression of ADD1-DN attenuated the normal increases in SCD1 and SCD2 mRNA levels (Fig. 2, lanes 4 versus 6). Taken together, these results are consistent with a stimulatory role for ADD1/SREBP-1c in the transcriptional regulation of the SCD1 and SCD2 genes during adipocyte differentiation. We next sought to determine whether expression of an SCD1 promoter-reporter gene was regulated in response to either coexpression of transcriptionally active SREBP or to alterations in the cellular sterol status of the cell. An SCD2 reporter construct served as a positive control (9Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22052-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). SCD1 and SCD2 promoter-reporter constructs were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells together with a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase under the control of a nonregulated, cytomegalovirus-derived promoter. The cells were then incubated for 20 h in medium containing 10% LPDS and either 5 μm mevinolin or sterols (10 μg/ml cholesterol, 1.0 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol), lysed, and the luciferase activities determined. The β-galactosidase activity was used to normalize luciferase activities for minor"

Their N-terminal globular domain binds to hyaluronan, but the function of their C-terminal region containing a C-type lectin domain is less clear. We now report that a 90-kDa protein copurifies with recombinant lectin domains from aggrecan and versican, but not from the brain-specific neurocan and brevican. Amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides from this protein identified it as fibulin-1. This extracellular matrix glycoprotein is strongly expressed in tissues where versican is expressed (blood vessels, skin, and developing heart), and also expressed in developing cartilage and bone. It is thus likely to interact with these proteoglycans in vivo. Surface plasmon resonance measurements confirmed that aggrecan and versican lectin domains bind fibulin-1, whereas brevican and neurocan do not. As expected for a C-type lectin, the interactions with fibulin-1 are Ca2+-dependent, withK D values in the low nanomolar range. Using various deletion mutants, the binding site for aggrecan and versican lectin domains was mapped to the epidermal growth factor-like repeats in domain II of fibulin-1. No difference in affinity was found for deglycosylated fibulin-1, indicating that the proteoglycan C-type lectin domains bind to the protein part of fibulin-1.

It has long been known that these proteoglycans are anchored to the hyaluronan meshwork through their N-terminal globular domains, in link protein-stabilized complexes (7Heinegård D. Hascall V.C. J.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 13Rauch U. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although neurocan and brevican expression is restricted to the central nervous system, aggrecan is prominent in cartilage only (14Heinegård D. Oldberg A. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2042-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), while versican is widely expressed in the extracellular matrix of many tissues, notably blood vessels and skin (15Bode-Lesniewska B.

Until now, no extra-neuronal ligand for the C-terminal globular domains of aggrecan and versican has been identified. We now report that the fibrillar extracellular matrix protein fibulin-1 is such a ligand. Fibulin-1 was previously shown to be an elongated protein which consists of three domains (I-III) with different molecular structures. The C-terminal domain III can be varied by splicing (variants A-D) and this was shown to affect its binding properties to nidogen-1 (16Argraves W.S. Tran H. Burgess W.H. Dickerson K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3155-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17Pan T.C. Kluge M. Zhang R.Z. Mayer U. Timpl R. Chu M.L. Eur. J.

Here we show that fibulin-1 binds to the C-type lectin domains of versican and aggrecan with high affinity, but shows no binding to the brain-specific proteoglycans brevican and neurocan. We also map the binding site on the fibulin-1 molecule to the central stretch of calcium binding EGF 1The abbreviations EGFepidermal growth factorrCLDrecombinant C-type lectin domainPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight -like repeats.

Plasmids for expression of aggrecan and neurocan lectin-like domains were constructed by transferring the expression cassette from the pcDNA3 vectors (12Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting expression vectors code for an immunoglobulin signal peptide, a C-type lectin-like domain and a hexahistidine tag. After cleavage of the signal peptide the resulting secreted recombinant proteins have an N-terminal Arg residue preceding the C-type lectin domain (amino acid residues 1909–2037, 659–787, 1024–1152, and 2177–2306 of aggrecan (2Doege K.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), respectively), followed by the C-terminal shared sequence Ser-Thr-(His)6. The expression plasmids were transfected into human embryonal kidney 293-EBNA cells using LipofectAMINE. After 1 day of recovery, the cells were subjected to selection with 260 μm hygromycin and survivors were allowed to grow to confluency For large scale production of recombinant His-tagged lectin domains, conditioned medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum) was collected from 20 15-cm culture dishes of confluent producer cells every second day. After harvest, the medium was cleared of detached cells and debris through centrifugation, Tris-HCl (1 m, pH 8.0) was added to a final concentration of 50 mm, and 5 m NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m. Ni-NTA superflow-beads (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) were equilibrated in Buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl), and added to the medium. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min the beads were transferred to a column, and washed with Buffer A until theA 280 of the flow-through was stable. The His-tagged proteins were eluted with 20 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ HR 5/5 (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) column with salt elution (0–1 mNaCl gradient over 20 column bed volumes, in 20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Purified proteins were subjected to N-terminal sequencing of the first 10 amino acid residues after the signal peptide cleavage site, and the sequences obtained were in complete agreement with the predicted sequences. These recombinant proteins are referred to as rCLD (recombinant C-type lectin domain) in this paper. The purified protein was separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel, and digested in the gel (19Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega). The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance chromatography on a C2/C18 column (μRPC C2/C18, SC 2.1/10, Pharmacia), using a 0–80% acetonitrile gradient over 170 min. Selected peaks were further purified on a Sephasil C8 SC 2.1/10 column (Pharmacia) using a 0–80% acetonitrile gradient over 170 min. Peptides were sequenced on a ABI 476A automatic protein sequenator (Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA), according to the manufacturers instructions. The affinity purified anti-mouse fibulin-1 antiserum has been previously described (20Fässler R. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Chu M.L. Werner S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An anti-rat aggrecan antiserum was raised against an A1-D1-D1 fraction of rat chondrosarcoma extract. The anti-versican monoclonal antibody 12C5 (21Asher R. Perides G. Vanderhaeghen J.J. Bignami A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA. Tissue was obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats and NMRI mice after CO2 eutanasia, fixed in 95% ethanol, 1% acetic acid (22Sainte-Marie G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1962; 10: 250-256Crossref Google Scholar), dehydrated, embedded in low melting point paraffin, and cut into 4-μm sections. After deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched through incubation for 15 min in 1% H2O2 in methanol. For some tissues the sections were then incubated with hyaluronidase (2 mg/ml, 30 min room temperature) to remove glycosaminoglycans and unmask antigens. Unspecific binding was blocked by incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. Antigen was then detected through incubation with primary antibodies diluted in 0.3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, biotinylated secondary antibodies, and avidin/biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The production of most of the recombinant fibulin-1 proteins has previously been described (18Sasaki T. Kostka G. Göhring W. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Chu M.L. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,23Adam S. Göhring W. Wiedemann H. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Kostka G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The fragments II8–9+III, II7–9+III, and II6–9+III, were produced by amplifying the corresponding regions of the cDNA, nucleotides 1324, 1450, and 1570 to 2241, respectively, in the mouse fibulin-1 sequence (17Pan T.C. Kluge M. Zhang R.Z. Mayer U. Timpl R. Chu M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Primers were used in the polymerase chain reaction that introduced a NheI site immediately upstream, and an XbaI site immediately downstream of the fibulin-1 fragment. The resulting products were then introduced into the pCEP4 mammalian expression vector containing the BM-40 signal peptide (24Mayer U. Nischt R. Pöschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins all contain the vector-derived amino acid sequence APLA preceding the first amino acid residue of the fibulin-1 fragment. The recombinant proteins were produced in 293-EBNA cells, purified, and characterized as described previously (23Adam S. Göhring W. Wiedemann H. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Kostka G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The different proteoglycan rCLDs were diluted with 10 mm acetate (pH 4.0) and immobilized in different flowcells of a CM5 sensorchip (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Immobilization levels were between 250 and 2000 resonance units, giving responses of 50–600 resonance units, as described previously (12Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the affinity measurements, recombinant proteins, at different concentrations, were injected on the rCLD-coated surfaces at 35 μl/min (in 10 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.005% P20, 25 °C), and the binding and dissociation was registered in a BiaCore 2000 instrument. The lectin surfaces were regenerated by injection of a 200-μl pulse of 20 mm EDTA (in the same buffer) between each experiment. In control experiments with the same concentrations of recombinant proteins, but with 5 mm EDTA instead of CaCl2 in the buffer, no binding was seen. In experiments to map the interaction, a constant concentration of 300 nmrecombinant fibulin, or its fragments was used. Bacterially expressed fibronectin type III repeats 3–5 from rat tenascin-R was used as a positive control (12Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Association (k a) and dissociation (k d) rate constants were determined using the homogenous kinetic models (A + B = AB type 1, and AB = A + B, respectively) in the BiaEvaluation 2.1 program. The equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) were calculated from these values. Recombinant fibulin-1D (5 μg) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 was digested with 0.2 units ofN-glycanase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) at 37 °C overnight. Samples (500 ng) of digested and undigested fibulin-1D incubated in parallel were separated on a 4–16% gel. Other aliquots of the material were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The affinities for the deglycosylated and control fibulin-1 were determined using surface plasmon resonance, as described above. We observed that a 90-kDa protein copurified with select rCLD proteins in Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography from conditioned medium of transfected human embryonal kidney 293-EBNA cells (Fig.1). This protein notably copurifies with the rCLDs of aggrecan and versican, but not with those of the brain-specific neurocan or brevican (Fig. 1). It thus appears that it could be ligand-specific for the non-neuronal proteoglycan C-type lectin domains. The 90-kDa protein from the Ni-NTA-agarose column eluate was purified to apparent homogeneity on a MonoQ ion exchange chromatography column. After separation on a SDS-PAGE gel, the band corresponding to the protein was digested with trypsin. The released peptides were separated using reverse phase high performance chromatography and the amino acid sequences of two of the peptides were determined. A BLAST homology search revealed that both peptides were apparently derived from the extracellular matrix protein fibulin-1 (Fig.2). The amino acid sequence of peptide D was identical to the mouse and human fibulin sequence, but, as is clear from the sequence of peptide E, the isolated fibulin is neither the human nor the mouse homologue, but rather should represent copurified bovine fibulin-1 from the fetal calf serum in the culture medium. Immunohistochemical stainings to identify the localization of the different proteins in various tissues demonstrated that versican and fibulin-1 show overlapping deposits both in skin and aorta. In addition, aggrecan and fibulin-1 both show a generalized presence in embryonic cartilage. In rat skin, fibulin-1 is expressed in a fibrillar pattern throughout the dermis (Fig. 3 A), reminiscent of the elastic fiber network. In particular, the hair follicles are surrounded by intense staining, and a thin layer at the dermal/epidermal border is distinctly stained. Versican staining in rat skin is very similar to the fibulin-1 staining (Fig. 3 B), showing the same pattern in the dermis, at the dermal/epidermal border and in the hair follicles. In rat aorta, fibulin-1 is found throughout the vessel wall, albeit the staining is more intense in the subintimal layers of the tunica media, in the tunica adventitia, and in the outer elastic capsule (Fig.3 C). Versican staining in the rat aorta overlaps with fibulin-1 (Fig. 3 D), but is restricted to the subintimal layer of the media, and to the outer elastic capsule. No versican staining was found in the adventitia. We did not detect any fibulin-1 epitopes in adult rat cartilage. As shown in Fig. 3 E, the capsule surrounding tracheal cartilage stains strongly for fibulin-1, but no staining is seen in the cartilage, although good antibody penetration is evident from the aggrecan staining (Fig. 3 F). In contrast, during development there is strong fibulin-1 expression in the cartilage templates and the newly formed bone during endochondral ossification (Fig.3 G), where aggrecan expression is also prominent (Fig.3 H). The interaction between different recombinant fibulin-1 splice variants, expressed in 293 cells (18Sasaki T. Kostka G. Göhring W. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Chu M.L. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was measured with surface plasmon resonance technology using a BIAcore 2000. The recombinant fibulins were flowed over the sensorchip with immobilized lectican rCLDs and bound material was measured over time. All fibulin-1 splice variants examined (A, C, and D) showed strong binding to versican (Fig. 4, TableI) and aggrecan rCLDs (Table I). This binding was completely dependent on calcium ions, as expected for a C-type lectin. None of the fibulins bound to the rCLDs of the brain-specific proteoglycans neurocan and brevican (Fig. 4, Table I). That these proteins showed adequate folding was verified in control experiments where they bound a recombinant fragment of tenascin-R, previously shown to bind all the proteoglycan rCLDs (12Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The affinities for different fibulin-1 splice variants were in the low nanomolar range (Table I).Table IDissociation equilibrium constants for the interactions between the different lectican rCLDs and fibulin-1C, fibulin-1D, and tenascin-RK DFibulin-1CFibulin-1DTenascin-RnMAggrecan321112Versican143815BrevicanNBaNB, no binding.NB1NeurocanNBNB31Data was obtained by surface plasmon resonance analysis.a NB, no binding. Open table in a new tab Data was obtained by surface plasmon resonance analysis. The interaction sites for the proteoglycan rCLDs on the fibulin-1C molecule were mapped using a large number of different distal and internal deletion mutants (Fig.5), expressed in recombinant form in 293-EBNA cells (23Adam S. Göhring W. Wiedemann H. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Kostka G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As can be seen from TableII, the central domain II (fragment II) is sufficient for undiminished aggrecan/versican rCLD binding. Deletion of the central calcium-binding EGF repeats (fragment ΔII2–8) completely abolished aggrecan and versican rCLD binding, which confirmed the data and indicated that EGF-like modules 1 and 9 make no essential contributions to the binding epitopes. Since no isolated subfragment of this restricted region could be identified as crucial for versican rCLD binding, we conclude that several (at least two) binding sites for versican may exist within the II2–8 region (compare the ΔII2–3, ΔII2–5, ΔII4–5, and ΔII6–8 fragments). The aggrecan rCLD showed a somewhat different binding pattern, in that the fragment II8–9+III, but not II9+III, is sufficient for binding with a similar affinity as fragment II and full-length fibulin-1 (Table II). No contributions to binding are obvious for the terminal domains I and III. This is different to the binding site for nidogen-1 (23Adam S. Göhring W. Wiedemann H. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Kostka G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which also includes domain III (Fig. 5).Table IIMapping of the binding site on fibulin-1 for the C-type lectin-like domains of aggrecan and versican by surface plasmon resonance affinity measurementsLigand (300 nm)Aggrecan lectin domain immobilizedVersican lectin domain immobilizedk assk dissK Dk assk dissK Dm −1s −1s −1nmm −1s −1s −1nmFibulin-1D169,0002.75 × 10−316.284,7002.75 × 10−332.5Fibulin-1C210,0001.95 × 10−39.372,0000.91 × 10−312.6Fibulin-1A165,0001.57 × 10−39.582,1001.23 × 10−315.0Fragment II+III239,0004.71 × 10−319.7181,0003.58 × 10−319.8Fragment II124,0001.06 × 10−38.564,4000.76 × 10−311.8Fragment ΔII2–3181,0004.44 × 10−324.640,1001.45 × 10−336.2Fragment ΔII4–5196,0003.43 × 10−317.531,7001.43 × 10−345.1Fragment ΔII6–8235,0004.72 × 10−320.182,2001.54 × 10−318.7Fragment ΔII2–5176,0002.99 × 10−317.031,8001.33 × 10−341.8Fragment ΔII2–8No bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingFragment II9+IIINo bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingFragment II8–9+III143,0001.24 × 10−38.793,3005.75 × 10−3616.3Fragment II7–9+III90,8001.10 × 10−312.1105,00010.00 × 10−395.2Fragment II6–9+III36,0001.10 × 10−330.677,0006.98 × 10−390.6Affinity constants for the interactions between lectican rCLDs and 300 nm of different recombinant fibulin-1 splice variants, fragments, and deletion mutant proteins. Open table in a new tab Affinity constants for the interactions between lectican rCLDs and 300 nm of different recombinant fibulin-1 splice variants, fragments, and deletion mutant proteins. Mouse fibulin-1D expressed in 293/EBNA cells has been shown to be free of classical O-linked glycosylation, since hexosamine analysis showed no galactosamine (18Sasaki T. Kostka G. Göhring W. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Chu M.L. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To study effects of any N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides, recombinant mouse fibulin-1D from 293-EBNA cells was enzymatically deglycosylated with N-glycanase F. An aliquot, 0.5 μg, was separated by SDS-PAGE and silver stained to confirm deglycosylation (Fig. 6). To evaluate the extent of deglycosylation, aliquots of the material were subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As shown in Table III, the fibulin-1D mass was decreased from 82.3 to 75.4 kDa. Characterization of the interaction between versican and aggrecan rCLDs and fibulin-1D by surface plasmon resonance revealed no significant difference in affinities after deglycosylation (Table III). This suggests that the proteoglycans rCLDs bind directly to the fibulin-1 core protein, as is the case for tenascin-R (12Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M.

Removal of the N-linked glycans was confirmed by mass spectrometry. In this paper we demonstrate that fibulin-1 is a high affinity ligand for the C-type lectin domains of the proteoglycans versican and aggrecan. This is the first example of a ligand for such CLDs that shows specificity for certain lectican proteoglycans, since it does not bind the brain-specific proteoglycans neurocan and brevican belonging to the same proteoglycan family. We found that fibulin-1 in solution bound to and coprecipitated with recombinant versican and aggrecan CLDs in cell culture supernatants where fetal calf serum was present (Fig.1). The affinities for versican and aggrecan rCLDs were in the low nanomolar range, as measured by surface plasmon resonance technology (Table I), whereas binding to neurocan or brevican rCLDs could not be detected (Fig. 4, Table I). Analogous to the interaction with tenascin-R (12Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), this binding seems to be directed to the protein part of fibulin-1 (Fig. 6, Table III). Indeed, there are a number of C-type lectin domains that rather than using carbohydrate will bind to the protein part of their ligands. Examples are the low affinity IgE Fc receptor (25Vercelli D. Helm B. Marsh P. Padlan E. Geha R.S. Gould H. Nature. 1989; 338: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the natural killer cell receptor Ly-49A (26Matsumoto N. Ribaudo R.K. Abastado J.P. Margulies D.H. Yokoyama W.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mapping of the interaction site on the fibulin-1 molecule revealed that the proteoglycan rCLDs bind to one or more calcium-binding EGF-like repeat(s) in the central rod-like domain of the molecule. As seen in Fig. 5 and Table II, the aggrecan rCLD clearly binds to EGF-like modules 8–9, and, although the versican rCLD shows a somewhat different binding profile, it also binds to similar modules in the central rod-like domain II, with no apparent involvement of domains I or III. In contrast, the nidogen-1 interaction with fibulin-1 (23Adam S. Göhring W. Wiedemann H. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Kostka G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), shows quite different characteristics, and was completely abolished by deletion of domain III, but also dependent on the presence of EGF-like repeats 6–9. The fibulin-1 self-assembly and fibronectin-binding sites, however, require only EGF-like repeats 5 and 6, but differ in their dependence on calcium (27Tran H. VanDusen W.J. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22600-22606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that although the proteoglycan rCLDs bind to fibulin-1 through EGF-like repeats, they bind to a fibronectin type III repeat in tenascin-R, a brain-specific ligand for the CLDs of all the proteoglycans in this family (12Aspberg A.

Since tenascin-R is a dimer or trimer (28Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and fibulin-1 may self-assemble (17Pan T.C.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20120-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the binding in both cases seems directed to extended rod-like stretches of multimeric extracellular matrix molecules. The tissue colocalization of fibulin-1 with versican or aggrecan immunoreactivity indicates that these interactions could be of physiological relevance. As shown in Fig. 3, both versican and fibulin-1 give strong signals in the extracellular matrix of rat dermis, particularly in the hair follicles, but also in a layer at the epidermal/dermal border, and in a reticular pattern throughout the dermis. Similarly, in human skin, both versican and fibulin-1 are found in the same locations, including the elastic fibers of the dermis (30Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 31du Cros D.L. LeBaron R.G. Couchman J.R. J. Invest.

Indeed, mouse and human fibulin-2 was shown to bind to fibrillin-1, a molecule associated with the surface of elastic fibers (33Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although mouse fibulin-1 did not bind fibrillin-1 (33Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) it is unclear whether the human or rat homologues do, or whether any of the fibulins bind fibrillin-2. Interestingly, both versican and fibulin-1 are up-regulated in damaged skin, suggesting a functional association between the molecules (20Fässler R. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Chu M.L. Werner S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34Bernstein E.F. Fisher L.W. Li K. LeBaron R.G. Tan E.M. Uitto J. Lab.

As shown in Fig. 3, versican and fibulin-1 proteins both are found in the subintimal layer of the tunica media of rat aorta, as well as in the outer elastic capsule. Similar findings have been described in human blood vessels, where versican staining was found in all layers of the aortic wall, in the tunica adventitia of muscular arteries, in all veins examined and surrounding all capillaries (except in the kidney glomeruli) (15Bode-Lesniewska B.

Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Strong fibulin-1 immunostaining was also found in the media of virtually all human blood vessels (32Roark E.F. Keene D.R. Haudenschild C.C. Godyna S. Little C.D. Argraves W.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Similarly to the situation in skin, versican expression in blood vessels is strongly up-regulated by different types of damage to the vessel wall. For example, intense versican staining was found in human vessels with split internal elastic lamina (15Bode-Lesniewska B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Odermatt B.F. Briner J. Heitz P.U. Zimmermann D.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and in restenotic neointima in human arteries after angioplasty (37Matsuura R. Isaka N. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Yoshida T. Sakakura T. Nakano T. J. Pathol. 1996; 180: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is as yet unclear whether fibulin-1 is also up-regulated in response to damage in blood vessels. During heart development, both versican and fibulin-1 are strongly expressed in the endocardial cushion tissue (38Spence S.G. Argraves W.S. Walters L. Hungerford J.E. Little C.D. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 39Zhang H.Y. Chu M.L. Pan T.C. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Dev.

Herken R. Timpl R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An interaction between the molecules is supported by immunogold electron microscopy colocalization in the endocardial cushion tissue. Indeed, treatment of sections with hyaluronidase to degrade hyaluronic acid leads to removal of both versican and fibulin whereas fibronectin staining remains unaffected (42Miosge N. Sasaki T. Chu M.L. Herken R. Timpl R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, disruption of the versican gene results in early embryonic death due to failure to form the endocardial cushion and the right cardiac chamber (43Yamamura H. Zhang M. Markwald R.R. Mjaatvedt C.H. Dev. Biol. 1997; 186: 58-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 44Mjaatvedt C.H. Yamamura H. Capehart A.A. Turner D. Markwald R.R. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This indicates that the correct formation of a hyaluronan-versican-fibulin network may be important for heart development. Despite the lack of fibulin-1 in adult cartilage, we found strong fibulin-1 staining in the growth plates of mouse embryo femur (Fig.3 G). This overlaps with aggrecan staining (Fig.3 H). Indeed, high levels of fibulin-1 expression have been previously reported in precartilaginous mesenchymal condensations and developing cartilage (40Zhang H.Y. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Chu M.L. Ekblom P. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 205: 348-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 45Miosge N. Götz W. Sasaki T. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Herken R. Histochem. J. 1996; 28: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It may be that fibulin-1 binding by the aggrecan C-type lectin domain plays a special role during the development of cartilage and bone, perhaps assisting in organizing the early matrix. However, versican may also in this context be another relevant binding partner for fibulin-1, since versican expression precedes aggrecan in the development of cartilage (46Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Shinomura T. Yamagata M. Uritani M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13517-13525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Bignami A. Perides G. Rahemtulla F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The biological functions of the interactions between the proteoglycan C-type lectin-like domains and fibulin-1 (or tenascin-R) remains unclear. Since both of these ligands form multimeric complexes in the extracellular matrix, it is probable that the proteoglycans act to bridge or organize other matrix constituents, e.g.connecting the hyaluronan meshwork with a matrix network represented by fibulin. As already alluded to above, there are several genes in the fibulin family: fibulin-1 (16Argraves W.S. Tran H. Burgess W.H. Dickerson K. J.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism, we examined the quantitative relationships between the binding of HDL and the selective uptake of its CE in the murine adrenal Y1-BS1 cell line. A comparison of concentration dependences shows that half-maximal high affinity cell association of HDL occurs at 8.7 ± 4.7 μg/ml and the K m of HDL-CE-selective uptake is 4.5 ± 1.5 μg/ml. These values are similar, and there is a very high correlation between these two processes (r 2 = 0.98), suggesting that they are linked. An examination of lipid uptake from reconstituted HDL particles of defined composition and size shows that there is a non-stoichiometric uptake of HDL lipid components, with CE being preferred over the major HDL phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. Comparison of the rates of selective uptake of different classes of phospholipid in this system gives the ranking: phosphatidylserine > phosphatidylcholine ≈ phosphatidylinositol > sphingomyelin. The rate of CE-selective uptake from donor particles is proportional to the amount of CE initially present in the particles, suggesting a mechanism in which CE moves down its concentration gradient from HDL particles docked on SR-BI into the cell plasma membrane. The activation energy for CE uptake from either HDL3 or reconstituted HDL is about 9 kcal/mol, indicating that HDL-CE uptake occurs via a non-aqueous pathway. HDL binding to SR-BI allows access of CE molecules to a “channel” formed by the receptor from which water is excluded and along which HDL-CE molecules move down their concentration gradient into the cell plasma membrane.

Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar). The cholesteryl ester (CE) in the LDL particles is hydrolyzed to free cholesterol in lysosomes. Since non-steroidogenic cells cannot catabolize cholesterol, homeostasis is maintained by efflux of free cholesterol to extracellular high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (2Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The concentration gradient required for net efflux of cell cholesterol mass is maintained by the action of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, which converts free cholesterol in HDL to CE. This CE is then returned to the liver by the reverse cholesterol transport pathway (3Barter P.J. Rye K.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition to this flux of HDL-CE to the liver, where it can be converted into bile acids, HDL-CE is used by steroidogenic cells such as adrenal, ovary, and testis for production of steroid hormones (4Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4077-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In rodents, HDL cholesterol is taken up by adrenal cells in vitro (5Gwynne J.T. Mahaffee D.

The HDL-dependent increase in corticosterone production in cultured rat adrenocortical cells greatly exceeds what can be accounted for by HDL particle uptake and degradation by the cell, suggesting that HDL-CE is taken up by the cell without concomitant uptake of the HDL particle (8Gwynne J.T. Hess B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10875-10883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in vivo and in cell culture have shown directly that HDL-CE is taken up by adrenal cells without HDL particle uptake and degradation (9Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D.

Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). In contrast, HDL-CE is preferentially taken up by a variety of tissues and cell types by a non-endocytic mechanism without either degradation of apolipoproteins or whole particle uptake (10Pittman R.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor Jr., C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CE from HDL is transferred to cell plasma membranes by a passive process that is dependent on the cholesterol content of the membrane (14Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1179-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, CE molecules are irreversibly transferred into the cell interior (16Rinninger F. Jaeckle S. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and are hydrolyzed by a non-lysosomal mechanism (17Gwynne J.T. Mahaffee D.D. J. Biol.

When reconstituted HDL particles containing different apolipoproteins were studied in cultured adrenal cells, the HDL-CE-selective uptake process showed only a modest preference for apolipoprotein (apo) A-I (19Pittman R.C. Glass C.K. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2435-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although apoA-I appears to be essentialin vivo (20Plump A.S. Erickson S.K. Weng W. Partin J.S. Breslow J.L. Williams D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although the HDL-CE-selective uptake pathway has been extensively studied and characterized, understanding of the mechanisms by which the hydrophobic CE molecules are transferred from the HDL core to the plasma membrane has remained elusive. The recent demonstration that scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) mediates the selective uptake of HDL-CE in transfected cells provides an important link between the selective uptake pathway and a specific cell surface receptor (21Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). These studies showed that expression of SR-BI in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells resulted in HDL binding and the selective uptake of a fluorescent lipid probe and CE (21Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). This report provided strong evidence that a cell surface receptor may mediate the uptake of HDL-CE into cells; similar results have been reported with the human homologue, CLA-1 (22Murao K. Terpstra V. Green S.R. Kondratenko N. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17551-17557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In both mice (21Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar) and rats (23Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), SR-BI expression occurs predominantly in tissues exhibiting high levels of HDL-CE-selective uptake, namely steroidogenic cells and the liver (9Glass C.

Edelman E.R. Seifert P. Iqbal S.N. DeMattos R.B. Temel R.E. Krieger M. Williams D.L. J. Biol.

Direct evidence for SR-BI function in steroidogenic cells is provided by recent results showing that antibody to the extracellular domain of SR-BI blocks HDL-CE-selective uptake and the delivery of HDL cholesterol to the steroidogenic pathway in cultured adrenocortical cells (27Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13600-13605Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, inactivation of the SR-BI gene by a targeted mutation in mice results in a dramatic reduction in neutral lipid stores in adrenal glands (28Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). These mice also show increased plasma levels of large CE-rich HDL particles. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SR-BI in the liver results in a marked reduction of HDL cholesterol in plasma and enhanced biliary secretion of cholesterol (29Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations provide strong evidence that SR-BI plays an important role in mediating HDL-CE-selective uptake in steroidogenic cells and the liver. Our goal was to define the molecular mechanisms of SR-BI-mediated HDL-CE-selective uptake. In order to achieve this, we examined the relationship between the binding of HDL, and the selective uptake of its CE in the Y1-BS1 cell; the quantitative data show a tight correlation among these parameters. The stoichiometry and temperature dependence of CE uptake from HDL and recombinant HDL particles of defined composition support a model in which HDL binding to SR-BI results in the formation of a non-aqueous pathway through which HDL-CE molecules move down their concentration gradient into the adrenocortical cell membrane. By obtaining novel quantitative data with the Y1-BS1 cell line with which Pittman and colleagues (9Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol.

These samples were dialyzed exhaustively against 150 mm NaCl, and the lipoprotein-deficient plasma containing cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity was heat-inactivated for 10 min at 60 °C to eliminate lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity (31Terpstra A.H. Nicolosi R.J. Herbert P.N. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1663-1671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, 5 mg of HDL3, 240 mg of lipoprotein-deficient plasma, 0.01% aprotinin, 0.01% glutathione, and 25–40 μCi of [3H]cholesteryl hexadecyl ether ([3H]CHE) (40–60 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) added in an ethanol carrier, were combined in a polypropylene tube sealed with N2 gas, and incubated for 40 h at 37 °C according to the method of Terpstra et al. (31Terpstra A.H. Nicolosi R.J. Herbert P.N. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1663-1671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the equilibration of [3H]CHE label into the neutral lipid core of HDL, HDL was re-isolated by adjusting the density of the mixture and collecting the d < 1.21 g/ml fraction following two sequential isolations after 24-h centrifugation cycles. Using this procedure, essentially all of the albumin present in the lipoprotein-deficient plasma fraction was eliminated from the re-isolated HDL. Radioiodination of the protein moiety of [3H]CHE-labeled HDL was performed by the iodine monochloride method as described by Goldstein et al. (13Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 mg of HDL protein was placed in a glass tube, the pH adjusted with glycine buffer (pH 10), then approximately 1 mCi of carrier-free Na125I (15–18 Ci/mg, NEN Life Science Products) and 10 μl of a 2.64 mm iodine monochloride solution was added to initiate the labeling process. After approximately 30 s, the mixture was passed through a 10-ml Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech PD-10) column equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (saline buffer), to separate radiolabeled material from free 125I. Thereafter, fractions corresponding to the radioiodinated HDL were pooled and exhaustively dialyzed overnight against saline buffer containing 97 mm potassium iodide, then with saline buffer without potassium iodide. Specific activities were 300–1000 dpm/ng of protein for 125I-labeled HDL and 5–25 dpm/ng of CE for [3H]CHE-HDL. Briefly, human apoA-I/phospholipid (PL) discoidal complexes were prepared by adding 5.5 mg of total lipid composed of 1-palmitoyl,2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC, +99% grade, Avanti Polar Lipids) and cholesteryl oleate taken from stock solutions in chloroform to a glass tube and mixing them so that an initial mole ratio of 99.5:0.5, 99.0:1.0, or 97:3 PL-to-CE was achieved. Thereafter, 40 μCi of [3H]CHE was added as a trace label to monitor CE transfer. This mixture of lipid and radiolabeled markers was dried into a film under a stream of nitrogen, then dried under vacuum. The lipid was subsequently hydrated in saline buffer, vortexed to generate multilamellar vesicles, and sodium cholate (4.2 mg from a 30 mg/ml solution in saline buffer) was added to generate mixed micelles; the mixture was then incubated at 37 °C with immersion for at least 30 min in a bath sonicator to clear the initially turbid solution. The PL vesicles and sodium cholate were then allowed to further react for the remainder of 1.5 h with vortex mixing every 15 min. Next, apoA-I in saline buffer was added to the detergent/lipid mixture at a mole ratio of 100:1 lipid-to-protein, which typically required 2 mg of apoA-I. The lipid/detergent/protein complexes were then aspirated into a syringe containing Bio-beads (Bio-Rad), and the solution was rotated for 3 h at 4 °C to facilitate the removal of cholate; the apoA-I/PL/CE discoidal complexes were then isolated by filtration of the contents of the syringe through a 0.45-μm sterile filter. The sizes of the reconstituted HDL particles (rHDL) generated were assessed by native gel polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (PAGGE) using a Phast System as described previously (32Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rodrigueza W.V. Williams K.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The [3H]CHE reconstituted HDL particles were radioiodinated as described above, and a homogenous population of particles was isolated following elution from a Superdex HR-200 (30 × 1 cm) column to remove any remaining vesicular structures and lipid-free apoA-I. Specific activities were typically 400–1000 dpm/ng of apoA-I and 3–4 dpm/ng of PL for recombinant HDL particles. Protein content was determined by a modified Lowry assay (34Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5307) Google Scholar), PL content was determined by the Bartlett assay, and unesterified cholesterol and CE were measured by gas-liquid chromatography, without and with prior saponification, as described (33Rodrigueza W.V. Williams K.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In some instances, particles were dual-labeled with [3H]CHE and [14C]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine ([14C]DPPC, 159 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) to track CE and PC uptake, respectively. The [14C]DPPC was radiolabeled in the methyl choline position. Preliminary experiments using particles dual-labeled with [3H]CHE and fatty acid-labeled [14C]DPPC revealed that 3–5% of the label was hydrolyzed into lysoPC and [14C]fatty acid after these particles were incubated with cells for 2 h. Because the percentage of cellular uptake of PL is about 1% (see “Results,” Tables I and II), this precluded the use of fatty acid-labeled [14C]PL tracers. In contrast, there was no detectable decomposition of [3H]CHE and [14C-methylcholine]DPPC following a 2-h cell incubation. To compare the relative rates of uptake of different classes of PL, POPC:cholesteryl oleate:apoAI (88:1:1 mol:mol) rHDL particles containing ≤1.5 mol% of the following [3H]- and [14C]PL tracers were prepared: [14C]DPPC and bovine [3H]phosphatidylinositol labeled in the inositol group (18 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); [14C]1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidylserine labeled in the serine group (54 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [3H]DPPC labeled in the choline group (85 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); bovine [14C]sphingomyelin labeled in the choline group (55 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [3H]DPPC. The purities of the PL radiolabels were checked by thin layer chromatography using silica gel plates and a chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water solvent system. Where necessary, preparative thin layer chromatography was used to isolate radiolabeled PL of > 99.9% purity. No detectable decomposition occurred after 2-h incubations of the rHDL particles with cells. In control experiments, the uptake of [14C]DPPC and [3H]DPPC was identical.Table IStoichiometry of phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl oleate uptake from discoidal rHDL particlesrHDL particleaThe molar composition of the rHDL particle was 88 POPC:1 cholesteryl oleate:0.5 [14C]DPPC:0.005 [3H]CHE:1.0 apoA-I, and the concentration of the particles in the extracellular medium was 30 μg of protein/ml.Total CE uptakebAll uptake values are expressed per mg of cell protein per 2 h.

The attachment strategies of marine organisms that rely on DOPA-containing 1The abbreviations DOPAdihydroxyphenylalanineREDORrotational-echo double resonance 1The abbreviations DOPAdihydroxyphenylalanineREDORrotational-echo double resonanceadhesive proteins have recently come under much scrutiny. A number of these organisms, including tube-building polychaetes, black corals, ascidians, and mussels, cure their proteinaceous adhesives by a process called “quinone tanning” (1Waite J.H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1990; 97B: 19-29Google Scholar). Despite frequent references toin vitro studies postulating that quinone tanning involves nucleophilic addition of amine groups to quinones (2Mason H.S. Adv. Enzymol. 1955; 16: 105-184PubMed Google Scholar), nothing of substance is known about the actual cross-linking chemistry in these organisms. Indeed, previous efforts from our own laboratories seemed to rule out the existence of lysine-aromatic or aromatic-aromatic coupling products in the mussel byssus (3Holl S.M. Hansen D.C. Waite J.H. Schaefer J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Klug C.A. Burzio L.A. Waite J.H. Schaefer J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In 1994, Dolmer and Svane (5Dolmer P. Svane I. Ophelia. 1994; 40: 63-74Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) reported that individual threads in a mussel byssus behaved as “smart materials” in flow: by doubling the flow of seawater, the tensile strength of the threads could be doubled. This suggested that there were different degrees of quinone-tanning in a given material that relied in some way on maturation by imposed stresses. dihydroxyphenylalanine rotational-echo double resonance dihydroxyphenylalanine rotational-echo double resonance This paper reports on the continuation of work on the biosynthetic labeling of byssus with 13C- and 2H-containing analogs of tyrosine and the in situ analysis of this label-rich material by rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) NMR (6Gullion T. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 81: 196-200Crossref Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). We have repeated the byssus labeling under high flow conditions and compared directly REDOR spectra of byssal plaques collected under stressed (flow) and unstressed (stationary or minimal flow) conditions. The difference between these REDOR spectra reveal the preferential routing of tyrosine labels to diphenolics. The13C{2H} REDOR dephasing is only consistent with the formation of 5, 5′-di-DOPA covalent cross-links stabilizing the byssal plaques formed under stress. 170 Adult mussels (Mytilus edulis) were collected in the vicinity of Roosevelt Inlet at Lewes, Delaware. The mussels ranged in size from 3 to 10 cm. They were tethered to acrylic plates as described previously (4Klug C.A. Burzio L.A. Waite J.H. Schaefer J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The plates were put into two 140-liter marine aquarium tanks with salt water (no flow) at 14 °C. The tanks were aerated. Labels (13C, 99 atom %; 2H, 98 atom %; Cambridge Isotopes) were added in equal amounts to each tank to make the following concentrations: 49.3 μml-[phenol-4-13C]tyrosine and 48.5 μml-[ring-2H4]tyrosine. The mussels were incubated with the labels for 48 h, after which control samples of plaques and threads were harvested. The plaque harvests used here derive from two mussel groups. The “unstressed” group was maintained in the 140-liter holding tank with essentially stationary flow (4Klug C.A. Burzio L.A. Waite J.H. Schaefer J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The “stressed” group was transferred to a flow tank which consisted of a water table that was inclined three degrees from level at one end with an unobstructed laminar flow of 20 cm/s. Low partitions (2–3 cm height) were inserted to allow for the formation of shallow pools in which mussels could be submerged. The water temperature was maintained at 16 °C. Threads and plaques from the stressed mussels were harvested on days 7, 10, 13, 17, 21, and 28. The average thread harvest was 150 mg, and the average plaque harvest was 60 mg. A loss of 13 mussels occurred during the course of the experiment. The same spectrometer was used as described before (4Klug C.A. Burzio L.A. Waite J.H. Schaefer J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) but with the performance of the 2H channel improved. The dephasing 2H π pulses were shortened to 6.6 μs from 7.1 μs, which increased the observed REDOR dephasing for the same mussel sample by about a factor of two. The relative incorporation of label as a function of time after the 2-day labeling period was similar to that reported earlier (4Klug C.A. Burzio L.A. Waite J.H. Schaefer J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Carbon- and deuterium-labeled rings are assumed to be equally probable. There is no scrambling of label. Threads and plaques harvested from 7–17 days after labeling were close to 20% 13C-enriched in tyrosyl residues. Based on a comparison of the intensity of the 155-ppm tyrosyl, oxygenated aromatic carbon peak relative to that of the 175-ppm natural abundance, carbonyl carbon peak (4Klug C.A. Burzio L.A. Waite J.H. Schaefer J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the isotopic enrichment for the unstressed mussel plaques is slightly higher than that of the stressed mussel plaque (Fig.1, left and right). Nevertheless, the 145-ppm diphenolic peak (4Klug C.A. Burzio L.A. Waite J.H. Schaefer J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 7Schaefer J. Kramer K.J. Garbow J.R. Jacob G.S Stejskal E.O. Hopkins T.L. Spiers R.D. Science. 1987; 235: 1200-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) of the stressed plaque is increased by 50% relative to the unstressed plaque (Fig. 1,bottom), suggesting creation of increased levels of DOPA. The 175-ppm REDOR difference at the top of Fig. 1 (left) shows 4% dephasing, which we assume arises from random placement of2H-labeled rings near peptide carbonyl carbons. (The dephasings of the α-carbon and aliphatic carbon regions at 50 and 20 ppm, respectively, appear to be somewhat less than 4%. It is conceivable that some of the tyrosyl aromatic carbon label has been transformed to quinone carbonyl carbons, with an expected chemical shift near 180 ppm, and that these carbons are near 2H labels in the covalently attached rings of diquinone or DOPA-quinone moieties. This possibility is under further examination.) The dephasing for the 155-ppm peak is about double the assumed 4% random placement value, which we interpret as indicating local ordering in the inherent positioning of labeled rings in tyrosyl- and DOPA-rich proteins. However, the REDOR dephasing for the increase in intensity of the 145-ppm diphenolic peak of stressed relative to unstressed byssal plaques is close to the 20% level of the isotopic enrichment itself (Fig. 2, ΔΔS/ΔS 0). This level of dephasing cannot be accounted for by the adventitious placements of13C- and 2H-labeled rings but requires the proximity of labels arising from a covalent linkage. Regardless of the relative orientation of the two rings of a 5,5′-di-DOPA cross-link (Fig. 3,inset), the 4-bond 13C-2H distance is between 2.8 and 4.2 Å. Within this distance range,13C{2H} dephasing is complete after 64 rotor cycles with magic-angle spinning at 5 kHz (Fig. 3). Moreover, the 6-bond, 6-Å separation of the distal 2H in 5,5′-di-DOPA will provide additional dephasing, which is possible because of the 1/3 probability of an m = 0 spin state for the proximal2H (8Schmidt A. McKay R.A. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 644-650Google Scholar). The combination of the two labels accounts for the observed 20% dephasing. This level of dephasing is not possible for other types of tyrosyl cross-links resulting in a 145-ppm diphenolic aromatic carbon, such as, for example, an isodityrosine linkage, which can have a 5-bond separation for its nearest neighbor13C-2H pair. This is the first successful detection of a covalent cross-link in mussel byssus, or for that matter, in any marine holdfast. It is noteworthy that other dicatechols, 6,6′-di-[1-methylcatechol], as well as related quinone derivatives, were enzymatically synthesized and characterized by Andersen et al. (9Andersen S.O. Jacobsen J.P. Bojesen G. Roepstorff P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1118: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) who wrote that such compounds “ … are preferentially produced when catechols are oxidized under conditions with excess water, rather high concentrations of catechols, and few other compounds available for reaction with intermediary o-quinones.” Whether this statement describes the microenvironments in which the peptidyl DOPA residues of byssal proteins function is not yet known. Based on spin counts for carbons at 145- and 175-ppm (Fig. 2), we estimate that the increase in cross-link density resulting from higher levels of flow stress is 1 di-DOPA cross-link per 1800 total protein amino acid residues. This estimate is an average for bulk byssal plaque material. Naturally, the cross-link density in specific DOPA proteins can be higher. Given that byssal plaques stressed with a flow of 20 cm/s contained enhanced levels of di-DOPA cross-links, it would be intriguing to determine whether yet higher flows lead to higher cross-link densities. Mussels can survive in flow regimes in excess of 15 m/s (10Bell E.C. Gosline J.M. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 1997; 159: 197-208Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We thank Barbara Poliks (SUNY, Binghamton) for calculation of the conformationally dependent distances in 5–5′-di-DOPA."

Calcium ion acts as a ubiquitous second messenger, especially in neural tissues where many of its physiological responses are mediated by the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM). 1The abbreviations CaMcalmodulinNOSnitric-oxide synthasenNOSiNOS, and eNOS, neuronal, inducible, and endothelial isoforms, respectively, of nitric-oxide synthasecNOSCa2+/CaM-dependent nitric-oxide synthasePVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCaM-K IαIIα, and IV, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases Iα, IIα, and IVCaM-KKcalcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinaseDCPIP2,6-dichlorophenolindophenolPKCprotein kinase CPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseGSTglutathioneS-transferaseBSAbovine serum albumin The actions of CaM are mediated by its association with specific target proteins, some of which are known as CaM-binding proteins, which include kinases such as CaM kinase I (CaM-K I), CaM kinase II (CaM-K II), and CaM kinase IV (CaM-K IV) (1Nairn A.C.

CaM also associates with flavoproteins such as the nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs), which catalyze the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and l-citrulline from l-arginine (3Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem.

The different NOS isoforms are involved in biological processes as diverse as neurotransmission (neuronal NOS (nNOS)), blood pressure homeostasis (endothelial NOS (eNOS)), and cytotoxicity (inducible NOS (iNOS)). These three NOS isoforms are the products of distinct genes located on different chromosomes and show distinct tissue-specific patterns of expression (7Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Biol.

It has been confirmed that not only cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) but also cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C (PKC), and CaM kinase can phosphorylate nNOS, although the physiological significance of this phosphorylation remains uncertain, as there is either no detectable effect on enzyme activity or else the effect is controversial (11Brune B.

More recently, it was determined that Ca2+/CaM-dependent NOSs (cNOSs) contain a unique polypeptide insertion, identified as amino acids 598–642 for bovine aortic endothelial cell eNOS and 831–872 for rat brain nNOS, which serves as a control element (15Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The insert peptide of nNOS contains three serine residues, which are potential sites for phosphorylation by CaM-K II. Since a synthetic peptide derived from the insertion of eNOS interferes with CaM binding to cNOSs, while a peptide derived from nNOS does not (15Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

Thus, we suspected that one of the three serine residues in this element of nNOS may be the phosphorylation site for CaM-K II. Here, we report that nNOS is phosphorylated at Ser847 by CaM kinases, including CaM-K Iα, CaM-K IIα, and CaM-K IV in vitro. The effects of phosphorylation at Ser847 on activation of the enzyme activity are also documented. Furthermore, we present evidence that CaM kinases phosphorylate nNOS at Ser847 in vivo. These findings demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism for nNOS in neural cells via Ser847 phosphorylation by CaM kinases. CaM-K Iα, CaM-K IIα, CaM-K IV, and CaM kinase kinase (CaM-KK) were obtained from a rat brain cDNA library. The cDNA for rat brain nNOS was a generous gift from Dr. Solomon H. Snyder (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). pGroESL, containing groEL and groES cDNAs, was from DuPont. pCWori+ was provided by Dr. Michael Waterman (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). l-[3H]Arginine, [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol), and ECL Western blotting detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from Takara Shuzo. Electrophoresis reagents and Bradford protein dye reagents were products of Bio-Rad. All other materials and reagents were of the highest quality available from commercial suppliers. The cDNA for an inactive mutant nNOS was generated by mutation of Lys732-Lys-Leu to Asp732-Asp-Glu, as described previously (16Watanabe Y. Hu Y. Hidaka H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). pCWnNOS, the plasmid for the expression of nNOS inEscherichia coli, was constructed as described preciously (17Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The EspI/XbaI fragment of the cDNA for nNOS was inserted into M13mp18 to produce single-stranded DNA for mutagenesis. Four different oligonucleotides (5′-AGGAGGAGACGGCGTTGAATCGGA-3′, 5′-AGGAGGAGACGTCGTTGAATCGG-3′, 5′-TCGGGAGTCGGCATAGGAGGA-3′, and 5′-TCCGTCGCCGGCTGACTTTCGGGA-3′) were synthesized to provide mutations of Ser847 to Ala, Ser847 to Asp, Ser852 to Ala, and Ser858 to Ala (underlined codons), respectively. Mutation was carried out using the SculputorTM in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mutant clones were isolated, and the presence of site-directed mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant cDNAs were ligated into pCWori+ to generate pCWnNOS S847A, S847D, S852A, and S858A. Wild-type or mutant pCWnNOSs and pGroESL were co-transformed into the protease-deficient E. coli strain BL21 (Stratagene). The CaM kinase Iα1–293 fragment was constructed by polymerase chain reaction from rat CaM kinase Iα with BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites. This fragment was subcloned into the pGEX-2T vector containing glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the fusion protein (GST/CaM kinase I α1–293) was expressed in E. coli (BL21 cells, Stratagene) and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (18Yokokura H.

Recombinant wild-type and mutants rat nNOSs were expressed in E. coli or Sf9 cells and purified by 2′-5′-ADP-agarose (Sigma), as described previously (17Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14723-14732Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat CaM-K Iα, CaM-K IIα, and CaM-K IV were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by CaM-Sepharose chromatography. Recombinant CaM-KK was expressed inE. coli and purified by CaM-Sepharose chromatography. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford using BSA as the standard (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Recombinant CaM-K Iα and CaM-K IV (1 μm each) were preincubated with recombinant CaM-KK (350 nm) at 30 °C for 10 min in 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 μmCaM, 100 μm ATP, and 100 μg/ml BSA before phosphorylation of nNOS. The standard assay conditions were 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 μm CaM, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, 53 μg/ml nNOS, and 100 nm CaM kinases at 30 °C in a final volume of 30 μl. The final concentrations of protein kinases were 6.8, 4, and 6.6 μg/ml for activated CaM-K Iα, CaM-K IIα, and activated CaM-K IV, respectively. Reactions were stopped by the addition of sample buffer, followed by electrophoresis on 6–12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Quantitation of 32P incorporation into nNOS was achieved by cutting out the appropriate gel pieces and determining their radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. NOS activity was determined by measuring the conversion of l-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline as described previously (17Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,19Richards M.K. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14723-14732Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, incubation was performed for 2 min at 25 °C (E. coli-expressed enzyme) or 3 min at 30 °C (Sf9 cell-expressed enzyme) (over which time the reaction was linear) in 50 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 30 nm (E. coli-expressed enzyme) or 100 nm (Sf9 cell-expressed enzyme) NOS, 1 μm CaM, 100 μml-[3H]arginine, 0.1 mm NADPH, 20 μm BH4, 4 μm FAD, and 4 μm FMN. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 1 mml-citrulline, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mmEGTA, and then the mixture was passed through a column of AG 50W-X8 resin (Bio-Rad). The eluted [3H]citrulline was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. nNOS-catalyzed reduction of cytochrome c and DCPIP was determined photometrically in 0.2 ml of a 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mm NADPH, 4 μm FAD, 4 μm FMN, and 30 nm nNOS either in the presence (cytochrome c) or absence (DCPIP) of Ca2+/CaM. The concentrations of the electron acceptors in the incubations were 100 μm, and the initial rates of their reduction were calculated using the following extinction coefficients, given as mm−1 × cm−1: cytochromec, 21 at 550 nm; and DCPIP, 20.6 at 600 nm, respectively. Wild-type and mutant nNOS proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membranes as described by Towbin et al. (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% nonfat milk, and 0.05% Tween 20 in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at room temperature. Biotinylated CaM was then added at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml in the same buffer for 1 h. After washing with the buffer, membranes were incubated with avidin-biotin-peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Inc.), washed extensively, and then developed with the chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant nNOS (0.5 μg) expressed in E. coli was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm ATP. The final concentrations of PKA and PKC were 100 nm, respectively. For phosphorylation by PKC, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine and 1 mm CaCl2 were added. Reactions were stopped by the addition of sample buffer followed by 6% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membranes. For immunodetection of the transferred proteins, the procedure of Burnette (23Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar) was used, except that the second antibody was linked to horseradish peroxidase. We developed antibody recognizing the phosphorylation at Ser847 on nNOS as described previously (24Nishizawa K. Yano T. Shibata M. Ando S. Saga S. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3074-3079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of the phosphorylated synthetic peptide, CKVRfnS(phosphoS)VSSYS, coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, emulsified in Freund‘s complete adjuvant, was injected into a rabbit subcutaneously. Every 2 weeks, the same portion of the antigen solution emulsified in Freund‘s incomplete adjuvant was boosted. The rabbit was bled 5 weeks after the initial injection. Immunoglobulin G was affinity-purified by tandem column chromatography using columns coupled to phosphorylated synthetic peptide and non-phosphorylated synthetic peptide, CKVRfnSSVSSYS. We first determined whether CaM kinases could phosphorylate recombinant nNOS expressed in the E. coli system and found that nNOS was phosphorylated by these kinases in the presence of Ca2+/CaM in vitro (Fig. 1). CaM-K IIα caused the most rapid phosphorylation with half-maximal phosphorylation apparent at 3 min and a plateau level at 10 min. CaM-K Iα and CaM-K IV activated by CaM-KK also phosphorylated nNOS, but the plateau level was not reached until 100 min (∼0.4 and ∼0.7 mol of32P/mol of nNOS at 100 min, respectively). nNOS phosphorylation was not observed if Ca2+/CaM or the CaM kinase was omitted from the reaction mixture and CaM-KK (140 nm) could not phosphorylate nNOS (data not shown). The maximal phosphorylation of nNOS by CaM-K IIα was observed at ∼0.4 mol of 32P/mol of nNOS under the conditions employed. To clarify whether the phosphorylation sites of the CaM kinases were the same, nNOS was sequentially phosphorylated by each of the two kinases. nNOS was initially phosphorylated by CaM-K IIα for 30 min and was then exposed to activated CaM-K IV or CaM-K Iα for an additional 30 min. No significant additional phosphate was incorporated into nNOS by addition of activated CaM-K IV or CaM-K Iα (data not shown), indicating that CaM-K IIα, CaM-K IV, and CaM-K Iα phosphorylated the same amino acid residue of nNOS. In order to determine whether Ca2+/CaM binding to CaM kinases, nNOS, or both, was essential for the phosphorylation reaction, we needed a substrate of CaM kinases that did not bind Ca2+/CaM. We have previously shown that mutation to Glu or Asp of several residues (Lys732-Lys-Leu) of nNOS blocks the binding of CaM and activation of nNOS. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether inactive nNOS lacking CaM binding ability, generated with mutation of Lys732-Lys-Leu to Asp732-Asp-Glu could be phosphorylated by CaM kinases. As shown in Fig. 2, mutant nNOS could be phosphorylated by CaM kinases like the wild-type enzyme in the presence of Ca2+/CaM. We also constructed a fusion protein of GST and a fragment of CaM kinase Iα (residues 1–293) (GST/CaM kinase I α1–293), which did not contain the autoinhibitory domain or the CaM-binding domain (18Yokokura H. Picciotto M.R. Nairn A.C. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23851-23859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). GST/CaM kinase I α1–293 phosphorylated wild-type nNOS either in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the binding of Ca2+/CaM to nNOS was not required for the phosphorylation of nNOS by CaM kinases. Analysis of a series of truncated mutants of nNOS suggested that the residues phosphorylated by CaM kinases are included within residues 825–884 (data not shown). It is known that CaM kinase II recognizes site that have an Arg located three residues toward the NH2 terminus of the phosphorylated Ser or Thr. Since phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that all three CaM kinases phosphorylated nNOS at amino acids that co-migrated with phosphoserine (data not shown), we made single mutants by introducing Ala residues in place of Ser847(S847A) and Ser858 (S858A), which were at the P-0 positions on the COOH-terminal sides of Arg844 and Arg855, respectively. We also wanted to place a Ser at three residues toward the NH2 terminus of Arg855 (S852A), because the orientation of the consensus phosphorylation sequence for CaM-K II (25Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may be opposite to that of the normal substrate. Wild-type and single mutants were expressed using the E. coli or the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system and purified on 2′-5′-ADP-agarose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All of the recombinant nNOSs were at least 90% pure and gave a major band at 160 kDa on SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 3 A). Mutants S852A and S858A were phosphorylated by CaM kinases as was the wild-type enzyme, but the S847A mutant was not phosphorylated by activated CaM-K Iα or CaM-K IV. In contrast, CaM-K IIα did phosphorylate this mutant, but only very slightly (Fig. 3 B). The above results demonstrated that Ser847 was a major phosphorylation site for CaM kinases. Mutant S847D was also constructed and expressed in theE. coli system (Fig. 3 A). We tested the ability of Ser847 residue phosphorylation to affect NOS enzyme activity using the mutant S847D. Enzyme activity was determined from the rate of conversion of l-arginine tol-citrulline. The mutant S847D exhibited NOS enzyme activity that was approximately 40% of the wild-type level in the presence of Ca2+/CaM (Fig.4 A). Since pretreatment of the nNOS preparation from E. coli caused instability of NOS enzyme activity (data not shown), wild-type nNOS was also expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system (Fig. 3 A). Most properties of the purified overexpressed enzyme were identical to those previously reported, including the specific activity (195 nmol/min/mg) (19Richards M.K. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14723-14732Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, preincubation of Ca2+/CaM with nNOS from the Sf9 cells for 10 min markedly attenuated NOS enzyme activity to less than 10% of that without preincubation, and we did not detect any changes in NOS activity following in vitro phosphorylation by CaM kinases in the presence of Ca2+/CaM (data not shown). We employed a constitutive active form of CaM-K Iα (GST/CaM kinase I α1–293) for phosphorylating nNOS. Wild-type nNOS was incubated either with (≈0.5 mol of phosphate incorporation into nNOS) or without activated GST/CaM kinase I α1–293 at 30 °C with 100 μm ATP in the presence of EGTA, and NOS activity was determined from the rate of conversion of l-arginine tol-citrulline. The preincubation under the conditions employed also attenuated NOS enzyme activity to approximately 50% (85.8 ± 1.7 nmol/min/mg) of that without incubation. However, phosphorylated nNOS exhibited NOS enzyme activity that was approximately 70% compared with unphosphorylated enzyme (Fig.4 B). Neither mutant S847D nor nNOS exhibited Ca2+/CaM-independent NOS activity. All NOS isoforms are known to catalyze electron transfer to a variety of artificial electron acceptors (26McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 27Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J.

Phosphorylated nNOS exhibited CaM-dependent reduction of cytochrome c that was approximately 65% compared with unphosphorylated enzyme. Meanwhile, CaM-independent DCPIP reduction of phosphorylated nNOS was essentially indistinguishable from that of the unphosphorylated enzyme (TableI). Interestingly, the reductase activities of preincubated nNOS was similar to that of the enzyme without incubation (data not shown). Thus, Ser847 in nNOS appears to represent an essential determinant for transducing the nNOS-CaM interaction into stimulation of enzyme activity via its phosphorylation.Table IReductase activities of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated nNOSsProteinElectron acceptorCytochrome cDCPIPμmol/min/mgUnphosphorylated nNOS9.66 ± 0.15.60 ± 0.5Phosphorylated nNOS6.25 ± 0.15.55 ± 0.2nNOS-catalyzed reduction of cytochrome c and DCPIP was determined photometrically in buffer containing 0.1 mmNADPH, 4 μm FAD, 4 μm FMN, and 30 nm nNOS either in the presence (cytochrome c) or absence (DCPIP) of Ca2+/CaM as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The means ± S.E. of two or three experiments is shown.

It was important to determine how the phosphorylation at Ser847 altered the kinetics of nNOS. TableII summarizes some of the properties of the phosphorylated nNOS compared with the unphosphorylated enzyme. From the results shown, it is clear that the main effect of the phosphorylation at Ser847 was to lower theV max of NOS activity, with little change of theK m for l-arginine andK act for CaM. We also analyzed the kinetics of the mutant S847D and wild-type enzyme. Mutation of Ser847to Asp resulted in attenuation of the specific activity (V max) (304 ± 24.5 versus158.5 ± 18.5 nmol/min/mg), with little change of theK m for l-arginine andK act for CaM.Table IIKinetic properties of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated nNOSUnphosphorylatedPhosphorylatedK ml-arginine (μm)10.6 ± 0.611.6 ± 0.6K act CaM (nm)92.7 ± 0.596.6 ± 0.1NOS activityV max(nmol/min/mg)95.7 ± 4.271.8 ± 2.4Minus FAD (20 μm)100%100%Minus FMN (20 μm)100%100%Minus BH4 (100 μm)67%71%NOS enzyme activity was determined by the rate of conversion ofl-arginine to l-citrulline as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the mean ± S.E. for two or three experiments.

Open table in a new tab NOS enzyme activity was determined by the rate of conversion ofl-arginine to l-citrulline as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the mean ± S.E. for two or three experiments. K m andV max values were determined from double-reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk) of data obtained from experiments performed with four concentrations (3–100 μm) ofl-arginine. K act value was determined three concentrations (60–330 nm) of CaM. In order to understand how CaM kinases regulate nNOS, the CaM-binding ability of the mutants was analyzed. The CaM binding of mutant S847D or phosphorylated nNOS was significantly decreased compared with that of wild-type or unphosphorylated enzyme, respectively, as assessed by the gel overlay technique (Fig. 5). Previous characterization of NOS has indicated that the native protein is a homodimer, and dimerization has been shown to be necessary for catalytic activity of the enzyme. We therefore explored the possibility that the mutated or phosphorylated residue (Ser847) affected the dimerization of nNOS. It is known that the nNOS homodimer is stabilized by tetrahydrobiopterin and l-arginine during low temperature SDS-PAGE. In this assay, the dimerization of mutant S847D or phosphorylated nNOS was essentially indistinguishable from that of the wild-type or unphosphorylated enzyme, respectively (data not shown). These findings suggest that Ser847 residue influenced the interaction between CaM and nNOS via its phosphorylation. Identification of the in vivo phosphorylation at Ser847 on nNOS- nNOS is phosphorylated on different serine site of the enzyme by PKA, PKC, and CaM-K II in vitro (13Bredt D.S. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm in vivo phosphorylation at Ser847 on nNOS, we used a phosphospecific antibody, NP847. This antibody was specific for Ser(P)847 in nNOS, reacting with phosphorylated nNOS by CaM-K IIα but not with that by PKA or PKC (Fig. 6 A). Protein immunoblot analyses with NP847 of a partially purified rat brain nNOS detected an immunoreactive band corresponding to the 160-kDa nNOS (Fig.6 B). These data demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser847 on nNOS is catalyzed not only in vitrobut also in vivo. Although it has already been confirmed that nNOS is phosphorylated by several protein kinases, such as PKA, PKC, and CaM kinase, the easy thermal denaturation and inactivation of NOS has limited our understanding of the activation mechanisms mediated via phosphorylation. By using truncated and site-directed nNOS mutants, we identified the amino acid residue phosphorylated by CaM kinases and found that this phosphorylation caused a decrease in NOS enzyme activity. We also employed a constitutive active form of CaM-K Iα for phosphorylating nNOS, followed by analysis of the phosphorylated enzyme. This finding is consistent with the results of previousin vitro studies demonstrating a dramatic attenuation of nNOS enzyme activity following CaM-K II phosphorylation (12Nakane M. Mitchell J. Forstermann U. Murad F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Such down-regulation of nNOS activity by CaM kinases may represent an important component of the “cross-talk” between kinases and NO. All three tested CaM kinases incorporated 0.4–0.7 mol of32P/mol of recombinant nNOS expressed in E. coli, in good agreement with the results using purified rat brain nNOS (13Bredt D.S. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nakane et al. reported that 9 mol of32P/mol of purified rat brain nNOS were incorporated by CaM-K II (12Nakane M. Mitchell J. Forstermann U. Murad F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We also analyzed the 32P stoichiometry using partially purified rat brain nNOS as a control experiment, which was similar to the results using recombinant nNOS expressed in E. coli under the conditions employed (data not shown)."
https://openalex.org/W1998456589,"The ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) is the major representative of the inner membrane carrier proteins of mitochondria that are synthesized without cleavable presequences. The characterization of the import pathway of AAC into mitochondria has mainly depended on an operational staging system. Here, we introduce two approaches for analyzing the import of AAC, blue native electrophoresis and folding-induced translocation arrest, that allow a functional staging of AAC transport across the outer membrane. (i) Blue native electrophoresis permits a direct monitoring of the receptor stage of AAC and its chase into mitochondria. Binding to this stage requires the receptor protein Tom70 but not Tom37 or Tom20. (ii) A fusion protein between AAC and dihydrofolate reductase can be selectively arrested in the general import pore complex of the outer membrane by ligand induced folding of the passenger protein. Cross-linking demonstrates that the arrested preprotein is in close contact not only with several receptors and Tim10 but also with the channel protein Tom40, providing the first direct evidence that cleavable preproteins and carrier preproteins interact with the same outer membrane channel. The staging system presented here permits a molecular dissection of AAC transport across the outer mitochondrial membrane, relates it to functional units of the translocases, and indicates a coordinated and successive cooperation of distinct translocase subcomplexes during transfer of the preprotein."

Magnesium is the most abundant divalent cation within living cells, and it serves as an essential cofactor in innumerable enzymatic reactions. It has equally important roles in maintaining tertiary structures of proteins and RNAs, and it plays an important role in the catalysis of ribozymes and in RNA splicing (1Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A.

In eukaryotic cells magnesium concentrations are in the lower millimolar range and they are relatively constant when extracellular concentrations are altered dramatically. Polyphosphate, RNA, and ATP bind most of the intracellular magnesium, leaving only a small fraction as free, ionized Mg2+. This pool of the free ion is presumed to enter biochemical processes and to be the transported form of magnesium (4Quamme G.A.

Although many observations indicate that transport systems for magnesium do exist, molecular studies on transporters are still scarce.CorA, an integral protein of the bacterial plasma membrane, has been shown to be the constitutive magnesium transporter in prokaryotes, mediating both uptake and efflux (9Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae three putative homologues of the CorA protein have been noticed recently. Functional studies of yeast overexpressing or lacking one of these genes, named ALR1, are consistent with a role in the transport of magnesium and cobalt through the yeast plasma membrane (11MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Here we present a detailed study on the location and possible function of the Mrs2 protein which is another putative homologue of the CorA family in S. cerevisiae. The nuclear MRS2 gene had been isolated in a search for suppressors of mitochondrial defects and was shown to play a role in RNA splicing and other functions in mitochondria (12Wiesenberger G. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6963-6969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data reveal that Mrs2p is inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane, putatively via two membrane spanning domains, and exposes large parts to the matrix space. Like the putative cytoplasmic transporter Alr1p in yeast (11MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial Mrs2 protein has weak similarity to the bacterial CorA protein family of magnesium ion transporters (9Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Partial suppression of thepetite phenotype of a mrs2 disruption mutant by the overproduction of the CorA protein in yeast suggests that CorA and Mrs2 proteins may be functionally related. This notion is supported by our finding of decreased or increased magnesium contents of mitochondria in strains lacking or overproducing Mrs2p, respectively.DISCUSSIONThe MRS2 gene product is unique among the factors supporting RNA-catalyzed splicing in that its presence is essential for the splicing of all four group II introns in yeast mitochondria, with and without intron-encoded maturases (12Wiesenberger G. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6963-6969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we characterize Mrs2p as an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Structural and functional similarity to the bacterial magnesium ion transporter CorA as well as measurements of ion concentrations in mitochondrial extracts indicate that Mrs2p is involved in mitochondrial metal ion homeostasis. These findings open new routes toward a better understanding of the role of metal ions in mitochondria.Mrs2p co-purifies with proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and it is resistant to extraction by alkaline carbonate, just like other integral proteins of this membrane. Treatment of mitoplasts with proteinase K does not change the apparent electrophoretic mobility of Mrs2p nor does it degrade a hemagglutinin epitope tag added to the carboxyl terminus of Mrs2p. The data presented here indicate that Mrs2p is inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane, putatively via two transmembrane domains, and that both hydrophilic ends are oriented toward the matrix side.Similarity between proteins of the Mrs2 family and the bacterial magnesium ion transporter CorA, although essentially restricted to the presence of two predicted membrane spanning domains in their carboxyl termini, a short sequence motif in one of them and charge distributions (cf. Fig. 3), hints at a possible function of Mrs2p in mitochondrial metal ion homeostasis. The yeast homologues Alr1p and Alr2p, putative components of the magnesium ion transport system in the plasma membrane, and a related protein, Mnr2 (11MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), are the only yeast proteins in the data banks that also exhibit these similarities to CorA,2 indicating that they may be typical for a highly diverged family of metal ion transporters.Strong support for a function of Mrs2p in mitochondrial metal ion homeostasis comes from our observation that the petphenotype of a yeast strain lacking Mrs2p is suppressed by the CorA protein when it is efficiently expressed in yeast and targeted to mitochondrial membranes. Apparently, the bacterial magnesium ion transporter can either substitute for Mrs2p or otherwise compensate for the absence of the yeast protein. The fact that its expression partially overcomes the group II intron splicing defect is in favor of a true substitution of Mrs2p by the CorA protein.Homologous functions of Mrs2 and CorA proteins are further suggested by the effects which their overexpression or mutation have in bacteria and in yeast. First, their absence increases the dependence of cells on high Mg2+ concentrations in growth media, although only when mrs2 or CorA mutants are combined with other mutations affecting uptake of this ion (see Refs. 9Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 10Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar and this work). The dependence of mrs2 mutants on high Mg2+ concentrations is particularly pronounced on non-fermentable substrate, suggesting a function of Mrs2p in mitochondrial Mg2+ homeostasis. Second, their expression from multi-copy plasmids selectively decreases tolerance to the toxic metal ions Co2+ and Ni2+, whereas disruption of the MRS2 gene or mutation of the CorA gene leads to increased tolerance of cellular growth to these ions (9Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).2 Co2+ and Ni2+ are likely to be taken up by the magnesium ion transporters CorA and Alr1 (9Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A role of Mrs2p in mitochondrial magnesium homeostasis finally is suggested by our finding of changes in mitochondrial total magnesium concentrations which increases with overexpression of Mrs2p and decreases upon disruption of the MRS2 gene. The CorA protein, expressed in yeast and targeted to the mitochondria, compensates for the absence of Mrs2p in that it restores wild-type levels of mitochondrial magnesium.A transport or regulatory function of the MRS2 gene product in mitochondrial Mg2+ homeostasis is consistent with our previous findings on its effects on group II intron RNA splicing (12Wiesenberger G. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6963-6969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); Mg2+ plays a prominent role in both the formation of tertiary structures and in the catalytic reactions of ribozymes (1Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 2Pyle A.M. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1996; 32: 479-520PubMed Google Scholar). The observed block of group II intron RNA splicing inmrs2-1Δ mutant cells of strain DBY747 (12Wiesenberger G. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6963-6969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may be explained by the observed reduction in mitochondrial Mg2+concentrations, whereas suppression of the splicing defect of an intron mutation (mit − M1301) (12Wiesenberger G. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6963-6969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Koll H. Schmidt C. Wiesenberger G. Schmelzer C. Curr. Genet. 1987; 12: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) could be due to the observed increase in mitochondrial magnesium concentration which results from overproduction of Mrs2p. This notion is supported by our observations that high Mg2+ concentrations in the medium enhance this suppression in vivo (not shown) and partially restore self-splicing of M1301 mutant RNA in vitro. 2 Moreover, the absence of Mrs2p is compensated for by Mrs3p, Mrs4p, or Mrs12p, three members of the mitochondrial carrier family, and we have speculated previously that they may be involved in the transport of cations (14Wiesenberger G.

Link T.A. von Ahsen U. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Van Dyck E. Jank B. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J. Duyckaerts C. Sluse F. Foury F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The MRS2 gene product is unique among the factors supporting RNA-catalyzed splicing in that its presence is essential for the splicing of all four group II introns in yeast mitochondria, with and without intron-encoded maturases (12Wiesenberger G. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6963-6969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we characterize Mrs2p as an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Structural and functional similarity to the bacterial magnesium ion transporter CorA as well as measurements of ion concentrations in mitochondrial extracts indicate that Mrs2p is involved in mitochondrial metal ion homeostasis. These findings open new routes toward a better understanding of the role of metal ions in mitochondria. Mrs2p co-purifies with proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and it is resistant to extraction by alkaline carbonate, just like other integral proteins of this membrane. Treatment of mitoplasts with proteinase K does not change the apparent electrophoretic mobility of Mrs2p nor does it degrade a hemagglutinin epitope tag added to the carboxyl terminus of Mrs2p. The data presented here indicate that Mrs2p is inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane, putatively via two transmembrane domains, and that both hydrophilic ends are oriented toward the matrix side. Similarity between proteins of the Mrs2 family and the bacterial magnesium ion transporter CorA, although essentially restricted to the presence of two predicted membrane spanning domains in their carboxyl termini, a short sequence motif in one of them and charge distributions (cf. Fig. 3), hints at a possible function of Mrs2p in mitochondrial metal ion homeostasis. The yeast homologues Alr1p and Alr2p, putative components of the magnesium ion transport system in the plasma membrane, and a related protein, Mnr2 (11MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), are the only yeast proteins in the data banks that also exhibit these similarities to CorA,2 indicating that they may be typical for a highly diverged family of metal ion transporters. Strong support for a function of Mrs2p in mitochondrial metal ion homeostasis comes from our observation that the petphenotype of a yeast strain lacking Mrs2p is suppressed by the CorA protein when it is efficiently expressed in yeast and targeted to mitochondrial membranes. Apparently, the bacterial magnesium ion transporter can either substitute for Mrs2p or otherwise compensate for the absence of the yeast protein. The fact that its expression partially overcomes the group II intron splicing defect is in favor of a true substitution of Mrs2p by the CorA protein. Homologous functions of Mrs2 and CorA proteins are further suggested by the effects which their overexpression or mutation have in bacteria and in yeast. First, their absence increases the dependence of cells on high Mg2+ concentrations in growth media, although only when mrs2 or CorA mutants are combined with other mutations affecting uptake of this ion (see Refs. 9Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 10Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar and this work). The dependence of mrs2 mutants on high Mg2+ concentrations is particularly pronounced on non-fermentable substrate, suggesting a function of Mrs2p in mitochondrial Mg2+ homeostasis. Second, their expression from multi-copy plasmids selectively decreases tolerance to the toxic metal ions Co2+ and Ni2+, whereas disruption of the MRS2 gene or mutation of the CorA gene leads to increased tolerance of cellular growth to these ions (9Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).2 Co2+ and Ni2+ are likely to be taken up by the magnesium ion transporters CorA and Alr1 (9Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A role of Mrs2p in mitochondrial magnesium homeostasis finally is suggested by our finding of changes in mitochondrial total magnesium concentrations which increases with overexpression of Mrs2p and decreases upon disruption of the MRS2 gene. The CorA protein, expressed in yeast and targeted to the mitochondria, compensates for the absence of Mrs2p in that it restores wild-type levels of mitochondrial magnesium. A transport or regulatory function of the MRS2 gene product in mitochondrial Mg2+ homeostasis is consistent with our previous findings on its effects on group II intron RNA splicing (12Wiesenberger G. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6963-6969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); Mg2+ plays a prominent role in both the formation of tertiary structures and in the catalytic reactions of ribozymes (1Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 2Pyle A.M. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1996; 32: 479-520PubMed Google Scholar). The observed block of group II intron RNA splicing inmrs2-1Δ mutant cells of strain DBY747 (12Wiesenberger G. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6963-6969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may be explained by the observed reduction in mitochondrial Mg2+concentrations, whereas suppression of the splicing defect of an intron mutation (mit − M1301) (12Wiesenberger G.

Such base unpairing regions (BURs) are typically found in scaffold or matrix attachment regions (SARs/MARs) that are thought to contribute to the formation of the loop domain structure of chromatin. Several proteins, including cell type-specific proteins, have been identified that bind specifically to double-stranded BURs either in vitro or in vivo. By using BUR-affinity chromatography to isolate BUR-binding proteins from breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells, we almost exclusively obtained a complex of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Both PARP and DNA-PK are activated by DNA strand breaks and are implicated in DNA repair, recombination, DNA replication, and transcription. In contrast to the previous notion that PARP and Ku autoantigen, the DNA-binding subunit of DNA-PK, mainly bind to free ends of DNA, here we show that both proteins individually bind BURs with high affinity and specificity in an end-independent manner using closed circular BUR-containing DNA substrates. We further demonstrate that PARP and Ku autoantigen form a molecular complexin vivo and in vitro in the absence of DNA, and as a functional consequence, their affinity to the BURs are synergistically enhanced.

Laemmli U.K. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 16-22Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In recent years, the biological significance of MARs is emerging (2Bode J. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L. Joh T. Klehr D. Mielke C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Science. 1992; 255: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In particular, studies on MARs flanking the immunoglobulin μ heavy chain (IgH) enhancer showed that these sequences are essential for the B lymphocyte-specific transcription of a rearranged μ gene (3Forrester W.C. van Genderen C. Jenuwein T. Grosschedl R. Science. 1994; 265: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These MARs have also been shown to be required for extending the domain of chromatin that is accessible to transcription factors and also confer factor access to enhancer-distal positions. The IgH MARs together with the μ enhancer can also induce, in a transcription-independent manner, extensive demethylation across the chromatin domain harboring these elements (4Jenuwein T. Forrester W.C. Fernández-Herrero L.A. Laible G. Dull M. Grosschedl R. Nature. 1997; 380: 269-272Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Additionally, MARs flanking the immunoglobulin κ enhancer have been shown to be necessary for B cell-specific demethylation of the κ locus (5Kirillov A. Kistler B. Mostoslasky R. Cedar H. Wirth T. Bergman Y. Nat. Genet. 1997; 13: 435-441Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that various genomic segments containing MARs are often found at the boundaries of transcription units and near regulatory elements such as enhancers (see Refs. 6Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 7Cockerill P.N. Yuen M.-H. Garrard W.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 15: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suggesting that the loop domains of chromatin formed by the attachment of MARs to nuclear matrix may define units of genetic function (reviewed in Ref. 1Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 16-22Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent studies have linked MARs to replication as certain MARs colocalize with origins of replication (10Largarkova M.A. Svetlova E. Giacca M. Falaschi A. Razin S.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the choice of the replication origin within the amplified dihydrofolate reductase domain may be dictated by the alteration in the local chromatin structure mediated by attachment of DNA to the nuclear matrix (11Pemov A. Bavykin S. Hamlin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The yeast H4 autonomous replication sequence contains a DNA sequence element with high unwinding potential and is located adjacent to the core replication sequence. This unwinding element is essential for initiation of replication at the H4 origin (12Umek R.M. Kowalski D. Cell. 1988; 52: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In various MARs, there exist base unpairing regions (BURs) of less than 150 bp that readily unwind by continuous base unpairing under negative torsional stress (2Bode J. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L. Joh T. Klehr D. Mielke C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Science. 1992; 255: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 13Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mutating the core unwinding element so as to abolish its unwinding ability greatly reduces binding to the nuclear matrix (2Bode J. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L. Joh T. Klehr D. Mielke C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Science. 1992; 255: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). BURs are binding targets of cell type-specific proteins such as the T cell factor SATB1 (14Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) and the B cell factor Bright (15Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Sceurmann R. Tucker P.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The T cell factor SATB1 binds in vivo to specialized genomic sequences located at the bases of chromatin loop domains which are tightly anchored onto the nuclear matrix (16de Belle I. Cai S. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and is essential for proper T cell development. 2J. D. Alvarez, D. H. Yasui, H. Niida, T. Joh, D. Y.

The BUR binding activity of this protein, called p114, correlated with progression of breast tumorigenesis (17Yanagisawa J. Ando J. Nakayama J. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 457-462PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we used BUR affinity chromatography and obtained, almost exclusively, a mixture of PARP and DNA-PK from the breast cancer cell line, SK-BR-3. PARP has been implicated in DNA repair in response to DNA damage (18Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), whereas DNA-PK has been proposed to function in a variety of nuclear processes including V(D)J recombination, double-stranded break (DSB) repair, DNA replication, and transcription (19Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 412-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). PARP and Ku autoantigen, the DNA-binding subunit of DNA-PK, are mainly known as proteins that bind to single- and double-stranded DNA ends, respectively (18Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 19Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 412-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, we show that either PARP alone or the p70 and p86 subunits of Ku autoantigen as a heterodimeric complex specifically bind with high affinity to IgH MARs recognizing internal sequences. We also show that PARP and the Ku70/86 directly interact and form a protein complex and, as a consequence, synergistically enhance their highly specific binding to these MARs. Human breast adenocarcinoma cell line SK-BR-3 (ATCC) was used for the studies described here. The cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals) and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). BUR affinity columns were prepared by coupling either a 24-bp mutated BUR-containing duplex oligonucleotide (upper strand, 5′-TCTTTAATTTCTACTGCTTTAGAAttc-3′) or a 25-bp wild type BUR-containing duplex oligonucleotide (upper strand, 5′-TCTTTAATTTCTAATATATTTAGAAttc-3′), ligated to an average length of 25, to freshly prepared CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 200 μg/ml bed volume as described (20Kohwi-Shigematsu T. deBelle I. Dickinson L.A. Galande S. Kohwi Y. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 323-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The differences between the wild type and mutated BUR-containing oligonucleotides are underlined. The affinity matrices were equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Nuclear extract from 5 × 108SK-BR-3 cells was prepared as described previously (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) and is referred to as the “0.4 m NaCl extract.” This extract was diluted with equilibration buffer to reduce the salt concentration to 0.2 m. The diluted extract (final volume 15 ml) was mixed with 10 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA and directly loaded onto a MUT MAR column (0.5 × 4 cm). The flow-through of the MUT MAR column was loaded onto WT MAR column (0.5 × 4 cm), washed first with equilibration buffer, and then the same buffer containing 0.3m KCl. Bound proteins were then eluted in a stepwise manner with buffers containing increasing amounts of KCl. Four 0.5-ml fractions were collected for each concentration of KCl used. The fractions containing most of the eluted protein (0.4–0.8m) were combined, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and loaded onto single-stranded DNA cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (0.5 ml) equilibrated in same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a step gradient of NaCl up to 1 m. Proteins were estimated using QUANTIGOLD reagent (Diversified Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using standard procedures, and the proteins were visualized by staining with Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad). The identity of BUR affinity column purified p70 was obtained by analyzing the high pressure liquid chromatography-purified peptides derived from the tryptic digest of SDS-polyacrylamide gel-purified p70 using an Applied Biosystems 470 peptide sequencer. The N-terminal sequence of p70 tryptic peptides was LYRETNEP and ELVYPPDYN, identical to amino acids 288–295 and 527–535 of human Ku-70, respectively (22Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and protein transfer to PVDF membranes (Millipore) was performed essentially as described (17Yanagisawa J. Ando J. Nakayama J. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 457-462PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific sites on the membrane were blocked by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma) in TST (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). The blots were then incubated with either anti-PARP (1:2500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody H-250 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or anti-Ku70 and anti-Ku86 (1:750 dilution of monoclonal antibody clones N3H10 and 111, respectively, from NeoMarkers). The blots were then incubated with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution in TST) and detected by using SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). The quantitation of signals was performed by densitometric analysis of the x-ray films using Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI and ImageQuant (version 1.11) software. In vitroADP-ribosylation of the nuclear extract was performed using modification of a previously published procedure (23Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine C. Brochu G. Desnoyers S. Lagueux J. Verreault A. Hoflack J.C. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 ml of nuclear extract containing 25 mg of protein from SK-BR-3 cells was mixed with an equal volume of a buffer containing 200 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 20 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm dithiothreitol. ADP-ribosylation was induced by the addition of 10 μg of DNase I (Worthington)-activated salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) and 10 μm NAD (Calbiochem) to one-half of the extract. To the other half of the extract (control), only activated DNA was added. Both batches of extracts were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of 1 mm 3-aminobenzamide (Calbiochem) and chilling on ice. BUR affinity chromatography was performed separately for the ribosylated and the control extract as described above except that the elution was carried out in a single step with 1 m KCl in equilibration buffer. Southwestern analysis was performed as described previously (20Kohwi-Shigematsu T. deBelle I. Dickinson L.A. Galande S. Kohwi Y. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 323-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty μg of 0.4 m NaCl nuclear extract from SK-BR-3 cells was diluted with an equal volume of PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and precleared with mouse IgG and protein A/G plus beads (Pierce). Briefly, 1 μl of 0.1 mg/ml mouse IgG 1 and IgG 2a each (Sigma) were added to the extract and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by the addition of 10 μl of protein A/G plus beads and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotating shaker. The precleared extract was incubated with 2 μl of either anti-PARP (clone CII-10, PharMingen) or anti-Ku (clone 162, NeoMarkers) for 8 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of 10 μl of protein A/G plus beads and further incubation at 4 °C for 8 h. The beads were then washed four times with 500 μl of PBS each containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The washed beads were resuspended in 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Solubilized immunoprecipitates were obtained by centrifugation and analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitates obtained from an equal amount of nuclear extract were subjected to immunoblot analysis, and the entire amount of immunoprecipitated protein was loaded on the gel to compare the results. For GST pull-down assay, the NaCl concentration in the reaction mixtures was adjusted to 0.2 m, and the glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were washed four times with 500 μl of PBS each, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis as described above. Multimeric wild type and mutant MAR DNA fragments were prepared as described (14Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The various subfragments of the μ enhancer were generated by digesting the 1-kb Cμ region-containing plasmid (13Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with HinfI andXbaI. DNA binding was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled end-filled DNA as described (20Kohwi-Shigematsu T. deBelle I. Dickinson L.A. Galande S. Kohwi Y. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 323-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Minicircles were prepared by blunt end ligation of these DNAs using 20 units/μl T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) followed by treatment with 5 units/μl exonuclease III (New England Biolabs) to eliminate DNA molecules with free ends. The exonuclease III-resistant minicircles were gel-purified and were also confirmed to be resistant to S1 nuclease. Binding reactions with both linear and circular DNAs contained 50–100-fold excess ofXmnI-ScaI fragment of pBluescript as competitor DNA (17Yanagisawa J. Ando J. Nakayama J. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 457-462PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation at 25 °C for 15 min, the reaction products were loaded on 6% native polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 150 V in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Data were quantified by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms as described above. For purification of BUR-binding proteins, we used a combination of mutated and wild type BUR columns as described previously (17Yanagisawa J. Ando J. Nakayama J. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T.

For the preparation of BUR affinity columns, we used a 25-bp sequence derived from the MAR located 3′ of the IgH enhancer containing the core unwinding element. The mutated BUR column was prepared using a 24-bp sequence derived from the same region as the 25-bp sequence except that the core unwinding element was mutated (20Kohwi-Shigematsu T. deBelle I.

Larrick J.W. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)7 confers high affinity to the nuclear matrix and high propensity for unwinding; therefore, it is a BUR. On the other hand, a similarly multimerized mutated sequence, mutated (24de Murcia G. Menessier-de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar)8 does not possess either feature (2Bode J. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L. Joh T. Klehr D. Mielke C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T.

Nuclear extract from SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells was passed successively through a non-MAR (mutated BUR) and a MAR (wild type BUR) affinity column to select for BUR-specific binding proteins. A 114-kDa MAR-binding protein from breast cancer cells specifically bound to a double-stranded BUR affinity column (17Yanagisawa J. Ando J. Nakayama J. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 457-462PubMed Google Scholar) was identified as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3S. Galande, J. Yanagisawa, C. Lee, Y. Kohwi, and T. Kohwi-Shigematsu, manuscript in preparation. This posed an apparent paradox because PARP has been known to bind in a sequence-independent manner only to the ends and nicks in DNA (24de Murcia G. Menessier-de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that three other polypeptides of apparent molecular masses of 460, 86, and 70 kDa almost exclusively copurified with p114 from a BUR affinity column (Fig.1 A). Peptide microsequence analysis of p70 revealed its identity with the p70 subunit of Ku autoantigen (22Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggested that the other proteins that copurified may represent individual polypeptide subunits of DNA-PK. We next performed Western blot analysis of various fractions from either wild type (WT) MAR or mutated (MUT) MAR affinity columns to compare the binding of PARP and Ku and to verify the immunological identity of the purified proteins. Since we used identical amounts (20 μl each) of the column fractions for the immunoblot analysis, the amount of PARP and/or Ku70/86 present in any given fraction could be directly quantitated and compared by the corresponding signal on the immunoblots. We typically observed that less than 10% of the input amount of PARP and Ku70/86 was bound to the MUT MAR column as judged by the amount of protein in the column flow-through (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 1 and 2 in MUT MAR panels), whereas virtually all of PARP and Ku70/86 were retained by the WT MAR column as judged by the weak signals in the column flow-through (Fig. 1 B, lane 2 in WT MAR panels). Both columns were then washed with equilibration buffer containing 0.1m KCl to remove loosely bound proteins. Up to 30% of input PARP and Ku were removed at this step from both WT and MUT MAR columns (Fig. 1 B, lane 3 in respective panels). The columns were then eluted in two steps of increasing concentration of KCl to collect bound proteins. The bound PARP and Ku70/86 were almost quantitatively eluted from the WT MAR column with 0.3 mKCl- and 1 m KCl-containing buffers (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 5, respectively, in WT MAR panels). In contrast, extremely low amounts of PARP and Ku70/86 were left to be eluted from the MUT MAR column under identical conditions (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 5 in MUT MAR panels). Quantification of the immunoblot signals corresponding to 0.3 and 1 m KCl eluates from both these columns revealed that the WT MAR column bound at least 10-fold more of PARP and Ku as compared with that of the MUT MAR column. These results suggest that both PARP and Ku70/86 exhibit selective binding to the WT MAR column over the MUT MAR column. The immunoblot analysis of the 1 m KCl eluate from the WT MAR column also confirmed the immunological identity of PARP and both subunits of the Ku autoantigen (Fig. 1 B, lane 5 in WT MAR panels). In addition, by using an antibody against the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK, we confirmed the identity of p460 as the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (data not shown). All three of the proteins that copurified were thus subunits of DNA-PK, suggesting that PARP might be physically associated with DNA-PK by interacting with at least one of its subunits in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to separate the individual components of this putative complex by employing ion exchange column chromatography. However, we observed that PARP and Ku70/86 always copurified through a variety of matrices such as DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose (data not shown). This copurification was observed in the presence of up to 0.6m KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, the conditions that we typically employed for elution of these proteins from the BUR affinity matrix. Separation of these proteins to near-homogeneity was ultimately achieved by taking advantage of the extremely high affinity of PARP to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Both Ku70/86 and PARP bound the ssDNA cellulose column. However, as depicted in Fig. 1 C, p70 and p86 subunits of Ku autoantigen co-eluted at 0.4 m NaCl (Fig. 1 C, lane 2), whereas PARP eluted at 0.7 mNaCl (Fig. 1 C, lane 3) from the ssDNA cellulose matrix.Figure 5Synergistic binding of Ku autoantigen and native PARP to linear Cμ 3′ MAR.

GST-PARP-DBD was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Beads) alone (lane 1) or with Ku and the beads (lane 2). As a control, Ku70/86 was incubated alone with the beads (lane 3). The complexes were recovered by low speed centrifugation and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Western blot was stained with polyclonal anti-GST-PARP (top panel) and then stripped and reprobed with antibodies against both p70 and p86 subunits of Ku (bottom panel). Lane 4 (bottom panel only) depicts the position of Ku subunits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Upon autoribosylation, PARP has been shown to lose its DNA end binding activity, and this feedback mechanism has been implicated in base excision repair (18Satoh M.S.

Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of autoribosylation of PARP on its double-stranded BUR binding activity. ADP-ribosylation was stimulated in nuclear extract of SK-BR-3 cells by the addition of NAD and nicked DNA, and the ribosylated extract was loaded successively onto mutated and wild type BUR affinity columns. After washing the columns with equilibration buffer, bound proteins were eluted in two steps using 0.3 m KCl- and 1m KCl-containing buffer. Both PARP and Ku70/86 from the ADP-ribosylated extract bound neither the MUT MAR column nor the WT MAR column and were quantitatively recovered in the flow-through of both columns as revealed by immunoblot analysis (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and 3,respectively). Washing the columns with the equilibration buffer did not yield either of the two proteins indicating loss of loose binding (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 5). Elution with 0.3 m KCl- and 1 m KCl-containing buffers did not elute any of the two proteins (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6–9) confirming the lack of binding of both Ku and PARP to either column. Based on these data, we conclude that ADP-ribosylation of SK-BR-3 nuclear extract resulted in the loss of the BUR binding activity of both PARP and Ku.Figure 3Physical association of Ku autoantigen and PARP in vivo and in vitro. A, Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates from nuclear extracts. Immunoprecipitates obtained after incubating the precleared nuclear extract from SK-BR-3 cells with appropriate antibody and protein A/G plus beads were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.

The reaction of lipid hydroperoxide toward the lysine moiety was investigated employingN-benzoyl-glycyl-l-lysine (Bz-Gly-Lys) as a model compound of Lys residues in protein and 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HPODE) as a model of the lipid hydroperoxides.

The amide-type adduct may be a useful marker for the lipid hydroperoxide-derived modification of biomolecules. During lipid peroxidation, biomolecules such as proteins or aminolipids can be covalently modified by lipid decomposition products. For the case of aliphatic aldehydes (alkanals) such as 1-hexanal or 1-nonanal, the N ε-amino groups of the lysine residues in protein can be modified through the formation of a Schiff base. α,β-Unsaturated aldehydes (alkenals) such as acrolein or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal react with lysine, cysteine, and histidine through a Michael-type addition (1Esterbauer H.

Methyl linoleate hydroperoxide (MLOOH) was prepared by the reaction of soybean lipoxygenase with methyl linoleate (ML). A 200-mg sample of ML and sodium deoxycholate (1.62 g) was dissolved in 240 ml of 200 mm borate buffer (pH 9.0). Lipoxygenase (100 mg, Sigma type I-B) was added to the solution and reacted for 3 h at room temperature. The formed peroxide was extracted twice with an equal amount of chloroform/methanol (1:1). The collected chloroform layer was evaporated. The obtained peroxide was purified by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and developed with n-hexane/ether (6:4). The peroxide was extracted with CHCl3 and then evaporated. The amount of MLOOH was calculated from the molar coefficient, ε234 nm=25000 m−1cm−1 using the value of linoleic acid hydroperoxide (11Verhagen J. Bouman A.A. Vliegenthart J.F.C. Boldingh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 486: 114-120Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Bz-Gly-Lys (5 mm) and lipid-free BSA (5 mg/ml) were typically incubated with 13-HPODE, 15-HPETE, or MLOOH (5 mm) at 37 °C in 0.1 mphosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 3 days. The lipid hydroperoxide-modified proteins were isolated by ethanol precipitation as already described (9Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kato Y. Osawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To obtain 13-HPODE-modified Bz-Gly-Lys, 5 mm Bz-Gly-Lys was incubated with 5 mm 13-HPODE for 3 days at 37 °C in phosphate buffer and then freeze-dried. The sample was extracted with methanol to remove the large amounts of inorganic salts. The extract was evaporated, dissolved in H2O, and then applied to gel filtration chromatography (TOYOPEAL HW-40F, 1.5 × 50 cm) with H2O as an eluent at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The fractions (5 ml each) were monitored by absorbance at 234 nm and lipofuscin-like fluorescence (excitation, 350 nm; emission, 420 nm) using a JASCO Ubest-50 UV-visible spectrophotometer and Hitachi F2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively. The fluorescent fractions 29–34 were used for further identification because the fluorescence might be considered as a marker of lipid amine adducts. The fluorescent fractions were concentrated and then applied to a Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters) with 0–100% methanol (20% stepwise) elution. The 20% methanol fraction was used for the isolation of the modified lysine derivative, because it had the strongest fluorescence. The fraction was next applied to reversed-phase HPLC (Develosil ODS-HG-5 (8 × 250 mm), Nomura Chemical Co.) and then fractionated using gradient elution (solvent A, 0.1% acetic acid/CH3CN (7/3); solvent B, 0.1% acetic acid/CH3CN (1/1)) at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. The gradient program was as follows: 0 min (B 0%), 10 min (B 0%), 50 min (B 100%), 60 min (B 100%), and 61 min (B 0%). The elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 234 nm. The peak (retention time 30 min) was further purified by repeated reversed-phase HPLC. The obtained compound X weighed 1.3 mg. Spectral data of the isolated compound X are as follows: 1H NMR (CD3OD) (ppm) 0.80 (t, J = 6.9Hz, 3H), 1.19 (m, 2H), 1.23 (m, 2H), 1.32 (m, 2H), 1,42 (m, 2H), 1.49 (m, 2H), 1.62 (m, 1H), 1.83 (m, 1H), 2.06 (t, J = 7.7Hz, 2H), 3.05 (t, J = 6.7Hz, 2H), 3.99 (m, 2H), 4.30 (m, 1H), 7.37 (t, J = 5.1Hz, 2H), 7.45 (t, J = 5.1Hz, 1H), 7.78 (d, J = 7.1Hz, 2H); FAB+-MSm/z 406 (M+H)+, 428 (M+Na)+. For the first step, benzoyl-glycine (1 eq.) and the Nε-(carboxybenzoyl)lysine methyl ester (1 eq.) were conjugated in dimethylformamide (DMF) with EDC (1.1 eq.) in the presence of an enhancer, NHS (1.1 eq.), as described previously (12Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) with some modifications. After an overnight reaction at room temperature, the reaction mixture was dissolved with ethyl acetate and then washed with equal amounts of 1 N HCl, water, 5% NaHCO3, and then water. The residual ethyl acetate layer was passed through Na2SO4 for dehydration. The eluent was concentrated, and the crude N-benzoyl-glycyl-Nε-(carboxybenzoyl)lysine methyl ester was crystallized with water/ethanol at 4 °C for 3 h. The removal of carboxybenzoyl from the purified peptide was performed using Pd-C under H2 for 3 h at room temperature in water/methanol. The obtained N-benzoyl-glycyl-l-lysine methyl ester was purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC (Develosil ODS-5 (20 × 250 mm), Nomura Chemical Co.) using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, CH3CN (5/3) as the eluent. Hexanoic acid and the N-benzoyl-glycyl-l-lysine methyl ester were conjugated with EDC and NHS as described previously. The reaction mixture was washed as already described, and the residual product was purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a Develosil ODS-5 (20 × 250 mm) using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, CH3CN (5/3) as the eluent. TheN-benzoyl-glycyl-N ε-(hexanonyl)lysine methyl ester was treated with 0.25 n NaOH at 37 °C for 1 h to remove the methyl ester. The obtained compound was purified by reversed-phase HPLC on the column using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, CH3CN (5/3) as the eluent. The identification was performed by 1H NMR and mass spectroscopy. The spectral data of the syntheticN-benzoyl-glycyl-N ε-(hexanonyl)lysine are as follows: 1H NMR (CD3OD) (ppm) 0.80 (t,J = 6.9 Hz, 3H), 1.20 (m, 2H), 1.24 (m, 2H), 1.34 (m, 2H), 1.42 (m, 2H), 1.49 (m, 2H), 1.66 (m, 1H), 1.84 (m, 1H), 2.06 (t,J = 7.4 Hz, 2H), 3.07 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 2H), 3.99 (m, 2H), 4.34 (m, 1H), 7.37 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 7.45 (t, J = 5.2 Hz, 1H), 7.77 (d,J = 7.2 Hz, 2H); FAB+-MSm/z 406 (M + H)+, 428 (M + Na)+. N-Benzoyl-glycyl-N ε-(hexanonyl(D-11))lysine derivative was prepared using D-11-hexanoic acid as follows. Briefly, benzoyl-glycyl-l-lysine was conjugated with D-11-hexanoic acid using EDC and NHS as coupling reagents (12Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The obtained benzoyl-glycyl-N ε-(hexanonyl)lysine was isolated and purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a Develosil ODS-HG-5 (8 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, CH3CN (5/3) at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. The elution was estimated by UV absorbance at 234 nm, and identification of the synthetic deuterified hexanonyl compound was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). TheN-acetyl-glycyl-N ε-(hexanonyl)-l-lysine methyl ester (N ε-hexanonyl AGLME) was prepared by conjugation between AGLME and hexanoic acid using EDC as the coupling reagent and NHS as the enhancer, as described previously. The synthetic compound could not be separated with ethyl acetate/water fractionation because of its high water solubility. Therefore, the reaction mixture was diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and passed through a Sep-Pak cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the products were then eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, CH3CN (1/1). The eluent was concentrated and applied to preparative reversed-phase HPLC (Develosil ODS-5 (20 × 250 mm)) using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, CH3CN (7:3) as the eluent. The elution was monitored by absorbance at 215 nm. The peak was collected and concentrated. The obtainedN-acetyl-glycyl-N ε-(hexanonyl)-l-lysine methyl ester (N ε-hexanonyl AGLME) was identified by 1H NMR and mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). The spectral data of N ε-hexanonyl AGLME are as follows: 1H NMR (CD3OD) (ppm) 0.71 (t,J = 7.1 Hz, 3H), 1.09 (m, 2H), 1.14 (m, 2H), 1.20 (m, 2H), 1.31 (m, 2H), 1.40 (m, 2H), 1.49 (m, 1H), 1.63 (m, 1H), 1.80 (s, 3H), 1.97 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 2H), 2.96 (t,J = 6.9 Hz, 2H), 3.51 (s, 3H), 3.68 (m, 2H), 4.22 (m, 1H); LC-MS (ESP+) m/z 358 (M + H)+. Samples were hydrolyzed with 6n HCl in vacuo at 105 °C. The hydrolysates were dried, dissolved in citrate buffer (pH 2.2), and then applied to an amino acid analyzer, JLC-500 (JEOL). The conjugation of hexanoic acid with proteins was performed as follows. Hexanoic acid (2.3 mg), EDC (4.5 mg), and sulfo-NHS (5 mg) were dissolved in 400 μl of dimethylformamide, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 24 h at room temperature. To the solution, 0.95 ml of KLH or BSA (10 mg in 0.1 mphosphate buffer (pH 7.4)) was added and further incubated for 4 h at room temperature. The obtained hexanonyl proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 3 days at 4 °C. The hexanonyl KLH was emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and 1 ml of the solution was then intramuscularly injected into a New Zealand White rabbit. After 4 weeks, 1 ml of the hexanonyl KLH emulsified with an equal volume of incomplete adjuvant (0.5 mg/ml) was injected as a booster every 2 weeks until an adequate antibody generation occurred. Hexanonyl BSA was used for the evaluation of the antibody generation specific to hexanonyl protein. Conjugates of acetic acid (C2), propionic acid (C3), butyric acid (C4), valeric acid (C5), heptanoic acid (C7), octanoic acid (C8), nonanoic acid (C9), decanoic acid (C10), and undecanoic acid (C11) with BSA were prepared using EDC and NHS as coupling agents as described previously. Glutaric acid-BSA was prepared as follows (13Murakami M. Horiuchi S. Tanaka K. Morino Y. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipid-free BSA (4 mg/ml) in PBS was mixed with an equal volume of saturated sodium acetate. Under ice-cool conditions, glutaric anhydride (3 mm) was added and reacted for 1 h. The modified BSA was dialyzed against water at 4 °C for 24 h. Azelaic acid-BSA conjugate was prepared as follows. First, the monomethylazelaic acid (50 mg), EDC (52.2 mg), and NHS (31.3 mg) in dimethylformamide (1 ml) were incubated at room temperature for 24 h. Five milliliters of BSA solution (30 mg/ml in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)) was then added to the solution and then incubated at room temperature for 16 h. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C for 3 days. Azelaic acid-BSA conjugate was prepared from obtained monomethylazelaic acid-BSA by saponification. Alkaine solution (0.25 m NaOH) was added to the monomethylazelaic acid-BSA and further incubated for 1 h. After neutralization with HCl, the reaction mixture was dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C for 24 h. These conjugations were evaluated by the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid method (14Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3603-3608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The losses (%) of lysine residue were as follows: C2, 72%; C3, 40%; C4, 17%; C5, 90%; C6 (hexanonyl BSA), 91%; C7, 91%; C8, 89%; C9, 89%; C10, 94%; C11, 90%; glutaric acid-BSA, 38%; azelaic acid-BSA, 62%. Oxidized lipid-modified proteins were prepared as follows. Lipid (linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, 5 mm; cardiolipin, 1 mg/ml) was oxidized by 5 mm ascorbic acid and 0.05 mm FeCl3 for 24 h at 37 °C in PBS containing 20% methanol. To the reaction mixture, lipid-free BSA (final concentration, 5 mg/ml) was added and further incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. To isolate the modified proteins, an equal amount of CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1) was added, vigorously mixed, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The lower layer was discarded, and an equal amount of CHCl3 was added and mixed. After centrifugation, the lower layer was discarded again. To the residual upper layer, 9 volumes of ice-cool ethanol was added and kept for 45 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in water with sonication. The protein solution was dialyzed against water for 2 days at 4 °C. Aldehyde-modified proteins were prepared as already described (9Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kato Y. Osawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The preparation of lipid hydroperoxide-modified proteins was as follows. The hydroperoxides (13-HPODE or 15-HPETE) were incubated with lipid-free BSA at 37 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 3 days. Oxidized BSA was prepared by the incubation of lipid free-BSA with hydrogen peroxide/metal ion (9Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kato Y. Osawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Modified proteins were dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C for 2 days. The concentration of all modified proteins was measured by a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Human LDL was isolated from healthy volunteers using density centrifugation (15Kato Y. Tokunaga K. Osawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The modification of LDL was performed by copper ion and 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) as described previously (9Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The modification by copper ion was performed by incubation of LDL (0.2 mg/ml) with 50 μmCuSO4 in PBS at 37 °C. AAPH-induced oxidation of LDL was carried out by incubation of AAPH (0–5 mm) with LDL (0.2 mg/ml) in PBS at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μm butylated hydroxytoluene and 1 mm EDTA. The measurements of lipid peroxidation were performed by the following two methods. The generation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance was measured as described previously (9Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kato Y. Osawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The formation of lipid peroxide was measured by a Determiner LPO kit (Kyowa medix), a colorimetric method based on the reaction of lipid peroxides with a methylene blue derivative in the presence of hemoglobin (16Yagi K. Kiuchi K. Saito Y. Miike A. Kayahara N. Tatano T. Ohishi N. Biochem. Int. 1986; 12: 367-371PubMed Google Scholar). The sample was applied to a liquid chromatograph on a Develosil ODS-HG-5 (4.6 × 250 mm), which was connected with a mass spectrometer (PLATFORM II, VG Biotech). The separation was performed by a two-pump gradient. The solvent A for AGLME was 0.1% acetic acid; solvent B for AGLME was CH3CN. For the Bz-Gly-Lys system, solvent A was 0.1% acetic acid, CH3CN(7/3), and solvent B was 0.1% acetic acid, CH3CN (3:7). The gradient programs were as follows: AGLME, 0 min, A 100%; 70 min, A 30%; 75 min, A 30%; 80 min, A 100%. Bz-Gly-Lys, 0 min, A 100%; 30 min, A 0%; 35 min, A 0%; 40 min, A 100%. The electrospray ionization (positive) mode was used for the detection. For the measurements of theN ε-hexanonyl derivative of Bz-Gly-Lys, deuterified hexanonyl Bz-Gly-Lys was added to samples at a concentration of 19 μm before the analysis as an internal standard. Indirect noncompetitive ELISA was performed as already described (9Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kato Y. Osawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of antigen in PBS was dispensed into a well and kept at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with Block Ace (Dainihon Seiyaku, Osaka, Japan), 100 μl of antiserum (1/5000 in PBS containing 0.5% BSA) was added to the well. The binding of the antibody on the coated antigen was evaluated as already described (9Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kato Y. Osawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cross-reactivity of the low molecular weight compound with antibody was investigated by indirect competitive ELISA (9Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kato Y. Osawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As a coating agent, 50 μl of hexanonyl BSA (0.5 μg/ml) was pipetted onto wells and kept at 4 °C overnight. At the same time, 50 μl of antiserum (1/2500 in PBS containing 1% BSA) and 50 μl of sample were mixed in an Eppendolf tube and reacted at 4 °C overnight. The plate was washed, and 90 μl of the reacted solution was pipetted onto a well. The binding of the residual antibody on coated hexanonyl BSA was estimated as described previously (9Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kato Y. Osawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The effects of the preincubation of 13-HPODE on the formation of N ε-(hexanonyl)lysine were investigated as follows: 13-HPODE (50 mm) was incubated in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% methanol at 37 °C. Fifty μl of the incubated solution was withdrawn, and a 10-times diluted sample was reacted with 5 mm substrate (Bz-Gly-Lys/BSA) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at 37 °C for 3 days. The reaction mixture of Bz-Gly-Lys and preincubated 13-HPODE was stored at −70 °C until LC-MS analysis (see above). The “preincubated 13-HPODE”-modified BSA was isolated from the reaction mixture by ice-cool ethanol precipitation and used for ELISA as described in the previous section. At the same time, an aliquot of the incubated solution of 13-HPODE was used for the measurement of the loss of 13-HPODE. Fifty μl of the preincubated solution was reduced with 100 μl of 100 mm NaBH4 in 1 mNaOH and further incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The reduction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 1nHCl, and the amount of 13-HODE obtained was measured by reversed-phase HPLC on a Develosil ODS-HG-5 (4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, methanol (1/3) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The detection was monitored by the absorbance at 234 nm. Tissue sections were prepared from frozen arteries (8 μm thick). Before immunostaining, frozen sections were fixed by incubation in ice-cold acetone for 20 min. Sections were incubated with 10% normal goat serum in PBS (20 min) to block nonspecific binding before staining and then with primary antibody (1:350 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated with 5% normal rabbit serum or the anti-HEL antibody preabsorbed with hexanonyl BSA instead of the primary antibody as negative controls. Immunostaining was performed with anti-rabbit antibody peroxidase-label (1:50 dilution, DAKO) with hydrogen peroxide and 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. Sections were counterstained with aqueous hematoxylin. To search for the specific hydroperoxide-derived lysine modification, we used Bz-Gly-Lys as the substrate, and the isolation of the 13-HPODE-modified lysine derivative was performed. To remove large amounts of unreacted Bz-Gly-Lys, the reaction mixture was concentrated and then applied to gel filtration chromatography using TOYOPEAL HW-40 (TOSOH) as a gel. The fractions were monitored by absorbance at 234 nm and lipofuscin-like fluorescence (Fig.1 A). As a result of the HPLC analysis of each fraction, fractions 35–40 contained the unreacted substrate, Bz-Gly-Lys. Fractions 29–34 had a lipofuscin-like fluorescence, which could be considered as a marker of lipid decomposition product-modified molecules. Therefore, the fluorescent fractions were used for further isolation. The mixed fractions 29–34 were applied to a Sep-Pak cartridge with stepwise methanol elutions. The HPLC profile of the 20% methanol fraction is shown in Fig.1 B. A compound, labeled X, was then isolated by repeated reversed-phase HPLC. The molecular weight of X, 405, was confirmed by FAB-MS. Compound X was hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl at 105 °Cin vacuo and submitted for amino acid analysis. Interestingly, both Gly and Lys were completely recovered from the acid hydrolysates of compound X (Gly/Lys = 0.96). This suggested that the bond between the lipid-derived structure and Bz-Gly-Lys was acid liable such as an amide bond or a Schiff base. The structure of X was elucidated using 1H NMR. The proposed structure of X with the parent molecules is shown in Fig.2 A. To confirm the structure of compound X, the synthesis of theN ε-(hexanonyl)lysine adduct was performed by carbodiimide conjugation of the lysine derivative with hexanoic acid. The instrumental analysis of the syntheticN-benzoyl-glycyl-N ε-(hexanonyl)lysine almost agreed with that of isolated compound X. Neither the isolated compound X nor the synthetic N ε-hexanonyl adduct had any fluorescence. The time-dependent changes in Bz-Gly-Lys during incubation with 13-HPODE were examined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, a loss of Bz-Gly-Lys was observed in a time-dependent fashion, and the formation ofN-benzoyl-glycyl-N ε-(hexanonyl)lysine, compound X, was confirmed. The conversion yield of compound X from the loss of Bz-Gly-Lys after a 3-day incubation with 13-HPODE was 5.6%. To further confirm the formation of theN ε-(hexanonyl)lysine named “HEL” in the 13-HPODE-modified Lys, the AGLME was incubated with 13-HPODE, and the formation of the HEL derivative was investigated. After a 3-day incubation, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was applied to LC-MS. The product, which shows m/z 358 as an (M + H)+ ion, corresponding toN ε-hexanonyl AGLME (M r357), was eluted at a retention time of 40.79 min, and this completely agreed with the elution time of the syntheticN ε-hexanonyl AGLME (Fig.3). The mass charts of both the product and the synthetic N ε-hexanonyl AGLME showed the same fragmentation pattern."

The purified dehalogenase catalyzed the reductive removal of a halogen atom from the ortho position of 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate, 2-chlorophenol, 2,3-dichlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,6-dichlorophenol, pentachlorophenol, and 2-bromo-4-chlorophenol with reduced methyl viologen as electron donor. The dechlorination of 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate was catalyzed by the enzyme at a V max of 28 units/mg protein and a K m of 20 μm. The pH and temperature optimum were 8.2 and 52 °C, respectively. EPR analysis indicated one [4Fe-4S] cluster (midpoint redox potential (E m) = −440 mV), one [3Fe-4S] cluster (E m = +70 mV), and one cobalamin per 48-kDa monomer. The Co(I)/Co(II) transition had an E m of −370 mV. Via a reversed genetic approach based on the N-terminal sequence, the corresponding gene was isolated from a D. dehalogenans genomic library, cloned, and sequenced. This revealed the presence of two closely linked genes: (i) cprA, encoding the o-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase, which contains a twin-arginine type signal sequence that is processed in the purified enzyme; (ii) cprB, coding for an integral membrane protein that could act as a membrane anchor of the dehalogenase.

This first biochemical and molecular characterization of a chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase has revealed structural resemblance with haloalkene reductive dehalogenases. Anaerobic bacteria that are able to conserve metabolic energy from the dechlorination of chlorinated compounds have gained a lot of attention because of their role in bioremediation of contaminated sites and the novel respiration pathways they possess (1El Fantroussi S. Naveau H. Agathos S.N. Biotechnol. Prog. 1998; 14: 167-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Halorespiring bacteria have been found within the groups of low G + C Gram-positives, green nonsulfur bacteria, and δ- and ε- proteobacteria. These bacteria can use chloroalkenes, e.g. tetrachloroethene (PCE) 1The abbreviations PCEtetrachloroetheneTCEtrichloroetheneCl-OHPA3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl acetateCPchlorophenolDCPdichlorophenolPCRpolymerase chain reactionORFopen reading frameo-CP dehalogenaseortho-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase 1The abbreviations PCEtetrachloroetheneTCEtrichloroetheneCl-OHPA3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl acetateCPchlorophenolDCPdichlorophenolPCRpolymerase chain reactionORFopen reading frameo-CP dehalogenaseortho-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenaseand trichloroethene (TCE) or chloroaromatic compounds such as chlorophenols or 3-chlorobenzoate as the terminal electron acceptor. tetrachloroethene trichloroethene 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl acetate chlorophenol dichlorophenol polymerase chain reaction open reading frame ortho-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase tetrachloroethene trichloroethene 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl acetate chlorophenol dichlorophenol polymerase chain reaction open reading frame ortho-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase The halorespiratory pathway of anaerobic PCE degradation has been studied in some detail. A key enzyme in this respiratory pathway is the PCE reductive dehalogenase, which catalyzes the reductive removal of a chlorine atom from PCE and TCE. A 58-kDa PCE reductive dehalogenase was purified from Dehalospirillum multivorans, which contains cobalamin and probably two iron-sulfur clusters (2Neumann A. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16515-16519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cloning and sequencing of the corresponding pceA gene revealed the presence of an additional open reading frame, pceB, being cotranscribed with pceA and coding for an 8-kDa membrane-spanning protein (3Neumann A. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4140-4145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCE reductive dehalogenases isolated from Dehalobacter restrictus (60 kDa) andDesulfitobacterium frappieri strain PCE-S (65 kDa) resemble the enzyme from Dehalospirillum multivorans with respect to cofactor content and catalytic properties (4Schumacher W. Holliger C. Zehnder A.J.B. Hagen W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Miller E. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). EPR analysis of theD. restrictus enzyme confirmed the presence of cobalamin and two [4Fe-4S] clusters. All chloro alkene reductive dehalogenases characterized up to now are monomeric and either membrane-bound or membrane-associated. Enzymes involved in chloroaryl respiration have been studied inDesulfomonile tiedjei and Desulfitobacteriumspecies (6Ni S. Fredrickson J.K. Xun L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5135-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Löffler F.E. Sanford R.A. Tiedje J.M. Appl. Environ.

However, no further molecular characterization of these enzymes was reported. We investigated ortho-chlorophenol dechlorination inDesulfitobacterium dehalogenans. This organism is able to couple the reductive dechlorination of differentortho-chlorinated phenolic compounds to growth with lactate, pyruvate, formate, or hydrogen as electron donor (9Utkin I. Woese C. Wiegel J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1994; 44: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Utkin I. Dalton D.D. Wiegel J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 346-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of biomass yields on pyruvate and different electron acceptors indicated that chlorophenol dechlorination in D. dehalogenans is an energy-yielding process (11Mackiewicz N. Wiegel J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 352-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study for the first time describes the purification and characterization of the catalytic subunit of theortho-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase (o-CP dehalogenase) from Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans. Its redox properties were studied by EPR spectroscopy, and the corresponding cprA gene was cloned and characterized, revealing structural resemblance with haloalkene reductive dehalogenases. D. dehalogenans strain JW/IU-DC1 (DSM 9161) was cultivated under anaerobic conditions (100% N2 gas phase) in 25-liter vessels containing 20 liters of basal medium as described by Neumannet al. (12Neumann A. Scholz-Muramatsu H. Diekert G. Arch. Microbiol. 1994; 162: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract, 20 mm lactate sodium salt, 20 mm3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl acetate, 50 mm NaHCO3, and trace elements and vitamin solution as recommended by the German Collection of Microorganisms. The 20-liter cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. After 1 day of incubation, 250 ml of 2m NaOH was added to the culture to avoid acidification of the medium. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used as a host for cloning vectors. The strain was grown in Luria Bertani medium at 37 °C, and ampicillin was added at 100 μg/ml when appropriate. The cloning vectors pUC18 and pUC19 were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and pMON38201 was obtained from Monsanto. Late exponential phase cultures of D. dehalogenans were harvested by continuous flow centrifugation at 16,000 × g (Biofuge 28RS, Heraeus Sepatech), which yielded 1.6 g of concentrated cells/liter of culture. The concentrated cells were stored at −20 °C. 8 g of cells was resuspended in 8 ml of buffer 1, consisting of 100 mm potassium phosphate (KPi), pH 7.5, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. A few crystals of DNase I were added to the cell suspension. Cells were broken by sonication (Vibra, Sonic Materials Inc.) under anaerobic conditions. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated for 10 min in the presence of 0.5m KCl and 0.02% Triton X-100 and then separated into a membrane fraction and a soluble fraction by centrifugation for 90 min at 140,000 × g and 4 °C. The membrane fraction was resuspended in 8 ml of buffer 1 supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 20% glycerol and incubated for 60 min under anaerobic conditions at 4 °C. The insoluble fraction was removed from this preparation by centrifugation for 60 min at 140,000 × g and 4 °C. The solubilized enzyme fraction was stored under a N2 gas phase at 4 °C. All chromatographic steps were performed by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in an anaerobic chamber with N2/H2(95%/5%) gas phase. The Triton X-100 concentration of the sample was raised to 3% before it was applied to a column to prevent protein aggregation. The solubilized enzyme preparation was loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (2.2 × 8.9 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm KPi, pH 6.0, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The column was eluted with a 75-ml linear gradient from 0 to 300 mm NaCl in buffer A at a flow of 2.5 ml/min. The o-CP dehalogenase activity was eluted at a NaCl concentration of approximately 180 mm. Fractions containing the highest dechlorinating activity were pooled and diluted with an equal volume of buffer A. The sample was applied on a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A. The enzyme was eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient from 0 to 400 mm NaCl in buffer A and a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at a NaCl concentration of 180 mm. Combined fractions containing dechlorinating activity were mixed with an equal volume of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1% w/v Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and applied on a Mono Q column equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme activity was eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient from 0 to 400 mm NaCl in buffer B and a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at a NaCl concentration of 280 mm. Chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase activity was assayed in stoppered 1-cm cuvettes at 30 °C and pH 7.8 by photometric recording of the oxidation of titanium(III) citrate reduced methyl viologen at 578 nm (ε578 = 9.7 mm−1·cm−1) as described by Schumacher and Holliger (13Schumacher W. Holliger C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2328-2333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 0.3 mm methyl viologen and had an initial absorption at 578 nm of 2.6. The assay was started by the addition of 20 μl of 50 mm Cl-OHPA to give a final concentration of 1 mm Cl-OHPA. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the reduction of 1 μmol of chlorinated substrate or the oxidation of 2 μmol of reduced methyl viologen per minute. The same specific activity was obtained whether methyl viologen oxidation, Cl-OHPA disappearance, or 4-hydroxyphenyl acetate appearance was followed. The protein content of the samples was determined according to Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The pH optimum was determined in a 200 mm Tris-maleate buffer ranging from pH 5.5 to 9.0. Michaelis-Menten constants were determined from Lineweaver-Burk representations of data obtained by determining the initial rate of Cl-OHPA reduction under the assay conditions described above and using 5 μm to 10 mm substrate in the cuvette. The molecular mass of the denatured protein was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). A low molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad) was used as reference. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The concentration of acid labile sulfur of three individual samples was determined according to Rabinowitz (16Rabinowitz J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The iron and cobalt content of three independent enzyme preparations was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Elan 6000, Perkin-Elmer). The protein concentration of the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry samples was determined by measuring the absorbance changes in the Rose Bengal binding assay as described by Elliot et al. (17Elliott J.I. Brewer J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. A correction factor was determined with purifiedo-CP dehalogenase to compare the Rose Bengal protein determination and the Bradford protein determination. A correction factor of 1.10 was applied for the Rose Bengal determinations. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 200 D spectrometer with cryogenics, peripheral equipment, and data acquisition as described previously (18Pierik A.J. Hagen W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the EPR samples was 0.4 mg/ml in buffer B. The enzyme was completely reduced in 45 min by deazaflavin/EDTA-mediated light reduction as described by Massey and Hemmerich (19Massey V. Hemmerich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5612-5614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deazaflavin was synthesized according to Janda and Hemmerich (20Janda M. Hemmerich P. Angew. Chem. 1976; 15: 443-444Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Purified enzyme was transferred from a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride, Millipore Corp.) by blotting with a Trans-Blot SD semidry transferring cell (Bio-Rad). Blotting was carried out at 14 V for 2 h using a transfer buffer containing 48 mm Tris, 39 mmglycine, and 20% methanol, pH 9.1. The transferred protein was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the blotted protein was determined as described by Schiltz et al. (21Schiltz E. Kreusch A. Nestel U. Schulz G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA from D. dehalogenanswas isolated as follows. Protoplasts were prepared from 12 ml of culture (A 600 = 0.4) as described by van Asseldonk et al. (22van Asseldonk M. de Vos W.M. Simons G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), recovered at 13,000 ×g for 2 min, and resuspended in 100 μl of THMS buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 3 mm MgCl2in 25% sucrose). After the addition of 400 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), containing 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaCl, and 0.5% SDS, chromosomal DNA was purified through successive steps of phenol/chloroform extraction and recovered by ethanol precipitation. Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli by using the alkaline lysis method, and standard DNA manipulations were performed according to established procedures (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and the manufacturers' instructions. Enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., Roche Molecular Biochemicals, or New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides and [α-32P]dATP were obtained from Life Technologies and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 65 and 50 °C, respectively. Posthybridization washes were conducted at 40 °C. Oligonucleotides used in this study were BG 444 (5′-GCI GA(A/G) ACI ATG AA(C/T) TA(C/T) GTI CCI GGI CCI ACI AA(C/T) GCI GCI (A/T)(C/G)I AA(A/G) (C/T)TI GGI CCI GT-3′, nucleotides 644–703), BG 458 (5′-GCC GGA GCC TTG ATC GC-3′, nucleotides 427–411), and BG 475 (5′-GGC AGG TCT GGG AGA ATT G-3′, nucleotides 1366–1384). In order to restrict the extent of degeneration for BG 444, inosine (I) was used at 3- or 4-fold degenerated positions. Inverse PCR (24Triglia T. Peterson M.G. Kemp D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) was performed as follows. Chromosomal DNA was digested withHincII and ligated at a concentration of 0.5 ng/μl. 5 ng of self-ligated DNA was used as the template in a 25-μl PCR reaction containing the following: 2 ng/μl each primer; 2.25 mmMgCl2; 200 μm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP; and 1 unit of Expand™ Long Template enzyme mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA was amplified using the GeneAmp®PCR System 2400 (Perkin-Elmer). After preheating to 94 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles were performed, consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, primer annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 68 °C for 3 min. After 10 cycles, the elongation time was extended with 20 s/cycle. A final extension of 7 min at 68 °C was included. PCR products were purified from agarose gel by Gene Clean (Bio 101) and cloned into pMON38201 cut with XcmI. DNA sequencing was performed using a Li-Cor DNA sequencer 4000L. Plasmid DNA used for sequencing reactions was purified with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen GmbH). Reactions were performed using the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Infrared labeled oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech. Sequence similarity searches and alignments were performed using the BLAST 2.0 program (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J.H. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59441) Google Scholar) (NCBI) and the programs Clustal X and GeneDoc (26Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G.

Nicholas, unpublished communication. respectively. o-Chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase was purified under strict anaerobic conditions from the membrane fraction of D. dehalogenans grown on lactate and 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate (TableI). The specific activity increased 90-fold upon purification and amounted to 28 units/mg protein with reduced methyl viologen as an artificial electron donor. The purified enzyme had a pH and temperature optimum of 8.1 and 52 °C, respectively. At 30 °C, the enzyme showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics for Cl-OHPA. The K m for this chlorinated substrate was determined to be 20 μm at a methyl viologen concentration of 0.3 mm. Cl-OHPA showed no inhibitory effect up to 10 mm, which was the highest concentration used. Several halogenated compounds were tested as possible alternative substrates for o-CP dehalogenase. Activity ofo-CP dehalogenase was observed with 2-CP, 2,3-dichlorophenol (2,3-DCP), 2,4-DCP, 2,6-DCP, and pentachlorophenol as substrate (TableII). 3-CP, 4-CP, and 2,5-DCP were not dechlorinated. Additionally, 2-bromo-4-chlorophenol, but not 2-fluoro-4-chlorophenol, could be dehalogenated. This confirms that reductive dehalogenation is the reaction mechanism of o-CP dehalogenase, since bromide and chloride are more readily reductively removed than fluoride. No activity was measured with PCE or TCE, indicating that chlorinated aliphatics do not serve as a substrate for the o-CP dehalogenase.Table IPurification scheme for ortho-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase of D. dehalogenansSampleProteinActivityaOne unit of activity is defined as the oxidation of 2 μmol of reduced methyl viologen.YieldSpecific activityPurification factormgunits%milliunit/mgCell-free extract419.01291003081.0Membrane fraction240.0101784231.4Solubilized fraction91.01098412104.0Q-Sepharose fraction21.110178478615.0Mono Q, pH 6.0, fraction4.4645014,61247.0Mono Q, pH 7.8, fraction2.1594627,87290.0O-CP dehalogenase activity was monitored throughout the fractionations of the cell extract of D. dehalogenans.a One unit of activity is defined as the oxidation of 2 μmol of reduced methyl viologen.

Open table in a new tab O-CP dehalogenase activity was monitored throughout the fractionations of the cell extract of D. dehalogenans. The rate of methyl viologen oxidation catalyzed by o-CP dehalogenase in the presence of different possible electron acceptors was spectrophotometrically followed at 30 °C. The reaction mixture contained 0.3 mm methyl viologen, 7 μg of dehalogenase, 1 mm electron acceptor, and 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.8.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified enzyme preparation revealed one band of approximately 48 kDa (Fig.1). An accurate determination of the native size of the enzyme was not possible due to the high concentration of detergent needed to prevent protein aggregation (data not shown). The analysis of metals revealed the presence of 0.7 ± 0.1 mol of cobalt and 7 ± 1.4 mol of iron atoms per mol of monomer. Acid-labile sulfur analysis showed 9.9 ± 1.2 mol of sulfur atoms/mol of monomer. We conclude from these results and the EPR data (see below) that 1 cobalamin and 2 iron-sulfur clusters are present per mol of enzyme. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the o-CP dehalogenase purified from D. dehalogenans was determined and revealed the sequence NH2-AETMNYVPGPTNARSKLRPVHDFA. A 59-bp 256-fold degenerated oligonucleotide (BG 444) was designed based on the sequence of the first 20 N-terminal amino acids. Southern blot analysis of EcoRI–HindIII-digested chromosomal DNA of D. dehalogenans revealed a 2.7-kilobase fragment that hybridized strongly to radiolabeled BG 444. This fragment was cloned inE. coli using EcoRI–HindIII-digested pUC18, resulting in pLUW910. Sequence analysis of theHindIII–HincII 1.8-kilobase fragment of pLUW910 revealed the determined N-terminal amino acids immediately downstream of the HindIII site, indicating that pLUW 910 lacks the translation start of the gene of interest. Therefore, the divergent primer pair BG 458/BG 475 was used to specifically amplify the pLUW910 upstream flanking fragment in an inverse PCR fromHincII-digested chromosomal DNA. To ensure determination of the correct nucleotide sequence, three independently obtained PCR products were cloned yielding pLUW912a-c. From these, HincII deletion clones were prepared, giving the corresponding pLUW913a-c. Fig. 2 shows a restriction map of the DNA region cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of two closely linked open reading frames, namelycprB (nucleotides 194–505) and cprA (nucleotides 518–1861). A third open reading frame, ORF1, starts at nucleotide 1958. Preceding each of the three open reading frames, potential Shine Dalgarno sequences were found (data not shown). The predicted gene product of cprA is a polypeptide of 447 amino acids with a molecular mass of 49,720 Da. The first 42 N-terminal residues of CprA comprise a leader sequence that is cleaved off upon maturation of the protein, leaving a mature 405-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 45,305 Da. The leader sequence contains an RR motif characteristic for a large number of mainly periplasmic proteins binding different redox cofactors (28Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). These twin arginine signal sequences (consensus (S/T)RRXFLK) are thought to play a major role in the maturation and translocation of such proteins. As all twin arginine signal sequences, the CprA leader sequence shows the structural characteristics of standard Sec signal sequences. Furthermore, the established cleavage site -VANA↓AETM- follows the “−1/−3 rule” of von Heijne (29von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The D. dehalogenans CprA sequence reveals the presence of an extended cluster of cysteine residues (Cys330–Cys387, Fig.3). The first group of four cysteines Cys330–Cys340 is identical to the consensus sequence of bacterial ferredoxin type clusters (CXXCXXCXXXCP; Ref. 30Bruschi M. Guerlesquin F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 4: 155-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including the conserved proline at position 341. The second cluster shows the same conserved residues (Cys380–Pro388) but lacks the first cysteine. The B12 binding motif DXHXXG-(41)-SxL-(26–28)-GG, as it was determined for a subset of B12-dependent enzymes (31Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), is not present in CprA. Upstream of cprA, a second potential gene, cprB, was found, that could encode a 103-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 11,517 Da. The predicted cprBgene product does not exhibit significant similarities with any known proteins present in the data bases. A hydrophilicity plot indicates the presence of three membrane-spanning helices (Fig.4). Following the positive-inside rule for integral membrane proteins (32von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), the N terminus of this polypeptide is predicted to point outward, whereas the C-terminal part is located at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. CprB andcprA are separated by only 12 nucleotides. Neither transcription termination nor initiation signals are present between the two genes. Preliminary experiments suggest co-transcription of both genes (data not shown). Cobalt in biological systems occurs in oxidation states 3+, 2+, and 1+. Only the Co2+ 3d7-system is half-integer spin and, therefore, readily detectable in EPR spectroscopy. In cobalamin, the Co2+ is low spinS = 1/2. The EPR of D. dehalogenans o-CP dehalogenase, as isolated, exhibits a signal characteristic for Cob(II)alamin in the base-off form and a weak, near isotropic,S = 1/2 signal around g = 2 indicative of [3Fe-4S] (see below). Previously, it was found that full chemical reduction of another reductive dehalogenase, the PCE reductase from D. restrictus, could not be achieved with dithionite (4Schumacher W. Holliger C. Zehnder A.J.B. Hagen W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the light-induced strongly reducing system of deazaflavin plus EDTA. Prolonged illumination resulted in a clear EPR spectrum that is dominated by a signal with g values of 2.05, 1.93, and 1.87, typical for reduced [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters (Fig.5, trace A). The signal rapidly broadens above 20 K, which indicates that its origin is a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster. Cob(II)alamin in the base-on form is present as a minor component in trace A, while the base-off form of Cob(II)alamin is fully reduced. When the enzyme is anaerobically hand-mixed with the substrate Cl-OHPA and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen (i.e. a reaction time of ∼0.5 min), another spectrum is obtained (Fig. 5,trace B). This is the signal of the base-off form of Cob(II)alamin (4Schumacher W. Holliger C. Zehnder A.J.B. Hagen W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The signal is essentially identical to that obtained from enzyme as isolated. In a control experiment where water, flushed with nitrogen gas, was added to a reduced o-CP dehalogenase sample, no base-off cobalamin signal developed. The addition of an excess of ferricyanide did not affect the signal, and this indicated an unusually high oxidation potential for the Co(II/III) couple, as previously found for the D. restrictusdehalogenase (4Schumacher W. Holliger C. Zehnder A.J.B. Hagen W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Estimation of the spin-Hamiltonian parameters by simulation gives g values of 1.99, 2.35, and 2.35 and cobalt hyperfine (I = 7/2) values of 14, 7.5, and 7.5 millitesla. These values are close to those found for the dehalogenase from D. restrictus (4Schumacher W. Holliger C. Zehnder A.J.B. Hagen W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The simulation indicates furthermore that the spectrum contains a minor second component, namely a base-on form of Cob(II)alamin; this form is also detectable as a minor component in trace A. Upon incubation with excess potassium ferricyanide, the Co2+ signal is still present at maximal amplitude, but it is now hardly discernible, since the gain has been reduced for the observation of a near isotropic signal around g = 2 typical for a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster (Fig. 5, trace C). The broad peak at low field is the gz from excess [Fe(CN)6]3+. All three signals, the [4Fe-4S]1+ signal, the Cob(II)alamin signal, and the [3Fe-4S]1+ signal, integrate to approximately the same value, corresponding to a spin count close to 1 spin per 48-kDa monomer. The signals behave as expected in reductive (dithionite) and oxidative (ferricyanide) bulk redox titrations in the presence of a mixture of redox mediators (Fig. 6); in an oxidative titration, the signal ascribed to a [3Fe-4S] cluster appears with an oxidation potential of E m,7.8= +70 mV; in a reductive titration the Co2+ signal disappears with a reduction potential of E m,7.8= −370 mV; and the signal from the [4Fe-4S] cluster appears withE m,7.8= −440 mV. TheE m values for Co(II) and [4Fe-4S] are similar to those found for the D. restrictus dehalogenase. However, that enzyme contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters (4Schumacher W. Holliger C. Zehnder A.J.B. Hagen W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The EPR of the present D. dehalogenans enzyme strongly suggests the presence of one [4Fe-4S] and one [3Fe-4S] cluster, consistent with sequence analysis (see above). ortho-Chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase is the terminal reductase involved in the halorespiratory chain of D. dehalogenans. Here we describe the purification and molecular characterization of this key enzyme and its gene cprA. This membrane-associated enzyme mediates the electron transfer from a yet unidentified electron donor to the halogenated substrate. The substrate spectrum of the purified enzyme was similar to that reported for resting cells, indicating that a single enzyme is involved in dehalogenation of ortho-halogenated phenols (Ref. 10Utkin I. Dalton D.D. Wiegel J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 346-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, TableII). The purified o-CP dehalogenase contains one [4Fe-4S] cluster, one [3Fe-4S] cluster, and one cobalamin per monomer. The presence of two iron-sulfur clusters was confirmed by the identification of one ferredoxin-like and one truncated iron-sulfur cluster binding motif (Fig. 3) in the sequence of CprA. These iron-sulfur clusters might be involved in the electron transfer to the active site that contains the cobalamin. The primary sequence alignment of CprA with PceA, the PCE reductive dehalogenase of D. multivorans (3Neumann A. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4140-4145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), revealed a rather high degree of similarity on the amino acid level in the C-terminal part of both enzymes (Fig. 3). In PceA, the same two iron-sulfur cluster binding motifs are present, indicating a conserved mode of intramolecular transport of electrons. Both reductive dehalogenases probably differ in iron-sulfur cluster contents from the PCE reductase isolated from D. restrictus, where two [4Fe-4S] clusters were identified (4Schumacher W. Holliger C. Zehnder A.J.B. Hagen W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the case of the 47-kDa Cl-OHPA reductive dehalogenase of the closely relatedDesulfitobacterium hafniense, the presence of three iron-sulfur clusters has been reported (8Christiansen N. Ahring B.K. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, more sequence information on both the enzymes from D. restrictus andD. hafniense is not yet available. The formation of Co(II) in base-off conformation upon the addition of Cl-OHPA to light-reduced o-CP dehalogenase confirms the involvement of the cobalamin in the dechlorination reaction. PCE reductase from D. restrictus, which converts PCE via TCE to 1,2-cis-dichloroethene, also contains cobalamin (E m = −350 mV) in its base-off conformation (4Schumacher W. Holliger C. Zehnder A.J.B. Hagen W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism could account for both chlorophenol and PCE dechlorination, although PCE is not a substrate for o-CP dehalogenase and D. restrictus is not capable of dechlorinating chlorophenols. The cprA gene encodes a proprotein, in which the mature polypeptides is proceeded by a twin arginine-type signal sequence characteristic for periplasmic enzymes containing complex redox cofactors. A similar leader sequence is present in thepceA gene product. For both dehalogenases, it has been proposed by dye-mediated activity measurements in intact and broken cells that the dehalogenating activities are located at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane (data not shown; Ref. 3Neumann A. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4140-4145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The only othertwin arginine enzyme with similar contradictory results concerns the E. coli Me2SO reductase (28Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 33Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Turner R.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Additional experiments will be required to solve the topology of these enzymes. Elucidation of the nucleotide sequences upstream and downstream ofcprA revealed the presence of a second potential gene,cprB. The hydrophobic gene product, CprB, might have a role in anchoring the catalytic subunit of the o-CP reductive dehalogenase to the cytoplasmic membrane. A similar function has been proposed for PceB in D. multivorans (3Neumann A. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4140-4145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although CprA and PceA exhibit highly conserved boxes, both primary sequences lack the consensus sequence for the binding of the corrinoid cofactor conserved among several methylcobalamin-dependent methyltransferases and mutases (31Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The role of cobalamin in the reductive dehalogenases from chlorophenol and PCE-degrading organisms is of special interest, since it does not mediate the “usual rearrangement” or alkyl transfer but an elimination reaction (31Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 269-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed for the reaction mechanism of PCE reductive dehalogenation. One model involves the formation of a Co(III)–chloroethene carbon–metal bond (2Neumann A. Wohlfarth G. Diekert G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16515-16519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), whereas the second model postulates the formation of a chloroethene radical (4Schumacher W. Holliger C. Zehnder A.J.B. Hagen W.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, neither of these intermediates has been demonstrated unequivocally for PCE reductive dehalogenases. Based on our data, it is not possible to determine which model applies forortho-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase from D. dehalogenans. On one hand, an essential intermediate in the first model, Cob(III)alamin, was not formed upon oxidation of the enzyme. On the other hand, there was no radical formation upon the addition of substrate to the reduced enzyme. The latter could be due to the slow reaction time, which makes it difficult to detect a reactive compound such as a phenol radical. Additional experiments are required in which the supposed radical would be stabilized. The similarities between the o-chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase of D. dehalogenans and the PCE reductive dehalogenases of Dehalospirillum multivorans andDehalobacter restrictus on both mechanistic and structural properties as well as their primary sequences suggest that these enzymes constitute a novel class of corrinoid-containing reductases."
https://openalex.org/W2132210046,"The balance between the concentrations of free ionized Ca2+ and bicarbonate in pancreatic juice is of critical importance in preventing the formation of calcium carbonate stones. How the pancreas regulates the ionic composition and the level of Ca2+ saturation in an alkaline environment such as the pancreatic juice is not known. Because of the tight cause-effect relationship between Ca2+ concentration and lithogenicity, and because hypercalcemia is proposed as an etiologic factor for several pancreatic diseases, we have investigated whether pancreatic tissues express a Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) similar to that recently identified in parathyroid tissue. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate the presence of a CaR-like molecule in rat pancreatic acinar cells, pancreatic ducts, and islets of Langerhans. Functional studies, in which intracellular free Ca2+concentration was measured in isolated acinar cells and interlobular ducts, show that both cell types are responsive to the CaR agonist gadolinium (Gd3+) and to changes in extracellular Ca2+ concentration. We also assessed the effects of CaR stimulation on physiological HCO3−secretion from ducts by making measurements of intracellular pH. Luminal Gd3+ is a potent stimulus for HCO3− secretion, being equally as effective as raising intracellular cAMP with forskolin. These results suggest that the CaR in the exocrine pancreas monitors the Ca2+ concentration in the pancreatic juice, and might therefore be involved in regulating the level of Ca2+ in the lumen, both under basal conditions and during hormonal stimulation. The failure of this mechanism might lead to pancreatic stone formation and even to pancreatitis. The balance between the concentrations of free ionized Ca2+ and bicarbonate in pancreatic juice is of critical importance in preventing the formation of calcium carbonate stones. How the pancreas regulates the ionic composition and the level of Ca2+ saturation in an alkaline environment such as the pancreatic juice is not known. Because of the tight cause-effect relationship between Ca2+ concentration and lithogenicity, and because hypercalcemia is proposed as an etiologic factor for several pancreatic diseases, we have investigated whether pancreatic tissues express a Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) similar to that recently identified in parathyroid tissue.

The failure of this mechanism might lead to pancreatic stone formation and even to pancreatitis. Pancreatic juice in humans and other species is an alkaline secretion, containing up to 140 mm bicarbonate ions (1Marteau C. Blanc G. Devaux M.A. Portugal H. Gerolami A. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1993; 38: 2090-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The juice also contains millimolar quantities of Ca2+ ions, which are released from secretory granules along with pancreatic zymogens (1Marteau C. Blanc G. Devaux M.A. Portugal H. Gerolami A. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1993; 38: 2090-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The presence of these ions means that the pancreatic juice is at risk of precipitating calcium stones, which are a major cause of chronic pancreatitis (1Marteau C. Blanc G. Devaux M.A. Portugal H. Gerolami A. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1993; 38: 2090-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This is especially true when the residence time of the juice within the ductal compartment is increased,i.e. at low pancreatic secretory rates. Because the incidence of pancreatic stone formation is surprisingly low, it has been postulated that homeostatic responses must be activated to reduce lithogenic potential. A number of suggestions have been advanced for candidate mechanisms, all within the ductal system, including increased H+ and fluid secretion and a reduction in bicarbonate production (1Marteau C. Blanc G. Devaux M.A. Portugal H. Gerolami A. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1993; 38: 2090-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, thus far there is no direct experimental evidence for any of these hypotheses, and the question of how the pH and the free Ca2+ concentration in pancreatic juice are regulated is yet to be understood. Recently Brown et al. (2Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar) have identified a cell-surface, G protein-linked Ca2+(polyvalent cation)-sensing receptor (CaR) 1The abbreviations CaRCa2+-sensing receptorRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactionCCKcholecystokininDIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidBCECF2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein which is capable of monitoring even minute changes in extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]o) and responds with an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The receptor is sensitive to changes in [Ca2+]oin the millimolar range, compatible with [Ca2+]oin the plasma. Intriguingly, the concentration of freeionized Ca2+ in human pancreatic juice under conditions of basal secretion has been estimated to be ∼1 mm (1Marteau C. Blanc G. Devaux M.A. Portugal H. Gerolami A. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1993; 38: 2090-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Since hypercalcemia stimulates pancreatic secretion (3Layer P. Hotz J. Goebell H. Pancreas. 1986; 1: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and is associated with pathological effects including acinar and ductal cell necrosis, formation of intraductal precipitates, and clinical pancreatitis (3Layer P.

Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 239-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that a CaR-like mechanism was also expressed in the rat exocrine pancreas. Ca2+-sensing receptor reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction cholecystokinin 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein Reverse-transcriptase PCR on total rat pancreas mRNA, using intron-spanning primers, established the presence of CaR-like transcripts, and immunological localization of CaR protein employing an anti-CaR polyclonal antiserum revealed strong immunoreactivity at the luminal side of pancreatic ducts and a more diffuse, cellular and basolateral staining pattern in acinar cells. The receptor is also strongly expressed in clusters of cells representing the islets of Langerhans. Functional studies in isolated pancreatic acinar cells, and in microperfused interlobular ducts, using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura-2 showed that the CaR agonists [Ca2+]o and Gd3+ raised [Ca2+]i in both acini and ducts. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that the CaR might play a role in regulating ductal HCO3− secretion. Luminal microperfusion of Gd3+ resulted in enhanced ductal HCO3− secretion, comparable to that evoked by the secretagogue forskolin (7Steward M.C. Lang T.F. Yang X.-S. San Roman J.I. Varga G. Case R.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 23-24Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that the CaR in the pancreas plays a significant role in the regulation of pancreatic juice secretion, in particular by constantly monitoring the level of free Ca2+ in secreted fluid within the acinar and duct lumen. Alterations of receptor function could help explain how ion sensing by the exocrine pancreas can go awry, resulting in pancreatic stone formation and acute pancreatitis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 100 and 300 g were killed by cervical dislocation. The pancreas was removed, frozen immediately in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNA was extracted using the guanidinium thiocyanate/acid phenol method (8Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). First strand DNA was synthesized from 1 to 2 μg of total RNA using Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the resultant first-strand DNA was then used for PCR amplification. In order to perform “hot start” PCR, the Taq DNA polymerase was added during the initial 3-min denaturation, followed by 35 cycles of amplification (1 min denaturation at 92 °C, 30 s annealing at 47 °C, and 1 min extension at 72 °C), with final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. The 383 base pairs expected PCR product was visualized with ethidium bromide after electrophoretic separation on a 1% agarose gel, and the specificity of the PCR reaction was assessed by high stringency Southern blotting using a 32P-labeled 3.2-kilobaseXhoI-ApaI fragment corresponding to the coding region of the rat kidney CaR (9Riccardi D. Lee W.-S. Lee K. Segre G.V. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F951-F956PubMed Google Scholar, 10Riccardi D. Park J. Lee W.-S. Gamba G. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), as described elsewhere (9Riccardi D. Lee W.-S. Lee K. Segre G.V. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F951-F956PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid genomic DNA amplification, the primer sequences were based on the known rat CaR sequence (10Riccardi D. Park J. Lee W.-S. Gamba G. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and were designed to span one intron: forward primer, 5′- ACCTTTACCTGTCCCCTGAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′- GGGCAACAAAACTCAAGGTG-3′. As negative and positive controls the DNA template was replaced with an equivalent volume of water and with an equivalent amount of total RNA reverse-transcribed from rat kidney, respectively. CaR polyclonal antibodies raised against a 20-amino acid sequence in the predicted hydrophilic amino-terminal region of the bovine CaR (11Riccardi D. Hall A.E. Chattopadhyay N. Xu J.Z. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 274: F611-F622Google Scholar) were generously provided by Drs. S. C. Hebert (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) and by Dr. E. M. Brown (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Prior to use, the antibodies were purified using an affinity column conjugated with the antigenic peptide (11Riccardi D. Hall A.E. Chattopadhyay N. Xu J.Z. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 274: F611-F622Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry in pancreatic sections, rats were killed by cervical dislocation and the pancreas perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The pancreas was then isolated, post-fixed for 5 min, and snap-frozen by immersing it inN-methylbutane using standard embedding medium (OCT compound) as mounting medium. Four micron-thick cryosections were cut using a Leica CM3050 cryostat (Leica, Nussloch, Germany) and processed as described elsewhere (11Riccardi D. Hall A.E. Chattopadhyay N. Xu J.Z. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 274: F611-F622Google Scholar). The intensity of immunostaining was enhanced using an antigen-retrieval protocol employing citrate buffer (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (12Brown D. Lydon J. McLaughlin M. Stuart-Tilley A. Tyszkowski R. Alper S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding of proteins was prevented with the DAKO serum-free protein block reagent (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA). Staining was performed using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DAKO LSAB 2 Kit, HRP) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The affinity-purified anti-CaR polyclonal antibody was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 3% (v/v) normal goat serum and applied at a 1:400 dilution with an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Negative control (preabsorption of the antibody with 5 μg/ml of the antigenic peptide prior to incubation) was performed under the same conditions. For examination of CaR immunoreactivity in isolated pancreatic ducts we utilized single interlobular ducts isolated as described below for [Ca2+]i experiments (n = 23 ducts from 3 rats). Each individual duct was partly split open and acetone-fixed for 10 min. Positive and negative CaR immunoreactivity was tested as described above, except that the antigen retrieval protocol was omitted. Fluorescent secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with rhodamine red, Jackson Immunochemicals, Luton, Beds, United Kingdom) diluted 1:200 was added and the sections incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Both horseradish peroxidase-stained whole pancreas sections and fluorescently stained single isolated ducts were visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and images were acquired using a digital camera (Photonic Science, Cambridge, UK) using the Openlab software package (Improvision, Coventry, UK). Small clusters of rat pancreatic acinar cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion of the pancreas with collagenase as described previously (13Speake T. Elliott A.E. J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 415-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27764-27770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), except that all media contained a reduced concentration of CaCl2 (0.5 mm). This value, which is less than half the physiological concentration, was selected to avoid possible activation of CaRs, which is known to occur at [Ca2+] concentrations of 1 mm and above (2Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). Following isolation, the cells were resuspended in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline (pH 7.4) containing (mm): 104 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 25 HEPES, 15 glucose, 2 l-glutamine. The solution was supplemented with 2% (v/v) minimal essential medium amino acids, 0.12 mg ml−1 trypsin inhibitor (type II-S, Sigma) and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma). This cell suspension was either used immediately or maintained on ice and top-gassed with 100% O2 until use. Acinar cells were loaded with 4 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 40 min at room temperature, and then transferred to a perfusion chamber as described previously (14van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27764-27770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Once cells had adhered to the chamber base they were continuously superfused with HEPES-buffered physiological saline from a gravity-fed perfusion system at a rate of 2 ml min−1. Fluorescence in a field of up to 30 acinar cells was imaged using a Nikon Diaphot microscope and a slow-scan CCD camera (Digital Pixel Ltd, Brighton, UK) as described previously in detail (14van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27764-27770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Background-subtracted 340:380 images were calculated off-line and used to generate records of the 340:380 ratio in each of the individual acinar cells within the microscope field. The composition of the physiological saline used in acinar cell imaging experiments was similar to that in the isolation procedure, but omitting amino acids, glutamine, trypsin inhibitor, and bovine serum albumin. In addition, SO42− and HPO42− ions were replaced with Cl− in experiments employing gadolinium and high [Ca2+]o in order to prevent precipitation of insoluble gadolinium or calcium salts. In most experiments, CaCl2 was reduced to 0.1 mm to prevent possible activation of the CaR. Preliminary experiments established that 0.1 mm CaCl2 was the minimum necessary to maintain [Ca2+]i oscillations evoked by the physiological secretory agonist cholecystokinin (CCK). As an index of viability only cells which responded to 50 pm CCK were utilized. All solutions and experimental media were equilibrated with 100% O2 and all experiments were carried out at room temperature. Interlobular ducts were prepared as described previously (15Ishiguro H. Steward M.C. Lindsay A.R.G. Case R.M. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Animals were killed by cervical dislocation, the body and tail of the pancreas were removed and injected with a digestion buffer consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK) supplemented with 80 units ml−1 collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ), 400 units ml−1 hyaluronidase (Sigma), 0.2 mg ml−1 soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The tissue was chopped coarsely with scissors into approximately 1-mm3 pieces, gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2 and incubated at 37 °C for 35 min and then in fresh digestion buffer for a further 30 min. The digested tissue was washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2 mg ml−1 soybean trypsin inhibitor and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Interlobular ducts (diameter 100–130 μm) were microdissected from samples of this tissue suspension under a dissection microscope using sharpened needles. The ducts were then placed on polycarbonate membrane filters (Cyclopore) floating on McCoy's 5A tissue culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mg ml−1soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 IU ml−1 insulin and 4 μg ml−1 dexamethasone, and were cultured at 37 °C in 95% O2, 5% CO2 for up to 24 h, during which time the ends of the ducts seal spontaneously. After overnight culture, the ends of a duct were cut open using sharpened needles and the duct was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in HEPES-buffered saline containing either 5 μm Fura-2/AM (for measurements of [Ca2+]i) or 1 μm BCECF/AM (for measurements of intracellular pH). The duct was then transferred to a perfusion chamber (volume 200 μl) mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope for simultaneous luminal microperfusion and measurement of [Ca2+]i. The duct was gently aspirated into a holding pipette (tip diameter 50–80 μm), and a perfusion pipette (tip diameter 10 μm) was then advanced into the duct lumen for luminal perfusion. The other end of the duct was attached to the surface of the glass coverslip, which formed the bottom of the perfusion chamber. The duct lumen was then perfused at a flow rate of 10–20 μl/min, while the chamber was perfused at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min. Duct cell [Ca2+]i or intracellular pH (pHi) was estimated by dual-excitation wavelength microfluorometry as described previously (15Ishiguro H. Steward M.C. Lindsay A.R.G. Case R.M. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Ashton N. Evans R.L. Elliott A.C. Green R. Argent B.E. J. Physiol. 1993; 471: 549-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An optical diaphragm in the emitted light path limited fluorescence collection to a small region of the ductal epithelium (10–20 cells). Records of [Ca2+]i are displayed as the uncalibrated Fura-2 fluorescence ratio, while records of pHi were calibrated using nigericin/high [K+]o (15Ishiguro H. Steward M.C. Lindsay A.R.G. Case R.M. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HEPES-buffered perfusion fluid used in experiments measuring [Ca2+]i in isolated ducts contained (mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES, and was equilibrated with 100% O2. When the perfusate contained 0.5, 5, or 8 mm Ca2+, NaCl concentration was reduced appropriately to maintain isosmolarity. All HEPES-buffered solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4 at 37 °C. For experiments assessing ductal HCO3−secretion, the bath was perfused with a medium containing 25 mm HCO3− (replacing Cl−) and equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 to give a pH of 7.4, while the lumen was perfused with the HEPES-buffered perfusion fluid described above. Reverse transcription and PCR amplification was carried out on total mRNA from rat pancreas and rat kidney as positive control. Using CaR-specific primers, we were able to amplify a product of the expected size (383 base pairs) for the CaR from both samples. High-stringency Southern analysis using a 32P-labeled CaR-specific cDNA probe (9Riccardi D. Lee W.-S. Lee K. Segre G.V. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F951-F956PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed that the 383-base pair amplified PCR products were genuine CaR transcripts (Fig.1, arrow). No products were detected when DNA was replaced with water in the PCR reaction (Fig.1). In order to identify which cells in the rat pancreas expressed the CaR, we carried out immunolocalization with an affinity-purified anti-CaR polyclonal antibody raised against the bovine parathyroid CaR (11Riccardi D. Hall A.E. Chattopadhyay N. Xu J.Z. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 274: F611-F622Google Scholar). Light microscope images (Fig. 2) revealed that specific CaR immunoreactivity, visualized using peroxidase staining, was present in ducts, acini, and also in cells within the islets of Langerhans. Similar results were also seen when a fluorophore-coupled, rather than horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, secondary antibody was used (data not shown). No signal was detected when the primary antibody was preincubated with the antigenic peptide (Fig. 2 A). Distinct staining patterns were observed in the different cell types. A punctate-like staining clearly above background was observed in groups of acinar cells (Fig. 2, B-D), with a rather heterogeneous intensity. At higher magnification (Fig.2 D) the staining seemed to be localized at the basolateral membrane and/or intracellularly in the acinar cells, although apical staining was also visible. An intense signal was detected in the islet of Langerhans, predominantly at the periphery of the islets, so that the staining clearly delimited the islets (Fig. 2 C). Fig.2 C also shows strong CaR immunoreactivity in an interlobular duct (arrow). The intensity of the staining observed in acinar cells was clearly weaker than in both islet of Langerhans and duct cells (Fig. 2 C), suggesting a reduced expression of the CaR in acinar cells relative to the other two cell types. Since unambiguous identification of ducts in tissue sections was often difficult, we went on to define the subcellular localization of the CaR in the same isolated interlobular duct preparation used for functional studies. As shown in Fig. 2 F, a strong immunofluorescence signal was observed inside the ducts, representing the luminal membrane of the duct cells. In order to test whether acinar cells express a functional CaR, we stimulated fura-2-loaded acinar cells with CaR agonists. Initially we tested 1 mm Gd3+, which produced changes in [Ca2+]i when applied either before or after stimulation with 50 pm CCK. Treatment with 1 mmGd3+ after CCK stimulation triggered responses in approximately half (53%) of the acinar cells tested, with a range of response profiles being observed (Fig.3). A rapid and irreversible increase in [Ca2+]i was evoked in 6% of cells (Fig.3 A), a large transient increase in [Ca2+]i in 9% of cells (Fig. 3B), oscillations in [Ca2+]i in 31% of cells (Fig. 3 C), and a slow rise in [Ca2+]i in 7% of cells (Fig.3 D). Finally, no change in [Ca2+]i was detected in 47% of cells (Fig. 3 E; all data derived from a total of 93 cells from 4 rats). Treatment with 1 mm Gd3+ prior to CCK stimulation caused a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i in 18% of cells, oscillations in [Ca2+]i in 31%, a slow rise in [Ca2+]i in 25%, and no change [Ca2+]i in 25% of cells (all valuesn = 83 cells from 3 rats). The smaller percentage of cells showing no response to Gd3+, as compared with cells stimulated with Gd3+ after CCK treatment, suggests that cells were slightly more sensitive to Gd3+ when treated prior to CCK stimulation. We also treated cells with a lower concentration of 600 μm Gd3+, typically the maximum concentration which has been used in heterologous expression systems (e.g. Xenopus laevis oocytes and human embryonic kidney cells (see Ref. 2Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar for review). Somewhat to our surprise, this failed to produce any change in [Ca2+]i. We went on to test acinar cells with the physiological agonist of the CaR by examining the effects of raising [Ca2+]o from 0.1 to 8 mm(Fig. 4). This produced a variety of changes in [Ca2+]i. However, the pattern of changes was noticeably different from the profile of responses observed with Gd3+ (Fig. 3). Only 20% of cells produced oscillations in [Ca2+]i, and the oscillations were superimposed over a slowly rising baseline (Fig. 4 A), which did not occur with Gd2+ (compare Fig. 3). In 16% of cells a transient increase in [Ca2+]i was observed (Fig. 4 B). However, the kinetics of this change in [Ca2+]i were different from the equivalent Gd3+-evoked response (Fig. 3 B) as a much slower increase was observed with high [Ca2+]o. A slow and smaller increase in [Ca2+]i, which continued throughout the exposure to 8 mm[Ca2+]o, was observed in 17% of cells (Fig.4 C) while 47% of cells failed to produce a response (Fig.4 D; n = 140 cells, 5 rats). Overall, it was clear that fewer cells showed typical receptor-mediated responses when stimulated with elevated [Ca2+]o than when stimulated with Gd3+. In fact the predominant response seemed to be a slow increase in baseline [Ca2+]i, seen in around 50% of cells, which is suggestive of increased Ca2+ entry. Finally, we tested the polycationic antibiotic neomycin (500 μm and 1 mm), another known CaR agonist (2Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). In our hands neomycin failed to produce any change in [Ca2+]i in all acinar cells tested (n = 48 cells from two rats for 500 μmneomycin, 156 cells from six rats for 1 mm) (not shown). We examined the effects of Gd3+ on interlobular ducts with the same experimental protocol used to test for CaR expression in studies on heterologous expression systems (2Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). In this protocol Gd3+ is applied in the absence of all other divalent cations (i.e. in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+). We first performed preliminary experiments to ensure the viability of the isolated ducts in the absence of divalent cations. This was achieved by perfusing both bath and lumen with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free solution for at least 10 min and then testing duct viability by the response to bath application of 10 μm acetylcholine (ACh, not shown). Having established that the ducts remained viable in the absence of divalent cations, we determined the functional localization of the CaR (apical versus basolateral). Ducts were challenged with 600 μm Gd3+ using three different approaches: simultaneous luminal and bath perfusion, luminal perfusion only, or basolateral perfusion only. In all experiments we could only detect changes in [Ca2+]i when Gd3+ was applied luminally (n = 31 ducts from four rats). Bath perfusion with Gd3+ failed to produce an increase in [Ca2+]i (n = 8 ducts from four rats). Under these conditions, all of the ducts tested responded to luminal Gd3+ with an increase in [Ca2+]i. Fig. 5 shows a representative response, in which [Ca2+]i slowly increased when Gd3+ was added to the luminal solution. Little or no recovery of [Ca2+]i was observed on removal of Gd3+ in this experiment. This was typical of 23 out of 31 ducts. Recovery to baseline after Gd3+ stimulation was observed in only 26% of responses (n = 8 ducts from four rats; not shown). We went on to challenge ducts with high concentrations of [Ca2+]o (5 or 8 mm). In initial experiments a slow increase in [Ca2+]i was seen on raising [Ca2+]o in either the bath or the luminal perfusate (not shown). The effects of bath [Ca2+]o on [Ca2+]i have been previously reported (16Ashton N. Evans R.L. Elliott A.C. Green R. Argent B.E. J.

https://openalex.org/W2067839271,"Cubilin, the receptor for intrinsic factor-vitamin B12, is a novel type of high molecular weight receptor consisting of a 27 CUB (complement components C1r/C1s, Uegf, and bone morphogenic protein-1) domain cluster preceded by 8 epidermal growth factor repeats and a short N-terminal sequence. In addition to binding the vitamin B12-carrier complex, cubilin also binds receptor-associated protein. To delineate the structures for membrane association and ligand binding we established a panel of stable transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing overlapping segments of rat cubilin. Analysis of conditioned media and cell extracts of transfected cells revealed that the N-terminal cubilin region conveys membrane association. Helical plotting of this region demonstrated a conserved amphipathic helix pattern (Lys74–Glu109) as a candidate site for hydrophobic interactions. Ligand affinity chromatography and surface plasmon resonance analysis of the secreted cubilin fragments showed ligand binding in the CUB domain region. Further dissection of binding-active fragments localized the binding site for intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 to CUB domains 5–8 and a receptor-associated protein-binding site to CUB domains 13–14. In conclusion, the N-terminal cubilin region seems crucial for membrane association, whereas the CUB domain cluster harbors distinct sites for ligand binding.

No classical transmembrane segment has been predicted, and the overall structure is distinct from known endocytic receptors, including the RAP-binding members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family (15Gliemann J.

Two mutations, one causing a Pro/Leu substitution in CUB domain 8 and another suggested to activate an intronic cryptic splice site leading to truncation of the receptor in CUB domain 6, have recently been identified in the cubilin gene of patients with inherited B12 malabsorption (11Aminoff M.

To link the structural and functional features of cubilin, we established a comprehensive panel of transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing various segments of the receptor. Biochemical analyses of the cells and expression products now delineate the regions important for membrane association and binding of IF-B12and RAP. Porcine and human IF-B12were purified from gastric mucosa extract as described (16Nexø E. Olesen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 446: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Human RAP was produced as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. Rabbit cubilin was purified from renal cortex by IF-B12 and RAP affinity chromatography, as described previously (5Birn H.

Cubilin cDNA fragments extended with enzyme restriction sites were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the ExpandTM High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and purified with the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, CA). The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the expression vector (pSecTag2B or pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−) from Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) by use of the appropriate restriction enzymes (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the T4 DNA ligase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmids were transformed using XL1-Blue competent cells (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA), and plasmid DNA was isolated by the Qiagen Maxiprep method (Qiagen) and sequenced before transfection as described previously (13Moestrup S.K.

The rat cubilin constructs were expressed by using the pSecTag2B vector except for the two constructs,N-EGF1–8 (variant b) and N-EGF1–8+CUB1–3,which were expressed by using the pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−) vector. The pSecTag2B vector encodes the murine Ig κ chain leader sequence, which was used as leader peptide for protein secretion in these vector constructs, whereas the leader peptide of cubilin was used as leader sequence in the pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−) vector constructs. CHO K-1 cells were transfected by using DOSPER liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and stable transfected CHO clones were established by limited dilution and selection with 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Clones were grown in serum-free medium for CHO cells (HyQ-CCM®5 from HyClone®, Logan, Utah) with 300 μg/ml Zeocin. Cells were lysed in a solution of 10 mmNaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100 (Merck), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), pH 7.4. Secretion of the recombinant rat cubilin fragments was analyzed by Western blotting of growth medium and cell lysate using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat cubilin (5Birn H. Verroust P.J.

The expressed CUB5–8 and CUB7–14constructs were purified from the conditioned medium by IF-B12 and RAP affinity chromatography, respectively, as described previously for cubilin purification (5Birn H.

Immunofluorescence analysis of CHO cells expressing the EGF cluster with and without the preceding N-terminal region (N-EGF1–8 and EGF1–8, respectively) was performed on cells fixed in formaldehyde, washed with an isotonic Tris-NaCl solution with 0.05% Triton X-100, and incubated with a polyclonal antibody against rat cubilin. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by use of fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-rabbit Ig (DAKO A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). The conditioned medium of the transfected cells secreting cubilin fragments into the medium were incubated with CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled with porcine IF-B12 or human recombinant RAP (1–5 mg/ml gel). Beads were washed with a solution of 10 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.6 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, before and after incubation with medium containing the fragments. Supernatants were removed upon centrifugation at 5000 × g for 2 min. Larger scale purification of the CUB1–8 andCUB5–8 constructs from conditioned media was carried out by IF-B12 affinity chromatography (5Birn H. Verroust P.J. Nexø E. Hager H. Jacobsen C. Christensen E.I. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whereas theCUB7–14 and CUB13–20 constructs were purified by RAP affinity chromatography (5Birn H.

SPR analysis of the binding of IF-B12 (human and porcine) and human RAP on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out essentially as described (5Birn H. Verroust P.J.

The BIAcore sensor chips (type CM5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.2m N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccimide in water. Proteins were immobilized at a concentration of up to 40 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and the remaining binding sites were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The surface plasmon resonance signal generated from immobilized cubilin and cubilin fragments corresponded to 30–80 fmol of receptor/mm2. The flow cells were regenerated with 1.6m glycine-HCl, pH 3. The binding data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation program version 3.0. Fig.1. shows the structural elements of cubilin and the initial strategy for mammalian expression of cubilin fragments in stable transfected CHO cells. The EGF repeat and CUB domain products were designed to overlap to ensure that the investigated binding sites that might encompass several domains were present in at least one expression product. Immunoblotting of the conditioned media from transfected cells showed an effective secretion of all expression products except for the products containing the N-terminal region (Fig.2). For example, the eight-EGF repeat region (EGF1–8 product) was effectively secreted, whereas the same region added the N-terminal cubilin region (N-EGF1–8 product) was not. Immunoblotting of solubilized transfected cell clones showed that the expression products containing the N-terminal segment were retained in the cells, whereas the expression products without this segment were virtually absent in the cells, thus indicating an immediate secretion upon synthesis. Immunofluorescense microscopy of the cells (not shown) expressing the N-terminal region indicated that the expression product was localized to the membrane and intracellular vesicles as previously reported for native cubilin in cultured yolk sac cells (13Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5235-5242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Using either the cubilin signal peptide or the murine Ig kappa chain signal peptide as the leader sequence in the construct encoding the N-terminal product (N-EGF1-8) led to cellular retention of the expressed protein. This indicates that the membrane association of the N-terminal region of cubilin is not because of membrane binding of a noncleaved leader peptide. No hydrophobic stretch similar to classical transmembrane segments has been identified in the N-terminal region of cubilin (13Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5235-5242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, helical plotting of this region of rat and human cubilin (Fig.3) predicted a conserved amphipathic helix structure encompassing aa Lys74–Glu109and Gly73–Asp108, respectively. A nearly identical cluster of 10 and 11 hydrophobic residues are located in the same side of the putative amphipathic helices of rat and human cubilin, respectively. The structure has some similarity to the A-type amphipathic helices seen in lipid-embedded regions of apolipoproteins (17Segrest J.P. De-Loof H. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Ligand affinity precipitation of the expression products displayed in Fig. 2 with IF-B12-Sepharose beads (Fig.4) revealed IF-B12 binding to the CUB1–8 product, whereas none of the other regions exhibited any binding. Because no binding was seen to theEGF1–8+CUB1–3 product, shorter segments of the CUB domains 4–8 region were expressed. The CUB5–8 product was effectively precipitated by IF-B12 beads, whereasCUB4–6 was not. These data combined with the absent IF-B12 binding to CUB7–14 indicate that the binding site for IF-B12 is localized within CUB domains 5–8 and is dependent on the structure of several domains within this region. Similar expression of human cubilin CUB domains 5–8 also revealed a binding site for IF-B12 (data not shown). Precipitation of the expression products using RAP-Sepharose beads (Fig. 5) revealed that theCUB7–14 and CUB13–20 products bind RAP. Binding of RAP to the two large CUB domain constructs may reflect RAP binding to the overlapping CUB domains 13 and 14. Expression of smaller fragments further indicated this because the CUB11–14 andCUB13–16 products bound RAP, whereas no binding was seen toCUB9–12. The expressed recombinant CUB domain regions containing the distinct sites for IF-B12 (CUB1–8 andCUB5–8) and RAP (CUB7–14 andCUB13–20) were readily purified to homogeneity by IF-B12 and RAP affinity chromatography. Figs. 6 and7 show the purification ofCUB5–8 and CUB7–14 and the ligand-fragment interactions as recorded by SPR analysis. These data further confirmed that the sites for IF-B12 and RAP are distinct. TheK d for human and porcine IF-B12 binding to CUB5–8 was ∼35 and ∼45 nm, respectively,versus ∼5 nm for the binding to native rabbit and human cubilin (Refs. 13Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R.

Fig.8 is a schematic presentation of the present mapping of functional regions in cubilin. Cubilin is a membrane protein although more loosely attached to the membrane compared with other membrane proteins (13Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5235-5242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The present expression data now indicate that the N-terminal cubilin region is crucial for membrane association. The region has no classical transmembrane segment, but helical plotting demonstrated a conserved amphipathic helix motif similar to the lipid-embedded amphipathic helix structures described in apolipoproteins (17Segrest J.P. De-Loof H. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Membrane association by means of this structure may be a hairpin-like anchoring with the extreme N-terminal end facing the noncytoplasmic environment. This will allow the N-terminal trimming by furin, the Golgi proteinase suggested to recognize cubilin and induce cleavage after the furin recognition sequence preceding Arg12 in rat cubilin (14Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Silahtaroglu A. Hansen C. Jacobsen C. Tommerup N. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 1998; 91: 3593-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the amphipathic region may be involved in the assembly of cubilin. A very recent electron microscopic study of purified bovine cubilin has shown the formation of trimers in solution without detergent and lipid (18Lindblom A. Quadt N. Marsh T. Aeschlimann D. Mörgelin M. Mann K. Maurer P. Paulsson J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6374-6380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A region of four heptad repeats, actually a part of the putative amphipathic helix structure, has been proposed to account for the assembly. Future structural studies of membrane-associated cubilin may further elucidate how the receptor is physically attached to the membrane and how it is organized there. Maybe cubilin is functionally a monomer, but when shed from the membrane, the short hydrophobic region causes self-assembly into homodimer/ homotrimers. The identification of the binding site for IF-B12 in the region encompassing CUB domains 5–8 establishes the CUB domain structure as a ligand binding domain. Although this domain has long been known as a structural entity in other membrane proteins, its biological function in these proteins is largely unknown. In view of the present mapping data, it is tempting to suggest that some other identified receptor-like membrane proteins with CUB domains, e.g. SRP-ductin (19Cheng H. Bjerknes M. Chen H. Anat. Rec. 1996; 244: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) are orphan receptors with ligands remaining to be identified. The recently determined three-dimensional CUB domain structure (20Dias J.M. Carvalho A.L. Kolln I. Calvete J.J. Topfer P.E. Varela P.F. Romero A. Urbanke C. Romao M.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) agrees well with a ligand binding function. The CUB domain is a barrel-like structure containing two layers of five-stranded β-sheets with the β-turns in a surface-exposed position as in the antigen binding regions of immunoglobulins. Furthermore, structural analysis of CUB domain dimers (21Varela P.F. Romero A. Sanz L. Romao M.J. Topfer P.E. Calvete J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggests that the dimers may associate via the β-sheet layers. If the CUB domains of cubilin are arranged in this way, on top of each other and with the β-sheets facing, it will leave the less conserved β-turns of the CUB domains available for interactions. In view of the existence of 27 CUB domains in cubilin, a high number of putative sites for various protein interactions may then be predicted. Another interesting perspective arising from the recognition of the binding site for IF-B12 in cubilin relates to the recent identification of mutations in cubilin of patients with autosomal recessive B12 malabsorption (Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome) (9Imerslund O. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1960; 49: 1-115PubMed Google Scholar, 10Grasbeck G.R. Acta Med. Scand. 1960; 167: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The two mutations identified in the human cubilin gene (11Aminoff M. Carter J.E. Chadwick R. Grasbeck R. Abdelaal M.A. Broch H. Jenner L.B. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. de la Chapelle A. Krahe R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) both relate to the critical region now known to harbor the IF-B12 binding region. The mutation, suggested to activate a cryptic intronic splice site leading to truncation of the receptor in CUB domain 6, may lead to an inactive translation product, whereas the P/L substitution in CUB domain 8 might cause a structural change specifically impairing IF-B12 binding. Further expression and mutational studies are now in progress to identify the crucial residues of the IF-B12 binding site and the structural-functional implications of this mutation in human cubilin. A site for binding of RAP was localized within CUB domains 13–14. The physiological importance of this interaction remains to be determined, but it is tempting to speculate that RAP may assist the processing/folding of cubilin in line with its suggested chaperone function and importance for normal processing of LDL receptor-related protein and megalin (22Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the RAP binding to cubilin differs from the RAP binding to other receptors in the sense that RAP is not a general inhibitor of ligand binding in cubilin. The estimated K d values for binding of IF-B12 was 6–9-fold higher than the estimated affinities of IF-B12 to native rabbit and human cubilin (12Sahali D. Mulliez N. Chatelet F. Dupuis R. Ronco P. Verroust P. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5235-5242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas the estimated K d values for binding of RAP to recombinant and native cubilin only differed about 2-fold. The lower affinity of the IF-B12 binding to CUB5–8 may be explained by the small size of the fragment making it more vulnerable to immobilization compared with full-length cubilin. Alternatively, other parts of the receptor are required for complete structural integrity of the binding site. However, the existence of other independent sites for IF-B12 binding seems unlikely in view of the absent IF-B12 binding to other expressed regions of cubilin. No specific function has yet been dedicated the cluster of EGF repeats in cubilin. Its position between the membrane-associated segment and the CUB domain region might indicate a structural role as a spacing segment for positioning the ligand binding region in an appropriate distance from the membrane. Interestingly, a similar cluster of EGF repeats is positioned between the transmembrane segment and the ligand binding regions of LDL receptor-related protein (23Herz J. Hamann V. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl M. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Neither has a function of these EGF repeats, constituting the extracellular part of the LDL receptor-related protein β-subunit, been defined apart from binding the LDL receptor-related protein α-subunit. In conclusion, the present molecular dissection of cubilin has identified the regions important for membrane association and binding of IF-B12 and RAP. The high number of cubilin CUB domains suggests a high number of CUB domain interactions. To address this question we are currently investigating the existence of other cubilin ligands binding to the CUB domain region. We thank Kirsten Lassen for excellent technical assistance."

This serine/threonine kinase requires activation by autophosphorylation which takes place in the presence of activators such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 1The abbreviations dsRNAdouble-stranded RNADRBPdouble-stranded RNA-binding proteineIFeukaryotic initiation factorDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction 1The abbreviations dsRNAdouble-stranded RNADRBPdouble-stranded RNA-binding proteineIFeukaryotic initiation factorDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionor heparin. The most well characterized substrate of PKR is the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2 (3Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PKR by cellular insults, such as viral infection, causes eIF-2 phosphorylation and concomitant inhibition of protein synthesis. In addition to regulating protein synthesis, PKR affects many other cellular processes including transcriptional signaling (4Williams B.R.G. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 191-202Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar), apoptosis (5Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virology. 1994; 199: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and cell growth and differentiation (7Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N.

Recent evidence has also implicated PKR in cell cycle regulation (9Zamanian-Daryoush M. Der S.D. Williams B.R.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The identities of the corresponding substrates of PKR that mediate these actions of PKR have remained elusive. double-stranded RNA double-stranded RNA-binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction double-stranded RNA double-stranded RNA-binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction PKR is the prototype of one class of dsRNA-binding proteins (DRBP). Several human, mouse, Xenopus, Drosophila, viral, and bacterial DRBPs of this class share similar dsRNA-binding motifs (10St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The two such motifs present in PKR have been extensively characterized by mutational and structural analyses (1Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). All dsRNA-binding proteins, however, do not contain these motifs. For example, 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetases, another class of interferon-induced enzymes, also require dsRNA for their activation (11Sarker S.N. Sen G.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Their dsRNA binding characteristics are quite different from those of PKR and they lack the aforementioned dsRNA-binding motifs (12Ghosh S.K. Kusari J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Samanta H. Kumar R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15293-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PKR protein is a dimer (13Patel R.C. Stanton P. McMillan N.M. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 29: 8283-8387Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although additional motifs may also contribute, its dimerization is primarily mediated by the same motifs that initiate its dsRNA binding (13Patel R.C. Stanton P. McMillan N.M. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 29: 8283-8387Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14Gale M. Blakely C.M. Kwieciszewski B. Tan S.L. Dossett M. Tang N.M. Korth M.J. Polyak S.J. Gretch D.R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5208-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The two functions are, however, independent of each other as shown by genetic and biochemical analyses. We have generated mutants of PKR which have lost the ability of dsRNA binding or dimerization or both (15Patel R.C. Stanton P. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25657-25663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7009-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These mutants have revealed the importance of PKR dimerization in its biochemical and cellular activities. Because the dsRNA-binding motifs mediate direct protein-protein interaction, different members of the PKR family of DRBPs can heterodimerize. This property of PKR has recently been exploited by us for cloning a new PKR-interacting human protein, PACT (17Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). As anticipated, PACT is a dsRNA-binding protein as well. But its interaction with PKR is direct and it causes activation and autophosphorylation of PKR in the absence of dsRNA. With the identification of PACT there was reason to expect that there would be other proteins that would interact with both dsRNA and PKR. We report the cloning and characterization of a human protein that was identified both by its dsRNA binding and by its interaction with PKR. DRBP76 was purified to homogeneity from a HeLa cell extract using its dsRNA-binding property. The same protein was also cloned as a PKR-interactive protein in a yeast two-hybrid screening. DRBP76 is a nuclear protein which can be phosphorylated by PKR in vitroand may contribute to a role for PKR in cell-cycle regulation. HeLa cells were extracted by Dounce homogenization in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF). Following a short spin to remove cell debris, the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h and the resulting ribosomal pellet mixed with hypotonic buffer containing 1m KCl. The resuspended material (30 ml) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h and the supernatant/ribosomal salt wash was dialyzed against two changes of 2 liters of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF at 4 °C. The dialysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (Jp 20 rotor) for 20 min and the supernatant and pellets were both frozen at −80 °C. Ribosomal salt wash (2 ml) was dialyzed against 500 ml of buffer A (20 mmNaPO4 buffer, pH 7.0, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF) overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged for 10 min. The supernatant was applied to an 8-ml phosphocellulose P11 (Whatman International Inc.) column pre-equilibrated with buffer A and the column washed with 30 ml of buffer A. A 0–0.5 m NaCl linear gradient (56 ml) in buffer A was used to elute at 1 ml/fraction/8-min flow rate. Each of the gradient fractions (15 μl) was run on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and Northwestern blot analyses were used to identify the fractions containing dsRNA-binding proteins. The fractions containing the 90-kDa dsRNA-binding protein were pooled and dialyzed against 0.2m NaCl in buffer A. This was applied to a 1 ml of poly(I)-poly(C)-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with the same buffer (15 ml), then with buffer A containing 0.5 mNaCl and further washed with 0.5 m NaCl in HEPES buffer, pH 7.9 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA). Finally the protein was eluted from the column with a 0.5–1.0 m (or 0.5–3.0 m) NaCl gradient (20 ml) in HEPES buffer. The fractions containing dsRNA-binding protein were identified by Northwestern blot analysis and the purity was checked by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and staining with the Silver Staining Plus Kit (Bio-Rad). The fractions were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed, and stored at −80 °C. The fractions eluted from the poly(I)-poly(C) column were pooled and concentrated, the proteins separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) for staining with Coomassie Blue. The 90-kDa band was excised for amino-terminal sequencing. Yeast two-hybrid screening (performed perCLONTECH Laboratories instructions) was used to identify interacting proteins for PKR. Since wild type PKR inhibits yeast cell growth, a mutant PKR M3 (L362Q) with only 10% wild type kinase activity was used to construct the Gal4BD-PKR bait plasmid (18Cai R. Williams B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 1273: 11274-11280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 5′-ATTAAGGATCCAAATGGCTGGTGATCTTTCA-3′ and 5′-ATTAACTGCAGTCTAACATGTGTGTCGTTCATT-3′ were used as forward and reverse primers for PCR amplification of PKR M3 from pYex-PKR M3 and the product was ligated into BamHI and PstI cut pGBT9 to create pGBT9-M3. PGBT9-M3 was used to screen a HeLa S3 Gal4 AD library. PGBT9-M3 and human HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA library plasmids (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) were co-transformed into HF7c yeast cells using the LiAc/PEG method. The cells were plated onto SD/-Leu,-Trp,-His triple dropout plates for screening for the His positive clones. Transformation efficiency calculated from the colonies grown on SD/-Leu,-Trp double dropout plates was 2–3 × 106. Out of 30 His positive clones, 11 clones, including clones 1 and 9 were also positive in the β-galactosidase assay and consequently considered to be candidates for PKR interacting proteins. Sequencing of these clones revealed that clone 1 contained sequence identical to the previously identified incomplete coding region of MPP4 (19Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and similar to regions of NF90 (20Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clone 9 also encodes MPP4 but extends clone 1 by 600 base pairs 5′ extension. To confirm the interaction, pGBT9-M3 and library activation plasmids isolated from clones 1 and 9 were co-transformed into HF7c yeast cells to test for the ability to grow in triple dropout plates. Both clones grew on triple dropout plates, confirming their interaction with PKR. Since clone 9 was missing 822 bases of the MPP4 5′ sequence this was retrieved by reverse transcriptase-PCR using 5′-TTAATCTAGAGGATCCCAGAAGAAGTAAAAATGCGTCC-3′ as forward and 5′-TTGCTGTCTGTCTAGATGCCCAATAGC-3′ as reverse primers and cDNA reverse transcribed from HeLa S3 cell RNA. A 1.5-kilobase pairXbaI-EcoRI fragment from clone 9, representing the middle of the MPP protein, was ligated into pBlueScript digested with EcoRI and SbaI. The 1-kilobase pair reverse transcriptase fragment was then inserted into this plasmid via theXbaI site and screened for correct orientation. This clone which lacks the downstream sequence of MPP4 was designated pBS-MPP4-BE2.4. To generate the full-length clone the downstreamEcoRI-XhoI 0.8-kilobase pair fragment of clone 1 was inserted into pET28C via EcoRI and XhoI in combination with the BamHI and EcoRI fragment from pBS-MPP4-BE2.4. Protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and Northwestern analyses were performed as described (21Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 671-682PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of DRBP76 to dsRNA was also assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 0.1 ng of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled dsRNA probe (22,500 cpm/μl) was incubated with 100 ng of single-stranded DNA, 200 ng of poly(A), 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 15 min. In the competitive assays, nonspecific competitor poly(I) was added at 100 ng. Increasing concentrations of purified cellular or purified recombinant DRBP76 were added and incubated an additional 15 min. DsRNA-protein complexes were resolved by separation on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. The interaction of DRBP76 with dsRNA was analyzed by poly(I)-poly(C)-agarose binding (22Patel R.C. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of in vitro translated 35S-labeled DRBP76, generated using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp.). 4 μl of in vitro translation products were diluted with 25 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3 mNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) and incubated with 25 μl of poly(I)-poly(C)-agarose beads at 30 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed 4 times with 500 μl of binding buffer and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Where indicated the NaCl concentration of binding buffer was changed. The interaction of DRBP76 with PKR was analyzed by binding of in vitro translated, labeled DRBP76 with immobilized PKR. The kinase inactive PKR, K296R, and the dsRNA-binding domain of PKR, DRBD, were expressed in bacteria and purified by Ni-agarose affinity chromatography as described (13Patel R.C. Stanton P. McMillan N.M. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 29: 8283-8387Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). 20 μg of purified protein was allowed to bind to 5 μl of packed volume of Ni-agarose beads in the binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and then the beads were washed extensively to remove all unbound protein. Four μl of in vitro translated DRBP76 was incubated with 5 μl of beads containing PKR or DRBP or no protein for 30 min at 30 °C in the binding buffer and the specificity of the binding was assessed by including 10 μg of purified PKR or DRBD in the binding buffer during the incubation. After binding, the resin was washed four times with 500 μl of wash buffer (60 mmimidazole, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The bound proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE gels and fluorography as described. HeLa cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum were harvested at 70% confluency. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and lysed in an equal volume of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 100 U/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mm PMSF, 20% glycerol). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min the supernatants were assayed for PKR activity. PKR was immunprecipitated from aliquots containing 100 μg of total protein using an anti-PKR monoclonal antibody (Ribogene) in high salt buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mm PMSF, 20% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 30 min. Protein A-Sepharose (10 μl of slurry) was added for an additional hour followed by washing four times with high salt buffer (500 μl) and twice with activity buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 200 units/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5% glycerol). The immune complex containing PKR was incubated with activity buffer containing 500 ng of purified eIF-2, 0.1 mm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 10 min. One μg/ml of poly(I)-poly(C) was added as PKR activator. Purified DRBP76 from HeLa cells was added where indicated. Labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. To generate a Flag epitope-tagged version of DRBP76 for expression in mammalian cells, the coding region of pDRBP76 was amplified by PCR from p76/PET28C using 5′-GGCCGGTACCGAAATGAGACCAATGCGAATTTTTG-3′ and 5′-GGCCGAGATCTGGAAGACCCAAAATCATGAAG-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The 2.1-kilobase pair PCR product was ligated first into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and then the Flag epitope tag was attached to the COOH terminus of p76 by excising the subcloned DRBP76 withKpnI and BglII for insertion in the correct reading frame into a Flag epitope cassette in pBluescript KS+ described previously (23Ghosh A.

For mammalian cell expression the Flag epitope-tagged DRBP76 was then excised with KpnI/NotI digestion and inserted into KpnI/NotI cut pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). HT1080 cells on coverslips in 6-well dishes were transfected at 70–80% confluent. Briefly cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum were transfected using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of plasmid DNA per well was used. After 18 h the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with acetone:methanol (1:1) at room temperature for 2 min, and washed twice with TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20). Coverslips were blocked with TBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 3% non-immune goat serum for 40 min at room temperature. Primary rabbit anti-Flag antisera (600 ng/ml in TBST plus 3% bovine serum albumin; Santa Cruz) was added for 2 h, washed 3 times with TBST and secondary was goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:2000 in TBST plus 3% bovine serum albumin; Life Technologies) for 70 min. Cells were washed 3 times with TBST and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) mounting medium containing DAPI. COS 7 cells were transfected with Flag epitope-tagged DRBP76 in pcDNA3 and/or K296R PKR in pRV/CMV (18Cai R. Williams B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 1273: 11274-11280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 20 mmTris, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl containing 1% Triton X-100. Cellular debris was removed by spinning at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Lysates were incubated with either M2 anti-Flag-agarose (Sigma) or monoclonal anti-PKR and Protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to Immobilon membranes and probed with monoclonal anti-PKR (1:10,000) followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL detection (Amersham). The dsRNA-binding proteins were purified from HeLa cell extract. For monitoring the purification, we used Northwestern analysis with a radiolabeled 85-base pair dsRNA (21Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 671-682PubMed Google Scholar) as the probe. An excess of unlabeled single-stranded RNA and dsDNA were included in the binding buffer to reduce nonspecific binding of the probe to proteins with affinity for nucleic acids. Two abundant DRBP of apparent molecular masses of 90 and 110 kDa were detected in the extract. Both of these proteins were bound to ribosomes and were solubilized by high-salt extraction (Fig. 1 A). The ribosomal salt wash fraction was dialyzed to remove NaCl and the proteins were bound to a phosphocellulose column which was eluted with a NaCl gradient. During this elution, the two DRBPs separated from each other (Fig. 1 B). The two proteins shown in lanes 5 and 6 of Fig. 1 B were pooled and subjected to further purification by chomatography on poly(I)-poly(C)-agarose (Fig. 1 C). Fractions shown in lanes 3 and4 of Fig. 1 C were pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated. The preparation was at least 95% pure containing a single protein of an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa as shown by silver staining (Fig. 2 A). The 90-kDa protein was microsequenced and seven residues from its amino terminus were identified (Fig. 2 B). The protein sequence matched the amino-terminal sequences of two known human proteins, MPP4 (19Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and NF90 (20Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol.

B, amino-terminal sequencing of the purified 90-kDa DRBP yielded these amino acids which were identical to the amino termini of MPP4 and NF90.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) cDNAs encoding the 90-kDa DRBP were also isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library using a mutant PKR with reduced kinase activity (18Cai R. Williams B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 1273: 11274-11280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as the bait. Two partially overlapping clones were used to generate a combined clone with the longest open reading frame. The combined cDNAs contained sequence matching that of the previously published partial sequence of MPP4 (19Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but extended this at the 3′ end to complete the coding sequence. However, compared with the MPP4 cDNA, it was missing 822 nucleotides at the 5′ end. The missing residues were restored using reverse transcriptase-PCR from HeLa cell RNA as described under “Materials and Methods.” The complete cDNA encodes a protein of calculated molecular mass of 76 kDa (Fig.3 A) that we will call dsRNA-binding protein 76 (DRBP76). It contains 702 residues and its amino-terminal sequence matched perfectly with the sequence of the protein purified from HeLa cells. The sequence matched with the sequence of MPP4, except that it extended further by 92 residues at the COOH terminus (underlined in Fig. 3 A). The sequence of DRBP76/MPP4 was also similar, but not identical, to that of NF90 (20Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary structure of DRBP76 revealed several interesting features (Fig. 3 B). It has a bipartite nuclear localization signal (24Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar), two dsRNA-binding domains that are conserved in other dsRNA-binding proteins including PKR (10St. Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and an RG2 domain (25Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 26Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2955-2959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a region rich in arginine and glutamine acid residues, that is present in many RNA-binding proteins. In addition, DRBP76 contains five epitopes that are potential sites of phosphorylation in M phase proteins (19Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and two epitopes that are present in the substrates of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (27Pines J. Hunter T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 389-401PubMed Google Scholar). Several of these structural features were validated by functional analyses of DRBP76 as described below. The mRNA encoded by the cDNA clone of DRBP76 was translated in vitro and yields a protein of an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa (Fig.4 A, lane 1). Thus, the apparent molecular weight of the recombinant protein was the same as that of the protein purified from HeLa cells. The recombinant protein bound to poly(I)-poly(C) with a high avidity. Salt concentrations as high as 0.5 m NaCl failed to disrupt the dsRNA-protein interaction (Fig. 4 A). The dsRNA binding characteristics of the purified protein from HeLa cells were further analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Increasing amounts of DRBP76 shifted increasing amounts of labeled dsRNA (Fig. 4 B). The dsRNA-protein complex was heterogenous probably due to the binding of different numbers of protein molecules to the same dsRNA. As a result, some portion of the complex did not enter the gel (open arrow) whereas the rest formed a broad shifted band (solid arrow). The specificity of the binding was confirmed by including in the binding buffer a hundred fold excess of unlabeled poly(I)-poly(C); in the presence of this competitor, the radiolabeled probe failed to bind to the protein and no labeled dsRNA-protein complex was formed (Fig. 4 B, lane 7). To determine the cellular localization, Flag epitope-tagged DRBP76 was transfected into human HT1080 cells and its expression monitored by immunofluorescence analysis using an anti-Flag antibody. DRBP76 was localized exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 5), consistent with previous studies of MPP4 (19Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The in vitro interaction of DRBP76 and PKR was examined by measuring the binding of radiolabeled DRBP76 synthesized in vitro to PKR immobilized on Ni-agarose. DRBP76 bound specifically to PKR (Fig.6, lane 3) and, as anticipated, to DRBD (22Patel R.C. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amino-terminal region of PKR that contains a dimerization domain (Fig. 6, lane 4). The specificity of the observed binding was established by performing the binding reaction in the presence of excess soluble PKR (Fig. 6,lane 5) or soluble DRBD (Fig. 6, lane 6). The presence of PKR or DRBD in the solution inhibited the binding of DRBP76 to the affinity resins. Because DRBP76 interacts with PKR in vitro and it was cloned by its interaction with PKR in yeast, it was clear that the two proteins can bind to each other when they are in close proximity. To determine whether such an interaction occurs in mammalian cells, DRBP76-Flag and an inactive mutant of PKR were co-expressed in COS 7 cells and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. The results show that PKR can be co-immunoprecipitated when both are expressed (Fig. 7). However, it appears that only a small fraction of PKR was bound to DRBP76. This could be explained by DRBP76 being a highly abundant cellular protein and consequently the transfected tagged DRBP76 could be competing with the endogenous protein for binding to PKR. Alternatively since only about 20% of PKR is found in the nucleus, most is not available for binding to DRBP, which is a nuclear protein. Thus, it is likely that only a small fraction of the total cellular pools of the two proteins have the opportunity to interact with each other. To test whether DRBP76 is a substrate for PKR we used an in vitro phosphorylation assay. Under the conditions of this assay, PKR phosphorylated itself and eIF-2 efficiently (Fig. 8, lane 1). When purified DRBP76 was added to the assay mixture, it was phosphorylated as well. The observed phosphorylation of DRBP76 was specific because PKR does not phosphorylate several other proteins. such as PACT, TRBP, or DRBP, which also bind to PKR strongly. We have previously reported that the same structural motifs of PKR mediate both protein-protein interactions and dsRNA binding (13Patel R.C. Stanton P. McMillan N.M. Williams B.R. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 29: 8283-8387Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Given the independent isolation of DRBP76 as a dsRNA-binding protein and a PKR-interacting protein, it is highly likely that the similar motifs present in DRBP76 also carry out these two independent functions. However, it is possible that the PKR-DRBP76 interaction in yeast was enhanced by dsRNA binding because the two proteins can bind the same dsRNA molecule. Recently a similar protein was isolated using adenovirus VA RNAII as a probe and the apparent molecular weight and the N-terminal sequence of this protein indicates that it may be identical to DRBP76 (28Liao H.-J. Kobayashi R. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8514-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The Xenopus homolog of DRBP76, MBP4F, was also cloned as a consequence of its dsRNA binding ability and contains the same structural features as DRBP76 (29Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Cur. Biol. 1994; 4: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Despite the presense of the RG domain which has been shown in other proteins to mediate binding to both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA and DNA (26Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2955-2959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MBP4F binds preferentially to dsRNA and RNA-DNA hybrids (29Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Cur. Biol. 1994; 4: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine the role of the RG domain in DRBP76 nucleotide binding. DRBP76 was cloned by yeast two-hybrid sceening as a PKR-interactive protein, a strategy used previously to identify PACT (17Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Although both PACT and DRBP76 belong to the same family of DRBPs, their properties are quite distinct. PACT is a cytoplasmic protein which activates PKR whereas DRBP76 is a nuclear protein and is a substrate of PKR. PKR exhibits restricted substrate specificity and does not phosphorylate several PKR-binding proteins including TRBP (30Lee K. Fajardo M.A. Braun R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3023-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), PACT (17Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and the dsRNA-binding domain of PKR (21Patel R.C. Sen G.C. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 671-682PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphorylation of DRBP76 by PKR may be of physiological significance, although this would need to be confirmed in vivo. The nuclear location of DRBP76 suggests it is a substrate for the nuclear pool of PKR, for which thus far no substrates have been identified. DRBP76 appears to be the full-length version of the M phase-specific phosphoprotein, MPP4 (19Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). MPP4 was originally cloned as a protein from M phase HeLa cells that was recognized by a monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated epitopes believed unique to M phase proteins. Only a partial cDNA was isolated for MPP4. An antisera generated against MPP4 identified two proteins of apparent size of 90 and 110 kDa from HeLa cells. These are the same sizes as the dsRNA-binding proteins we identified from HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the 110-kDa dsRNA-binding protein is related to DRBP76. MPP4 was shown to be a nuclear protein that becomes hyperphosphorylated during M phase (19Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Another related protein described in the literature is NF-90 (20Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although its sequence diverges from that of DRBP76 both in the center of the protein and again at the COOH terminus. Although NF-90 has been claimed to be a transcription factor of the NFAT family, its primary sequence does not have any homology with those of the other known members of the NFAT family (31Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar) nor is there evidence that it signals analogously to NFATs. It does not contain any of the known DNA-binding motifs but, as for MPP4 and DRBP76, it contains the dsRNA-binding motifs. Recently the DNA-dependent protein kinase was shown to interact with several proteins, one on which had an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa and the amino-terminal sequence shared by DRBP76 and NF90 (32Ting N.S.Y. Kao P.N. Chan D.W. Lintott L.G. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2136-2145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). While this protein cross-reacted with antisera against NF90 and could be shown to be a substrate for DNA-protein kinase no direct binding to DNA was detected. DRBP76 has many interesting structural motifs. It has phosphorylation sites that are hallmarks of M phase proteins (19Matsumoto-Taniura N. Pirollet F. Monroe R. Gerace L. Westendorf J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1455-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These proteins get hyperphosphorylated during M phase by M phase-specific kinases. It also contains sites for phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (27Pines J. Hunter T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 389-401PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of these potential phosphorylation sites suggests that this protein may play a critical role in cell cycle progression. While it is not apparent how dsRNA binding and phosphorylation by PKR may affect this putative function, recent evidence indicates that the activity of PKR is regulated during cell cycle and suggests that PKR may also be involved in cell cycle regulation (9Zamanian-Daryoush M. Der S.D. Williams B.R.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The other notable features of the protein are its RNA-binding domains. There are two distinct dsRNA-binding domains that also mediate PKR-interaction. In addition, near the COOH terminus there are repeated arginine-glycine motifs which are known to mediate protein-RNA interactions (25Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 26Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2955-2959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These features suggest that DRBP76 may participate in specific steps of nuclear RNA metabolism. Defining these events and the role of PKR in their regulation should shed light on the nuclear functions of both DRBP76 and PKR.

Northern blot analysis revealed that the A2AR mRNA level was substantially increased after a 3-h exposure to hypoxia (5% O2), which reached a peak at 12 h. Immunoblot analysis showed that the A2AR protein level was also increased during hypoxia. Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis blocked A2AR induction by hypoxia. In addition, removal of extracellular free Ca2+, chelation of intracellular free Ca2+, and pretreatment with protein kinase C inhibitors prevented A2AR induction by hypoxia. Moreover, depletion of protein kinase C activity by prolonged treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate significantly inhibited the hypoxic induction of A2AR. A2AR antagonists led to a significant enhancement of A2AR mRNA levels during hypoxia, whereas A2AR agonists caused down-regulation of A2AR expression during hypoxia. This suggests that A2AR regulates its own expression during hypoxia by feedback mechanisms. We further found that activation of A2AR enhances cell viability during hypoxia and also inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor expression in PC12 cells. Thus, increased expression of A2AR during hypoxia might protect cells against hypoxia and may act to inhibit hypoxia-induced angiogenic activity mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor.

Lett. 1982; 29: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Once released, Ado acts locally to decrease pre- and postsynaptic excitability, which protects neurons against the metabolic stress associated with oxygen deprivation (3Higgins M. Hosseinzadah H.

Ado mediates its effects on neuronal activity via specific membrane receptors, A1, A2, and A3, that are coupled to adenylate cyclase (AC) via G proteins (5Fredholm B.B. Phamacol.

The A1 and A3 receptors are coupled to Gi protein and cause inhibition of AC, whereas the A2 receptor, which consists of the A2A and A2B receptor subtypes, is coupled to Gs protein and causes an increase in AC activity (6Olah M.E.

Capogna M. Gahwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 917-927Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 8Lupica C. Proctor W. Dunwiddie T.V. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3753-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is based largely on the finding that the A1 receptor inhibits excitatory synaptic neurotransmission in the brain during hypoxia (7Scanziani M. Capogna M. Gahwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 917-927Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 8Lupica C. Proctor W. Dunwiddie T.V. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3753-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the A2 receptor in modulating neuronal activity is less clear. However, the observation that A2 receptors are concentrated in brain regions that are rich in dopamine-containing cells (9Fink J.S. Weaver D.R. Rivkees S.A. Peterfreund R.A. Pollack A.E. Adler E.M. Reppert S.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 14: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 10Johansson B. Fredholm B.B. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) suggests that the A2 receptors are involved in regulating the activity of these cells during hypoxic stress. To test this possibility, we studied the effect of A2 receptor stimulation on membrane excitability in the dopaminergic pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line (11Green S.H. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 222-237Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PC12 cells express the Ado A2A and A2B receptors but not the A1 and A3 receptors (12Williams M. Abreu M. Jarvis M.F. Norohna-Blob L. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Kobayashi S. Conforti L. Pun Y.K. Millhorn D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 95-107Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We found that activation of the A2A receptor in PC12 cells attenuated membrane excitability by activation of an outward K+ current and inhibition of an inward voltage-dependent Ca2+current (13Kobayashi S. Conforti L. Pun Y.K. Millhorn D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 95-107Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the A2 receptor attenuates membrane excitability during hypoxia. Because of the potential importance of the A2AR in mediating the cellular protection during hypoxia, we wondered if A2AR gene expression is regulated by hypoxia. The current study was undertaken to examine this possibility and to characterize further the role of the A2 receptor in regulating the cellular response to hypoxia. Briefly, we found that A2AR expression is increased during hypoxia by a mechanism that involves increased intracellular free Ca2+, protein kinase C (PKC) and de novo protein synthesis. We also found that A2AR regulates its own expression during hypoxia via a feedback-like mechanism. An important finding was that activation of A2AR increased cell viability during exposure to 1% O2 and that activation of A2AR inhibited expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). PC12 cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) that contains 15 mm HEPES buffer, 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml, 100 μg/ml) in an incubator in which the environment (21% O2and 5% CO2, remainder N2, 37 °C) was strictly maintained. Medium was changed twice a week. When cells reached 70% confluence, they were either exposed to continued normoxia or placed in a hypoxic incubator (Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH) that maintained a constant environment (10% O2 or 5% O2, 5% CO2, balanced with N2) for the specified exposure periods. PKA-deficient PC12 cells (A123.7) (14Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose with 15 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and gentamycin (100 μg/ml) and an environment of 21% O2and 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Total cellular RNA was extracted from PC12 cells using TRI-REAGENT (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to instructions. The RNA pellets were resuspended in formamide, and the RNA concentration and purity were determined by measurement of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm with a spectrophotometer. An aliquot (20 μg) of total RNA was taken, and the volumes were equilibrated with formamide. An equal volume of denaturation mixture (2× MOPS, 0.8 m formaldehyde) was added to each sample. The samples were then heated to 65 °C for 15 min to ensure complete denaturation and then electrophoresed in a 1% formaldehyde gel (1 × MOPS buffer, 0.4 mformaldehyde, 1% agarose) at 100 V constant voltage using 1× MOPS (0.02 m MOPS, 8 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EGTA) as the running buffer. Following electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond™-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer using 20× SCC (3 mm sodium chloride, 0.3 m sodium citrate) as the transfer buffer. The membranes were then UV cross-linked (Fisher) and stained with methylene blue for the purpose of total RNA quantification. The membrane was prehybridized for 2–4 h in a buffer (0.05 m sodium phosphate, 10× SCC, 10× Denhardt's reagent, 0.1 μg/ml denaturated salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide) and then hybridized overnight in a buffer (same as prehybridization buffer but with 10% dextran sulfate) and 1.0 × 106 cpm/ml radiolabeled probe. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed three times at 55 °C in 2× SCC, 0.1% SDS and then exposed on a storage phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) for 4–5 h. The screen was scanned, and the signals were quantified (Storm™, Molecular Dynamics). A full-length cDNA encoding the Ado A2A receptor was provided by Dr. J. S. Fink (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). After bacterial amplification of the plasmid, the EcoRI andXbaI fragment of purified A2A receptor was isolated by electrophoresis on a low melting point agarose gel. The 3′-terminal region, which included both coding and noncoding sequence (1192 base pairs), was used as a probe for A2AR Northern blot analysis. The cDNA probe for VEGF was prepared by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and subsequent ligation of the products into a plasmid vector, pCR™2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Primers were constructed based on the reported rat VEGF cDNA sequence (15Conn G. Batne M.L. Soderman D.D. Kwok P.W. Sullivan K.A. Palisi T.M. Hope D.A. Thomas K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2628-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The sequences of primers was 5′-CCA TGA ACT TTC TGC TCT CTT-3′ and 5′-GGT GAG AGG TCT AGT TCC CGA-3′ (predicted length of the amplified DNA fragment is 630 base pairs). The polymerase chain reaction product was sequenced and confirmed to be 100% homology with the reported cDNA sequences. After bacterial amplification of the cloned VEGF cDNA in plasmid pCR™2.1, a VEGF cDNA fragment was excised using ECORI and isolated by electrophoresis on low melting point agarose gel. The probes were labeled using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Prime-A-Gene™, Promega, Madison, WI) and 2-[α-32P]desoxycytidine 5′-trisphosphate (NEN Life Science Products) and then purified on a Sephadex G-50 column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The effect of hypoxia on A2AR protein level was determined by Western immunoblot analysis. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping the cells into 400 μl of a solution containing 0.25m sucrose, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 25 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. Cells were concentrated by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 × gat 4 °C and sonicated at 4 °C for 2 s with a microultrasonic cell disrupter (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) in 200 μl of solution containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, freshly added leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), and dithiothreitol (1 mm). The sample was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mmEDTA, freshly added leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), and dithiothreitol (1 mm) as crude membrane fraction. Membrane preparations were boiled for 3 min in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue as a marker. Samples containing 40 μg of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using standard electrophoresis and electroblotting procedures. Prestained molecular weight markers were obtained from Sigma. To reduce nonspecific binding, blots were preincubated for 1 h in a blocking mixture (3% nonfat dry milk, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were then incubated with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed against the fourth C-terminal intracellular domain (30 amino acids) of Ado A2A receptor (5 μg/ml; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed three times in a buffer containing 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature and incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times over 1 h in the same buffer. Immunolabeling was detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified using densitometric analysis with an ImagePro digital analysis system (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Ado A2AR immunoreactivity was linear over a 10-fold range of protein concentrations. Cell viability was measured as the ability of cells to exclude trypan blue (16Beitner-Johnson D. Leibold J. Millhorn D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 241: 61-66Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were initially grown in 35-mm dishes and then exposed to normoxia or 1% O2 in the presence or absence of an A2R agonist NECA or an Ado receptor antagonist 8-PT for various times. Cells were then detached by trypsinization, and resuspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were further dispersed by passing through a 27-gauge needle. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 1 × PBS, and equal volumes of cell suspension and 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma) were mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then counted using a hemocytometer. Cell viability was determined as the ratio of total viable cells (unstained)/total cell (unstained and stained) × 100%. The results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. (n represents the number of observations). The analysis of variance was used for evaluating the significance of the obtained data. Statistical significance was accepted at the conventional p < 0.05 level by two-tail evaluation. Ado, NECA, 8-PT, diltiazem, cyclohexamide, and actinomycin D were obtained from Sigma. BAPTA/AM, chelerythrine chloride, and calmidazolium chloride were purchased from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Northern blot analyses were performed to determine the effect of hypoxia on A2AR gene expression in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were exposed to a reduced O2 level (10 or 5% O2 in 5% CO2) for 3, 6, 12, or 18 h. Theupper panel of Fig.1 A shows the temporal profile of Ado A2AR mRNA expression during hypoxia. It can be seen that exposure to 10 and 5% O2 led to a time-dependent increase in A2AR mRNA, which reached a peak at 12 h. The averaged results from six separate experiments for each level of hypoxia are shown in the lower panel. The increase in A2AR mRNA in cells exposed to 5% O2 was greater at all time points than that measured in cells exposed to 10% O2. These results show clearly that A2AR gene expression is stimulated in a time- and dose-dependent manner by hypoxia in PC12 cells. We next performed immunoblot analyses to investigate the effect of hypoxia on the level of A2AR protein in PC12 cells. Fig. 1 Bshows the profile of A2AR during increasing duration of hypoxia (5% O2) in PC12 cells. It can be seen that the amount of A2AR protein gradually increased with hypoxia and peaked at 12 h, which is a similar time profile to that found for A2AR mRNA. The averaged results from four separate experiments are provided in thelower panel. A significant increase in A2A receptor protein was measured at 3, 6, 12, and 18 h. Thus, hypoxia up-regulates both the A2AR mRNA and protein levels. Our laboratory has previously shown that an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ is involved in the induction of tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression during hypoxia in PC12 cells (17Raymond R. Millhorn D.E. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We wondered therefore if increased intracellular Ca2+ is involved in regulation of A2AR gene expression during hypoxia. To test this possibility, PC12 cells were exposed to hypoxia in the presence and absence of Ca2+ in the extracellular media. In control experiments (normal extracellular Ca2+ levels), exposure to 5% O2 for 6 and 12 h led to a 2–4-fold increase in A2AR mRNA (Fig.2). This increase in A2AR mRNA was markedly attenuated when the cells were tested in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+-free medium plus 1 mm EGTA) or chelation of intracellular free Ca2+ with BAPTA/AM (100 μm) (Fig. 2,A and B). Thus, an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ is required for induction of A2AR gene expression by hypoxia. In addition, we also found that the induction of A2AR mRNA during hypoxia was significantly reduced in the presence of diltiazem (3 μm), an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker. These findings suggest that the Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space via L-type Ca2+ channels is involved in regulation of A2AR gene expression during hypoxia. Experiments were next performed to identify the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the Ca2+-dependent induction of A2AR gene expression during hypoxia. The two major Ca2+-mediated signal transduction pathways that are activated by increased cytosolic free Ca2+ are the calmodulin (CaM) and PKC systems (18Nishizuka Y. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1989; 262: 1826-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar,19Farago A. Nishizuka Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies were performed to evaluate the possible contribution of these two Ca2+-activated pathways on hypoxic induction of A2AR gene expression. We found that blockade of PKC activity using chelerythrine chloride (CHL) (20 μm) reduced significantly the induction of A2AR gene during hypoxia (Fig.3 A). CHL is a potent and selective inhibitor of the catalytic domain of Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms (20Herbert J.M. Angreeau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). This finding was supported by an additional result that showed that RO-31–8220, another potent selective inhibitor of PKC (21Davis P.D. Elliott L.H. Harris W. Hill C.H. Hurst S.A. Keech E. Kumar M.K. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Wilkinson S.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), completely blocked the hypoxic induction of A2AR gene expression (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, inhibition of CaM with calmidazolium chloride (CMZ, 20 μm) had no effect on the induction of A2AR gene expression during hypoxia (Fig. 3 B). CMZ has been widely used to determine the role of CaM in mediating specific biological responses (22Silver P.J. Pinto P.B. Dachiw J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 2545-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Nakazawa K. Higo K. Tanaka Y. Saito H. Matsuki N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The dose of CMZ used in our experiment was sufficient to block the effect of CaM (22Silver P.J. Pinto P.B. Dachiw J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 2545-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We also found that a higher dose of CMZ (40 μm) had no effect on the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of A2AR mRNA (data not shown). These data indicate that the CaM/Ca2+ pathways are not involved in regulating the hypoxia-induced regulation of A2AR gene expression. The role of PKC in hypoxia-induced enhancement of A2AR mRNA was further examined by incubating cells with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of PKC. Fig. 3 Cshows the effect of PMA on A2AR mRNA. The A2AR mRNA level initially increased and peaked at 3 h but then declined to a level below the original base-line level at 12 h. It is well known that prolonged incubation of cells with PMA leads to down-regulation of PKC (24Huang F.L. Yoshida Y. Cunha-Melo J.R. Beaven M.A. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4238-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of long term (6 and 12 h) incubation of PC12 cells in PMA on hypoxic activation of A2AR gene expression. Our findings show that depletion of PKC activity by prolonged PMA treatment abolished the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of A2AR message (Fig. 3 D). These findings further support the involvement of PKC in hypoxia-induced regulation of A2AR gene expression. We therefore conclude that the induction of A2AR gene expression during hypoxia requires increased intracellular free Ca2+ and activation of PKC. Because the PKA is activated by depolarization and because hypoxia causes depolarization in PC12 cells (25Zhu W.H. Conforti L. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Millhorn D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C657-C665Crossref Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that PKA is involved in the regulation of A2AR gene expression during hypoxia. Our strategy was to use a clonal cell line (A123.7) that was derived from PC12 cells and deficient in PKA enzyme activities (14Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of A2AR gene during 12-h exposure to 5% O2 was slightly greater in A123.7 cells than in the wild type PC12 cells (Fig.4 A). These results indicate that PKA is not responsible for the up-regulation of A2AR during hypoxia and that PKA might actually have an inhibitory effect on induction of A2AR gene expression during hypoxia. We also examined the possibility that activation of PKA by 8-bromo-cAMP induces down-regulation of A2AR mRNA under normoxic conditions. This was accomplished by incubation of cells with 2 mm of 8-bromo-cAMP under normoxic conditions (21% O2) for 3 and 6 h. Our results show that activation of PKA caused down-regulation of A2AR (Fig. 4 B). We conclude therefore that PKA inhibits the expression of A2AR gene under normoxic conditions and that PKA is not involved in mediating increased A2AR gene expression during hypoxia. PC12 cells produce and secrete Ado (26Erny R.E. Berezo M.W. Perlman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1335-1339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Roskosky Jr., R. Roskosky L.M. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that the A2 receptor is coupled to Gs protein and the activation causes stimulation of adenylate cyclase (5Fredholm B.B. Phamacol. Toxicol. 1995; 76: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the possibility that activation of the A2A receptor during hypoxia might modulate the expression of A2AR mRNA in a feedback-like manner. We found that adenosine receptor antagonist 8-PT (10 μm) enhanced the induction of the A2AR gene expression above the level of expression measured in nontreated control PC12 cells (Fig.5 A). In addition, we found that A2AR gene expression was significantly reduced during normoxia (Fig. 5 B) and hypoxia (Fig. 5 C) in PC12 cells that had been incubated with Ado A2 receptor-selective agonist NECA (10 μm). The enhancement of A2AR mRNA during hypoxia (12 h) in the presence of NECA was 284.0 ± 24.4%, whereas the enhancement was only 186.0 ± 17.3% in the untreated cells. The interaction of A2AR activation and hypoxia is likely to be synergistic. These findings indicate that stimulation of the A2AR has a negative effect on hypoxia-induced A2AR gene expression. In contrast, A2AR antagonists facilitate A2AR gene expression during hypoxia. These results provide strong evidence that A2AR modulates its own expression via a feedback-like mechanism. Experiments were performed to determine if de novo protein synthesis is required for the induction of A2AR gene expression during hypoxia. PC12 cells were pretreated with cyclohexamide (CHX; 5 μm), an inhibitor of translation, for 30 min prior to exposure to hypoxia (5% O2; 6 or 12 h). We found that the hypoxic induction of A2AR gene expression was totally abolished in the presence of CHX (Fig.6 A). Thus, the regulation of A2AR gene expression during hypoxia requires de novo protein synthesis, which may include known and unknown transcription factors. Alterations in the levels of an mRNA may result from changes in gene transcription or mRNA stability or a combination of both. We examined the effect of hypoxia on the stability of A2AR mRNA. Transcription was blocked pharmacologically by pretreatment of PC12 cells with actinomycin D (3 μg/ml), a nonspecific blocker of RNA polymerase (28Tamm I. Sehgal P.B. Adv. Virus Res. 1978; 22: 187-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and the time course for the decay of A2AR mRNAs was measured. In this experiment, 30 μg of total RNA was used for analysis. The results showed that there was no difference in the degradation time course in A2A receptor mRNA in cells exposed to either normoxia or hypoxia (Fig. 6 B). Thus, hypoxic regulation of A2AR gene expression does not appear to involve an increase in A2AR mRNA stability. We next examined the role of A2R stimulation in regulating the expression of VEGF, another hypoxia-inducible gene, which is induced by hypoxia in PC12 cells (29Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). We found that the A2R agonist, NECA (10 μm), caused an initial increase in VEGF gene expression during normoxia, which was followed by a progressive inhibition of VEGF mRNA levels (Fig.7 A). We also examined the hypoxia-induced regulation of VEGF gene expression in the presence of an Ado receptor antagonist (8-PT) during hypoxia. VEGF gene expression was examined in cells exposed to hypoxia (5% O2) in the presence or absence of the Ado receptor antagonist, 8-PT (10 μm). Our results revealed that the level of VEGF mRNA was significantly higher in the presence of 8-PT during hypoxia lasting 6 h or longer (Fig. 7 B). These results indicate that activation of A2R by Ado inhibits the expression of VEGF gene expression during prolonged exposure to hypoxia in PC12 cells. We examined the effect of A2AR stimulation on cell viability during severe hypoxic exposure (1% O2), which was measured in the presence of NECA (10 μm) or 8-PT (10 μm) at various time points. We found that 12-h exposure to 1% O2 caused a 30% reduction in cell viability (Fig.8). Cell viability was significantly enhanced in the presence of NECA, while it was significantly reduced in the presence of 8-PT. These results suggest that activation of A2R plays a significant role in maintaining the cellular viability during severe hypoxia and that endogenously produced Ado during hypoxia may be involved in this regulation. Adenosine is a potent modulator of cellular activity during hypoxia (30Bruns R.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We showed previously that activation of the A2AR inhibits membrane excitability during hypoxia by enhancing an outward K+ current and inhibiting an inward Ca2+current (13Kobayashi S. Conforti L. Pun Y.K. Millhorn D.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 95-107Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These are among the first results to s"
https://openalex.org/W1971343912,"We recently demonstrated that the selective cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR 144528 acts as an inverse agonist that blocks constitutive mitogen-activated protein kinase activity coupled to the spontaneous autoactivated peripheral cannabinoid receptor (CB2) in the Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably transfected with human CB2. In the present report, we studied the effect of SR 144528 on CB2 phosphorylation. The CB2 phosphorylation status was monitored by immunodetection using an antibody specific to the COOH-terminal CB2 which can discriminate between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated CB2 isoforms at serine 352. We first showed that CB2 is constitutively active, phosphorylated, and internalized at the basal level. By blocking autoactivated receptors, inverse agonist SR 144528 treatment completely inhibited this phosphorylation state, leading to an up-regulated CB2receptor level at the cell surface, and enhanced cannabinoid agonist sensitivity for mitogen-activated protein kinase activation of Chinese hamster ovary-CB2 cells. After acute agonist treatment, serine 352 was extensively phosphorylated and maintained in this phosphorylated state for more than 8 h after agonist treatment. The cellular responses to CP-55,940 were concomitantly abolished. Surprisingly, CP-55,940-induced CB2 phosphorylation was reversed by SR 144528, paradoxically leading to a non-phosphorylated CB2 which could then be fully activated by CP-55,940. The process of CP-55,940-induced receptor phosphorylation followed by SR 144528-induced receptor dephosphorylation kept recurring many times on the same cells, indicating that the agonist switches the system off but the inverse agonist switches the system back on. Finally, we showed that autophosphorylation and CP-55,940-induced serine 352 CB2 phosphorylation involve an acidotropic GRK kinase, which does not use Giβγ. In contrast, SR 144528-induced CB2 dephosphorylation was found to involve an okadaic acid and calyculin A-sensitive type 2A phosphatase.

CB1 is the prime target, accounting for the psychoactive effects of cannabis, while cannabinoid-induced immunomodulation is mainly CB2-mediated.

We also showed that the CB1 antagonist SR141716 and the CB2 antagonist SR 144528 not only block the actions of cannabinoid agonists but they also suppress the constitutive activity of these receptors, indicating that these molecules act as inverse agonists. Furthermore, we revealed for the first time a novel property of these inverse agonists. We demonstrated that they also switch off the activation induced by other unrelated Gi-dependent receptors such as insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors, strongly suggesting that the biological functions of inverse agonists have been underestimated.In the present study, we investigated the effect of inverse agonists on the desensitization process. It is clearly established that GPCR functionality and expression are dynamically regulated after agonist exposure. Cell exposure to agonists causes the desensitization and sequestration of the receptors. Phosphorylation by serine/threonine kinases and their subsequent binding to members of a family of cytosolic proteins were shown to be key factors for uncoupling the receptor and its cognate G protein and receptor sequestration (22Lefkowitz R.J.

Here we used the constitutively active CB2 stably expressed in the CHO cell line as a cellular model to study the effects of inverse agonists on phosphorylation, cell surface receptor modulation, and CB2 biological responses. The CB2phosphorylation status was monitored by immunodetection using a phosphorylation state-specific antibody. We showed that the inverse agonist SR 144528 inhibits phosphorylation of the constitutively autoactivated CB2. In addition, we found that SR 144528 induced extensive CB2 dephosphorylation of agonist-induced CB2 phosphorylation. These data provide new insight into the relationship between inverse agonists and the phosphorylation/desensitization process.

CB1 is the prime target, accounting for the psychoactive effects of cannabis, while cannabinoid-induced immunomodulation is mainly CB2-mediated.

A mutant Akt (Akt-AA) in which the phosphorylation sites targeted by growth factors are replaced by alanine was shown to inhibit insulin-induced activation of both Akt and glycogen synthase in L6 myotubes. Expression of a mutant Akt in which Lys179 in the kinase domain was replaced by aspartate also inhibited insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase but had no effect on insulin activation of endogenous Akt. A kinase-defective mutant of PKCλ (λΔNKD), which prevents insulin-induced activation of PKCλ, did not affect the activation of glycogen synthase by insulin. Insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was inhibited by Akt-AA in Chinese hamster ovary cells. However, λΔNKD had no effect on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation induced by insulin. These data suggest that Akt, but not PKCλ, is required for insulin activation of glycogen synthase and for insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1.

Insulin exerts a variety of effects on carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism (1Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although the intracellular signaling cascades that mediate these divergent actions remain to be fully characterized, phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase, composed of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit and a Src homology 2 domain-containing regulatory subunit, is thought to play a central role in several metabolic effects of insulin (1Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2Holman G.D. Kasuga M.

Inhibition of PI 3-kinase with the use of pharmacological or molecular biological strategies has revealed a variety of molecules that act downstream of this enzyme (3Shepherd P.R Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). One such molecule that appears to function immediately downstream of PI 3-kinase is the serine-threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B). Akt interacts through its pleckstrin homology domain with the phospholipids produced by PI 3-kinase and is thereby activated in vitro (4Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 5Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 of Akt is also important for its activation (6Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P.

Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell.

Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). PDK1 is also thought to regulate members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of enzymes (9Le Good J.A. Zigler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J.

However, despite the identification of these various molecules that act downstream of PI 3-kinase, relatively little is known of how signals diverge at this key step of insulin signaling and of which molecules are responsible for each of the specific biological activities of this hormone. Synthesis and breakdown of glycogen are important aspects of carbohydrate homeostasis. Glycogen synthase, a key enzyme that catalyzes glycogen synthesis, is activated by insulin in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner (21Yamamoto-Honda R. Tobe K. Kaburagi Y. Ueki K. Asai S. Yachi M.

However, demonstration of such a role for Akt would require investigation of the effects of specific inhibition of Akt on insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase. Furthermore, it is important to study the regulation of glycogen synthase in physiologically relevant cells, such as muscle cells or hepatocytes, because such regulation may differ among cell or tissue types (24Ueki K.

Although insulin affects multiple steps of protein synthesis, initiation of mRNA translation is thought to be one of its most important targets (27Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The small, heat- and acid-stable protein 4E-BP1 (also known as PHAS-1) is rapidly phosphorylated in response to insulin (28Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N.

Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 results in a decrease in its binding affinity for eIF-4E, an essential translation initiation factor for certain mRNAs that possess an m7(5′)Gppp(5′)N (where N is any nucleotide) cap structure (27Sonenberg N.

O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The relevance of this latter observation is unclear, however, because this and similar kinase-defective mutants of Akt do not exert a dominant inhibitory effect on insulin-induced activation of Akt (7Kitamura T.

With the use of this mutant, we have also shown that Akt is essential for stimulation of bulk protein synthesis by insulin (7Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that PKCλ is activated by insulin in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner, and that a PKCλ mutant that prevents insulin-induced activation of endogenous PKCλ markedly, but not completely, inhibits insulin stimulation of glucose transport (14Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that PKCλ acts downstream of PI 3-kinase to mediate certain biological effects of insulin. In the present study, we have investigated the roles of Akt and PKCλ in the insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in L6 myotubes and CHO cells, respectively. In particular, the requirement for these two protein kinases in the effects of insulin have been evaluated by specifically inhibiting their activities with the use of dominant negative mutants. L6 myoblasts were maintained and induced to differentiate into myotubes as described previously (34Mitsumoto Y. Liu Z. Klip A. Endocr. J. 1993; 1: 307-315Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to Akt (αpanAkt) were generated against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 428–480 of rat Akt1, as described (7Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H.

Polyclonal antibodies to PKCλ were generated in response to a peptide corresponding to amino acids 197–213 of mouse PKCλ (1Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell.

Polyclonal antibodies specific to Akt2 (PKBβ) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, and those specific to Akt3 (PKBγ) (36Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

An adenovirus vector encoding FLAG epitope-tagged Akt-AA (AxCAAkt-AAFL) was constructed with the use of an adenovirus expression kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and a cDNA (produced by the polymerase chain reaction) encoding Akt-AA (7Kitamura T.

CHO cells or fully differentiated L6 myotubes were infected with adenovirus vectors at the indicated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) as described previously (7Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H.

The cells were subjected to experiments 24–48 h after infection. L6 myotubes were deprived of serum for 16–20 h, incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nminsulin for 10 min, and then immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. For assay of Akt activity, the frozen cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to either Akt or HA, as described previously (7Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y.

For assay of PKCλ activity, the frozen cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PKCλ. The kinase activity in the resulting immunoprecipitates was then assayed with myelin basic protein as substrate, as described (14Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y.

MAP kinase activity and PI 3-kinase activity were assayed in immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to MAP kinase or to phosphotyrosine, respectively, as described previously (35Sakaue H.

For analysis of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, serum-deprived CHO cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 10 min, scraped into a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm potassium fluoride, 10 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. After removal of debris by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the resulting supernatant was heated at 100 °C for 7 min. The resulting precipitated material was removed by centrifugation, and the new supernatant was subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to 4E-BP1. Alternatively, serum-deprived CHO cells were washed twice with KRH buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 119 mmNaCl, 4.95 mm KCl, 2.54 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mm potassium phosphate, 1.19 mmMgSO4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with KRH buffer containing 3% BSA and [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml). After subsequent incubation in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 10 min, the cells were washed twice with KRH buffer containing 1% BSA and lysed in a solution containing 10% glycerol, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The lysate was centrifuged (15,000 × g for 20 min), and the resulting supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies to 4E-BP1. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with a lysis buffer, then two times with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40, then washed two times with a solution containing 200 mm LiCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol. The precipitates were then boiled in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 15% gel; the incorporation of radioactivity into 4E-BP1 was visualized or quantitated with a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer. Glycogen synthase activity was assayed essentially as described (21Yamamoto-Honda R. Tobe K. Kaburagi Y. Ueki K. Asai S. Yachi M. Shirouzu M. Yodoi J. Akanuma Y. Yokoyama S. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J.

In brief, serum-deprived differentiated L6 myotubes in 60-mm culture dishes were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nminsulin for 30 min at 37 °C, and then lysed in 120 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm potassium fluoride, 10 mm PMSF and 30% (v/v) glycerol. After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation, 30 μl of the supernatant were mixed with 60 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20 mm EDTA, 25 mm potassium fluoride, glycogen (10 mg/ml), and 6.7 mm uridine diphospho-d-[U-14C]glucose (0.05 μCi), in the absence or presence of 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by spotting the reaction mixture onto filter paper, and glycogen was precipitated on the paper by soaking in ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol. Each filter was washed four times with ice-cold 70% ethanol, and the radioactivity remaining on the paper was then measured with a liquid scintillation counter. The activity ratio (the ratio of the activity in the absence of glucose 6-phosphate to that in its presence) was calculated. L6 myotubes were incubated for 10 min in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies that recognize all three known isoforms of Akt (αpanAkt) (7Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The resulting immunoprecipitates were then assayed for kinase activity with histone 2B as substrate. The amount of Akt activity in the precipitate from insulin-treated cells was about 5 times that in the precipitate from untreated cells (Fig.1 A). We have previously shown that a mutant Akt in which the sites of ligand-induced phosphorylation are replaced by alanine (Akt-AA) inhibits the activation of endogenous or transfected Akt by insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, or heat treatment in 3T3-L1 adipocytes or CHO cells (7Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 33Kuroda S. Ogawa W. Kitamura T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether Akt-AA exerts similar effects in L6 myotubes. Myotubes were infected with an adenovirus vector encoding HA-tagged wild-type Akt (AxCAAkt-WT) at an m.o.i. of 0.5 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell and, after 12 h, infected again with an adenovirus encoding FLAG-tagged Akt-AA (AxCAAkt-AAFL) at various MOIs. After an additional 20 h, the myotubes were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 10 min, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to HA. Assay of the resulting immunoprecipitates for Akt activity revealed that insulin increased the activity of HA-Akt to an extent similar to that observed for endogenous Akt (Fig. 1 C). Infection of the cells with AxCAAkt-AAFL inhibited insulin-induced activation of HA-Akt in an m.o.i.-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C), without affecting the amount of HA-Akt protein present in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B). At an AxCAAkt-AAFL m.o.i. of 10 pfu/cell, insulin-induced activation of HA-Akt was almost completely abolished. Infection with AxCAAkt-AAFL did not affect insulin activation of MAP kinase (Fig. 1 D) or of PI 3-kinase (as assayed in precipitates prepared with antibodies to phosphotyrosine) (data not shown), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of Akt-AA on Akt activation is specific. Infection of the myotubes with a control virus encoding β-galactosidase (AxCALacZ) at an m.o.i. of 10 pfu/cell did not affect insulin activation of Akt (data not shown). These results suggest that Akt-AA exerts a dominant negative effect on insulin-induced Akt activation. We next investigated the effect of Akt-AA on endogenous Akt activity in L6 myotubes by precipitating the endogenous protein with αpanAkt. Because these antibodies recognize both endogenous and recombinant Akt proteins, Akt-AA was immunodepleted from cell lysates with antibodies to FLAG before endogenous Akt was immunoprecipitated with the antibodies to Akt and assayed for kinase activity. Infection of L6 myotubes with AxCAAkt-AAFL resulted in a dose-dependent increase in total Akt protein (Fig.2 A); at an m.o.i. of 10 pfu/cell, the abundance of Akt-AA was ∼20 times that of endogenous Akt. After three sequential rounds of immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with antibodies to FLAG, the amounts of Akt protein remaining in the supernatant were similar for infected and noninfected cells (Fig. 2 A), indicating that Akt-AA was completely removed by this procedure. The insulin-induced activation of endogenous Akt was inhibited by AxCAAkt-AAFL in an m.o.i.-dependent manner, and at an m.o.i. of 20 pfu/cell, insulin-induced activation of endogenous Akt was almost completely abolished (Fig.2 B). We have previously shown that Akt-K179D, a mutant Akt in which Lys179 in the kinase domain is replaced by aspartate, did not inhibit insulin-induced activation of Akt when overexpressed in CHO cells (7Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of Akt-K179D on endogenous Akt activity in L6 myotubes. Myotubes were infected with a virus encoding HA-tagged Akt-K179D (AxCAAkt-K179D), incubated in the absence or presence of insulin, and lysed. Akt-K179D was then immunodepleted from the cell lysates with antibodies to HA, after which endogenous Akt in the remaining supernatant was immunoprecipitated with αpanAkt and assayed for kinase activity. Although the amount of Akt protein in the cells infected with AxCAAkt-K179D at an m.o.i. of 10 pfu/cell was similar to that in cells infected with AxCAAkt-AAFL at the same m.o.i. (Fig. 2 C), activation of endogenous Akt by insulin was not affected by Akt-K179D (Fig. 2 D). Although we have previously shown that αpanAkt recognize all three known isoforms of rat Akt transiently expressed in COS cells (7Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), a recent report has suggested that the previously cloned rat Akt3 (PKBγ) may be a minor splice variant of this isoform (37Brodbeck D.

COPII consists of three parts: Sar1p and the two protein complexes, Sec23p-Sec24p and Sec13p-Sec31p. Using a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein with mouse Sec23p, we identified a novel mammalian Sec23p-interacting protein, p125, which is clearly distinct from Sec24p. The N-terminal region of p125 is rich in proline residues, and the central and C-terminal regions exhibit significant homology to phospholipid-modifying proteins, especially phosphatidic acid preferring-phospholipase A1. We transiently expressed p125 and mouse Sec23p in mammalian cells and examined their interaction. The results showed that the N-terminal region of p125 is important for the interaction with Sec23p. We confirmed the interaction between the two proteins by a yeast two-hybrid assay. Overexpression of p125, like that of mammalian Sec23p, caused disorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment and Golgi apparatus, suggesting its role in the early secretory pathway."

Heterodimerization between members of the Bcl-2 family proteins is a key event in the regulation of apoptosis. We report here that Bcl-2 protein was selectively cleaved by active caspase-3-like proteases in CTLL-2 cell apoptosis in response to interleukin-2 deprivation. Structural and functional analyses of the cleaved fragment revealed that the NH2-terminal region of Bcl-2 (1–34 amid acids) was required for its anti-apoptotic activity and heterodimerization with pro-apoptotic Bax protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of the NH2-terminal region showed that substitutions of hydrophobic residues of BH4 domain resulted in the loss of ability to form a heterodimer with Bax. Particularly instructive was that the V15E mutant of Bcl-2, which completely lost the ability to form a heterodimer with Bax, failed to inhibit Bax- and staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 is critical for its heterodimerization with Bax and for exhibiting anti-apoptotic activity.

Apoptosis is essential for development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis and for elimination of harmful cells in multicellular organisms (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family proteins play an important role in the apoptotic pathway through regulation of the activity of caspases, which cleave vital cellular substrates to execute apoptosis (2Nicholson D.W.

The Bcl-2 family possesses both pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak, Bcl-XS, Bad, Bik, Bid, Hrk, and Bim) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1) molecules (3Farrow S.N. Brown R. Curr. Opin.

A striking characteristic of Bcl-2 family members is their propensity to form homodimers with themselves and heterodimers between pro- and anti-apoptotic family members (6Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S.

Deletion of either BH1 or BH2 nullifies the ability of Bcl-2 to heterodimerize with Bax and suppress cell death (8Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). The BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bax is required for its homodimerization, heterodimerization with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and induction of apoptosis (9Chittenden T. Flemington C.

The hydrophobic residues within the BH3 domain of Bax have been found to be critical for dimerization and apoptosis induction (11Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Structural studies of a Bcl-XL monomer revealed that the BH1–4 domains corresponded to helices 1 to 7. Notably, the BH1, 2, and 3 domains are in close proximity and create a hydrophobic pocket that is presumably involved in interactions with BH3-containing peptides of the death promoters (13Muchmore S.W.

However, the mechanism of the anti-apoptotic function of the BH4 domain is yet uncertain.

Bcl-2 homology monoclonal antibody polyclonal antibody benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene benzyloxycarbonyl-Glu-Val-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin staurosporine interleukin 2 wild type green fluorescent protein 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Previous reports, together with our results, showed that Bcl-2 was cleaved by caspase-3-like proteases at D31AGD34↓A, removing the NH2-terminal 1–34 amino acids, which contains the BH4 domain. In the course of analyzing the ΔN mutant of Bcl-2, which mimicked the cleaved Bcl-2 fragment, we found that the NH2-terminal region of Bcl-2 was also required for heterodimerization with Bax and for its anti-apoptotic activity. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis identified that the hydrophobic residues in the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 were critical for dimerization with Bax and inhibition of cell death. Murine IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and 20 units/ml recombinant mouse IL-2. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml kanamycin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air. The pFLAG-CMV-2 vectors (Eastman Kodak Co.) containing murine wild-type bcl-X L(WT-bcl-X L) and the NH2-terminal truncation of bcl-X L(ΔN-bcl-X L, lacking the NH2-terminal 1–61 amino acids) were previously described (18Fujita N. Nagahashi A. Nagashima K. Rokudai S. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Murine wild-type bcl-2 (WT-bcl-2), the NH2-terminal truncation of bcl-2(ΔN-bcl-2, lacking the NH2-terminal 1–34 amino acids), and bax cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with CTLL-2 mRNA as the template. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into a pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego) and subcloned in-frame into anEcoRI site of pc5XP vector, a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing an Xpress epitope at the 5′ end, or the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Kodak). The pc5XP vector containing wild-type bcl-2cDNA or the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector containing wild-typebcl-2 cDNA was employed as the template for mutagenesis using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) Substitutions of amino acids (V15E, Y21D, S24E, W30S, D31A, D34A, and D36A) in bcl-2 cDNA were accomplished by converting the corresponding amino acid codon GTG, TAT, TCA, TGG, GAT, GAT, or GAC to GAG, GAT, GAA, TCG, GCT, GCT, or GCC, respectively. The proper construction of all plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild-type mouse Bcl-2 and mutant proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine usingin vitro transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). The translated proteins in reticulocyte lysate (2 μl) were incubated with active caspase-3, -6, or -7 in caspase assay buffer for 12 h at 37 °C (18Fujita N. Nagahashi A. Nagashima K. Rokudai S. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The reactions were applied to a 15–25% gradient polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. Experiments were performed as described previously (18Fujita N. Nagahashi A. Nagashima K. Rokudai S. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells or HT1080 cells were grown to about 80% confluence in 60-mm plates before transfection. Five μg of the pFLAG-CMV-2 vectors containing mock, WT-bcl-2, ΔN-bcl-2, WT-bcl-X L, ΔN-bcl-X L, or bcl-2 mutant cDNAs were transiently transfected into cells using a Superfect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The transfected cells were lysed 24 h later, and the cell lysates were used for Western blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assay. To investigate the effects of Bcl-2 mutants on the inhibition of Bax-induced apoptosis, each Bcl-2 mutant plasmid (1 μg) was co-transfected into 293T cells with 1 μg of pc5XP-Bax and 1 μg of pcDNA3 vector expressing enhanced GFP protein. To investigate the effects of Bcl-2 mutants on the inhibition of STS-induced apoptosis, each Bcl-2 mutant plasmid (1.5 μg) was co-transfected into HT1080 cells with 1 μg of pcDNA3 vector expressing enhanced GFP protein. The proportion of apoptotic cells were determined in GFP-positive cells that showed nuclear condensation and fragmentation confirmed by DAPI staining. 293T cells co-transfected with Bax and Bcl-2 mutants were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 40,000 rpm. Twenty μg of the cell lysate were used to incubate with 20 μmfluorogenic substrate DEVD-AMC (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) in caspase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at 37 °C. The AMC released from the fluorogenic substrates was excited at 380 nm, and the emission was measured at 460 nm using a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer, model F-2000 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were solubilized under reduced conditions with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The electrophoresed proteins were transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with an anti-mouse Bcl-2 mAb (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), an anti-human Bcl-2 pAb (Calbiochem), an anti-human Bax pAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and an anti-FLAG M5 mAb (Kodak). The membranes were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated second antibody followed by developing with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) mixture (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were lysed in isotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 142.5 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% aprotinin). The cell lysates were incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Kodak) for 2 h. After washing with washing buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 142.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% aprotinin), immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis. We previously reported that IL-2 deprivation could induce apoptosis in IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells (18Fujita N. Nagahashi A. Nagashima K. Rokudai S. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). When we examined the expression of Bcl-2, we found an additional band (23 kDa) cross-reactive to the specific anti-mouse Bcl-2 mAb was observed in apoptotic CTLL-2 cells cultured in medium containing 0 or 0.01 ng/ml IL-2 but not in viable CTLL-2 cells cultured in medium containing 0.1 or 1 ng/ml IL-2 (Fig. 1 A). Because caspases were activated during CTLL-2 cell apoptosis, we examined whether this novel 23-kDa band was a cleaved product of Bcl-2. The addition of the cell-permeable caspase inhibitor Z-VAD, Z-EVD, or Z-Asp to CTLL-2 cells cultured in IL-2-depleted medium suppressed the activation of caspase-3-like proteases (data not shown) and blocked the appearance of the 23-kDa band (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the novel 23-kDa protein was indeed a cleaved Bcl-2 fragment. To identify the still unclear cleavage sites in mouse Bcl-2 protein, we constructed several Bcl-2 mutant cDNAs in which the aspartic acid codon at 31, 34, or 36 was converted to the alanine codon (D31A, D34A, or D36A, respectively) because the caspase-3-like proteases specifically cleaved its substrates at DXXD↓ motif (in which X may be any amino acid). The wild-type and mutant Bcl-2 proteins were produced by in vitrotranscription/translation in reticulocyte lysates and were incubated with recombinant active human caspase-3, -6, or -7. As shown in Fig.1 C, the wild-type Bcl-2 was cleaved by caspase-3, -6, and -7, whereas the D31A and D34A mutants, but not the D36A mutant, could block the cleavage by caspase-3. This suggested that Bcl-2 protein was cleaved at the site D31AGD34↓A. Similar to Bcl-2, Bcl-XL was also cleaved by caspase-3 at the site of HLAD61↓S and SSLD76↓A (18Fujita N. Nagahashi A. Nagashima K. Rokudai S. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL lost the NH2-terminal region containing the BH4 domain, which is only conserved in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. To investigate the biological function of the NH2-terminal region of Bcl-2, we tested the effect of the NH2-terminal deleted Bcl-2 mutant (ΔN-Bcl-2) (Fig. 2 A) on Bax-induced apoptosis. The pFLAG-CMV-2 vector encoding either mock, WT-bcl-2, or ΔN-bcl-2 was co-transfected with the pc5XP vector containing bax cDNA and the pcDNA3 vector containing GFP cDNA into 293T cells. After transfection for 8 h, the activity of caspase-3-like proteases and the extent of apoptosis were assessed using the fluorogenic-labeled tetrapeptide DEVD-AMC and DAPI staining, respectively. Wild-type Bcl-2 could counteract Bax-induced caspase activation, whereas ΔN-Bcl-2 could not inhibit Bax-induced caspase activation (Fig. 2 B) and apoptotic cell death (Fig. 2 C), similar to mock transfection, indicating that the NH2-terminal region of Bcl-2 was essential for exhibiting its anti-apoptotic function. ΔN-Bcl-2 might not have the ability to promote apoptosis as effectively as Bax because the overexpression of ΔN-Bcl-2 alone could not induce apoptosis in 293T cells (data not shown). To further investigate the molecular mechanisms by which ΔN-Bcl-2 lost its apoptosis inhibitory function, we examined its ability to bind to Bax in vivo. The binding ability of ΔN-Bcl-XL to Bax was also investigated. Sequential immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed using cell extracts from the transfected 293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type and ΔN-mutant constructs of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to determine whether deletion of the NH2-terminal region disrupted their heterodimerization with endogenous Bax. After transfection for 24 h, the size and stability of the corresponding proteins were confirmed by examining extracts from the transfected cells by Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG M5 mAb (Fig. 3 A,upper panel). The extracts from each transfectant had comparable amounts of Bax protein before immunoprecipitation experiments, as confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-human Bax pAb (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). When these FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG M2 mAb and then subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-Bax pAb, both wild-type Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins bound to Bax. In contrast, the NH2-terminal-deleted mutants of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL failed to interact with Bax (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the NH2-terminal regions of Bcl-2 (amino acids 1–34) and Bcl-XL (amino acids 1–61) are necessary for heterodimerization with Bax. The NH2-terminal regions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL contain the BH4 domain that is only conserved in the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Fig.4 A). To investigate the specific, conserved sequence of the BH4 domain in the NH2-terminal region that is critical for the ability of Bcl-2 to form a heterodimer with Bax, we generated four site-directed point mutants in which the most conserved hydrophobic residues (Val15, Tyr21, and Trp30) or the Raf-1 kinase target residue within α1 amphipathic helix of BH4 domain (Ser24) (13Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar) were converted to charged residues, as shown in Fig. 4 A. These Bcl-2 mutants were transfected into 293T cells, and we analyzed their ability to bind to Bax in vivo. The transfection of the mutant Bcl-2 proteins did not affect the expression level of endogenous Bax in 293T cells (Fig. 4 B,lower panel). Interestingly, the V15E mutant completely abrogated the ability to interact with Bax like ΔN-Bcl-2 did (Fig.4 C, lanes 4 and 3, respectively). Other amino acid replacements, such as Y21D and W30S mutants, also displayed reduced binding ability to Bax (Fig. 4 C,lanes 5 and 7, respectively). In contrast, the S24E mutant displayed the same binding capability with Bax as WT-Bcl-2 did (Fig. 4 C, lanes 6 and 2, respectively). These results suggest that the hydrophobic surface within BH4 domain is critical for Bcl-2 to interact with Bax. Because Bax has been reported to form homodimers on the mitochondria membrane to initiate caspase activation and apoptosis, we further investigated whether the BH4 mutant (V15E), which lost the ability to bind to Bax, could inhibit caspase activation and apoptosis. Because the overexpression of V15E mutant itself could not induce apoptosis in 293T cells (data not shown), we examined its apoptosis-regulatory effect on Bax-induced apoptosis. The pFLAG-CMV-2 vector containing WT-bcl-2, ΔN-bcl-2, or V15E mutant was co-transfected with the pc5XP vector containing wild-type bax cDNA and the pcDNA3 vector containing GFP cDNA into 293T cells. After incubation for 8 h, the apoptotic cells were counted among the GFP-positive cells with nuclear fragmentation confirmed by DAPI staining, as shown in Fig. 5 B. Expression of wild-type Bcl-2 inhibited Bax-induced apoptosis. In contrast, both the V15E mutant and ΔN-Bcl-2 failed to protect cells from undergoing Bax-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, we examined whether V15E mutant lost the apoptosis-inhibitory function in STS-induced apoptosis. After transfection of the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector containing WT-bcl-2, ΔN-bcl-2, or V15E mutant in HT1080 cells, the transfected cells were treated with 1 μm STS for 8 h. As shown in Fig. 5 C, V15E mutant and ΔN-Bcl-2 could not suppress the STS-induced apoptosis in HT1080 cells, whereas wild-type Bcl-2 protected cells from undergoing apoptosis. Thus, the Val15residue exhibited a critical role in modulating the structure and function of BH4 domain of Bcl-2. Interestingly, when examining the amount of Bcl-2 protein in transfected 293T cells, we found that the co-transfection ofbax cDNA reduced the expression level of exogenous ΔN-Bcl-2 and V15E mutant (Fig. 6,lower panel, lanes 2 and 3), as compared with that of WT-Bcl-2 (Fig. 6, lower panel,lane 1). Similarly, the amount of exogenous Bax, but not the endogenous Bax, was also decreased in ΔN-Bcl-2 and V15E mutant transfectants (Fig. 6, middle panel, lanes 2 and3). To elucidate the reason for the decreased expression of both Bax and mutant Bcl-2 proteins in the transfected cells, we performed the above co-transfection experiments in the presence of the caspase inhibitor Z-Asp. Z-Asp could recover the exogenous protein level of both ΔN-Bcl-2, V15E mutant (Fig. 6, lower panel,lanes 5 and 6) and Bax (Fig. 6, middle panel, lanes 5 and 6). However, the cysteine protease inhibitor Z-LLH and calpain inhibitor E-64 had no such effects (data not shown). These data suggested that the reduced expression of exogenous ΔN-Bcl-2, V15E mutant, or Bax was caused by rapid cell death in the ΔN-Bcl-2- and V15E mutant-transfected cells because of the inability of ΔN-Bcl-2 and V15E mutant to suppress Bax-induced apoptosis, as shown in Fig. 5. To rule out that the reduced binding abilities of ΔN-Bcl-2 and V15E mutant with Bax are not due to the decreased expression of these proteins in 293T cells, we tested the abilities of ΔN-Bcl-2 and V15E mutant to form heterodimers with Bax in the presence of Z-Asp. As shown in Fig. 6, wild-type Bcl-2 could bind both exogenous Xpress-tagged Bax and endogenous Bax (upper panel, lanes 1 and 4). In contrast, the ΔN-Bcl-2 and V15E mutant lost their abilities to form heterodimers with Bax even in the presence of Z-Asp (Fig. 6, upper panel,lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, our results provide an instructive example that the V15E mutant could not inhibit apoptosis due to the reduced capacity to dimerize with Bax. The Bcl-2 protein plays an essential role in preventing cell death. Its anti-apoptotic activity is regulated through association with Bcl-2 homologous and nonhomologous proteins and also by phosphorylation at the serine residue (12Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL revealed at least three discrete functional regions. The first region (transmembrane domain) is a hydrophobic domain at the COOH terminus that confers membrane anchorage; deletion of this region reduces but does not eliminate Bcl-2 activity (19Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second region (BH1 and BH2 domains) is critical for both their anti-apoptotic function and the capacity to heterodimerize with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins like Bax or Bak (7Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 8Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N.

Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Almost all BH1 or BH2 mutants that disrupt heterodimerization with Bax lose the death repressor function. The third region is located at the NH2 terminus. The NH2-terminal deletion mutants not only failed to prevent apoptosis (21Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) but also functioned as trans-dominant inhibitors of wild-type Bcl-2 (19Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G.

Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), although its mechanism is unknown. Growing evidence has demonstrated that Bax may dominantly regulate caspase activation (23Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The ability of Bax to localize to mitochondrial membranes (24Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) may relate to its ability to form distinct ion-conductive channels (26Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S.

Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The structural features of Bax and Bcl-2 that allow them to participate in homo- and heterodimerization phenomena are markedly different, despite their amino acid sequence similarity. Deletional analysis studies indicate that BH3 is a critical domain of Bax for both homo- and heterodimerization (9Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 10Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the capacity of Bax-derived BH3 peptides to block homo- and heterodimerization with Bcl-2 family members (28Diaz J.L. Oltersdorf T. Horne W. McConnell M. Wilson G. Weeks S. Garcia T. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11350-11355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). BH3-deleted Bax molecules also showed impaired killing activity (7Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 9Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8521-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Some cell death activators in Bcl-2 family contain only the BH3 domain but not BH1, BH2, or BH4 (30Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutations within the BH3 domain do not significantly affect the anti-apoptotic functions of Bcl-2. Consistent with this, a genetic approach with Bcl-2-deficient and Bax-deficient mice also suggested that Bax could function independently of Bcl-2 (31Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Thus, Bax seems to dominantly induce apoptosis by its own activity rather than by blocking the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-XLinversely inhibit apoptosis through forming heterodimers with Bax or other types of proteins ranging from protein kinases and phosphatases to proteins that bind caspases (15Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 16Shibasaki F. Kondo E. Akagi T. McKeon F.

Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Previous results and the present report showed that the cleavage of Bcl-2 (both in human and mouse Bcl-2) by caspases (Fig. 1) (22Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) removed the NH2-terminal region of Bcl-2 (amino acid 1–34), which contains the BH4 domain that is conserved among the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Our data revealed that the NH2-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN-Bcl-2), which mimics the cleaved Bcl-2 fragment, could not suppress Bax- and STS-induced apoptosis in transfected 293T cells and HT1080 cells, respectively (Figs. 2 and 5). Although the NH2-terminal region is critical for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis, the molecular mechanisms by which loss of NH2-terminal region affect the activity of Bcl-2 has not been fully understood. Our data reported herein showed that deletion of the NH2-terminal region of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XLabrogated their heterodimerization with Bax (Fig. 3 B) in mammalian cells in vivo and thus lost their apoptosis-inhibitory activity, suggesting that the heterodimerization of Bcl-2 with Bax depends on not only the BH1–2 but also BH4 domains. This is consistent with the previous reports showed a requirement for NH2-terminal region of Bcl-2 for binding to Bax (6Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5497-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a yeast two-hybrid system. The structural analysis of the Bcl-XL monomer promoted a molecular model of the BH4 domain within the NH2-terminal region of Bcl-2, which revealed an amphipathic helix (α1 helix) on the surface that forms extensive hydrophobic interactions with α2, α5, and α6 (13Muchmore S.W.

Through mutagenesis analysis of the BH4 domain in Bcl-2, we revealed several critical amino acids responsible for modulating the conformation of BH4 domain and affecting its function. The V15E mutant, which replaced a hydrophobic residue with a charged residue, proved most instructive because it lost the ability to heterodimerize with Bax (Fig. 4) as well as its anti-apoptotic activity (Fig. 5), consistent with the fact that the ability of V15G mutant of Bcl-2 to inhibit staurosporine-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts was totally abrogated (34Lee L.C. Hunter J.J. Mujeeb A. Turck C. Parslow T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23284-23288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). W30S and Y21D mutants also displayed altered capacities to heterodimerize with Bax, although less dramatically than V15E mutant. In contrast, substitution of the serine phosphorylation site S24E displayed a normal pattern of heterodimerization with Bax (Fig. 4). This may rule out the possibility that the altered Bax binding ability of the above point mutations is due to a close location to the phosphorylation site. Taken together, these results suggest that the maintaining the amphipathic nature of the α1 helix in BH4 domain is critical for Bcl-2 to form a heterodimer with Bax and to protect cells from killing. Without hydrophobic surface of BH4, the α1 helix cannot dock on the backside of the Bcl-2 protein and probably the protein alters its conformation so that the hydrophobic pocket, which normally binds the BH3 domain of Bax, is altered. Thus, introducing a charged residue on this hydrophobic face appears to be particularly deleterious to the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2. This may indicate that hydrophobic interactions at the base of the binding pocket of Bcl-2 are more important than electrostatic interactions. These results indicate that the BH4 domain, besides the BH1 and BH2 domains, of Bcl-2 is also essential for heterodimerization with Bax. Our data supported that the interaction of Bcl-2 with Bax is critical for exhibiting its anti-apoptotic activity, whereas we could not rule out that other Bcl-2-interacted proteins may be also involved in BH4 domain function. Our findings provide an opportunity to develop new agents to promote tumor cell apoptosis by interrupting the function of the BH4 domain. We thank Drs. Hiroyuki Suzuki and Shingo Dan for helpful discussions."

Recently, paxillin was also demonstrated to interact with PTP-PEST (Shen, Y., Schneider, G., Cloutier, J. F., Veillette, A., and Schaller, M. D. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 6474–6481). In the present study, we show that amino acids 344–397 of PTP-PEST are sufficient for the binding to paxillin. We demonstrate that a proline-rich segment of PTP-PEST (Pro 2),355PPEPHPVPPILTPSPPSAFP374, is essential for this interaction in vivo. Furthermore, mutation of proline residues within the Pro 2 motif reveal that proline 362 is critical for the binding of paxillin. Conversely, using deletion and point mutants of paxillin, LIM 3 and 4 domains were both found to be necessary for binding of PTP-PEST. Finally, using a “substrate trapping” approach, we demonstrate that, unlike p130Cas, paxillin is not a substrate for PTP-PEST. In conclusion, we show that a novel proline-rich motif found in PTP-PEST serves as a ligand for the LIM domains of paxillin. Interestingly, the focal adhesion targeting of paxillin is mediated by LIM 3. Thus, we propose that PTP-PEST, by a competition with the ligand of paxillin in the focal adhesion complex, could contribute to the removal of paxillin from the adhesion sites and consequently promote focal adhesion turnover.

Protein-tyrosine kinases are involved in the propagation of extracellular signals from a number of trans-membrane receptors. Although some receptors like the epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities. Others such as the integrin and T cell receptor must couple intracellular tyrosine kinases to propagate their signals.

The enzyme is composed of a N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal tail rich in proline stretches that serve as binding sites for other signaling molecules. PTP-PEST has been proposed to influence mitogenic signaling downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor due to its direct association with two key adaptor proteins, Shc and Grb2 (4Habib T. Herrera R. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25243-25246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Charest A. Wagner J. Jacob S. McGlade C.J. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recently, using substrate trapping approaches (7Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), the adaptor protein p130Cas was identified as a substrate of PTP-PEST (8Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of p130Cas as well as those of the related proteins Hef1 and Sin/Efs were shown to directly bind to the Pro 1 of PTP-PEST (9Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Côté J.F. Charest A. Wagner J. Tremblay M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13128-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This interaction thus serves as an additional mechanism to confer specificity to PTP-PEST toward its substrates. p130Cas is a focal adhesion-localized protein whose tyrosine phosphorylation is mainly regulated by integrin engagement via the catalytic activity of p125FAK and c-Src (11Tachibana K. Urano T. Fujita H. Ohashi Y. Kamiguchi K. Iwata S. Hirai H. Morimoto C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29083-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions are the sites of cell contact with the extracellular matrix (for review, see Refs. 12Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholarand 13Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). Proteins found in focal adhesions have either structural or signaling functions. Through the juxtaposition of several enzymes and adaptor proteins such as p125FAK, p130Cas, and Src, the extracellular matrix can connect with the actin-cytoskeleton (12Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Studies on PTP-PEST −/− fibroblasts have demonstrated impaired cell migration (14Angers-Loustau A. Côté J.-F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This is related to the hyperphosphorylation of three focal adhesion-localized proteins, namely p130Cas, p125FAK, and paxillin in the −/− cells. In addition, a higher number of vinculin-containing focal adhesions were observed in the −/− fibroblast, in agreement with increase phosphorylation on tyrosine of the focal adhesion proteins mentioned above. These results indicate a role for PTP-PEST in focal adhesion breakdown and turnover, which are required in events such as cell migration (15Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, it has recently been demonstrated that Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing WT PTP-PEST are not efficient for migration in a wound healing assay due to p130Cas hypophosphorylation (16Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Paxillin is a member of a family of adaptor proteins that also includes Hic-5 (17Shibanuma M. Mochizuki E. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. Imai S. Takano T. Oshimura M. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and leupaxin (18Lipsky B.P. Beals C.R. Staunton D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11709-11713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Located in focal adhesions, paxillin associates with important cytoskeletal proteins such as talin and vinculin as well as protein-tyrosine kinases found in adhesion plaques such as p125FAK, Pyk2, and c-Src (19Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In particular, the association of p125FAK with paxillin has been shown to be essential for focal adhesion targeting of p125FAK (20Tachibana K. Sato T.N.D.A. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, following integrin engagement, paxillin has been demonstrated to be phosphorylated by p125FAK and c-Src (21Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 1: 2635-2645Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar). This creates docking sites for the SH2 domain of the Crk proteins (23Bellis S.L. Miller J.T. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17437-17441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and links the integrin activation to signal transduction pathways via the proteins C3G or SOS that are bound to Crk. In addition to its tyrosine phosphorylation, paxillin is also heavily phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues following plating of cells on fibronectin (24Bellis S.L. Perrotta J.A. Curtis M.S. Turner C.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Serine and threonine phosphorylation of paxillin have been implicated in its targeting to focal adhesions and cellular attachment to fibronectin (25Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1803-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Structurally, paxillin and the paxillin-like proteins are composed of N-terminal LD motifs and four C-terminal LIM domains. The LD motifs of paxillin (reviewed in Ref. 26Brown M.C. Curtis M.S. Turner C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have been shown to be implicated in the paxillin binding to p125FAK and vinculin (19Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). LD motifs have also been observed in a variety of proteins, where they also act as mediating protein-protein interaction (26Brown M.C. Curtis M.S. Turner C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). LIM domains are approximately 50 amino acids in length and known to mediate protein-protein associations (for review, see Refs. 27Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar and 28Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The LIM domains have a conserved consensus sequence: (CXXC(X 16–23)HXXC)XX(CXXC(X 16–21)CXXC/D/H) (28Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Proteins harboring LIM domains often harbor other domains such as homeodomain, kinase, SH3, and LD domains. One of the most characterized LIM domain mediated interaction involves the association of the LIM 3 of Enigma to the tyrosine-based motif (tyrosine tight turn) of the insulin receptor (29Wu R. Durick K. Zhou S. Cantley L.C. Taylor S.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15934-15941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similarly, the LIM 2 of Enigma interacts with the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase (29Wu R. Durick K. Zhou S. Cantley L.C. Taylor S.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15934-15941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These interactions indicate that each LIM domain may indeed recognize and interact with specific protein domains. The LIM domains of paxillin, especially LIM 3, are essential for proper focal adhesion targeting. Although the focal adhesion targeting ligand of LIM 3 has not been identified (19Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), it has recently been shown that LIM 2 and 3 bind protein(s) with serine kinase activity (25Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1803-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In a recent report, paxillin was shown to associate directly with the C-terminal tail of PTP-PEST by a still uncharacterized mechanism (30Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the present study, we reveal that a non-classical proline-rich motif of PTP-PEST (Pro 2) is essential for both in vitro andin vivo binding of PTP-PEST to paxillin. More precisely, mutation of proline 362 to alanine completely abolishes this association. The presence of intact LIM 3 and 4 domains of paxillin were required for its association with PTP-PEST. Finally, using mutants of PTP-PEST which have a C231S mutation, we demonstrate that paxillin is not a substrate for PTP-PEST in a substrate trapping assay. Together, these results demonstrate a novel association between LIM domains and a proline-rich motif. We propose that a physiological function for this association could be that, once PTP-PEST is recruited to adhesion plaques, it could regulate the breakdown and turnover of focal adhesions by dephosphorylating and/or binding proteins such as paxillin, p130Cas, Shc, and Grb2. NIH 3T3, NIH 3T3 overexpressing a Src Y527F constitutively active mutant, and HEK 293T cell lines were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). HEK 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of PTP-PEST plasmid using the calcium phosphate technique as described previously (10Côté J.F. Charest A. Wagner J. Tremblay M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13128-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were pervanadate-treated for 30 min as described previously (10Côté J.F. Charest A. Wagner J. Tremblay M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13128-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies against paxillin (P13520) and p130Cas (P27820) were from Transduction Laboratories. The polyclonal antibody specific for avian paxillin was described previously (19Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The anti-GST and anti-HA tag antibody 12CA5 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies 4G10, PY20, and PY99 were from Upstate Biotechnologies, Transduction Laboratories, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The polyclonal antibody 1075 against PTP-PEST has been described previously (3Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.H. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PTP-PEST cDNA in the expression vector pACTAG (HA epitope-tagged) was described previously (3Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.H. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Pro 1 (331PPKPPR337) and Pro 2 (355PPEPHPVPPILTPSPPSAFP374) domains of PTP-PEST were deleted by PCR. Briefly, an antisense oligonucleotide upstream of the Pro 1 (5′-TCGCTCGAGAGAGTCTTGCTTCTC-3′) designed with aXhoI site was used to amplify the cDNA of PTP-PEST in combination with the sense oligonucleotide T7. This PCR product, encoding for the N terminus of PTP-PEST, was gel-purified (QIAEX II, Qiagen) and digested with NotI and XhoI. A second PCR product encoding for the C terminus of PTP-PEST was generated using a sense oligonucleotide with an XhoI site designed downstream of the Pro 1 (5′-CCACTCGAGACTCGAAGTTGCCTT-3′) and an antisense oligonucleotide with a XbaI site (5′-CCTCTAGATCATGTCCATTCTGAA-3′). The PCR product, encoding for the C terminus of PTP-PEST, was gel-purified and digested withXhoI and XbaI. To reconstitute the full-length PTP-PEST with the deleted Pro 1 region, the digested PCR products encoding for the PTP-PEST N and C terminus domains were ligated in theNotI and XbaI sites of pACTAG. The Pro 2 region of PTP-PEST was deleted using a similar strategy. The deletions were verified by dideoxy sequencing of the mutated region using Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Truncations of the GST PTP-PEST 344–437 (Pro 2) (GST 344–427, 344–417, 344–407, and 344–397) were performed by PCR using T7 primer and PTP-PEST specific oligonucleotides harboring an EcoRI site. The PCR products were digested withBamHI and EcoRI and ligated in theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX RC. GST PTP-PEST 344–385 was generated by digestion of the pGEX RC 344–437 vector withKpnI and EcoRI, treatment with mung bean nuclease, followed by religation of the plasmid. The constructs encoding for the N terminus, C terminus, and LIM 1–4 of avian paxillin fused to GST in the pGEX 2T vector have been described previously(19). The paxillin GST LIM 1–3 was constructed by subcloning from the GST C terminus pGEX 2T construct theBamHI/SacII fragment in pBluescript II (KS). TheBamHI/SacI fragment was then subcloned from pBluescript II (KS) to pGEX RC in the BamHI/SacI sites. The paxillin GST LIM 1–2 of paxillin was constructed by subcloning the BamHI/XbaI fragment from the GST C terminus construct in pGEX RC in the BamHI/XbaI sites. The paxillin GST LIM 3–4 was constructed by subcloning theXmnI/EcoRI fragment from the GST C terminus of paxillin in pGEX 2TK in the SmaI/EcoRI sites. The paxillin GST C terminus ΔLIM 3 was constructed by digesting the paxillin GST C terminus construct with XbaI andSacII, followed by treatment with mung bean nuclease and religation of the plasmid. Eight proline residues (highlighted) found in the Pro 2 domain of PTP-PEST (355PPEPHPVPPILTPSPPSAFP 374) were mutated to alanine residues by PCR. Briefly, mutagenic oligonucleotides were engineered: P358A (5′-CAGCCACCAGAAGCTCACCCGGTGC-3′), P360A (5′-CCAGAACCTCACGCGGTGCCACCCATC-3′), P362A (5′-CCTCACCCGGTGGCACCCATCCTGAC-3′), P363A (5′-CACCCGGTGCCAGCCATCCTGACGC-3′), P367A (5′-CCCATCCTGACGGCATCACCTCCTTC-3′), P369A (5′-CTGACGCCATCAGCTCCTTCAGCC-3′), P370A (5′-ACGCCATCACCTGCTTCAGCCTTCC-3′), P374A (5′-CCTTCAGCCTTCGCAACCGTTACCAC-3′). pGEX RC PTP-PEST Pro 2 (aa 344–437) was used as a templates for the PCR reactions. Each oligonucleotide was used in combination with a pGEX antisense specific oligonucleotide to amplify a portion of the Pro 2 region. The eight different PCR products were gel-purified. A second PCR product was generated using a pGEX-specific sense oligonucleotide in combination with a PTP-PEST-specific antisense primer (5′-CCATGTGCAGCACTGGCTTT-3′) and was recovered by gel purification. In order to reconstitute the full-length Pro 2 region, each mutagenic PCR products was incubated with the second PCR product and a strand overlap extension step was performed with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) for seven cycles using the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Each of the products from the strand overlap extension step was amplified by PCR by adding 100 pmol of the pGEX sense and antisense primers and using the same conditions for 30 cycles. Each of the PCR products was gel-purified and digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated in theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX RC. Following transformation in Escherichia coli DH5α, mutants were screened by DNA sequencing. Using a similar approach, cysteine 523 of paxillin was mutated to a serine. The other mutants of paxillin have been described previously(19). pcDNA3 paxillin WT, ΔLIM3, C467A, C470A, C467/470A, ΔLIM4, C523S, and pcDNA3 were digested with XhoI. The linearized plasmids were used as templates for in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Two μl of the transcription reactions were used to performed in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). The in vitro translated products were tested for binding to 1 μg of GST PTP-PEST 344–397 or GST alone. NIH 3T3, NIH 3T3 Src Y527F, pervanadate-treated NIH 3T3, and HEK 293T cells were lysed in HNMETG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 mm Na3VO4 as described previously (10Côté J.F. Charest A. Wagner J. Tremblay M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13128-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) The lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g in a 4 °C microcentrifuge. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. PTP-PEST, p130Cas, and paxillin GST fusion proteins were expressed by induction for 2 h of exponentially growing bacterial cultures with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and fusion proteins were extracted and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Aliquot of 200–250 μg of cell lysates, precleared with 1 μg of GST alone immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), were incubated with each PTP-PEST GST fusion proteins in 1 ml of HNMETG for 90 min at 4 °C. 200 μg of 293-T extract was incubated with each p130Cas and paxillin GST fusion proteins in 1 ml of HNMETG for 90 min at 4 °C. Following the binding incubation, beads were washed three times in HNTG buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and boiled in SDS sample buffer to elute bound proteins. Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P), bound proteins were detected by Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies. Cell monolayers were lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, and Complete protease inhibitors) directly on the tissue culture dishes on ice for 15 min. The lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16 000 ×g in a microcentrifuge. Aliquots (200–500 μg) of cell extracts were precleared with 20 μl of Protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cleared extracts were incubated with 2 μl of monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody or 1 μl of the polyclonal antibody against avian paxillin for 90 min at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered by addition of 20 μl of Protein A-agarose for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membranes, bound PTP-PEST was detected by Western blotting using the anti-HA antibody 12CA5. Blots were stripped and reblotted with the anti-paxillin antibody to verify equal precipitations. Nonspecific sites of blotted PVDF membranes were blocked in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 1% (v/v) goat serum for 60 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with blots for 60 min at room temperature. The monoclonal antibody anti-paxillin was used at a dilution of 1:10,000. The monoclonal antibodies 12CA5 and 4G10 were used at 1:2000 dilution. The monoclonal antibodies anti-p130Cas, PY20, and PY99 were used at 1:1000 dilution. Blots were washed extensively with TBS-T before incubation with the secondary antibody. The secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was diluted 1:10000 in blocking buffer and incubated with blots for 60 min at room temperature. Following repeated washing in TBS-T, bound primary antibodies were detected using chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). It was recently reported that PTP-PEST and paxillin associate in chicken embryo fibroblasts and Swiss 3T3 cells (30Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To verify that PTP-PEST and paxillin were physically associated in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in lysates of various mouse tissues. As seen in Fig.1, paxillin co-precipitated with PTP-PEST in liver, brain, heart, lung, spleen, and thymus lysates. The highest amounts of PTP-PEST-associated paxillin were found in lung, spleen, and liver. No paxillin was detected in PTP-PEST immunoprecipitate from kidney lysate, since PTP-PEST is expressed in low levels in kidney (31Davidson D. Cloutier J.-F. Gregorieff A. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23455-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, paxillin was not found in preimmune IP made from liver extracts demonstrating the specificity of the association. When the blot was reprobed with a PTP-PEST antibody, comparable amounts of PTP-PEST were found in the precipitates except in the kidney where no signal was detected (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the PTP-PEST-paxillin association described previously in fibroblasts (30Shen Y. Schneider G. Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6474-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) also occurs in vivo in a majority of mouse tissues. In order to define the region of PTP-PEST involved in the binding of paxillin, we have used the non-catalytic C-terminal tail of PTP-PEST in addition to several deletion mutants of PTP-PEST expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig.2 A). The GST PTP-PEST fusion proteins (aa 276–775, 276–613, 276–567, 276–453, and 276–437 or GST alone) bound to glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with 500 μg of proteins extracted from NIH 3T3 cells. Following a binding incubation period, the beads were washed several times and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Associated paxillin was detected by Western blotting. As seen in Fig. 2 B (top panel), paxillin was detected in every binding assay except with GST alone. Coomassie Blue staining of the GST fusion proteins used for the binding assay (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel) was used to demonstrate the integrity of the purified proteins. From these results, the paxillin binding site lies between amino acids 276–437 of PTP-PEST. The only characterized protein-binding domain within aa 276–437 of PTP-PEST is a proline-rich region (Pro 1,333PPKPPR337) that acts as binding site for the SH3 domain of p130Cas, Hef1, Sin, and Grb2 (6Charest A.

Also present in this PTP-PEST fragment is Pro 2 (355PPEPHPVPPILTPSPPSAFP374), which is a 20-amino acid segment rich in proline residues that has no determined function. In order to delimit the minimal region required for binding to paxillin, a binding assay was thus performed using Pro 1, Pro 2 344–437, Pro 2 344–427, Pro 2 344–417, Pro 2 344 -407, Pro 2 344–397, and Pro 2 344–385 of PTP-PEST expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2 A). Paxillin was associated with the Pro 2 344–437, 344–427, 344–417, 344–407, and 344–397 PTP-PEST fusion proteins (Fig. 2 C, top panel). GST Pro 2 344–385, GST Pro 1, GST Pro 5, and GST alone failed to associate with paxillin as seen in Fig. 2 C (top panel). These results suggest that amino acids 344–397 of PTP-PEST are sufficient for its association with paxillin. The Pro 2 domain of PTP-PEST lies between aa 355 and 374. Since the smallest GST Pro 2 fusion protein used in Fig.1 C encodes for aa 344–397, a PTP-PEST mutant lacking Pro 2 was generated to rigorously demonstrate its role in paxillin binding. A binding assay was performed using two paxillin GST fusion proteins: paxillin N (encoding for the LD motifs) and paxillin C (encoding for the 4 LIM domains). These two proteins in addition to GST p"

Within the stress pathway, key signaling kinases, which are activated by protein phosphorylation, have been proposed as thein vivo substrates of PP2C, the prototypical member of the PPM family. Although it is known that these phosphatases require metal cations for activity, the molecular details of these important reactions have not been established. Therefore, here we report a detailed biochemical study to elucidate the kinetic and chemical mechanism of PP2Cα. Steady-state kinetic and product inhibition studies revealed that PP2Cα employs an ordered sequential mechanism, where the metal cations bind before phosphorylated substrate, and phosphate is the last product to be released. The metal-dependent activity of PP2C (as reflected ink cat andk cat/K m), indicated that Fe2+ was 1000-fold better than Mg2+. The pH rate profiles revealed two ionizations critical for catalytic activity. An enzyme ionization with a pK a value of 7 must be unprotonated for catalysis, and an enzyme ionization with a pK a of 9 must be protonated for substrate binding. Brönsted analysis of substrate leaving group pK a indicated that phosphomonoester hydrolysis is rate-limiting at pH 7.0, but not at pH 8.5 where a common step independent of the nature of the substrate and alcohol product limits turnover (k cat). Rapid reaction kinetics between phosphomonoester and PP2C yielded exponential “bursts” of product formation, consistent with phosphate release being the slow catalytic step at pH 8.5. Dephosphorylation of synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to several protein kinases revealed that PP2C displays a strong preference for diphosphorylated peptides in which the phosphorylated residues are in close proximity.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 407-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Although both PP families require divalent cations for activity, the PPM family is often distinguished by its Mg2+ and Mn2+ dependence. PP2C is the defining member of the PPM family. PP2C homologues have been identified in bacteria, plants, yeast, and mammals and appear to have a conserved role in negatively regulating stress response. PP2C was shown to be a negative regulator of two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways involved in stress response, the p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways. Like other MAPK pathways, these consist of a MAPK, a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and a MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK) (2Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). MAPK is phosphorylated on conserved threonine and tyrosine residues by the activated MAPKK. The MAPKK is activated by phosphorylation on conserved threonine and/or serine residues by the MAPKKK. The stress response pathways are activated by proinflammatory cytokines, osmotic shock, oxidative stress, UV irradiation, and heat shock (3Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 4Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). PP2C is thought to directly dephosphorylate and inactivate protein kinases at several levels in the pathway. The PP2C homologue, MP2C, functions as a negative regulator of a stress-activated pathway in plants. By a yeast genetic analysis, the molecular target of MP2C was determined to be the MAPKKK Ste11 (5Meskiene I. Bogre L. Glaser W. Balog J. Brandstotter M. Zwerger K. Ammerer G. Hirt H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1938-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). MKK6 and SEK 1, both MAPKKs important in stress response signaling pathways, have been identified as PP2C substrates (6Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Additional MAPKKs have also been suggested to be PP2C substrates (7Hanada M. Kobayashi T. Ohnishi M. Ikeda S. Wang H. Katsura K. Yanagawa Y. Hiraga A. Kanamaru R. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PP2Cα has been shown to dephosphorylate and inactivate the MAPK p38 (6Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Genetic studies with PP2C yeast homologues Ptc1, Ptc2, and Ptc3 (8Shiozaki K. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Gaits F. Shiozaki K. Russell P. J.

Collectively, these studies demonstrate a major role for PP2C in turning off, or resetting, the stress response pathways. Unlike the PPP family of protein phosphatases, there are no known specific inhibitors of PP2C and no regulatory subunits have been identified.

Helps N.R. Cohen P.T. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and reveals a central β-sandwich surrounded by α-helices. The active site is located at one end of this β-sandwich and is composed of several invariant carboxylates, which serve as metal-coordinating residues. There are two hexa-coordinated metal sites, M1 and M2, which are 4 Å apart and share a water molecule and the carboxylate side chain of Asp-60. Site M1 is coordinated by 3 water molecules and two additional aspartic acids, Asp-239 and Asp-282. Site M2 is coordinated by 4 water molecules and makes only two direct contacts with the protein, at the backbone carbonyl of Gly-61 and at the bridging Asp-60. The presence of bound phosphate in the x-ray structure suggested the importance of an active site Arg-33. This arginine appears to position the phosphate near the water molecule bridged by the two metal ions. Das et al. (10Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) have proposed that catalysis proceeds by direct attack of an activated water molecule at the phosphorus center of substrate. Except for this crystallographic study, very little mechanistic data are available for this important class of enzymes. Here we describe a detailed kinetic investigation of human PP2Cα, the archetypal member of the PPM family of protein phosphatases. In this study, we explore the metal-dependent activation, identify critical enzyme ionizations, determine the kinetic mechanism, determine the rate-limiting step in catalysis and probe substrate specificity. All chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Peptides were from the University of Michigan Protein Core facility. The Fe2+ chelator, 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis(4-phenylsulfonic acid)-1,2,4-triazine (ferrozine), was obtained from Sigma. The plasmid pCW-PP2Cα was a generous gift from Dr. Patricia T. W. Cohen (Dundee University). The enzyme was purified according to the method described (11Davies S.P. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) with several modifications. The pCW-PP2Cα plasmid was used to transform competent BL21/DE3 bacteria. The transformed bacteria were grown on 2× YT plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Overnight 10-ml cultures originating from isolated colonies were used to inoculate 1 liter of 2× YT containing 140 mg/liter ampicillin. When the growth reached an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm, 100 mg/liter isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the bacteria were grown for an additional 10 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g(15 min), resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.03% (v/v) Brij-35), and lysed by French press. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 48,000 × g(20 min), the supernatant decanted, and the protein precipitated between 30% and 55% saturation with (NH4)2SO4. The pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of buffer B (20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (v/v) Brij-35) and dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer B for at least 2 h with one change in buffer. The dialysate was loaded onto a 50-ml Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) anion exchange column pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The column was then washed with 250 ml of buffer B, and the enzyme was eluted with a 0–0.4 m linear NaCl gradient of 400 ml. PP2Cα elutes at 250 mm NaCl. Fractions containing high phosphatase activity with para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) were pooled and concentrated to between 5 and 10 ml by ultrafiltration (Centricon 10 concentrator by Amicon). The concentrated solution was dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer containing 25 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 1m (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm EDTA for at least 1 h with one change of buffer and then loaded onto a 50-ml Phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) hydrophobic column. The column was then washed with 250 ml of this buffer and eluted with a 1–0 mlinear (NH4)2SO4 gradient of 400 ml. PP2Cα elutes at 200 mm(NH4)2SO4. Fractions with phosphatase activity were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine purity. Fractions of highest purity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration to a final concentration of 0.04 to 0.4 mm. PP2Cα was dialyzed against 1 liter of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmDTT, 2 mm EDTA for 2 h with a change after 1 h, followed by a final dialysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT for 2 h with one change. The EDTA was included to obtain metal free (apo)-PP2C. EDTA is effective in completely removing bound metal cations, as was evident from the apo-PP2C x-ray structure, which revealed a virtually identical structure to that of holoenzyme (10Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The enzyme was stored at −20 °C or −80 °C until use. All assays were carried out in a reaction buffer containing 0.05 m Tris, 0.05 m Bis-Tris, and 0.1 m acetate at 25 °C. To determine the kinetic parameters k cat andk cat/K m, the initial velocities were measured at various substrate concentrations, and the data were fitted to Equation 1. The computer program KinetAsyst (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA) was used for fitting kinetic data to Equations 1-7. Three types of assays were used to monitor PP2C phosphatase activity and are described below. Because of its relative stability and high specific activity, the divalent cation Mn2+ was utilized for the majority of the kinetic studies. The metal cation Fe2+ was largely avoided due to difficulties with oxidation. For the phosphate inhibition and pH dependence studies, the cation Mg2+ was used to avoid the precipitation that occurs with Mn2+ in the presence of phosphate and at high pH. The continuous assay monitoring the dephosphorylation of pNPP was performed using a temperature-controlled Shimadzu BioSpec-1601 UV-visible spectrophotometer and monitoring the absorbance change recorded at 410 nm, pH 7.0. Initial linear rates were determined using the molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 9 mm−1cm−1 for the product para-nitrophenol (pNP) at pH 7.0. Two end point assays were also used to measure PP2C activity. The phosphate detection assay was used for measuring the initial linear rates of dephosphorylation of peptides, amino acids, and aryl substrates. The release of phosphate was determined using the colorimetric method described by Brotheruset al. (12Brotherus J.R. Jacobsen L. Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 731: 290-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which measures the formation of phosphomolybdate complexes at 850 nm. Briefly, reaction mixtures of 600 μl were stopped with 1 ml of 0.5 n HCl containing 30 mg of ascorbic acid, 5 mg of ammonium heptamolybdate, and 10 mg of SDS. For color development, 1.5 ml containing 30 mg of sodium arsenite, 30 mg of sodium citrate, and 30 μl glacial acetic acid were added and the absorbance was read at 850 nm. The other end point assay was developed to determine the rate of pNPP hydrolysis for the pH profile using the molar extinction coefficient of 18,000m−1 cm−1 for pNP at basic pH values. This assay was developed after the method described in Ref. 13Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, which utilizes a stop solution containing 1 nNaOH. To prevent the precipitation of metal which occurs upon the addition of 1 n NaOH to a PP2C reaction mixture, a stop solution containing 0.5 m EDTA, pH 10, was used. A comparison of the continuous assay and the two end point assays revealed that these three assays yielded identical rates. v=(kcat·S)/(Km+S)Equation 1 Various concentrations of metal ions were combined with apo-PP2C and allowed to incubate for 2 min. The phosphatase reaction was initiated by the addition of pNPP to a final concentration of 20 mm and activity was measured using the continuous assay. The inhibition constants for Ca2+ and Zn2+ were determined by adding various amounts of MnCl2 at fixed concentrations of the inhibiting metal ion at saturating levels of pNPP. The data were fitted to Equation 2 to yield the inhibition constant. The inhibition was competitive with respect to Mn2+. v=(kcat·S)/[Km·(1+I/Kis)+S]Equation 2 I is the inhibitor concentration and S is the Mn2+ concentration, and K is is the inhibition constant. A reaction mixture containing 3 mm Fe2+, 4 mm pNPP, and 0.59 μm PP2C was separated into two cuvettes. One was monitored for phosphatase activity using the continuous assay, and the other was used to monitor the Fe2+ concentration during the course of the reaction. The Fe2+ concentration was determined using the Fe2+ specific chelator, ferrozine, which has a characteristic absorbance at 562 nm. The measured Fe2+ concentrations and PP2C activity were plottedversus time using the computer program KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck Software). The end point assay using the EDTA stop solution was used to measure the pH dependence of PP2C activity. For the construction of the pH profiles,k cat andk cat/K pNPP were obtained at various pH values with pNPP as the varied substrate at saturating levels of Mn2+ (10 mm) or Mg2+ (40 mm). The pH data for Mn2+and Mg2+ were fitted to Equations 3 and 4, respectively, where C is the pH-independent value of eitherk cat ork cat/K pNPP; H is the proton concentration; and K a andKb are the ionization constants of the groups involved in the reaction. v=C/(1+H/Ka)Equation 3 v=C/(1+H/Ka+Kb/H)Equation 4 The catalytic mechanism of PP2C was determined by performing bisubstrate studies treating the metal cation as a pseudo-substrate. Continuous assays were performed by varying the amounts ofpNPP at fixed levels of Mn2+ and the data were fitted to Eq. 5 where K a andKbare the Michaelis constants forpNPP and Mn2+, respectively. v=[kcat·A·B/(Kia·Kb+Ka·B+Kb·A+A·B)]Equation 5 The Pi product inhibition of PP2C was analyzed with Mg2+ to avoid the precipitation of Mn2+ and Pi. Continuous assays were performed by varying Mg2+ or pNPP in saturating levels of the other substrate at fixed concentrations of the product Pi. The inhibition of Pi with respect to pNPP was competitive, and the data were fitted to Equation 2; in contrast, the inhibition of Pi with respect to metal was uncompetitive, and the data were fitted to Equation 6. v=[kcat·S/(Km+S·(1+I/Kii))]Equation 6 The leaving group dependence of PP2C was analyzed by determining the dephosphorylation rate of several artificial compounds, which differ by the pK a of the leaving group. Substrates 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) (pK a = 4.9), pNPP (7.1), 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (7.8), β-naphthyl phosphate (9.38), phenyl phosphate (9.99), phosphoserine (14.1) (Ref. 14Kyte J. Mechanism in Protein Chemistry. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar), and phosphothreonine in the peptide GIPIRVY(pT)HEV (15.0) (Ref. 14Kyte J. Mechanism in Protein Chemistry. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) were analyzed using the phosphate detection assay at pH 7.0 and 8.5. Brönsted values were obtained by linear least-squares fitting of log (k cat) versuspK a of leaving group for the substrates using the computer program KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck Software.) Enzyme and substrate were rapidly mixed at pH 8.5 and 25 °C in a temperature-controlled SF-61 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Hi-Tech Scientific). The absorbance ofpNP and DiFMU were monitored at 410 nm and 358 nm, respectively. The enzyme was combined with Mn2+ in reaction buffer, pH 8.5, prior to rapid mixing with the substrate also diluted into reaction buffer, pH 8.5. The final concentration of Mn2+ was 10 mm. The data were fitted to Equation 7 using the nonlinear least-squares fitting capability of the kinetics software (KinetAsyst, Hi-Tech Ltd, Salisbury, U.K.) whereA is the amplitude of the burst, k is the first-order rate of the burst, B is the slope of the linear portion of the curve, C is the intercept of the line, andt is time. Absorbance=A·e(−kt)+B·t+CEquation 7 The amplitude was converted to concentration of pNP using the ε410 of 18 mm−1cm−1. The correlation between the concentration ofpNP burst and the final enzyme concentration was determined by linear least-squares fitting. The following phosphopeptides were analyzed as PP2C substrates using the phosphate detection assay: GIPIRVYpTHEV, corresponding to Cdc2 kinase (15Lee M.G. Nurse P.

The hydrolysis of phosphotyrosine peptide KIGEGTpYGVVYK was monitored at 282 nm and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1 was employed as the positive assay control. Dephosphorylation rates were determined in 10 mm Mn2+ at various peptide concentrations, pH 7.0 and 25 °C. The nature of the metal cation has been suggested to be important for regulating the activity of PP2C (18Pato M.D. Kerc E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 101: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To explore which divalent cations are effective in activating PP2C,k cat andk cat/K m values were determined for several divalent cations at saturating pNPP concentrations. The k cat constant is the first-order rate constant and reflects the rate-determining step in the overall reaction. The k cat reveals the maximal turnover rate of substrate in saturating levels of the metal ion being analyzed. The k cat/K m is the apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction between free enzyme and free substrate and includes the binding of substrate through the first irreversible step. Thek cat/K metal parameter reveals the specificity of PP2C and suggests which metal ions are preferred for catalysis. The fact that the metal ion concentration obeys Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics (Fig.1) suggests that the metal ions are acting as pseudo-substrates. Although PP2C has been defined by its Mg2+ and Mn2+ dependence, these two metals do not activate PP2C to the same extent. A 25-fold higher k cat value and 370-fold higher k cat/K m value were observed with Mn2+ compared with Mg2+(Table I). Surprisingly, Fe2+resulted in the greatest activity of all metal ions analyzed, with a 500-fold higher k cat value and a 1,800-fold greater k cat/K metal value compared with Mg2+. A 7-fold higherk cat value and 20-fold greaterk cat/K metal value were observed with Co2+, as compared with Mg2+. Ak cat value was not determined with Cu2+ due to precipitation at Cu2+ levels below enzyme saturation; however, at low concentrations of Cu2+, the k cat/K metal was determined by calculating the slope of the initial rateversus low Cu2+ concentrations. When PP2C activity was measured with Ni2+, thek cat andk cat/K metal values were 6-fold lower than those obtained with Mg2+. No activity was detected with Ca2+ or Zn2+. These ions were found to competitively inhibit the PP2C Mn2+-dependent activity. By varying the Mn2+ concentration at fixed levels of either Ca2+ or Zn2+, a fit to Equation 2 yieldedK i values of 4.45 ± 0.54 mm and 12.0 ± 1.8 μm for Ca2+ and Zn2+, respectively.Table IHuman PP2Cα metal dependenceMetal ionk catK metalk cat/K metals −1mmm −1 s −1Mn2+0.96 ± 0.011.42 ± 0.08670.0 ± 30.0Mg2+0.038 ± 0.00220.6 ± 1.71.80 ± 0.10Fe2+21.5 ± 3.36.56 ± 2.263290.0 ± 660.0Co2+0.30 ± 0.057.2 ± 2.442.0 ± 7.0Cu2+NDaND, not determined.

To determine the oxidation state of iron required for PP2C activity, the Fe2+ detector ferrozine, was used to monitor the effective concentration of Fe2+ in the phosphatase assay. PP2C activity in a parallel reaction was recorded at specific time points and related to the free Fe2+ concentration (Fig.2). A direct relationship between loss in Fe2+ cation (due to oxidation to Fe3+) and loss in activity was observed. To determine the ionizations important for catalysis and substrate binding, the k cat andk cat/K pNPP values were obtained at various pH values and saturating concentrations of either Mn2+ or Mg2+. The plot ofk cat versus pH obtained in Mn2+ revealed one ionization that must be unprotonated for catalysis and has a pK a value of 7.00 ± 0.09 (Fig. 3 A). The pH-independentk cat value (C) was 2.21 ± 0.65 s−1. Thek cat/K pNPP pH profile obtained in Mn2+ also exhibited an ionization that must be unprotonated for catalysis, with a pK a value of 7.18 ± 0.08 (Fig. 3 B). The pH-independentk cat/K pNPP value was 1,280 ± 314 m−1 s−1. Due to precipitation of Mn2+ at basic pH values, data could not be collected at pH values higher than 8.5. However, difficulties with precipitation were not encountered with Mg2+. This allowed us to measure the Mg2+-dependent rates above pH 8.5. The plot of k cat versus pH obtained with Mg2+ revealed an ionization that must be unprotonated for catalysis with a pK a value of 7.42 ± 0.09 (Fig. 4 A) and a pH-independent value of 0.11 ± 0.01 s−1. With Mg2+, thek cat/K pNPP pH profile revealed a second critical ionization that must be protonated for activity and has a pK a value of 8.96 ± 0.12 (Fig. 4 B). The pH-independentk cat/K pNPP value was 20.3 ± 3.2 m−1 s−1.Figure 4Effect of pH on thek cat andk cat/K pNPPparameters at saturating Mg2+. Thek cat andk cat/K m values were determined by varying the concentration of pNPP in saturating Mg2+ at the indicated pH values and fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The pH data fork cat (panel A) were fitted using the equation v = C/(1 + H/K a) and yielded a pK a value of 7.42 ± 0.09. The pH data fork cat/K m (panel B) was fitted using the equation v =C/(1 + H/K a + K b/H), yielding pK a values of 7.23 ± 0.12 and 8.96 ± 0.12. The assay conditions were 0.1 m acetate, 0.05 m Tris, 0.05 m Bis-Tris at 25 °C in saturating Mg2+ (40 mm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Bisubstrate studies were performed to determine the kinetic mechanism of PP2C and to probe the order of substrate binding. The concentration of pNPP was varied at fixed concentrations of Mn2+ and the double-reciprocal plot of 1/v versus1/[pNPP] was constructed for each fixed concentration of Mn2+ (Fig. 5). A series of lines that intersect to the left of the vertical axis and above the horizontal axis were obtained, suggesting a sequential mechanism. In a sequential mechanism, both substrates must bind before catalysis can occur. Thus, PP2C forms a ternary complex with metal and the phosphomonoester substrate prior to catalysis. To determine the order of substrate binding and product release, product inhibition studies were performed. The concentration ofpNPP was varied at fixed levels of Pi and saturating levels of Mg2+. The double-reciprocal plot revealed a series of lines that intersect at the vertical axis, demonstrating that the inhibition is competitive (Fig.6 A). The inhibition constantKis was determined to be 0.67 ± 0.05 mm. The concentration of Mg2+ was varied a"

The protein is a member of the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding protein fold family, being composed of a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet rolled over on itself to form a closed β-barrel with two short α-helices packed onto one face.The aim of this study was to identify residues in human N-TIMP-2 that are responsible for specific binding to MMPs with a view to further understanding the mechanism of inhibition of MMPs by TIMPs. This was approached by a process of rational modification using site-directed mutagenesis. Initially, mutations were chosen by modelling the solution structure of N-TIMP-2 using Rasmol (Molecular Graphics). Residues such as Tyr36, Glu57, Lys58, Asp59, Glu91, and Asp93 appeared in the structure as prominent surface residues. Further mutagenesis was based on information emerging from several structural studies on TIMP-MMP complexes: (i) residues identified at the enzyme-inhibitor interface in the N-MMP-3/TIMP-1 crystal structure (21Gomis-Rüth F.X.

Refolded MMP-14 was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and eluted with 100 mm imidazole in buffer, followed by dialysis. During the dialysis step some processing of the refolded MMP-14 was observed, with a shift in molecular mass corresponding to the loss of the N-terminal His tag-vector sequences. Activation of proMMP-14 was performed by autoproteolysis at 37 °C for 15 min. Refolded active MMP-14 showed collagenolytic activity versus soluble type I collagen. The integrity of the C-terminal domain is essential for collagenolytic activity; therefore correct folding is implicated (not shown) (34d'Ortho M.P. Will H. Atkinson S. Butler G. Messent A.

The tryptic digests (50–100 μg) were resolved on a C18 reverse-phase column (Vydac 218TP54) at 40 °C. The column was equilibrated with solvent A (0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water) prior to loading and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–50% solvent B (0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over 60 min. The flow rate was constant at 1 ml/min, and the absorbance at 220 nm was monitored.Kinetic AnalysesAll enzyme concentrations were determined by titration using standardized preparations of TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 (18Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For N-TIMP-2 mutants, titration was carried out against several enzymes to ensure that an accurate estimate of concentration was obtained. All kinetic experiments were performed in fluorimetry assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35) using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter with a thermostatically controlled cuvette holder set to either 25 or 37 °C. Enzyme activity was assessed by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of 1 μm quenched fluorescent substrate (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl) acetyl-Pro-Leu-Ala-norvalyl-[3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropionyl]-Ala-Arg-NH2for MMP-3 or (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-[3-(2, 4-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropionyl]-Ala-Arg-NH2for the other MMPs (35Knight C.G.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar).Association rate constants (k on) were determined by following the rate of inhibition of MMP activity by N-TIMP-2 using a continuous fluorimetric enzyme activity assay. The association rate constant was estimated from the progress curves using published equations and the program Grafit (18Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P.

N-TIMP-2 (1–100 nm) was incubated with MMP-7 (1 nm) for 3 h or overnight at room temperature before 10-fold dilution into the substrate solution (1 μm). The reaction was followed at 37 °C until a steady state rate could be measured. Initial nonlinear rate data were deleted, and the steady state rates were plotted against TIMP concentration. A curve was fitted using a tight bindingK i equation and Grafit (36Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, version 3.0.

Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Alternatively, MMP-7 (0.1 nm) was incubated overnight at 37 °C with increasing amounts of N-TIMP-2 at the final assay volume. 1 μm (final concentration) substrate was added, the solution was transferred to the cuvette (without dilution), and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was measured. The Kiapp was determined as above. The two methods (dilution versus nondilution) gave the same Kiapp; therefore, the latter method, where enzyme and inhibitor are incubated in the final volume, was used routinely for the other MMPs. Where possible, the Kiapp was measured at several enzyme concentrations below the apparent K i to ensure that a true value was obtained. The time required for attainment of equilibrium was estimated by incubating the enzyme and inhibitor for various periods of time and measuring the rate of quenched fluorescent substrate cleavage: a linear, rather than curved plot of substrate cleaved versus time was indicative of equilibrium being reached. It was necessary to incubate MMP-13 (3–120 pm) with N-TIMP-2 overnight at 37 °C, whereas MMP-2 (10–20 pm) and MMP-14 (100 pm) were incubated overnight at room temperature.

The protein is a member of the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding protein fold family, being composed of a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet rolled over on itself to form a closed β-barrel with two short α-helices packed onto one face. The aim of this study was to identify residues in human N-TIMP-2 that are responsible for specific binding to MMPs with a view to further understanding the mechanism of inhibition of MMPs by TIMPs. This was approached by a process of rational modification using site-directed mutagenesis. Initially, mutations were chosen by modelling the solution structure of N-TIMP-2 using Rasmol (Molecular Graphics). Residues such as Tyr36, Glu57, Lys58, Asp59, Glu91, and Asp93 appeared in the structure as prominent surface residues. Further mutagenesis was based on information emerging from several structural studies on TIMP-MMP complexes: (i) residues identified at the enzyme-inhibitor interface in the N-MMP-3/TIMP-1 crystal structure (21Gomis-Rüth F.X.

https://openalex.org/W2090431078,"Prostaglandin H synthase isoform-1 (PGHS-1) cyclooxygenase activity has a cooperative response to arachidonate concentration, whereas the second isoform, PGHS-2, exhibits saturable kinetics. The basis for the cooperative PGHS-1 behavior and for the difference in cooperativity between the isoforms was unclear. The two cyclooxygenase activities have different efficiencies of feedback activation by hydroperoxide. To determine whether the cooperative kinetics were governed by the feedback activation characteristics, we examined the cyclooxygenase activities under conditions where feedback activation was either assisted (by exogenous peroxide) or impaired (by replacement of heme with mangano protoporphyrin IX to form MnPGHS-1 and -2). Heme replacement increased PGHS-1 cyclooxygenase cooperativity and changed PGHS-2 cyclooxygenase kinetics from saturable to cooperative. Peroxide addition decreased or abolished cyclooxygenase cooperativity in PGHS-1, MnPGHS-1, and MnPGHS-2. Kinetic simulations predicted that cyclooxygenase cooperativity depends on the hydroperoxide activator requirement and initial peroxide concentration, consistent with observed behavior. The results indicate that PGHS-1 cyclooxygenase cooperativity originates in the feedback activation kinetics and that the cooperativity difference between the isoforms can be explained by the difference in feedback activation loop efficiency. This linkage between activation efficiency and cyclooxygenase cooperativity indicates an interdependence between fatty acid and hydroperoxide levels in controlling the synthesis of potent prostanoid mediators."

CCK-AR has important physiological functions in the central nervous system (stimulation of satiety) and in peripheral organs, particularly in the gut (stimulation of gall bladder contraction, pancreatic secretions, and digestive motility) (3Silvente-Poirot S. Dufresne M. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). CCK-AR, like other G protein-coupled receptors, may be involved in the development of certain pathologies in humans and as such is an important target for therapeutic intervention involving the pharmacological blockade or activation of the receptor using appropriate ligands (4Wank S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G607-G613PubMed Google Scholar, 5Inoue H. Iannotti C.A. Welling C.M. Veile R. Donis-Keller H. Permutt M.A. Genomics. 1997; 42: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The natural ligand of CCK-AR, CCK, is composed of several molecular variants, the octapeptide (CCK-8) being the major fully active one (6Rehfeld J.F. van Solinge W.W. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 63: 295-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Posttranslational processing of CCK involves sulfation of the tyrosine at position seven from the C-terminal and α-amidation of the C-terminal phenylalanine residue (7Beinfeld M.C. Life Sci. 1997; 61: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Studies using synthetic fragments have shown that this sulfation and the amidation of the octapeptide are required for full biological activity and that the C-terminal tetrapeptide Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2 corresponds to the minimal fragment endowed with biological activity (8Jensen R.T. Lemp G.F. Gardner J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5554-5559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elimination of the carboxy-amidated phenylalanine in CCK switches the activity of the molecule from a full agonist on pancreatic amylase secretion to a partial agonist or an antagonist according to the animal species used (9Howard J.M.

These studies suggest that interactions between the C-terminal amidated phenylalanine of CCK and so far unknown amino acid(s) within the CCK-AR agonist binding site are important for full activation of the receptor. The tryptophan and aspartic acid within the C-terminal tetrapeptide of CCK are also key amino acids (16Rolland M. Rodriguez M. Lignon M.F. Galas M.C. Laur J. Aumelas A. Martinez J. Int. J. Pept.

The structure of several classes of CCK-AR antagonists and agonists contain structural elements that resemble tryptophan and aspartic acid side-chains, suggesting that all ligands may share determinants of the CCK-AR binding site (3Silvente-Poirot S.

Data from these studies led to the conclusion that G protein-coupled receptors for neuropeptides have determinants of their agonist binding sites located both in extracellular regions and within the transmembrane domains (19Fong T.M.

For CCK-AR, several lines of evidence support the view that its binding site for CCK comprises amino acids located in extracellular domains. Indeed, the removal of the first 43 amino acids of CCK-AR, and more recently, the mutation of two residues located at the top of the first transmembrane segment, (i.e. Trp-39 and Gln-40) were found to decrease the affinity of the CCK agonist but not that of nonpeptide antagonists (22Kennedy K.

In latter study, we showed that receptors mutated at positions 39 and 40 exhibited decreased affinities for CCK octa- and nonapeptide but did bind CCK heptapeptide with the same affinity as the wild-type receptor. These data were interpreted as providing a strong indication that Trp-39 and Gln-40 are part of the CCK binding site by interacting directly the N-terminal portion of CCK. Using these data and molecular dynamics-based ligand docking, two additional residues, Met-195 and Arg-197, located in the second extracellular loop, were recently identified as part of the agonist binding site because they interact with the sulfated tyrosine of CCK, which is crucial for binding and activity of CCK (24Gigoux V.

Sci. 1998; 43: 1884Google Scholar).Identification of amino acids of CCK-AR that interact with the C-terminal moiety of CCK represents one of the prerequisites for the understanding of how CCK signal is converted into receptor activation. Here, we present important new data that identify residues Arg-336 and Asn-333 as part of the CCK-AR agonist binding site. These amino acids, which are located at the top of transmembrane segment VI, are interacting with the aspartic acid carboxylate and the C-terminal amide of CCK, respectively, which are crucial for binding and activity. In addition, these amino acids are involved differentially in the binding site of peptide and nonpeptide antagonists of CCK-AR, supporting the existence of binding sites for individual agonists/antagonists, which may or may not overlap.DISCUSSIONIn the current study, we have identified two new residues, Arg-336 and Asn-333 of the human CCK-AR, that are crucial for binding and biological activity of CCK. We have demonstrated that these two amino acids interact with the Asp-8 side-chain and C-terminal amide of CCK, respectively, and that they play a crucial role in both the binding and functional properties of CCK-AR. In addition we have shown that, unlike previously identified amino acids (Trp-39/Gln-40 and Met-195/Arg-197) (23Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D.

For this optimization, we constrained the CCK peptide through interactions between Trp-39 and Gln-40, located at the upper part of the first transmembrane domain and the N-terminal moiety of CCK, and between Met-195 and Arg-197, located within the second extracellular loop and the sulfated tyrosine of CCK (23Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol.

This procedure allowed us to position the Asp-8 carboxylate side-chain of CCK in interaction with the Arg-336 guanidium and the C-terminal amide of CCK in contact with Asn-333. Exchange of Arg-336 and Asn-333 for amino acids lacking the chemical functions expected to interact with CCK resulted in dramatic decreases in both the affinity of CCK-AR for CCK and of its potency to mediate CCK-stimulated production of inositol phosphates. These experimental data suggested that Arg-336 and Asn-333 are involved in the CCK-AR binding site for CCK. Because the observed losses in function are not sufficient to distinguish between direct and indirect effects caused by the mutations, additional experiments were conducted.Experimental data demonstrating the interaction between Arg-336 and the Asp-8 carboxylate of CCK were obtained. First, binding experiments revealed that exchange of Arg-336 for a Met strongly affected the affinity of the CCK-AR mutant for CCK-related peptides containing an Asp carboxylate, whereas affinity for (Ala8)-CCK remained nearly constant. Second, exchange of Arg-336 of CCK-AR for an Asp caused a decrease in the potency of the mutated receptor when stimulated by unmodified CCK that was equal to that observed when the wild-type CCK-AR was stimulated by the CCK analogue having Asp-8 substituted by an Arg. This decrease in potency was larger than those obtained when Arg-336 and Asp-8 were individually exchanged for noncharged residues, clearly indicating that they result from repulsive forces that were introduced in the CCK-AR·CCK complexes. Third, and more importantly, the simultaneous double mutation Arg-336 → Asp in CCK-AR and Asp-8 → Arg in CCK yielded a CCK-AR·CCK complex ((R336D)-CCK-AR·(Arg-8)-CCK), the affinity of which was identical to that resulting from CCK binding to the very low affinity state of the wild-type CCK-AR ((WT)-CCK-AR·CCK). The specific and direct roles of Arg-336 in the CCK-AR binding site was further supported by the differential effect of its mutation on antagonist binding. Indeed, Arg-336 mutation caused stronger changes in receptor affinity for CCK-related peptides and SR-27897 than for L-364,718. Structural differences between these compounds account for such data because only CCK-related peptides and SR-27,897 contain a carboxylate residue (Fig.3).Experimental data also support the fact that Asn-333 is the amino acid of the CCK-AR binding site that interacts with the C-terminal amide of CCK. Indeed, functional analysis of (N333A)-CCK-AR indicated that, in contrast to (WT)-CCK-AR, the mutant poorly discriminated between (PheCH3)-CCK and unmodified CCK. It also responded to (PheCH3)-CCK with only a 2-fold lower potency than did (WT)-CCK-AR, whereas it responded to unmodified CCK with 1350-fold lower potency than (WT)-CCK-AR. Moreover, (N333A)-CCK-AR bound125I-BH-JMV 179, the structure of which is lacking the C-terminal amide as (WT)-CCK-AR (Fig. 3). The binding properties of (N333A)-CCK-AR toward nonpeptide antagonists that possess a carboxyamide moiety are clearly in favor of an interaction between Asn-333 and the carboxyamide of CCK ligands. Indeed, (N333A)-CCK-AR had a decreased affinity for SR-27,897 as well as for L-364,718, suggesting that Asn-333 is a crucial residue of the CCK-AR binding site shared by CCK and the nonpeptide antagonists SR-27,897 and L-364,718.To our knowledge, Arg-336 of CCK-AR has not been previously mutated by others. In contrast, mutation of an Asn residue of the rat CCK-AR that corresponds to Asn-333 in the human CCK-AR was reported to affect receptor sensitivity to both agonist (CCK) and nonpeptide antagonist (L-364,718). The authors suggested that the observed effects were due to receptor expression default (33Smeets R.L. Ap I.J. Hermsen H.P. Ophorst O.J. Van Emst-de Vries S.E. De Pont J.J. Willems P.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 325: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The results from our study confirmed that exchange of Asn-333 for an Ala diminishes receptor expression at the cell surface. More importantly, they demonstrated direct involvement of Asn-333 in ligand recognition. In the human CCK-B/GR, exchange of Asn-353, homologous to Asn-333 of the human CCK-AR, for an Ala decreased affinity of the receptor for CCK (34Blaker M. Ren Y. Gordon M.C. Hsu J.E. Beinborn M. Kopin A.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35Kopin A.S. McBride E.W. Quinn S.M. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Beinborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5019-5023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis data so far available on the CCK-B/GR indicate that the CCK binding site of this receptor probably differs from that of CCK-AR, although it presents some similarities. Other authors who have mutated numerous amino acids in transmembrane domains of the CCK-B/GR have demonstrated that these amino acids did not play a critical role in CCK binding. In contrast, several amino acids within extracellular regions, particularly at the top of the first transmembrane domain and in the first and second extracellular loops, were found to be critical for CCK binding and activity (36Silvente-Poirot S. Escrieut C. Wank S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). According to these different reports, the major energetic contribution to CCK binding to CCK-B/GR is likely to be conferred by extracellular residues. In CCK-AR, in addition to amino acids from extracellular regions (Trp-39/Gln-40 and Met-195/Arg-197), Asn-333 and Arg-336, which are located at the top of the sixth transmembrane domain, strongly contribute to CCK recognition.Pharmacological and functional data showing the importance of Arg-336-Asp-8 and Asn-333-amide interactions are in agreement with the first structure/function studies on CCK peptides using biological models naturally expressing CCK-AR. Indeed, it was shown that substitution of the Asp equivalent to Asp-8 of CCK-9 used in the current work by an Ala, a Glu, or a β-Ala decreases biological potency of CCK on gall bladder and pancreatic acinar cells by several hundred fold (17Pan G.Z. Martinez J. Bodanszky M. Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 678: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Gardner J.D. Conlon T.P. Kleveman H.L. Adams T.D.

Dis. 1970; 15: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, the importance of the C-terminal amide for biological activity of CCK has been demonstrated in structure-function studies with a series of CCK peptides having modified C termini. In fact, CCK peptides in which the C-terminal phenylalanine was replaced by a phenylethylamide (Boc-Tyr(SO3H)-Nle-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-NH-CH2CH2-C6H5) stimulated amylase release from rat pancreatic acini with a 1000-fold lower potency than amidated CCK, whereas it had only a 50-fold lower affinity for CCK-AR (11Galas M.C. Lignon M.F. Rodriguez M. Mendre C. Fulcrand P. Laur J. Martinez J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G176-G182PubMed Google Scholar). JMV 180 is the most commonly used peptide of this series of CCK analogues. JMV 180 has its C-terminal phenylalanine substituted by a phenylethyl ester (Fig. 3). It was shown that JMV 180 binds to native rat pancreatic CCK-AR with a 10-fold lower affinity than amidated CCK and that it behaves as a partial agonist on amylase release (11Galas M.C. Lignon M.F. Rodriguez M. Mendre C. Fulcrand P. Laur J. Martinez J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G176-G182PubMed Google Scholar, 15Williams J.A. Blevins Jr., G.T. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 701-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 39Lignon M.F. Galas M.C. Rodriguez M. Martinez J. Cell Signal. 1990; 2: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although it is well recognized that JMV 180 induces distinct pharmacological effects and intracellular signals from CCK, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be precisely determined.Concerning the mechanisms whereby G protein-coupled receptors are activated by their agonist ligands, the ternary complex model and the analysis of constitutively active G protein-coupled receptors led us to consider that receptors spontaneously interchange between several conformations and that the agonist exerts its biological effect either by selecting or by stabilizing and inducing (or both) an active conformation (40Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In other words, binding of the agonist allows for a reduction in the energy barrier for a transition from an inactive to an active state of the receptor. In order to better understand the mechanisms that govern CCK-AR activation, additional studies, including those that will identify residues that interact with the aromatic ring of the C-terminal Phe and the Trp of CCK are necessary. However, in the course of our work regarding mapping of CCK-AR agonist binding site, we have found that several residues of CCK, such as the sulfated tyrosine, that are crucial for high affinity binding and biological activity, are much less important for binding to low and very low affinity states of CCK-AR (24Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Silvente-Poirot S. Maigret B. Gouilleux L. Fehrentz J.A. Gully D. Moroder L. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14380-14386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The results were interpreted as an indication that these residues of CCK contribute to stabilization of the high affinity state of the receptor-ligand complex. Our previous study, which analyzed the pharmacological and the functional properties of the (M195L)-CCK-AR mutant, extended this conclusion to amino acids of the receptor that interact with these crucial residues of CCK (24Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Silvente-Poirot S. Maigret B. Gouilleux L. Fehrentz J.A. Gully D. Moroder L. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14380-14386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Results from the current study, showing that the (R336D)-CCK-AR·(Arg-8)-CCK complex had an affinity identical to that resulting from binding of CCK to the very low affinity state of (WT)-CCK-AR but remained inactive, confirm that correct positioning of pairing amino acids at the binding site is a prerequisite for occurrence of an active CCK-AR·CCK complex. These results illustrate how two-dimensional mutagenesis applied to putative peptide binding site of G protein-coupled receptors is a difficult task in term of gaining function.Direct interactions of peptide ligands with their receptors have only been reported in a limited number of cases. Recently, in the secretin receptor, interactions between two basic residues and secretin-Asp-3 were characterized using a strategy of two-dimensional site-directed mutagenesis (41Di Paolo E. De Neef P. Moguilevsky N. Petry H. Bollen A. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the AT1 angiotensin-II receptor, two extracellular residues, His-183 of the second extracellular loop and Asp-281 of the third extracellular loop were shown to interact with the N-terminal residues Asp-1 and Arg-2 of angiotensin-II (42Feng Y.H. Noda K. Saad Y. Liu X.P. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12846-12850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, amino acids of the receptor that interact with residues of the C-terminal half of angiotensin-II, which is essential for binding and biological activity, were identified within transmembrane domains III, V, and VI (43Noda K. Saad Y. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28511-28514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the NK-1 neurokinin receptor, several extracellular residues in addition to residues from the upper part of transmembrane domains were shown to directly interact with the natural ligand, Substance P (44Fong T.M. Yu H. Huang R.R. Strader C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11806-11811Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 45Fong T.M. Yu H. Strader C.D. Biophys.

Interestingly, binding sites for nonpeptide antagonists on these two receptors were localized in a pocket within transmembrane domains and appear therefore to be composed almost exclusively of amino acids distinct from those of the binding site for peptide agonists (20Schwartz T.W. Rosenkilde M.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 213-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,47Gether U. Nilsson L. Lowe III, J.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol.

Such findings imply that in these receptors, nonpeptide antagonists exclude the binding of agonist by allosteric regulation of the receptor conformation (20Schwartz T.W. Rosenkilde M.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 213-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). With respect to this point, our data on CCK-AR showing that Asn-333 and to a lesser extent Arg-336 are likely to be directly involved in the binding of nonpeptide antagonists SR-27897 and L-364,718, as well as in that of CCK, are original and indicate that no simple generalization can be made as to where ligands bind to G protein-coupled receptors.In conclusion, the amino acids identified in this study (Arg-336 and Asn-333) together with those from previous studies (Trp-39, Gln-40, Met-195, and Arg-197) (23Kennedy K.

Electrostatic interactions are therefore likely to represent the critical driving force for CCK binding to the high affinity active state of CCK-AR. Our data will be used to obtain an integrated dynamic view of the molecular processes that link agonist binding to receptor activation.

PLC activation results in hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), a cell membrane phospholipid, generating inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which releases calcium from intracellular stores, and diacylglycerol (DG), which activates protein kinase C.

However, it is not clear whether PLC-γ1 plays an essential role in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation by calcium. To address this issue, we blocked PLC-γ1 production with antisense PLC-γ1 cDNA and inhibited its activity with a specific PLC inhibitor. Our results indicate that PLC-γ1 signaling is required for calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation. Normal human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal human foreskins and grown in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM, Clonetics, San Diego, CA) as described previously (18Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Hincenbergs M. Elias P.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, keratinocytes were isolated from newborn human foreskins by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin, 4 °C, overnight), and primary cultures were established in KGM containing 0.07 mmcalcium. First and second passage keratinocytes were plated with KGM containing 0.03 mm calcium and used in the experiments described. The antisense PLC−γ1 constructs were made by inserting 4.2-kb human PLC-γ1 cDNA fragments containing the ATG start codon in an antisense orientation into the BamHI sites of a pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) which expresses a neomycin (G418) resistance gene. The 3.7-kb fragment of the human involucrin promoter (gift from Dr. Lorne B. Taichman) and the 2.2-kb fragment of the human transglutaminase promoter (gift from Dr. Robert Rice) were subcloned into a pGL-3-basic vector (Promega) (19Carroll J.M. Albers K.M. Garlick J.A.

Correct orientation of the inserts with respect to the luciferase sequence was verified by restriction enzyme analysis. First passage keratinocytes were transfected in suspension with the antisense PLC-γ1 (A) or pcDNA3.1(+) vector (V) using a Polybrene/glycerol method (21Jiang C.-K. Connolly D. Blumenberg M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 969-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated in KGM with 0.03 mm calcium. The transfected cells were selected by a 4-day incubation in 300 μm G418 starting 2 days after transfection. 1.2 mm calcium was added to the medium 2 days after selection, and cells were harvested 2 days later. The cellular protein was isolated, and the protein levels for PLC-γ1, PLC-β1, PLC-δ1, involucrin, and transglutaminase were quantitated by Western analysis. The cellular RNA was isolated, and the mRNA levels for involucrin and transglutaminase were quantitated by Northern analysis. In other experiments, second passage keratinocytes plated in 60-mm culture dishes were co-transfected with antisense PLC-γ1 (A) or pcDNA3.1(+) vector (V), involucrin, or transglutaminase-luciferase chimeric plasmid promoter constructs and with 0.2 μg of pRSVβ-gal (22Carroll J.M. Taichman L.B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 925-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a Polybrene method (20Mariniello L. Qin Q. Jessen B.A. Rice R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31358-31363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). pRSVβ-gal is a β-galactosidase expression vector that contains a β-galactosidase gene that is driven by a Rous Sarcoma Virus promoter and enhancer, which was used as an internal control to normalize for transfection efficiency. Calcium chloride was added to the cells 24 h after transfection at a final concentration of 1.2 mm. The cells were lysed 24 h later, and the cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and β-galactosidase activity using the Galacto-LightTM kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). A pGL-3-control vector (Promega) containing an SV40 promoter and SV40 enhancer, shown to be unresponsive to calcium, was included in each transfection experiment as a control. Every experiment was done in triplicate and was repeated at least three times. Total RNA was isolated from the keratinocytes using the STAT-60 kitTM (Tel-Test “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX), according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The isolated RNA (30 μg per lane) was electrophoresed through a 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using PosiBlot 30–30 Pressure Blotter (Stratagene), and immobilized by baking the membrane at 80 °C for 2 h. The human PLC-γ1 cDNA probe (gift from Dr. John Imboden) was labeled with 32P-dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by Random Prime-IT, II labeling kit (Stratagene), and purified by NucTrap Probe Purification Columns (Stratagene). The membrane was prehybridized and hybridized in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA with the32P-labeled human PLC-γ1 cDNA. Following hybridization at 65 °C overnight, the membrane was washed in solutions with decreasing ionic strength and increasing temperature to a final stringency of 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 65 °C. The32P-cDNA-mRNA hybrids were visualized by exposing to x-ray film and quantitated by densitometry using the program NIH Image. The human PLC-γ1 mRNA was normalized to the levels of 18 S ribosomal RNA in the same RNA blots as determined by rehybridization of the filter with a 32P-end-labeled cDNA for 18 S RNA. Keratinocytes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) for 5 min. Cells were scraped into microfuge tubes, incubated on ice for 15 min, and pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was collected. The protein concentration of the lysate was measured by the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were then electrophoresed through 7.5% polyacrylamide gels at 200 V for 30 min and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membranes (Immobilon-P, 0.45 μm, Millipore) in an electroblotting buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 5% methanol) at 130 V for 2 h. Following incubation in blocking buffer (100 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 5% non-fat milk, and 0.5% Tween 20), the blot was incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Involucrin protein was detected with a polyclonal mouse anti-human involucrin antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:2000 in blocking buffer. Transglutaminase protein was detected with a monoclonal mouse anti-human transglutaminase antibody (gift from Dr. Robert Rice) at a dilution of 1:200 in the blocking buffer. PLC-β1, -γ1, and -δ1 were detected with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human PLC-γ1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:200, a polyclonal rabbit anti-human PLC-β1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:200, and a polyclonal goat anti-human PLC-δ1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:200, respectively. After washes in the blocking buffer, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate anti-IgG secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:5000 in the blocking buffer. Following a second series of washes, bound antibody complexes were visualized using the SuperSignal ULTRA Chemiluminescent Kit (Pierce) and subsequent exposure to x-ray film. The specific bands on the autoradiograms were quantitated by densitometry. Calcium levels of keratinocytes attached to glass coverslips were measured using a Dual-wavelength Fluorescence Imaging System (Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Briefly, the cells were loaded with 1 μm Fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 0.1% Pluronic F127 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in buffer A (20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 120 mmsodium chloride, 5 mm potassium chloride, 0.5 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mg/ml pyruvate, 1 mm/ml glucose, and 0.03 mm calcium chloride) at room temperature for 30 min followed by a 30-min rinse in buffer A. The cells were then alternately illuminated with 200-ms flashes of 340 and 380 nm light every 10 s, monitoring the emission wavelength of 510 nm. Intracellular calcium concentration was calculated based on the ratio of emission at the two excitation wavelengths based on the formula developed by Grynkiewicz et al. (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To examine the role played by PLC-γ1 in keratinocyte differentiation, we examined the ability of the antisense PLC-γ1 construct to block calcium induction of the differentiation markers involucrin and transglutaminase. Keratinocytes were transfected with the full-length cDNA for PLC-γ1 in the antisense orientation to suppress PLC-γ1 expression. The transfectants were selected with a neomycin analogue G418 dissolved in KGM containing 0.03 mmcalcium for 4 days to enrich transfected cells. The cells were cultured in 0.03 mm calcium for 5 days and then in 1.2 mm calcium for an additional 2 days. The results showed that 1.2 mm calcium increased the levels of involucrin and transglutaminase in cells transfected with the vector. However, the stimulation of the involucrin and transglutaminase protein by calcium was markedly reduced by the antisense PLC-γ1 cDNA construct (Fig.1 a). The calcium-induced increase in involucrin and transglutaminase mRNA was also inhibited by antisense PLC-γ1 cDNA (Fig. 1 b). Basal involucrin and transglutaminase mRNA and protein levels at 0.03 mmcalcium were not affected by antisense PLC-γ1 cDNA constructs (Fig. 1, a and b). The specificity of the antisense construct for PLC-γ1 was assayed by Western analysis using PLC-γ1, -γ2, -β1, and -δ1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 a, calcium increased the protein levels of PLC-γ1, -β1, and -δ1. PLC-γ2 was not detected at either calcium concentration (data not shown). However, the PLC-γ1 protein level in the human keratinocytes transfected by antisense PLC-γ1 construct in the presence of 0.03 or 1.2 mm calcium was reduced dramatically compared with that in the human keratinocytes transfected by the vector alone. In contrast, the PLC-β1 and -δ1 protein levels were not reduced by the antisense PLC-γ1 construct (Fig.1 a). These data demonstrate that PLC-γ1 in keratinocytes is specifically suppressed by transfecting cells with the antisense PLC-γ1 cDNA. To determine whether PLC-γ1 is required for calcium transcription of involucrin and transglutaminase, involucrin or transglutaminase promoter constructs were cotransfected with the antisense PLC-γ1 construct and their response to calcium was evaluated. Both involucrin (Fig. 1 c) and transglutaminase (Fig. 1 d) promoter activities were inhibited by the antisense PLC-γ1 construct in the presence of 1.2 mm calcium. The promoter activities in the presence of 0.03 mm calcium were much lower than those in the presence of 1.2 mm calcium and were not affected by the antisense PLC-γ1 cDNA construct (Fig. 1, c andd). These data indicate that the induction of both involucrin and transglutaminase transcription by calcium requires PLC-γ1. To confirm the results obtained with the antisense PLC-γ1 construct, we examined the effect of the PLC-γ1 inhibitor 1-[6-[[17 β-3-metoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-py-rrole-2,5-dione (U73122) and its inactive analog U73343 on calcium-induced involucrin and transglutaminase protein and mRNA levels (Fig.2, a and b) and promoter activity (Fig. 2, c and d). In the presence of 0.03 mm calcium, the involucrin and transglutaminase mRNA and protein levels were much lower than those in the presence of 1.2 mm calcium and were not affected by either compound. U73122, however, blocked the calcium-induced increase in involucrin and transglutaminase mRNA and protein (Fig. 2,a and b). A closely related analog, U73343, which does not block PLC activity, had little or no effect on calcium-induced involucrin and transglutaminase mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 2 a and b). Similarly, the calcium-stimulated activities of the involucrin and transglutaminase promoter constructs were blocked by the active PLC inhibitor U73122 but not by the inactive analog U73343 (Fig. 2, c and d). Thus, the data from the PLC inhibitor experiments confirm those from the antisense cDNA transfection experiments in demonstrating the requirement for PLC-γ1 in calcium-induced involucrin and transglutaminase expression. To investigate the mechanism by which PLC-γ1 mediates calcium-induced differentiation, we examined the role of PLC-γ1 in the response of intracellular calcium to changes in extracellular calcium. The antisense PLC-γ1 cDNA construct was transfected into keratinocytes, and calcium levels were measured 48 h after the addition of 1.2 mm calcium. Keratinocytes transfected with vector alone showed a rise in calcium from 40 to 220 nm(Fig. 3). Cells transfected with the PLC-γ1 antisense construct had an equivalent base-line calcium at 0.03 mm calcium as the vector transfected cells but failed to increase their calcium in response to 1.2 mm calcium (Fig. 3). Thus, PLC-γ1 appears to regulate this very early response of the keratinocytes to calcium. The aim of this work was to study the role of PLC-γ1 in mediating the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation by calcium. Antisense cDNA methodology is useful in the analysis of specific gene functions. The antisense transcript has a sequence complementary to the target mRNA and anneals with the mRNA to disrupt normal processing or translation (24Izant J.D. Weintraub H. Science. 1985; 229: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In this study, the antisense PLC-γ1 cDNA was used to selectively inhibit the expression of PLC-γ1 in normal human keratinocytes treated by calcium to determine whether PLC-γ1 is involved in calcium-induced human keratinocyte differentiation. The 4.2-kb antisense PLC-γ1 mRNA specifically blocked PLC-γ1 expression without affecting PLC-β1 and -δ1 expression, the other major PLC isozymes in human keratinocytes. Involucrin and transglutaminase, a substrate and enzyme required for cornified envelope formation (25Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H.

Chem. 1988; 263: 5390-5395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blockage of PLC-γ1 production results in inhibition of calcium-induced involucrin and transglutaminase expression, indicating that PLC-γ1 is required for keratinocyte differentiation. To confirm these results, we used inhibitor of PLC. The compound U73122 is capable of inhibiting several PLC-dependent processes (29Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bala G.A. Thakur N.R. Bleasdale J.E. Biol.

It has been suggested that this compound inhibits PLC activity by binding to a calcium-binding site on the PLC which must be occupied by calcium for PLC activity to occur. We used this agent to block PLC activity in keratinocytes as a second means of testing the role of PLC in calcium stimulation of keratinocyte differentiation. In agreement with the results obtained from the antisense transfection experiments, calcium-induced involucrin and transglutaminase expression was blocked by the PLC inhibitor. Thus, PLC is required for calcium-induced differentiation. Several mechanisms for this effect need to be considered. In murine keratinocytes, calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation is associated with enhanced PLC-γ1 protein expression but not increased mRNA level (14Punnonen K. Denning M. Lee E. Li L. Rhee S.G. Yuspa S.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 719-726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Punnonen K. Denning M.F. Rhee S.G. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Carcinogen. 1994; 10: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our current data show that in human keratinocytes, both PLC-γ1 protein and mRNA levels are induced by calcium. The shift to differentiation associated with increasing the calcium level of the medium from 0.03 to 1.2 mm is quite rapid. Within hours of the calcium switch, morphological changes related to differentiation described previously (25Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar) are apparent under phase-contrast microscope in the cells transfected with vector and the cells treated with vehicle or the inactive analogue of the PLC inhibitor. The cells transfected with antisense PLC-γ1 construct or treated with the PLC inhibitor did not show the morphological changes. These data are consistent with the observations of the decreased expression of the two differentiation markers involucrin and transglutaminase in the cells transfected with antisense PLC-γ1 construct and the cells treated with PLC inhibitor. PLC-γ1 hydrolyzes PIP2 into two second messengers, IP3 and DG, which are likely to play important roles in the differentiation process. DG production increases PKC activity which activates AP1 factors. Microinjection of PLC-γ1 antibody into fibroblasts was reported to block platelet-derived growth factor induction of c-fos, a transcriptional factor binding to AP1 sites (32Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has identified the calcium-responsive element in the involucrin gene and shown that it contains an AP1 site that is critical for its function (33Ng D.C. Su M.-J. Kim R. Bikle D.D. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: a16-a24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory has also shown that transglutaminase promoter constructs containing AP1 sites (34Lu S. Saydak M. Gentile V. Stein J.P. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9748-9756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) when transfected into human keratinocytes were responsive to calcium although we have not yet precisely localized the calcium-responsive element. 2D. C. Ng and D. D. Bikle, unpublished data. IP3, on the other hand, increases the release of calcium from intracellular stores which can also stimulate PKC activity. Previous studies have shown that calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation requires an increase in intracellular calcium (35Jaken S. Yuspa S.H. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36Lee E. Yuspa S.H. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 37Kruszewski F.H.

Our study determined that PLC-γ1 is required for the increase in intracellular calcium mobilization following the calcium switch. Thus, calcium requires PLC-γ1 to induce differentiation in keratinocytes, perhaps because of the ability of PLC-γ1 to generate the second messengers, IP3, DG, and calcium, which trigger the differentiation response."

Treatment of macrophages with vanadate results in the activation of both NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The activity of a recently identified cellular kinase, IκB kinase-β (IKKβ), was significantly elevated concomitant with the increased degradation of IκBα and enhanced NF-κB activity in cells exposed to vanadate. To determine whether the IKK pathway and JNK pathway are interconnected or bifurcate upon vanadate stimulation, cells were transfected with either a kinase inactive form of IKKβ or a kinase inactive form of SAPK/ERK kinase 1 (SEK1). Inactive IKKβ was able to block vanadate-induced degradation of IκBα, yet it was unable to influence the activation of JNK by vanadate. Conversely, blockage of JNK activation by transfection of a kinase-inactive form of SEK1 resulted in partially inhibition of vanadate-induced IκBα degradation. Both vanadate-induced degradation of IκBα and activation of JNK were potently inhibited by pretreatment of cells withN-acetylcysteine or dimercaprol. These results demonstrate that early activation of stress kinases or change of cellular redox states plays a key role in vanadate-induced activation of NF-κB and JNK.

Yet our understanding about biological mechanisms and the initiation and progression of disease as a result of exposure to PM is still primitive and fragmentary. The genetic program that mediates cellular reaction following the inhalation of environmental or occupational airborne PM involves the transient expression of select transcription units, including those that encode interleukin-1, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and several cell adhesion molecules (5Dong W. Lewtas J. Luster M.I. Exp. Lung Res. 1996; 22: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that this process is initiated through a pre-existed genetic switch, NF-κB transcription factor, that stimulates the κB-enhancer sequences present in the promoters of genes involved in the inflammatory response and the control of cell death or transformation (6Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4284) Google Scholar, 7Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by a group of inhibitory proteins including IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε. In response to extracellular stimuli, IκB is phosphorylated and proteolytically degraded, resulting in the release of active NF-κB that translocates to the nucleus. Both IκB kinase (IKK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase may be actively involved in signal-induced phosphorylation of IκB and subsequent activation of NF-κB (8Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The question, however, that still remains is whether these two kinase pathways act independently or have a mutual dependence on each other. It is also an important issue to resolve whether certain NF-κB-inducers use one of the two pathways preferentially. It is known that both NF-κB-inducing kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) can directly phosphorylate and activate IKKα and IKKβ, two components of the IKK complex. However, co-expression studies demonstrate that NK-κB-inducing kinase can phosphorylate IKKα at Ser176, but weakly phosphorylates IKKβ, whereas MEKK1 is apparently more potent in the phosphorylation of IKKβ (8Karin M.

It has been hypothesized that metal ions may contribute to the pathological effects of inhaled PM. In this report, we characterized signaling pathways of NF-κB transcription factor, a pivotal regulator of inflammatory and carcinogenic responses, activated by vanadate, a vanadium ion with +5 oxidation state abundant in PM from combustion of fossil fuels and other air pollutants. We demonstrated that both IKK and SAPK/ERK kinase 1 (SEK1), an intermediate kinase within the MEKK1 to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, are involved in vanadate-induced NF-κB activation.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar), respectively. An expression vector for wild type IκBα (pCMV-IκBα) was described previously (14Good L.F. Maggirwar S.B. Kealiher A. Uhlik M. Sun S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To generate an expression vector for IκBα that is resistant to phosphorylation and degradation, wild type expression vector, pCMV-IκBα, was subjected to site-directed mutation using a QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), resulting in the mutation of S32A and S36A (S32A/S36A). Macrophages were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates at 5 × 105 cells/well for 2 days. The cells were transfected with indicated expression vectors using the DEAE-dextran method (15Chen F. Lu Y. Kuhn D.C. Maki M. Shi X. Sun S.-C. Demers L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The total amount of plasmid DNA was made constant by adding respective amounts of empty vector plasmids to transfection mixtures. Cells in each well were incubated with 1 ml of transfection mixtures for 2 h in serum-free medium. Twenty to 40 h after transfection, cells were subjected to the respective treatment as indicated under “Results.” Luciferase activity was determined and normalized relative to the β-galactosidase activity. IKK activity assay was performed by the methods of Geleziunas et al. (16Geleziunas R. Ferrell S. Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T. Grant M. Connelly M.A. Hambor J.E. Marcu K.B. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5157-5165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, macrophages, transfected with pCR-IKKβ, were treated with vanadate and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml). After centrifugation of the lysate at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated with anti-IKKβ antibody H-470 with rotation for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of Protein A-Agarose and incubation at 4 °C for additional 2 h. The immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g and washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer containing 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For kinase reaction, the immunoprecipitate was incubated in 20 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of GST-IκBα(FL) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) which was then dried and subjected to autoradiography. The activity of JNK was determined using a SAPK/JNK assay kit following the procedures provided by manufacturer. Whole cell extracts were mixed with 3 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% gels. The resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed as described previously (15Chen F. Lu Y. Kuhn D.C. Maki M. Shi X. Sun S.-C. Demers L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using antibodies against IκBα, IKKβ, Flag, phosphotyrosine, and anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates. For stabilizing and detecting the slightly slower mobility of the phosphorylated IκBα, macrophages were pretreated with 40 μm lactacystin for 2 h and subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 12-cm long minigel instead of the 7-cm long minigels used normally. The specific protein bands were visualized through enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Recent studies have demonstrated that a multisubunit IKK complex, containing two interactive catalytic components, termed IKKα and IKKβ, that mediate specific phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36, is required for the activation of NF-κB in response to stimulation by HTLV-1 Tax protein and cytokines (16Geleziunas R. Ferrell S. Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T. Grant M. Connelly M.A. Hambor J.E. Marcu K.B. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5157-5165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M.

Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). In this regard, we reasoned that the induction of NF-κB by vanadate (Fig. 1 A) might also be through the activation of IKK. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of vanadate on IKKβ activity by analysis of intracellular kinase activity and in vitro kinase reaction. We chose to examine the IKKβ activity in cells transfected with an expression vector encoding wild type IKKβ because of a failure to detect the phosphorylation of IκBα and the endogenous IKK activity in non-transfected cells. When cells were pretreated with lactacystin, a relatively specific inhibitor for proteasome (20Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar), to block the rapid degradation of phosphorylated endogenous IκBα protein, an upshifted phosphorylated IκBα band could be easily detected in the cells treated with vanadate (Fig. 1 B, lane 2, upper panel). Incubation of this cellular extract with 15 to 30 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase resulted in the disappearance of this slowly migrating IκBα band (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4, upper panel). This phosphorylated IκBα band could not be induced by vanadate in cells transfected with a kinase inactive IKKβ, IKKβ-KM (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6–10, upper panel). Thelower panel in Fig. 1 B shows the equal expression of exogenous IKKβ (lanes 1–5) or IKKβ-KM (lanes 6–10). Since it is possible that vanadate can induce other cellular kinases to phosphorylate IκBα, it is important to determine whether the vanadate-induced kinase activity is specific for the phosphorylation of Ser32/Ser36 on the IκBα molecule. Thus, IKKβ-transfected macrophages were co-transfected with an expression vector for a wild type IκBα or its mutated form in which Ser32 and Ser36 were substituted with alanines. Theupper panel in Fig. 1 C demonstrated that IKKβ was able to induce phosphorylation (lane 2) and degradation (lane 3) of wild type IκBα in cells treated with vanadate for 15–30 min. However, no phosphorylation and degradation of S32A/S36A mutated IκBα was observed (Fig. 1 C, lanes 6–10). By the use of a rabbit polyclonal antibody that could immunoprecipitate IKKβ from the cells treated with vanadate and the use of a GST-IκBα fusion protein which served as a substrate, the IKKβ activity was observed by an in vitro kinase activity assay. As shown in Fig. 1 D, IKKβ activity was significantly elevated in the immunoprecipitates from cells treated with increasing concentrations of vanadate (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1–5, upper panel). Lanes 6–10 indicated a time course induction of IKKβ kinase activity in cells treated with 30 μm vanadate. Since above studies clearly demonstrated that vanadate induction of NF-κB was through the activation of IKKβ kinase activity, the effects of a kinase inactive form of IKKβ (IKKβ-KM) on vanadate-induced NF-κB activation was evaluated. While co-transfection of macrophages (5 × 105 cells) with wild type IKKβ (0 to 4 μg) and a 2 × NF-κB luciferase reporter (0.5 μg) resulted in a marginal increase of vanadate-induced luciferase activity, co-transfection of macrophages with increasing concentrations of IKKβ-KM inhibited vanadate-induced reporter gene activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). The inhibition of IKKβ-KM on vanadate-induced NF-κB activation was further verified by Western blot analysis for vanadate-induced degradation of IκBα, an intracellular inhibitor for NF-κB transcription factor (Fig.2 B). IκBα degradation was induced by vanadate treatment for 20 min (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). A peak degradation of IκBα induced by vanadate was at 40 min (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). After 80 min treatment of macrophages with vanadate, resynthesized IκBα was observed (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). IKKβ-KM (lanes 11–15), but not empty vector (lanes 1–5) or wild type IKKβ (lanes 6–10), potently inhibited IκBα degradation induced by vanadate. Transfection of cells with a wild type IKKβ resulted in a more rapid degradation of IκBα induced by vanadate (Fig. 2 B, comparing lanes 6–10 withlanes 1–5). Emerging evidence suggested that JNK was activated by a spectrum of stimuli similar to those that cause NF-κB activation, and that MEKK1, an upstream kinase for JNK, was capable of regulating IKK activity and NF-κB activation (8Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 10Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We next examined whether vanadate was also able to induce the activation of JNK. Lysates of untreated and vanadate-treated cells were assayed for kinase activity with N-terminal c-Jun-GST fusion protein as substrate for JNK. While marginal basal JNK activity was detected in non-stimulated cells, elevated JNK activation was observed in a dose-dependent manner in cells treated with increasing concentrations of vanadate (Fig. 3 A). Time course studies indicated that the activation of NF-κB by vanadate was transient with a maximum activation at 1 h by a gel shift assay (Fig.3 B). To examine whether similar kinetics existed in the induction of JNK by vanadate, a time course study was performed. Note that within 30 min after treatment of cells with vanadate, the cells began to exhibit elevated JNK activity. The maximum induction of JNK activity occurred after a 2–4 h treatment of cells with vanadate. A small decrease in the levels of JNK activation was then observed at 8 h of exposure and was followed by a further drop at 10 h of stimulation (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). These results suggest that the induction of JNK by vanadate is more persistent than that vanadate induction of NF-κB (Fig. 3 C). The pathological effects triggered by vanadium ions are thought to be due to its capacity to change the intracellular redox states. Within tissue, vanadate is reduced to vanadyl by intracellular reducing agents such as glutathione (25Bode H.P. Friebel C. Fuhrmann G.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1022: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that will result in the depletion of GSH. On the other hand, electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) spin trapping revealed that an one-electron reduction of vanadate occurs in the presence of NAD(P)H with the reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, which subsequently reacts with vanadyl to generate hydroxyl free radicals and cause lipid peroxidation (26Shi X. Dalal N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine whether the induction of JNK and NF-κB by vanadate involves the alteration of GSH levels, cells were treated with 20 mm NAC for 2 h prior to exposure to 30 μm vanadate. As indicated in Fig.4, pretreatment with NAC inhibited the activation of JNK (top panel) and degradation of IκBα protein (middle panel) induced by vanadate (Fig. 4,lanes 5 and 6). Similarly, addition of 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (British Anti-Lewisite, BAL) to protect the intracellular –SH groups abolished the induction of JNK and degradation of IκBα by vanadate (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and8). By themselves, both NAC and BAL had no effect on the activation of JNK and NF-κB (data not shown). The expression of JNK protein was not affected by these treatments (Fig. 4, bottom panel). Thus, the alteration of the intracellular level of thiols, has a potent effect on the induction of JNK and NF-κB by vanadate. It has been recognized that certain kinds of vanadium compounds, including perxovanadium and sodium oxodiperoxovanadate, are protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors and are able to activate Syk kinase and Src family kinases through increasing tyrosine phosphorylation (27Krejsa C.M.

The involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα has also been demonstrated in oxidation- and pervanadate-induced NF-κB activation (29Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In this context, we next investigated whether a similar mechanism was occurring in the activation of IKK by vanadate. Vanadate treatment of cells transfected with an expression vector for wild type IKKβ resulted in an accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated total cellular protein (Fig.5 A). However, an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 blot of immunoprecipitated IKKβ revealed no appreciable change of phosphotyrosine levels on IKKβ throughout the time course (Fig. 5 B, upper panel). In addition, we were unable to detect a change in tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα protein (data not shown). Well established evidence has suggested that the activation of NF-κB and JNK are through separate signaling pathways in response to TNFα and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (8Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30Lin Z.-g. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

Nevertheless, both pathways may utilize certain common signaling molecules (21Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 23Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B.

Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) as summarized in Fig.6 A. To determine whether inhibition of vanadate-induced NF-κB signaling pathways could interfere with the JNK pathway, cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, transfected with a kinase inactive form IKKβ (IKKβ-KM) or a degradation resistant IκBα(S32A/S36A). As shown in Fig. 6 B, treatment of cells with lactacystin completely blocked the degradation of IκBα induced by vanadate (Fig. 6 B, upper panel). Lysates from identical cell cultures were also subjected to a JNK activity assay. Lactacystin was unable to inhibit vanadate-induced JNK activation. In contrast, treatment of cells with lactacystin resulted in an increase of vanadate-induced JNK activity (Fig. 6 B, lanes 6–10, lower panel). Since other cellular biological processes may also be affected by the proteasome inhibitor, we next used IKKβ-KM and degradation resistant IκBα (S32A/S36A) to block the NF-κB pathway specifically. In the cells transfected with IKKβ-KM, vanadate-induced degradation of IκBα was abolished as expected (Fig. 6 C, lanes 5–10, panel 1). However, no influence of IKKβ-KM on JNK activation was observed (Fig. 6 C, lanes 6–10, panel 3). It was also observed that degradation resistant IκBα (S32A/S36A) failed to affect the activation of JNK by vanadate (Fig. 6 C, lanes 11–15, panel 3). The equivalent experiment to measure the degradation of endogenous IκBα induced by vanadate in IκBα (S32A/S36A)-transfected cells was also performed. However, we could not detect endogenous IκBα degradation because of the presence of exogenous degradation resistant IκBα bands that obscure the bands of endogenous native IκBα. The involvement of MEKK1 in NF-κB signaling suggested that the JNK pathway may integrate into the activation pathway for NF-κB under certain circumstances. Therefore, we subsequently examined the effect of a kinase inactive form of SEK1, SEK1-KM, on vanadate-induced IKKβ activity and IκBα degradation. As shown in Fig. 7 A, treatment of cells with vanadate resulted in the elevation of IKKβ activity. While wild type SEK1 marginally enhanced vanadate-induced IKKβ activity, overexpression of SEK1-KM significantly decreased vanadate-induced activities of IKKβ (Fig. 7 A, lane 4, top panel). The expression of transfected exogenous IKKβ, SEK1, and SEK1-KM was shown in the middle and bottom panels, respectively. Transfection of cells with SEK1-KM resulted in a significant inhibition of JNK activation by vanadate (Fig.7 B, lanes 6–10, panel 3). Western blot analysis indicated that blocking the activation of JNK by transfection of SEK1-KM led to a partial inhibition of vanadate-induced IκBα degradation (Fig.7 B, lanes 6–10, panel 1). We also examined the effect of a kinase inactive form of JNK, JNK-KM, on the activation of NF-κB. Transient transfection JNK-KM reduced the JNK activation by vanadate (Fig. 7 B, lanes 11–15, panel 3). This transfection, however, had no effect on vanadate-induced IκBα degradation (Fig.7 B, lanes 11–15, panel 1). We provide evidence in the present study that vanadate, one of the most common forms of vanadium found in tissues or cells after exposure (33Cantley Jr., L.C. Aisen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1781-1784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zychlinski L. Byczkowski J.Z. Arch. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 1990; 19: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), is capable of inducing the activation of NF-κB and JNK. Transfection studies demonstrated that the activation of NF-κB by vanadate required IKKβ. Kinase activity assays suggested that vanadate was a potent activator of IKKβ kinase activity (Fig. 1,B-D). We did not determine the IKKα activity in vanadate-treated cells in the present study. It is possible that vanadate was able to activate IKKα as well, despite the fact that IKKβ appears to be much more potent and specific than IKKα for the signaling pathway leading to the activation of NF-κB (21Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 35Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our IKK kinase activity assay relies on immunoprecipitation of transfected IKKβ. IKKβ is in favor of forming a heterodimer with IKKαin vivo. It was also possible that some endogenous IKKα was pulled-down together with IKKβ and composed part of kinase activity in this kinase activity assay. Vanadate can also activate JNK as demonstrated in present study. It will be interesting, therefore, to examine the relationship between NF-κB and JNK pathways in vanadate-exposed cells. Inhibition of NF-κB activation by IKKβ-KM or degradation resistant IκBα (S32A/S36A) failed to influence the activation of JNK by vanadate suggesting that the JNK activation can be independent from NF-κB signaling (Fig. 6, B andC). In contrast, inhibition of JNK signaling pathway by a kinase inactive form of SEK1, SEK1-KM, but not JNK-KM, did exhibit a detectable inhibition of vanadate-induced IKKβ activity, IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation (Fig. 7). This result suggests that the involvement of JNK pathway in the activation of NF-κB occurred upstream or at the same level of SEK1. At present the detailed molecular mechanism by which SEK1 is involved in NF-κB signaling remains to be determined. Even though there are some similarities between NF-κB and JNK activation by a variety of extracellular stimuli, the signaling pathways for the activation of NF-κB and JNK are thought to be separate responses. Important evidence to support this is provided by the study of TNF type 1 receptor-mediated activation of NF-κB and JNK (30Lin Z.-g. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Over-expression of a catalytically inactive MEKK1 (K432M) to block JNK activation by TNF or TRAF2 did not prevent NF-κB activation. Likewise, overexpression of the phosphorylation-defective IκBα (S32A/S36A) mutant to block NF-κB activation had no effect on JNK activation. A similar observation was achieved in the study of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded latent membrane protein 1-induced activation of NF-κB and JNK (31Eliopoulos A.G. Young L.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a possible convergence may occur for both signaling axes under different circumstances (Fig.6 A). The first report to indicate this interconnection between NF-κB and JNK signaling is based on the observation that the activation of a purified IKK complex required MEKK1 (22Chen Z. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Blockage of MEKK1 was able to inhibit TNF- or HTLV-1 Tax-induced activation of NF-κB reporter gene (23Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13234-13238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The observation that a 70-kDa MEKK1 catalytic subunit is associated with the IKK complex provided plausible evidence to support this notion (19Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Our finding that vanadate activates both NF-κB and JNK, and the involvement of SEK1 in vanadate-induced NF-κB signaling further supports the possible connection between NF-κB and JNK pathways. It is noteworthy that some reports suggest that several vanadium compounds exert an inhibitory effect on protein tyrosine phosphatase and thereby increase the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation on total cellular proteins (27Krejsa C.M. Nadler S.G. Esselstyn J.M. Kavanagh T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11541-11549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Barbeau B. Bernier R.

Studies by Krejsa and his co-workers (27Krejsa C.M. Nadler S.G. Esselstyn J.M. Kavanagh T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. J. Biol.

Yet it is not clear whether tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in the activation of NF-κB and JNK by vanadate in the present study. First, we found the tyrosine phosphorylation level was very marginal early in the exposure of cells to vanadate (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2–4). Second, IκBα degradation or JNK activation induced by vanadate occurred within 10 to 30 min (Fig. 2 B and Fig.3 C) or earlier (data not shown). However, an appreciable increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of total cellular protein was achieved 80 min after cells were treated with vanadate. Finally, we could not identify any change of tyrosine phosphorylation on IKKβ (Fig. 5 B) or IκBα (data not shown). The discrepancy between our results and these of others may be simply due to the use of different forms of vanadium and different cell types. Indeed, early studies have shown that vanadate slightly inhibited or had no effect on many of the mammalian protein tyrosine phosphatases tested (37Lau K.H. Farley J.R. Baylink D.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 38Brunati A.M. Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, since exogenously added vanadate, after permeating into the cell interior, is efficiently reduced to vanadyl ion, it is possible that this form of vanadium exhibits an inhibitory effect on receptor tyrosine kinases (39Elberg G. Li J. Shechter Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9521-9527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How does vanadate activate cellular kinase cascades that lead to the activation of NF-κB and JNK? A simplified interpretation of our results is that this activation might be through the change of cellular redox states, since oxidant free radicals have been considered a common denominator involved in environmental insult-triggered diseases (40Becker S. Soukup J.M. Gilmour M.I. Devlin R.B. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To support this, treatment of cells with NAC to elevate intracellular thiol-containing molecules, such as GSH, abolished vanadate-induced JNK activation and IκBα degradation. It is known that many kinases or phosphatases contain redox-sensitive cysteines. Oxidation of these cysteines will result in the activation or inhibition of these kinases or phosphatases (41Ginn-Pease M.E. Whisler R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 346-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The exact role of free radicals in the regulation of kinase activity is being investigated in our as well as other laboratories. There is ample evidence that activation of JNK leading to the elevation of AP-1 activity is linked to the malignant transformation of cells (42van Dam H. Huguier S. Kooistra K. Baguet J. Vial E. van der Eb A.J. Herrlich P. Angel P. Castellazzi M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of IKK leading to the increased NF-κB activity is mainly associated with inflammation (6Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4284) Google Scholar, 7Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar, 8Karin M. Delhase M. Proc.

A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The situation will be worse if both JNK and IKK are activated at the same time. A certain degree of additive or synergistic effects may occur between these two signaling axes. This is true in the diseases related to vanadium exposure, in which both mutagenicity and inflammation induced by vanadate have been reported (11Kodavanti U.P. Hauser R. Christiani D.C. Meng Z.H.

Regarding environmental or occupational PM, in addition to vanadium, other metals and metal-metal interactions may also have some impact on overall PM-induced biological changes. A more detailed biological study is needed to determine the role of vanadium-baring PM from the cellular to molecular level in order to provide the mechanistic information necessary for risk assessment.

To identify the domain(s) of the Epo receptor (Epo-R) required for Epo-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant Epo receptors subcloned into pTracer-cytomegalovirus vector. This vector contains an SV40 early promoter, which drives expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, and a cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter driving expression of the Epo-R. Successful transfection was verified in single cells by detection of GFP, and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca]<sub>i</sub>) changes were simultaneously monitored with rhod-2. Transfection of CHO cells with pTracer encoding wild-type Epo-R, but not pTracer alone, resulted in an Epo-induced [Ca]<sub>i</sub> increase that was abolished in cells transfected with Epo-R F8 (all eight cytoplasmic tyrosines substituted). Transfection with carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants indicated that removal of the terminal four tyrosine phosphorylation sites, but not the tyrosine at position 479, abolished Epo-induced [Ca]<sub>i</sub> increase, suggesting that tyrosines at positions 443, 460, and/or 464 are important. In CHO cells transfected with mutant Epo-R in which phenylalanine was substituted for individual tyrosines, a significant increase in [Ca]<sub>i</sub> was observed with mutants Epo-R Y443F and Epo-R Y464F. The rise in [Ca]<sub>i</sub> was abolished in cells transfected with Epo-R Y460F. Results were confirmed with CHO cells transfected with plasmids expressing Epo-R mutants in which individual tyrosines were added back to Epo-R F8 and in stably transfected Ba/F3 cells. These results demonstrate a critical role for the Epo-R cytoplasmic tyrosine 460 in Epo-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx."

Directed searches for microbial secondary metabolites that inhibit bacterial growth led to the discovery of antibiotics and thus gave rise to the traditional interpretation that their only biological relevance is to inhibit growth of competing organisms. Nevertheless, antibiotics often have alternative molecular targets and, like other secondary metabolites, elicit numerous “unexpected” effects on microbial differentiation (1Demain A.L.

They were first discovered as antibiotics synthesized by diverse bacteria including Streptomyces,Bacillus, and Micrococcus. These compounds later proved to be effective growth promotants for domestic animals (2Keppas L. DeGrote F. Rev. Agric. Brussels. 1979; 32: 159Google Scholar, 3Mine K. Miyairi N. Takano N. Mori S.

Sci. 1980; 50: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), an effect whose biological basis is not clear. Thiostrepton, whose antibiotic activity is best understood, acts by binding tightly to the procaryotic ribosome and thus inhibiting translation (5Cundliffe E. Nature. 1987; 69: 863-869Google Scholar, 6Xing Y. Draper D.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Rosendahl F. Douthwaite S. J. Mol.

In a thiostrepton-producing organism, Streptomyces azureus, methylation of a specific nucleotide in the 23 S rRNA can provide resistance. Such methylated ribosomes do not bind and are therefore not sensitive to thiostrepton (9Cundliffe E. Chambliss G. Craven G.R. Davies J. Davis K. Kahan K. Nomura M. Antibiotics and Procaryotic Ribosomes: Action, Interaction, and Resistance in Ribosomes Structure, Function, Genetics. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1980: 555-581Google Scholar). The gene encoding this methylase (tsr) was originally cloned as an antibiotic resistance determinant (10Thompson C.J. Skinner R.H. Thompson J. Ward J.M. Haywood D.A. Cundliffe E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 678-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been incorporated into mostStreptomyces cloning vectors (11Smokvina T. Mazodier M. Boccard F. Thompson C.J. Guerineau M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 94: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Kuhstoss S. Rao R.N. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 103: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Bibb M.J. Ward J.M. Cohen S.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 199: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Routine use of thiostrepton to select for tsr-containing vectors in S. lividans revealed several unexpected biological activities. Thiostrepton made S. lividans more resistant to a variety of structurally heterogeneous antibiotics (Ref.14Holmes D.J. Caso J.L. Katoh T. Thompson C.J. Balz R.H. Hegeman G.D. Skatrud P.L. Industrial Microorganisms: Basic and Applied Molecular Genetics. ASM, Washington, D. C.1993: 69-73Google Scholar, and references therein) and caused accumulation ofthiostrepton-induced proteins (Tip). Two of these proteins, TipAL and TipAS, proved to be alternate in-frame translation products of the same gene (15Murakami T. Holt T.G. Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (tipA, Fig. 2). At its N terminus, TipAL contained a conserved helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif that defined it as a member of the MerR family of transcriptional activators. The non-homologous C-terminal domains of these genes interact with different low molecular weight compounds: MerR with mercuric ion (16Helmann J.D. Ballard B.T. Walsh C.T. Science. 1990; 247: 946-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Ansari A.Z. Chael M.L. O'Halloran T.V. Nature. 1992; 355: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), BmrR and BltR with rhodamine 6G and tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (18Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SoxR with an unknown compound (19Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reflecting superoxide anion toxicity (20Hidalgo E. Demple B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A structural basis for multidrug recognition has recently been revealed by the crystal structure of the binding domain of BmrR complexed with tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (21Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After binding the respective regulators, these proteins activate transcription of corresponding regulons that confer resistance to mercury (MerR), superoxide stress (SoxR), or diverse antibiotics and antiseptics (SoxR, BmrR, and BltR). The corresponding C-terminal region of TipAL, lacking the helix-turn-helix motif, is translated independently in vast molar excess as TipAS. Both TipAS and TipAL can covalently bind thiostrepton (22Holmes D.J. Caso J.L. Thompson C.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3183-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A reaction between a dehydroalanine residue in thiostrepton and one of two C-terminal cysteines (Fig. 2) creates an antibiotic-TipAL complex (23Chiu M.L. Folcher M. Griffin P. Holt T. Thompson C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that activates transcription of a monocistronic mRNA from the tipA promoter (ptipA) (22Holmes D.J. Caso J.L. Thompson C.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3183-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The ptipA has proven to be a valuable tool that has led to the discovery of new antibiotics. When actinomycete metabolite libraries, a traditional source of molecular diversity, were empirically screened for ptipA-inducing activities, 15 compounds were identified (24Yun B.S. Hidaka T. Furihata K. Seto H. J. Antibiot. 1994; 47: 1541-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Yun B.S. Seto H. Biosci. Biotechnol.

Furihata K. Seto H. J. Antibiot. 1994; 47: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). While they had quite different chemical structures, all were thiopeptides having antibiotic activity. Since the TipA proteins are found in Streptomyces strains not known to have the thiopeptide biosynthetic genes, it is unclear what metabolic signals are the natural inducers of tipA. Here we investigate the TipAL regulon and thiopeptide structural motifs that are important for TipA interactions.

Me2SO was purified by passing through dry alumina and dry silica columns. Promothiocins MO and MN were isolated from the methanolysate of promothiocin B. Dried amberlite 15 (1 g) was added to a solution of promothiocin B (90 mg) in 3 ml of methanol. This mixture was refluxed for 24 h under N2 and then dried under reduced pressure. The residue, dissolved in 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (5:1), was applied to preparative silica TLC plates and developed with chloroform/methanol (15:1). The two spots withRF values of 0.59 and 0.51 corresponded to promothiocin MO and MN, respectively. Both spots were scraped off the plates and then purified further by preparative HPLC (YMC-packed C18 column, 20 × 250 mm, with a flow rate of 18 ml/min). The HPLC column was run with a gradient of acetonitrile and water to yield the purified promothiocins (32 mg of MO eluted at 38% acetonitrile; 21 mg of MN eluted at 33% acetonitrile). Promothiocin MO was a white crystalline powder. The HRFAB-MS spectrum had a MH+ species with m/z of 762.2175, which corresponded to a molecular formula C34H35N9O8S2(theoretical 762.2128 Da). 1H NMR of promothiocin MO in CDCl3/CD3OD (9:1) had resonance peaks at 8.55 ppm (1H, d, J = 7.9 Hz), 8.20 ppm (1H, d,J = 8.2 Hz), 8.07 ppm (1H, s), 8.01 ppm (1H, s), 5.38 ppm (1H, q, J = 7.0 Hz), 5.30 ppm (1H, q,J = 7.0 Hz), 4.70 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.2 Hz), 4.35 ppm (1H, d, J = 6.4 Hz), 4.12 ppm (1H, d,J = 16.2 Hz), 4.00 ppm (3H, s), 2.53 ppm (3H, s), 2.51 ppm (3H, s), 2.22 ppm (1H, m), 1.62 ppm (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), 1.54 ppm (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), 1.54 ppm (3H, d,J = 7.0 Hz), and 1.01 ppm (6H, d, J = 6.7 Hz). Promothiocin MN was a white crystalline powder. The HRFAB-MS spectrum had a MH+ species with m/z of 747.2086, which corresponded to a molecular formula C33H34N10O7S2(theoretical 747.2132 Da). 1H NMR of promothiocin MN in CDCl3/CD3OD (9:1) had resonance peaks at 8.44 ppm (1H, d, J = 8.2 Hz), 8.21 ppm (1H, d,J = 8.2 Hz), 8.07 ppm (1H, s), 8.03 ppm (1H, s), 5.39 ppm (1H, q, J = 7.0 Hz), 5.34 ppm (1H, q,J = 7.0 Hz), 4.65 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.2 Hz), 4.37 ppm (1H, d, J = 6.1 Hz), 4.15 ppm (1H, d,J = 16.2 Hz), 2.52 ppm (3H, s), 2.39 ppm (3H, s), 2.24 ppm (1H, m), 1.62 ppm (3H, d, J = 6.7 Hz), 1.60 ppm (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz), 1.01 ppm (3H, d, J= 6.7 Hz), and 1.00 ppm (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz). Escherichia coliTG1 was used as a host for pUC19 and its derivatives. E. coli S17-1 was used as a donor strain for conjugation to S. lividans. pPS24 was the source of the viomycin resistance gene (28Mazodier P. Petter R. Thompson C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3583-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). TipA studies were done using SL carrying pAK114 (SL/pAK114) (15Murakami T. Holt T.G. Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. lividans spores produced on MS plates (1% agar containing 2% mannitol and 2% soybean meal) were filtered through cotton, and stored in 20% glycerol at −20 °C. Liquid cultures of SL/pIJ486 were grown in YEME medium (29Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, England1985Google Scholar). E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in Lysogeny broth using 100 mg/liter ampicillin or 50 mg/liter kanamycin for selection (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Nutrient agar was made from nutrient broth (plus 15 g/liter agar) obtained from Eiken Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan. Thiostrepton sensitivity disc assays were performed using S. lividans strains spread on NE agar (31Murakami T. Anzai H. Imai S. Satoh A. Nagaoka K. Thompson C.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 42-50Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Measured amounts of thiopeptide (in Me2SO) were applied on a paper disc, and the culture was incubated overnight at 30 °C. Alternatively, the minimal amount of antibiotic required to inhibit colony formation on NE agar was determined. The tipApromoter was cloned into pIJ486 in which a kanamycin resistance gene served as the reporter of promoter activity (15Murakami T. Holt T.G. Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid was used either in a disc (15Murakami T. Holt T.G. Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or plate assay. In the plate assay, SL/pAK114 spores were spread on nutrient agar supplemented with 10 μg/ml kanamycin and a series of 2-fold diluted thiopeptide compounds. The plate was scored for growth after 36-h of incubation at 30 °C. E. colicultures containing tipAL or tipAS expression vectors were grown to late exponential phase in a 25-liter fermentor at 30 °C. Expression of tipA genes was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min and stored at −20 °C. The cell paste was suspended in the lysis buffer containing 400 mg/liter lysozyme and 10 mg/liter deoxyribonuclease I and stirred gently overnight (this and all subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 30 min to yield a crude extract that was fractionated by adding solid ammonium sulfate to reach 45% w/v saturation and then centrifuged at 22,000 ×g for 15 min. Additional ammonium sulfate powder was added to this supernatant to reach 90% w/v saturation. The pellet was resuspended in three volumes of buffer (all subsequent steps were carried out in MA buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) and then dialyzed. After centrifugation, the dialysate was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column and eluted using a gradient of 0–0.2m NaCl. TipA-containing fractions were collected, dialyzed, applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted using a gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. TipA-containing fractions were collected, dialyzed, applied to a Source-Q column, and eluted in a gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. The fractions were collected and concentrated with an Amicon Ultrafiltration cell with a YM10 membrane. The concentrated solution was loaded on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted isocratically. The fractions containing the TipA protein were concentrated with Centricon 10 filters (Amicon). Before reaction with thiostrepton or other antibiotics, TipAS or TipAL (10 μg in 15 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) was reduced by the addition of sodium cyanoborohydride (2 μl of a freshly made 1 mm aqueous stock). After 5 min at room temperature, excess sodium cyanoborohydride was inactivated by adding 1 μl of acetone. Thiopeptides (10 μl of a 50 mg/liter purified Me2SO solution) were then added and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Protein products were desalted using a C4 HPLC column eluting with a gradient of 100% water to 75% acetonitrile/25% water. The proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE or digested with V8 protease in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, at 37 °C for 24 h and analyzed with ESI-MS. Mycelium was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and then washed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mg/liter benzamidine, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 20 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mmdithiothreitol) at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer, glass beads (0.1 mm diameter) were added to form a 30% v/v solution, and the tube was cooled on ice for 10 min. The mycelia in this slurry were sheared twice in a Bio-spec Products Minibead beater run at 3000 rpm for 1 min. The crude extract was centrifuged using a tabletop centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Samples of the crude extract were boiled for 3 min in a SDS-PAGE lysis buffer containing 20% w/v glycerol, 6% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue in 0.25 m Tris, pH 6.8. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) or Schägger and von Jagow (33Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (0.1% in 10% acetic acid), destained in 40% ethanol/10% acetic acid, and equilibrated in 10% ethanol/3% glycerol. After drying, radioactive spots were recorded on Fuji AIF-RX medical x-ray film. Two-dimensional gel analyses were carried out as described by Puglia et al. (34Puglia A.M. Vohradsky J. Thompson C.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The tipA gene was disrupted to determine whether it was required for thiopeptide-induced changes in gene expression. The hygromycin resistance gene (hyg) was first inserted into the 5′ region of the monocistronic tipA gene cloned in E. coli plasmid pAK315 (construction described in Fig. 3). pAK315 was then transferred from E. coli S17-1 to S. lividans by conjugation (28Mazodier P. Petter R. Thompson C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3583-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Since this plasmid cannot replicate in S. lividans, it could only be maintained by integration into the chromosome. Hygromycin-resistant and viomycin-sensitive (hygR/vioS) mutants would result from a double crossover event disrupting the tipA gene. Total DNAs from SL and such hygR/vioS tipAL disruption candidates were digested with SacI or KpnI and probed with the 1.2-kb pAK108 SacI fragment which included the site of hyg insertion (blots not shown). In the parental strain, this probe hybridized to the 1.2-kb SacI fragment or a 3.5-kb KpnI fragment. These fragments were not present in the tipA::hygR disruption strain (KT); instead, the probe hybridized to 1.1- and 1.5-kb SacI and 5.1-kbKpnI fragments corresponding in size to that predicted for the hyg-disrupted tipA locus. KT was compared with SL to determine whether disruption of tipA altered resistance to thiostrepton. An antibiotic disc sensitivity test revealed that about 5 times less thiostrepton was needed to obtain the same zones of inhibition on a KT lawn. This was further confirmed by streaking SL and KT out on the same medium containing increasing amounts of thiostrepton. Whereas the minimal inhibitory concentration for SL colony formation was 1 μg/ml, KT colony formation was inhibited by less than 0.2 μg/ml. The transcriptional activity of ptipA was monitored by cloning it into a Streptomyces promoter probe vector (pIJ486) so that it controlled a kanamycin resistance reporter gene (pAK114) (15Murakami T. Holt T.G. Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of ptipA could be visualized with a sensitive disc assay. Agar plates containing kanamycin were overlaid with spores of the indicator strain SL/114 or KT/114. When discs containing thiostrepton were applied to the surface of the plate, induction of ptipA was indicated by a zone of kanamycin-resistant growth whose diameter was dependent on both the amount of kanamycin in the plate and the amount of thiopeptide inducer in the disc (15Murakami T. Holt T.G. Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of inducers, no kanamycin-resistant growth was observed on plates containing greater than 5 mg/liter kanamycin. Whereas this very sensitive assay was able to detect less than 2 ng of thiostrepton using the SL/pAK114 indicator strain, 1 mg elicited no response in the tipA mutant KT/pAK114 (lacking the intact tipAL gene) or SL/pIJ486 (lackingptipA). These results showed that the reporter system had a strict requirement for both the ptipA and a functionaltipA gene. Exponentially growing (15 h) or stationary phase cultures (40 h) of SL/pIJ486 and KT/pIJ486 were induced with thiostrepton (2 mg/liter) and labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine. The changes in protein expression patterns that occur as a function of tipA and thiostrepton as visualized by SDS-PAGE were complex (Fig. 4). Although the thiostrepton response was noticeably different in exponential as compared with stationary phase cultures, this was not studied in detail. The exponential culture was more critically defined by automated analysis of two-dimensional PAGE patterns (gels not shown). Several thiostrepton-induced SDS-PAGE protein bands were observed in SL/pIJ486 (Fig. 4, compare exponential growth (lanes 1 and 2) or stationary phase (lanes 5 and 6)). Seventeen thiostrepton-induced two-dimensional PAGE protein spots were observed. Several of these bands, including TipAS, were not found in KT (compare exponential growth (lanes 2 and 4) or stationary phase (lanes 6 and 8)); these corresponded to eight two-dimensional PAGE protein spots. Finally, these analyses also revealed thiostrepton-repressed SDS-PAGE bands in both SL and KT; these corresponded to four two-dimensional PAGE spots in SL and two in KT. TipAL and TipAS proteins were produced using anE. coli expression system. AnNdeI/HindIII fragment of pNB2–5A1 containingtipAS was cloned into pDS8 (pMF101); anNdeI/HindIII fragment of pNB2-AL containingtipAL was cloned into pDS8 (pMF102) (22Holmes D.J. Caso J.L. Thompson C.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3183-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Campbell J.L. Richardson C.C. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mueller M. Ibrahimi I. Haeuptle M.-T. Dobberstein B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 416-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). E. coli strains containing these constructions were able to produce large amounts of TipA proteins in a soluble form. These proteins were purified (see “Experimental Procedures”) for in vitrostudies. Purified TipAS was mixed with thiostrepton, promothiocin A, promothiocin B, nosiheptide, or berninamycin (A and B) (Fig.1) and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (promothiocin B and thiostrepton are presented in Fig. 5 A). All of these compounds formed very stable complexes which could not be disrupted in 1% SDS/1% 2-mercaptoethanol (boiling), 8 murea, or 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. Their apparent molecular masses corresponded roughly to uncomplexed TipAS (∼17 kDa) or TipAS bound to one molecule of thiopeptide (∼18–19 kDa). ESI-MS experiments of TipAS or TipAL mixed with nosiheptide or promothiocin A confirmed that the TipA/thiopeptide stoichiometry was equimolar. 2T. Holt and P. Griffin, unpublished results. Previous studies using thiostrepton had shown these complexes were generated by a covalent reaction between a dehydroalanine residue in thiostrepton and one of the two cysteine residues in the TipA proteins (23Chiu M.L. Folcher M. Griffin P. Holt T. Thompson C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thiostrepton has one dehydroalanine residue in the ring and two in the tail (Fig. 1). In order to map the reactive dehydroalanine residues to the ring or tail, a tailless derivative of thiostrepton (thiostrepton B, Fig. 1) was tested. Thiostrepton (Fig. 5 A,lane 2) but not thiostrepton B (Fig.5 A, lane 4) altered the mobility of TipAS (Fig. 5 A, lane 7) on SDS-PAGE gels. To confirm the generality of this observation, tailless promothiocin derivatives MN (tail replaced by an amide group) and MO (tail replaced by an O-methyl group) were prepared from promothiocin B (Fig. 1) and purified to greater than 99.9% homogeneity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Promothiocin B was chosen as representative thiopeptide since it was composed of a simple ring structure having no dehydro amino acids and a tail containing three dehydroalanines (Fig. 1). TipA"

The strong homology found between the components of this archaeal transport system and the bacterial systems is evidence for the evolutionary conservation of the ABC transporters in these two phylogenetic branches. High affinity binding protein-dependent ABC transporters were originally discovered in Gram-negative bacteria. They consist of a binding protein as their major substrate recognition site, located in the periplasm, two hydrophobic membrane proteins forming the translocation pore, and, peripherally associated with them at the inner face of the membrane, two additional subunits. By ATP hydrolysis the latter provide the energy for the accumulation of substrate (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M.

In the case of the Escherichia coli maltose/maltodextrin transport system, malE is the gene for the periplasmic-binding protein (MBP or MalE), 1The abbreviations MBP (or MalE)periplasmic-binding proteinTMBPmaltose/trehalose-binding proteinATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) the membrane components are encoded by genes malF and malG, and the two ATP-hydrolyzing subunits, by malK. These genes form a cluster on the E. coli chromosome where malE malF malG constitute an operon that is oriented divergently tomalK (2Boos W. Shuman H.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding protein-dependent ABC transporters have also been found in thermophilic bacteria (3Sahm K. Matuschek M. Müller H. Mitchell W.J. Bahl H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Herrmann A. Schlösser A. Schmid R. Schneider E. Res. Microbiol. 1996; 147: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, we described an ABC transporter for maltose/trehalose in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus litoralis (5Xavier K.B. Martins L.O. Peist R. Kossmann M. Boos W. Santos H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4773-4777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This transport system has several unusual properties. It shows an extremely high affinity (K m of about 20 nm) at 85 °C, the optimum growth temperature of this organism, and it recognizes with equal affinity its very different substrates, maltose and trehalose, and is not inhibited by maltodextrins. The soluble high affinity maltose/trehalose-binding protein (TMBP) is anchored to the membrane by a lipid anchor.malE, the gene encoding TMBP, is the first gene in an operon with malF and malG as distal genes (6Horlacher R. Xavier K.B. Santos H. DiRuggiero J. Kossmann M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 680-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the molecular characterization of malK and the biochemical properties of the encoded purified His-tagged protein. periplasmic-binding protein maltose/trehalose-binding protein adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) Chromosomal DNA was prepared from T. litoralis by the method of Owen and Borman (7Owen R.J. Borman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 8: 3631Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because the trehalose/maltose system of T. litoralis is nearly identical to that of Pyrococcus furiosus, we searched the P. furiosus sequence data base at the Center of Marine Biotechnology, University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, for homology to the E. coli malK gene. The open reading frame with the highest homology was chosen for the synthesis of primers for amplification of the corresponding malK gene from T. litoralis. The two primers (5′-GCCATGGCTGGTGTTAGGCTTGTA-3′ and 5′-CTGGATCCCAATATTGCTTTTCCTGTG-3′) contained the endonuclease restriction sites for NcoI and BamHI (underlined), respectively. After digestion with the corresponding restriction enzyme, the fragment was ligated into plasmid pCS19 (obtained from C. Spiess). This plasmid is a derivative of pQE60 (a his-tag vector from Qiagen) and contained thelacI q gene ligated into the XbaI site of pQE60. The resulting open reading frame (His6)MalK carried a C-terminal extension of 10 amino acids: GSRSHHHHHH. The resulting plasmid was named pGG100. E. colistrain SF120 (8Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2696-2703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with pGG100 selecting for ampicillin resistance. The transformants were pooled and aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. These aliquots were used to inoculate overnight cultures subsequently used for large scale cultures. Cultivation was done in 6 liters of NZA medium (10 g NZ-amine A (Sheffield Products Inc.), 5 g of yeast extract, and 7.5 g of NaCl/liter) containing 200 mg of ampicillin/liter. After the culture reached an optical density at 578 nm (A 578) of 1, 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. 12 h later the culture was harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 80 ml of buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl), ruptured in a French pressure cell at 16,000 pounds/square inch, and centrifuged for 15 min at 19,000 × g. The supernatant was heated to 80 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation of the precipitated proteins (30 min at 19,000 × g), imidazol was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 20 mm. The solution was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (4-ml bed volume) from Qiagen equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column with 80 ml of buffer 1 (containing 20 mmimidazol), MalK was eluted with buffer 1 containing 100 mmimidazol. MalK-containing fractions (30 ml) were pooled and loaded onto a Reactive Red agarose 120 (3000-CL) column from Sigma (bed volume, 8 ml) equilibrated with buffer 1. The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of buffer 1. Elution of MalK was achieved by 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl. MalK-containing fractions (30 ml) were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The enzyme was stored at 4 °C without loss of activity. ATPase activity was determined colorimetrically (9Chan K.-M. Delfert D. Junger K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). 10 μg of MalK was added to 0.5 ml of ATPase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). The solution was heated to 80 °C, and the assay was initiated by adding ATP at 1 mmfinal concentration. After 5 min, the reaction was stopped by freezing in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the amount of liberated Pi was determined according to Chan et al. (9Chan K.-M. Delfert D. Junger K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). ATPase activity is given in units defined as the amount of enzyme liberating 1 μmol of Pi/min under the assay conditions. Protein determination was according to Bradford (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with reagents from Bio-Rad. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was according to Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The sequence ofmalK from T. litoralis (strain DSM 5473, maintained in the laboratory of Dr. H. Santos, Instituto de Tecnologia Quı́mica e Biol-gica, Universidade Nova de Lisboa) as shown in Fig. 1 has GenBank™ accession number AF121946. The sequence ofmalK of T. litoralis strain DSM 5473 maintained in the laboratory of Jocelyne DiRuggiero (Center of Marine Biotechnology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21202) has the accession number AF126010. A chicken was immunized five times with 100 μg of purified MalK. 14 days after the last immunization, antibodies were prepared from 10 eggs (12Polson A. von Wechmar M.B. van Regenmortel M.H. Immunol. Commun. 1980; 9: 475-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was done as described previously (13Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar, 14Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using the primary antibody (17 mg/ml) in a dilution of 1 to 10,000. The previous analysis of T. litoralis DNA harboring themalEFG cluster did not reveal the presence ofmalK. Upstream of malEFG we found an apparently unrelated gene (orf1) encoding a plant fructokinase homolog (GenBank™ accession number AF096373) and downstream, two genes (orf2 and orf3) with homology to a gene encoding a sugar phosphorylase (synthase) (15Saito K. Yamazaki H. Ohnishi Y. Fujimoto S. Takahashi E. Horinouchi S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and to cymJ ofKlebsiella oxytoca (16Pajatsch M. Gerhart M. Peist R. Horlacher R. Boos W. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2630-2635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Progress in the P. furiosus sequencing project 2R. Weiss, manuscript in preparation. revealed the presence of two similar but distinct genes that were homologous toE. coli malK. One of them was located close to the previously identified malG gene, directly adjacent and distal to cymJ. We realized that the mal gene cluster as well as the adjacent genes of T. litoralis were nearly identical to the corresponding cluster of P. furiosus. Primers designed from the P. furiosus malKsequence were used to clone the T. litoralis malK gene, using T. litoralis DNA provided by the laboratory of Helena Santos (Instituto de Tecnologia Quı́mica e Biológica, Universidade Nova de Lisboa). Dr. Santos obtained her T. litoralis strain DSM 5473 from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkultur GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into an expression vector that attached a 10-amino acid extension containing 6 histidine residues to the C terminus, resulting in plasmid pGG100. The recombinant malK gene was sequenced, and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig.1. The malK sequence has 30 base pair changes in comparison to the corresponding sequence of the same T. litoralis strain DSM 5473, which is maintained in the laboratory of J. DiRuggiero. This resulted in a difference of four amino acids in the two MalK protein sequences. In contrast, comparison of the malK sequence from T. litoralis(maintained in the laboratory of J. DiRuggiero) to that of P. furiosus showed only an exchange of 7 base pairs resulting in two altered amino acids. When the sequence of T. litoralis MalK (maintained in the laboratory of H. Santos) was compared with the corresponding sequence of P. furiosus, 37 base pair changes were observed resulting in the exchange of 6 amino acids. The important conclusion from this comparison is that T. litoralis andP. furiosus do contain the nearly identical binding protein-dependent trehalose/maltose ABC transport system. Attempts to identify in T. litoralis a second and nonidentical mal gene cluster that is present in P. furiosus did not yield any result. Fig. 2 shows an alignment of T. litoralis MalK protein with MalK proteins from several bacteria and a putative MalK protein from another archaeon (Pyrococcus horikoshii). As expected, the degree of sequence identity is high among the archaeal MalK proteins (80%), but surprisingly, it is also very high with MalK proteins from both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria ({sim]50%). The conserved regions are clustered around the recognized functional domains of MalK, i.e. Walker A and B motif and the ABC motif LSGGQ (linker peptide) (17Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the recently recognized H motif overlapping the switch region (18Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The sequence homology is still noticeable in the C-terminal half of the protein, which is lacking in some ABC proteins. In contrast, sequence comparison of the T. litoralis MalEFG subunits with the corresponding bacterial proteins revealed only 25–35% identity (6Horlacher R. Xavier K.B. Santos H. DiRuggiero J. Kossmann M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 680-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The T. litoralis MalK sequence (from the laboratory of H. Santos) has 50 positively and 52 negatively charged amino acids (11 and 9 more than the E. coli sequence, respectively) of a total of 372 amino acids (371 amino acids in E. coli MalK). Also,T. litoralis MalK contains 20 phenylalanines, which is 9 more than in E. coli, and 8 of these additional phenylalanines are in the less conserved C-terminal portion. Recombinant MalK protein was purified from strain SF120, which lacks several proteases (8Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2696-2703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain SF120 was transformed with pGG100 and grown at 28 °C in rich medium (NZA) to an A 578 of about 1 before the expression of malK was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Under these conditions, MalK does not form inclusion bodies but remains as a soluble protein in the cytoplasm. It was purified from the soluble cellular extract by heat treatment (80 °C for 10 min), Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography, and dye ligand chromatography on Red agarose. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to follow the purification protocol (Fig.3). The total yield of purified recombinant MalK from a 6-liter culture was routinely between 40 and 60 mg. Molecular sieve chromatography gave no hint for multimerization. MalK eluted as a symmetric peak with a calculated molecular weight of 40,000 (data not shown). Samples of MalK with and without ATP were investigated by dynamic light scattering (19Brown R.G.W. Burnett J.G. Mansbridge J. Moir C.I. Appl. Optics. 1990; 29: 4159-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) at different temperatures using a DynaPro mass spectrometry instrument. Values of mean particle radius and estimated molecular weight were essentially identical for both samples (data not shown). After the last purification step (Fig. 3), the sample still contained small amounts of a contaminating protein of about 29,000 daltons that could not be removed. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the contaminant revealed that it contained a part of the MalK sequence starting with methionine-178. Inspection of the upstream DNA sequence suggested that this protein might originate from a second translational start site. Apparently, restart from within an open reading frame of DNA from hyperthermophilic archaea heterologously expressed in E. coli is not uncommon (20Hess D. Hensel R. Gene. 1996; 172: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The purified protein showed ATPase activity. Fig. 4 shows that the activity was highest at 80 °C but hardly measurable at room temperature. Incubating the protein in buffer at 80 °C resulted in loss of activity with a half-life time of 45 min. At 80 °C we determined a pH optimum of 7.0 (Fig. 5), a K m of 155 μm, and aV max of 0.55 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein (Fig. 6). ADP and ATPγS were not substrates but competitive inhibitors for ATP hydrolysis (K i values of 230 μm). GTP and CTP were also hydrolyzed with K m values of 430 μm and 870 μm, andV max values of 0.45 and 0.32 μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively (Fig. 5). ATPase activity was inhibited by 10, 60, and 97% after incubating the enzyme with 10 μm, 100 μm, and 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 5 min. The additional presence of 1 mm ATP during incubation largely prevented inactivation by 1 mm NEM (75% remaining activity). In agreement with the property of MalK fromSalmonella typhimurium, ATPase activity was not inhibited by 10 mm vanadate (21Morbach S. Tebbe S. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18617-18621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5pH dependence of the ATPase activity ofT. litoralis MalK measured at 80 °C.

Wilken S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20456-20461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We saw the same magnitude of an apparent fluorescence quenching by ATP when using T. litoralis MalK. However, we also observed this quenching with serum albumin and conclude that ATP and other nucleotides generally interfere with fluorescence measurement by a filter effect, reducing both excitation and emission. Thus, we believe that the apparent reduction in fluorescence by ATP cannot be taken as evidence for a protein conformational change. Even though the protein has ATPase activity and showed a surprisingly high sequence identity with E. coli MalK, the recombinantT. litoralis MalK was not able to complement amalK mutant of E. coli for growth on maltose at 37 °C when expressed from the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced plasmid pGG100. It was also unable to affect mal gene expression as does E. coli MalK when overproduced (23Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The malK gene from the T. litoralis strain maintained in the laboratory of J. DiRuggiero has also been cloned and overexpressed, and the protein was purified in the same manner as described above. This protein showed the same biochemical characteristics as the other MalK species. Thus, the difference in four amino acids does not seem to have an effect on the activity of the protein. The purified His-tagged protein was used to obtain polyclonal antibodies in chicken. This antiserum was able to recognize MalK in extracts of T. litoralis. We tested the amount of MalK in T. litoralis by Western blotting of extracts from cells grown in peptone with and without the addition of maltose, trehalose, and yeast extract. Fig.7 shows that MalK was induced by maltose, trehalose, and yeast extract. The induction appeared less pronounced than the induction of the cognate TMBP and the corresponding transport activity in intact cells (Fig. 7) (6Horlacher R. Xavier K.B. Santos H. DiRuggiero J. Kossmann M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 680-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this publication we describe the cloning of malKfrom the hyperthermophilic archaeon T. litoralis, its expression in E. coli, and the purification and biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein. With the exception ofmalK, the organization of the T. litoralistrehalose/maltose transport operon malEFG (Fig. 1) is very similar to that of E. coli and other bacterial binding protein-dependent ABC transport systems (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium; Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, DC1996: 1175-1209Google Scholar). At present it is unclear whether or not malK is expressed from a different promoter than malEFG. The Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 6 suggests that malK is coregulated withmalEFG. The open reading frames orf3 andmalK are separated by only five nucleotides, indicating translational coupling of the two genes that might form an operon. 32 nucleotides upstream of the translational start of orf3 the sequence TTTTAAA points to the presence of an element identical with the consensus sequence of archaeal promoters (Box A) (24Thomm M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 159-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The T. litoralis MalK protein exhibits an astonishingly high sequence identity of 50% with the E. coli protein (25Shuman H.A. Silhavy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 560-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gilson E. Nikaido H. Hofnung M.

Genet. 1989; 218: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the T. litoralis protein has 23% more positively and 17% more negatively charged amino acids than theE. coli protein, which is in agreement with the notion that ionic interactions are important for high thermostability (28Vetriani C. Maeder D.L. Tolliday N. Yip K.S.-P. Stillman T.J. Britton K.L. Rice D.W. Klump H.H. Robb F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12300-12305Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Even the nonidentical part of T. litoralis MalK appears highly homologous to the E. coli protein. Walker A and B motifs are well conserved as is the intervening linker region LSGGQQ, the established ABC signature (29Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Purified His-tagged MalK heterologously expressed in E. coli shows ATPase activity that is comparable in its kinetic constants with the well studied MalK protein from S. typhimurium (21Morbach S. Tebbe S. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18617-18621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli MalK is known to be involved in the regulation ofmal gene expression. Several amino acids in its C-terminal part define a domain responsible for this repressor function (23Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kühnau S. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2180-2186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Repression works via an interaction of MalK with the transcriptional activator MalT (31Panagiotidis C.H. Boos W. Shuman H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). None of the amino acids of E. coli MalK that supposedly participate in the MalK-MalT interaction are conserved in the T. litoralis MalK sequence. At present it cannot be directly proven that the MalK protein, purified and characterized in this publication, is really part of the trehalose/maltose transport machinery. This can only be inferred from the position of the malK gene next to the malEFGcluster and from the induction pattern. The two genes orf2 and orf3 that separate malEFG frommalK encode open reading frames with homology to a sugar phosphorylase (synthase) (15Saito K. Yamazaki H. Ohnishi Y. Fujimoto S. Takahashi E. Horinouchi S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and a CymJ protein. Whereas the role (if any) of orf2 in a (trehalose/maltose) transport gene cluster is unclear, the presence of cymJ has been observed previously in a gene cluster of Klebsiella oxytoca encoding a binding protein-dependent ABC transporter for cyclic dextrins (16Pajatsch M. Gerhart M. Peist R. Horlacher R. Boos W. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2630-2635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of CymJ remains unknown. There are more differences between the two T. litoralis malKsequences than to the corresponding sequence from P. furiosus. This is probably due to mutations that accumulated over the multiple cell generations. Because the two T. litoralisstrains have been maintained in different laboratories under different conditions, it is not surprising that the mutations appear. We found that the sequences of the mal genes and adjacent genes in T. litoralis are nearly identical to those in theP. furiosus genome. Interestingly, such a gene cluster has not been found in the genome of the closely related archaeon P. horikoshii. There, the homologous malE malF malG orf2 and orf3 cluster is present but lacks the downstreammalK (32Kawarabayasi Y. Sawada M. Horikawa H. Haikawa Y. Hino Y. Yamamoto S. Sekine M. Baba S. Kosugi H. Hosoyama A. Nagai Y. Sakai M. Ogura K. Otsuka R. Nakazawa H. Takamiya M. Ohfuku Y. Funahashi T. Tanaka T. Kudoh Y. Yamazaki J. Kushida N. Oguchi A. Aoki K. Kikuchi H. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Yet, this genome contains several genes encoding ABC proteins with high homology to MalK from T. litoralis, the one fitting best showing 80% sequence identity (cf.Fig. 2). This raises the possibility not only of a gene transfer between P. furiosus and T. litoralis 3Flanked by inverted sequence elements inP. furiosus, this gene cluster is evidence for a recent horizontal gene transfer between two organisms (J. DiRuggiero, G. Greller, R. Horlacher, and W. Boos, manuscript in preparation. but also between bacteria (likely Gram-positive bacteria (33Gupta R.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1435-1491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and archaea (34Aravind L. Tatusov R.L. Wolf Y.I. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Trends Genet. 1988; 14: 442-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Analysis of the many complete genomes that have been published in the last few years has shown that in archaea most of the information-processing genes (i.e. for replication, repair, transcription, and translation) are more closely related to eukaryal genes, whereas their metabolic genes are more closely related to bacterial genes. Nevertheless, binding protein-dependent transport systems must have appeared early in evolution. A gene cluster supposedly encoding a maltose transport machinery also exists in T. maritima which, like T. litoralis in the archaea, is one of the most deeply branched bacteria with a maximum growth temperature of 90 °C (35Liebl W. Stemplinger I. Ruile P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 941-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We gratefully acknowledge the receipt of plasmid pCS19 from Christoph Spiess."
https://openalex.org/W2003424893,"Two exocellular nucleases with molecular masses of 18 and 34 kDa, which are nutritionally regulated and reach their maximum activity during aerial mycelium formation and sporulation, have been detected in Streptomyces antibioticus. Their function appears to be DNA degradation in the substrate mycelium, and in agreement with this proposed role the two nucleases cooperate efficiently with a periplasmic nuclease previously described inStreptomyces antibioticus to completely hydrolyze DNA. The nucleases cut DNA nonspecifically, leaving 5′-phosphate mononucleotides as the predominant products. Both proteins require Mg2+, and the additional presence of Ca2+ notably stimulates their activities. The two nucleases are inhibited by Zn2+and aurin tricarboxylic acid. The 18-kDa nuclease fromStreptomyces is reminiscent of NUC-18, a thymocyte nuclease proposed to have a key role in glucocorticoid-stimulated apoptosis. The 18-kDa nuclease was shown, by amino-terminal protein sequencing, to be a member of the cyclophilin family and also to possess peptidylprolylcis-trans-isomerase activity. NUC-18 has also been shown to be a cyclophilin, and “native” cyclophilins are capable of DNA degradation. The S. antibioticus 18-kDa nuclease is produced by a proteolytic processing from a less active protein precursor. The protease responsible has been identified as a serine protease that is inhibited byN α -p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone and leupeptin. Inhibition of both of the nucleases or the protease impairs aerial mycelium development in S. antibioticus.

The biochemical features of cellular DNA degradation during Streptomyces development show significant analogies with the late steps of apoptosis of eukaryotic cells. The actinomycetes are a large group of filamentous bacteria that are adapted for growth in soil by forming a ramifying network, called a mycelium. Within this group the predominant isolates belong to the genus Streptomyces, which produce a well developed branched mycelium on agar plates, resulting in a compact colony. In the vegetative phase, the filaments often lack cross-walls (substrate mycelium) and thus have several copies of the chromosome. When the colony ages, a characteristic aerial mycelium is formed, in response to unknown signals involving nutrient limitation, which subsequently fragment and/or sporulate by the synchronous formation of cross-walls in the multinucleate sporophores followed by separation of the individual cells directly into spores. This is similar to the growth and differentiation of fungi, and from the morphological and metabolic points of view, Streptomyces can be considered as boundary organisms (1Omura S. Queener S.W. Day L.E. The Bacteria. IX. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: xvii-xxxiGoogle Scholar). Coincident with the morphological differentiation, the streptomycetes produce numerous compounds (secondary metabolites) within which antibiotics are of commercial relevance. As corresponds to their habitat, these bacteria are nutritionally quite versatile, and most produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes that permit the utilization of polysaccharides, proteins, fats, and other substrates. In this way, the substrate mycelium promote the solubilization of high molecular weight biopolymers. In addition, the onset of aerial mycelium formation coincides with a noticeable lysis of the substrate hyphae (2Wildermuth H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 60: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,3Méndez C. Braña A.F. Manzanal M.B. Hardisson C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1985; 31: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This fact, together with the absence of an increase in dry weight during the development of the aerial mycelium and the displacement of labeled protein precursors from the substrate to the aerial mycelium (3Méndez C. Braña A.F. Manzanal M.B. Hardisson C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1985; 31: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), supports the hypothesis that the aerial mycelium reuses material first assimilated into the substrate mycelium. These events, which occur in stressful environmental conditions, are directed to generate and disseminate spores that have a greater potential for survival. The lytic phenomenon observed in the substrate mycelium and the subsequent transformation of aerial mycelium into spores can be considered as a programmed cell death (4Hochman A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that takes place within a developmental program (similar to metazoan differentiation) that contributes to the adaptation of the bacteria to the environment. Streptomyces is a great producer of proteolytic enzymes (5Rao M.B. Tanksale A.M. Ghatge M.N. Deshpande V.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 597-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is assumed that extracellular proteases produced in actinomycetes participate in the assimilation of the extracellular proteinaceous nitrogen sources (6Shapiro S. Regulation of Secondary Metabolism in Actinomycetes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 149-153Google Scholar). However, the proteases involved in the hydrolysis of the substrate mycelium proteins have not been unequivocally identified. The serine-type protease activity produced during the late stationary phase in Streptomyces peucetius has been suggested to have a role in cellular turnover on solid substrates (7Gibb G.D. Strohl W.R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1988; 34: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Like other hydrolytic exocytoplasmic enzymes, the synthesis of deoxyribonucleases in Streptomyces has also been associated with a nutritional role (8Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Hopwood D.A. Chater K.F. Genetics of Bacterial Diversity. Academic Press, London1989: 129-150Google Scholar). However, there are very few reports of their presence (9Yanagida T. Ogawara H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1980; 33: 1206-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or biochemical characteristics (10Vukelic B. Ritonja A. Vitale LJ. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 43: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Our group has carried out a detailed biochemical characterization of several nucleases that showed novel specificities for the hydrolysis of DNA and are associated with the cell wall domain in Streptomyces glaucescens and Streptomyces antibioticus (11Aparicio J.F.

Although these enzymes can circumstantially restrict the growth of actinophages (11Aparicio J.F. De los Reyes-Gavilán C.G. Barbes C. Hardisson C. Sánchez J. J. Gen.

The nucleases are active as monomers and nick double-stranded DNA at dG/dC-rich sequences, which would make the high dG + dC Streptomyces DNA an excellent substrate (16Aparicio J.F. Freije J.M.P. Lopez-Otin C. Cal S. Sánchez J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 17Cal S. Aparicio J.F. de los Reyes-Gavilán C.G. Nicieza R.G. Sánchez J. Biochem.

The end products of the hydrolysis of these enzymes are fragments from 7–24 base pairs (for S. glaucescensnuclease) or 35–250 base pairs (for S. antibioticusnuclease). The residual fragments have 5′ or 3′ short single-stranded overhangs with 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphate termini (16Aparicio J.F. Freije J.M.P. Lopez-Otin C. Cal S. Sánchez J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 17Cal S. Aparicio J.F. de los Reyes-Gavilán C.G. Nicieza R.G. Sánchez J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The specificity and interaction of the S. antibioticus nuclease with oligodeoxynucleotide substrates containing dG base analogues were further analyzed in detail (18Cal S. Nicieza R.G. Connolly B.A. Sanchez J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10828-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A detailed study of the production of this enzyme in surface cultures of S. antibioticus showed that the appearance of the nuclease always precedes differentiation (14De los Reyes-Gavilán C.G. Cal S. Barbes C. Hardisson C. Sánchez J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 136: 299-305Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Following the role postulated for proteases in the “parasitic” behavior of the aerial mycelium with respect to the substrate mycelium, we proposed an analogous function of the S. antibioticus and S. glaucescens nucleasesi.e. the recycling of DNA deoxynucleotides from the substrate to the aerial mycelium (14De los Reyes-Gavilán C.G. Cal S. Barbes C. Hardisson C. Sánchez J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 136: 299-305Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 16Aparicio J.F. Freije J.M.P. Lopez-Otin C. Cal S. Sánchez J. Eur. J.

The periplasmic location of these enzymes would permit them to gain access to the DNA after the lysis of the mycelium. However, other nuclease activities would be required to degrade the nicked and fragmented DNA, produced by the dG/dC-specific nucleases, to the deoxynucleotide level (18Cal S. Nicieza R.G. Connolly B.A. Sanchez J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10828-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We describe in this work two predominant, nonspecific nucleases in the exocellular fraction of S. antibioticus grown under both surface and submerged conditions. The biochemical characteristics of the purified enzymes have been analyzed, including their capacity to complement the action of the periplasmic enzymes described above. One of the nucleases has been identified as a cyclophilin, a class of proteins previously proposed to have a role in cell death (19Montague J.W. Cidlowski J.A. Experientia. 1996; 52: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Montague J.W. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

Also we describe a serine protease that is likely to be involved in the production of active nucleases by proteolytic processing of larger less active precursors. The enzymes analyzed in Streptomyces and the overall process of aerial mycelium formation both show significant analogies with the enzymes and steps described during apoptosis in eukaryotic cells. S. antibioticusATCC11891 was cultured in solid or liquid GAE medium (glucose, asparagine, yeast extract, and salts) (3Méndez C. Braña A.F. Manzanal M.B. Hardisson C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1985; 31: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) at 30 °C and 200 rpm in the case of submerged conditions. Nuclease activity was measured by the formation of acid-soluble DNA products. The standard reaction mixture contained 4 μg of calf thymus DNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 7 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2 (activity buffer). When required, alternative divalent cation combinations were tested, the concentration of NaCl was varied, and the effects of other components (e.g. iodoacetate, EDTA, EGTA, and aurin tricarboxylic acid (ATA) 1The abbreviations ATAaurin tricarboxylic acidTLPtrypsin-like proteaseMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyAPalkaline phosphatasePNKpolynucleotide kinaseTLCKNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketoneCADcaspase-activated deoxyribonucleaseICADinhibitor of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease ) were investigated (see “Results” for exact conditions). The effects of pH variation were studied using 20 mm levels of sodium acetate (pH 4.0–5.5), Mes (pH 5.0–6.5), Tris (pH 7.0–9.0), Hepes (pH 6.5–8.5), and glycine (pH 8.0–11.0). After the appropriate incubation times at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 10% trichloroacetic acid plus 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate (22Fraser M.J.

The activity was expressed by the increase in the absorbance at 260 nm in the supernatant after trichloroacetic acid precipitation. One unit of the enzyme activity is equivalent to an increase inA 260 of 0.015 obtained under the above reaction conditions.

The nucleases were directly extruded from the medium by forcing the agar through the nozzle (about 2 mm across) of a 20-ml plastic syringe (Becton Dickinson) without needle. The resulting suspension was centrifuged, at 4 °C, for 30 min at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm diameter Millipore cellulose-acetate filter to eliminate the remaining agar. Samples were concentrated by acetone precipitation (1:3 (v/v) sample:acetone; −20 °C for 45 min; centrifugation) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 7 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl. The nucleases were separated using a 12% SDS-PAGE gel containing 10 μg/ml of denatured calf thymus DNA. SDS for these experiments was from BDH Laboratory Supplies (Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom). Following electrophoresis, the proteins were renatured by repeatedly washing the gel with the above buffer (2 h, at 4 °C) followed by Milli-Q-purified water at room temperature (23Rosenthal A. Lacks S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 76-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Nuclease activity was visualized by incubating the gels, for 4 h at 37 °C, in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 10% Me2SO following by staining with ethidium bromide and viewing under UV light. Micrococcal nuclease and bovine pancreatic DNase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were included as controls. DNA degradation in the substrate mycelium of S. antibioticus was analyzed after a controlled extraction from the cells and medium and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. The plates were homogenized by slowly forcing the agar through a 20-ml plastic syringe without needle, as described above. To the agar paste, 0.2 m phosphate-citric acid buffer, pH 7.8, containing 20 mm EDTA and 0.1% Triton X-100 was added, and the agar suspension was carefully mixed, at 30 °C, for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged (4 °C) at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatant was then extracted with an equal volume of buffered phenol (1×) and with a 1:1 phenol/chloroform mixture (2×). DNA was precipitated, from the aqueous phase, with 3m sodium acetate/ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and air-dried. The precipitate was gently resuspended in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl and treated with RNase A (50 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. After a further precipitation and washing, the DNA was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA buffer and analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining. The 34-kDa nuclease was purified from liquid GAE cultures after 28–34-h incubation at 30 °C. Mycelia were pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C), and the proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with (NH4)2SO4. The fraction obtained between 60 and 80% (NH4)2SO4saturation (fraction 1) was resuspended in buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNaN3, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mmNaCl) and dialyzed overnight against this buffer. The resulting solution was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (flow rate of 24 ml/h) in buffer A containing 0.1m NaCl and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–1m NaCl in buffer A. The enzyme eluted at 0.3 msalt (fraction 2). Following dialysis against buffer A, fraction 2 was applied to a heparin-agarose column (Sigma) (flow rate of 6 ml/h) and eluted with a linear gradient of 50 mm to 0.5 msalt. The nuclease eluted at 0.21 m NaCl (fraction 3). This fraction was dialyzed against buffer A, applied to a Mono-Q HR 5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (flow rate of 0.5 ml/min), and eluted with a linear gradient of 50 mm to 0.5 mNaCl. The nuclease eluted at 0.25 m NaCl to give fraction 4, which was concentrated using a Centricon 10 (Amicon). The concentrated fraction 4 was applied, in 200-μl volumes, to a Superdex G-75 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and eluted with buffer A plus 0.15 m NaCl. The fractions containing pure protein (fraction 5) were concentrated (Centricon 10) and stored at −20 °C in buffer A with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1m NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol. During the purification process, the nuclease was detected by activity gel analysis and also by visualization of the products of λ DNA hydrolysis using gel electrophoresis (see above). When necessary, protein concentration was estimated colorimetrically (17Cal S. Aparicio J.F. de los Reyes-Gavilán C.G. Nicieza R.G. Sánchez J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The purification of the 18-kDa nuclease followed that of the 34-kDa nuclease up to the preparation of fraction 1 dialyzed against buffer A. This fraction was then was then applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column and eluted in one step with buffer A plus 0.1 m NaCl to give fraction 2. The sample was concentrated by acetone precipitation (1:5 (v/v); −20 °C for 45 min), resuspended in buffer A with 25 mm NaCl, and applied to a single-stranded DNA-cellulose affinity column (Sigma). The nuclease was eluted in buffer A plus 50 mm NaCl to give fraction 3. The sample was concentrated (Centricon 10) and applied to a Superdex-G-75 HR 10/30 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using buffer A containing 0.15m NaCl. The homogeneous protein (fraction 4) was concentrated and stored at −20 °C in the same buffer used to store the 34-kDa nuclease. The 74-kDa nuclease precursor was partially purified from 14–18-h cultures by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation (80% saturation) and chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel using the same conditions as those described above for the 18-kDa enzyme. The purity of the enzymes after the last purification step was assessed by SDS-PAGE using silver staining (17Cal S. Aparicio J.F. de los Reyes-Gavilán C.G. Nicieza R.G. Sánchez J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and also by activity gel analysis (see above). For the analysis of the molecular mass in SDS-PAGE, bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (36 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), trypsinogen (24 kDa), and trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa) were used as standards. Sequencing of the amino-terminal end of the purified 34- and 18-kDa nucleases was carried out by an Edman degradation after the electrophoretic transfer of the protein to a polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon membrane (24Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel filtration chromatography on Superdex-G-75 (operated as described in the purification protocols above) was used to determine the native molecular masses of the 18- and 34-kDa nuclease. The column was calibrated with proteins of known molecular mass (all obtained from Sigma): bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa). All digestions by the 18- and 34-kDa nucleases were carried out in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2 (activity buffer) at 37 °C. For the determination of the phosphodiester bond cleaved, phage λ DNA (3 μg) was partially digested with 4 units of the nucleases for 30, 60, and 120 min. The resulting DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and divided into two aliquots, one of which was further treated with alkaline phosphatase (AP) (1 unit for 1 h) (17Cal S. Aparicio J.F. de los Reyes-Gavilán C.G. Nicieza R.G. Sánchez J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Following AP treatment, the DNA in this aliquot was purified by phenol/chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and ethanol/sodium acetate precipitation. The DNA in both aliquots was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (18Cal S. Nicieza R.G. Connolly B.A. Sanchez J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10828-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and the labeled DNA was separated from excess [γ-32P]ATP by successive ethanol precipitations. The radioactivity present in the DNA was determined using scintillation counting. To confirm that 5′-phosphates were formed, labeled fragments were produced using the 18/34-kDa nuclease/AP/PNK and further treated with nuclease P1 (2 units for 1 h) (Sigma) in 5 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.3. The products were analyzed by TLC using poly(ethyleneimine) cellulose F plates as described before (16Aparicio J.F. Freije J.M.P. Lopez-Otin C. Cal S. Sánchez J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The spots were detected by autoradiography. Endonucleolytic activity was detected by the hydrolysis of the closed circular plasmid pBR322 (0.2 μg) (MBI-Fermentas) with the 18- and 34-kDa nucleases for between 0 and 60 min. Starting materials and products were separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and detected using ethidium bromide staining. DNA hydrolysis specificity was investigated using a double helical oligodeoxyribonucleotide, 36 bases in length, composed of ATCCAATGAGTACCTGGGGGACTTAGGAGCTTACTC and its complementary strand (18Cal S. Nicieza R.G. Connolly B.A. Sanchez J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10828-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Labeling at the 5′ terminus was carried out using 10 pmol of the substrate with PNK and [γ-32P]ATP. Hybridization of the complementary oligonucleotides was carried out as described (18Cal S. Nicieza R.G. Connolly B.A. Sanchez J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10828-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic products of the nucleases were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis using 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 7m urea. The bands produced were detected by autoradiography. DNA digestion by a combination of the S. antibioticusperiplasmic nuclease and the 18- or 34-kDa exocellular nucleases was investigated by first treating calf thymus DNA with the periplasmic enzyme, followed by hydrolysis with either of the two exocellular enzymes. Calf thymus DNA (4 μg) was treated with 8 units of the purified periplasmic nuclease (18Cal S. Nicieza R.G. Connolly B.A. Sanchez J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10828-10836Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) for 10 min. The DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and ethanol/sodium acetate precipitation and hydrolyzed with 4 units of the 18- or the 34-kDa nuclease in the activity buffer described above. The activity was followed by measuring the absorbance of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble products. The purified 18-kDa nuclease was tested for this activity, as described previously (25Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The substrate used wasN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Bachem, Feinchemikalien AG) at 50 μm concentration in 1 ml of 35 mm Hepes, pH 8.0. The substrate and 18-kDa nuclease were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature before the addition of 400 μg of α-chymotrypsin (Sigma). The reaction was followed, at 390 nm, for 3 min at 12 °C. The existence of a nuclease precursor was inferred from two types of experiments. In one of them, the proteins were extruded from plates of GAE medium and concentrated by acetone precipitation, as detailed above in the activity gel analysis section. The precipitate was resuspended in buffer A (see above) and loaded in a DEAE-Sephacel column, as already specified for the purification of the nucleases. The proteins were eluted as described for the 34-kDa nuclease. The fraction corresponding to the peak of maximum activity was used for the detection of the proteolytic processing. This was visualized by the appearance of nuclease bands, after activity gel analysis, and by an increase in the nucleolytic activity, measured on λ DNA (see above). In other assays, the 74-kDa hypothetical precursor of the 18-kDa nuclease was partially purified, as specified in the above section, and subjected to the activity of the purified serine protease 2J. Huergo, R. Gonzalez, and J. Sanchez, manuscript in preparation. present in the fractions used for the detection of the proteolytic processing (as detailed under “Results”). The resulting products were analyzed by activity gel and immunoreactivity, using the antibody raised against the 18-kDa nuclease (see below). To test the effect of nuclease and protease inhibitors on aerial mycelium formation, Petri dishes of 5-cm diameter were used. ZnCl2 was added in 0.25 ml of water to the surface of previously grown plates (times detailed under “Results”).N α -p-tosyl-l-lysine ch"

To elucidate the importance and function of XCE, we disrupted its gene in mouse embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination and created mice deficient in XCE. The resulting phenotype is characterized by neonatal lethality. All XCE −/− homozygous mice died of respiratory failure shortly after birth, and in most cases their lungs were never ventilated. Apart from the atelectasis, anatomical and histological examinations of embryonic day 18.5 XCE −/− embryos and newborn homozygotes did not reveal any obvious abnormalities in organs and tissues. Malformations that are related to the knock-out were also not found in the skeletons of XCE −/− mice. In addition, XCE knock-out animals showed no deficiency of pulmonary surfactant proteins and had normal heart beat frequencies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that XCE is an essential gene. The phenotype of the XCE-deficient mice together with the central nervous system-specific expression further suggest that XCE may play a vital role in the control of respiration.

XCE is the latest member of the zinc metallopeptidase family, which includes the endothelin-converting enzymes ECE-1 and ECE-2, NEP (neutral endopeptidase or enkephalinase), Kell blood group antigen (KELL), and PEX (for a review, see Ref. 1Turner A.J. Tanzawa K. FASEB J. 1997; 1: 355-364Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The corresponding cDNA was cloned recently from human caudate nucleus and spinal cord cDNA libraries (2Valdenaire O. Richards J.G. Faull R.L.M. Schweizer A. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It encodes a type II transmembrane protein of 775 amino acids with a short cytosolic tail of 59 residues and a large luminal domain that contains the characteristic zinc-binding motif HEXXH. XCE shares the highest homology with ECE-1 (53% homology and 42% identity over the last 500 amino acids), but in contrast to ECE-1 it is only present as a single transcript. Expression in various cell types revealed a 95-kDa glycosylated protein consistent with the presence of three putative sites for Asn-linked glycosylation in its cDNA.

Mutations in the PEX gene are responsible for the inherited renal disorder X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (14The HYP Consortium Nat.

Although Kell (16Lee S. Zambas E.D. Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6353-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,17Lee S. Vox Sang. 1997; 73: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) is still an “orphan enzyme,” it is clear that Kell blood group antigen incompatibility can be associated with severe problems including hemolytic disease of the newborn. The sequence similarity between XCE and members of the NEP/ECE family, in particular the presence of the zinc binding motif HEXXH and the conservation of several amino acids that are crucial for the enzymatic activity in NEP and ECE-1, suggests that XCE functions as a membrane-bound metallopeptidase. The enzyme substrate, as yet unidentified, might be found among the numerous neuropeptide transmitters that colocalize with acetylcholine in the XCE-positive neurons in the CNS. In the present study, we disrupted the XCE gene by homologous recombination and created XCE-deficient mice to gain insight into the importance and physiological role of XCE. We demonstrate that the deletion of XCE results in neonatal lethality and have investigated potential anatomical, skeletal, and histological abnormalities. Genomic clones of XCE were obtained by screening a λ FIXII mouse 129/sv genomic library (Stratagene) with a 654-bp partial rat XCE cDNA (2Valdenaire O. Richards J.G. Faull R.L.M. Schweizer A. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Positive phages encompassing the putative catalytic domain of XCE were mapped and partially sequenced. To generate the targeting vector, the polylinker of the Bluescript vector (Stratagene) was first modified by insertion of two complementary oligonucleotides encodingXhoI-HindIII-BamHI-SalI-NotI restriction sites into the unique XhoI and NotI sites of pBSK resulting in the vector pBSK poly1. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) gene for thymidine kinase (TK) driven by the HSV-TK promoter was subcloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of this pBSK poly1 giving plasmid pBSK poly 1-TK. The 5′-flanking arm consisting of a 1956-bp BglII XCE genomic fragment (recloned as XhoI-HindIII fragment) was then inserted together with a neomycin resistance cassette (excised asXhoI-BamHI fragment from pMC1 neo; Stratagene) downstream of the TK into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pBSK poly1-TK in a tripartite ligation (pBSK poly1-TK-XCE5′-neo). In a last step, an approximately 7-kbHindIII genomic XCE fragment (recloned asSalI-NotI fragment) was inserted downstream of the neomycin resistance cassette into the SalI andNotI sites of pBSK poly1-TK-XCE5′-neo to generate the 3′-flanking arm. In the resulting targeting vector (see Fig.1 A), the 1076 bp of XCE sequence between the two flanking arms including the coding sequence for the zinc binding motif HELTH is replaced by the 1087-bp neomycin resistance cassette. The construct was linearized at its unique NotI site prior to transfection. An E14 ES cell line was grown on a feeder layer of irradiated neomycin-resistant mouse embryonic fibroblasts in standard ES medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids, and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 20 × 106 ES cells were electroporated with 25 μg of the linearized targeting vector and selected for double resistance to G418 and ganciclovir (Life Technologies, Inc.). The selection was started at day 2 with 350 μg/ml G418. On day 3 ganciclovir was added to a final concentration of 2 μm and was kept in the medium for 3 days. After 10 days double-resistant clones were isolated and expanded for Southern blot analysis and freezing. For Southern blotting genomic DNA from these clones was isolated using the DNazol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), digested with BamHI, and hybridized with the 271-bp 5′ external probe shown in Fig. 1 A using standard techniques. The sizes of the wild-type and targeted fragments were approximately 9 and 3.3 kb, respectively. From 100 clones analyzed, 25 homologous recombinants were identified. One correctly targeted ES cell clone was injected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts, and resulting chimeric males were bred to C57BL/6 females to produce heterozygous F1 mice carrying the targeted allele. XCE +/− mice were then interbred to obtain homozygotes. Genotyping of postnatal day 7–14 mice, newborn pups, and embryos was performed by Southern blot analysis and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Qiagen, solution Q system). Genomic DNA was isolated from tail biopsies using proteinase K (18Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acid Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers used for PCR detection were ATGGGTCACTGGTCCCTTTC (P1), TGTTCTCGCCAAGTGTGTGTTTCCC (P2), and CCGGAGAACCTGCGTGCAATCC (P3) (see Fig. 1 A). The reaction was cycled 30 times (14 s 96 °C, 15 s 60 °C, and 90 s 72 °C), which amplified a 864-bp fragment in wild-type +/+ animals, a 410-bp fragment in knock-out −/− mice, and both a 864-bp and 410-bp fragment in heterozygous animals. For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and hybridized as described above. RT-PCR was performed on total RNA prepared from day 18.5 embryonic brains (analysis of XCE) or lungs (analysis of surfactant-associated proteins) using the RNA-PLUS kit (Quantum-Bioprobe). First strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primers with the Reverse Transcription System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For PCR amplification of a 500-bp XCE fragment, sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were 5′-CCGTCAAAAAGATTCGACAGGAGGTGG-3′ and 5′-TGCAAAGGCAATGAAGAAAAGCTGG-3′, respectively. These primers were deduced from mouse sequence located 5′ (5th exon in Fig. 1 A) and 3′ (11th exon in Fig. 1 A) of the disrupted region (8th to 10th exon in Fig. 1 A) and correspond to bp 1854–1880 and bp 2353–2329 of the human cDNA, respectively. For the semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of surfactant-associated proteins, cDNA was amplified using the following primers: mouse SP-A (406-bp fragment), 5′-GATCAAACATCAGATTCTGCAAACAATGGG-3′ and 5′-AAATTCACAAATGGCCAGCCGGTACTGCAGGC-3′; mouse SP-B (342-bp fragment), 5′-CTTGTCCTCCGATCTTCCACTGAGGATGCC-3′ and 5′-GAGGTGTGGGGTTTGGAACGACTGCAGAGG-3′; mouse SP-C (452-bp fragment), 5′-TGGTCCTCGTTGTCGTGGTGATTGTAGGGG-3′ and 5′-GATATAGTAGAGTGGTAGCTCTCCACACAGGG-3′; and mouse SP-D (403-bp fragment), 5′-GGTTGCCTTCTCCCACTATCAGAAAGCTGC-3′ and 5′-TCAGAACTCACAGATAACAAGGCGCTGCTCTCC-3′. Mouse β-actin (605-bp fragment) was analyzed as an internal control for normalization. Appropriate dilutions were determined for each cDNA preparation and amplified fragment (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D, and β-actin) to ensure that the resulting PCR products were derived only from the exponential phase of the amplification. The reaction was cycled 26 times (30 s 94 °C, 30 s 55 °C, and 30 s 72 °C). Aliquots of the PCR reaction were subjected to electrophoresis and the products visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The gel image was digitized with a video camera, and the intensity of the bands was quantitated with the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). C-sectioned embryos on day 18.5 of gestation and newborn pups were first analyzed for external alterations. For visceral examinations, fetuses and pups from various litters were preserved and subsequently studied for soft tissue anomalies according to Barrow and Taylor (19Barrow M.W. Taylor W.J. J. Morphol. 1969; 127: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). For the skeletal analysis, fetal E18.5 skeletons from several litters were processed with Alizarin Red S stain according to Dawson (20Dawson A.A. Stain Technol. 1926; 1: 123-124Crossref Scopus (960) Google Scholar). For the determination of heart beat frequencies, C-sectioned embryos on day 12 of gestation were placed in prewarmed Williams' Medium E (Life Technologies) containing 10% rat serum. The heart beats were counted three times for 1 min each. All animals and organs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The following organs were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 2–3 μm, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for routine histological examination: Adrenal glands, aorta, brain, eyes, heart, mesenteric lymph nodes, kidneys, small and large intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, rectum) liver, lungs, esophagus, pancreas, salivary glands, skin, spleen, stomach, thymus, thyroid/parathyroid, urinary bladder, and trachea. Serial sections were performed of the brainstem and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or cresyl fast violet to demonstrate Nissl substance. We used homologous recombination in ES cells to generate mice lacking functional XCE. Genomic clones of the mouse XCE gene were isolated from a 129/sv mouse genomic library, mapped, and partially sequenced. The luminal domain of XCE contains the HEXXH zinc-binding motif (HELTH), which is likely to be essential for its enzymatic activity. In a number of metallopeptidases including ECE-1 and NEP, mutation of either histidine or the glutamic acid of this motif resulted in a totally inactive enzyme (see Ref. 1Turner A.J. Tanzawa K. FASEB J. 1997; 1: 355-364Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar and references therein). To disrupt XCE in vivo, the exon encoding the zinc-binding motif and the next two downstream exons were replaced with a neomycin resistance cassette (Fig. 1 A). A thymidine kinase gene was included at the 5′ end of the targeting vector as a negative selection marker against random integration. The targeting vector was electroporated into ES cells (derived from the 129/sv mouse strain), and clones resistant to G418 and gancyclovir were screened for homologous recombination events by Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and probed with a XCE gene fragment external to the targeting vector. The wild-type XCE allele gave an approximately 9-kb band, while the targeted allele resulted in a 3.3-kb fragment (Fig. 1 B). The correct targeting event was detected in 25 out of 100 ES cell clones that were screened. Recombinant ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts, and resulting male chimeras were bred to C57BL/6 females. Germline transmission of the disrupted allele resulted in heterozygous mice that developed normally, were fertile, and showed no obvious abnormalities. To determine the effect of the targeted XCE allele in the homozygous state, heterozygous mice were intercrossed and the offspring were genotyped by Southern and PCR analysis. No viable homozygotes (XCE −/−) were found when 310 offspring were analyzed at 1–2 weeks of age (Table I). The ratio of wild-type to heterozygous progeny was approximately 1:2 (Table I). These findings indicate that XCE is an essential gene, disruption of which results in perinatal death.Table IGenotypes of the progeny from XCE (+/−) intercrossesAgeNo. of pupsGenotype+/++/−−/−Knock-outaXCE −/− (knock-out) mice calculated as the percentage of all genotyped mice in the same age group.%18.5 dpc174437853301–2 weeks dpp3109221800Genomic DNA was extracted from the tails of E18.5 embryos or neonates (1–2 weeks dpp) and then subjected to PCR analysis to determine the genotype. dpp, days post partum; dpc, days post coitum.a XCE −/− (knock-out) mice calculated as the percentage of all genotyped mice in the same age group.

To investigate the lethality of XCE −/− homozygotes, we performed timed matings of heterozygotes and analyzed embryos of various gestational age. At 18.5 days post coitum, 53 out of 174 offspring were viable XCE −/− homozygotes with beating hearts (Table I). Fig.1 C shows the genotypes of a representative litter, which were determined by PCR using the primers shown in Fig. 1 A. The number of homozygous mice (30%) was close to the expected Mendelian frequency, indicating that the XCE knock-out did not cause intrauterine death during development. No significant difference in size or overall appearance could be detected between E18.5 XCE −/− embryos and their wild-type and heterozygous littermates. The sex ratio of wild-type and XCE −/− fetuses was also comparable. To confirm complete inactivation of the XCE gene, XCE expression was examined by RT-PCR. As expected, RT-PCR revealed no expression of the XCE gene in homozygous E18.5 XCE −/− embryos (Fig.1 D). At birth all XCE −/− pups displayed the same striking characteristics. The newborn homozygotes could open their mouths but remained cyanotic and died of anoxia within 10–30 min. It is important to note that none of the XCE −/− homozygotes survived beyond this very early neonatal stage. The breathing problems were not due to an occlusion of the trachea, as demonstrated by probing of several embryos. Examination of their lungs, however, indicated that the vast majority were never ventilated. Taken together, these results demonstrate that XCE −/− homozygous mice die shortly after birth from impaired breathing and suggest that XCE may be important in the control of respiration. Given the normal gross appearance of E18.5 XCE −/− embryos and XCE −/− newborn, we next performed a thorough visceral examination of 57 E18.5 embryos (18 −/−) derived from 6 intercrosses of heterozygotes as well as of 20 newborn pups (11 −/−). Although we observed some anomalies that occurred in wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/−), and homozygous (−/−) animals at about the same frequency, the study did not reveal any anatomical malformations specific for the XCE knock-out. As an example, a comparison of the great vessels from XCE-deficient and wild-type mice is shown in Fig.2 (A and B). To study the skeleton in the XCE knock-out animals, embryos from 7 litters obtained by C-section on day 18.5 (21 −/−) were analyzed and stained with Alizarin Red S. The skeletal and cartilage components of XCE −/− embryos did not show any abnormal characteristics that are related to the gene targeting (Table II). The examination revealed some retardations and variations that were, however, present in wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous fetuses at about the same incidence, indicating that they are typical for the strain of mouse. The only remarkable skeletal malformations, which were detected, affect the sternum and also occurred with comparable frequency in wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous embryos. It is worth noting that our skeletal analysis did also not detect any craniofacial abnormalities, such as the fusion of the thyroid cartilage, hyoid bone, and basisphenoid bone, which could contribute to the respiratory failure in XCE −/− homozygotes (Fig. 2, Cand D).Table IISummary of skeletal anomaliesNo. of +/+No. of +/−No. of −/−Fetuses (E18.5)/litters16 /731 /721 /7Alive/dead16 /031 /021 /0Male/female7 /9aNot all fetuses could be sexed.15 /13aNot all fetuses could be sexed.10 /6aNot all fetuses could be sexed.Fetuses with retardationsIncompletely ossified bones or unossified bones112213Fetuses with variationsExtra cervical rib81610Thoracic rib 13 rudimentary100Fetuses with abnormalitiesLumbar vertebra missing100Sternal elements misshapen, fused, or misaligned61212Abnormality, permanent structural change which may adversely affect survival, development, or function; variation, deviation beyond the normal range of structural constitution, but which may not adversely affect survival, development or function; retardation, structure which has not developed fully corresponding to its chronological age.a Not all fetuses could be sexed.

To further characterize the XCE −/− animals, a histopathological evaluation of all major organs was performed. The examination of lungs obtained from several litters confirmed that the vast majority of lungs from XCE −/− mice remained atelectatic after birth (Fig.3). Congenital atelectasis was found in 15/20 homozygous animals analyzed. From the five non-atelectatic lungs, three were only minimally aerated. In contrast, the lungs of XCE +/+ mice were all properly inflated. Besides the atelectasis, the lung structures of the XCE −/− animals did not show any obvious anomalies when compared with their wild-type littermates. As mentioned above, XCE mRNA is preferentially expressed in the CNS where medulla, spinal chord, putamen, and subthalamic nucleus show highest levels of expression. This tissue distribution, together with the early respiratory failure of XCE −/− animals, prompted us to study the CNS and especially the brain stem region with the medulla oblongata, known to be of importance in the regulation of vegetative functions, such as respiration, in more detail. To this end, serial sections of the brainstem were prepared and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and cresyl fast violet (Nissl). The histopathological examination did not reveal any obvious differences between XCE −/− and wild-type control animals. In particular, no changes in morphology and distribution of neuronal cells were detected in the medulla oblongata of XCE −/− mice (Fig. 4). Differences between mutant and wild-type animals were also not found in the other regions of the CNS including spinal chord and putamen. In addition, the histological analysis did not detect apparent abnormalities in any other organs, such as heart, kidney, liver, eyes, intestine, and trachea. To extent the analysis of the XCE-deficient mice, we first compared the heart beat frequency of wild-type and XCE mutant embryos. No significant differences in the mean heart rate were detected between XCE +/+ (87 ± 14 bpm), XCE +/− (83 ± 12 bpm), and XCE −/− (81 ± 9 bpm) mice, indicating that the presence of XCE is not important for a normal heart beat frequency. Postnatal respiratory failure can be due to a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant proteins (21Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 22Tokieda K. Whitsett J.A. Clark J.C. Weaver T.E. Ikeda K. McConnell K.B. Jobe A.H. Ikegami M. Iwamoto H.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L875-L882PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this is the case in XCE knock-out animals, the expression of the surfactant-associated proteins SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D was examined in lungs of wild-type and XCE −/− E18.5 mice. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed very similar mRNA levels of each of the four surfactant-associated proteins in XCE +/+ and XCE −/− animals (Fig.5). When the results of several experiments were quantitated, the expression in XCE-deficient mice was found to be 111 ± 11% of the wild-type level for SP-A, 92 ± 8% for SP-B, 97 ± 10% for SP-C, and 102 ± 7% for SP-D. Thus, the loss of XCE function does not cause a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant proteins. In the present study, we disrupted the XCE gene in mouse ES cells by gene targeting and established mice bearing the mutant XCE allele. The resulting phenotype is characterized by neonatal lethality of 100% of the XCE −/− homozygotes, demonstrating for the first time that XCE has a critical, non-redundant function. The cause of death in the XCE-deficient animals appears to be anoxia due to respiratory failure. While observing female mice giving birth, we found that homozygous mutant neonates were born alive but died shortly thereafter. In contrast to their wild-type and heterozygous littermates, which turned pink within minutes, all XCE −/− newborns remained cyanotic. An examination of their lungs revealed that the vast majority were never ventilated. Other than atelectasis, no detectable pathological changes in the lung structures of XCE −/− mice were observed in histological sections, demonstrating that the respiratory distress is not intrinsic to this organ. The absence of obvious craniofacial abnormalities affecting the upper airway or mouth, the lack of thoracic malformations, as well as the absence of a tracheal occlusion or a fusion between craniofacial bones and the trachea indicate that the respiratory failure after birth is most likely not caused by mechanical obstruction. Another possible reason for impaired breathing can be the reduced production of surfactant proteins, a family of polypeptides in pulmonary alveoli implicated in lung function. Similar to the phenotype of XCE −/− mice, disruption of the surfactant protein B gene resulted in lethal postnatal respiratory distress associated with atelectasis (21Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 22Tokieda K. Whitsett J.A.

However, no significant differences in the expression of the surfactant-associated proteins SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D were found between XCE +/+ and XCE −/− mice, indicating that a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant proteins is not the cause for the respiratory failure in XCE −/− animals. The same was true for the Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10), another pulmonary differentiation marker. 2A. Schweizer and J. Rohrer, unpublished data. The respiratory distress appears also not to be the result of cardiac problems since no anomalies of the heart or great vessels were found. Furthermore, the heart beat frequency was not significantly affected in XCE −/− mice. Thus, a dysfunction in the central respiratory control becomes a likely possibility for the observed lethality of the XCE −/− newborns. Spontaneous automatic respiration is controlled by the respiratory center in the medulla and transmitted via the spinal chord to motor neurons that control the respiratory muscles. In the rat, for example, phasic respiratory neurons have been located in the ventrolateral part of the medulla oblongata (23Bystrzycka E.K. Nail B.S. Paxinos G. The Rat Nervous System. Academic Press Australia, Sydney1985: 95-110Google Scholar). This is particularly intriguing since the medulla and the spinal chord were among the tissues with the highest expression levels for the XCE mRNA, which is preferentially expressed in the CNS (2Valdenaire O. Richards J.G. Faull R.L.M. Schweizer A. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although we did not detect obvious abnormalities in the formation of the medulla oblongata or other structures of the CNS in XCE −/− mice by our histopathological examination, the possibility that subtle defects within these structures underlie the loss of vital functions will have to be investigated. For example, these may involve synaptic connections or transmission. The latter possibility is especially attractive since the specific neuronal expression pattern of XCE together with the fact that it belongs to a metallopeptidase family suggests that it may be involved in the maturation of one or several neuropeptide transmitters (2Valdenaire O. Richards J.G. Faull R.L.M. Schweizer A. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the lethality of the XCE −/− animals, that we consider, however, less likely, are abnormalities in the respiratory muscles themselves, in particular the muscles of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. Targeted disruption has previously been reported for other members of the NEP/ECE zinc metallopeptidase family. No developmental abnormalities have been detected in ECE-2-deficient mice (24.Yanagisawa, M. (1997) 5th International Conference on Endothelins, Sept. 12–15, 1997, Kyoto, Japan, Abstr. O-21.Google Scholar). Mice lacking NEP also appeared developmentally normal except for some minor differences in lymphoid development. However, a strongly enhanced susceptibility to endotoxin shock was observed (25Lu B. Gerard N.P. Kolakowski L.F. Bozza M. Zurakowski D. Finco O. Carrol M.C. Gerard C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2271-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). ECE-1 null mice, on the other hand, showed a lethal phenotype (26Yanagisawa H. Yanagisawa M. Kapur R.P. Richardson J.A. Williams S.C. Clouthier D.E. de Wit D. Emoto N. Hammer R.E. Development. 1998; 125: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 75% of the ECE-1 −/− embryos died in utero, and the ECE-1 −/− term embryos all died within 30 min of birth from impaired breathing. The ECE-1 −/− mice exhibited severe craniofacial and cardiac abnormalities comparable to the defects seen in ET-1 −/− (27Kurihara Y. Kurihara H. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Maemura K. Nagai R. Oda H.

In addition, enteric neurons and epidermal melanocytes are absent in the ECE-1-deficient embryos, recapitulating the developmental changes found in endothelin receptor B (ETB) −/− (29Hosoda K.

Although XCE −/− homozygous animals share the respiratory failure with the ECE-1 −/−, ET-1 −/−, and ETA −/− mice, we did not detect any of the neural crest-related malformations seen in these animals. For example, none of the craniofacial abnormalities that could narrow the upper airway were found. The observed differences in the phenotypes between XCE −/− mice and knock-out animals of the major proteins of the endothelin system support our recent evidence that XCE does not appear to play a role in this system (2Valdenaire O. Richards J.G. Faull R.L.M. Schweizer A. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the generation of XCE null mice has given insight into the physiological importance of XCE. The disruption of XCE in mice has proven to be incompatible with life after birth. Although further investigations are clearly necessary to precise the exact mechanism of the lethality, our results suggest that XCE may play an essential role in the regulation of the respiratory system.

Wieloch T. Reivich M. Hurtig H. Cerebrovascular Diseases. Raven Press, New York1983: 251-274Google Scholar, 23Fishman R.A. Chen P.H. Trans. Am. Neurol. Assoc. 1981; 106: 58-61PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a free radical pathway oxidizes AA-PC directly to produce phospholipid endoperoxides (24Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

We previously showed that LGE2-protein adducts are also produced during free radical-induced oxidation of LDL (27Salomon R.G. Subbanagounder G. Singh U. O'Neil J. Hoff H.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). While the enzymatic pathway generates a single stereoisomer with trans disposed side chains, peroxy radical cyclization generates an isomeric mixture in which stereoisomers with cis disposed side chains predominate (28Porter N.A. Funk M.O. J. Org. Chem. 1975; 40: 3614-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as, for example, in the 2-lysophosphatidylcholine (PC) ester 8-epi-PGH2-PC (Fig. 1). Rearrangement of 8-epi-PGH2-PC would deliver 8-epi-LGE2-PC. However, because the stereocenters at positions 8 and 9 are lost during Paal-Knorr condensation (29Jackson A.H. Barton D. Ollis D.W. Comprehensive Organic Chemistry. 4. Pergamon Press, New York1980: 275-320Google Scholar) of this LG-phospholipid with lysyl amino groups of LDL protein, formation of a pyrrole adduct in conjunction with enzyme-catalyzed hydrolytic release of lysophosphatidylcholine (30Steinbrecher U.P.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) generates the same LGE2-pyrrole as that formed by the cyclooxygenase pathway (Fig. 1).Mouse peritoneal macrophages internalize and degrade LGE2-LDL if the molar ratio of LGE2 to LDL protein (apoB) exceeds a threshold somewhere between 10:1 and 38:1 by a receptor mediated uptake that is completely inhibited by oxLDL (8Hoppe G. Subbanagounder G. O'Neil J. Salomon R.G. Hoff H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, uptake of oxLDL is inhibited by LGE2-LDL, supporting the conclusion that both LGE2-LDL and oxLDL are recognized by the same receptor. However, the ratio of LGE2to apoB in oxLDL does not exceed 2:1. Nevertheless, the total modification of apoB by all of the isomeric levulinaldehyde derivatives produced by oxidation of AA might suffice to account for receptor recognition, uptake, and inefficient processing of oxLDL. Thus, because hydrogen atom abstraction readily occurs nonregioselectively at any doubly allylic methylene, we postulated that the free radical pathway not only can produce a stereoisomeric mixture of levulinaldehyde derivatives with PG side chains, i.e. iso-LGs, but also structurally isomeric levulinaldehyde derivatives with nonprostanoid side chains, i.e. iso[n]LGs. For example, hydrogen atom abstraction from the 10-position of AA-PC followed by cyclization of an intermediate 8-peroxyeicosatetraenoyl radical could lead to iso[4]PGH2-PC and then iso[4]LGE2-PC (Fig. 1), where the number in brackets signifies the length of the carboxylic side chain appended to a common 2,3-dioxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane or levulinaldehyde core. The generation of phospholipid endoperoxides that are structural isomers of PGH2 by free radical-induced oxidation was postulated previously to account for the formation of isoprostanes (24Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar, 25Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Thus, iso[4]PGH2-PC (12-H2-IsoP) is also the putative precursor of isoprostanes that have been designated 12-F2-IsoP, 12-E2-IsoP, and 12-D2-IsoP (33.Taber, D. F., Morrow, J. D., and Roberts, L. J., II (1997) 53, 63–67.Google Scholar). In analogy with the chemistry of LGE2, we expected that iso[4]LGE2-PC would form iso[4]LGE2-pyrrole by covalent adduction to proteins and concomitant phospholipolysis (Fig.1). We now report confirmation of this hypothesis. Thus, the generation of iso[4]LGE2-protein epitopes during in vitro nonenzymatic free radical-induced oxidation of LDL was detected with an immunoassay using antibodies raised against an iso[4]LGE2-protein adduct. Since iso[4]LGE2 is formed by the isoprostane pathway but not by the COX pathway, the new antibody allows unambiguous assessment of the formation of iso-LGs from the isoprostane pathway.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we report mass spectral characterization of the covalent iso-LG-derived protein modifications that are generated during free-radical induced oxidation of LDL.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral MethodsCentrifugation was done on a Sorvall centrifuge at 5 °C and 2000 rpm.

The solution was then dialyzed against PBS (3 × 1 liters over 60 h) at room temperature. After dialysis, the final volume of the solution was adjusted to 5 ml. The final protein concentration, 1.25 mg/ml, was determined by the Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (39Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

The amount of LGE2 bound to HSA or BSA was determined by quantitative radiochemical analysis. The data for the standards (Fig. 2) fits the equation: [pyrrole (μmol)] = 2.22 (absorbance at 586 nm). The absorption maximum (λmax) for LGE2-HSA-derived and iso[4]LGE2-BSA-derived Ehrlich pyrrole assay chromophores were 586 and 584 nm, respectively. The concentration of pyrrole was presumed to be equal to the concentration of LGE2 that is bound to BSA or HSA. This assumes a quantitative yield of protein-bound LGE2-derived pyrrole. Thus, the concentration of pyrrole estimated by Ehrlich assay is an upper limit for protein-bound iso[4]LGE2-derived pyrrole. The pyrrole concentration in the iso[4]LGE2-KLH solution is 0.52 mmKLH-bound iso[4]LGE2.Figure 2The correlation between LGE2-bound to absorbance at 586 nm for the Ehrlich pyrrole assay, using DMAB and HCl, of LGE2-protein adducts: LGE2-BSA (●) and LGE2-HSA (■).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Iso[4]LGE2-BSA Coating AgentA PBS solution containing 4.54 mmiso[4]LGE2 (1.6 mg, 4.54 μmol) and 0.2 mmBSA (13.2 mg, 11.7 μmol of lysyl residues) was incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The solution was then dialyzed against PBS (4 × 500 ml) over 48 h at room temperature. After dialysis, the final volume of the solution was adjusted to 6 ml. The final protein concentration, determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay as described above, was 1.85 mg/ml. The pyrrole concentration, 0.59 mm BSA-bound iso[4]LGE2, was determined by an Ehrlich assay using LGE2-BSA and LGE2-HSA as standards.Iso[4]LGE2-HSA StandardA PBS solution containing 3.55 mmiso[4]LGE2 (2.5 mg, 7.10 μmol) and 0.16 mmHSA (20.6 mg, 18.30 μmol of lysyl residues) was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The solution was then dialyzed against PBS (3 × 1 liters) for 48 h at room temperature. The final volume of the solution was adjusted to 10 ml. The final protein concentration, determined using Pierce BCA protein assay as described above, was 1.81 mg/ml. The pyrrole concentration, 0.52 mm HSA-bound iso[4]LGE2, was determined by Ehrlich assay using LGE2-BSA and LGE2-HSA as standards.ImmunizationThe immunogen, iso[4]LGE2-KLH (5.0 mg) containing 0.75 μmol of iso[4]LGE2 per mg of KLH, was diluted to 5 ml with pH 7.4 PBS. An aliquot (500 μl) was emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant (500 μl). Each of two Pasturella free, New Zealand White rabbits (Hazelton) were inoculated intradermally into several sites on the back (200 μl) and rear leg (200 μl). Booster injections of iso[4]LGE2-KLH with Freund's incomplete adjuvant were given every 21 days. Antibody titer was monitored 10 days after each inoculation by ELISA as described below.Antibody PurificationThe iso[4]LGE2-KLH immune serum from the 73 day bleeding of rabbit 1, containing 34.4 mg/ml protein, as determined by absorbance at 280 nm (A 280 = 1.35 for 1.0 mg/ml), was purified using a protein G column as described previously (21Salomon R.G.

The resulting antibody solution (8.75 ml) contained 1.47 mg/ml purified IgGs. This corresponded to 13.3% of the total protein in the immune serum.ELISAFor all ELISAs, unless otherwise noted, duplicates of each sample were run on the same plate.Antibody TitersFor determination of antibody levels in rabbit blood serum, iso[4]LGE2-BSA containing 10 mol of pyrrole/mol of protein, was used as coating agent. The iso[4]LGE2-BSA conjugate (100 μl of a solution containing 4.4 mg/ml in pH 7.4 PBS) was added to each well of a sterilized Baxter ELISA plate. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a moist chamber. After discarding the coating solution, each well was washed with PBS (3 × 300 μl), then filled with 1.0% CEO in PBS (300 μl), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to block remaining active sites on the plastic phase. Each well was washed with 0.1% CEO in PBS (300 μL) and then 100 μl of rabbit serum from each bleeding diluted 1:10,000 with 0.2% CEO in PBS, or 0.2% CEO in PBS without serum for a blank, was dispensed into the sample wells. Normal rabbit, i.e. prior to inoculation with antigen, serum diluted as above was employed as a negative response control. The ELISA was completed as described previously (21Salomon R.G.

The antibody titer rose abruptly after 3 weeks, reaching a plateau within about 30 days (Fig.3).Figure 3Antibody titer against iso[4]LGE2-KLH (1:10,000 dilution).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Competitive Antibody Binding Inhibition StudiesFor antibody binding inhibition studies to measure cross-reactivities, an iso[4]LGE2-BSA adduct was used as coating agent and iso[4]LGE2-HSA was used as a standard. On each ELISA plate, a blank, a positive control containing no inhibitor, and up to 10 serial dilutions of each inhibitor and the iso[4]LGE2-HSA standard were run. The standard was prepared by diluting a 1.04 mm HSA-bound iso[4]LGE2 solution in PBS to 104 μm with pH 7.4 PBS. A serial dilution of factor 0.2 was used. Each well of the plate was coated with iso[4]LGE2-BSA solution (100 μl), prepared by diluting a solution containing 1.08 mmBSA-bound iso[4]LGE2 in PBS to 432 nm with pH 7.4 PBS. The plate was covered with a plastic lid and placed in incubator at 37 °C for 1 h, and then allowed to come to room temperature. After discarding the supernatant, each well was washed with pH 7.4 PBS (3 × 300 μl) and then blocked by incubating 1 h at 37 °C with 300 μl of 1% CEO in pH 7.4 PBS. After coming to room temperature, the supernatant was discarded and the wells rinsed with 0.1% CEO in pH 7.4 PBS (300 μl). For each sample and the iso[4]LGE2-HSA standard, the undiluted sample solution (150 μl) and aliquots (150 μl) of up to nine 1:10 serial dilutions with 5 mm pH 7.4 PBS were incubated in test tubes at 37 °C for 1 h with antibody solution (150 μl) that was prepared by adding the required amount of protein G column purified antibody (0.294 μg/ml) in pH 7.4 PBS to 0.2% CEO in pH 7.4 PBS (2.8 μl/14 ml of 2% CEO). The remaining ELISA procedure and similar antibody binding inhibition studies with LGE2-KLH antibody, LGE2-BSA adduct as coating agent, and LGE2-HSA as standard were performed as described previously (21Salomon R.G.

The mixture was applied to a C18 SepPak cartridge (Waters) that had been preconditioned with methanol (5 ml) and water (10 ml). The SepPak was washed with heptane (10 ml) and heptane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v, 10 ml) before elution with methanol/ethyl acetate (2:3, v/v, 10 ml). The eluate was dried, resuspended in 10% aqueous methanol, and subjected to HPLC (4.6 × 250 mm Macrosphere 300 C18 column from Alltech; 10 min in 0.1% aqueous acetic acid, then 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous acetic acid; 1 ml/min). Fractions (1 ml) were collected and aliquots subjected to scintillation counting. Aliquots of fractions exhibiting UV absorbance at 205 nm (Fig. 4 A) and containing radioactivity, which indicates the incorporation of lysine, were assessed by LC/MS (Fig. 4, B and C) by direct infusion using a Finnigan TSQ7000 spectrometer with the sheath gas held at 70 p.s.i., auxiliary gas at 10 p.s.i., and with 25 volts on the capillary, a capillary temperature of 220 °C, and the tube lens voltage at 90 V. Fractions deemed to contain only compounds with the molecular ion of the lactam (m/z 479.4) or hydroxylactam (m/z 495.4) adducts and were combined. None of these fractions contained detectable amounts of the LGE2-derived pyrrole which would show [MH]+ = 463, [M + H − H2O]+ = 445, or [M + Na]+ = 485. The resulting mixture of lactam and hydroxylactam adducts was again analyzed by LC/MS, revealing no contamination by compounds with the molecular ion of the pyrrole adduct (m/z 463). The putative lactam and hydroxylactam adducts were also subjected to collision-induced dissociation, which resulted in fragmentation patterns consistent with the structures assigned to the compounds (19Brame C.J.

A sample containing 50 ng each of LGE2-lysine lactam and hydroxylactam was dissolved in PBS/EtOH (75 μl, 4:1, v/v) to give 140 pmol/well as final concentration. LGE2-BSA was used as coating agent and LGE2-HSA was used as standard to measure cross-reactivity. The ELISA was done as under “Competitive Antibody Binding Inhibition Studies.”Figure 4Analysis of LGE2-lysine lactam and hydroxylactam adducts.

This study provided evidence for the functional importance of Src kinases in regulating the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. Three Src class kinases, Fyn, Fyk, and Src, each formed a complex with the endplate-specific cytoskeletal protein rapsyn. In addition, cellular phosphorylation by each kinase was stimulated by rapsyn in heterologous transfected cells. Several lines of evidence supported rapsyn as a substrate for Src kinases. Most importantly, rapsyn regulation of Fyn, Fyk, and Src resulted in phosphorylation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor β and δ subunits and anchoring of the receptor to the cytoskeleton. Both nicotinic acetylcholine receptor phosphorylation and cytoskeletal anchoring were blocked by the Src kinase-selective inhibitor herbimycin A. Rapsyn alone also induced a modest increase in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor phosphorylation and cytoskeletal translocation. However, inhibition by herbimycin A and a catalytically inactive dominant negative Src demonstrated that the effects of rapsyn were mediated by endogenous Src kinases. These data support the importance of Src class kinases for stabilization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the endplate during synaptic differentiation at the neuromuscular junction.

Synaptic transmission is a precise but dynamic function mediated by a unique subcellular structure containing specialized proteins. A fundamental question in neurobiology is what are the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptogenesis. Historically, the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle has provided a system in which to identify the specialized proteins, characterize their function, and begin to determine how the synapse is formed (for a review, see Ref. 1Hall Z.W. Sanes J.R. Cell/Neuron. 1993; 72/10 (suppl.): 99-121Google Scholar). A crucial process during synaptogenesis is the recruitment of postsynaptic elements to the developing endplate.

Thus, agrin and its receptor MuSK are important for initiating AChR clustering in response to the motor neuron. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(s) Bruton's tyrosine kinase C-terminal anti-pan-Src class kinase antibody pBK-CMVΔlac Src homology 2 and 3, respectively c-Src MuSK, muscle-specific kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(s) Bruton's tyrosine kinase C-terminal anti-pan-Src class kinase antibody pBK-CMVΔlac Src homology 2 and 3, respectively c-Src MuSK, muscle-specific kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Rapsyn is an intracellular peripheral membrane protein crucial for postsynaptic localization of the AChR. Rapsyn is expressed in a one-to-one ratio with the AChR (6La Rochelle W.J. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5270-5274PubMed Google Scholar), can be cross-linked to the receptor (7Burden S.J. DePalma R.L. Gottesman G.S. Cell. 1983; 35: 687-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and is precisely colocalized with the AChR from the earliest times of cluster formation (8Noakes P.G. Phillips W.D. Hanley T.A. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Expression of rapsyn with the AChR in nonmuscle cells is sufficient to induce receptor clustering (9Phillips W.D. Maimone M.M. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 52Froehner S.C. Luetje C.W. Scotland P.B. Patrick J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,53Yu X.M. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 785-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, rapsyn is necessary for AChR clustering as demonstrated by targeted disruption of the Rapsyn gene; mice lacking rapsyn die soon after birth, and the cultured myotubes from these mice do not form either spontaneous or agrin-induced AChR clusters (10Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Complementing its effect on clustering, several lines of evidence suggest that rapsyn forms a cytoskeletal anchor for the AChR. Extraction of rapsyn from the postsynaptic membrane increases the rotational mobility of the AChR (11Barrantes F.J. Neugebauer D.C. Zingshein H.P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 112: 72-78Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, rapsyn is an actin-binding protein (12Walker J.H. Boustead C.M. Witzemann V. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2287-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and cotransfection of rapsyn with the AChR increases linkage of the receptor to the cytoskeleton (13Phillips W.D. Noakes P.G. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, rapsyn has been shown to induce coclustering of the AChR with dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex that functions as a transmembrane link between the extracellular matrix and the intracellular cytoskeleton in muscle (14Apel E.D. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In addition, rapsyn is in close association with dystroglycan as demonstrated by chemical cross-linking (15Cartaud A. Coutant S. Petrucci T.C. Cartaud J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11321-11326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, rapsyn appears to mediate both AChR clustering and anchoring of the receptor to the cytoskeleton. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation has been increasingly implicated as an important intracellular signaling mechanism for modulating synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Postsynaptically, protein tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the AChR in three independent ways. First, the AChR itself is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and this phosphorylation regulates the kinetics of receptor desensitization (16Hopfield J.F. Tank D.W. Greengard P. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1988; 336: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Second, a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, ErbB, mediates synapse-specific transcription of the AChR (17Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Third, phosphorylation of the AChR and/or other postsynaptic proteins on tyrosine residues appears to be important for receptor aggregation during synaptogenesis. Numerous lines of evidence indicate that protein tyrosine phosphorylation is critical for AChR clustering and cytoskeletal anchoring at the endplate. The AChR of innervated myotubes is both phosphorylated and clustered, while receptor from noninnervated myotubes is neither phosphorylated nor clustered (18Qu Z.C. Moritz E. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1990; 4: 367-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Qu Z. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6834-6841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Smith M.M. Merlie J.P. Lawrence J.C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1987; 84: 6601-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Agrin stimulates AChR phosphorylation as well as clustering (19Qu Z. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6834-6841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wallace B.G. Qu Z. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1991; 6: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The agrin-induced phosphorylation precedes AChR clustering, and protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors block both phosphorylation and clustering, consistent with a causal relationship (21Wallace B.G. Qu Z. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1991; 6: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Ferns M. Deiner M. Hall Z. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, MuSK, a component of the agrin receptor, is a protein-tyrosine kinase (5Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattson K. Burden S.J. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of MuSK with rapsyn activates MuSK, resulting in AChR phosphorylation (24Gillespie S.K. Balasubramanian S. Fung E.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and MuSK has been shown to form a complex with AChR (25Fuhrer C. Sugiyama J.E. Taylor R.G. Hall Z.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4951-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice with a disruption of the gene encoding MuSK do not form neuromuscular synapses (26DeChiara T. Bowen D.C. Valenzuela D.M. Simmons M.V. Poueyirou W.T. Thomas S. Kinetz E. Compton D.L. Rojas E. Park J.S. Smith C. DiStefano P.S. Glass D.J. Burden S.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In addition to clustering, AChR stabilization at the endplate also appears to involve tyrosine phosphorylation. Agrin-induced cytoskeletal anchoring of the receptor shows a close temporal correlation with phosphorylation, and increasing AChR phosphorylation with a phosphatase inhibitor results in cytoskeletal association (27Wallace B.G. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Meier T. Perez G.M. Wallace G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a kinase inhibitor that blocks agrin-induced AChR tyrosine phosphorylation also inhibits cytoskeletal anchoring of the receptor (22Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These studies support the importance of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in AChR localization to the endplate; however, the precise mechanism by which phosphorylation is involved is still unclear. We have identified two Src class protein-tyrosine kinases, Fyn and Fyk, that may participate in the signal transduction cascade regulating the AChR (30Swope S.L. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25152-25161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Swope S.L. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29817-29824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, Fyn and Fyk comprise the predominant protein-tyrosine kinase activity in the AChR-enriched Torpedo californica electric organ postsynaptic membranes, a biochemical model of the neuromuscular junction endplate (30Swope S.L. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25152-25161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fyn and Fyk form a complex with the AChR and can directly phosphorylate the receptorin vitro (30Swope S.L. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25152-25161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The association of the receptor with the two kinases is mediated by a high affinity binding of the tyrosine-phosphorylated AChR δ subunit to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the kinases (31Swope S.L. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29817-29824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Others have shown that in the C2C12 mouse muscle cell line, the AChR is associated with Fyn and c-Src (Src) and that an AChR β subunit fusion protein can be phosphorylated by Src (32Fuhrer C. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32474-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Src family protein-tyrosine kinases may phosphorylate and regulate the AChR in vivo. In both neuronal and nonneuronal systems, Src family kinases have been implicated in cytoskeletal function (33Helmke S. Pfenninger K.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 194-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Inamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In this study, we have begun to investigate how Src class kinases fit into the signal transduction cascade by which the AChR is regulated. We have tested the ability of Fyn, Fyk, and Src to be regulated by rapsyn, to phosphorylate the AChR and rapsyn, and to induce anchoring of the receptor to the cytoskeleton (64.Mohamed, A.

(Santa Cruz, CA). The Q-F18 cell line expressing high levels of the mouse fetal AChR, a gift from Dr. J. H Steinbach, was maintained as described (39Chen Q. Fletcher G.H. Steinbach J.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cultures at about 50% confluence were transfected using the CaPO4 precipitation method (40Chen D. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 20 μg/100-mm dish of total plasmid DNA; 10 μg of each construct was used and supplemented, if necessary, with empty pBK-CMV. Using the Green Lantern vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), transfection efficiency was determined to be ≥50%. In some experiments, cells were transfected in the presence of 1 μm herbimycin A or Me2SO carrier. The protein concentration per plate was not affected by expression of Src family kinases, rapsyn, or herbimycin A (data not shown). Homogenate and postsynaptic membranes of Torpedo electric organ were prepared by methods we have previously described (30Swope S.L. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25152-25161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected Q-F18 cells or aliquots of Torpedo electric organ fractions were solubilized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm NaVO4 (lysis buffer) without or with 1% deoxycholate and 0.1% or 0.2% SDS for 20 min on ice (30Swope S.L. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25152-25161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of in vivo rapsyn phosphorylation,Torpedo electric organ homogenate was solubilized in lysis buffer without Triton X-100 but containing 2% SDS, treated with or without boiling for 3 min, diluted in lysis buffer to a final concentration of 0.4% SDS and 2% Triton X-100 at 1 mg/ml protein, and sonicated twice for 15 s. In each case, lysates were spun at 225,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatant proteins were immunoprecipitated as described (30Swope S.L. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25152-25161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for coprecipitated proteins by immunoblotting. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore Corp.) by electroblotting. The polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were blocked in Blotto (Pierce). Primary antibodies were used in the following dilutions: anti-rapsyn monoclonal antibody (1234A) ascites, anti-AChR γ and δ subunit (88b) crude serum, affinity-purified anti-Src (Src-CT) antibody, phosphorylation-specific anti-AChR β subunit serum (JH1360), anti-AChR δ subunit serum (JH1358), and anti-AChR α subunit ascites (number 109) each at 1:1000. Antiphosphotyrosine (4G10) monoclonal antibody was used at 1:5000. Secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used at dilutions of 1:5000. Horseradish peroxidase-bound signal was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence followed by exposure to BioMax MR-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For some experiments, blots were stripped by incubation at 55 °C for 30 min in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and reanalyzed by Western blotting. Densitometry scanning was performed on a Howtek Scanner using PDI Discovery Series software at the Lombardi Cancer Center's Macromolecular Synthesis and Sequencing Shared Resource. The AChR was purified from confluent transfected cells essentially as described previously (24Gillespie S.K. Balasubramanian S. Fung E.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using acetylcholine-Sepharose affinity resin (41Reynolds J.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2305-2308Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In short, cells were scraped into buffer containing 20 mmKPO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 units/ml trasylol, 20 mm benzamidine, 1 mmsodium vanadate, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were diluted into an equal volume of the above buffer containing 100 mm NaF and 20 mm iodoacetamide and used for purification of AChR. In some experiments, the concentration of Triton X-100 was 2%, as originally described (24Gillespie S.K. Balasubramanian S. Fung E.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Testing for insolubility in 1% Triton X-100 is a standard procedure for analyzing proteins localized to the cytoskeleton including Src family kinases and endplate components of the neuromuscular junction (24Gillespie S.K. Balasubramanian S. Fung E.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Helmke S. Pfenninger K.H. Cell Motil.

In this study, to examine cytoskeletal association of Src kinases and the AChR, Q-F18 cells were scraped into buffer containing 20 mmKPO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 units/ml trasylol, 20 mm benzamidine, 1 mmsodium vanadate, and 1% Triton X-100. Pellets remaining after centrifugation at 15,000 × g were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, sonicated for 30 s, and spun at 225,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were boiled for 3 min. The supernatants representing the Triton X-100 pellets subsequently solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer were analyzed by Western blotting. Q-F18 cells were scraped from the dish with lysis buffer, dispersed by vigorous pipetting, and mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer to a final concentration of 1×. The samples were sonicated for 30 s and spun at 225,000 × g for 20 min, and cellular proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Aliquots of Torpedopostsynaptic membranes protein were analyzed by the immune complex kinase assay as described (30Swope S.L. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25152-25161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For phosphoamino acid analysis,32P-labeled rapsyn was excised from polyacrylamide gels and processed as described (30Swope S.L. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25152-25161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry using bovine serum albumin as a standard (43Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A role for rapsyn in protein phosphorylation by Src family kinases was examined by testing whether Fyn, Fyk, and Src are regulated by rapsyn. First, association of rapsyn with Fyn and Fyk in Torpedoelectric organ postsynaptic membranes was examined. After solubilization of postsynaptic membranes under mild detergent conditions of 1% Triton X-100, rapsyn was isolated by immunoprecipitation, and the precipitate was tested for the presence of Src class kinases by Western blotting using an antibody that recognizes all members of the Src family. As shown in Fig.1 A, one or more Src class kinases was enriched in the rapsyn immunoprecipitate compared with the precipitation with empty protein G-Sepharose beads. Densitometry scanning analysis demonstrated that 0.4 ± 0.2% (mean ± S.E.; n = 4) of the postsynaptic Src class kinases were associated with rapsyn. Library screening as well as polymerase chain reaction analysis have indicated that Fyn and Fyk are the only Src class kinases expressed in Torpedo electric organ; Src itself does not appear to be expressed in this tissue. 2S. L. Swope, unpublished data. Thus, the data in Fig. 1 A indicated that rapsyn formed a complex with Fyn and/or Fyk in Torpedo electric organ. Specific complex formation between Fyn and Fyk was tested using the complementary approach. Fyn and Fyk were immunoprecipitated from electric organ postsynaptic membrane proteins solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, and the precipitates were analyzed for rapsyn. Rapsyn was detected in both the Fyn and Fyk but not the preimmune immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 B). Densitometry scanning analysis demonstrated that 0.14 ± 0.05% of the postsynaptic rapsyn was associated with Fyn, while 0.46 ± 0.09% was associated with Fyk under these conditions (mean ± S.E.; n = 5). With higher stringency solubilization buffer containing deoxycholate and SDS, coprecipitation of rapsyn with Fyn and Fyk was reduced (Fig.1 B). Thus, rapsyn forms a specific but apparently low affinity complex with Fyn and Fyk in Torpedo electric organ postsynaptic membranes. The specificity of complex formation between rapsyn and Src kinases was examined using the Q-F18 cell line as a heterologous transfection system. This system has been extensively utilized to dissect the molecular mechanism for rapsyn's role at the neuromuscular junction (9Phillips W.D. Maimone M.M. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Phillips W.D. Noakes P.G. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. J.

Science. 1991; 251: 568-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When Fyn, Fyk, or Src was expressed with rapsyn in the Q-F18 cell line, rapsyn coimmunoprecipitated with each of the kinases (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, rapsyn did not coimmunoprecipitate with coexpressed Btk, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase that contains SH2 and SH3 domains (45Tsukada S. Saffran D.C. Rawlings D.J. Parolini O.

https://openalex.org/W2051646566,"The unparalleled peroxisome-to-mitochondrion mistargeting of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) in the hereditary disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1 is caused by the combined presence of a common Pro11 → Leu polymorphism and a disease-specific Gly170 → Arg mutation. The Pro11 → Leu replacement generates a functionally weak N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), the efficiency of which is increased by the additional presence of the Gly170 → Arg replacement. AGT dimerization is inhibited in the combined presence of both replacements but not when each is present separately. In this paper we have attempted to identify the structural determinants of AGT dimerization and mitochondrial mistargeting. Unlike most MTSs, the polymorphic MTS of AGT has little tendency to adopt an α-helical conformationin vitro. Nevertheless, it is able to target efficiently a monomeric green fluorescent (GFP) fusion protein, but not dimeric AGT, to mitochondria in transfected COS-1 cells. Increasing the propensity of this MTS to fold into an α-helix, by making a double Pro11 → Leu + Pro10 → Leu replacement, enabled it to target both GFP and AGT efficiently to mitochondria. The double Pro11 → Leu + Pro10 → Leu replacement retarded AGT dimerization in vitro as did the disease-causing double Pro11 → Leu + Gly170→ Arg replacement. These data suggest that N-terminal α-helix formation is more important for maintaining AGT in a conformation (i.e. monomeric) compatible with mitochondrial import than it is for the provision of mitochondrial targeting information. The parallel effects of the Pro10 → Leu and Gly170 → Arg replacements on the dimerization and intracellular targeting of polymorphic AGT (containing the Pro11 → Leu replacement) raise the possibility that they might achieve their effects by the same mechanism.

Excessive oxalate synthesis leads to the chronic deposition of insoluble calcium oxalate mainly in the kidneys and urinary tract. Following renal failure, the problem of excessive oxalate synthesis is compounded by an inability to remove it from the body, and in such circumstances calcium oxalate can deposit almost anywhere in the body (2Danpure C.J.

Rumsby G. Khan S.R. Calcium Oxalate in Biological Systems. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 189-205Google Scholar). Disease in these patients is due to an unparalleled protein trafficking defect in which AGT is mistargeted to mitochondria where it is unable to fulfill its metabolic function of glyoxylate transamination/detoxification efficiently (4Danpure C.J. Cooper P.J. Wise P.J. Jennings P.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Mistargeting results from the combined presence of a common Pro11 → Leu polymorphism, which is present in normal North American and European populations with an allelic frequency of ∼20%, and a PH1-specific Gly170 → Arg mutation, which has a frequency of ∼0.05% (5Purdue P.E. Takada Y. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The Pro11 → Leu polymorphism was predicted to increase the likelihood of the N terminus of AGT folding into an amphiphilic α-helix typical of mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTSs). However, this polymorphic putative MTS appeared to be functionally weak and was not cleaved after import (5Purdue P.E. Takada Y. Danpure C.J. J.

Neither amino acid replacement has any direct effect of on the import of AGT into peroxisomes, to which normal AGT is targeted by a C-terminal non-consensus type 1 peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1) Lys-Lys-Leu (7Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R. De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131 (109): 95Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The explanation of how the Gly170 → Arg mutation can enhance the functional efficiency of the polymorphic MTS highlights one of the intriguing differences between the structural requirements for protein import into peroxisomes and mitochondria. Whereas at least some proteins, including AGT, can be imported into peroxisomes as fully folded oligomers (8Glover J.R. Andrews D.W. Rachubinski R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. 1979; 196: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that dimerizes rapidly and irreversibly after synthesis into a conformation incompatible with mitochondrial import but perfectly capable of being imported into peroxisomes (10Leiper J.M. Oatey P.B. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Neither Pro11 → Leu nor Gly170 → Arg on their own interfere with AGT dimerization to any significant extent, but when present together dimerization is retarded. It has been suggested that polymorphic AGT (i.e. that containing the Pro11 → Leu-generated MTS but not the Gly170 → Arg mutation) cannot be imported into mitochondria efficiently because it dimerizes faster than its commitment to mitochondrial import (10Leiper J.M. Oatey P.B. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, it continues to be targeted to peroxisomes as efficiently as normal AGT 2In the context of this paper, normal AGT refers to the protein encoded by the more common (major) AGXTallele with proline at residue 11, whereas polymorphic AGT refers to AGT encoded by the less common (minor) AGXT allele with leucine at this position. Both are, in fact, normal (2Danpure C.J. Purdue P.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131 (109): 95Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). When dimerization is blocked by the double Pro11 → Leu + Gly170→ Arg replacement, mitochondrial import is unimpeded and occurs at the expense of peroxisomal import, possibly because commitment to mitochondrial import precedes commitment to peroxisomal import (17Oatey P.B. Lumb M.J. Danpure C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). How AGT dimerization is retarded, apparently synergistically, by the double replacement and why the polymorphic MTS on its own is unable to retard dimerization are unknown. In the present study, we have attempted to address these issues. We have examined more closely the structural basis for the functional weakness of the polymorphic MTS of AGT and how the Gly170→ Arg mutation might be able to retard the dimerization of polymorphic but not normal AGT. Our investigations lead us to conclude that the polymorphic MTS of AGT is not intrinsically weak and that it contains all the necessary topogenic information required to target efficiently a monomeric protein to mitochondria in vivo. Its functional weakness seems to be due entirely to its inability to prevent AGT acquiring a conformation (i.e. dimeric) incompatible with mitochondrial import. This inadequacy is likely to stem from the inefficiency with which the N terminus of polymorphic AGT acquires an α-helical conformation typical of other MTSs. Our data lead us to speculate that the PH1-specific Gly170 → Arg mutation might increase the functional efficiency of the polymorphic MTS of AGT by providing a molecular environment within which its N terminus can fold more efficiently into an α-helix and thereby retard folding and/or dimerization. Three 21-mer polypeptides based on the N-terminal 20 amino acids of normal, polymorphic, and artificial AGT (see TableI), plus a C-terminal cysteine included for other purposes, were kindly made by P. Purkiss (now deceased) using an Applied Biosystems Inc. model 431A Peptide Synthesizer. They were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by amino acid analysis and mass spectroscopy. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the polypeptides were measured at a concentration of 0.3–0.5 mg/ml, at 20 °C, under nitrogen, in a 0.5-mm path length cuvette, using a Jasco J600 spectropolarimeter. Spectra are presented in terms of the differential molar extinction coefficient Δε = ΔεL − ΔεR(mol−1 cm−1), based on a mean residue molecular weight.

The coding region of pAGT (in pBluescriptKS+) was cloned into the KpnI and BamHI sites of the pALTER-1 mutagenesis vector (Promega, UK). Primers P7 and P8 (see TableII) were used to generate the Leu10Leu11 double and Arg209 single mutations, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant coding regions were recloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of the expression plasmid pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) to produce the clones pAGT(L10,L11) and pAGT(R209). Presence of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing. pAGT[Δ1–37) was produced as follows. pAGT (in pBluescriptKS+) was amplified by PCR using the primers P1 (which creates an NcoI site around the naturally occurring methionine at residue 38) and P2 (primes downstream of a naturally occurring unique AflIII site within the AGT coding region). The product was digested with NcoI and AflIII and then cloned back into the NcoI (cuts at a naturally occurring site around the normal initiating methionine) andAflIII sites of a version of pAGT in which the vectorAflIII site had previously been destroyed. This construct was used for in vitro transcription/translation. The coding region was cloned into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pHYK (7Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R. De Zoysa P.A.

The N-terminal deletion and the integrity of the PCR-generated sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The various AGT-GFP fusions were produced as follows. The regions encoding the N-terminal 20 amino acids of clones pAGT, pAGT(L11), and pAGT(L10,L11) (all in pBluescriptKS+) were amplified by PCR using the primer pair P5/P6 (see Table II). The PCR products were then cloned into theHindIII and BamHI sites of the GFP fusion vector pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH) using the primer-encoded restriction sites to produce N-terminal AGT-GFP fusion products that were then recloned into the HindIII/NotI sites of pCDNA3 to produce the clones pAGT20-GFP, pAGT20(L11)-GFP, and pAGT20(L10,L11)-GFP. These constructs were then re-amplified with the primers P5 and P9 (which adds PKSKL to the C terminus of GFP) using the proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and cloned into pCDNA3 using the primer-encodedHindIII and XbaI restriction sites to produce the constructs pAGT20-GFP-SKL, pAGT20(L11)-GFP-SKL, and pAGT20(L10,L11)-GFP-SKL. The N-terminally His-tagged constructs were originally cloned into the bacterial expression vector pTrcHisB (Invitrogen) for other purposes. pAGT (in pBluescriptKS+) was amplified by PCR using P3 (creates a translationally silent NheI site around the naturally occurring alanine and serine at residues 2 and 3) and P4 (primes downstream of a naturally occurring unique BstEII site within the AGT-coding region). The HindIII/BstEII fragment of the PCR product was cloned back into theHindIII/BstEII sites of pAGT to create an intermediate clone that was then cut with NheI andBamHI, and the insert was cloned into theNheI/BamHI sites of pTrcHisB. The resulting His-tagged fusion construct was then transferred into pCDNA3 by digesting with NcoI (cuts around the translation start site) and BamHI and then substituting the fragment for theNcoI/BamHI fragment of pAGT (in pBluescriptKS+) to make the intermediate clone pBSHis-AGT. The insert was then recloned into pCDNA3 using the vector HindIII/BamHI sites to make the construct pHis-AGT. In order to make pHis-AGT(L11R170), theBstEII/BamHI fragment of pAGT(L11R170) (in pBluescriptKS+) was substituted for the BstEII/BamHI fragment of pBSHis-AGT and then recloned into pCDNA3 as before. In vitro transcription and translation of constructs in pBluescriptKS+ or pCDNA3 was carried out as described previously (10Leiper J.M. Oatey P.B. Danpure C.J. J.

AGT was visualized using polyclonal rabbit anti-human AGT antiserum and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). The peroxisomal marker catalase was visualized using polyclonal guinea pig anti-human catalase antiserum followed by biotinylated goat anti-guinea pig IgG and Texas Red avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). Mitochondria were visualized using the autofluorescent vital stain MitoTracker (Molecular Probes, Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK). The fluorescence of fluorescein isothiocyanate and GFP was observed using excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 522 nm, respectively. For Texas Red and MitoTracker, excitation and emission wavelengths of 568 and 585 nm were used. The N terminus of normal AGT (encoded by the more common major AGXT allele) contains two neighboring helix-breaking prolines at residues 10 and 11, suggesting that this region would be unlikely to fold into an α-helix (5Purdue P.E. Takada Y. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, the replacement of Pro11 with a helix-forming leucine, as occurs in the less common polymorphic variant of AGT (encoded by theminor AGXT allele), was predicted to increase the likelihood of the N terminus adopting an α-helical conformation characteristic of an MTS (5Purdue P.E.

We have attempted to test the above prediction by analyzing the CD spectra of various synthetic 21-mer peptides based on the N terminus of AGT, in which the Pro11 and Pro10 are sequentially replaced by leucines (see “Materials and Methods” and Table I). Although the interpretation of CD spectra of peptides smaller than 40 residues must be treated with caution (23Drake A.F. Siligardi G. Biopolymers Peptide Sci. 1995; 4: 281Google Scholar), it is still possible to obtain an indication of the likelihood with which such peptides will adopt a particular conformation when part of a larger protein. All three peptides containing either Pro10 + Pro11, or Pro10 + Leu11, or Leu10 + Leu11 (PP, PL, or LL, see Table I) when dissolved in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, gave spectra characteristic of very low conformational order. The PP and PL peptides gave U-type spectra, whereas the LL peptide showed some evidence of order (Fig. 1) (24Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996Crossref Google Scholar). Because trifluoroethanol (TFE) is a well known inducer of α-helix formation, CD measurements were also carried out in a 50% TFE/water mixture to assess the relative abilities of the peptides to form α-helices. Measurements in a 20 mm aqueous solution of micellar SDS at pH 7.0 gave effectively the same results (data not shown). Even in 50% TFE, the PP peptide showed minimal tendency to form an α-helix (Fig. 1 and Table I). As N-terminal α-helices are common and important properties of MTSs (25von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), it is not surprising, therefore, that normal human AGT is not targeted to mitochondria in vivo or in vitro (6Purdue P.E.

Unexpectedly, the PL peptide containing the single Pro11 → Leu substitution showed only a marginally increased tendency to fold into an α-helix (Fig. 1 and Table I). Although this minor conformational change is associated with the ability of the polymorphic N-terminal 20 amino acids to direct the import of AGT and the reporter protein DHFR to isolated rat liver mitochondria, the efficiency of the import was very low (6Purdue P.E.

In addition, the Pro11 → Leu substitution was completely unable to target AGT to mitochondria in transfected tissue culture cells and to target only weakly AGT to mitochondria in human liverin situ (5Purdue P.E.

https://openalex.org/W1989189680,"ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) is a key regulator of transport in the secretory system. Like all small GTPases, deactivation of ARF1 requires a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that promotes hydrolysis of GTP to GDP on ARF1. Structure-function analysis of a GAP for ARF1 revealed that its activity in vivo requires not only a domain that catalyzes hydrolysis of GTP on ARF1 but also a non-catalytic domain. In this study, we show that the non-catalytic domain of GAP is required for its recruitment from cytosol to membranes and that this domain mediates the interaction of GAP with the transmembrane KDEL receptor. Blocking its interaction with the KDEL receptor leaves the GAP cytosolic and prevents the deactivation in vivo of Golgi-localized ARF1. Thus, these findings suggest that the KDEL receptor plays a critical role in the function of GAP by regulating its recruitment from cytosol to membranes, where it can then act on its membrane-restricted target, the GTP-bound form of ARF1.

Transport among intracellular membrane compartments is accomplished by membrane-bound carriers that are formed by the recruitment of cytosolic coat proteins onto membranes. Upon delivery to a target compartment, coat proteins must be released to the cytosol before transport carriers can fuse with the compartment.

Binding of GTP activates ARF1 and stabilizes its association with target membranes. In the early secretory system, the stabilized association of ARF1 with Golgi membranes leads to the recruitment of the cytosolic COPI coat proteins. Subsequently, hydrolysis of its bound GTP to GDP deactivates ARF1. As a result, both ARF1 and COPI are released from membranes to cytosol (1Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T.

However, the in vivo role of these regulators remains to be established in many cases, because their ability to localize to the same subcellular compartments as ARF1 and regulate its effector functions in these compartments remains uncertain. A GAP for ARF1 has been identified and shown to localize to the Golgi complex (8Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in mammalian cells, this ARF1 GAP induces a phenotype that is consistent with deactivation of Golgi-localized ARF1 (11Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This phenotype is manifest by the release of COPI from the Golgi complex and redistribution of the entire Golgi complex to the ER. Using this phenotype as an in vivo assay, we have identified at least two functional domains in ARF1 GAP (12Huber I. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Aoe T. Hsu V.W. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24786-24791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain resides in the amino portion of the protein as a truncated form of GAP that contains its first 257 amino acids is fully active in the in vitro GAP assay. However, this truncation mutant shows reduced activity in the in vivo assay of ARF1 deactivation. Thus, a non-catalytic domain that includes parts of the carboxyl terminus of GAP is also required for GAP activity on ARF1in vivo. Because the GTP-bound form of ARF1 is restricted to membranes (13Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 14Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Relevant to this possibility, we had previously shown that the transmembrane KDEL receptor associates with ARF1 GAP (11Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The KDEL receptor was originally defined to recognize a large class of soluble ER proteins with a carboxyl-terminal motif of lysine-aspartate-glutamate-leucine (KDEL) (17Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1349-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 18Lewis M.J. Sweet D.J. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These KDEL proteins perform essential functions in the ER related to protein folding and assembly (19Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3171-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Whenever these proteins escape from the ER and reach the Golgi complex, they are retrieved to the ER by the KDEL receptor (20Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The possibility that the KDEL receptor not only retrieves KDEL proteins but also regulates transport in the early secretory pathways was suggested initially by observations of yeast mutants with deleted KDEL receptors. These mutants not only could not retrieve KDEL proteins but also had dysregulated transport through the Golgi complex (17Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1349-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Elucidating how the KDEL receptor regulates transport, we showed that overexpression of the KDEL receptor induces a phenotype of ARF1 deactivation by interacting with ARF1 GAP (11Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, ligand binding by the KDEL receptor regulates its interaction with GAP (21Aoe T. Lee A.J. van Donselaar E. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of transport through the KDEL receptor appears fundamentally similar to many signal transduction processes in which membrane receptors act through either a GAP or GEF of key small GTPases to regulate different cellular events (22Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Although its interaction with ARF1 GAP is necessary for the KDEL receptor to affect ARF1 (11Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether GAP might also require this interaction to act on ARF1 in vivo. In this study, we find that the non-catalytic domain of GAP, which is essential for GAP activity in vivo, mediates the recruitment of cytosolic GAP to membranes and its interaction with the KDEL receptor. Abrogating this interaction redistributes GAP to the cytosol, where it no longer exhibits activity on ARF1 in vivo. Thus, interaction with the KDEL receptor is critical for GAP to act on ARF1in vivo. HeLa and COS-7 cells were grown in complete medium that consisted of Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 40 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. A HeLa cell line that stably expresses the Myc-tagged KDEL receptor had been generated as described previously (11Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W.

To generate a cell line that stably expressed wild type ARF1 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP), HeLa cells were transfected with a cDNA that encoded ARF1-GFP (cloned into the pEGFPN1 vector from CLONTECH) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were then selected with 800 μg/ml G-418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), sorted by flow cytometry for maximal expression of ARF1-GFP, and maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 150 μg/ml G-418. Immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and subcellular fractionation were performed as described previously (11Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (approximately 5 × 108) were scraped and washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and with homogenization buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) once. The cell pellet was resuspended in four volumes of homogenization buffer and then sheared by four passes through a ball-bearing homogenizer at 36 μm clearance (EMBL machine shop, Heidelberg, Germany). Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation for 2.5 h at 200,000 × g through a sucrose step gradient of 20, 30, and 70% (w/v) sucrose in 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA. Membranes were recovered from the 30–70% interface, and cytosol was recovered from the phase above 20% sucrose. Both fractions were adjusted to 2.5 mm MgCl2final concentration and stored at −80 °C. For the GAP recruitment assay, 1/20 of each fraction was used for individual incubation conditions, in which they were incubated together at 37 °C for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min. Equivalent fractions of the pellet and the supernatant were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using antibodies against β-COP, GAP, and calnexin. Quantitation of immunoblots was performed by ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). HeLa cells stably expressing ARF1-GFP were generated and then transiently transfected with the mutant KDEL receptor 5TM using LipofectAMINE in serum-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Between 24 and 48 h after transfection, the kinetics of ARF1-GFP dissociation from the Golgi complex was measured as described previously (25Vasudevan C. Han W. Tan Y. Nie Y. Li D. Shome K. Watkins S. Levitan E. Romero G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on coverglass were placed in a live cell chamber and imaged using a Molecular Dynamics 2001 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Cells were bathed in phenol red-free medium during the entire experiment and were excited at 488 nm with a krypton-argon laser (3% of maximal intensity). Emitted light was passed through a 530 nm barrier filter and detected using a photomultiplier tube. Time lapse experiments were carried out by scanning cells once every 30 s. Brefeldin A was added at 5 μg/ml final concentration after the first scan. Scans of the fluorescence intensity on the Golgi complex were quantified using ImageSpace software (Molecular Dynamics). These data were further analyzed using GraphPad Prism to determine the time course of ARF1 release from the Golgi complex. In cells transiently transfected with 5TM, half-lives of ARF1-GFP on the Golgi complex fell into a bimodal distribution with one population having a half-life similar to control cells. This population represented untransfected cells, whereas the other population represented cells transfected with 5TM. These two populations were confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy of fixed cells with double labeling for HA-tagged 5TM and ARF1-GFP. The half-lives of ARF1 dissociation from the Golgi complex were determined for both populations, grouped, and then analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post-test comparisons. To examine the role of the non-catalytic domain in ARF1 GAP, we first compared the intracellular distribution of wild type GAP with that found in a truncated form (GAP1-(1–257)). This mutant had been used in a previous study (12Huber I. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Aoe T. Hsu V.W. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24786-24791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to define a non-catalytic domain in GAP because it was active in vitro in catalyzing hydrolysis of GTP on ARF1 but its overexpression was ineffective in promoting a phenotype of ARF1 deactivation in vivo. Transfecting either form of GAP into cells followed by subcellular fractionation, we found that wild type GAP associated with the membrane fraction more efficiently than did GAP-(1–257) (Fig.1). The association of GAP-(1–257) with the membrane fraction could be attributed to its affinity to certain diacylglycerol moieties that are likely to exist on Golgi membranes (26Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, because wild type GAP associated with the membrane fraction even more efficiently, this result suggested that the non-catalytic domain of GAP potentially played an important rolein vivo by affecting the distribution of GAP between the membrane and cytosol. To test for this possibility, we performed an assay comparing the recruitment of wild type GAP and GAP-(1–257). For this purpose, total membranes and cytosol prepared from human HeLa cells were incubated together and supplemented with cytosol that overexpressed either wild type GAP or GAP-(1–257). Whereas a significant fraction of wild type GAP was recruited from cytosol to membranes, GAP-(1–257) remained cytosolic (Fig. 2). To examine the functional consequence of this difference in GAP recruitment, we determined the distribution of COPI between membranes and cytosol in the same experiment, because release of COPI from membranes reflects deactivation of ARF1 (27Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1365-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 28Teal S.B. Hsu V.W. Peters P.J. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3135-3138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As assessed by β-COP, incubation with cytosol that contained wild type GAP resulted in less membrane-bound β-COP as compared with incubation with cytosol that contained GAP-(1–257) (Fig. 2). Thus, GAP activity on ARF1 correlated with the recruitment of cytosolic GAP to membranes, and this recruitment required the non-catalytic domain. Because the KDEL receptor is a transmembrane protein that had been shown previously to interact with GAP (11Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we next tested whether this interaction is mediated by the non-catalytic domain of GAP. When a co-precipitation study was performed by immunoprecipitating for 6x-His-tagged GAP followed by immunoblotting for the Myc-tagged KDEL receptor, a significant amount of KDEL receptor was co-precipitated with wild type GAP but not with GAP-(1–257) (Fig.3). Thus, this result suggested that an interaction between the KDEL receptor and GAP requires the non-catalytic domain of GAP. If the interaction with KDEL receptor were required for the recruitment of GAP to membranes, then disrupting the interaction would be predicted to prevent membrane localization of GAP. By deleting the cytoplasmic tail and the last two transmembrane domains of the KDEL receptor, we had previously generated a mutant KDEL receptor (5TM). Overexpression of 5TM blocked the interaction of the KDEL receptor with GAP by sequestering wild type KDEL receptors into oligomers that could no longer interact with GAP (11Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To test whether overexpression of 5TM would prevent membrane localization of GAP, we transfected GAP either with or without 5TM into HeLa cells. Upon fractionation into total membranes and cytosol, we found that membrane distribution of GAP was significantly impaired in cells that co-overexpressed 5TM (Fig.4). To examine the in vivo consequences of preventing GAP from localizing to membranes, we assessed whether 5TM overexpression blocked the ability of overexpressed GAP to induce a phenotype of ARF1 deactivation. A manifestation of this phenotype is the redistribution of the entire Golgi complex to the ER (11Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Hsu V.W. Shah N. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 625-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, we assayed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy the integrity of the Golgi complex. Cells that overexpressed GAP alone had the Golgi complex redistributed to the ER, whereas cells that co-overexpressed 5TM and GAP no longer had the Golgi complex redistributed to the ER. (Fig.5). To determine whether 5TM overexpression also blocked the activity of endogenous GAP on ARF1, we examined the effect of 5TM overexpression on the distribution of ARF1 between the Golgi complex and cytosol, as this distribution reflects whether ARF1 is in its activated or deactivated form (13Donaldson J.G.

Regulation of this fusion protein has been shown to resemble that of wild type ARF1 (25Vasudevan C. Han W. Tan Y. Nie Y. Li D. Shome K. Watkins S. Levitan E. Romero G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells with 5TM overexpression, the fluorescent signal of GFP-tagged ARF1 at the Golgi complex was more intense than in control cells (Fig.6 A). By quantitative confocal microscopy, this increase was approximately 2-fold, suggesting that 5TM overexpression enhanced activation of ARF1. In principle, because the steady-state distribution of ARF1 on Golgi membranes reflects the net activities of its GAP and GEF (13Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 15Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12083-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5TM overexpression could have enhanced activation of ARF1 by either enhancing its GEF activity or inhibiting its GAP activity. Thus, we examined the effect of 5TM overexpression on ARF1 localization to the Golgi complex in the presence of BFA, which blocks the contribution of GEF activity on ARF1 (16Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 30Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of BFA, the rate at which ARF1 was released from the Golgi complex was slowed by 2-fold in cells that had been transfected with 5TM as compared with the rate of ARF1 release in cells that had not been transfected with 5TM (Fig.6 B). This result correlated with a 2-fold increase in the steady-state distribution of ARF1 at the Golgi complex seen upon 5TM overexpression (Fig. 6 A). Thus, collectively, the effects of 5TM overexpression suggested that GAP activity on ARF1 in vivo was reduced when an interaction between the KDEL receptor and GAP was disrupted. In this study, we find that recruitment of ARF1 GAP from cytosol to membranes is mediated by its non-catalytic domain, which interacts with the transmembrane KDEL receptor. When this interaction is abrogated by a mutant KDEL receptor (5TM), GAP remains cytosolic and no longer exhibits in vivo activity on ARF1. Collectively, these findings suggest that the KDEL receptor plays a critical role in the activity of GAP by regulating its recruitment from cytosol to membranes, where it can then act on its membrane-restricted target, the GTP-bound form of ARF1. Significantly, like COPI and ARF1, the GAP that regulates these key transport components is also regulated by its recruitment from cytosol to membranes. Of particular relevance to this comparison is that recruitment of COPI appears to involve interactions with both the lipid and protein components of its target membrane, as evidence exists for COPI interacting with phosphoinositide moieties of membranes (31Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and also with cytoplasmic motifs of transmembrane proteins (32Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 33Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In this regard, GAP-(1–257) has been shown previously to interact with certain diacylglycerol moieties of membranes (26Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and this may be the basis for some of its membrane association seen upon subcellular fractionation in this study. However, by itself, this lipid interaction does not seem sufficient to confer GAP activity in vivo, because overexpression of GAP-(1–257) cannot effectively induce a phenotype of ARF1 deactivation (12Huber I. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Aoe T. Hsu V.W. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24786-24791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, like COPI (34Bremser M. Nickel W. Schweikert M. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Hughes C.A. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), the interaction of GAP with a protein component on the target membrane is also critical for its function, and this requirement appears to be fulfilled by an interaction between the non-catalytic domain of GAP and the transmembrane KDEL receptor. As the KDEL receptor cycles between the ER and the Golgi complex, regulating GAP recruitment through the KDEL receptor would seemingly localize GAP equally well to membranes of both the ER and the Golgi complex. However, GAP is localized mostly to the Golgi complex (8Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). An explanation is suggested by our previous observation that ligand binding by the KDEL receptor regulates its association with GAP (21Aoe T. Lee A.J. van Donselaar E. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, because KDEL proteins bind to the KDEL receptor at the Golgi complex (20Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), GAP would be recruited mainly to Golgi membranes. However, as ARF1 deactivation by its GAP promotes the release of COPI from its target membranes (27Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1365-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 28Teal S.B. Hsu V.W. Peters P.J. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3135-3138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), activation of GAP by the KDEL receptor at the Golgi complex would seemingly prevent the recruitment of COPI onto Golgi membranes. Yet, ligand binding by the KDEL receptor induces its movement into retrograde COPI-coated vesicles at the Golgi complex (35Orci L. Stamnes M. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 335-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Thus, as the yeast homologues of GAP has been shown to regulate retrograde transport from the Golgi complex to the ER (36Poon P.P. Cassel D. Spang A. Rotman M. Pick E. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), another possibility is that GAP is being recruited to Golgi membranes by the KDEL receptor to regulate transport mediated by retrograde COPI-coated vesicles. In considering how these two apparently incongruous possibilities can be reconciled, a potential insight is that the target of GAP is the activated form of ARF1 (8Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, rather than competing with the GEF that activates ARF1, and thereby preventing the recruitment of COPI onto its target membranes altogether, the GAP recruited to Golgi membranes by the KDEL receptor may act only after GEF has acted on ARF1 to initiate the formation of COPI-coated vesicles. Relevant to this consideration, COPI has recently been shown to regulate the catalytic activity of GAP on ARF1 (37Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A possibility based on this observation is that, as more COPI is being recruited to form coated buds, GAP may be activated to release ARF1 from membranes of newly forming vesicles. Thus, rather than acting on ARF1 after the complete formation of COPI-coated vesicles, GAP might act during a late stage of vesicle maturation. This scenario would be similar to findings on transport mediated by COPII (38Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) or clathrin AP-1 (39Zhu Y. Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1323-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), where their mature coated vesicles were found to lack a significant level of the responsible small GTPase, suggesting that the relevant GAP acts during the maturation of these vesicles. Thus, future elucidation of how the interaction between the KDEL receptor and GAP regulates retrograde transport will likely contribute to determining the precise role of GAP in retrograde transport from the Golgi complex to the ER.

Mutations in the APP gene or in two unrelated genes, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, are a leading cause of early-onset, inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease. Strikingly, all of the mutations linked to Alzheimer's disease increase the amount of Aβ42 that is secreted from cultured cells or extracted from the transgenic mouse brain and human plasma, whereas only some of the mutations are characterized by increased Aβ40 (reviewed in Refs. 3Selkoe D.J.

These observations suggest Aβ42 has a central role in amyloid plaque formation and, hence, in the pathogenesis of disease. The two major COOH-terminal variants of Aβ could be generated in several different ways. First, there may be a single γ-secretase capable of cleaving at both Aβ40 and Aβ42. Alternatively, two distinct endoproteinases, with different substrate preferences and inhibitor sensitivities, could generate the two distinct species of Aβ. A third possibility is that a single γ-secretase generates Aβ42, which subsequently is processed by a carboxypeptidase to form Aβ40. The resolution of these alternatives will direct efforts to identify the protease, or proteases, responsible for formation of the Aβ variants and will pose different questions about molecular and cellular mechanisms of γ-secretase processing. Resolution of these alternatives may also have important implications for therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting Aβ production and interfering with amyloid deposition. If there are two distinct γ-secretases, the central role of Aβ42 in plaque formation argues for the importance of inhibiting the γ-secretase responsible for formation of Aβ42 and suggests that it may be possible to block production of Aβ42 without interfering with Aβ40. If, on the other hand, both species are generated by a single γ-secretase or if Aβ42 serves as a precursor for Aβ40, then inhibitors of Aβ42 production would be expected to block formation of Aβ40 as well. Studies of the inhibition of cellular secretion of Aβ variants have suggested that different γ-secretases may generate Aβ40 and Aβ42 (14Klafki H.-W. Abramowski D. Swoboda R. Paganetti P.A.

The existence of two γ-secretases has been suggested by the observation that a given concentration of peptidyl-aldehyde or -difluoroketoamide protease inhibitors blocks secretion of Aβ40 but elevates Aβ42.

The close spacing of the doses and the triplicate cultures were chosen to allow reliable determination of IC50 values despite the steepness of the dose-response curves (see Fig. 3). At the end of the conditioning period, the plates were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, and the medium was loaded onto ELISA plates at appropriate dilutions for determination of Aβ40 and Aβ42. The Aβ40- and Aβ42-selective ELISAs have been described and characterized extensively (24Savage M.J. Trusko S.P. Howland D.S. Pinsker L.R. Mistretta S. Reaume A.G. Greenberg B.D. Siman R. Scott R.W.

To characterize further the effects of the five protease inhibitors on APP processing, levels of COOH-terminal derivatives of APP were measured. As shown in Fig. 2 (bottom panel), at a dose that blocked Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion by more than 90%, compounds A and B elevated two [35S]Met-labeled COOH-terminal APP derivatives that serve as γ-secretase substrates, the ∼12-kDa β-secretase-derived C99 fragment, and the ∼9-kDa α-secretase-derived C83 fragment (5Cai X.-D.

Collectively, these data demonstrate that compounds used in the present analysis do not markedly reduce APP synthesis or block α- or β-secretase processing but instead inhibit the γ-secretase processing step.Figure 2Inhibitors of Aβ secretion also inhibit secretion of p3 and elevate steady-state levels of the precursor to Aβ, C99 .Duplicate cultures of M17 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met while being treated with the indicated compound.Top panel, Aβ and p3 were immunoprecipitated from the medium with Ab1153.

This cell line stably overexpresses C99 with tetrapeptide extensions, EVKM-(C99)-YCFA (23Kuentzel S.L. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P.A. Lowery D.E. Altman R.A. Leone J.W. Heinrikson R.L. Greenberg B.D.

A similar construct, with most of the NH2-terminal APP sequence deleted, has been used previously to study sequence specificity of γ-secretase cleavage (30Lichtenthaler S.F. Ida N. Multhaup G.

Under the protocol described here, medium conditioned by HeLa-pNAN8 cells for 4 h accumulates 7.0 to 8.5 ng of Aβ40/ml and 0.9 to 1.5 ng of Aβ42/ml. Aβ42 constitutes ∼14% of the total, as it does in medium conditioned by cell lines expressing full-length APP (e.g.Ref. 31Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Aβ accumulation is linear with respect to time over 4 h. The high level of Aβ secretion by HeLa-pNAN8 cells facilitates measurement of dose-dependent alterations in secretion of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 by protease inhibitors. Discriminative electrophoretic and ELISA analyses indicate that Aβ40 and Aβ42 are the predominant Aβ forms being measured, although a minor contribution of Aβ forms whose NH2 termini are within 2–3 residues of Asp-1 cannot be ruled out.2 Fig. 3 A illustrates the dose-response curves for inhibition of Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion by the difluoroketoamide Compound B. The qualitative features of the dose-response curve are the same for all γ-secretase inhibitors tested. The most striking feature is the approximately 7-fold elevation of Aβ42 secretion at sub-inhibitory doses. Among the five γ-secretase inhibitors tested, elevations of Aβ42 ranged from 3- to 8-fold. At the peak of the elevation, Aβ42 constituted as much as 50% of the total secreted Aβ. Another feature of the dose-response curves is their steepness. Hill slopes ranged from 1.8 to 4.9 for Aβ40 and from 3.0 to 5.3 for Aβ42. The steepness of the dose-response curves dictated the close spacing of compound doses chosen in these experiments (six doses per log unit). A compound was identified that elevated Aβ42 secretion at relatively low doses, without causing inhibition even at much higher doses. Fig.4 shows dose-dependent effects on Aβ secretion of compound N, described previously as a potent inhibitor of a variety of aspartyl proteases (IC50<60 nm for cathepsin D, endothelin-converting enzyme, and renin; see Ref. 19Shiosaki K. Tasker A.S. Sullivan G.M. Sorensen B.K. von Geldern T.W. Wu-Wong J.R. Marselle C.A. Opgenorth T.J. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Compound N elevated Aβ42 secretion nearly 6-fold, with an estimated EC50 about 500 nm. At doses 100-fold higher, compound N did not inhibit secretion of either Aβ40 or Aβ42. In the presence of 10 μm compound N, a saturating concentration for elevation of Aβ42, dose-response curves for the five γ-secretase inhibitors showed little or no further elevation of Aβ42 (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the γ-secretase inhibitors and compound N share a common mechanism for elevation of Aβ42 secretion. The presence of compound N did not interfere with inhibition of Aβ secretion by the γ-secretase inhibitors tested; indeed, the IC50 values in the presence of compound N are somewhat lower than in its absence. Consequently, the elevation of Aβ42 can be separated pharmacologically from inhibition of γ-secretase and blockade of Aβ42 and Aβ40 secretion. Two methods were used to compare the rank-order of inhibitor potencies for Aβ40 and Aβ42. In the first, the IC50 for Aβ42 was empirically defined as the dose at which Aβ42 secretion declines to half of its peak (elevated) value and was estimated by fitting the data to a sigmoidal dose-response with variable slope and the top fixed to the observed peak. Fig. 5 Asummarizes the relationship between the IC50 values measured for Aβ40 and for Aβ42. For the five γ-secretase inhibitors tested, the IC50 values fall near a trend line with unit slope. The rank-order of these compounds for inhibition of Aβ42 is identical to their rank-order for inhibition of Aβ40. In the second method, IC50 values for Aβ40 and Aβ42 were compared in the presence of 10 μm Compound N to saturate the elevation of Aβ42 at low γ-secretase inhibitor concentrations. Because the Aβ42 dose responses look like pure inhibition under this condition, determination of the Aβ42 IC50 by this method is straightforward. IC50 values measured by this method fall near a trend line with unit slope, exactly like the empirical IC50 values (Fig. 5 B). TableI summarizes IC50 values determined by both methods. By both methods, the rank-order of γ-secretase inhibitors for inhibition of Aβ42 is identical to their rank-order for inhibition of Aβ40.Table IIC50 values for inhibition of Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretionCompoundIsostereIC50(μm)IC50 (μm) in presence of compound NAβ40Aβ42Aβ40Aβ42AAldehyde2.3 ± 0.33.0 ± 0.30.900.74n = 5n = 3(0.79–1.03)(0.64–0.86)BDifluoroketoamide5.6 ± 0.56.1 ± 0.74.75.1n = 4n = 3(4.5–4.9)(4.9–5.4)CAldehyde1425NDND(12–17)(22–28)DAldehyde34 ± 2372927n = 2(35–40)(25–33)(24–31)EAldehyde103102NDND(88–120)(86–122)When multiple independent experiments are available, IC50values are expressed as mean ± S.D.

When only a single experiment is available, the values in parentheses below the IC50 values are 95% confidence limits. ND, not determined. If both Aβ40 and Aβ42 are generated by a single γ-secretase, the rank-order of inhibitor potencies against these two cleavages should be the same. The potencies need not be identical, because in each case the inhibitor is competing with a distinct substrate sequence for which the protease may have different affinities. If, on the other hand, two different γ-secretases cleave the precursor at these two sites, there ought to be good inhibitors of one that are poor inhibitors of the other, and the rank-order of inhibitor potencies for the two Aβ species should differ. To distinguish between these possibilities, we have examined the dose-dependent inhibition of Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion by a panel of five structurally diverse γ-secretase inhibitors. Previous studies using only one or two doses of protease inhibitor have demonstrated differential effects on Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion, and these data have been used to argue for the existence of two distinct γ-secretases (14Klafki H.-W.

We demonstrate here that comparison of inhibitor effects at only one or two concentrations is not straightforward, because the dose response for Aβ42 is the superposition of two effects as follows: elevation of Aβ42 production at relatively low doses and inhibition at higher doses. Elevations in Aβ42 secretion have been observed previously, as synthetic intermediates of a difluoroketoamide γ-secretase inhibitor are inactive against Aβ40 secretion at 200 μm but elevate Aβ42 (Compounds 5–7 in Ref. 16Wolfe M.S.

Peptide aldehydes, described as calpain inhibitors, have also been reported to elevate secretion of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 and to increase the ratio of Aβ42 to total Aβ (32Yamazaki T. Haass C. Saido T.C.

(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23675-23680). Its disulfide topology was confirmed by Edman degradation, and its three-dimensional solution structure was determined by two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy at 500 MHz. Structural constraints (consisting of 348 nuclear Overhauser effect interproton distances, 8 backbone dihedral constraints, and 9 disulfide distance constraints) were used as an input to the X-PLOR program for simulated annealing and energy minimization calculations. The final set of 10 structures had a mean pairwise root mean square deviation of 0.32 A for the backbone atoms and 1.04 A for all heavy atoms. The structure of AAI consists of a short triple-stranded beta-sheet stabilized by three disulfide bonds, forming a typical knottin or inhibitor cystine knot fold found in miniproteins, which binds various macromolecular ligands. When the first intercystine segment of AAI (sequence IPKWNR) was inserted into a homologous position of the spider toxin Huwentoxin I, the resulting chimera showed a significant inhibitory activity, suggesting that this segment takes part in enzyme binding."

To examine phosphorylation-dependent structural changes near the head-tail junction, we prepared five well regulated heavy meromyosins containing single-cysteine mutants of the human smooth muscle regulatory light chain labeled with the photocross-linking reagent, benzophenone-iodoacetamide. For those mutants that generated cross-links, only one type of cross-linked species was observed, a regulatory light chain dimer. Irradiated mutants fell into two classes. First, for Q15C, A23C, and wild type (Cys-108), a regulatory light chain dimer was formed for dephosphorylated but not thiophosphorylated heavy meromyosin. These data provide direct chemical evidence that in the dephosphorylated state, Gln-15, Ala-23, and Cys-108 on one head are positioned near (within 8.9 Å) the regulatory light chain of the partner head and that thiophosphorylation abolishes proximity. This behavior was also observed for the Q15C mutant on a truncated heavy meromyosin lacking both catalytic domains. For the actin-heavy meromyosin complex, cross-links were formed in both de- and thiophosphorylated states. S59C and T134C mutants were in a second mutant class, where regulatory light chain dimers were not detected in dephosphorylated or thiophosphorylated heavy meromyosin, suggesting positions outside the region of interaction of the regulatory light chains.

The actin-activated ATPase activity and motor properties of smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosins are regulated by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (1Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R.

The dephosphorylated forms of these regulated myosins have low ATPase activity and are unable to move actin filaments, whereas phosphorylated forms are activated in both respects.

Therefore, two heads are critical for down-regulation, suggesting that head-head interaction is an important feature of the dephosphorylated state. However, a double-headed structure may not be sufficient for full regulation, and interactions between heads and rods may also be required (10Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc.

Indeed, the RLC has been shown to be critical to the regulatory mechanism. In particular, disruption of the COOH-terminal domain (12Ikebe M. Reardon S. Mitani Y. Kamisoyama H. Matsuura M. Ikebe R.

Smooth muscle myosin with exchanged skeletal RLC was not activated by phosphorylation (16Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the RLC, the ELC appears to be less important to regulation because it can be replaced by the skeletal isoform or removed entirely with little effect on regulation (17Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The requirements for full regulation in smooth muscle myosin are complex, because of a subtle interplay between the light chain domain, the actin binding loop (18Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the catalytic domain (19Sata M. Stafford W.F. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18423-18428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The exact location of the phosphorylated serine (S19 in chicken gizzard) of the RLC is not known. The analogous residue was found to be within a disordered region of the NH2 terminus in the crystal structures of both skeletal S1 (21Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 1-58Google Scholar) and the light chain domain of scallop myosin (22Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Science. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar). It is possible that this region adopts an ordered structure in a double-headed molecule. Clearly, more information about the structure of the head-tail junction including the RLC is needed to understand the phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanism. Our approach has been to use direct chemical methods to further define this region by looking for conformational differences between the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of smooth muscle HMM. Specifically, we have placed photocross-linking probes selectively throughout the RLC by use of a set of single cysteine mutants. We have labeled two residues within the putative flexible NH2-terminal region (Q15C and A23C), two within the COOH-terminal domain (Cys-108 and T134C), and one within the NH2-terminal domain (S59C). After exchange of the labeled RLC into HMM, we found that cross-linked RLC-RLC dimers were formed after irradiation of Q15C, A23C, and WT (Cys-108) but not of S59C or T134C. These RLC-RLC dimers were not formed after irradiation of the respective thiophosphorylated HMMs. Our results suggest that regions of the RLC of one head are proximal to the RLC of the other head in dephosphorylated HMM, and this proximity is abolished in the phosphorylated state. We also show that this conformational change occurs independently of the catalytic domain. SMM was prepared from frozen chicken gizzards (23Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol.

Smooth muscle HMM was obtained from a Staphylococcus aureus protease (Sigma) digest of SMM (200–400 mg) as described previously (5Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J.

SMM and HMM concentrations were determined using the following extinction coefficients: SMM, ε2801.0% = 5.6; HMM, ε2801.0% = 6.5. Truncated nonmuscle heavy meromyosin IIB, a brain isoform lacking both catalytic domains, was a gift from Dr. J. Sellers and Dr. F. Wang. The light chain mutants were prepared by introducing a cysteine residue into (or substituting from) the recombinant human smooth muscle RLC using oligo-site-directed mutagenesis and polymerase chain reaction techniques. Human smooth muscle RLC mutants Q15C, A23C, S59C, and T134C were prepared by substitution of Gln-15, Ala-23, Ser-59, and Thr-134 with cysteine, respectively, and Cys-108 of each was replaced by alanine. The cDNA for the human RLC was subcloned into M13mp19 at the EcoRI restriction site. Site-directed mutagenesis using the Skulptor Mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to substitute the endogenous Cys-108 with alanine and Glu-15, Ala-23, Ser-59, or Thr-134 with cysteine. The oligo for making the Cys-108 to alanine substitution was 5′-CGTCGAATGCGGCAAAGGCG-3′.

Polymerase chain reaction using TAQ polymerase was used to construct the mutant Q15C. The 5′-oligo introduced a NdeI restriction site at the start Met-1 as well as introducing the Gln-15 to cysteine. The 5′-oligo sequence was 5′-CCAGAACGCCCATATGTCCAGCAAGCGGGCCAAAGCCAAGGCCACCAAGAAGCGGCCATGCCGGGCC-3′. The 3′-oligo used in polymerase chain reaction was complimentary to the 3′ end of the coding region of the RLC with an introducedEcoRI site at the end of the primer. The 3′-oligo was 5′-CCGGAATTCTCACGTCTGCCCCGC-3′. TA-cloning (Invitrogen) was done directly using the polymerase chain reaction mix with the Invitrogen protocol. Mutant RLC DNAs were confirmed by sequencing and then subcloned into the His-tag vector pET 15b (Novagen) adding GHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH to the NH2 terminus of Met-1 of the RLC. Host cells used for the expression were Escherichia coliBL21(DE3). 10 ml of overnight culture at 37 °C was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB-amp broth. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm when the A 600 reached 0.8. Cultures continued to grow for 6 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6300 × g for 20 min, and 25 ml of 8m urea, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mmNaCl was added to each pellet bringing the total volume to 50 ml for 1 liter of culture and stirred on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was then treated with 100 μg of leupeptin (Sigma), 100 μg of pepstatin (Sigma), and 200 μg of DNase (Sigma)/1 liter of culture and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged at 150,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated at room temperature with TALON™ metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) for 30 min and centrifuged at 3,100 × g for 10 min. The resin was resuspended with denaturing buffer, stirred for 10 min, and then centrifuged for 10 min. Resuspension and centrifugation were repeated three more times. The RLC mutant was eluted with 0.2 m imidazole in the denaturing buffer, and the resuspension-centrifugation procedure was repeated four times. The combined supernatant was dialyzed to 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm EDTA and labeled with benzophenone-4-iodoacetamide (Sigma) as described previously (25Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The concentrations of labeled hisRLCs (BP-hisRLCs) were determined using the extinction coefficient of ε302 M = 22,500m−1 cm−1 (25Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Exchanges of native RLC of HMM for BP-mutant RLC were performed as described previously (26Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. Bioconjugate Chem. 1992; 3: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Excess free RLC in the exchange mixture (typically 20 mg of HMM) was removed by a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (2.6 × 60 cm; 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT). Base-line separation was achieved between the exchanged HMM and the excess free RLC. HMM/BP-hisRLC fractions were pooled and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of saturated ammonium sulfate (pH 8.0) and then dialyzed to 15 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT. Thrombin (Sigma) was added (1 unit/mg HMM/BP-hisRLC), and the mixture was incubated on ice for 4 h. Densitometric scanning of 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed that over 96% of His6 tags were removed from the RLC by thrombin treatment. HMM/BP-RLC was dialyzed to 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT immediately after thrombin treatment. HMM/BP-RLC was phosphorylated by incubating in 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 4 μg/ml calmodulin, 30 μg/ml myosin light chain kinase (27Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and 1.5 mm ATPγS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 25 °C and pH 7.0 for 1 h followed by incubating on ice overnight. Complete thiophosphorylation was verified by 8 m urea gel electrophoresis (4Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylated control samples were prepared by adding 10 mm EGTA and 5 mm EDTA prior to adding the other components for thiophosphorylation. The buffer was changed to irradiation buffer (10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmDTT) by Sephadex G-50 (Sigma) centrifugal gel filtration (5-ml column, 0.8-ml load volume). HMM/BP-RLC solutions were centrifuged (350,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant fractions were filtered through a 0.45-micron nylon Acrodisc filter (Gelman). The two gel filtration steps, ultracentrifugation and filtration, were sufficient for removing aggregated HMM, as determined by native gel electrophoresis (24Persechini A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6293-6299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fresh DTT was added to 1 mm to the HMM/BP-RLC solutions before irradiation. To effect cross-linking, 200 μl of 1.2–1.4 mg/ml HMM solution in a 1.5-ml clear microfuge tube was irradiated through a Pyrex filter with a UV lamp (450 Watts, ACE Glass Incorporated) on ice as described previously (25Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis was performed in the presence of 0.1% SDS with a 4–20% acrylamide gradient gel (Tris-glycine from Novex, San Diego, CA). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Sister gels were transferred to nitrocellulose for subsequent blotting. Western blots were performed by standard procedure (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) for both RLC and ELC antibodies. Polyclonal rabbit anti-RLC antibody and donkey anti-rabbit antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as the first and second antibodies, respectively, for RLC blotting. Mouse anti-ELC monoclonal antibody (a gift from Dr. K. Trybus) and sheep anti-mouse antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as the first and second antibodies for ELC blotting. A Renaissance chemiluminescence kit (NEN Life Science Products) was used to visualize the antibody cross-reaction with RLC and ELC. Gels and films were scanned with a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) for presentation. Fig. 1 documents a representative HMM preparation used in this study. HMM (Fig. 1, lane 2) was prepared from chicken gizzard myosin (Fig. 1, lane 1). Labeled mutant RLC (Fig. 1, lane 3; BP-A23C RLC) was mixed with HMM (10 RLC/1 HMM head; lane 4) and exchanged for endogenous native RLC by a method previously shown (16Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9539-9545Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to maintain phosphorylation-dependent regulation (TableI). Excess RLC was removed by gel filtration (Fig. 1, lane 5). Exchange efficiency (typically 75–90%; maximum theoretical value is 95%) could then be determined by densitometry using the ELC to normalize loading amounts. The density of the hisRLC was determined in an independent experiment to be 1.13-fold greater than the RLC. His tags were then removed (>98%) by thrombin treatment (Fig. 1, lane 7) to avoid potential alteration of regulatory properties of HMM. Thrombin-cleaved mutant RLC migrated slightly above the native RLC because of an additional four amino acids (GSHM). Quantitation of the light chain region by densitometry showed that the ratio of RLC (including both the thrombin-cleaved mutant band and the native band) to ELC for the exchanged samples was within 5% of the value for the unexchanged control HMM (data not shown). This suggests that the gel filtration protocol used here removes essentially all of the excess RLC used during the exchange procedure. The preparation shown in Fig. 1(lane 7) was similar to all HMM/BP-RLC mutants prepared, and the respective protein was used for subsequent phosphorylation, ATPase activity, and irradiation studies.Table ISteady-state ATPase activitiesHMM sampleaThe control was untreated HMM.

The rate of hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont) was measured (42White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 982-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time points for dephosphorylated HMMs (0.4 mg/ml; 2.1 μm heads) were quenched at 6, 12, 18, and 24 min. Thiophosphorylated HMMs (0.2 mg/ml) were quenched at 2, 4, 6, and 8 min. The effects of thiophosphorylation upon the actin-activated ATPase activity of control HMM and all HMM/BP-RLC mutants (unirradiated) are shown in Table I. All samples behaved similarly to the control (unexchanged) HMM. As expected from previous studies (5Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the HMMs lacked activation by thiophosphorylation in the absence of actin but in the presence of actin showed an increase in activity upon thiophosphorylation. The exact fold activation in the presence of actin because of thiophosphorylation was difficult to quantitate from these data because the dephosphorylated activities were low and close to our range of error. However, the activities of the thiophosphorylated samples were all within a factor of 2 of the control. These results show that the HMM/BP-RLC preparations were regulated by thiophosphorylation and therefore were used for subsequent irradiation studies. Fig. 2 shows the effect of irradiation of HMM/BP-Q15C 2HMM/BP-Q15C indicates HMM exchanged with benzophenone-4-iodoacetamide-labeled Q15C RLC mutant. The same nomenclature is used for all mutants. with UV light to activate the benzophenone moiety for cross-linking to proximal residues. In the dephosphorylated HMM (Fig. 2 A, lane 1), irradiation generated a new band (lanes 2–5) migrating between 34.1 and 51.6 kDa (molecular mass markers not shown) and migrating just below actin (42 kDa) consistent with the expected behavior of a RLC-RLC dimer (RLC = 20 kDa). This band was identified as such after Western blot analysis showed cross-reaction with RLC (Fig. 2 B) but not ELC (Fig. 2 C) antibodies. The RLC-RLC dimer band was also generated in the presence of MgADP and MgATP (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 9, respectively) and in the presence of actin (Fig. 2, lanes 10). The amount of RLC converted to the RLC-RLC dimer was estimated by scanning Coomassie-stained gels in the light chain region using the ELC for normalization of loaded protein. This analysis showed that the cross-linking efficiency was about 12% for all irradiation conditions, including in the presence of 125 and 500 mmNaCl (lanes 6 and 7, respectively). The RLC-RLC dimer band was the only new band observed after irradiation (Fig. 2). Cross-linking was not observed from the RLC to the heavy chain nor to the ELC. In addition intramolecular RLC cross-linking was not detected. To test for this, dilute solutions of free RLC were irradiated to determine the positions on the gels of intramolecularly cross-linked RLC. All new bands migrated below the unirradiated RLC (data not shown). However, these bands were not evident in experiments with the RLC bound to the heavy chain in the HMM (Fig. 2). Therefore, we concluded that the HMM-bound RLC did not cross-link intramolecularly but only intermoleculary to form RLC-RLC dimers.Figure 2Coomassie-stained gel (A), RLC Western blot (B), and ELC Western blot (C) for dephosphorylated and thiophosphorylated (D–F, respectively) HMM/BP-Q15C. Irradiation times and additions to 3.5 μm HMM in irradiation buffer are indicated at the top of each set of panels.

Control experiments (not shown) indicate that irradiation of unlabeled HMM generates no new bands and has no effect upon the ATPase activity up until 20 min of irradiation. This is also true for myosin (25Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Cole D.G. Yount R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22537-22546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For all gels shown (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Two lanes are designated NaCl; the left lane is 125 mm NaCl, and theright lane is 500 mm NaCl (in other figures where only one lane is designated NaCl, it is 500 mm NaCl). Control experiments with actin alone showed no cross-reactivity to the RLC (see Fig. 4) or ELC antibody (data not shown). All lanes in each gel are from the same actual gel and therefore represent the same exposure of the film. The RLC can appear as two closely spaced bands with the labeled RLC migrating above the unlabeled RLC. The exact appearance of the doublet depends upon the mutant, the extent of exchange and the particular gel and loading. We have no clear evidence that irradiation causes new bands to appear within this RLC doublet region.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast to the results for the dephosphorylated HMM/BP-Q15C, the identical experiment for the thiophosphorylated protein showed no evidence for a RLC-RLC dimer (Fig. 2, D–F), except after irradiation in the presence of actin (Fig. 2, D andE). Therefore, the results for the HMM/BP-Q15C suggest that there is a clear conformational difference between the dephosphorylated and thiophosphorylated states. The dephosphorylated state apparently positions Cys-15 (Gln-15 in the native RLC) from one head close enough to the other head to allow for cross-linking, whereas this event cannot occur in the thiophosphorylated state. As evidenced by RLC Western blots, this same general pattern of cross-linking was observed for the HMM/BP-A23C (Fig.3, A and C) and for the HMM/BP-WT (Cys-108; Fig. 3, B and D). Cross-reaction was not observed with the ELC antibody under any condition (data not shown). Interestingly, these two mutants (both dephosphorylated and thiophosphorylated), like Q15C, also showed generation of an RLC-RLC dimer after irradiation in the presence of actin. The two other mutants studied, HMM/BP-S59C and HMM/BP-T134C, showed a different behavior to those discussed above (Q15C, A23C, and WT (Cys-108)). In the dephosphorylated state no cross-linking was observed by Coomassie-stained gels (data not shown) or Western blot analysis using RLC antibodies (Fig. 4,A and B), except for S59C in the presence of actin. As before, ELC cross-reaction was not observed under any condition (data not shown). Thiophosphorylated m"

We previously reported cloning and characterization of a gene encoding for membrane-bound PITP, named PITPnm, that is a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila retinal degeneration B (rdgB) gene (Aikawa, Y., Hara, H., and Watanabe, T. (1997)Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 236, 559–564). Here we report the subcellular localization of PITPnm protein and provide evidence for its involvement in phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns 4-P) synthesis. PITPnm is an integral membrane protein that largely localized in close association with membranes of Golgi vacuoles and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The amino terminus region of PITPnm was exposed to cytoplasmic side. Interaction with various phosphoinositides was observed in the amino terminus region spanning from 196 amino acids to 257 amino acids of PITPnm. At the amino terminus regions of 1–372 amino acids, PITPnm formed a complex with type III PtdIns 4-kinase. The transmembrane and carboxyl-terminal portions (residues 418–1242) functioned to retain the PITPnm in the Golgi vacuole. These results suggest that PITPnm plays a role in phosphoinositide synthesis on the Golgi vacuoles and possibly in the PtdIns signaling pathway in mammalian cells.

To understand the role of the PITPnm protein in signaling in mammalian cells, it is important to determine its subcellular localization and steps of the PtdIns signaling pathway in which the PITPnm may be involved. In the present study, we demonstrate that PITPnm interacts with type III PtdIns 4-kinase, localizes on Golgi membranes, and synergizes with PtdIns 4kinase in the formation of PtdIns 4-P. To construct an epitope tagged PITPnm, an XhoI site was introduced into the 5′ and 3′ ends of the full-length mouse PITPnm cDNA and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 Myc-His (Invitrogen Corp., arlsbad, CA). The XhoI-ClaI fragment (1.3 kilobases) was excised from full-length PITPnm cDNA and ligated into the pcDNA 3.1 Myc-His (designated Δ-(378–1242)) and also into the pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH Laboratories), respectively. The XhoI-BglII fragment (2.7 kilobases) was excised from full-length PITPnm cDNA and ligated into the pcDNA Myc-His (designated Δ-(707–1242)). A PITPα homology region of PITPnm (aa 1–257) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by using sense primers with an XhoI site at the 5′ end and antisense primers with a HindIII site at the 3′ end. The XhoI-HindIII fragment was gel-purified, digested with XhoI and HindIII, and then ligated into the pcDNA 3.1 Myc-His (designated Δ-(257–1242)). The full-length Myc-tagged construct was digested with PmaC1 and self-ligated (designated Δ-(64–475)). The expression vector, pSRE, encoding for FLAG-tagged type III PtdIns 4-kinase cDNA has been described previously (24Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (Sanko Junyaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). X63 and P19 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and α–minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum. The expression vectors described above were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The various truncated forms of GST-fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli by standard procedures. The cDNAs encoding recombinant protein I (aa 1–372) and IV (aa 1–257) were amplified by PCR using sense primers with an XhoI site at the 5′ end and antisense primers with a BamHI site at the 3′ end. Each fragment was excised with BamHI andXhoI and ligated into the pGEX 5X-1 vector.XhoI-EcoRI and EcoRI-EcoRI fragments, which encode the recombinant proteins II (aa 1–196) and III (aa 196–372), respectively, were ligated into pGEX 2T and pGEX 1λT. The mouse PITPα cDNA was cloned by PCR using mouse spleen cDNA libraries as template and the previously described primers (25Hara S. Swigart P. Jones D. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14908-14913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The positive clone was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, digested with NdeI/BamHI, and ligated into the pGEX 2T. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Fixed cells were permeabilized, and nonspecific reactive sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% skim milk. Cells were then incubated with affinity-purified polyclonal anti-PITPnm antibodies (18Aikawa Y. Hara H. Watanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or anti-c-Myc (9E10) antibody (Santa Cruz Biochemistry, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C. A monoclonal antibody to the Golgi 58-kDa protein (Sigma) was used to identify the Golgi vacuole. Antibodies were detected by CyTM3- or CyTM2-labeled goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). The coverslips were observed under confocal laser microscopy (Leica Laser Technik, Heidelberg, Germany). For subcellular fractionation, cells were swollen in homogenizing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted by Dounce homogenization. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h and separated into membrane and cytosol fractions. For alkaline extraction of the membrane fraction, the second membrane pellet obtained above was resuspended in 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11) and incubated on ice for 30 min as described previously (26Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shio H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The samples were repelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (27Fukami K. Sawada N. Endo T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2646-2650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was performed with the following modification. The various phosphoinositides (100 μg/well) dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:9) were coated onto 96-well multiplates and dried at 60 °C. The lipid-coated plates were blocked with 5% skim milk (w/v) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and various amounts of recombinant proteins were added to each well and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing the plates with PBS, antibody against GST was added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were then washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The interactions were visualized with the TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate System (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The lipid-protein co-sedimentation assay was performed as described previously (28Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W.

Briefly, protein samples were added to tubes containing lipid vesicles (100 μm total lipid concentration) and PBS in a final volume of 100 μl. Vesicles were made to contain increasing molar percentages of PtdIns (Sigma): (0% (100% PC), 1% (99% PC), 2.5% (97.5% PC), 5% (95% PC), 10% (90% PC)) or the indicated concentrations of PtdIns 4-P or PtdIns 4,5-P2 (Sigma). After incubation for 30 min, the lipid vesicles were precipitated by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The distribution of the recombinant proteins between the supernatant and pellet fractions was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Densitometric analysis was performed on the stained gel. PtdIns 4-kinase activity was assayed as described previously (24Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with the following modification. Briefly, the reaction mixture (100 μl/assay) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mg/ml sonicated PtdIns. The reaction was started by adding 50 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 37 °C and stopped by addition of 160 μl of 1 n HCl. The lipid was extracted with 320 μl of 1:1 (v/v) chloroform:methanol. The organic layer was analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on a silica gel plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The TLC plate was stained with iodine to identify the lipid spots, and the radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting after excision of the spots corresponding to PtdIns 4-P. A similar protocol was employed for assaying PtdIns 4-kinase activity, with the exception that the assay buffer did not include exogenous PtdIns or Triton X-100. Transfected COS-7 cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA) with protease inhibitors, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and aprotinin. Lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysates were precleared by incubation with 0.1% albumin-coated protein G-Sepharose beads. The supernatants were divided and incubated for 2 h with a monoclonal anti-FLAG-M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.), anti-c-Myc antibody, or control anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed five times with the lysis buffer. Cells were collected and washed twice with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). The cell pellets were fixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 2% paraformaldehyde in a buffer containing 4% sucrose. After dehydration in a graded series of ethanol solutions, the samples were embedded in LR Gold resin (London Resin Company Ltd., Berkshire, UK) at −20 °C and sectioned. The sections were mounted on nickel grids, blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 40 min, and then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with an appropriate dilution of affinity-purified anti-PITPnm primary antibody. Sections were subsequently incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 10 nm gold particles (British BioCell International, Cardiff, UK) diluted 1:100. After staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, the sections were observed in a JEM-1200 EX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 100 kV. The PITPnm protein contains a PITPα homology domain at the amino terminus (aa 1–257), an acidic domain (aa 341–362), and six putative membrane-spanning domains (wild type in Fig.1 A). To confirm that PITPnm is an intrinsic membrane protein, the full-length cDNA coding for mouse PITPnm was inserted into the pcDNA Myc-His expression vector and transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. The level of expression of PITPnm protein was assessed using affinity-purified polyclonal anti-PITPnm antibody. Fig. 1 B shows immunoblots for PITPnm protein in the lysates from control mock-transfected COS-7 cells, full-length PITPnm-transfected COS-7 cells, X63 mouse myeloma cells, and P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells. The affinity-purified antibody against mouse PITPnm recognized only one major band with an apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa in the lysate from COS-7 cells transfected with the full-length PITPnm cDNA expression vector. A band of the same size was also detected in the lysates from X63 and P19 cells, indicating that the recombinant PITPnm possesses the same molecular weight as endogenous PITPnm (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether endogenous PITPnm in P19 cells is a peripheral or an integral membrane protein, the membrane fractions were alkaline-extracted to remove peripheral membrane proteins. The membrane fractions obtained after a high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g) were subjected to high pH (0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.3) or high salt (1 m NaCl) extraction. Under these conditions both the endogenous and transfected PITPnm were found exclusively in the pellet fractions (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, the deletion mutant, the Δ-(258–1242) (Fig.1 A), which lacks the acidic and whole membrane domains of PITPnm, was detected as a 33-kDa protein present in the cytosolic fraction under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1 E). These results indicate that PITPnm is an integral membrane protein with its carboxyl terminus anchored in the lipid bilayer. To further discern the intracellular localization of the PITPnm, immunofluorescence studies were performed using confocal laser microscopy. COS-7 cells transiently expressing Myc-tagged full-length PITPnm cDNA were stained with anti-PITPnm antibodies and/or with anti-c-Myc antibodies. The anti-PITPnm antibody did not stain nontransfected cells (Fig.2 A). Immunoreactive transfected cells accounted for approximately 15–20% of the total cells, and the anti-PITPnm and anti-Myc antibodies yielded identical staining patterns (Fig. 2, B and C). Both antibodies revealed reticular staining pattern near the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, which is a characteristic of ER localization. In addition, of note, a clear juxtanuclear labeling pattern reminiscent of the Golgi complex was observed. To confirm this possibility, P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were doubly stained with anti-PITPnm antibody and anti-Golgi 58 K protein antibody. In this staining, complete co-localization was observed (Fig. 2 F). The immunoreactive products were densely aggregated in the form of caps in juxtaposition to the nuclei, which is the labeling pattern of the Golgi vacuoles (Fig. 2, D and E), suggesting that the majority of the endogenous PITPnm may be present in Golgi vacuoles. In contrast, the Δ-(258–1242) mutant was detected not only in Golgi vacuoles (Fig. 1 A), but also diffusely throughout the cytoplasm (data not shown). This is consistent with the results of subfractionation of the lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with the Δ-(258–1242) of PITPnm (Fig. 1 E). By immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 3), the immunoreactive protein was restricted to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane of Golgi vacuoles (Fig. 3 A, arrows) and rough ER (Fig. 3, B and C,arrows). To determine the orientation of the amino-terminal end of the PITPnm in Golgi vacuoles, a rabbit antibody that specifically recognized the amino-terminal region (aa 260–372) was used for staining. These results indicate that the amino-terminal portion of the PITPnm protein is exposed to cytoplasmic surface but not to the lumen. In addition, the labeled PITPnm was also found in vesicles; however the nucleus and mitochondria were not labeled (data not shown). No specific gold labeling was observed in samples stained with rabbit preimmune serum or stained only with gold-conjugated secondary antibody. In summary, the morphological data confirm that PITPnm is localized to the membrane of the Golgi vacuoles, ER, and vesicles and that the amino-terminal region of PITPnm is exposed to cytoplasmic surface. To test whether the amino-terminal region of PITPnm, which is homologous to soluble PITPα, is able to bind phosphoinositides, the lipid-protein interaction was examined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a lipid-protein co-sedimentation assay. Expression vectors encoding for four different truncated GST fusion proteins (I-IV) of PITPnm and the GST fusion protein of PITPα were constructed (Fig. 4 A). These proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified (Fig.4 B). In vitro lipid-binding activities of these recombinant proteins were determined using PtdIns, PtdIns 4-P, and PtdIns 4,5-P2 (Fig. 4 C). As a positive control, binding activity of the mouse PITPα was also measured. Recombinant proteins I (aa 1–378), III (aa 196–372), and IV (aa 1–257) bound avidly to PtdIns, PtdIns 4-P, and PtdIns 4,5-P2. Binding activities reached a plateau at 15 μg/well protein, while protein II (aa 1–195) and control GST protein alone did not bind to the lipids. These data indicated that the residues 196–257 of PITPnm comprise a binding site for PtdIns, PtdIns 4-P, and PtdIns 4,5-P2 and that binding affinity is similar to that of soluble PITPα. The binding activity of these recombinant proteins to phosphoinositides was also independently confirmed using a lipid-protein co-sedimentation assay (Fig. 4 D). Densitometric analysis of recombinant proteins in lipid-bound (pellet) and lipid-unbound (supernatant) fractions was performed on the stained gel. Specific binding of the PITPα and recombinant protein I to PtdIns, PtdIns 4-P, and PtdIns 4,5-P2 was observed with increasing molar percentage of phosphoinositides relative to PC as a control, supporting the previous report that PITPα has binding affinity for PtdIns 4,5-P2micelles (31van Paridon P.A. Gadella Jr., T.W.J. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 943: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein III and IV also bound to these vesicles (data not shown). In contrast, protein II and the control GST protein alone showed little or no binding activity. These results are consistent with that of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PITPnm binds PtdIns, which is a substrate for PtdIns 4-kinase (Fig. 4, C and D), and the amino-terminal residues (aa 1–257) of PITPnm are more than 46% identical to those of mouse PITPα. Therefore it was important to investigate whether PITPnm interacts with PtdIns 4-kinase. Although multiple PtdIns 4-kinases exist in mammalian cells (32Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar), it has been reported that type III PtdIns 4-kinase is localized on the Golgi membrane (24Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA 3 vector containing Myc-tagged PITPnm and a pSRE vector containing FLAG-tagged type III PtdIns 4-kinase cDNAs. The cells were then solubilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-FLAG or anti-c-Myc antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-c-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5 B, full-length PITPnm-Myc protein and PtdIns 4-kinase-FLAG protein were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG and anti-c-Myc antibodies, respectively, indicating that the full-length PITPnm protein associated with PtdIns 4-kinase. Furthermore, both PITPnm and PtdIns 4-kinase appeared to accumulate mainly in Golgi vacuoles (Fig. 2,G–I). These results strongly suggest that PITPnm associates with type III PtdIns 4-kinase on the Golgi membranes in vivo. To define the region of PITPnm that mediates the association with PtdIns 4-kinase, we constructed four deletion mutants of Myc-tagged PITPnm (Fig. 5 A). These deletion mutant cDNAs were co-transfected into COS-7 cells together with PtdIns 4-kinase FLAG-tagged cDNAs. The expression of these mutants was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5 B). Two PITPnm deletion mutants, Δ-(258–1242) and Δ-(65–474), did not immunoprecipitate any bands detectable with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5 C,b and d), while two other PITPnm deletion mutants, the Δ-(708–1242) and Δ-(379–1242), did so (Fig.5 C, c and e). Because the Δ-(379–1242) mutant had the same molecular size as that of immunoglobulin heavy chain, a GFP-tagged mutant protein was used instead of Myc-tagged protein. Taken together, these results indicate that both the PITPα homology region and acidic domain in the PITPnm are required for forming a complex with type III PtdIns 4-kinasein vitro. The localization of these PITPnm deletion mutants was also investigated (Table I). The truncated proteins lacking the membrane-spanning region did not localize to the Golgi vacuoles, but the Δ-(708–1242) was partially localized there. These results indicate that the transmembrane and carboxyl-terminal luminal domain are required for the Golgi vacuole localization. In fact, the complete transmembrane domain (aa 405–1242)-GFP tagged protein completely localized on the Golgi (data not shown).Table ILocalization of PITPnm and its various deletion mutant molecules on Golgi vacuole and their interaction with type III PtdIns 4-kinaseInteraction with type III PtdIns 4-kinaseLocalization on Golgi vacuolesWild type++Δ-(258–1242)−−Δ-(379–1242)+−Δ-(65–474)−−Δ-(708–1242)+±a±, Δ-(708–1242)-Myc-tagged proteins were partially localized on the Golgi vacuoles.a ±, Δ-(708–1242)-Myc-tagged proteins were partially localized on the Golgi vacuoles. Open table in a new tab To examine further the involvement of PITPnm in phosphoinositides synthesis, we determined PtdIns 4-kinase activity in the PITPnm immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6). A cDNA from the full-length PITPnm and other PITPnm deletion mutants were transfected into COS-7 cells. Cell lysates from each transfectant were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc and subjected to a PtdIns 4-kinase assay (Fig. 6 A). PtdIns 4-kinase activity was detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates of the full-length PITPnm, the Δ-(708–1242) and the Δ-(379–1242) in the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100, indicating that these proteins could interact with endogenous PtdIns 4-kinase in COS-7 cells. The cDNAs encoding the full-length PITPnm or other deletion mutants was co-transfected into COS-7 cells with type III PtdIns 4-kinase cDNA. Anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were subjected to the PtdIns 4-kinase assay in the presence of exogenous PtdIns and Triton X-100. The PtdIns 4-kinase activity was detected in anti-"

Studies in vertebrates indicate that the vasculature is the first organ system to develop and to function during embryogenesis and that formation of blood vessels is required for the normal development of other organ systems. In the adult organism, formation of de novo blood vessels is required in several physiological conditions including wound healing and regeneration of the female reproductive system and in pathological conditions such as the growth of solid tumors and metastases (1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Embryological studies indicate that blood vessels develop through two distinct mechanisms, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Vasculogenesis consists of the in situ differentiation of endothelial cells from mesoderm-derived precursors termed angioblasts, with the subsequent assembly of differentiated cells into blood vessels (2Pardanaud L. Altmann C. Kitos P. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Buck C.A. Development. 1987; 100: 339-349PubMed Google Scholar). Angiogenesis represents the formation of new blood vessels through sprouting and branching of endothelial cells from pre-existing vessels (3Noden D.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The expression of specific molecules on the surface of endothelial cells allows these cells to regulate the vascular developmental process through interaction with ligands produced by periendothelial mesenchymal cells. VEGF-R2 (flk1), the first of these receptors to be expressed, binds vascular endothelial growth factor and is required for the earliest stages of endothelial cell differentiation to initiate the process of vasculogenesis (4Quinn T.P.

VEGF-R1 (flt1), also a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor, plays a role in later stages of vasculogenesis including the assembly of differentiated endothelial cells into vascular channels (6Breier G.

Although significant progress has been made in determining the role of endothelial cell surface molecules in the process of vascular development, very little is known of the transcriptional pathways that regulate the expression of these molecules and thus coordinate fundamental events leading to blood vessel formation. To elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the expression of endothelial developmental genes, we took advantage of in vivo transcription studies conducted on the TIE2 promoter in transgenic mice.

These data indicate the presence of important cis-acting regulatory elements within the 223-bp enhancer region, being required for the cell-specific expression of TIE2 in embryonic endothelial cells. In this report, we demonstrate that a consensus octamer element (ATTTGCAT) contained within the 223-bp region is required for in vivo cell-specific enhancer activity in endothelial cells. DNA-protein binding studies indicate that the octamer element exhibits an endothelial cell-specific pattern of binding and that the cell-specific complex consists of the ubiquitous factor Oct1 and an endothelial cell-specific cofactor that is distinct from the B-cell cofactor Bob1/OCA-B/OBF-1. Our data suggest that the interaction of the Oct1-cofactor complex with the consensus octamer element is likely to mediate the expression of theTIE2 gene in endothelial cells. These results show a central role for the octamer element in regulating TIE2 expression and in mediating the development of the vascular system during embryogenesis. kilobase(s) electrophoretic mobility shift assay bovine aortic endothelial cells yolk sac cells base pair(s) embryonic day n 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside fetal bovine serum We have previously reported on the cloning of the promoter and 5′-flanking region of the murine TIE2 gene (12Fadel B.M. Boutet S.C. Quertermous T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For DNA sequencing, the 223-bp SacI-SphI region was subcloned into a pGL2 basic vector, and dideoxy chain termination sequencing was performed using Sequenase 2.0 according to the manufacturer's instructions (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Three separate DNA constructs were used to generate transgenic mice, TIE2.wt.LacZ, TIE2.2Octmut.LacZ, and TIE2.1Octmut.LacZ. The TIE2.wt.LacZ construct consists of 2.1 kb of murine TIE2 regulatory sequence (which encompasses the 223-bp region) including 1.8 kb of 5′-flanking sequence and 318 bp of 5′-untranslated region subcloned upstream of the LacZ gene containing a nuclear localization sequence. The TIE2.2Octmut.LacZ vector is identical to the TIE2.wt.LacZ except for point mutations introduced in both consensus and atypical octamer sites (ATTTGCAT →GCTTGCAT and ATGCTAAT → ATGCTAGC). The TIE2.1Octmut.LacZ vector contains point mutations only in the consensus octamer site (ATTTGCAT → GCTTGCAT). The TIE2.wt.LacZ was generated by subcloning the LacZ gene from PPD46.21 containing a nuclear localization signal into theHindIII-NotI sites of pKS-Bluescript (Stratagene). The 2.1-kb HindIII-HindIII fragment of TIE2 was then subcloned in the same vector to generate pKS.TIE2.wt.LacZ. Digestion of this vector with SalI andNotI liberated the transgene cassette TIE2.wt.LacZ. Site-directed mutagenesis of the octamer elements was introduced using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate TIE2.2Octmut.LacZ and TIE2.1Octmut.LacZ. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The TIE2.wt.LacZ, TIE2.2Octmut.LacZ, and TIE2.1 Octmut.LacZ constructs were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by Geneclean (Bio 101). Each DNA was then suspended in injection buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA) and passed through a 0.45-μl filter (Millipore). Microinjection into oocytes and surgical procedures were performed as described previously (13). The morning following the appearance of the vaginal plug was designated day 0.5 postcoitus. Pregnant mice were sacrificed at 9.5 days of embryonic development (E9.5), and the embryo, the yolk sac, and decidua were isolated. To genotype embryos, polymerase chain reaction amplification of 340 bp of the LacZ gene was performed on yolk sac tissue using the primers 5′-TACCACAGCGGATGGTTCGG-3′ and 5′-GTGGTGGTTATGCCGATCGC-3′ under the following conditions: 1) denaturation at 94 °C for 1.5 min; 2) denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 54 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min for a total of 30 cycles; and 3) final extension at 72 °C for 10 min (13). Polymerase chain reaction buffer consisted of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% (v/v) gelatin. Amplification products were separated on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. For whole mount LacZ staining, embryos were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 30 min in 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, and rinsed three times in a solution containing 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (13). Embryos were stained in a rinse solution containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 5 mmK3Fe(CN)6, and 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6 for a period of 4 h. Embryos were then mounted in paraffin, sectioned, deparaffinized, rehydrated, counterstained with nuclear fast red (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), dehydrated, mounted in Permount (Fisher), and photographed under darkfield or brightfield microscopy. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the various cell types according to the method described by Schreiber et al. (14Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were harvested as described previously and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Murine yolk sac cells (YSC) were supplied by Progenitor Inc. (Menlo Park, CA) and grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 18% (v/v) FBS, leukemia inhibitory factor, β-mercaptoethanol, and gentamycin (15Corn B.J. Reed M.A. Dishong S.L. Li Y. Wagner T.E. Clin. Biotech. 1991; 3: 15-19Google Scholar). Namalwa (Human Burkitt lymphoma), HeLa, and myoblast cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Namalwa cells were grown in suspension in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) FBS, HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, and myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 18% (v/v) FBS. All cell culture supplies were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Synthetic oligonucleotides used in this study include the consensus octamer oligo, 5′-GAATTTCAGATGCAAATTTATATAC-3′ and its compliment and the atypical octamer oligo 5′-GATGAAATGCTAATAAAAATTAAA-3′ and its compliment. For preparation of DNA probes, oligos were annealed and labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase, whereas the 223-bp region was excised from the plasmid vector, dephosphorylated, and then end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). For EMSA, binding conditions consisted of 40 mm NaCl, 27 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.75 mm dithiothreitol, 4% (v/v) Ficoll, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 20 ng/μl herring sperm DNA (16). 6 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the binding buffer. 100–200 pg of labeled oligos and, when indicated, 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligos were added, and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for an additional 20 min. For supershift assays, 3 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-Oct1 antibody, anti-Bob1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit IgG were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min at room temperature using the same conditions described above prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotides. Samples were then loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 1 × Tris/glycine buffer at 200 V for 5 h at 4 °C. Poly(A+) RNA from BAEC, YSC, HeLa, Namalwa, and erythroleukemia cells were obtained using the Micro-FastTrack kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After electrophoresis on a formaldehyde gel, RNA was transferred to a Magna Charge membrane (Micron Separations, Inc.), baked for 2 h at 80 °C, and linked using a UV cross-linker (Stratagene). The membrane was then prehybridized for 4 h at 37 °C, hybridized with a full-length human Bob1 cDNA probe (generously provided by Drs. Walter Schaffner and Oleg Georgiev, University of Zurich, Switzerland), and labeled using the Prime-it Random Primer Labeling kit (Stratagene). After washing twice at room temperature and once at 37 °C under low stringency conditions (2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS), the membrane was subjected overnight to autoradiography at −80 °C. The membrane was then stripped and rehybridized with a human cyclophilin DNA probe. Experiments employing reporter transgenes in mice have indicated that a 223-bp regulatory region located between −760 and −537 bp is essential for high level specific expression of the murine TIE2 gene in endothelial cells of the mouse embryo (11Schlaeger T.M. Qin Y. Fujiwara Y. Magram J. Sato T.N. Development. 1995; 121: 1089-1098PubMed Google Scholar). To guide studies aimed at investigating the cis-acting DNA elements that mediate cell-specific enhancer activity, we first evaluated this minimal region for the presence of known DNA binding sites. DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of three putative binding sites for transcription factors: a consensus octamer element 5′-ATTTGCAT-3′ (complementary sequence being 5′-ATGCAAAT-3′) at −669 bp, a CCAAT motif at −653 bp, and an atypical octamer element 5′-ATGCTAAT-3′ at −574 bp (Fig. 1). The atypical octamer element differs from the consensus sequence by the presence of a T instead of an A in the fifth position, and both octamer elements are known to bind members of the POU domain family of transcription factors (17Cepek K.L. Chasman D.I. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2079-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Several of these factors regulate important developmental events in the vertebrate embryo. Examples include the terminal differentiation of B-cells mediated by Oct2, the development of the hypothalamus mediated by Brn2 and the determination of the somatotrope, lactotrope, and thyrotrope lineages in the pituitary gland by Pit-1 (18Corcoran L.M. Karvelas M. Nossal G.J. Ye Z.S. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated whether the octamer elements contained in the TIE2 enhancer region are required for the expression of this vascular developmental gene in embryonic endothelial cells. To determine whether the octamer elements may function as endothelial cell enhancers for TIE2, we evaluated the expression of LacZ in transgenic mice under the control of a wild type or mutant TIE2 enhancer region (Fig.2). The wild type construct (TIE2.wt.LacZ) consisted of the LacZ gene containing a nuclear localization signal cloned downstream of the 2.1-kb TIE2sequence. The double mutant construct (TIE2.2Octmut.LacZ) is identical to the wild type construct except that point mutations were introduced in both octamer elements to prevent interaction with octamer binding proteins. The TIE2 regulatory region used to generate these constructs differs from the one used by Schlaeger et al. (11Schlaeger T.M. Qin Y. Fujiwara Y. Magram J. Sato T.N. Development. 1995; 121: 1089-1098PubMed Google Scholar). Both sequences have a common 3′ end at a HindIII site located at +318 bp; however, our construct extends further upstream to aHindIII site located at −1.8 kb instead of −0.9 kb. Because the TIE2 enhancer mediates reporter transgene expression only in embryonic endothelial cells and because nativeTIE2 expression begins at approximately E8.0, we analyzed LacZ expression in embryos at E9.5 as previously done (11Schlaeger T.M. Qin Y. Fujiwara Y. Magram J. Sato T.N. Development. 1995; 121: 1089-1098PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sato T.N. Qin Y. Kozak C.A. Audus K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9355-9358Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Of the first generation embryos carrying the wild type construct, 38% did incorporate the transgene as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction of yolk sac tissue using LacZ-specific primers. Of these transgenic embryos, 44% demonstrated strong LacZ staining that is restricted to endothelial cells (TableI). Endothelial cells of the dorsal aorta, branchial arch arteries, intersomitic arteries, vitelline artery, cardinal veins, sinus venosus, the endocardium of the common atrium and ventricle, outflow tract, and yolk sac stained positively (Fig. 3). Although the intensity and extent of LacZ expression varied slightly among the transgenic embryos, all those that stained demonstrated strong endothelial expression, and none showed evidence of ectopic nonendothelial staining. Overall, most embryonic endothelial cells stained positively for LacZ, and these findings agree with the study reported by Schlaeger et al.(11Schlaeger T.M. Qin Y. Fujiwara Y. Magram J. Sato T.N. Development. 1995; 121: 1089-1098PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, LacZ expression in endothelial cells was not uniform, and expression was also weaker and more patchy in the ventricular endocardium as compared with the aorta and atrial endocardium. Taken together, these data indicate that the 2.1-kb regulatory region of TIE2 contains DNA elements that can provide cell-specific expression of the TIE2 promoter in embryonic endothelial cells.Table ISummary of the activity of the wild type and mutant TIE2/LacZ constructs in transgenic mouse embryos at E9.5Total number of embryosNumber of transgenic embryosEmbryos showing LacZ stainingWild type construct (TIE2.wt.LacZ)4216 (38% of total)7 (44% of transgenic)Double mutant construct (TIE2.2Octmut.LacZ)6226 (42% of total)11 (42% of transgenic)Single mutant construct (TIE2.1Octmut.LacZ)6610 (15% of total)6 (60% of transgenic) Open table in a new tab Transgenic embryos carrying the double mutant construct (TIE2.2Octmut.LacZ) were collected and analyzed in a manner identical to the wild type construct embryos. A similar percentage of these embryos demonstrated evidence of LacZ staining (42%) as compared with the wild type embryos (Table I). However, the pattern and intensity of LacZ expression in the embryos carrying the double mutant construct markedly differed from those with the wild type construct. In the embryos that showed evidence of β-galactosidase expression, staining was patchy and weak and mostly limited to few endothelial cells in the entire embryo (Fig. 4). In particular, endothelial cells in the aorta, intersomitic arteries, and atrial endocardium that showed strong staining with the wild type construct did not stain or showed weak staining limited to a few cells. Of interest was the absence of a particular pattern of LacZ expression in these embryos. Some embryos showed LacZ staining in a few endothelial cells within the aorta or in the intersomitic arteries; others showed staining only in the yolk sac or in the cardinal veins (Fig. 4). Of 11 mutant construct embryos that stained positively for LacZ, a single embryo demonstrated strong staining in the aorta and endocardium; however, the number of stained endothelial cells was significantly less than that for the wild type construct embryos. These data show that mutation of the octamer elements markedly impairs reporter gene expression and ablates most of the enhancer activity in endothelial cells. Because the consensus octamer element is known to mediate cell-specific enhancer activity in other cell lineages such as B lymphocytes, we examined whether this element, rather than the atypical octamer motif, mediates endothelial cell enhancer activity of TIE2. Transgenic embryos carrying point mutations only in this element (TIE2.1Octmut.LacZ) were examined as described above. These embryos exhibited LacZ expression that is strikingly similar to the pattern seen with the double mutant construct (Fig.5). In particular, none of the embryos demonstrated any significant endothelial cell staining, and LacZ expression was uniformly very weak and patchy, mostly limited to few endothelial cells in the whole embryo. Similar to the embryos carrying the double mutant construct, there was no particular pattern of LacZ staining, with all the stained embryos showing weak and very limited staining in the intersomitic arteries or the aorta. These findings indicate that the consensus octamer element is required for normal expression of TIE2 in embryonic endothelial cells and is the DNA element that mediates most if not all of the endothelial cell enhancer activity of the TIE2 promoter. To investigate the mechanisms by which the consensus octamer element mediates endothelial cell-specific expression and to obtain a correlation with the in vivo functional studies, we conducted a series of DNA-protein interaction experiments. As a first step, a DNA fragment spanning the entire 223-bp enhancer region was radiolabeled and employed in standard EMSA (16). Nuclear extracts were prepared from a cultured YSC line derived from the murine yolk sac tissue at approximately 8.5 days of embryonic development (15Corn B.J. Reed M.A. Dishong S.L. Li Y. Wagner T.E. Clin. Biotech. 1991; 3: 15-19Google Scholar). These cells serve as a model of embryonic endothelial cells because they express endothelial markers such as flk1 andTIE2 and are able to form microvascular-like tubular structures in culture (20Hidai C. Zupancic T. Penta K. Mikhail A. Kawana M. Quertermous E.E. Aoka Y. Fukagawa M. Matsui Y. Platika D. Auerbach R. Hogan B.L.M. Snodgrass R. Quertermous T.

A. 1995; 92: 8763-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). EMSA employing extracts from these cells revealed a single retarded complex, indicating that the 223-bp DNA sequence is capable of binding protein (Fig.6). The retarded complex was competed when excess unlabeled DNA was included in the reaction, indicating specificity of the DNA-protein interaction. Unlabeled oligonucleotides encoding the consensus octamer element were able to fully compete for binding to the DNA fragment, whereas those encoding the atypical octamer element were not. The data suggest that a protein binding sequence is contained within the 223-bp region of the TIE2gene and that this sequence is the consensus octamer element. These findings are in agreement with the results obtained in our transgenic studies. Because the consensus octamer was able to compete for protein binding to the 223-bp region, we investigated its pattern of binding to a number of endothelial and nonendothelial cell extracts. For this purpose, EMSA were employed using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe spanning the octamer element in conjunction with nuclear extracts derived from three endothelial and three nonendothelial cell types. Endothelial cells included YSC, BAEC, and murine hemangioendothelioma cells. Nonendothelial cells included Namalwa B-cells, HeLa cells, and myoblasts. The three endothelial cell types showed two specific retarded bands, complex A and B, whereas the three nonendothelial cell types showed only one of the retarded bands, complex A (Fig. 7). This suggests that complex B, the more slowly migrating of the two bands, is likely to result from the specific interaction between the octamer element and protein factor(s) present exclusively in endothelial cell extracts. These findings correlate with our in vivo data and suggest a mechanism for endothelial cell-specific expression that is mediated by the consensus octamer element. A series of experiments were conducted to characterize the nature of the endothelial cell-specific band noted on EMSA. For this purpose, EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts derived from BAEC and Namalwa B-cells and a labeled oligo spanning the consensus octamer element in the presence of anti-Oct1 antibodies (Fig. 8). Because complex A is seen with all the cell lines used in EMSA, we hypothesized that it may represent the binding of the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Oct1 to the octamer element. This was confirmed by the addition of anti-Oct1 antibodies, which resulted in a supershift of complex A in both BAEC and Namalwa cells (lanes 2 and6). Furthermore, the addition of anti-Oct1 antibodies but not control IgG also resulted in the supershift of the endothelial cell-specific band, complex B (lane 2). Because the anti-Oct1 antibodies recognize a 20-amino acid epitope that is specific to Oct1 and not shared by other known members of the POU domain family of transcription factors (22Xie Q. J. Biol.

The addition of control IgG did not affect either complex A or complex B (lane 4). Oct1 is well known to make protein-protein interactions with a number of transcription factors. Most of these factors including Sp-1, Ap-1, PTF, and the steroid receptors have a wide pattern of expression (26Janson L. Pettersson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the other hand, we have shown that CP, at physiological concentrations, inhibits the endothelium-dependent relaxation of rabbit aorta induced by agonists and that this effect is not due to a trapping of NO by the copper sites (18Cappelli-Bigazzi M. Ambrosio G. Musci G. Battaglia C. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Golino P. Ragni M. Chiariello M. Calabrese L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2843-H2849PubMed Google Scholar). Vasodilation requires a (NO)-cGMP transduction pathway between endothelium and smooth muscle cells (19Furchgott R.F. Zawadzki J.V.

After agonist stimulation evoking an increase in the [Ca2+]i concentration, Ca2+-bound calmodulin disrupts the inhibitory eNOS-caveolin-1 interactions (24Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol.

The agonist bradykinin (Bk) has a distinct role among vasodilators because it has also been shown that its receptor physically associates with eNOS (28Ju H. Venema V.J. Marrero M.B. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24025-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this context, it should be recalled that a regulatory role for dietary copper in the control of vascular functions has been assessed by numerous studies focused mainly on copper deficiency-induced defects of vessels and on the impairment of NO-mediated vasodilation under copper restriction (reviewed in Ref. 29Schuschke D.A. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 2274-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the contrary, an ability of copper ions (Cu2+) to relax vessels seems well established. It has been shown that copper enhances the relaxation of precontracted aortic rings evoked by the calcium ionophore A23187 and sodium nitroprusside (30Plane F. Wigmore S. Angelini G.D. Jeremy J.Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and it also elevates intracellular cGMP levels and induces relaxation of pulmonary arterial rings (31Ohnishi T. Ishizaki T. Sasaki F. Ameshima S. Nakai T. Miyabo S. Matsukawa S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 319: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that copper induces the activation of eNOS in cultured endothelial cells (32Demura Y. Ameshima S. Ishizaki T. Okamura S. Miyamori I. Matsukawa S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), an event supposed to occurin vivo in hypercupremic states induced by Cu2+released by ceruloplasmin. This result is apparently in contrast with our previous findings (18Cappelli-Bigazzi M. Ambrosio G. Musci G. Battaglia C. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Golino P. Ragni M. Chiariello M. Calabrese L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2843-H2849PubMed Google Scholar), which are in better accordance with the inhibitory effects exerted by divalent metal ions on eNOS (32Demura Y. Ameshima S. Ishizaki T. Okamura S. Miyamori I. Matsukawa S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Howard A.B. Alexander R.W. Taylor W.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C612-C618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as on neuronal nitric oxide synthase (34Quinn M.R. Harris C.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 196: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), another constitutive enzyme, when activity measurements are performed on crude cell extracts or on the purified enzyme (35Persechini A. McMillan K. Siler Master B.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15091Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of CP on the relaxation of rabbit aortic vessels (18Cappelli-Bigazzi M. Ambrosio G. Musci G. Battaglia C. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Golino P. Ragni M. Chiariello M. Calabrese L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2843-H2849PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether this protein could affect the agonist-induced activation of eNOS in cultured OAECs. Here we show that exogenously added CP reversibly reduces the formation of cGMP, nitrite, and citrulline but not Ca2+mobilization in endothelial cells stimulated with agonists, with a time course consistent with that of copper delivery to cells, and we show that copper bound to histidine, but not free ionic copper, mimics the effect of CP. Altogether, the results are consistent with a mechanism whereby intracellular, CP-derived copper inhibits eNOS activation by agonists. All reagents were purchased from Sigma Italia (Milan, Italy) unless otherwise noted and were used without further purification. Radioactive chemicals were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Milan, Italy). OAECs were harvested from the internal surface of aortas according to a previously described procedure (36Gospodarowicz D. Moran J. Braun D. Birdwell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4120-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) using collagenase XI and grown in a culture medium containing DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies, Inc.), 30 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma Italia), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Their identity was verified by their morphological features and immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to factor VIII. The confluent monolayers were subcultured by conventional trypsinization. For the present study, cells were used at the third to sixth passages. Stimulation by agonists was carried out with confluent cells in either modified Hanks' balanced salt solution (m-HBSS), serum-free DMEM, or DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (DMEM/FBS). To remove possible traces of thrombin, all CP samples were treated with benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) immediately before addition to cells. Sheep and human CP were purified as described previously (2Musci G. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Fagiolo U. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13388-13392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Calabrese L. Carbonaro M. Musci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6183-6187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified by mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography to remove traces of prothrombin. The resulting proteins were >99% pure as judged by spectroscopic and electrophoretic analyses. In some experiments, purified CP samples were treated with Chelex 100 (38Ehrenwald E. Chisolm G.M. Fox P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Apoceruloplasmin (ApoCP) was prepared as described previously (39Musci G. Di Marco S. Bellenchi G.C. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1972-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ApoCP had a residual oxidase activity of ∼10% with respect to the native protein, consistent with the presence of ∼10% unremoved copper. Neutralization of CP with anti-CP antibody was carried out by preincubating CP on ice for 30 min with a 2-fold excess of a polyclonal specific anti-sheep ceruloplasmin antibody (generous gift of Dr. Marmocchi) before the treatment of cells. To determine [cGMP]ilevels in cultured OAECs, cells were preincubated in complete DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 with 1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, before treatment with effectors and/or agonists. At the end of the stimulation with the agonist (10 min), cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, with 0.5% Triton X-100. The lysate was collected in 1% perchloric acid and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Precipitated proteins were determined with either the biuret method (43Goa J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1953; 37: 218-223Crossref Scopus (794) Google Scholar) or the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce), whereas the supernatants were lyophilized and assayed for cGMP by radioimmunoassay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each experiment was performed in duplicate. Formation of nitrites in the medium was quantitated fluorimetrically with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene according to Misko (40Misko P.T. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Morre W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells in 100-mm dishes were stimulated in DMEM/FBS without phenol red, and the medium (2 ml) was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. 250 μl of a solution of 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (5 mg/100 ml in 0.62n HCl) were added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 20 °C in the dark. After the addition of 250 μl of 1.4 m NaOH, samples were filtered through a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filter (Iwaki, Japan), and the fluorescence was measured with λex = 375 nm and λem = 426 nm on a Perkin Elmer LS50-B spectrofluorimeter. A standard curve was constructed with a known concentration of sodium nitrite in the same medium. To measure total NOx (nitrite + nitrate), nitrates were first converted to nitrite by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C with 50 milliunits/ml nitrate reductase fromAspergillus sp. in the presence of 30 μmNADPH. Residual NADPH was oxidized by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C with lactic dehydrogenase (5 milliunits/ml) in the presence of 0.3 mm pyruvate. Measurements of total NOx were carried out using m-HBSS as the cell medium because DMEM contains micromolar levels of nitrate. eNOS activity in intact OAECs was assayed by measuring the intracellular formation of [3H]citrulline using the method of Hu and El-Fakahany (41Hu J. El-Fakahany E.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), modified as follows. Confluent cells grown in 6-well dishes were loaded with [3H]arginine by a 15-min incubation at 37 °C with DMEM/FBS containing 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm citrulline, and [3H]arginine (10 μCi/ml, 5 μCi/well, and 1 μCi/40 nmol total arginine). After an additional 15-min incubation with or without CP, cells were treated with agonists, washed twice with PBS containing 1 mm arginine, and lysed in cold absolute methanol. Proteins were assayed after quantitative recovery from the wells with 0.1 m NaOH. The methanol extracts were dried in a Jouan RC 10.22 Speedvac, and pellets were redissolved in 500 μl of H2O. Chromatographic separation of [3H]citrulline from [3H]arginine was achieved by batch incubation of the mixture for 10 min with 100 μl of a Dowex 50WX8 slurry under continuous mild agitation. Supernatants were counted for radioactivity to evaluate intracellular formation of [3H]citrulline. Values were normalized for the protein content of each well. The conversion of [3H]arginine into [3H]citrulline was also used to measure eNOS activity in OAEC homogenates, essentially as described by Hecker et al.(42Hecker M. Mulsch A. Bassenge E. Forstermann U. Busse R. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells were detached by gently scraping the culture dishes and resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 120 mm NaCl, 15 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/liter leupeptin, 10 μg/liter pepstatin, 10 μg/liter aprotinin, and 20 mm CHAPS. The suspension was homogenized in ice with a mini-potter apparatus and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. 20–50-μl aliquots of the supernatants were assayed for eNOS activity by the addition of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm NADPH, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 15 μm6R-tetrahydrobiopterin, 1 μm FAD, 1 μm FMN, 0.1 μm calmodulin, 10 μm arginine, and 5 μCi/ml [3H]arginine (total volume, 150 μl). After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the reaction was stopped with 5 volumes of 20 mm Hepes, pH 5.5, containing 10 mm EDTA. The mixture was loaded on a 1-ml column of Dowex 50WX8 pre-equilibrated in the latter buffer. The eluate was counted for radioactivity to evaluate the extent of [3H]citrulline formation. The effect of copper was assessed by adding increasing concentrations of CuCl2 to the homogenate 5 min before adding the cofactors. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, immunodetection was carried out with either anti-eNOS (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories) or anti-CP and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were incubated with the indicated amounts of CP or copper-histidine, prepared by adding 1 mol of CuCl2 to 3 mol of histidine in water, or CuCl2, in DMEM/FBS, DMEM or m-HBSS. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and either lysed in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.5% Triton X-100 to determine total copper content or collected by scraping and homogenized by 30 strokes in a mini-Potter apparatus in ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 120 mmNaCl, 15 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/liter leupeptin, 10 μg/liter pepstatin A, 10 μg/liter aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100. Copper content was determined on aliquots of lysates, homogenates, supernatants, and pellets after digestion with HNO3 by flameless atomic absorption (Perkin Elmer 3030 spectrometer equipped with graphite furnace). The data were normalized by dividing picomoles Cu by mg proteins. Proteins were determined using either the biuret method (43Goa J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1953; 37: 218-223Crossref Scopus (794) Google Scholar) or the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce). Cells were grown at confluence in chamber slides (Lab-Tek; Nunc, Naperville, IL) and treated with 4 μm fura 2-acetoxymethyl ester for 45 min at 37 °C to monitor variations of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations (44Wickham N.W.R. Vercellotti G.M. Moldow C.F. Visser M.R. Jacob H.S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1988; 112: 157-167PubMed Google Scholar). Emission fluorescence at 510 nm was measured upon excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm and expressed asF 340/F 380. Nitric-oxide synthase is activated in endothelial cells by several agonists including bradykinin and acetylcholine. Because this leads to NO-dependent activation of endothelial guanylate cyclase (45Mayer B. Schrammel A. Klatt P. Koesling D. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17355-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the rise of the intracellular cyclic GMP concentration, [cGMP]i, was used as an index of eNOS activity. Untreated OAECs have a basal level of cGMP that was not affected by CP (Fig. 1 A). Bk induced an approximately 6-fold increase of [cGMP]i that was abolished by inhibition of eNOS by 1 mml-NAME. When added to cells 15 min before stimulation, CP had a strong, dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the agonist-induced increase of cGMP levels, with a maximal effect at 10 μm concentration. The inhibition was already evident at 1 μm CP and required the native form, because copper-free CP had a small effect, the magnitude of which was accounted for by the presence of approximately 10% residual active holoprotein (see “Experimental Procedures”). Treatment of CP samples with Chelex 100 (38Ehrenwald E. Chisolm G.M. Fox P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) to remove loosely bound copper before the addition to cells had no effects on the results shown. Neutralization by a specific antibody substantially relieved the effect of 10 μm CP. By itself, the antibody affected neither the basal nor the bradykinin-stimulated levels of cGMP. To examine whether CP altered [cGMP]i through NO-independent routes rather than affecting eNOS catalytic activity, the eNOS activity was monitored using the conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline as a measure of NO synthase activity (Fig. 1 B). Stimulation of untreated cells by Bk produced a 3-fold enhancement of citrulline production, which was abolished by l-NAME. Preincubation of cells with CP before stimulation substantially reduced Bk-stimulated citrulline production in the same manner as that observed for cGMP production, indicating that the lower levels of [cGMP]iattained by cells stimulated in the presence of extracellular CP were indeed related to an inhibition of eNOS activity. Consistent with this finding, CP strongly hindered the release of NO in the medium. OAECs stimulated in m-HBSS for 10 min with 1 μm bradykinin produced ∼130 pmol/mg protein NOx (nitrite + nitrate), with over 80% of NOx accounted for by nitrite. Preincubation of cells with 10 μm CP for 15 min nearly abolished NOx production. Human CP was also effective in inhibiting the agonist-induced eNOS activation, being ∼80% as active as the ovine enzyme. The effect of CP was independent of the signaling pathway responsible for eNOS activation. As revealed by [cGMP]i(Fig. 1 C) and [3H]citrulline (Fig.1 D), CP exerted a strong inhibitory effect on the response of OAECs to acetylcholine or ADP and on the non-receptor-dependent response to the Ca2+ionophore A23187. Altogether, the data reported in Fig. 1,A-D, show that the effect of CP is independent of the agonist used to stimulate cells and of the product of eNOS activation that is monitored. The fact that similar end points are obtained with all tested agonists suggests that the effect of CP is exerted on the common target of all agonists, i.e. on eNOS itself. In agreement with the observation that aortic rings recover the capability to relax after the removal of CP (18Cappelli-Bigazzi M. Ambrosio G. Musci G. Battaglia C. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Golino P. Ragni M. Chiariello M. Calabrese L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2843-H2849PubMed Google Scholar), these cells were again found to be responsive to agonists upon the removal of CP and subsequent incubation in fresh medium. However, the results reported in Fig. 1 E show that cells that had been exposed to 10 μm CP need 30 min to recover full response to the agonist, either Bk or acetylcholine. The extent of inhibition of the agonist-induced activation of eNOS depended on the time of exposure of cells to CP. In Fig.2, the levels of [cGMP]i, intracellular [3H]citrulline, and nitrite in the medium are shown for cells stimulated with bradykinin at different times after the addition of 10 μm CP to the incubation medium. It should be noted that the indicated times actually encompassed the 10-min time period required for stimulation. It is evident that: (i) the first 15-min preincubation with CP caused an essentially complete (nearly 80%) inhibition of eNOS activity that remained at this level for more than ∼60 min, and (ii) a small inhibition occurred when CP was added simultaneously to bradykinin, i.e. zero time of preincubation. Moreover, no significant inhibition was found when CP was added 2 min after the agonist. This experiment was critical because it showed that CP had to be in contact with cells before the agonist in order to exert its effect and was nearly ineffective in suppressing the response of cells once a response had been evoked. It should be noted that the kinetics of formation of citrulline and nitrite (i.e. NO) are similar; however, they differ at short times from that of cGMP. The lag phase observed in the latter case could be explained when we consider that the formation of cGMP requires the secondary activation of guanylate cyclase. Because agonists activate eNOS through enhancing the free cytosolic calcium concentration, the next question was whether CP could interfere with calcium fluxes in endothelial cells. As indicated by a representative experiment (Fig. 3), theF 340/F 380 fluorescence intensity ratio, which increases upon elevation of [Ca2+]i, varied after stimulation of OAECs by bradykinin, independently of prior exposure of cells to CP. Similar results were also obtained with A23187, with the ionophore inducing only a bigger variation of the fluorescence intensity ratio (data not shown). It has been shown repeatedly that CP interacts directly with the membrane surface of cells of many tissues, including heart and aorta (46Stevens M.D. DiSilvestro R.A. Harris E.D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and that such interactions lead to a transmembrane transport of copper but not of the protein moiety (47Percival S.S. Harris E.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C140-C146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An enhanced metal exportation generally follows the increase of the intracellular concentration of copper in normal cells (48Dameron C.T. Harrison M.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67 Suppl. 5: 1091S-1097SCrossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 49Harris E.D. Qian Y. Tiffany-Castiglioni E. Lacy A.R. Reddy M.C. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67 Suppl. 5: 988S-995SCrossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To assess the possible effect on eNOS of a transient increase in copper levels, the delivery of copper to OAECs by CP was studied. CP affected the copper content of OAECs in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4). OAECs exposed to 10 μm CP accumulated copper for at least 60 min, with an almost 7-fold increase, after 60 min, with respect to that of untreated cells (Fig. 4 A). Copper uptake by a number of cell types has been the object of intensive investigation, which has also shown that the metal does not easily redistribute among cellular components when cells are homogenized (50Waldrop G. Ettinger M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G212-G218PubMed Google Scholar)."

These killer toxins are encoded by double-stranded RNA viruses in the cell cytoplasm (9Puhalla J.E. Genetics. 1968; 60: 461-474PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of an immunity or resistance gene, these toxins are lethal to the organism of origin and sometimes to closely related organisms but not to plant or animal cells. TheU. maydis strains P1, P4, and P6 secrete toxins KP1, KP4, and KP6, respectively, all of which are low molecular weight (∼100 amino acids) polypeptides (10Tao J. Ginsberg I. Banerjee N. Koltin Y.

The crystal structure of theU. maydis KP4 toxin (a single polypeptide chain of 105 amino acids) has been determined and shown to possess a α/β-sandwich fold (13Richardson J.S. Adv.

Ginsberg I. Banerjee N. Koltin Y. Held W. Bruenn J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The toxin is unique in that two polypeptide chains, KP6α and KP6β, are necessary for its killer activity (18Peery T. Shabat-Brand T. Steinlauf R. Koltin Y. Bruenn J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The 1234-base pair double-stranded RNA P6M2 codes for a pretoxin of 219 amino acids, which is post-translationally cleaved by two endopeptidases, yielding α- and β-subunits having 79 and 81 amino acids, respectively, as determined by cDNA sequence, N-terminal protein sequence analysis, and by mass spectroscopy. 2J. Bruenn, unpublished results. 2J. Bruenn, unpublished results. It has been proposed that the KP6 toxin may act by either interfering with the K+ channel or binding to its own membrane receptor (10Tao J. Ginsberg I. Banerjee N. Koltin Y. Held W. Bruenn J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,19Tao J. Ginsberg I. Koltin Y. Bruenn J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), thus depleting cellular K+ levels and eventually killing the cells. Here we present the crystal structure of the α-subunit of KP6 toxin determined by the isomorphous heavy atom replacement method and refined at a 1.80-Å resolution. We show that the symmetry-related trimeric or hexameric assembly of the subunit creates a central pore that could have functional implications. KP6α was purified to homogeneity as described previously (18Peery T. Shabat-Brand T. Steinlauf R. Koltin Y. Bruenn J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,20Steinlauf R. Peery T. Koltin Y. Bruenn J. Exp. Mycol. 1988; 12: 264-274Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The selenomethionine derivative was prepared by growing cells in a medium supplemented with 20 mg/ml selenomethionine. Native protein crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique (21Hampel A. Labananskas M. Conners P.G. Kirkegard L. RajBhandary U.L. Sigler P.B. Bock T.M. Science. 1968; 162: 1384-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hanging drops containing 5 μl of 10 mg/ml protein and 1 μl of 85% ammonium sulfate in 10 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, were equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution containing 18–21% ammonium sulfate in 10 mm MES buffer. Single crystals shaped as hexagonal rods having typical dimensions of 0.15 × 0.30 × 0.30 mm3 were obtained in about 20 days at room temperature. The crystal of the selenomethionine-substituted protein was obtained under the same conditions as the native crystal, but it took longer to grow to a size of 0.1 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3. The heavy atom derivative was prepared by soaking a single native crystal in 200 μl of 0.5 mm PIP (di-μ-iodobis(ethylenediamine)diplatinum(II) nitrate) solution in MES buffer, pH 6.0, for 36 days. Three room temperature data sets for native, platinum derivative, and selenomethionine-substituted protein crystals were collected with the in-house RAXIS IIc image plate area detector, receiving x-rays from a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA. Graphite-monochromated CuKα radiation was used. Crystals used for data collection were mounted in glass capillaries and sealed with mother liquor. One crystal was used for each of the data sets. The image plate detector was placed at 77.9, 120.0, and 130.3 mm from native, PIP derivative, and selenomethionine protein crystals, respectively, and the limiting resolutions for the three data sets were 1.8 Å, 2.2 Å, and 2.3 Å, respectively. The space group is P6322, and cell dimensions are a = b = 48.30 Å, c = 124.22 Å, with one molecule/asymmetric unit. The specific volume of the crystal is 2.41 Å3/Da, and the solvent content is about 42%. Data were processed using the DENZO program and scaled and merged using the SCALEPACK program (22Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab Three platinum and one selenium positions were determined by HASSP (24Terwillinger T.C. Heavyv4 Program. University of California at Los Alamos National Laboratory, 1995Google Scholar) and confirmed with the Shake-and-Bake program package (25Miller R. Gallo S.M. Khalak H.G. Weeks C.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1994; 27: 613-621Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Cross-phasing was carried out between the two derivatives to correlate platinum and selenium heavy atom positions through a common origin. Heavy atom positions were refined using HEAVYv4 (24Terwillinger T.C. Heavyv4 Program. University of California at Los Alamos National Laboratory, 1995Google Scholar) by the origin-removed Patterson technique. The phases were then calculated using PHASES (26Furey W. Swaminathan S. Abstracts of the American Crystallographic Association Meeting. PA33, New Orleans, LA1990: 73Google Scholar) combining both isomorphous and anomalous signals from PIP and the isomorphous signal from the selenomethionine derivative. Solvent flattening was carried out before the MIRAS (multiple isomorphous replacement signals from PIP and selenomethionine derivatives plus the anomalous signal from the PIP derivative) maps were calculated.

Open table in a new tab MIRAS maps for both hands of the heavy atom positions were calculated, and the correct hand was chosen based on the quality of the maps and evidence of right-handed α-helices. Chain-tracing and protein model building were performed manually on a SGI Elan workstation using CHAIN (27Jones T.A J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar). The location of the selenium position played a key role in the tracing of the chain by identifying the only methionine in the β-strand near the C terminus. Identification of the N-terminal α-helix also helped to complete the model building process. The entire polypeptide chain of 79 residues was built into this MIRAS electron density map prior to refinement. A 2Fo− Fc density map of the single methionine-containing β-strand is shown in Fig.1 along with the independent determination of the selenium position from the cross-difference Fourier with the phases from the PIP derivative alone. The model was refined with XPLOR (28Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1, User's Guide. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using the simulated annealing procedure. The resolution was gradually extended to 1.8 Å. Positional and isotropic parameters of a total of 690 non-hydrogen atoms including 77 solvent water oxygens and 1 sulfate ion were refined in the final model, using the 6838 reflections (F ≥ 2ςF) in the range 1.8–8.0 Å. Some of these densities modeled as water oxygens could possibly be other ions present in the crystallization medium. The agreement between the final model and the 2Fo − Fc density map was excellent for the main chain and side chains, except for one break at the Cβ atom of residue Asp37, which is located on the surface of the molecule in a β-turn. The C-terminal Lys79 side chain is also not well defined, probably because of dynamical disorder. The numbers from the final cycle of refinement are provided in Table III. The random positional error estimated from the Luzzati plot (29Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1952; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) is less than 0.20 Å. The average B values remain low throughout most of the residues of the structure. The agreement between side chain densities and the amino acid sequence is unambiguous, except in a few cases. Residues Asp37 and His38 are located at a turn which is exposed to the outer surface; consequently, their average B values are relatively high. The C-terminal Lys79also has a high B average value probably because of dynamical disorder. Although the refinement results shown are based on the unit weight scheme, nonunit weight schemes were also attempted. The atomic coordinates and the electron density maps resulting from these two modes of refinement were virtually identical.Table IIIRefinement results of KP6αResolution range (Å)8.0–1.8No. of reflections used (F > 2ς(F))6838Weighing schemeunit weightPercentage of observed data used96.No. of protein-atoms + SO42−613No. of solvent water77CrystallographicR (F ≥ 2ςF)0.164R free (F ≥ 2ςF)0.211RMS deviation from ideal geometryBond (Å)0.008Angle (°)1.309AverageB values (Å2)Whole protein17.6Backbone15.1Side chains24.6Solvent39.2Ramachandran plot summary:Residues in most favored regions91.4%In additional allowed regions8.6%In disallowed regions0.0% Open table in a new tab A monomer of the KP6 killer toxin α-subunit shown in Fig.2 a forms a single domain structure having an overall shape of an ellipsoid of dimensions 40Å × 26Å × 21Å. The structure has a single split βαβ motif that belongs to the α/β sandwich family (30Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. Structure. 1993; 1: 105-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It consists of a four- (β1, β3, β4, and β5) stranded antiparallel β-sheet, a pair of antiparallel α-helices (α2 and α3) that lies approximately 20° to the β-strands above one side of the sheet, a strand β2 along one edge of the sheet, and a short N-terminal helix α1 on the other side of the β-sheet. The twist of the β-sheet is left-handed, as it usually occurs (13Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar). Among the three linkages of the four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, one belongs to a hairpin connection (β3 to β4), and the other two are right-handed βαβ split crossover connections (β1 to β3 and β4 to β5) via α2 and α3, respectively (13Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar, 30Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. Structure. 1993; 1: 105-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). All the secondary structural elements are connected through six loops. However, only two of them are β turns; one is a β type II turn (13Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar) (Leu39, Ser40, Lys41, and Ser42) connecting the helix α2 with β3, and the other one is a β type I turn (13Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar) (Ser66, Ser67, Leu68, and Asn69) connecting α3 with β5. There are eight cysteines in the structure as indicated in Fig. 2, a and b, all of which form intrachain disulfide bridges linking these secondary structural elements into a compact domain. Helices α2 and α3 are linked to the β-sheet through disulfide bridges: α2 to β4 through Cys35 and Cys51 in a right-handed conformation and α3to β1 through Cys65 and Cys18 in a left-handed conformation. The remaining two disulfide bridges are both right-handed, one formed between the N-terminal helix α1 and the loop connecting it to β1(Cys5 and Cys12) and the other between the two longest antiparallel strands β1 and β5(Cys16 and Cys74). The Cα-Cα distances between a pair of cysteines range from 4.05 to 5.86 Å, depending on the conformation of each individual disulfide bridge. Besides disulfide bonds, the hydrogen bonding network holds the structure together. The hydrogen bonds involving main chain atoms among the five antiparallel β-strands are schematically illustrated in Fig. 2 c. A total of 44 hydrogen bonds are formed among main chain atoms, ranging from 2.67 to 3.14 Å, with an average bond length of 2.93 Å. There are 16 hydrogen bonds between main chain and side chain atoms and 7 hydrogen bonds among side chain atoms ranging from 2.60 to 3.42 Å, with an average value of 2.99 Å. All water molecules are hydrogen-bonded to protein atoms either directly or indirectly through another solvent atom. No exposed cluster of hydrophobic side chains was found in the monomer. Three regions in this molecule interact through hydrophobic side chains that appear to stabilize the tertiary structure. As shown in Fig. 2 b, among the three hydrophobic clusters, two located between the two antiparallel α-helices and the β-sheet are formed by residues Ala20, Leu27, Ala30, and Leu68 at the top of the molecule (opposite of the N terminus) and by Leu39, Phe53, Leu57, Phe61, and Met72 at the lower middle section of the molecule. The third region, located near the N terminus, is comprised of residues Ala3, Phe4, and Phe8 forming a hydrophobic pocket with neighboring symmetry-related molecules. There are four histidines in the molecule; although all four are located on the surface, three of them reside on the helical side of the molecule (His21, His38, and His64), and His50resides on the β-sheet side, as shown in Fig. 2 b. Because the pH of the crystallization buffer was 6.0, one of four of these histidines was deprotonated, which made it possible to coordinate to a heavy metal ion. The surface of the protein is hydrophilic except for the N-terminal helix-α1. The topology of KP6α along with the other two recently determined killer toxins SMK (15Kashiwagi T. Kunishima N. Suzuki C. Tsuchiya F. Nikkuni S. Arata Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 1997; 5: 81-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and KP4 (14Gu F. Khimani A. Rane S.G. Flurkey W.H. Bozarth R.F. Smith T.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) is illustrated schematically in Fig. 2 d. Although all of them have striking similarity in folding motifs, i.e. α/β sandwich motifs, there are distinct differences among them; KP6α has two right-handed βαβ split crossovers, whereas both SMK and KP4 have two left-handed crossovers. A survey (30Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. Structure. 1993; 1: 105-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) has shown that there are more known right-handed α/β sandwich proteins than the left-handed ones. Whether the handedness of connections has any significance in the biological function is not clear at this moment, but it is evident that all resulting structures are unique in their specific functions. Although the KP4 and KP6 killer toxins are both produced by U. maydis, the difference in their folding connections may indicate that they are not functionally similar. As described above, the hydrophobic region with exposed phenyl rings of Phe4 and Phe8 of the monomer is located in the N-terminal α1-helix. Three molecules of the KP6α monomer assemble through this region by a crystallographic 3-fold rotational symmetry forming a trimer. Two trimers further associate by a crystallographic 2-fold rotational symmetry axis perpendicular to the 3-fold axis forming a hexamer with the hydrophobic phenol basket in the middle of the assembly, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The trimeric association is stabilized by intermolecular salt bridges and hydrogen bonds; the bond lengths range from 2.77 to 3.00 Å with an average of 2.88 Å. The salt bridges are formed between Glu15 and Asp45 of one monomer and Arg47 of another. The Ser78side chain and main chain carbonyl at the C terminus of one monomer form hydrogen bonds with side chains of Arg28 and Tyr29 of the neighboring monomer. Intermolecular interactions within a trimer are shown in Fig.3. The hexamer is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the N termini of the two trimers, especially the Gly7-Phe8-Gly9sequence.Figure 5The KP6α hexamer. a, viewed along the crystallographic 3-fold rotation axis. b, viewed along the direction perpendicular to the 3-fold axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3The salt bridge network involving Asp45, Glu15, and Arg47 in a crystallographic trimer of KP6α. The bridging distances are shown in Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The network of intermolecular salt bridges and hydrogen bonds links the monomers to form a solvent-filled funnel-like structure in which the β-sheet of each molecule spreads on the inner surface and the N-terminal α1-helix sits close to the tip of the funnel (Fig. 4, a and b). The funnel is 9–10 Å across at the top, has a 6-Å diameter opening in the middle and narrows to a 4.2-Å diameter barrel bordered by three symmetry related phenyl rings arising from the Gly7-Phe8-Gly9 string of residues at the N-terminal α1-helix. More than 50 well ordered water molecules have been located in the funnel. Fig. 4, aand b shows the KP6α trimer with phenyl rings at the tip of the funnel and water oxygens inside of the funnel. The assembly of the hexamer brings the two narrow funnel tips face to face, thus forming an hourglass shaped structure as shown in Fig.5. The distance between two planes of intratrimer salt bridges is about 34 Å. The analysis of total accessible surfaces for the monomer, the trimer, and the hexamer bears out the above description of molecular association. The details are listed in TableIV. The total accessible surface area for KP6α monomer is 4783 Å2. Because of the formation of the trimer and the hexamer, total accessible surface areas for each monomer decreased by 21.2 and 24.2%, respectively. The loss of accessible surface area/monomer because of oligomerization is 1014 Å2for the trimer and 1157 Å2 for the hexamer. These numbers are in good agreement with the values of ∼800 Å2 for a homodimer and ∼1000 Å2 for a heterocomplex of a 10-kDa protein calculated by Jones and Thorton (31Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar) for 59 different protein-protein complexes. Among lost accessible surfaces, the loss of hydrophobic surface contributed the most, followed by the charged surface and the polar surface. As an overall effect of oligomeric association of KP6α, the percentage of the hydrophilic surface area, consisting of charged and polar residues, increased from 73.0% for the monomer to 75.6 and 78.6% for the trimer and the hexamer, respectively, making them more soluble in an aqueous medium. By forming hexamer from trimer, the gain or loss of both accessible hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are in small magnitudes, ∼3%, indicating a weak tendency to form the hexamer from the trimer.Table IVAccessible surface area (Å 2)TotalChargedPolarHydrophobicMonomer47831455 (30.4%)2038 (42.6%)1289 (27.0%)Trimer11,3063060 (27.1%)5484 (48.5%)2763 (24.4%)↕ vs. monomer(↓ 21.2%)(↓ 3.3%)(↑ 5.9%)(↓ 2.6%)Hexmer21,7486137 (28.2%)10,957 (50.4%)4655 (21.4%)↕ vs. monomer(↓ 24.2%)(↓ 2.2%)(↑ 7.8%)(↓ 5.6%)↕ vs. trimer(↓ 3.8%)(↑ 1.1%)(↑ 1.9%)(↓ 3.0%) Open table in a new tab It is conceivable that the crystallographic monomer, the trimer, or the hexamer of KP6α, in association with one or more polypeptides of KP6β forms a molecular assembly that interacts with either the K+channel or another receptor on the cell membrane or even by itself penetrates the membrane and causes disruption of the cellular ion balance. No conclusive biochemical evidence is available yet on any of these possibilities. The KP6α hexamer has an inner pore opening of 4.2 Å, large enough for monovalent cations such as K+ to pass through and a length of 34 Å, similar to the thickness of the membrane bilayer. Although neither KP4 nor SMK structures exhibit similar oligomeric association, the distantly related all β-strand γ-cardiotoxin (32Bilwes A. Rees B. Moras D. Menez R. Menez A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) is trimeric. However, the central opening of the trimer narrows to less than 0.5 Å where interfacial atoms are virtually at van der Waals contact distances (32Bilwes A. Rees B. Moras D. Menez R. Menez A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It was proposed that γ-cardiotoxin in its oligomeric state could either interact with a membrane receptor or could insert itself into the membrane forming an ion channel (32Bilwes A. Rees B. Moras D. Menez R. Menez A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no other member of this class of toxins is known to have a central pore like the one in the KP6α hexamer. Cardiotoxins are known to act by depolarizing the Ca+channel. KP4 was shown to kill cells by blocking divalent cation channels but not Na+ or K+ channels (14Gu F. Khimani A. Rane S.G. Flurkey W.H. Bozarth R.F. Smith T.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). KP4 crystallizes as a monomer and a single polypeptide chain is known to possess the killer action (14Gu F. Khimani A. Rane S.G. Flurkey W.H. Bozarth R.F. Smith T.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Structural data suggest that its participation in channel formation is unlikely. The mechanism of pH-dependent killer action of SMK is still unknown (15Kashiwagi T. Kunishima N. Suzuki C. Tsuchiya F. Nikkuni S. Arata Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 1997; 5: 81-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The monomer containing the α- and the β-peptides forms a dimer in the crystal (15Kashiwagi T. Kunishima N. Suzuki C. Tsuchiya F. Nikkuni S. Arata Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 1997; 5: 81-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Despite the overall similarity of folds of monomers of these toxins, there appears to be diversity in the mechanism of killing action, possibly stemming from diverse oligomeric states of their functional entities. KP6 is distinctive in the sense that it kills by depleting the K+, unlike any other toxin in the family. The architecture of the KP6α hexamer provides a pore structure that has right dimensions to function as a K+channel, either outside or within the cell membrane bilayer. However, the outer surface of the hexamer as well as the monomer has polar and charged residues, accounting for the solubility of the toxin in aqueous medium. In order for the KP6 assembly to enter the membrane bilayer, the outer polar surface must be concealed. It is conceivable that the β-subunit plays a critical structural role in this aspect because it is known that both subunits are necessary for the killer action of the toxin. Any large rearrangement in the tertiary structure of KP6α on complexation with the β-subunit is unlikely, because of its compact nature that is rigidly held by four disulfide bridges. Formation of higher order oligomeric states either by the KP6α hexamer or by an α-β complex to hide hydrophilic surfaces from the lipid environment is also a plausible scenario. Further insight into the mechanism of action of KP6 may come from the crystal structure of an active complex of α- and β-subunits of the toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1991921228,"We have used mutagenesis to investigate the potential N-glycosylation sites in the δ subunit of the mouse muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Of the three sites, Asn76, Asn143, and Asn169, only the first two were glycosylated when the δ subunit was expressed in COS cells. Because the heterologously expressed δ subunit was similar in its properties to that expressed in C2 muscle cells, the sites of glycosylation are likely to be the same in both cases. In COS cells, mutations of the δ subunit that prevented glycosylation at either of the sites did not change its metabolic stability nor its steady-state level. These results are in contrast to those found previously for the α subunit, in which glycosylation at a single site metabolically stabilized the polypeptide (Blount, P., and Merlie, J. P. (1990)J. Cell Biol. 111, 2613–2622). Mutations of the δ subunit that prevented glycosylation, however, decreased its ability to form an αδ heterodimer when the α and δ subunit were expressed together. When all four subunits of the AChR (α, β, δ, and ε) were coexpressed, mutation of the δ subunit to prevent glycosylation resulted in a reduced amount of fully assembled AChR and reduced surface AChR levels, consistent with the role of the heterodimer in the assembly reaction. These results suggest that glycosylation of the δ subunit at both Asn76 and Asn143 is needed for its efficient folding and/or its subsequent interaction with the α subunit.

These receptors are clustered in the postsynaptic membrane, where they mediate rapid excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. For each member of this family, the individual subunits are arranged in a pseudosymmetric array around an aqueous channel.

Nature. 1982; 299: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Each of the subunits is synthesized from a separate mRNA, and each undergoes translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes post-translational processing, including signal sequence cleavage and glycosylation (10Anderson D.J. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5598-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Following synthesis, the α subunit undergoes a folding reaction that appears to involve disulfide bond formation and that confers upon the α subunit the ability to bind α-bungarotoxin (α-BuTx; Refs.11Merlie J.P.

The other subunits presumably undergo folding reactions as well, although it has not been possible to measure these directly. The N-terminal domains of all four subunits possess a disulfide loop with a conserved glycosylation site contained within it; the ε subunit contains one, and the δ subunit contains two, other potential glycosylation sites as well. The folded subunits assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (10Anderson D.J. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5598-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Smith M.M.

The fully assembled AChR is then transported to the Golgi, where some of its high mannose oligosaccharide chains are converted to complex oligosaccharides (20Gu Y. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12878-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Nomoto H. Takahashi N. Nagaki Y. Endo S. Arata Y. Hayashi K. Eur. J.

Chem. 1984; 259: 5364-5367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although each of the subunits of the AChR contains consensus glycosylation sites and each is glycosylated, little is known about the functional role of the oligosaccharide chains. Studies with other proteins indicate that sugar addition can affect various properties of a protein, including its three-dimensional conformation, solubility, stability, and ability to associate with other proteins (23Dwek R.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Dwek R.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1234-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The α subunit of the AChR has a single glycosylation site which undergoes sugar addition to form a simple (high mannose) oligosaccharide (21Nomoto H. Takahashi N. Nagaki Y. Endo S. Arata Y. Hayashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and studies using glycosylation inhibitors and site-directed mutagenesis have shown that the abolition of oligosaccharide addition results in rapid degradation of the receptor subunit (25Merlie J.P. Sebbane R. Tzartos S. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2694-2701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The β subunit has a single glycosylation site, and the δ subunit has three potential sites of glycosylation, all of which are in the N-terminal extracellular domain; the ε subunit, and its developmental homolog, γ, have two potential sites in this domain. Recent mutational studies of the highly conserved glycosylation site associated with the disulfide loop in all four subunits have shown that abolition of this site in the α, γ, and δ subunits, but not in the β subunit, eliminates surface expression of the assembled AChR (27Gehle V.M. Walcott E.C. Nishizaki T. Sumikawa K. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We now report experiments investigating the function of each of the three putative glycosylation sites in the mouse muscle δ subunit using in vitro mutagenesis and expression in heterologous cells. We find that the mobility of the δ subunit made in COS cells and in muscle cells is similar, suggesting that the number of oligosaccharide chains is the same in the two cases. In COS cells, we find that only two of the three potential sites of the δ subunit are glycosylated and that mutation of either of the two reduces the association of the δ subunit with α to form a heterodimer, thus affecting the intracellular assembly of the AChR and its subsequent appearance on the cell surface. Mutation of the glycosylation sites did not affect the metabolic stability of the δ subunit. Thus, glycosylation at both sites is required for efficient folding of the subunit and/or for association with the α subunit to form a heterodimer. We conclude that in contrast to the α subunit, in which glycosylation serves to stabilize the protein (26Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), glycosylation of the δ subunit promotes efficient folding and assembly. The cDNAs encoding the full-length murine α and β subunits (28Buonanno A. Mudd J. Shah V. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16451-16458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Isenberg K.E. Mudd J. Shah V. Merlie J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were kindly given to us by the late Dr. John Merlie (Washington University, St. Louis). The δ subunit (30Lapolla R.J. Mayne K.M. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was the gift of Dr. Norman Davidson (CalTech, Pasadena). The ε subunit (31Gu Y. Franco A. Gardner P.D. Lansman J.B. Forsayeth J.R. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1990; 5: 147-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was given to us by Dr. Paul Gardner (University of Texas, San Antonio). Each of the cDNAs was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the SV-40-based pSM vector (32Brodsky M.H. Warton M. Myers R.M. Littman D.R. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3078-3086PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to disrupt the three consensus glycosylation sites (NX(S/T)) of the δ subunit corresponding to the asparagine residues at positions 76, 143, and 169 (Fig. 1 B). The serine or the threonine residues were converted to alanine using the thermal cycling-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, two complementary oligonucleotides (125 ng each) containing the desired mutation were added to a solution of 50 ng of template δ subunit DNA, 10 mm dNTP, and Pfu DNA polymerase buffer (50-μl final volume). Pfu DNA polymerase (1 μl) was added to start the extension process in a thermal cycler. Extensions involved one cycle at 95 °C for 30 s to denature the DNA, followed by 15 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, followed by 1 min at 55 °C and then 10 min at 68 °C. The extension product was incubated with DpnI to digest the methylated parental plasmid and used to transform DH5-α cells, which were then plated on agar plates. Individual colonies were picked, and the cDNAs were sequenced using dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Sequenase kit, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The mutagenic oligonucleotides used to generate the T78A mutant were as follows: sense, C TTC GGG AAC ATC GCT GTC CTG CGC CTG C, and antisense, G CAG GCG CAG GAC AGC GAT GTT CCC GAA G; for the S145A mutant, sense, C TGG CAG AAC TGCGCC CTC AAA TTC AGT TC, and antisense, GA ACT GAA TTT GAG GGC GCA GTT CTG CCA G; and for the S171A mutant, sense, G GAA AAC AAC CGC GCT TAC CCC ATT GAG TG, and antisense, CA CTC AAT GGG GTA AGC GCG GTT GTT TTC C (the base changes causing the mutations are underlined). In this manner, first, the single mutants δT78A, δS145A and δS171A (henceforth called G1, G2, and G3, respectively) were generated, which were then used as templates to make the double mutants δT78A, S145A, δS145A, S171A, and δT78A, S171A (G1G2, G2G3, and G1G3) and finally the triple mutant δT78A, S145A, S171A (G1G2G3). COS cells were maintained in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Transfections were performed by an adenovirus-mediated DEAE-dextran procedure as described previously (33Forsayeth J.R. Garcia P.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 354-358PubMed Google Scholar,34Wang Z.-Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27575-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (grown in 60-mm dishes) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then treated with a solution of 2.5 ml of serum-free DMEM and 0.5 ml of a replication deficient adenoviral extract containing 240 μg of DEAE-dextran and the appropriate plasmid(s). Where all four subunits were cotransfected, 1.32 μg of α, 0.66 μg of β, 0.32 μg of δ (or its mutants), and 1 μg of ε plasmids were added. After 2 h of exposure to the transfection solution, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and following replacement with growth medium, they were replaced in the incubator. Where only one plasmid was expressed, 2 μg of plasmid was used in the transfection mixture; where two plasmids were to be coexpressed, 2 μg of each was used. When cells were grown in larger dishes, the transfection mixture was identical except that the quantities were adjusted for surface area. C2C12 (C2) cells were maintained as described previously (35Fuhrer C. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32474-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, myoblasts were seeded at low density in DMEM supplemented with 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, 20% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% chick embryo extract, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. At about 90% confluence, the cells were induced to form myotubes by changing the medium to differentiating medium, which comprised DMEM, 5% horse serum, and 2 mmglutamine. Fusion of the myoblasts into myotubes occurred within 1 day. Contracting myotubes were observed a day later, at which time the C2 cultures were used for experiments. Twenty-four hours after cotransfection with all four subunits, the cells were replated into 12-well cluster dishes, and an additional 24 h later, surface binding studies were conducted. Briefly, the cells were washed once with PBS and then incubated for 90 min in a reaction mixture consisting of DMEM containing 125I-α-BuTx (4 nm). The reaction mixture was then aspirated, and the cells were washed three times with PBS. The cells in each well were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.2n NaOH and counted in a γ-counter. COS cells (60-mm dishes) transfected with δ plasmids were washed once with 2 ml of cysteine- and methionine-free DMEM medium (serum-free) and then incubated for 30 min in 2 ml of identical medium, which was replaced with 2 ml of a labeling mixture consisting of ∼200 μCi of Pro-mix™ (a mixture of l-[35S]methionine andl-[35S]cysteine) in cysteine- and methionine-free medium (30 min). The labeling mix was aspirated and the cells were quickly washed once with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 2 mg/ml each of cysteine and methionine (start of the countdown for the chase), prior to the addition of regular DMEM growth medium and replacement in the incubator. All of the above operations were at 37 °C. To terminate the reaction at each time point, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested in 140 μl of cold extraction buffer comprising Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4), NaCl (50 mm), EDTA (1 mm), EGTA (1 mm), Triton X-100 (1%), sodium tetrathionate (1 mm),N-ethylmaleimide (1 mm), benzamidine (1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.4 mm), leupeptin (20 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), and aprotinin (10 units). The lysate was then spun at high speed (14,000 rpm) in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet debris was discarded. The δ subunit-specific antibody mAb 88B (36Froehner S.C. Douville K. Klink S. Culp W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7112-7120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to 40 μl of the clear extract to a final concentration of 80 nm. The volume was then adjusted to 0.5 ml with cold extraction buffer, and the solution was tumbled for 90 min at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (40 μl of slurry) was then added to each of the samples, which were then tumbled at 4 °C for an additional 90 min. Following this, the samples were centrifuged at low speed, and the pellets were washed three times with ice-cold extraction buffer. The immunoprecipitate was solubilized by adding 65 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample-loading buffer to the beads and boiling for 6 min. The supernatants were run on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, enhanced in 1 m salicylic acid, and subjected to autoradiography. The band intensities were quantitated using NIH Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). COS cells grown in 60-mm dishes were cotransfected with the α and δ plasmids. Forty-eight hours later, they were harvested in cold extraction buffer (140 μl) and a 40-μl aliquot of the clear lysate was diluted with extraction buffer to a final volume of 0.5 ml, to which 125I-α-BuTx (4 nm) was added. To this, mAb 88B antibody was added (80 nm), and the mixture was rotated for 90 min at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (40 μl of slurry) was then added to each of the samples, which were then tumbled at 4 °C for an additional 90 min. Following this, the samples were centrifuged at low speed, the pellets were washed three times with cold extraction buffer, and the radioactivity associated with the pellet was measured in a γ-counter. COS cells (60-mm dishes) transfected with 2 μg of δ plasmids were metabolically 35S-labeled with Pro-mixTM, and extracts were immunoprecipitated with 88B as described above. Prior to SDS-PAGE, the samples were digested with one of the glycosidases, endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or peptideN-glycosidase F (PNGase), as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). In each case, 2500 units of enzyme was added to the denatured sample in a total volume of 80 μl (the final SDS concentration was 0.5%). Endo H is active under these conditions; for PNGase digestion, Nonidet P-40 (1%) was additionally added to the supplied glycosidase buffer (New England Biolabs) to counter the effect of SDS. The digestion was allowed to progress for 18 h at 37 °C. The results indicated that the enzymes were active in the experiments. Doubling the amount of enzyme caused no further detectable effect, indicating that digestion was complete. Either COS cells (150-mm dishes) transfected with all four subunits or untransfected C2 cells were harvested in 1 ml of extraction buffer. AChR was isolated by incubating the extract with α-BuTx-conjugated Sepharose beads (35Fuhrer C. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32474-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Fuhrer C. Sugiyama J.E. Taylor R.G. Hall Z.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4951-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), following which the beads were pelleted and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer for 6 min. Glycosidase digestions of the samples were carried out as described above. The samples were applied to a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and the blot was probed for the δ subunit with the 88B antibody as described previously (35Fuhrer C.

We made mutations in each of the three potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn76, Asn143, and Asn169) in the mouse muscle δ subunit and tested the mutated constructs (called G1, G2, and G3, respectively; see Fig.1 B and “Experimental Procedures”) by expression in heterologous cells. We examined the δ subunit produced in transfected COS cells in two ways: first, by immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody 88B, which is specific for the δ and γ subunits (Fig. 2), and second, by immunoprecipitating extracts of metabolically labeled cells with the same antibody (Fig.3 A). After immunoprecipitation, both wild-type and mutant δ subunits consistently appeared as two major bands separated by 7–10 kDa (Fig.3 A); after immunoblotting, the subunit appeared as a broad and diffuse band whose resolution into two or more individual bands was only variably seen (Fig. 2). The apparent molecular mass and breadth of the band were consistent with those previously seen for the δ subunit expressed either normally in C2 muscle cells (15Gu Y. Ralston E. Murphy-Erdosh C. Black R.A. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or following transfection in COS cells (31Gu Y. Franco A. Gardner P.D. Lansman J.B. Forsayeth J.R. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1990; 5: 147-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because the glycosylation-incompetent G1G2G3 mutant also ran as a doublet (Figs. 2 and 3 A), the multiple bands do not result from differential glycosylation as previously suggested (21Nomoto H. Takahashi N. Nagaki Y. Endo S. Arata Y. Hayashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38Blount P. Smith M.M. Merlie J.P. J.

A, COS cells transfected with the indicated cDNAs were labeled with a mixture of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine and immunoprecipitated with the 88B antibody. Following solubilization of the pellet, equal volumes were subjected to reducing 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography; shown is a fluorogram exposed overnight.B–E, glycosidase digestion analysis of the G1G2, G2G3, G1G3, and wild-type δ subunits, respectively.

The samples were digested with the indicated glycosidases prior to application to a 12.5% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Despite the uncertainty about the identity and significance of the sub-bands, the results of the mutation experiments were very clear, and were the same, whether the proteins were detected by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. When the mobilities of G1 and G2 mutant proteins were compared with that of the wild-type protein, the mutants showed increased mobilities in both cases (Figs. 2 and 3 A). In contrast, the mobility of the G3 mutant protein was less than that of either G1 or G2 and appeared to be identical to that of the wild-type protein. These results suggested that in the wild-type δ subunit, sites Asn78 and Asn143 are glycosylated in COS cells but that site Asn169 is not. These conclusions were further borne out by the mobility of the double and triple mutants. First, the mutants G1G3 and G2G3 had the same mobilities as the G1 and G2 mutants, respectively; and second, the mobility of G1G2 was identical to that of the triple mutant G1G2G3, both being faster than any of the single mutants. Finally, the lack of glycosylation at Asn169 was confirmed by an experiment in which the G1G2 mutant protein was treated with either of the glycosidases, Endo H or PNGase. These treatments had no effect on the mobility of the G1G2 subunit (Fig. 3 B); under similar conditions, the mobilities of the wild-type and the G1G3 and G2G3 subunits were shifted (Fig. 3, C–E). The upper band of the G1 protein was shifted to a smaller extent than that of the G2 protein, suggesting that Asn143 is more extensively glycosylated than Asn76 (Fig. 3 A). Taken together, the results of all of these experiments provide strong evidence for glycosylation of the δ subunit in COS cells at sites Asn76 and Asn143 but not at site Asn169. We then wished to determine if the δ subunit made in COS cells had similar glycosylation properties to that made in muscle cells. Our laboratory has previously shown that the δ subunit of the native rat skeletal muscle AChR is glycosylated, and it contains both simple (high mannose) and complex sugars (20Gu Y. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12878-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because complex sugars are formed in the Golgi and the subunits are only transported to the Golgi as part of a fully assembled AChR (38Blount P. Smith M.M. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2601-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we expressed the δ subunit along with the α, β, and ε subunits in COS cells for the comparison. Extracts of both COS and C2 cells were then incubated with α-BuTx-Sepharose to partially purify the receptor, and eluates of the Sepharose were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As previously reported (20Gu Y. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12878-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the δ subunit from C2 cells showed two major bands (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). The mobilities of these bands were approximately the same as those of the major bands from COS cells, although the C2 bands appeared to be slightly faster (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 3). These results suggest that in muscle cells, as in COS cells, the δ subunit is glycosylated at only two sites but that the pattern of glycosylation in COS cells is slightly different from that seen in C2 cells. To further examine the pattern of glycosylation in the two cell types, the δ subunits were subjected to glycosidase treatment, either with Endo H, selective for high mannose oligosaccharides, or with the nonspecific PNGase. The banding patterns of the δ subunit from COS cells and from C2 cells were essentially the same after PNGase treatment (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and3). The mobilities of the major δ bands from COS cells were similar following either Endo H or PNGase treatment (Fig. 4,B, lane 1, and C, lane 1), indicating that a majority of the δ subunit expressed in COS cells undergoes simple sugar addition. A small fraction of COS-expressed δ subunit was, however, resistant to Endo H (Fig.4 B, lane 1, uppermost band), indicating the presence of complex oligosaccharide chains. Identical treatment of the native δ subunit from C2 cells showed that a larger f"

Furthermore, an asymmetrically disabled but functional scIL-5 mutant, (wt/A5)scIL-5, was displayed on phage. (wt/A5)scIL-5 was constructed from an N-terminal half containing the original five charged residues (88EERRR92) in the CD loop, including the Glu89 and Arg91 believed key in the α chain recognition site, combined with a C-terminal half containing a disabled CD loop sequence (88AAAAA92) missing the key recognition residues.

IL-5 is a homodimer that folds into a cylindrical molecule containing two four-helix bundles (2Milburn M.V. Hassell A.M. Lambert M.H. Jordan S.R. Proudfoot A.E.I. Graber P. Wells T.N.C.

The α chain is cytokine-specific and by itself can bind IL-5 with high affinity (3Murata Y. Takaki S. Migita M. Kikuchi Y. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. J . Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that residues clustered near the helix bundle interface, in the CD loop, including Glu89 and Arg91, and at the carboxyl-terminal end of helix D, notably Glu110, engage in receptor α chain binding (4Tavernier J.

Glu13, which is at each of the distal ends of the IL-5 cylinder away from the interface between the two four-helix bundles and is not involved directly in α chain interaction, is a key residue mediating productive interaction of the βc chain of IL-5 receptor (4Tavernier J. Tuypens A.V. Plaetinck R.D. Heyden J.V. Cuisez Y. Oefner C. Proc . Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5194-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5Graber P. Proudfoot A.E. Talabot F.

It is the βc recruitment into αβc that leads to triggering of the intracellular signaling cascade. Although site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified important residues for receptor binding, the one-residue-at-a-time substitution allowed by this technique limits a full mechanistic understanding of the specific structural and electrostatic features of the IL-5 surface required for receptor-ligand interaction. However, through the use of randomly generated side chain libraries, it should be possible to measure the effect of replacing individual side chains or sets of side chains in local regions on the IL-5 surface and hence determine which combinations allow productive binding. Such random epitope mutagenesis can be achieved with sequence libraries formed by phage display. This technique has been applied successfully to in vitro antibody maturation and protein engineering (7Clackson T. Wells J.A. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 173-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Typically a foreign gene is fused in frame with phage coat protein pIII encoded by a phagemid vector, and the surface-displayed recombinant foreign protein selected by affinity selection procedures (biopanning). Human growth hormone has been displayed on phage and higher receptor affinity variants selected through random mutagenesis and phage panning (8Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J . Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10982-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phage display of multichain proteins also has been achieved, for example for antibody Fab fragments (9Baca M. Presta L.G. O'Connor S.J. Wells J.A. J . Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10678-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and vascular epidermal growth factor (10Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. de Vos A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, in our hands, phage display of the dimeric wild type IL-5 has proven difficult, perhaps reflecting folding difficulties that previously have led to insoluble inclusion bodies in intracellularEscherichia coli expression (11Proudfoot A.E.I. Fattah D. Kawashima E.H. Bernard A. Wingfield P.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have sought to overcome limitations in phage display of IL-5 by using a single chain form of human IL-5 (scIL-5), in which two IL-5 molecules are tandemly linked by a Gly-Gly dipeptide linker (12Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Single chain IL-5 and wtIL-5 have virtually identical biological activities and binding affinities for shIL-5Rα. Since scIL-5 requires the export and folding of only one polypeptide chain, this form provides a new opportunity for E. coli expression and phage display. In this paper, we report the successful display of scIL-5 on filamentous phage and functional evaluation of scIL-5 fused to phage. In addition, an asymmetric mutant of scIL-5, denoted (wt/A5)scIL-5, has been used as a starting point to prepare a scIL-5 library in which the N-terminal CD loop has been randomized in order to identify functional IL-5 variants of this region of the receptor α chain pharmacophore. Following affinity selection and initial characterization of E. coli-expressed and purified recombinant protein, we have identified a (SLRGG/A5)scIL-5 variant that retains significant affinity for IL-5 receptor α chain as well as bioactivity. The findings reflect the mutability of a key component of the IL-5 receptor pharmacophore and confirm the utility of phage display for examination of the IL-5 receptor recruitment mechanism. pCDN-IL-5 (6Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc . Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which encodes human IL-5, was used as a template for the PCR to generate an IL-5 gene fragment. The primers used in this PCR reaction were as follows: primer A (forward primer), 5′-GCCCATGCCATGGCCGGAGCCAGATCTGAAATT-3′ (NcoI and BglII sites underlined); primer B (reverse primer), 5′-CTAGTCTAGAGGATCCTTATCAACTTT-3′ (XbaI site underlined). The resulting 350-bp PCR product was digested with NcoI andXbaI and was used to replace theNcoI/SpeI fragment of pMK-IL-4-G3 to yield pMK-IL-5. Plasmid pMK-IL-4-G3 was derived by modification of pMK-G3H (13Tsui P. Tornetta M.A. Ames R.S. Bankosky B.C. Greigo S. Silverman C. Porter T. Moore G. Sweet R.W. J . Immunol. 1996; 157: 772-780PubMed Google Scholar), in which the MunI/XbaI fragment of pMK-G3H was deleted and an IL-4 coding sequence was ligated between theNcoI/SpeI sites. Phage preparations from pMK-IL-4-G3 plasmid-transformed cells specifically bind to the soluble IL-4Rα and anti-IL-4 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 2P. Tsui, unpublished results. The single chain IL-5 DNA was derived by BglII digestion of pCDN-IL-5(sc) (12Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The 350-bp scIL-5 BglII fragment was ligated into the BglII site of pMK-IL-5, yielding pMK-scIL-5. pMK-scIL-5 encodes a scIL-5 protein containing two tandem IL-5 sequences linked by a Gly-Gly sequence. This scIL-5 sequence is the same as the COS-expressed scIL-5 (12Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) except that there are two extra amino acids (Met-Ala) at the N terminus of E. coli-expressed scIL-5. To construct asymmetric mutants in scIL-5, two tandem IL-5 sequences in pMK-scIL-5 were separated and inserted into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), yielding two working vectors, pCR-IL-5A and pCR-IL-5B. The existingBglII site, which is 12 nucleotides downstream of the 5′-end coding region in the IL-5 gene, was eliminated using oligonucleotide<primer C (5′-AACCAGCCATGGCCGGAGCCAGGTCTGAAATT-3′). The underlined nucleotide indicates a mismatch in the template. The vectors pCR-IL-5A and pCR-IL-5B contain the N-terminal half and C-terminal half of scIL-5, respectively. The vector pCR-IL-5A has NcoI andBglII sites on the 5′-end and 3′-end, respectively, of the IL-5 gene. The pCR-IL-5B vector has BglII andBamHI sites on the 5′-end and 3′-end, respectively, of the IL-5 gene. To generate an asymmetric CD loop mutation in scIL-5, the sequence 88EERRR92 in pCR-IL-5B was mutated to five Ala residues using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The combination of wild-type CD loop in the N-terminal half and an Ala block (A5) CD loop in the C-terminal half of scIL-5 yielded an asymmetric mutant phagemid, designated as pMK-wt/A5. In pMK-scIL-5 (above), there is a stop codon between scIL-5 and gene III. In order to construct a vector encoding the scIL-5-pIII fusion protein, the scIL-5 gene fragment was amplified from pMK-scIL-5 by PCR using primer A (above) and a new primer D, 5′-CTAGTCTAGAGGATCCACTTTCTATTATCCACTC-3′ (XbaI site underlined). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with NcoI andXbaI and ligated into the NcoI andSpeI site of pMK-IL-4-G3, yielding pMK-scIL-5-G3 (Fig.1 A). The sequence constructed by fusing scIL-5 to pIII is as follows: Met-Ala-scIL-5-Gly-Ser-pIII(Thr198–Ser413). E. coli XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) harboring pMK-scIL-5-G3 were grown in 100 ml of super broth medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 1% glucose at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 1.0. The culture was then infected with 50 μl of M13 VCS helper phage (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After 1 h, kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 75 μg/ml, and the culture was shaken at 250 rpm at 37 °C overnight. Phage were precipitated from cell-free medium by adding one-fourth volume of 3.3 m sodium chloride, 20% polyethylene glycol 8000 (FisherBiotech, Fair Lawn, NJ), mixed thoroughly, kept on ice for at least 30 min, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Phage pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Phage titers, defined as carbenicillin-resistant colony-forming units per ml (cfu/ml), were determined according to Zhong and Smith (14Zhong G. Smith G.P. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 838-839PubMed Google Scholar). PRO-BIND ELISA plates (Falcon) were coated with 100 μl (10 μg/ml) of either the rat anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody 4A6, which does not neutralize the IL-5-receptor α chain interaction, or shIL-5Rα-Fc (15Li J. Cook R. Hensley P. Doyle M. McNulty D. Chaiken I. Proc . Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6694-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Protein-charged ELISA plates were incubated with 100 μl of phage samples in PBS buffer for 1 h at 37 °C, and the wells then were washed with PBS plus 0.5% Tween 20 (PBST). Phage binding was detected with a 1:2500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-M13 IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and color development with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidine dihydrochloride. This reagent was dissolved in 0.05 mphosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.03% sodium perborate (Sigma). The reaction was detected by reading the absorbance at 450 nm. Null phage, which did not carry any insert, were used as background control. Competitive phage ELISA on microtiter plates coated with shIL-5Rα-Fc (20 μg/ml) were performed to confirm the relative receptor binding affinities of different phage selectants. The experiments were carried out according to Jones et al. (16Jones J.T. Ballinger M.D. Pisacane P.I. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Fairbrother W.J. Wells J.A. Sliwkowski M.X. J . Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11667-11674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A concentration of phage sample, predetermined to elicit 60% signal in titration assays, was incubated with different concentrations of soluble IL-5Rα, ranging from 0 to 500 nm. These phage mixtures were then added to the shIL-5Rα-Fc-coated microwells. Following incubation, microtiter plates were washed thoroughly, and bound phage were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phage antibody (1:900 dilution). EC50 values were determined by fit to a four-parameter equation to determine the concentration of competing shIL-5Rα that resulted in half-maximal phage binding. A BIAcore biosensor was used to detect receptor binding of scIL-5 phage. IL-5 receptor α chain, shIL-5Rα-Fc, was immobilized directly onto the biosensor CM5 chip using EDC/NHS chemistry (6Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc . Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Single chain IL-5 phage at 2 × 1013 cfu/ml were injected onto the receptor-coated surface at 2 μl/min for 4 min. Phage samples were incubated with different concentrations of sIL-5Rα, ranging from 0 to 25 μm, and were then passed over the IL-5Rα-Fc surface. After this association phase, the surface was washed with running buffer, PBS plus 0.01% Tween 20, at a rate of 100 μl/min for 1 min. The net amount bound was determined as the difference in signal between points before sample injection and after the 100-μl buffer wash. Regeneration of the sensor surface was achieved with 10 mmHCl (pH 2.0). IL-5Rα-Fc was affinity-captured on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a density of 2 μg of IL-5Rα-Fc/μl of drained resin. scIL-5 phage and IL-4 phage were mixed at a ratio of 1:100 (based on titer) to a total titer of 1.0 × 1012 cfu/ml. One hundred μl of the mixed phage were incubated with 20 μl of IL-5Rα-Fc resin with constant rotation for 1.5 h at room temperature to facilitate the binding interaction. The mixture was transferred onto a MultiScreen filtration system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and rapidly washed four times with 400 μl of PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20. The resin was eluted with 100 μl of 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.0) and neutralized with 25 μl of 1 m Tris-base (pH 8.0). The eluted phage samples were amplified by infection of E. coliXL1-Blue cells, followed by superinfection with M13 VCS helper phage. An aliquot of phage sample was used to infect XL1-Blue cells, and the transfected cells were plated on LB agar containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Colonies were randomly picked for DNA miniprep of phagemid vectors. The identity of the phage was determined by restriction-digestion analysis. To design an N-terminal half CD loop library in which residues Glu88, Glu89, Arg90, Arg91, and Arg92 were randomly mutated, the pCR-IL-5A vector was used as the parental DNA. The existing unique ClaI andDraIII restriction sites, which were 27 nucleotides upstream and 54 nucleotides downstream, respectively, of the CD loop DNA coding region in the IL-5 gene, were used to generate a randomly mutated cassette. This cassette was constructed from the following mutagenic oligonucleotides: primer CD101, 5′-ATACATCGATGGCCAAAAAAAAAAGTGTGGA(NNB)5GTAAACCAATTCCTAGACTA-3′ (ClaI site underlined); primer CD102, 5′-TTCTATTATCCACTCGGTGTTCATTACACCAAGAAACTCCTGCAGATAGTCTAGGAATTGGTTTAC-3′ (DraIII site underlined). The codons were designed to be NNB, where N is all four nucleotides and B is C, G, or T. This bias utilizes 48 of the total 64 codons to encode all 20 amino acid residues. The assembly reactions were carried out according to Kayet al. (17Kay B.K. Adey N.B. He Y.-S. Manfredi J.P. Mataragnon A.H. Fowlkes D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The reaction products were digested withClaI plus DraIII and purified by 1.5% agarose gel elution. The recovered fragments were then ligated toClaI plus DraIII-digested pCR-IL-5A vector DNA. The ligation products were electrotransformed into XL1-Blue cells for plasmid preparation in three aliquots, yielding 2 × 107, 6 × 107, and 9 × 107 independent transformants. About 6 × 107 independent transformants were obtained for this CD loop library, thus yielding good representation of the possible amino acid sequence combinations. This sampling size is similar to those reported previously (18Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J. Mol . Biol. 1993; 234: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 19Toniatti C. Cabibbo A. Sporeno E.

The plasmid preparation, carrying the randomly mutated cassette, was digested with NcoI plusBglII, and the resulting cassette was purified by gel elution. Finally, this mutated cassette was ligated to NcoI plus BglII-digested pMK-wt/A5 phagemid DNA, which was electrotransformed into XL1-Blue cells for phagemid preparation. The library had a working titer of 1 × 1012cfu/ml. IL-5Rα-Fc was immobilized directly onto CNBr-activated Sepharose 6MB (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at 4 °C, at a density of 2 μg of IL-5Rα-Fc/μl of drained resin. The coupling procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sixty μl of CD loop library phage samples were incubated with 40 μl of IL-5Rα-Fc resin. One hundred μl of PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 were added to the reaction mixture. Incubation was carried out with constant rotation for 1.5 h at room temperature to facilitate the binding interaction. The resin was washed, and the bound phage was eluted with 100 μl of 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.0) and neutralized with 25 μl of 1 m Tris-base (pH 8.0). An aliquot of eluted phage solution was used to titer the number of phage selected. The remaining phage eluted from IL-5Rα-Fc resin were propagated for use in the next affinity selection cycle. After four rounds of selection, 20 individual clones were selected and sequenced. pMK-scIL-5, and mutants were electroporated into TOPP3 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The recombinant cells were grown, in super broth medium (32 g of Trypton, 20 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl in 1 liter of medium) containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 1% glucose at 37 °C, until A 600 reached 0.6. The cells were then induced with 1 mm IPTG and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells from 1 liter of the induced culture were pelleted by centrifugation (7000 × g, for 15 min), frozen, and thawed twice in 20 ml of 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). The lysate in HEPES buffer was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was frozen and saved for further purification. To purify E. coli-expressed scIL-5 or mutant, the lysate supernatant from 1 liter of the induced culture was dialyzed against PBS buffer (pH 7.4). The supernatant was loaded onto an affinity column packed with mAb 2E3-Sepharose 4B matrix. The 2E3 mAb is a neutralizing antibody that blocks hIL-5 interaction with the α chain of the IL-5 receptor (20Ames R.S. Tornetta M.A. McMillan L.J. Kaiser K.F. Holmes S.D. Appelbaum E. Cusimano D.M.

The column was washed with PBS buffer, and bound scIL-5 or mutant was eluted with 0.1 m glycine buffer (pH 2.5). Pooled fractions from the affinity column were neutralized with 2 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and dialyzed against PBS buffer (pH 7.4). The final yield of scIL-5 and mutants was analyzed by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Biological activity was measured using a subclone of a highly responsive subclone of the human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 (12Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (22Monfardini C. Ramamoorthy M.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented withl-Glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin and 10% heat-treated fetal calf serum (Life Techniques, Inc.). Plates with 96 round-bottomed wells were seeded with 5000 cells/well and incubated for 48 h in triplicate in the presence of serially diluted scIL-5 and mutant proteins. Then, 20 μl of 5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Thiazolyl blue) (Sigma) in 1× PBS was added per well, and after 5 h 100 μl of 10% SDS in 0.1 n HCl was used to solubilize the precipitated crystals. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, A-570 nm was detected. Concentrations of E. coli-expressed scIL-5 or mutant proteins were determined by Western blot analysis and by quantitative IL-5 ELISA using the monoclonal antibodies 24G9 (20Ames R.S. Tornetta M.A. McMillan L.J. Kaiser K.F. Holmes S.D. Appelbaum E. Cusimano D.M. Theisen T.W. Gross M.S. Jones C.S. Silverman C. Porter T.G. Cook R.M. Bennet D. Chaiken I.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6355-6364PubMed Google Scholar) and TRFK-5 (R & D Systems). Kinetic and equilibrium constants for the interaction between hIL-5Rα and E. coli-expressed scIL-5 were measured using a BIAcore optical biosensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). To detect receptor binding of scIL-5 and variants, shIL-5Rα-Fc was immobilized directly onto the biosensor CM5 chip using EDC/NHS chemistry (6Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc . Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Conditions for immobilization and the sensor assay were the same as in Morton et al. (6Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I. Proc . Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein samples from 0 to 100 nm were passed over the shIL-5Rα-Fc surface. Sensorgram data were represented visually by linearized plots as described before (23Morton T. Bennett D.B. Appelbaum E.R. Cusimano D.M. Johanson K.O. Matico R.E. Young P.R. Doyle M. Chaiken I.M. J. Mol. Recognit. 1994; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For the calculation of rate constants, the linear portions of the association and dissociation phases of sensorgrams obtained for a series of scIL-5 or different variant concentrations were calculated by fitting these data to a two-component model, A + B ⇉ AB, to yield an association rate constant k on and a dissociation rate constant k off. K d values were determined from ratios ofk off/k on(23). The dissociation rate constant k off was calculated by fitting dissociation phase data to the equation, ln(Ro/R)=koff(t−to)Equation 1 The association rate constant k on was calculated by fitting association phase data to the equation, dR/dt=kon[C]Rmax−(kon[C]+koff)REquation 2 where R o is the response at the start of dissociation; t is the independent variable, time in seconds; t 0 is the start time for the dissociation or association; R max is the maximum response; and [C] is the molar concentration of scIL-5 or mutant proteins. We constructed an expression vector, pMK-scIL-5, in which scIL-5 was fused to apelB leader sequence under the control of a lacZpromoter (Fig. 1 A). Soluble scIL-5 was detected in the media after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, as expected for recombinant proteins that are expressed and secreted into the periplasm. In contrast, no soluble form of the dimeric wtIL-5 could be detected in the supernatant using a similar construct (pMK-IL-5). The purified, E. coli-expressed scIL-5 protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealing a single band approximately 30 kDa. The interaction between E. coli-expressed recombinant scIL-5 and IL-5Rα was measured using a BIAcore optical biosensor assay. Fig.2 shows sensorgrams of the specific binding of shIL-5Rα-Fc to scIL-5. Analysis of data from the early association phase (from 0 to 50 s) and the first 100 s of the dissociation phase yielded k on andk off values and consequentK d. The linear portions of the association phases were fitted to give a k on of 7.0 × 105m−1 s−1 (Fig. 2,B and C). The initial portion of the dissociation phase of the 100 nm sensorgram was fitted to Equation 1 to give a k off value of 7.0 × 10−3 s−1 (Fig. 2 D). The ratio ofk off/k on yielded aK d value of 10.0 nm. These rates and consequent K d are comparable with the proteins of COS-expressed wtIL-5 and scIL-5 (12Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2088062943,"The molecular chaperone GroEL is a protein complex consisting of two rings each of seven identical subunits. It is thought to act by providing a cavity in which a protein substrate can fold into a form that has no propensity to aggregate. Substrate proteins are sequestered in the cavity while they fold, and prevented from diffusion out of the cavity by the action of the GroES complex, that caps the open end of the cavity. A key step in the mechanism of action of GroEL is the transmission of a conformational change between the two rings, induced by the binding of nucleotides to the GroEL ring opposite to the one containing the polypeptide substrate. This conformational change then leads to the discharge of GroES from GroEL, enabling polypeptide release. Single ring forms of GroEL are thus predicted to be unable to chaperone the folding of GroES-dependent substrates efficiently, since they are unable to discharge the bound GroES and unable to release folded protein. We describe here a detailed functional analysis of a chimeric GroEL protein, which we show to exist in solution in equilibrium between single and double ring forms. We demonstrate that whereas the double ring form of the GroEL chimera functions effectively in refolding of a GroES-dependent substrate, the single ring form does not. The single ring form of the chimera, however, is able to chaperone the folding of a substrate that does not require GroES for its efficient folding.

The chaperonins or HSP60 proteins are essential for cell growth ( 1The abbreviations LDHlactate dehydrogenasemMDHmitochondrial malate dehydrogenaseDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ). In vivo, they assist in the folding of newly synthesized or stress denatured proteins (for recent reviews, see Refs.2Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

It facilitates protein folding in vivo together with its protein co-factor GroES. GroEL has 14 identical 57-kDa subunits, organized in two heptameric rings stacked back to back with a central cavity in each ring. The arrangement of the subunits and the size of the cavity change dramatically in the presence of nucleotide and GroES (5Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.-L.

Biol. 1997; 4: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein folding is thought to take place within this cavity. Detailed in vitro studies of the ATPase activity of GroEL, and GroEL-mediated protein refolding, suggest that the double ring structure and the transmission of allosteric information between the rings are key features of the mechanism by which the chaperone acts. Unfolded or partially folded substrate protein is thought to bind to the apical region of one of the two rings. The subsequent binding of ATP and GroES to the same ring induces a structural reorientation of the subunits, creating a cis-complex where the bound protein has been discharged into the central cavity, which is sealed by GroES. The protein folds in this cavity, where unfavorable hydrophobic interactions with other unfolded proteins are prevented. The protein remains trapped by the GroES co-factor until the binding of ATP to the opposite (trans) ring releases GroES. This binding cannot take place until the slow hydrolysis of ATP on the cis ring has occurred, which also primes the GroES for release (10Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In vitro, GroEL can assist the refolding of some substrate proteins without the aid of GroES. The mechanism of GroES independent refolding is not clearly understood. lactate dehydrogenase mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ATP binding and hydrolysis is an intrinsic part of the mechanism by which GroEL functions. GroEL shows two levels of cooperativity for the binding and hydrolysis of ATP: positive cooperativity between the subunits of each ring and negative cooperativity between the two rings (11Gray T.E. Fersht A.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Boil. 1994; 243: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Yifrach O.

According to the model of nested cooperativity (12Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Boil. 1994; 243: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Yifrach O. Horovitz A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7083-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the subunits in each ring are in equilibrium between a T-state (with high affinity for unfolded polypeptides, and low affinity for ATP) and an R-state (with low affinity for protein and high affinity for ATP). In the absence of nucleotide the subunits of both rings are mostly in the T-state, forming a symmetricalTT-state. Binding of ATP to one ring induces a concerted transition of all the seven subunits in that ring to anR-state, while those in the other ring remain in theT-state, resulting in an asymmetrical TR form. With increasing ATP concentration the negative cooperativity between the rings is overcome and the binding of ATP to the second ring induces a second transition so that a symmetrical R′R′-state is reached. The designation R′ indicates that the catalytical properties of the R-states in the TR andR′R′ form are not identical. The role of the double ring structure has been examined by several groups, using a single ring GroEL mutant (10Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L.

According to the model described above, a single ring form of GroEL should not show GroES-dependent chaperone activity, as the bound GroES would never be released and the substrate protein would stay sequestered beneath it. Studies on a single ring mutant of GroEL have indeed shown this to be the case (10Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). It was shown that although proteins continue to fold in the cavity of the single ring after ATP and GroES binding, they cannot be released except under special experimental conditions like a cold shock or high salt concentrations (15Weissman J.S.

Hartl F.U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This provides strong evidence for the above model, but it could be argued that because a number of mutations have to be introduced to obtain single rings (15Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), these mutants may be defective in chaperone function for other unknown reasons. It has also been shown that mini-chaperones cannot mediate the refolding of GroES-dependent substrates, again reinforcing the requirement for the complete double ring structure for GroEL/GroES-mediated folding of proteins. Only in the case of mammalian mitochondrial Hsp60 is there convincing evidence that the protein can act as a chaperone when in the single ring form. However, it can only interact with its own Hsp10 and not with GroES, indicating that there may be quite a distinct mechanism for chaperone activity in this case (23Nielsen K.L. Cowan N.J. Molecular Cell. 1998; 2: 93-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We recently described the construction of a series of chimeric GroEL proteins (24Jones S. Wallington E.J. George R. Lund P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and reported that a number of these proteins were able to support growth as the sole GroEL protein in Escherichia coli but nevertheless appeared to exist as single rings when analyzed by native gel electrophoreses. A single amino acid residue crucial for ring-ring interactions in most GroEL homologues was identified, and mutation of this residue enabled us to obtain pairs of GroEL proteins differing only at this position but with very different mobilities on native polyacrylamide gels. We report here the detailed characterization of one of these pairs of chimeras and show that, in further support of the above model, the single ring form of the chimeric protein cannot chaperone the folding of a GroES-dependent substrate, whereas the double ring form can. The folding of a GroES independent substrate, however, is not affected by the state of oligomerization of the two rings. E. coli strains were grown in L-broth with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), carbenicillin (200 μg/ml), and (unless otherwise indicated) 0.2% (w/v) arabinose. Chimeric groELgenes were created and expressed from the pBAD promoter as described (24Jones S. Wallington E.J. George R. Lund P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Chromosomal groEL genes were deleted by P1 transduction from a strain that had a precise replacement of thegroEL gene with the nptII gene from Tn5 (25Ivic A. Olden D. Wallington E.J. Lund P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 195: 1-8Google Scholar). Strains carrying ΔgroEL::nptII are referred to as AI90 plus the name of the complementing plasmid. Complementation was tested in these strains and in SF103, which was made by P1 transduction of the groEL44 allele from CG2241 (a gift from C. Georgopoulos) into TG1. SF103 does not grow at 42 °C unless functional GroEL is expressed from a plasmid. To assay complementation, overnight cultures of strains with a groEL44 or a ΔgroEL genotype, containing plasmids expressing wild type or chimeric groEL genes, were diluted, spotted onto plates, and incubated at 37 and 42 °C (groEL44 derivatives) or on plates containing dilutions of arabinose (ΔgroELderivatives). Growth was scored after 24 h. incubation. Bovine lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)1 and porcine heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (mMDH) were obtained from Sigma.E. coli GroES was a generous gift from A. R. Clarke (University of Bristol). GroEL and GroEL chimeric proteins were isolated as described by Yifrach and Horovitz (12Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol.

Pure GroEL or chimeric chaperone protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.6 m NaCl in buffer B. Pure fractions as judged from SDS-PAGE were combined and concentrated using a Centriplus concentrator (Amicon, cutoffM r = 30,000), rebuffered by passing over a Bio-Rad Econo-PacI0 DG column equilibrated with storage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm DTT) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Chaperonin concentration was determined according to Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) using defatted bovine serum albumin as standard. GroES concentration was measured using the extinction coefficient of 3440m−1 cm−1 for protomers (28Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H.

Concentrations of GroEL chimeras are given with respect to tetradecamers, the concentrations of mMDH and LDH with respect to monomers. Refolding of mMDH was performed as in Ranson et al.

Refolding was initiated by dilution into refolding buffer (50 mm triethylammonium, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT) to a final concentration of 150 nm. If refolding was measured in the presence of cofactors, the final concentrations were 150 nmchaperonin oligomer (unless otherwise indicated), 2 mm ATP, and a 4-fold excess GroES oligomer to GroEL oligomer. Chaperonins, GroES, and ATP were added to the standard buffer directly before initiating refolding. To measure refolding, aliquots were removed from the refolding mixture and mMDH activity was determined by adding them to a solution containing 0.2 mm NADH and 1 mmketomalonate. Consumption of NADH by mMDH was assayed by observing the decrease in absorption at 340 nm over 120 s in a Shimadzu UV1601 spectrophotometer. All assays were carried out at 30 °C. Porcine LDH refolding was measured as described (30Clarke A.R. Waldman A.D.B. Munro I. Holbrook J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 828: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. LDH was denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (pH 3.2) for 15 min at room temperature. If not indicated otherwise, renaturation was initiated by dilution into buffer (0.1 mNaH2PO4, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm KCl, and 10 mmMgCl2) to a final concentration of 150 nm LDH. If LDH refolding was measured in the presence of chaperonins and ATP the final concentrations of chaperonin and ATP were 150 nm(if not indicated otherwise) and 2 mm, respectively. Chaperonins and ATP were added to the buffer directly before the refolding was initiated. Aliquots were taken and added to a solution of 0.2 mm NADH and 2.25 mm pyruvate in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7. NADH oxidation by active LDH was observed by monitoring the decrease in absorption at 340 nm over 120 s in a Shimadzu UV16010 spectrophotometer. The ATPase activity of GroEL and the chimeric proteins were measured as described by Horovitz et al.(31Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Kovalenko O. Girshovich A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Initial velocity of ATP hydrolysis as a function of the ATP concentration by wild type GroEL and Cpn60-1 was fitted to Equation 1 derived by Yifrach and Horovitz (13Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) for a three-state nested allosteric model, VO=[0.5Vmax(1)L1([S]/KR)(1+[S]/KR)N­1+Vmax(2)L1L2([S]/KR)(1+[S]/KR)2N­1]/[1+L1(1+[S]/KR)N+L1L2(1+[S]/KR)2N]Equation 1 where L 1 and L 2are the apparent allosteric constants for the transitions TT→ TR and TR → R′R′,K R is the dissociation constant of ATP for rings in the R form, and V 1 andV 2 are the maximal initial velocities of theTR- and R′R′-states. [S] is the ATP concentration. Cooperativity in ATP hydrolysis by P211 at high protein concentration (150 nm) and by P211T101R were analyzed by directly fitting initial ATPase velocity to the simplified nested cooperativiy equation below (12Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Boil. 1994; 243: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) assuming that the TT-state can be ignored, VO=[0.5Vmax(1)[S]+Vmax(2)L2[S](1+[S]/KR)N]/[KR+KRL2(1+[S]/KR)N+1]Equation 2 with the same parameters as before. Cooperativity in ATP hydrolysis by P211 at low enzyme concentration (50 nm) was analyzed by directly fitting initial ATPase velocity to the Hill equation, VO=VmaxK[S]n/(1+K[S]n)Equation 3 where V o and V max are the initial and maximal initial ATPase velocity, [S] is the ATP concentration, K is the apparent ATP binding constant, andn is the Hill coefficient. We have used homologous recombination in vivo to generate chimeric GroEL proteins between the GroEL protein of E. coli and the GroEL homologue Cpn60-1 from the root nodulating bacterium Rhizobium leguminosarum. One such chimeric chaperone, referred to as P211, contains the amino acid sequence from GroEL from position 1 to 364, and the sequence from Cpn60-1 from position 365 to 547. As we reported earlier (24Jones S. Wallington E.J. George R. Lund P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), purified P211 protein migrates on native gradient PAGE gels with an apparent molecular mass of 380 kDa (by comparison with native molecular mass markers), unlike GroEL or Cpn60-1, which run with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 800 kDa (Fig.1). This is consistent with P211 running as a single ring. We also purified the mutant P211T101R, which is identical with P211 but with an arginine replacing threonine at position 101 (24Jones S. Wallington E.J. George R. Lund P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This amino acid is crucial for the formation of a double ring structure in Cpn60-1 and re-establishes a double ring structure in the chimera (24Jones S. Wallington E.J. George R. Lund P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Consequently purified P211T101R runs on native gels with the same molecular mass as wild type GroEL (Fig.1) To investigate the properties of the chimeric proteins in vivo, we deleted the chromosomal groEL gene from strains where P211, P211T101R, or GroEL were expressed on plasmids from the pBAD promoter, which is activated in the presence of arabinose by the AraC protein (32Guzman A. Beli D. Carson M.J. Bechwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3959) Google Scholar). The strains expressing P211 and P211T101R grew in liquid media in the presence of arabinose at both 37 and 43 °C (Ref. 24Jones S. Wallington E.J. George R. Lund P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar and data not shown). However, at 43 °C strains expressing P211 grew at approximately half the rate of those expressing P211T101R or wild type GroEL. We carried out further studies monitoring growth of the strains on solid media at different concentrations of inducer. The results (Table I) show that at lower arabinose concentrations (< 0.01%) the growth of the groELdeletion strain expressing P211 (AI90/pBAD211) is reduced and at an arabinose concentration of 0.005% growth is completely abolished, in contrast to the same strains expressing GroEL (AI90/pBAD50) or P211T101R (AI90/pBAD211T101R), which still grow under these conditions. These results indicate that cells require a higher concentration of P211 than they do of GroEL or P211T101R for growth, even under non-heat shock conditions. We also examined the ability of the strains to plate the GroEL-dependent bacteriophage λ using strain SF103 (carrying the groELts44 allele) expressing GroEL, P211, or P211T101R from the groE promoter, together with GroES, on derivatives of the plasmid pMa5.8 (33Stanssens P. Opsomer C. McKeown Y.M. Kramer W. Zabeau M. Fritz H.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4441-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage λ plated on SF103/pMa211 with an efficiency of 0.16 relative to the wild type control SF103/pMa50, whereas λ plated on SF103/pma211T101R with approximately the same efficiency as the wild type control. From these in vivo results we conclude that P211 can function in vivo, but is somewhat less effective than wild type E. coli GroEL protein or P211T101R.Table IComparison of the abilities of GroEL and the chimeric chaperones to support growth in E. coliStrain/plasmidCell growth at 37 °C in the presence of arabinose at0.2 %0.02 %0.01 %0.005 %AI90/pBAD501111AI90/pBAD21 T101R0.890.830.950.73AI90/pBAD2110.850.600.08<0.01Overnight cultures were diluted and plated on different combinations of arabinose as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the number of colonies scored after overnight incubation.

Figures are expressed as a proportion of the number of colonies of AI90/pBAD50 at 0.2% arabinose. The results from the in vivoexperiments led us to ask whether the P211 chimera is indeed able to act as a single ring, or whether double rings are required for chaperone activity despite its appearance as a single ring on native gels. We used analysis of the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by P211 and P211T101R to probe for possible inter-ring communication in the proteins under the same conditions as those used for carrying out protein refolding assays. The initial velocity of ATP hydrolysis by wild type GroEL as a function of the ATP concentration shows a very characteristic curve (Fig.2 a, inset). Two transitions are observed in this curve, which correspond to the two levels of cooperativity, one between subunits in the same ring and the second between the two rings (12Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Boil. 1994; 243: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 14Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7083-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A very similar curve was seen for Cpn60-1. 2R. George and P. A. Lund, unpublished data. Initial rates of ATP hydrolysis by P211 at a concentration of 50 nm with respect to tetradecamer were measured over a range of ATP concentrations, from 0 to 0.8 mm (Fig. 2 A). In contrast to GroEL, only a simple sigmoid curve was seen, and no indication of a second transition was detected even when ATP hydrolysis was measured at 2.5 mMATP (data not shown). The data were directly fitted to the Hill equation. The value of the Hill coefficient for the allosteric transition was found to be 2.04 (± 0.134) indicating positive cooperativity between the seven subunits in a single ring. Thus, at 50 nm P211, no indication of any ring-ring interaction was detectable indicating that P211 exists predominately in a single ring form at this concentration. Dramatically different results were obtained if the initial velocity of ATP hydrolysis was measured using 150 nm P211 over an ATP concentration range from 0 to 2.5 mm. The resulting curve (Fig. 2 B) has two transition points, indicating two levels of cooperativity, even though the overall shape of the curve is very different from the curve for GroEL. The reappearance of a double transition indicates that at high protein concentrations the double ring structure of P211 is restored and allosteric communication between the rings can take place. These findings suggest strongly that P211 exits in equilibrium between a single and a double ring structure, with the double ring form predominating at higher protein concentrations. The data were then fitted to Equation 2. The allosteric transition constant L 2 for the TR to theR′R′-state for P211 was found to be 2 (± 0.5) × 10−5. This is significantly higher than for GroEL whereL 2 is found to be 6 (± 3.2) × 10−9; this indicates weaker inter-ring communication in the P211 double ring structure compared with GroEL. The data for ATP hydrolysis by P211 (150 nm) at ATP concentrations from 0 to 600 nm were fitted to the Hill equation. The Hill coefficient was 1.21 (± 0.141) in contrast to a Hill coefficient of 2.04 found for the single transition observed at 50 nmP211. Thus the formation of the double ring structure not only restores inter-ring communication but also leads to a decrease of the cooperativity between the seven subunits of each ring. The values ofk cat for the TR andR′R′-state obtained from this fit and calculated for 7 and 14 sites, respectively, are 0.0298 (± 0.0015) s−1 and 0.0224 (± 0.0012) s−1. These differ from thek cat values for GroEL which we found to be 0.141 (± 0.0024) s−1 for the TR and 0.016 (± 0.00056) s−1 for the R′R′-state, in good agreement with published data (13Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). k cat for theTR-state of P211 is significantly lower than for GroEL and of the same order of magnitude as k cat for theR′R′-state, which accounts for the different overall shape of the curve. For comparison, the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis by the P211T101R protein was measured using 25 nm protein and ATP concentrations from 0 to 800 nm. This protein is expected to have a stable double ring structure, on the basis of its behavior on native gels. The resulting curve (Fig. 3) shows two transitions, indicating that P211T101R has a double ring structure even at this low protein concentration. The overall shape of the curve is very similar to that seen for P211 when this protein is in the double ring form. By fitting the data to Equation 2,L 2 was estimated to be 3.1(± 1.1) × 10−5. As for P211, this is significantly higher than for GroEL, indicating that the cooperativity between the rings in P211T101R is weaker than in GroEL. The values of k cat for the TR and R′R′-state obtained from this fit and calculated for 7 and 14 sites, respec"

While the diversity of transported molecules suggests a mechanism involving broad specificity, there is evidence of significant discrimination within given classes of molecules. One example of this behavior is transport of corticosteroids by the murine mdr1 P-glycoprotein. The presence of hydroxyl groups, associated with specific steroid carbon atoms, regulates the ability of corticosteroids to be transported. This specificity is demonstrated here by experiments measuring the ability of steroids to inhibit drug transport. The results indicate that a keto oxygen associated with the 3- and 20-carbon atoms, as well as a 17-carbon hydroxyl group, each acts to enhance steroidal P-glycoprotein inhibitory activity. Moreover, inhibitory steroids can be used for directed selection of variant cells, expressing mutated P-glycoproteins with a severely impaired ability to transport dexamethasone. The five mutations, reported here, are located within transmembrane domains 4–6, proximal to the cytoplasmic interface. The altered P-glycoproteins exhibit reduced capacity to be inhibited by specific steroids, suggesting decreased capacity to bind these molecules avidly. Studies comparing the relative inhibitory activity of a series of steroids indicate that these mutations alter recognition of the 17α-hydroxyl group and the 20-keto oxygen atom.

Gruol D.J. Newby R.F. Rajah F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The likelihood that steroids are substrates for Pgp-mediated transport is supported by the observations thatmdr1 P-glycoprotein expression leads to reduced intracellular dexamethasone accumulation and inhibition of hormone-dependent gene induction (2Gruol D.J. Bourgeois S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, these effects are reversed by drug transport inhibitors, such as verapamil, RU486 (3Gruol D.J. Zee M.C. Trotter J. Bourgeois S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3088-3091PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gruol D.J. Bourgeois S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 720-727PubMed Google Scholar), and PSC-833. 2D. Gruol, unpublished observation. 2D. Gruol, unpublished observation.However, the phenomenon of Pgp-dependent steroid resistance is restricted at two levels. Glucocorticoid resistance is both gene-specific and steroid-specific. The dual specificity is exemplified by the following. 1) The mdr1, but not the mdr3, Pgp conveys resistance to dexamethasone (54Gruol D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). 2) The degree of resistance to a given steroid is highly dependent upon its structure. The degree of Pgp-dependent resistance to steroids that differ by only a single oxygen atom can be profoundly different. For instance, the presence of a 17α-hydroxyl group is associated with a greater shift in steroid sensitivity. Thus, the relative increase in resistance to cortisol is greater than that for corticosterone, and the shift for dexamethasone greater than 17-desoxydexamethasone (1Bourgeois S. Gruol D.J. Newby R.F. Rajah F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An 11β-hydroxyl group has an even greater effect. Cortexolone is nearly identical to cortisol but lacks an 11β-hydroxyl group. No evidence of increased resistance to cortexolone was observed, suggesting that it is not efficiently transported. Similarly, there is evidence that progesterone, which does not have any hydroxyl groups in its structure, is not transported (1Bourgeois S. Gruol D.J. Newby R.F. Rajah F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Yang C.-P.H. Cohen D. Greenberger L.M. Hsu S.I.-H. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18753-18756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is evident that progesterone can bind to Pgp, even if it is not transported. In general, the relative ability of steroids to reverse drug resistance and inhibit drug binding to Pgp has been found to be highly dependent upon the hydrophobicity of the individual steroids (7Yang C.-P.H.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4820-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This behavior suggests a lack of specificity in the interactions between the hormone and the protein but may also reflect the relative ability of the steroids to accumulate within the membranes containing the Pgp. The greater accumulation of the more hydrophobic molecules would be reflected in the local concentration of steroid available to interact with the Pgp. There is very little evidence indicating the region(s) of the Pgp that interact with steroids. One mutation, S941F, in the second half of the murinemdr1 Pgp (transmembrane domain 11), was found to affect the ability of progesterone to serve as an inhibitor of drug transport (9Gros P. Dhir R.

In many cases, the resistance to one drug may increase while the resistance to others either changes or remains the same. Altering a given amino acid in multiple ways can produce profoundly different changes in the drug resistance profiles. In addition, trying to relate changes in resistance to altered drug binding can produce unanticipated results. The mutation G185V in the human Pgp causes increased colchicine resistance and decreased vinblastine resistance. However, this mutation was also reported to cause a decrease in colchicine binding affinity and an increase in vinblastine binding affinity (33Safa A.R. Stern R.K. Choi K. Agresti M. Tamai I. Mehta N.D. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7225-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It would be very valuable to have a methodical means to identify mutations that alter the interaction of specific drugs with Pgp. The work presented here represents our progress in developing such an approach with steroid inhibitors. It focuses upon the isolation of cell lines expressing murine mdr1 Pgp that contain mutations that decrease the ability of steroids to act as transport inhibitors. The overall assumption is that the ability to inhibit drug transport primarily reflects the ability of the steroid to bind to the Pgp at a mechanistically important region of the protein. The results indicate that steroids interact with the Pgp at a site involving transmembrane domains 4–6. Moreover, the mutations appear to affect the protein's interaction with specific steroid structural features.

All of the cell lines were grown in suspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The incubator was maintained at 37 °C and had a humidified atmosphere of 13% CO2 and 87% air. Independent selections were initiated by the mutagenesis of MS23 cells withN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, obtained from Sigma. This compound is an alkylating agent that predominantly causes point mutations.N-Methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (2 μg/ml for 2 h) was used based on previous results with this compound and WEHI-7 cells (36Gruol D.J. Dalton D.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After allowing sufficient time for the cells to recover and express the mutated genes (usually 4–5 days), the cells were dispensed into multiwell dishes (1 × 105cells/well) in medium containing a toxic drug and the P-glycoprotein inhibitor 5β-pregnane-17α-ol-3,20-dione (5βPodo). Three independent mutagenesis/selection experiments have been carried out. In the first, the variant was selected in 3 μm puromycin and 20 μm 5βPodo. In the second and third selections, the variants were isolated from the combination of 3 μmpuromycin and 10 μm 5βPodo. Resistant colonies typically appeared between 12 and 18 days. Each of the variant lines was initially tested for changes in growth in the presence of dexamethasone (10 and 30 nm) relative to MS23 cells. The results of these evaluations identified those variants that had lost significant steroid resistance. The effect of drugs on cell proliferation was measured as described previously (37Gruol D.J. Rajah F.M. Bourgeois S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell cultures were set up (5 × 104 cells/ml) in varied concentrations of drugs and incubated for 7 days. The amount of accumulated cellular material was assayed by measuring the turbidity of the cultures (660 nm) and by expressing the values as normalized to those from cultures grown in the absence of drug. These relative turbidity values reflect the amount of cellular material synthesized during the period of incubation and provide a sensitive measure of the capacity of the cells to proliferate, even if a large portion of them are killed. Typically, relative turbidity values of <5% represent situations where all of the cells have lost viability. The LC50 value is defined as the concentration of drug that produces a relative turbidity value of 50%. The relative ability of nontoxic pregnanes to reverse P-glycoprotein-dependent drug resistance in cells was evaluated as follows. A series of cultures (5 × 104cells/ml) were grown with a fixed concentration of a toxic drug, to which that cell line is normally resistant based upon its P-glycoprotein expression. Increasing concentrations of the pregnane were included in the culture medium, and the relative turbidity values of the cultures were evaluated after 7 days. The inhibitory efficiency of the pregnane is expressed by an EC50 value defined as the concentration of chemosensitizer that reduces the relative turbidity value to 50%. The steroids used were obtained from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI). All steroids were assessed, by Steraloids, as a uniform single spot on TLC with >98% purity. Total cellular RNA was prepared as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). A modification of the PCR-based method, rapid amplification of cDNA ends, was used to evaluate the 5′ sequence of the mdr1 mRNA (39Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. 1st Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 28-38Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized by primer extension from total RNA isolated from MS23 cells using a primer (P1) that overlaps a portion of the exon 2 sequence, CCTGCTGTTGGCGTATTTGGGATGTTTC. After heat-inactivating the reverse transcriptase, the primer was removed from the sample using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). A poly(dA) tail was added to the 5′ end of the cDNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, 33 units/20-μl reaction (Life Technologies, Inc.). The sample was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and the cDNA was precipitated with ethanol. PCR amplification of the cDNA was carried out using a primer (P2) that overlaps another portion of exon 2, GGGAAGAGCAGACAAGAACTTCTCGAAGATG, and the primer (P3), GCTCTAGACTCGAGTCGACATCGT17. The PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and evaluated by direct DNA sequencing using primer P2 (fmol DNA Sequencing System; Promega, Madison, WI). The sequencing reactions were subjected to electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide urea gels, and the resulting gels were analyzed by autoradiography. RT-PCR was used to generate a series of overlapping cDNA fragments encompassing the entire coding sequence of themdr1 gene expressed in MS23 and the variant cell lines: MSPP-1, MSPP-7, MSPP-13, and MSPP-17. Five larger primary fragments (A–E) were initially produced, and a series of subfragments (A1–A4; B1–B4, C1–C3; D1–D3) were generated using a set of nested primers.

All primers were obtained from Life Technologies (Life Technologies, Inc.). The murine mdr1 gene was introduced into a modified version of the pMT2 (40Wong G.G. Witek J.S. Temple P.A. Wilkens K.M.

The mdr1 gene in the pMTmdr vector was also modified to include the change G to T at nucleotide 692 of the coding sequence. A 1606-bp fragment of the mdr1 gene was removed from the pMTmdr vector using AflII andApaI and cloned into the Litmus 39 vector (New England Biolabs). The resulting construct (Lit39-mdr/AfAp) was amplified, purified, and digested with SacI and BglII to remove a 715-bp portion of the mdr/AfAp insert. This subfragment was replaced with a similar 715-bp fragment containing the mutation G to T at nucleotide 692 of the coding sequence. This is the mutation that was found in samples from the MSPP-1 cells. The mutated 715-bp fragment was generated as follows. RT-PCR with RNA from MSPP-1 cells was used to generate a 788-bp fragment of the mdr1 gene encompassing nucleotides 469–1256 of the coding sequence. This was carried out with the primers CAGGAGATAGGCTGGTTTGATGTG and CCGCTCTTCACCTTCAGATTGAGG. The fragment was purified and used in a second PCR amplification using nested primers, TGATGTGCATGATGTTGGGGAGC and CCCTTCAAGATCTGAACTTCGCTTC. The resulting 747-bp fragment was digested with SacI andBglII to generate the appropriate 715-bp fragment of themdr1 gene to ligate into the opened Lit39-mdr/AfAp vector. The mdr1 portion of the reconstituted Lit39-mdr/AfAp vector was sequenced to verify that no mutations other than the G to T at nucleotide 692 had been introduced. The reconstituted Lit39-mdr/AfAp vector was digested with AflII and ApaI to release the entire 1606-bp mdr1 fragment that was reintroduced into the opened pMTmdr vector. The resulting vector was designated as pMTmdr-692. Purified pMTmdr and pMTmdr-692 plasmids were linearized by digestion with the enzyme AhdI and used to transfect the human HEK 293T cell line by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. HEK 293T cells exhibiting increased drug resistance were isolated by exposing the cells to 6 μm puromycin. A colony of resistant cells obtained using the pMTmdr plasmid was isolated and designated as 293Twt-3. A colony of resistant cells obtained using the pMTmdr-692 plasmid was isolated and designated as 293T-801-3. These cells have increased resistance to puromycin and vincristine but not to actinomycin D. RNA samples from HEK 293T, 293Twt-3, and 293T-801-3 cells were evaluated for evidence of murine mdr1 expression using RT-PCR to generate amplified cDNA fragments (42Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. 1st Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 21-27Crossref Google Scholar). Only the transfected cell lines had expression of the mdr1 gene, and sequence analysis confirmed the expression of the normal and mutated genes in the 293Twt-3 and 293T-801-3 cells, respectively. Measurements of steroid accumulation in intact cells were carried out by a method outlined elsewhere (2Gruol D.J. Bourgeois S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, lymphoid cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended (1 × 107 cells/ml) in fresh medium.3H-Labeled dexamethasone was added (2 × 10−8m final concentration), and the samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After the incubation period, the cells were washed free of unbound hormone using cold (0 °C) phosphate-buffered saline. Retained hormone was measured with a scintillation counter. Steroids can serve as substrates for Pgp efflux and/or inhibitors of drug transport (4Gruol D.J. Bourgeois S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 720-727PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that the hydrophobicity of steroids is a strong determinant in their ability to inhibit drug transport (7Yang C.-P.H. Goei DePinho S. Greenberger L.M. Arceci R.J. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 782-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Barnes K.M. Dickstein B. Cutler Jr., G.B. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4820-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We have chosen to look further into this issue using a circumscribed set of steroids, a series of 5β-pregnane compounds containing a progressively increasing number of oxygen atoms. This class of molecules was chosen because its members do not contain a double bond in the steroid A-ring, a property that prevents them from binding to glucocorticoid receptors with a significant affinity. Consequently, 5β-pregnanes do not serve as activators of the glucocorticoid receptor, an important consideration when using a cell line (MS23) that undergoes apoptosis in response to the hormone. Fig.1 illustrates the results of an experiment comparing the ability of four pregnane compounds to reverse puromycin resistance in the MS23 cell line. MS23 cells express themdr1 Pgp (1Bourgeois S. Gruol D.J. Newby R.F. Rajah F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and are more resistant to puromycin (LC50 ∼9.0 μm) compared with the Pgp-deficient parental line W7TB (LC50 ∼1.5 μm). In this experiment, all of the MS23 cultures were grown in 3 μm puromycin, and the concentration of the pregnane compounds was varied. 5β-Pregnane, the most hydrophobic of the series, had no significant effect on the growth of the cells up to a concentration of 20 μm. 5β-Pregnane-3-one was more effective (EC50 ∼10 μm), followed by 5β-pregnane 3,20-dione (EC50 ∼3 μm). 5β-Pregnane-17α-ol-3,20-dione (EC50 ∼0.8 μm) was the most effective at reversing puromycin resistance. Thus, for this series of compounds, the increased potential of the steroid to make hydrogen bonding interactions enhanced the ability to block the transporter. We have observed a similar pattern for these compounds in their ability to increase accumulation of dexamethasone and daunomycin in mdr1-expressing cell lines (data not shown). These results, along with the specificity seen in the capacity of the mdr1 Pgp to convey glucocorticoid resistance (2Gruol D.J. Bourgeois S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggest that the protein may make discriminating interactions with defined steroid structural elements. If this interpretation is correct, it implies the existence of a steroid binding site and suggests that it may be possible to identify Pgp mutations that alter the recognition of specific steroid features. There are two examples in which Pgp expression, in murine cell lines, resulted from transcription directed by promoters that are not normally utilized (43Lepage P. Devault A. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7380-7392Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Gros and colleagues (43Lepage P. Devault A. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7380-7392Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) found evidence ofmdr3 expression involving murine mammary tumor virus and intracisternal A-particle elements in the mouse genome. In both cases, the normal 5′-untranslated portion of the mdr3 mRNA was altered to include retroviral long terminal repeat sequence through changes in the normal patterns of initiation and splicing. Fig.2 illustrates the results of a rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis of the 5′ portion of themdr1 mRNA expressed in the MS23 cells. The data demonstrate that the first mdr1 exon (untranslated) has been replaced by intracisternal A-particle sequence. This finding suggests that the mdr1 Pgp expression in MS23 cells is the result of an infrequent event and is, therefore, likely to be produced from only one copy of the gene. If this is the case, mutations in that gene should result in unambiguous phenotypic changes in the drug resistance profile, not obscured by a presence of the normal form of the protein. The observations described above suggest a strategy for isolating MS23 variants expressing Pgp with altered ability to be inhibited by pregnanes. Usually, the presence of a toxic drug and pregnane inhibitor will result in cell death, since the inhibitor reverses drug resistance. If the pregnane inhibitor is ineffective (due to a mutation that alters steroid binding), the cells will retain their resistance and survive. Moreover, the cells expressing such a Pgp mutation should display a distinctive phenotype. The MS23 variants will have reduced resistance to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. In an effort to isolate variants expressing mutated Pgp, a sample of mutagenized MS23 cells was exposed to the combination of puromycin 5βPodo for 21 days. A single resistant clone of cells was obtained and designated as MSPP-1. The growth of this variant represents a frequency of survival of 5 × 10−8. Fig.3 depicts the drug resistance profile of MSPP-1 cells compared with W7TB and MS23 cells. Fig. 3 Ademonstrates that there was a complete reversal of dexamethasone resistance in the MSPP-1 cells. In comparison, there was no change in the vincristine resistance relative to the MS23 cells (Fig.3 B), nor was there a chang"

Deletion analysis showed that expression of this gene in vegetative cells involves an A/T-rich element, whereas its expression in prespore cells during development requires a region encompassing two G/C-rich elements, designated box A and box B. Removal of boxes A and B results in very low level of activity. When either box A or box B is deleted, prestalk cells adjacent to the prespore zone also express β-galactosidase. The behavior of these cis-regulatory elements implies that the mechanism regulating the prespore-specific expression ofrnrB is different from that regulating other known prespore genes.We have used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to identify factors that interact with box A and box B. Box A interacts with a factor that is found in the nuclear fraction.

Ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. As well, it is involved in maintaining a balanced pool of deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The central role played by ribonucleotide reductase in DNA synthesis has made it an important target for the design of anti-tumor and anti-viral drugs (reviewed in Ref. 2Szekeres T. Fritzer-Szekeres M. Elford H.L. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1997; 34: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, this enzyme comprises two large and two small subunits (3Thelander L. Eriksson S. Akerman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7426-7432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of ribonucleotide reductase is periodic and is coordinated with DNA synthesis in a variety of organisms characterized. An increased level of the small subunit is detected during the S phase of the cell cycle (4Engström Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol.

The expression of ribonucleotide reductase appears to be tightly regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms involved in its regulation is expected to shed additional insights into the control of DNA synthesis and DNA repair and potentially lead to rational drug design. Supplied with ample nutrients, cells of the cellular slime moldDictyostelium discoideum multiply by binary fission as single-celled amoebae. Depletion of food triggers the onset of a 24-h developmental program. The cells come together to form multicellular aggregates 8 h after the initiation of development. By 16 h, the multicellular aggregates called slugs are differentiated along the anterior-posterior axis. Prestalk cells occupy the anterior one-quarter of the slug, and prespore cells are located in the remaining three-quarters. These precursor cells ultimately differentiate into stalk cells and spores of the mature fruiting body. Prior to differentiation, cells in the prespore region undergo a wave of DNA synthesis (13Zimmerman W. Weijer C.J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 160: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Durston A.J. Vork F. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 115: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Zada-Hames I.M. Ashworth J.M.

The role of this developmentally programmed burst of DNA synthesis is unknown. It has been suggested by different investigators to fuel cell division (13Zimmerman W. Weijer C.J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 160: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Durston A.J. Vork F. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 115: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Zada-Hames I.M. Ashworth J.M.

Temporally and spatially correlated with this wave of DNA synthesis is the elevated expression of the gene encoding the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, rnrB (18Tsang A. Bonfils C. Czaika G. Shtevi A. Grant C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As in other organisms, it appears that fluctuations in the expression ofrnrB can be used to predict changes in the rates of DNA synthesis. Altering the pattern of rnrB expression may be used as a tool to change the profile of DNA synthesis in evaluating the role of DNA synthesis in development. Manipulating the regulatory regions of promoters provides a convenient way of changing the pattern of gene expression. The regulatory regions of several genes that are expressed predominantly in prespore cells have been characterized. Most of these promoters contain consensus C/A-rich elements (CAEs), 1The abbreviations CAEC/A-rich elementPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPCRpolymerase chain reaction which have been shown to be important for transcriptional activity (19Powell-Coffman J.A.

Also required is an A/T-rich element located downstream of the CAEs (19Powell-Coffman J.A. Firtel R.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1601-1611PubMed Google Scholar, 20Powell-Coffman J.A. Schnitzler G.R. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5840-5849Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When joined with a heterologous basal promoter, neither the CAEs nor the A/T-rich element alone is able to drive expression in prespore cells. However, expression in prespore cells can be stimulated when the CAEs and the A/T-rich element are placed together with a heterologous basal promoter (19Powell-Coffman J.A. Firtel R.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1601-1611PubMed Google Scholar, 20Powell-Coffman J.A. Schnitzler G.R. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5840-5849Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The CAEs exhibit strong affinity for the developmentally regulated transcriptional factor GBF (24Schnitzler G.R. Fischer W.H. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells carrying a null mutation in the gene encoding GBF are arrested at the loose aggregate stage, before cell differentiation has occurred (24Schnitzler G.R. Fischer W.H. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The latter results provide further evidence that besides the interaction between GBF and CAEs, prespore gene expression requires the interaction with other factors and regulatory elements. C/A-rich element 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid polymerase chain reaction The regulation of rnrB appears to be more complex than that of the other known prespore genes. In addition to expression in prespore cells, it is expressed in vegetative cells. A cursory examination of the G/C-rich sequences in the promoter region ofrnrB shows the absence of known cis-acting elements. Only one G/C-rich sequence in the promoter of rnrBexhibits similarity to half of a C/A-rich element. Here we show by deletion analysis that expression of rnrB in vegetative cells does not require any of the G/C-rich sequences found in the promoter. In addition, we have identified two G/C-rich sequences that can direct prespore expression during postaggregative development. Results from electrophoretic mobility shift experiments suggest that these two G/C-rich sequences interact with factors that are distinct from the transcriptional factor GBF. Cells of the axenic strain AX2 were grown either axenically in HL5 medium (25Ashworth J.M. Watts D.J. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or on lawns of Enterobacter aerogenes on SM agar (26Sussman M. Prescott D. Methods in Cell Physiology. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996: 397-410Google Scholar). At the logarithmic phase, 2–4 × 106cells/ml in HL5 or when the bacterial lawns began to clear, the cells were harvested and washed in ice-cold KKP buffer (20 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 6.2) and allowed to develop on a solid substratum as we have previously described (27Bonfils C. Greenwood M. Tsang A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 139: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs from deletion constructs were introduced into AX2 cells by calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described previously (28Early A. Williams J.G. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected in HL5 containing 20 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Over 50 independent transformants were pooled for analysis. The oligonucleotide 5′-GAGAATTGGTTCAATGAATG-3′, complementary to positions 26–45 of the sense strand of rnrB, was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used as a primer. Approximately 10 fmol of the labeled oligonucleotide, 2 × 103 cpm, were annealed at 41 °C for 16 h to 4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA in a reaction volume of 10 μl containing 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, and 0.4 m NaCl. After annealing, the RNA was transferred to a tube containing the extension reaction mix (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmof each dNTP, 2 μg of actinomycin D, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a final volume of 100 μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The radiolabeled extension product was then resolved alongside a sequencing ladder on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. TheXbaI/BamHI genomic fragment (29Grant C.E. Bain G. Tsang A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5457-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) contains two-thirds of the coding region and 450 base pairs of 5′-noncoding region of rnrB. This fragment was cloned in frame tolacZ into the XbaI/BglII sites of pDdGal16 (30Harwood A.J. Dury L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to generate construct Δ−450. To construct the other 5′ deletions, sequences were progressively removed with Bal31 (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) from the XbaI site. The cleaved DNA fragments were excised with BamHI and cloned into the BglII site and the end-filled HindIII site of pDdGal16. The end points of the deletions, marked in Fig. 1 B, were determined by sequencing using the primer described for primer extension. With the exception of Δ−450, all of the 5′ deletion constructs retained the XbaI–KpnI–EcoRI multiple cloning site of pDdGal16. The 5′ deletion constructs are designated Δ−y, where y refers to the nucleotide at the 5′ deletion end point. Base +1 is the A residue in the initiation codon ATG. To construct the internal deletions, two PCR-amplified fragments corresponding to the 5′ upstream sequence of rnrB were cloned into the XbaI or XbaI/EcoRI sites of the 5′ deletion constructs. The 5′ primer for PCR, 5′-TTACTAGTGAAATACCTGCACCTCC-3′, is complementary to the coding strand of capA, the gene adjacent to rnrB. It contains an added SpeI site for cloning into the XbaI site of the deletion plasmids. The two 3′ primers, each bearing anEcoRI site, are oligonucleotides spanning either box B, 5′-TTGAATTCAAAATACACACACATTCCCG-3′, or box C, 5′-TTGAATTCATGATGGAATCACCGTTCC-3′ (Fig. 1 B). Polymerase chain reaction was performed with ExpandTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the annealing temperature set at 55 °C. The internal deletions are designated −xΔ−y, where x and y indicate the nucleotide at the end point of the 3′ and 5′ deletions, respectively. For construct −444Δ−212, one of the PCR products was digested withSpeI and XbaI and inserted into theXbaI site of construct Δ−212. All other internal deletion constructs do not contain sequences 5′ from the XbaI site. Deletion −292Δ−212 was constructed by inserting theXbaI–EcoRI restriction fragment from the product generated with the PCR primer spanning box B intoXbaI–EcoRI of construct Δ−212, while deletion −359Δ−280 combined the construct Δ−280 with theXbaI–EcoRI fragment from the PCR product generated with the primer spanning box C. For the remaining constructs, individual GC-rich boxes were made with pairs of oligonucleotides designed in such a way that, after annealing, there would be on both sides overhanging ends, GATC, that are compatible with a BglII site. The sequences of the oligonucleotides for reconstituting the boxes are as follows: for box B, 5′-GATCCTTTCGGGAATGTGTGTGTATTA-3′ and 5′-GATCTAATACACACACATTCCCGAAAG-3′; for box C, 5′-GATCCATTGGAACGGTGATTCCATCAA-3′ and 5′-GATCTTGATGGAATCACCGTTCCAATG-3′; and for box D, 5′-GATCCTCTAGAATCGGAGTGGTACCCAAAA-3′ and 5′-GATCTTTTGGGTACCACTCCGATTCTAGAG-3′. The recipient plasmids were Δ−340, Δ−280, and Δ−212. To accommodate the GATC overhang of the annealed oligonucleotides, theXbaI–KpnI–EcoRI sites in the recipient plasmids were replaced withSpeI–BglII–EcoRI, obtained from the multiple cloning site of the vector pPC86 (32Chévray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Constructs −430Δ−340 and DΔ−212 were made by combining box D with the modified Δ−340 and Δ−212, respectively. Constructs BΔ−212 and CΔ−212 were generated by placing boxes B and C in the modified Δ−212. The accumulation of transcript was quantified using dot-blot analysis because on RNA gel thelacZ fusion transcript migrated as a smear similar to that observed in other studies (33Esch R.K. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Barklis E. Pontius B. Barfield K. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted according to Franke et al. (35Franke J. Podgorski G.J. Kessin R.H. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega), and quantified by spectrophotometry. Two dots containing 5 μg of RNA each were spotted onto Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Expression of the rnrB-lacZ fusion was determined by probing the membranes with the lacZ gene using the HindIII–XhoI fragment from pDdGal16. For endogenous rnrB expression, theEcoRI–DraI fragment corresponding to the region of rnrB that was not present in the fusion constructs (18Tsang A. Bonfils C. Czaika G. Shtevi A. Grant C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was used as a probe. All probes were labeled by random priming (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the lacZ probe the membranes were hybridized in Denhardt's solution with 50% formamide for 16 h at 45 °C and washed twice for 20 min each in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. For the rnrB probe, hybridization was conducted at 40 °C for 16 h and washed twice for 20 min each in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. These conditions were determined by Northern blotting to retain specific signals with undetectable background (data not shown). The blots were exposed to a β-imaging screen on a phosphor imager GS-363 (Bio-Rad), and the levels of expression were quantified with Molecular AnalystTM software (Bio-Rad). Cells were grown on bacteria and developed on preboiled nitrocellulose filters resting on KKP-saturated pads at a density of about 2 × 106cells/cm2. At the slug stage, the filters supporting the slugs were fixed in 0.1% glutaraldehyde in Z buffer for 10 min and assayed for β-galactosidase activity (36Dingermann T. Reindl N. Werner H. Hildebrandt M. Nellen W. Harwood A. Williams J.G. Nerke K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped with 3% trichloroacetic acid. The filters were washed in water, mounted on microscopic slides under coverslips, and examined on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a × 10 objective. Pictures were taken on Kodak Royal Gold ASA 25 film. The cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (24Schnitzler G.R. Fischer W.H. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The probes were the oligonucleotides reconstituting boxes A and B as well as CAE-1 (21Haberstroh L. Galindo J. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 113: 947-958PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences for the box A duplex are 5′-GATCCATAGGAACCAAAATTGCGCTAA-3′ and 5′-GATCTTAGCGCAATTTTGGTTCCTATG-3′. The sequences for the box B duplex are listed above. Unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to these sequences along with box C and box D duplexes, also shown above, were used in competition assays. For the binding assays, 10 μg of protein extract were incubated with 3000 cpm of end-labeled probe (0.1–0.5 ng), 500 ng of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 20 μl of 0.25× storage buffer (24Schnitzler G.R. Fischer W.H. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The components were allowed to bind at room temperature for 30 min, immediately applied on a 4.5% acrylamide-TBE gel, and resolved at 4 °C at 140 V until the unbound probe reached the bottom of the gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak X-Omat). Primer extension of the rnrB transcript showed a single product corresponding to 114 base pairs upstream of the ATG initiation codon. This site is preceded by a stretch of T residues that is typical of transcription start sites of D. discoideum genes (Fig.1 B) (37Kimmel A.R. Firtel R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells transformed with the 5′ deletion construct Δ−450 expressedlacZ mRNA with a developmental profile that was indistinguishable from the endogenous rnrB mRNA: moderate level in vegetative cells, low level in early developing cells, and a resurgence of activity in postaggregative cells (Figs.2 A and3 A). Histochemical staining also showed that the spatial expression of β-galactosidase directed by this deletion construct is identical to that of the undeleted control. Therefore, subsequent deletion analysis focused on the region downstream of −450. As observed in other D. discoideumpromoters, the sequence upstream of the rnrB coding region is made up primarily of A/T residues with G/C-rich clusters. The four G/C-rich clusters detected between the translation start codon and −450 are referred to as boxes A, B, C, and D (Fig. 1).Figure 3Summary of the resurgence of transcriptional activity during postaggregative development directed by the deletion constructs. Results of dot blots were quantified. We normalized the transcript level in postaggregative cells by dividing the transcript level in 15 h developing cells by the transcript level in vegetative cells. We scored as strong resurgence of transcriptional activity during postaggregative development (+) in cases where the normalized lacZ transcript level was at least 50% as high as the normalized rnrB transcript level. In cases where thelacZ level was between 25 and 50% that of thernrB message in post-aggregative cells, the resurgence activity was defined as weak (+/−). Finally, constructs directinglacZ levels that were less than 25% that of rnrBwere recorded as having poor resurgence activity (−).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cells carrying constructs extending to −311 or further upstream accumulated lacZ RNA with a profile that was identical to the accumulation of endogenousrnrB mRNA (Figs. 2 A and 3 A). These results suggest that the sequence downstream of −311 is sufficient for both vegetative expression and late resurgence of the transcript. Removing the upstream sequence to −280 did not affect the expression of rnrB/lacZ in vegetative cells or in early developing cells, but the level of rnrB/lacZ transcript in postaggregative cells was about half that of deletion Δ−311. Truncation of the 5′ sequence to −212 eliminated all activity in postaggregative cells, but the regulation in vegetative and early developing cells appeared unaffected (Figs. 2 A and3 A). These results suggest that the sequences encompassing box A, between −280 and −212, and box B, between −311 and −280, are involved in regulating the resurgent activity during late development. While deletion Δ−212 retained rnrB activity in vegetative cells, truncation to −130 abolished all activity (Figs. 2 Aand 3 A), suggesting that the A/T-rich sequence between −130 and −212 is required for activity in vegetative cells. Cells carrying construct −444Δ−212 did not exhibit activity in postaggregative cells (Figs. 2 B and 3 B). Together with results obtained from 5′ deletion analysis, this suggests that the elements regulating the expression of rnrB during late development are located between −444 and −212. Subsequent analysis of internal deletions was focused on the region downstream of −444. Cells transformed with constructs missing box A (deletion −292Δ−212), box B (deletion −359Δ−280), or box C (construct −429Δ−340) exhibited a normal level of reporter transcript during late development (Figs. 2 B and 3 B). Cells transformed with construct −359Δ−212, missing boxes A and B, also expressedlacZ RNA during postaggregative development (Figs.2 B and 3 B). Therefore, while the 5′ deletion analysis shows that the region downstream of −311 is sufficient to promote a normal level of expression, results from internal deletions suggest that the region between −359 and −444 also has a positive effect on transcriptional activity during late development. The 5′ deletion analysis suggested that box A alone was able to drive expression, albeit at low levels, of lacZ RNA during late development. To assess the role of the other discrete elements, we fused oligonucleotides corresponding to the G/C-rich boxes B, C, and D to the minimal promoter Δ−212. Cells transformed with construct BΔ−212, containing box B, showed a resurgence of activity. With construct CΔ−212, bearing box C, no activity was detected in developing cells. Cells carrying construct DΔ−212, containing box D, displayed a low level of activity in late developing cells (Figs.2 B and 3 B). These results provide further evidence that sequences corresponding to boxes A, B, and D can independently activate transcription in late developing cells. Previously, we showed by histochemical staining that cells bearing a plasmid containing the rnrB promoter fused to lacZ-expressed β-galactosidase only in the posterior, prespore zone (18Tsang A. Bonfils C. Czaika G. Shtevi A. Grant C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that deletion constructs that did not express lacZ RNA in postaggregative cells exhibited little or no β-galactosidase activity in slugs (e.g. constructs Δ−212, −444Δ−212, and CΔ−212 (Fig. 4, E, F, and L)). This indicates that the β-galactosidase activity observed in the slugs is directed by lacZ transcript present during this stage of development and is not caused by residual activity held over from vegetative cells. Deletion constructs containing both box A and box B (Δ−311 and −429Δ−340) displayed prespore-specific expression of β-galactosidase activity at the slug stage similar to that of the undeleted construct (Fig. 4, A, B, andI). Constructs carrying either box A or box B alone (Δ−280, −292Δ−212, −359Δ−280, and BΔ−212) exhibited β-galactosidase activity primarily in the prespore zone with some activity in the prestalk region (Fig. 4, C, G,H, and K). However, slugs developed from cells carrying Δ-225, containing the proximal half of box A, exhibited random distribution of β-galactosidase activity (Fig.4 D). The internal deletion constructs that are missing both boxes A and B, −359Δ−212 and DΔ−212, exhibited unexpected results. They directed the expression of lacZ RNA in postaggregative cells (Figs. 2 B and 3 B) but displayed a very low level of β-galactosidase scattered throughout the slugs (Fig. 4,J and M). These results suggest that the RNA expressed by these two constructs during late development is randomly distributed in the slug and is not efficiently translated into β-galactosidase. Results from the deletion analysis revealed that box A and box B are important for spatial and temporal control of rnrB expression during late development. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using oligonucleotides containing these sequences to identify cellular factors that recognize these elements. Fig. 5 A shows the specificity of binding of an oligonucleotide containing box A to factors in nuclear extracts. A 300-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides corresponding to either box B, box C, box D, or CAE-1 did not compete for binding of box A in the fast migrating complex. The factor that interacted with box A specifically was undetectable in nuclear extracts prepared from vegetative cells or from cells developed for 6 h. It was present in cells developed for 12, 15, and 18 h (Fig. 5 B). The presence of this activity in cytosolic extracts could not be assessed because of the presence of a nonspecific complex with similar mobility on the gel shift assay (data not shown). Fig. 6 A shows the presence of a cytosolic factor that exhibits specific binding to the box B oligonucleotide. This factor was effectively competed with unlabeled box B but poorly competed with unlabeled box A, C, or D. It was present in cytosolic extracts from vegetatively growing cells as well as cells from all stages of development (Fig. 6 B). A complex of box B with the same electrophoretic mobility was detected in nuclear extracts. This factor was not detected in the nuclear fractions of vegetative cells or early developing cells, but it was present in the nuclear extracts of cells that had been developed for 12 h or more (Fig. 6 C). The sequence of box B harbors half of a CAE box found in promoters of several cAMP-induced genes (19Powell-Coffman J.A. Firtel R.A.

The CAEs interact specifically with the trans-acting factor GBF (41Hjorth A.L. Khanna N.C. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 747-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), with the element CAE-1 of cotC displaying the highest affinity (39Hjorth A.L. Pears C. Williams J.G. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Competition experiments showed that a 300-fold excess of CAE-1 was about as effective a competitor as 30-fold box B (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 3 and 8). Moreover, box B was a poor competitor for the CAE-1 element (data not shown). These results suggest that the affinity of GBF for box B is low and that box B interacts specifically with a factor that is distinct from GBF. The gene encoding the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase,rnrB, of D. discoideum has an unusual pattern of expression. It is the only gene identified so far that is expressed during vegetative growth, down-regulated during early development, and then expressed at high level in a cell type-specific manner during postaggregative development. We show here that postaggregative expression of rnrB requires controlling elements that are not needed for expression in growing cells. We also did not find repressor elements that could cause a decrease in transcriptional activity during early development. These results therefore suggest that the mechanism regulating the expression of rnrB during growth is different from that controlling its expression during postaggregative development. They also imply that the low level ofrnrB transcript present in early developing cells is the result of a reduced level of transcription and the degradation of transcript synthesized during growth. Deletion analysis of the rnrBpromoter suggests that the region located between −212 and −130, with an A/T content of 96%, is required for expression in vegetative cells. Elements rich in A/T have also been implicated in the regulation of other D. discoideum genes expressed during vegetative growth (40Pavlovic J. Haribabu B. Dottin R.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 4660-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42Hori R. Firtel R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5099-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 43Esch R.K.

J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Moreover, the A/T-rich upstream activating sequence of actin 15 when placed in a developmentally regulated promoter can direct expression in vegetative cells (42Hori R. Firtel R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5099-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hence, the involvement of A/T-rich elements in regulation appears to be a common feature among D. discoideum genes expressed during vegetative growth. However, there is no apparent sequence similarity between the various A/T-rich elements identified, perhaps reflecting the diverse mechanisms of gene regulation during growth phase. Alternatively, these A/T-rich elements may fold into similar structures that interact with related factors. How the expression of prespore-specific genes is regulated in D. discoideum is not well understood. Consensus CAEs are found in promoters of most prespore genes studied to date (19Powell-Coffman J.A. Firtel R.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1601-1611PubMed Google Scholar, 20Powell-Coffman J.A. Schnitzler G.R. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5840-5849Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 47Early A.E. Williams J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6473-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In most instances, the consensus CAEs have been shown to influence the level of activity but do not confer cell type specificity. For example, removal of the CAEs from the promoter of prespore genes drastically reduces the level of expression but does not alter the spatial distribution of the residual activity (19Powell-Coffman J.A. Firtel R.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1601-1611PubMed Google Scholar, 20Powell-Coffman J.A. Schnitzler G.R. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5840-5849Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Haberstroh L. Galindo J. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 113: 947-958PubMed Google Scholar, 47Early A.E. Williams J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6473-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Also consistent with this idea is the observed function of GBF, the transcriptional activator that interacts with CAEs. Binding sites of GBF are found in the promoters of both prespore and prestalk genes (19Powell-Coffman J.A. Firtel R.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1601-1611PubMed Google Scholar, 20Powell-Coffman J.A. Schnitzler G.R. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5840-5849Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Haberstroh L. Galindo J. Firtel R.A.

Cells carrying a null mutation in GBF are arrested at the loose aggregate stage before cell type specification takes place (24Schnitzler G.R. Fischer W.H. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, in certain contexts the CAEs have been shown to affect spatial expression. For example, mutations in one of three CAEs in the promoter of the prespore cotC gene can result in asymmetrical expression within the prespore zone (21Haberstroh L. Galindo J. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 113: 947-958PubMed Google Scholar, 22Haberstroh L. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 596-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Another case is that of the car3 gene, which is expressed throughout the slug, and its promoter harbors two CAEs. Deletion of either of the two CAEs restricts expression to the prespore zone (50Gollop R. Kimmel A.R. Development. 1997; 124: 3395-3405PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that interactions between GBF and transcriptional factors that bind cis-regulatory elements other than CAEs are involved in regulating the expression of cell type-specific genes. The other cis-regulatory elements that may be involved include the A/T-rich elements identified in promoters of several genes expressed in postaggregative cells (19Powell-Coffman J.A. Firtel R.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1601-1611PubMed Google Scholar, 20Powell-Coffman J.A. Schnitzler G.R. Firtel R.A. Mol.

Results presented here suggest that the expression of rnrBin prespore cells involves mechanisms that are distinct from those regulating prespore-specific genes described previously. ThernrB promoter does not possess consensus CAEs. The three G/C-rich regions (boxes A, B, and D) implicated in the expression ofrnrB in postaggregative cells bear no sequence similarity among themselves. Box D supports very low level of activity that is randomly distributed in the slug (Fig. 4 M). Boxes A and B can independently influence expression in prespore cells during postaggregative development. However, constructs containing only one of the two boxes exhibit activity that is lower than those carrying both boxes. In addition, these constructs show ectopic expression with activity transgressing to the prestalk zone (Fig. 4, C,G, H, and K). Internal deletions missing both box A and box B display very low level of activity in postaggregative cells, and the residual activity is randomly distributed in the slug (Fig. 4, J and M). Moreover, deletion of part of box A results in expression throughout the entire slug (Fig. 4 D). These results suggest that prespore-specific expression of rnrB depends on the presence of both box A and box B (Fig. 4, A, B, andI). Unlike the CAEs, therefore, intact box A and box B play a direct role in specifying prespore expression. We are presently testing whether the presence of A/T-rich element(s) is required for expression of the rnrB gene during development like in other postaggregative genes (19Powell-Coffman J.A.

Two transcriptional activators, GBF (24Schnitzler G.R. Fischer W.H. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and STAT (52Kawata T. Shevchenko A. Fukuzawa M.

GBF binds with CAEs, while STAT has been shown to interact with an A/T-rich element of the prestalk geneecmB. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that box A binds to a factor that is present in the nuclear fraction. This factor appears between 6 and 12 h of development (Fig.5 B), a profile consistent with the timing of the resurgence of rnrB transcript (18Tsang A. Bonfils C. Czaika G. Shtevi A. Grant C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The binding of box A to this factor was not affected by the addition of excess CAE-1 (Fig. 5 A) or the STAT-binding site (data not shown). These data suggest that box A interacts with a nuclear factor that has not yet been characterized. Box B interacts with a factor that can be detected in the cytosolic fraction during growth and development. This factor is detected in the nuclear fraction of developing cells but not vegetative cells (Fig.6 B), suggesting that the factor migrates to the nucleus or is modified in the nucleus during development. Box B contains G/T repeats that resemble half of the consensus GBF-binding site. Results from competition assays suggest that box B interacts weakly with GBF (Fig. 6 A). This observation implies that GBF does not have a major role in the regulation of rnrB expression. We thank Zeina Saikali and Abraham Shtevi for technical assistance."
