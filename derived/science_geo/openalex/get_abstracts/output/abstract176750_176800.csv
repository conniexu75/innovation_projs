https://openalex.org/W1977055303,"Linkage of microtubules to special cortical regions is essential for cell polarization. CLIP-170 binds to the growing ends of microtubules and plays pivotal roles in orientation. We have found that IQGAP1, an effector of Rac1 and Cdc42, interacts with CLIP-170. In Vero fibroblasts, IQGAP1 localizes at the polarized leading edge. Expression of carboxy-terminal fragment of IQGAP1, which includes the CLIP-170 binding region, delocalizes GFP-CLIP-170 from the tips of microtubules and alters the microtubule array. Activated Rac1/Cdc42, IQGAP1, and CLIP-170 form a tripartite complex. Furthermore, expression of an IQGAP1 mutant defective in Rac1/Cdc42 binding induces multiple leading edges. These results indicate that Rac1/Cdc42 marks special cortical spots where the IQGAP1 and CLIP-170 complex is targeted, leading to a polarized microtubule array and cell polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2084677920,"Surface adhesion of bacteria generally occurs in the presence of shear stress, and the lifetime of receptor bonds is expected to be shortened in the presence of external force. However, by using Escherichia coli expressing the lectin-like adhesin FimH and guinea pig erythrocytes in flow chamber experiments, we show that bacterial attachment to target cells switches from loose to firm upon a 10-fold increase in shear stress applied. Steered molecular dynamics simulations of tertiary structure of the FimH receptor binding domain and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that shear-enhancement of the FimH-receptor interactions involves extension of the interdomain linker chain under mechanical force. The ability of FimH to function as a force sensor provides a molecular mechanism for discrimination between surface-exposed and soluble receptor molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2139122866,"Double-stranded (ds) RNA induces potent gene silencing, termed RNA interference (RNAi). At an early step in RNAi, an RNaseIII-related enzyme, Dicer (DCR-1), processes long-trigger dsRNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). DCR-1 is also required for processing endogenous regulatory RNAs called miRNAs, but how DCR-1 recognizes its endogenous and foreign substrates is not yet understood. Here we show that the C. elegans RNAi pathway gene, rde-4, encodes a dsRNA binding protein that interacts during RNAi with RNA identical to the trigger dsRNA. RDE-4 protein also interacts in vivo with DCR-1, RDE-1, and a conserved DExH-box helicase. Our findings suggest a model in which RDE-4 and RDE-1 function together to detect and retain foreign dsRNA and to present this dsRNA to DCR-1 for processing."
https://openalex.org/W2022204362,"How membrane receptors initiate signal transduction upon ligand binding is a matter of intense scrutiny. The T cell receptor complex (TCR-CD3) is composed of TCR alpha/beta ligand binding subunits bound to the CD3 subunits responsible for signal transduction. Although it has long been speculated that TCR-CD3 may undergo a conformational change, confirmation is still lacking. We present strong evidence that ligand engagement of TCR-CD3 induces a conformational change that exposes a proline-rich sequence in CD3 epsilon and results in recruitment of the adaptor protein Nck. This occurs earlier than and independently of tyrosine kinase activation. Finally, by interfering with Nck-CD3 epsilon association in vivo, we demonstrate that TCR-CD3 recruitment of Nck is critical for maturation of the immune synapse and for T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2102618729,"Amplification of large genomic regions associated with complex translocations (complicons) is a basis for tumor progression and drug resistance. We show that pro-B lymphomas in mice deficient for both p53 and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) contain complicons that coamplify c-myc (chromosome 15) and IgH (chromosome 12) sequences. While all carry a translocated (12;15) chromosome, coamplified sequences are located within a separate complicon that often involves a third chromosome. Complicon formation is initiated by recombination of RAG1/2-catalyzed IgH locus double-strand breaks with sequences downstream of c-myc, generating a dicentric (15;12) chromosome as an amplification intermediate. This recombination event employs a microhomology-based end-joining repair pathway, as opposed to classic NHEJ or homologous recombination. These findings suggest a general model for oncogenic complicon formation."
https://openalex.org/W2061093792,"Members of the semaphorin family of secreted and transmembrane proteins utilize plexins as neuronal receptors to signal repulsive axon guidance. It remains unknown how plexin proteins are directly linked to the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. Here, we show that Drosophila MICAL, a large, multidomain, cytosolic protein expressed in axons, interacts with the neuronal plexin A (PlexA) receptor and is required for Semaphorin 1a (Sema-1a)-PlexA-mediated repulsive axon guidance. In addition to containing several domains known to interact with cytoskeletal components, MICAL has a flavoprotein monooxygenase domain, the integrity of which is required for Sema-1a-PlexA repulsive axon guidance. Vertebrate orthologs of Drosophila MICAL are neuronally expressed and also interact with vertebrate plexins, and monooxygenase inhibitors abrogate semaphorin-mediated axonal repulsion. These results suggest a novel role for oxidoreductases in repulsive neuronal guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2046976278,"Protein kinase B (Akt) plays a central role in cellular regulation, although many of the physiologically relevant substrates for the kinase remain to be identified. In this study, we have isolated a protein from primary epididymal adipocytes with an apparent molecular weight of 125,000. This protein exhibited immunoreactivity, in an insulin-dependent manner, with a phosphospecific antibody raised against the protein kinase B substrate consensus sequence RXRXX(pS/pT) as well as a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes serine 21/9 of GSK-3α/β. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed the protein to be ATP-citrate lyase, suggesting that the two phosphospecific antibodies recognize phosphoserine 454, a previously reported insulin- and isoproterenol-stimulated ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylation site. Indeed, both insulin and isoproterenol stimulated the phosphorylation of this protein on the site recognized by the phosphospecific antibodies in a wortmannin-sensitive and -insensitive manner, respectively. In addition, transient expression of a constitutively active protein kinase B in primary adipocytes mimicked the effect of insulin on ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylation. Furthermore, ATP-citrate lyase was phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant protein kinase B on the same site. Taken together, these results demonstrate that serine 454 of ATP-citrate lyase is a novel and majorin vivo substrate for protein kinase B.

PKB was subsequently found to be activated by a variety of stimuli such as insulin, growth factors, G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, and integrin binding and to function downstream of phosphoinositide 3-OH-kinase (PI3K) (reviewed in Refs. 4Coffer P.J.

This includes suppression of apoptosis, at least in part through its ability to phosphorylate the pro-apoptotic protein BAD (6Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H.A. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

PKB is also involved in the stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin in muscle and adipose tissues. Transgenic mice that lack PKBβ, the isoform of PKB that predominates in adipose tissue, have markedly impaired glucose tolerance and are insulin-resistant and diabetic (12Cho H., Mu, J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). PKB has been implicated in mediating insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, at least in part through stimulating the translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the plasma membrane (13Cong L.N.

PKB also plays an important role in the stimulation of glycogen synthase by insulin via the phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3α and GSK-3β (16Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar)). In many cases, for example GLUT4 translocation, the substrates of PKB that subsequently mediate the response have not been discovered. To identify potentially novel PKB targets in adipocytes, we have utilized a proteomic approach using a commercially available antibody raised against the minimal PKB consensus phosphorylation site found on almost all of its known substrates, RXRXX(pS/pT) (17Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar,18Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A.

In the process of our study, we identified ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) as a novel PKB substrate in primary rat adipocytes. Except where otherwise stated, all chemicals were from BDH (Lutterworth, Leicester, UK), and biochemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. (Poole, Dorset, UK). Adenosine 5′-[32P]trisphosphate was from ICN Radiochemicals (Basingstoke, UK). Plasmids containing wild-type PKB (HA-PKB), constitutively active myristoylated PKB (Myr-PKB), and constitutively active p110 subunit of PI3K (p110.CAAX) were kindly provided by Dr. D. Alessi (University of Dundee), Dr. B. Hemmings (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel), and Dr. J. Downward (Cancer Research UK, London), respectively. All the PKB sequences included an N-terminal HA tag and were subcloned into the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for expression in rat adipocytes. Anti-ACL antisera, raised in either rabbit or chicken, were provided by Prof. R. M. Denton (University of Bristol). Male Wistar rats (150–200 g) were fed ad libitumon a stock laboratory diet (B&K Universal Ltd., Hull, UK). Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of Wistar rats as described previously (19Diggle T.A. Moule S.K. Avison M.B. Flynn A. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cells were subsequently washed in Krebs-bicarbonate-HEPES buffer, pH 7.4 (130 mmNaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mmNaH2PO4, 15.5 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, and 11 mmglucose) without bovine serum albumin. The cells were pre-treated with 100 nm wortmannin or 10 μm U0126 (Promega, Southampton, UK) for 30 min as indicated in the figure legends and subsequently incubated with 83 nm insulin or 10 nm isoproterenol for 10 min as required. The reaction was terminated by extracting the cells 1:1 (packed cell volume/volume) in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μmmicrocystin, 7.2 mm mercaptoethanol, 5 mmorthovanadate, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain). Alternatively, the cells were extracted (1:1, v/v) in ice-cold TES extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 100 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, antipain, and leupeptin) for subsequent protein sub-fractionation studies. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C, and the infranatant was taken for subsequent analysis. Cells were prepared as described previously (19Diggle T.A. Moule S.K. Avison M.B. Flynn A. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and washed in intracellular Krebs buffer (4 mm NaCl ,125 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmNaH2PO4, 15.5 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, and 11 mmglucose). A 0.4-cm electrode gap Gene Pulser cuvette (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) was used to electroporate 500 μl of cells (30% cytocrit) in the presence of 5 μg of plasmid DNA. Electroporation was performed by administering six shocks at 600 V and a capacitance of 25 microfarads using a Gene Pulser Transfection apparatus (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, cells were transferred to a 30-ml Universal tube (Bibby-Sterilin Ltd., Staffs, UK) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before replacing the medium with 4 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, pH 7.4 (containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm glutamine, 200 nm phenylisopropyladenosine, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, and 25 mm HEPES). The cells were incubated for another 5.5 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2and subsequently washed into Krebs-bicarbonate-HEPES buffer without bovine serum albumin prior to the experiment. Cell extracts prepared as described above were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min and filtered using a 0.22-μm syringe-driven filtration unit to remove fat particles and loaded onto an AmershamBiosciences SMART system Mono-Q column PC 1.6/5 previously equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, antipain, and leupeptin). A linear gradient of buffer A containing 1m NaCl was developed over 2.5 ml at a flow rate of 50 μl/min, and 200-μl fractions were collected. Following Western blotting with the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody, Mono-Q fractions that contained the Mr 125,000 candidate PKB substrate band were pooled and applied to the SMART system Mono-S column PC 1.6/5, previously equilibrated in buffer A. Samples were fractionated against a linear gradient of buffer A containing 1 m NaCl developed over 2.5 ml at a flow rate of 100 μl/min, and 200-μl fractions were collected. Elution of theMr 125,000 protein was determined by Western blotting, and its apparent purity was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining. The Mr 125,000 band was excised from the gel and digested using sequencing grade porcine-modified trypsin (Promega). The peptides produced were analyzed by MALDI-TOF using a PE Biosystems Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. The matrix used was made from 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (recrystallized) in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile (Rathburn, Peebleshire, UK) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The spectrum was acquired over a range of 800–3500 Da, under linear conditions with an accelerating voltage of 2000 V and an extraction delay time of 125 ns. Samples were calibrated using trypsin autolysis products as internal standards. MALDI-TOF data was searched against the NCBInr data base using the ProFound website (20Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). ACL was immunoprecipitated by incubating 2.5 μg (dry weight) of protein A-Sepharose beads and 5 μl of rabbit anti-ACL antiserum with 200 μl of cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in extraction buffer and once in PKB assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA) and subsequently used for in vitro phosphorylation. Alternatively, cell lysates (400 μl) were pre-cleared by centrifugation at 70,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with 10 μl of chicken anti-ACL antiserum for 2 h at 4 °C. The immuno-complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 70,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels prior to transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blots using the anti-PKBsubstrate and phospho-GSK-3 antibodies (both fromCell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The chicken anti-ACL antiserum was used at a 1:1000 dilution. In all cases, immunoreactive bands were visualized with the use of a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit or anti-chicken secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) as appropriate at a dilution of 1:10,000 followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit anti-ACL immunoprecipitates were incubated for 30 min with 780 milliunits of recombinant PKB (a gift from Dr. Dario Alessi, University of Dundee, UK) in the presence of 50 μm ATP (40 kBq/mmol) and 5 mmMgCl2, made up to 25 μl with PKB assay buffer. Reactions were stopped after 30 min by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, prior to separation by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography or Western blotting with the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody. Freshly isolated primary adipocytes derived from rat epididymal fat pads were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin and lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with a phosphospecific antibody (anti-PKBsubstrate) raised against the consensus sequence found in almost all known PKB substrates RXRXX(pS/pT). As shown in Fig.1A, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of many proteins, including those of apparentMr 217,000, 181,000, 125,000, 107,000, 95,000, 78,000, 75,000, 52,000, 51,000, and 48,000 (indicated as bands 1–10, respectively, in Fig. 1A). Pre-treatment of the cells in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin blocked the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of many of these phosphoproteins (Fig. 1A), suggesting that they are regulated by one or more mechanisms downstream of PI3K. Interestingly, the pattern of phosphorylation observed using the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody was very similar to the pattern of 32P-labeled phosphoproteins observed after insulin stimulation of primary rat adipocytes metabolically labeled with [32P]Pi (21Brownsey R.W. Edgell N.J. Hopkirk T.J. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Belsham G.J. Brownsey R.W. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This suggests that this antibody recognizes the majority of the most abundant insulin-stimulated phosphoproteins in rat fat cells. We next incubated primary adipocytes in the presence of wortmannin or U0126 (which inhibits MAPK activation), followed by continued incubation in the absence or presence of insulin for 10 min. Subsequently, the cell lysates were subjected to Mono-Q anion exchange chromatography by SMART fast-protein liquid chromatography, and the resultant fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody (Fig. 1B). Of particular interest was an abundant protein withMr 125,000, which eluted from the Mono-Q column at low salt concentrations in fractions 2–4 (0–120 mmNaCl). The reactivity of the Mr 125,000 protein with the anti- PKBsubstrate antibody was low under basal conditions and increased significantly after insulin treatment in a wortmannin-sensitive but U0126-insensitive manner (Fig. 1B). A further three proteins of apparent Mr 48,000, 51,000, and 52,000, which were also wortmannin-sensitive and U0126-insensitive, eluted later in fractions 4 and 5 (120–200 mm NaCl, Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data indicate that the phosphorylation of the Mr48,000, 51,000 52,000, and 125,000 proteins is regulated in a PI3K-dependent but MAPK-independent manner. Therefore, each of these four proteins represent potential insulin-stimulated PKB substrates. The Mr 125,000 protein was subjected to further purification. To do this we took the peak fraction from the Mono-Q separation for further purification by cation exchange chromatography on a Mono-S column using SMART fast protein liquid chromatography. The resulting fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody, and this revealed that the majority of the Mr 125,000 protein did not bind significantly to the column, being recovered in the column flow-through. 2D. C. Berwick, K. J. Heesom, and J. M. Tavareá, unpublished data.Coomassie Blue staining of the flow-though revealed theMr 125,000 protein to be sufficiently pure to be excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The experimentally determined tryptic peptide masses were then subjected to analysis using ProFound, and the identity of the protein band was confirmed as ATP-citrate lyase (ACL; probability = 1.00 and Z score = 2.37). Western blotting the Mono-S fraction with either of two distinct polyclonal antibodies to ACL verified the identity of the protein.2 Insulin has been previously reported to stimulate the phosphorylation of ACL in a wortmannin-sensitive manner (23Moule S.K. Edgell N.J. Welsh G.I. Diggle T.A. Foulstone E.J. Heesom K.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), although the kinase involved has not been identified. Insulin has also been reported to induce the phosphorylation of a single serine on ACL in rat adipocytes, and this site has been identified as serine 454, which lies in the sequence446TPAPSRTASF455 (24Pierce M.W.

Serine 454 of ACL bears considerable similarity to the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by PKB (RXRXX(pS/pT)Ψ, where Ψ is a bulky hydrophobic residue (17Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 18Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Although the arginine in the −5 position is absent in the serine 454 sequence of ACL, it possesses a phenylalanine at +1, and relatively small amino acids at −1 and −2 (alanine and threonine, respectively). Consistent with the idea that PKB could phosphorylate serine 454, the threonine at the −2 position is reported to be particularly favored by PKB, and alanine is well tolerated (17Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 18Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A.

Concomitant to the induction of ACL serine 454 phosphorylation, insulin reduces the phosphorylation of serine 450 and threonine 446, which lie in the −4 and −8 positions relative to serine 454. These residues are known substrates for phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3 (28Benjamin W.B. Pentyala S.N. Woodgett J.R. Hod Y. Marshak D. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Ramakrishna S. D'Angelo G. Benjamin W.B.

J. 1992; 288: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)). GSK-3 is inhibited via phosphorylation by PKB on serine 21 (GSK-3α) and serine 9 (GSK-3β, reviewed in Ref. 32Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). The sequence surrounding serine 454 of ACL very closely resembles the PKB phosphorylation sites on GSK-3α and GSK-3β (449PSRTASF455versus16RARTSSF22 and4RPRTSSF10, respectively). Interestingly, therefore, we also found that a phosphospecific antibody raised against phosphoserine 21/9 of GSK-3α/β was reactive with ACL by Western blotting and that this reactivity was stimulated by insulin in a wortmannin-sensitive but U0126-insensitive manner (Fig.2A). To confirm that the anti-PKBsubstrate and phospho-GSK-3 antibodies were reacting specifically with ACL, the enzyme was immunoprecipitated with anti-ACL antibodies from primary adipocyte lysates and then Western blotted with phosphospecific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2B, ACL immunoisolated from primary adipocytes was reactive with both the anti-PKBsubstrate and phospho-GSK-3 antibodies, and this reactivity was increased by insulin in a wortmannin-sensitive manner. The β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol is well known to stimulate serine 454 phosphorylation on ACL to high stoichiometry via the activation of PKA (24Pierce M.W. Palmer J.L. Keutmann H.T. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8867-8870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pierce M.W. Palmer J.L. Keutmann H.T. Hall T.A. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10681-10686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, immunoreactivity of ACL toward the anti-PKBsubstrate and anti-phospho-GSK-3 antibodies was increased by isoproterenol to an extent equivalent to that seen with insulin but in a wortmannin-insensitive manner. Taken together the data demonstrate that insulin-stimulated serine 454 phosphorylation on ACL can be detected using either of the anti-PKBsubstrate and phospho-GSK-3 antibodies. Insulin and isoproterenol also stimulated the phosphorylation of GSK-3α and GSK-3β (Fig. 3). As expected the effect of insulin on GSK-3 phosphorylation was almost completely blocked by wortmannin, whereas the effect of isoproterenol was only partially inhibited (Fig.3). It should be noted, however, that the proteins of apparentMr 48,000, 51,000, and 52,000 found in cell lysates, and Mono-Q fractions 4 and 5, using the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody (Fig. 1A) were not GSK-3α or GSK-3β, because they were found to be unreactive with the phospho-GSK-3 antibodies.2 As such these proteins may represent additional potentially novel PKB substrates, and their identities are currently under investigation in our laboratory. Serine 454 of ACL has been demonstrated previously to be phosphorylated by an unknown insulin-activated wortmannin-sensitive kinase and by PKA in vitro (24Pierce M.W. Palmer J.L. Keutmann H.T. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8867-8870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pierce M.W. Palmer J.L. Keutmann H.T. Hall T.A. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10681-10686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yu K.T. Benjamin W.B. Ramakrishna S. Khalaf N. Czech M.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that PKB may be the insulin-activated wortmannin-sensitive cytosolic ACL serine 454 kinase identified by Czech and co-workers (26Yu K.T. Benjamin W.B. Ramakrishna S. Khalaf N. Czech M.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To establish whether PKB is indeed capable of directly phosphorylating ACL in vitro, recombinant active PKB was incubated with immunoprecipitated ACL in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 4, ACL is indeed anin vitro PKB substrate, because 32P incorporation into ACL was significantly increased when it was incubated in the presence of recombinant PKB. The PKB-dependent phosphorylation of ACL was recognized by the anti-PKBsubstrate antibody, suggesting that it was occurring on serine 454 (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that ACL is a direct substrate for phosphorylation by PKB in vitro. We next sought to determine whether active PKB could induce the phosphorylation of ACL in intact cells incubated in the absence of insulin. To do this we transiently transfected primary rat adipocytes by electroporation. This technique results in >80% of the cells becoming successfully transfected. 3S. K. Moule, I. Hers, and R. M. Denton, unpublished data. Primary rat adipocytes were transiently transfected with a constitutively active PKB targeted to the plasma membrane by artificial myristoylation (Myr-PKB) or a constitutively active PI3K catalytic subunit (p110.CAAX). Six hours post transfection, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin, and then ACL phosphorylation was assayed in cell lysates by Western blotting with the PKBsubstrate or phospho-GSK-3 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, both the constitutively active PKB and p110.CAAX stimulated ACL phosphorylation to the same extent as insulin as determined using both the PKBsubstrate and GSK-3 phosphospecific antibodies. The results mirrored the phosphorylation of GSK-3α and GSK-3β, which were increased by the transfected constitutively active Myr-PKB and p110.CAAX, as well as insulin (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results indicate that PKB activation is sufficient for the phosphorylation of ACL in intact adipocytes. In this study we provide evidence to suggest that ATP-citrate lyase is an in vivo substrate for protein kinase B and that this kinase is responsible for the previously reported insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of serine 454. This not only defines ACL as a novel in vivo PKB substrate, but also further characterizes the phosphorylation consensus recognition sequence that can be tolerated by PKB on an intact protein substrate. Evidence to suggest that serine 454 on ACL is a direct substrate for PKB includes the facts that: (i) two distinct phosphospecific antibodies reactive with the PKB consensus sequence cross-react with ACL after insulin stimulation and in a wortmannin-sensitive manner (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3); (ii) extensive peptide mapping experiments have revealed that serine 454 is the only known insulin-stimulated phosphorylation site on ACL (29Ramakrishna S. D'Angelo G. Benjamin W.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7617-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and that it lies in a sequence that overlaps with the epitopes used to raise the PKBsubstrate and phospho-GSK-3 antibodies; (iii) isoproterenol-induced ACL phosphorylation, which occurs on serine 454 via the activation of PKA (24Pierce M.W. Palmer J.L. Keutmann H.T. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8867-8870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pierce M.W. Palmer J.L. Keutmann H.T. Hall T.A. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10681-10686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is also recognized by the PKBsubstrate and phospho-GSK-3 antibodies in a wortmannin-insensitive manner (Fig. 3); (iv) PKB directly phosphorylates ACL in vitro on a site that is recognized by the PKBsubstrate antibody (Fig. 4); and (v) a constitutively active PKB (Myr-PKB) or a constitutively active PI3K (p110.CAAX) that activates PKB in transfected primary adipocytes3 stimulate ACL phosphorylation in the absence of insulin. ACL is a homotetrameric cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the formation of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA from citrate in an ATP-dependent manner and was first identified as a phosphoprotein in 1979 (33Benjamin W.B. Singer I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 351: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34Ramakrishna S. Benjamin W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9232-9236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic acetyl-CoA produced by this enzyme is utilized by acetyl-CoA carboxylase to generate malonyl-CoA, which is then used for the synthesis of fatty acyl CoA by fatty acid synthase. Three phosphorylation sites have been identified on ACL, namely threonine 446, serine 450, and serine 454. Insulin and β-adrenergic receptor agonists induce an increase in serine 454 phosphorylation, the latter agonist acting directly via the activation of PKA. Insulin causes a concomitant decrease in the phosphorylation of the threonine 446 and serine 450 at least in part through the inactivation of GSK-3, although the activation of a phosphatase may also be involved (35Ramakrishna S. Benjamin W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12280-12286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Potapova I.A., El- Maghrabi M.R. Doronin S.V. Benjamin W.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Despite many years of extensive work from several groups, neither isoproterenol or insulin treatment of cells nor in vitro phosphorylation by PKA have any apparent effect on ACL activity (37Ranganathan N.S. Srere P.A. Linn T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 204: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 38Pentyala S.N. Benjamin W.B.

Plenum Press, New York1985: 263-296Google Scholar). 4R. M. Denton, personal communication. Recently, Potapova et al. (36Potapova I.A., El- Maghrabi M.R. Doronin S.V. Benjamin W.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) reported that recombinant ACL purified from Escherichia coli was activated in vitro when serine 454 was phosphorylated by PKA, whereas the phosphorylation of threonine 446 and serine 450 brought about by GSK-3 was without effect. They proposed that the inability to observe changes in the activity of ACL purified from rodent sources was due to extensive phosphorylation during its isolation and subsequent assay; i.e. the bacterially expressed ACL would lack such modifications. However, it is difficult to reconcile a serine 454 phosphorylation-induced activation of ACL by insulin and isoproterenol with their respective stimulatory and inhibitory effects on fatty acid synthesis. As a result, therefore, phosphorylation may also be important in regulating other properties of ACL such as its stability, subcellular localization, and/or interaction with other proteins. Benjamin and co-workers (40Ramakrishna S. Pucci D.L. Benjamin W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) have reported that the phosphorylation of threonine 446 and serine 450 is reduced by insulin but not by isoproterenol in rat adipose tissue. Thus these two hormones may bring about differential effects on ACL function through differences in the relative phosphorylation status of threonine 446, serine 450, and serine 454. In the case of isoproterenol, PKA-induced serine 454 phosphorylation provides the priming phosphoserine required for phosphorylation of threonine 446 and serine 450 by GSK-3 (36Potapova I.A., El- Maghrabi M.R. Doronin S.V. Benjamin W.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 41Ramakrishna S. Pucci D.L. Benjamin W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4950-4956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ramakrishna S. Murthy K.S. Benjamin W.B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the case of insulin, serine 454 phosphorylation would predominate over threonine 446 and serine 450 as a result of GSK-3 inhibition and the activation of a putative threonine 446 and serine 450 phosphatase (35Ramakrishna S. Benjamin W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12280-12286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Potapova I.A., El- Maghrabi M.R. Doronin S.V. Benjamin W.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). PKB-induced serine 454 phosphorylation may prime for threonine 446 and serine 450 re-phosphorylation when the insulin stimulus is removed, and GSK-3 is consequently reactivated. Clearly, considerable and more extensive studies are necessary to examine these possibilities. Our data suggest that the effect of insulin on serine 454 phosphorylation, and perhaps ACL function, is mediated by PKB. Therefore, we propose that insulin receptor activation leads to the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates, recruitment of PI3K, production of plasma membrane phosphoinositide (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, activation of PKB, via PDK1- and “PDK2”-dependent phosphorylation, and finally ACL serine 454 phosphorylation. The other lipogenic steps regulated by insulin are pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which are stimulated via increases in PDH phosphatase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase kinase activity, respectively (43Heesom K.J. Harbeck M. Kahn C.R. Denton R.M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: B3-B9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which insulin regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase is not known, nor has the insulin-stimulated kinase that phosphorylates acetyl-CoA carboxylase been identified. The phosphospecific PKB substrate antibody that we used in this study, which was raised to the PKB consensus sequence RXRXX(pS/pT)Ψ, does not appear to strictly require the arginine in the −5 position for phosphoprotein recognition, because this residue is lacking in ACL. Indeed, the fact that PKB phosphorylates an451RXXS454 motif in ACL is significant. To date we are aware of only one other study that suggests that PKB can phosphorylate a protein substrate that lacks the arginine in the −5 position relative to the phosphorylation site; this being serine 133 of CREB (10Du K.Y. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Interestingly, serine 133 of CREB lies in the sequence 128LSRRPSY134, which, like serine 454 of ACL, is also a target for phosphorylation by PKA (10Du K.Y. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). All other known sequences in protein substrates for PKB appear to conform strictly to the RXRXX(S/T)Ψ motif (44Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,45Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The consensus PKB phosphorylation site, RXRXX(S/T)Ψ, has been derived from a number of studies, including two that utilize synthetic peptide libraries (17Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar,18Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The peptide sequenceARKRERAYSFGHHA was reported to be the optimal short peptide substrate for phosphorylation by recombinant PKB (18Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Substitution of the arginine at −3 relative to the phosphoserine (underlined) obliterated the ability of this peptide to serve as a substrate. In contrast, a peptide with an arginine at −5 substituted for an alanine was still phosphorylated but with a decrease of ∼20-fold in Vmax/Km. Substitution of the alanine at position −2 for a threonine (as would be the case for serine 454 in ACL), which is a more optimal amino acid at this position, might be expected to increase theVmax/Km, although this remains to be proven. It is important to note that, because the PKB substrate consensus sequence has been derived from studies using short peptides, it may not represent the situation for an intact protein substrate in vivo. For this reason caution should be exercised when performing homology searches for PKB substrates based on the RXRXX(S/T)Ψ sequence. Our results raise the possibility that tertiary topology could also be important in making a “sub-optimal” site amenable to phosphorylation by PKB. Furthermore, Alessi and co-workers (44Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently postulated the existence of a PKB docking site on some substrates in a manner analogous to the δ-domain on c-Jun that acts as a JNK docking site. This could make a sub-optimal site for PKB phosphorylation an excellent substratein vivo. It remains to be established if ACL possesses such a PKB docking site, or whether such a site actually exists in any PKB substrate identified to date. In conclusion, our data show that serine 454 on ACL is a novel in vivo substrate for PKB. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use of a phosphospecific antibody to the generalized PKB substrate consensus sequence is a viable proteomic approach for discovering novel PKB substrates. We are grateful to Dick Denton (University of Bristol) for useful discussions. We are also grateful to Dario Alessi (University of Dundee), Brian Hemmings (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel), and Julian Downward (Cancer Research UK, London) for the kind gifts of recombinant purified PKB, Myr-PKB, and p110.CAAX, respectively, and to Virginia Shaw (University of Bristol) for assistance with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry."

Most of the studies were carried out with l-amino acid peptides possessing amphipathic α-helix or β-sheet structures, which are known to be important for biological activities. Here we compared the effect of significantly altering the sequence of an amphipathic α-helical peptide (15 amino acids long) and its diastereomer (composed of both l- and d-amino acids) regarding their structure, function, and interaction with model membranes and intact bacteria. Interestingly, the effect of sequence alteration on biological function was similar for thel-amino acid peptides and the diastereomers, despite some differences in their structure in the membrane as revealed by attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. However, whereas the all l-amino acid peptides were highly hemolytic, had low solubility, lost their activity in serum, and were fully cleaved by trypsin and proteinase K, the diastereomers were nonhemolytic and maintained full activity in serum. Furthermore, sequence alteration allowed making the diastereomers either fully, partially, or totally protected from degradation by the enzymes. Transmembrane potential depolarization experiments in model membranes and intact bacteria indicate that although the killing mechanism of the diastereomers is via membrane perturbation, it is also dependent on their ability to diffuse into the inner bacterial membrane. These data demonstrate the advantage of the diastereomers over their alll-amino acid counterparts as candidates for developing a repertoire of new target antibiotics with a potential for systemic use.

The search for antibiotics with a new mode of action has increased the interest in antibacterial peptides as potential therapeutic agents.

The coexistence of l- and d-amino acids causes the formation of unique structures and properties completely different from all l-amino acid peptides. Unfortunately, these peptide antibiotics are not cell-selective and are highly toxic to normal eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, their activity is significantly altered by the modification of sequences. Previous studies revealed that the incorporation of d-amino acids into native and model non-cell-selective lytic peptides with either α-helix or β-sheet structures resulted in a loss of their cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells, but they retained their antibacterial properties (25Shai Y.

In this study we significantly altered the sequence of an α-helical lytic peptide (15 amino acids long) and its diastereomers. The peptides are composed of leucine and lysine, whereas one-third of the sequence of the diastereomers consists ofd-amino acids. Peptide length and the position ofd-amino acids were such that short consecutive stretches of 1–3 l-amino acids that cannot form an α-helical structure were constructed. Three peptides were designed to fold into an ideal amphipathic α-helix in their all l-amino acid form (i.e. the hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids are localized in opposite faces of the helix) but with a different distribution of the d-amino acids along the hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces; one had a scrambled sequence of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids, and in two peptides we grouped the hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids (termed segregated peptides). The diastereomers and their representative all l-amino acid parental peptides were evaluated with regard to their cytotoxicity against bacteria and human erythrocytes, their structure in phospholipid membranes, their ability to depolarize the transmembrane potential of bacteria and model phospholipid vesicles, their ability to oligomerize in solution and in membranes, and their stability regarding enzymatic degradation. We discuss the results with respect to the mode of action of diastereomeric peptides and their advantage over their alll-amino acid counterparts for future therapeutic use. 4-Methyl benzhydrylamine resin and butyloxycarbonyl amino acids were purchased from Calibochem-Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA). Other reagents used for peptide synthesis included trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Aldrich), methylene chloride (peptide synthesis grade, Biolab, IL), dimethylformamide (peptide synthesis grade, Biolab, IL), piperidine (Merck), and benzotriazolyl-n-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium-hexafluorophosphate (Sigma). Trypsin, proteinase K, egg phosphatidylcholine (PC),1 egg phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Type V, fromE. coli), sphingomyelin (SM), and cholesterol were purchased from Sigma. 3,3′-Diethylthio-dicarbocyanine iodide (diS-C3-5) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All of the other reagents were of analytical grade. The buffers were prepared in double glass-distilled water. The peptides were synthesized by a solid phase method on 4-methyl benzhydrylamine resin (0.05 meq) (27Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Labeling of the N terminus of the peptides with rhodamine was done on the resin-bound peptide as described previously (18Pouny Y. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9482-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The resin-bound peptides were cleaved from the resins by hydrogen fluoride and, after hydrogen fluoride evaporation and washing with dry ether, extracted with 50% acetonitrile/water. Hydrogen fluoride cleavage of the peptides bound to 4-methyl benzhydrylamine resin resulted in C-terminally amidated peptides. Each crude peptide contained one major peak, as revealed by RP-HPLC that was 50–70% pure by weight. The peptides were further purified by RP-HPLC on a C18 reverse phase Bio-Rad semi-preparative column (250 × 10 mm, 300-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size). The column was eluted in 40 min using a linear gradient of 10–60% acetonitrile in water, both containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v), at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min. The purified peptides were shown to be homogeneous (>98%) by analytical HPLC. The peptides were further subjected to amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectroscopy to confirm their composition and molecular weight. SUVs were prepared by sonication of PC/SM/cholesterol (5:5:1 w/w) or PE/PG (7:3 w/w) dispersions as described previously (17Gazit E. Lee W.J. Brey P.T. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10681-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). LUVs were prepared by extrusion from the same lipids as described in detail previously (28Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13496-13505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The vesicles were visualized using a JEOL JEM 100B electron microscope (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Tokyo, Japan) as follows. A drop of the vesicles was deposited on a carbon-coated grid and negatively stained with uranyl acetate. Examination of the grids showed that the vesicles were unilamellar with an average diameter of 20–50 nm with SUV and 100 nm with LUV. The antibacterial activity of the peptides was examined in sterile 96-well plates (Nunc F96 microtiter plates) in a final volume of 100 μl as follows. Aliquots (50 μl) of a suspension containing bacteria (mid-log phase) at a concentration of 106colony-forming units/ml in culture medium (LB medium) were added to 50 μl of water containing the peptide in serial 2-fold dilutions in water. Inhibition of growth was determined by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm with a Microplate autoreader El309 (Bio-tek Instruments) after an incubation of 18–20 h at 37 °C. The antibacterial activities were expressed as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), the concentration at which 100% inhibition of growth was observed after 18–20 h of incubation. The bacteria used wereEscherichia coli D21, E. coli ATCC 25922,Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Micrococcus luteus,Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 5185, as well as two clinical isolates, Staphylococcus simulans 22 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis LT1324. Fresh hRBCs were rinsed three times with PBS (35 mmphosphate buffer, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.3) by centrifugation for 10 min at 800 × g and resuspended in PBS. The peptides dissolved in PBS were then added to 50 μl of the stock hRBC solution in PBS to make a final volume of 100 μl (final erythrocyte concentration, 4% v/v). The resulting suspension was incubated with agitation for 60 min at 37 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min. By measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 540 nm, we monitored the release of hemoglobin. Controls for zero hemolysis (blank) and 100% hemolysis consisted of hRBCs suspended in PBS and 1% Triton X-100, respectively. Membrane destabilization, which results in the collapse of the diffusion potential, was detected fluorimetrically as described previously (29Sims P.J. Waggoner A.S. Wang C.H. Hoffmann J.R. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3315-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 30Loew L.M. Rosenberg I. Bridge M. Gitler C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Shai Y. Bach D. Yanovsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20202-20209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a LUV suspension prepared in K+ buffer (50 mm K2SO4, 25 mm HEPES-sulfate, pH 6.8) was added to an isotonic K+-free buffer (50 mmNa2SO4, 25 mm of HEPES-sulfate, pH 6.8), and the dye diS-C3-5 was then added. The subsequent addition of valinomycin created a negative diffusion potential inside the vesicles by the selective efflux of K+ ions, which resulted in quenching of the dye fluorescence (ΔΨ = −142 mV). Peptide-induced membrane permeation for all of the ions in the solution caused a dissipation of the diffusion potential, manifested by an increase in fluorescence. The fluorescence was monitored using excitation and emission wavelengths at 620 and 670 nm, respectively. The percentage of fluorescence recovery (Ft) was defined by the following equation,Ft=[(It−Io)/(If−Io)]100%Equation 1 where It is the fluorescence observed after the addition of a peptide at time t,Io is the fluorescence after the addition of valinomycin, and If is the total fluorescence before adding valinomycin. The assay was done with Gram-negative bacterial spheroplasts and Gram-positive bacteria, using the experimental conditions described previously (32Wu M. Maier E. Benz R. Hancock R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7235-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). S. aureus was grown at 37 °C with agitation to mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.4). The cells were centrifuged and washed once with buffer (20 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and resuspended to a OD600 of 0.05 in a similar buffer containing 0.1m KCl. The cells (the same concentration as in the biological activity assay) were incubated with 1 μmdiS-C3-5 until a stable reduction of fluorescence was achieved (around 60 min), indicating the incorporation of the dye into the bacterial membrane. The peptides were then added from the stock solution (1 mg/ml) and dissolved in the KCl buffer to achieve the desired concentration (0.1–10-fold the MIC concentration). Membrane depolarization was monitored by observing the change in the intensity of fluorescence emission of the membrane potential-sensitive dye diS-C3-5 (excitation wavelength λex = 622 nm, emission wavelength λem = 670 nm) after the addition of different concentrations of peptides. Spheroplasts of E. coli(D21 and ATCC 25922 strains) (lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycane free bacteria (33Yanagida N. Uozumi T. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 937-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) were prepared by osmotic shock procedure as follows. First, the cells from cultures grown to OD600 = 0.8 were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with 10 mm Tris/H2SO4, 25% sucrose, pH 7.5. Next, the cells were resuspended in the washing buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. After a 10-min incubation at 20 °C with rotary mixing, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended immediately in freezing (0 °C) water. After a 10-min incubation at 4 °C with rotary mixing, the spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation. The spheroplasts were then resuspended to OD600 of 0.05 in a buffer containing 20 mmglucose, 5 mm HEPES, 1 m KCl, pH 7.3. Further treatment was done exactly as described for S. aureus. The spectra were obtained with a Bruker equinox 55 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a deuterated triglyceride sulfate detector and coupled to an ATR device as described previously (34Oren Z. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6103-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture of PE/PG (0.5 mg) alone or with peptide (∼20 μg) was deposited on a ZnSe horizontal ATR prism (80 × 7 mm). The aperture angle of 45° yielded 25 internal reflections. Prior to sample preparations, the trifluoroacetate (CF3COO−) counterions, which strongly associate with the peptides, were replaced with chloride ions through several lyophilizations of the peptides in 0.1 m HCl to eliminate an absorption band near 1673 cm−1 (35Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Lipid-peptide mixtures were prepared by dissolving them together in a 1:2 MeOH/CH2Cl2 mixture and drying under a stream of dry nitrogen while moving a Teflon bar back and forth along the ZnSe prism. The spectra were recorded, and the respective pure phospholipid spectra were subtracted to yield the difference spectra. The background for each spectrum was a clean ZnSe prism. Hydration of the sample was achieved by introducing excess deuterium oxide (2H2O) into a chamber placed on top of the ZnSe prism in the ATR casting and incubating for 2 h before acquisition of the spectra. The H/D (proton to deuterium) exchange was considered complete after total shift of the amide II band. Any contribution of 2H2O vapor to the absorbance spectra near the amide I peak region was eliminated by subtracting the spectra of pure lipids equilibrated with 2H2O under the same conditions. Prior to curve fitting, a straight base line passing through the ordinates at 1700 and 1600 cm−1 was subtracted. To resolve overlapping bands, the spectra were processed using PEAKFITTM (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) software. Second-derivative spectra accompanied by 13-data point Savitsky-Golay smoothing were calculated to identify the positions of the component bands in the spectra. These wave numbers were used as initial parameters for curve fitting with Gaussian component peaks. Position, bandwidths, and amplitudes of the peaks were varied until (i) the resulting bands shifted by no more than 2 cm−1 from the initial parameters, (ii) all of the peaks had reasonable half-widths (< 20–25 cm−1), and (iii) good agreement between the calculated sum of all of the components and the experimental spectra was achieved (r2 > 0.99). The relative contents of different secondary structure elements were estimated by dividing the areas of individual peaks assigned to a specific secondary structure by the whole area of the resulting amide I band. The results of four independent experiments were averaged. The CD spectra of the peptides were measured with a Jasco J-500A spectropolarimeter after calibrating the instrument with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. The spectra were scanned at 25 °C in a capped, quartz optical cell with a 0.5 mm path length. The spectra were obtained at wavelengths of 250–190 nm. Eight scans were taken for each peptide at a scan rate of 20 nm/min. The peptides were scanned at 50 μm in the presence of 1% SDS. Fractional helicities (36Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar, 37Wu C.S. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) were calculated as follows,[θ]222−[θ]2220[θ]222100−[θ]2220Equation 2 where [θ]222 is the experimentally observed mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm, and the values for [θ]2220 and [θ]222100, which correspond to 0 and 100% helix content at 222 nm, are estimated to be 2000 and 32000 deg·cm2/dmol, respectively (37Wu C.S. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Trypsin or proteinase K (10 μg/ml in PBS) was added to a solution of the peptides in PBS (1 μm), and the reaction was monitored by using RP-HPLC and electrospray mass spectroscopy. We used RP-HPLC with a C18 reverse phase Bio-Rad analytical column (250 × 4 mm, 300-Å pore size, 7-μm particle size). The column was eluted in 40 min, using a linear gradient of 10–60% acetonitrile in water both containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The electrospray mass spectroscopy was performed to confirm the composition and molecular weight of the product. Rhodamine-labeled peptide (final concentration, 2 μm) was added to 100 μl of PBS, PC/SM/cholesterol (5:5:1 w/w), and PE/PG (7:3 w/w) SUVs, and rhodamine fluorescence emission was tracked. Lipid concentration was kept high (100 μm) such that most of the peptide was bound to the vesicles. Trypsin or proteinase K (10 μg/ml in PBS) was then added, and the resulting fluorescence was monitored. An increase in fluorescence indicates that the peptide exists as an oligomer. Excitation was set at 530 nm (8-nm slit) and emission was set at 582 nm (4-nm slit). All of the fluorescence measurements were performed at room temperature on an SLM-Aminco Series 2 Spectrofluorimeter. The samples containing E. coli D21 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (1 × 106 colony-forming units/ml) in LB medium were incubated with the peptides at their MIC and 60% of the MIC for 1 h and then centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × g. The pellets were resuspended, and a drop containing the bacteria was deposited onto a carbon-coated grid and negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid, pH 6.8. The grids were examined using a JEOL JEM 100B electron microscope (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Tokyo, Japan). The data presented in the following sections revealed that the alll-amino acid parental peptides are highly hemolytic, are fully cleaved by enzymes, and lose their activity in serum and that some have low solubility in water. In contrast, all of the diastereomers are nonhemolytic, their sensitivity to enzymatic degradation can be controlled, they are highly soluble in water, and they maintain full activity in serum. Therefore, beside determination of structure, which was done for both the all l-amino acid peptides and the diastereomers, all of the other biophysical studies were carried out only with the diastereomers. The six diastereomers of a lytic peptide and three representatives of the all l-amino acid counterparts were composed of lysine and leucine. All of the peptides were amidated at their C termini and had a net +7 charge. The amino acid sequences of the peptides, as well as their designations and retention times are shown in Table I. Fig.1 shows a Schiffer-Edmundson (38Schiffer M. Edmundson A.B. Biophys. J. 1967; 7: 121-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) wheel structure of the amphipathic all l-amino acid peptide, Amphipathic-1L (Fig. 1A), as well as those of the corresponding amphipathic diastereomers to visualize the distribution of the d-amino acids (Fig. 1, B–D). The amphipathic diastereomers also have a markedly α-helical/distorted helical structure (to be discussed later). d-Amino acids were located in all of the peptides at positions 3, 6, 8, 9, and 13, which are likely to disrupt the formation of a helical structure. Among the diastereomers, the distribution of the d-amino acids along the hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces is different (Fig. 1, B–D). Other peptides include a scrambled all l-amino acid peptide and its diastereomer, as well as one all l-amino acid peptide and its two diastereomers, in which the hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids were grouped (segregated peptides).Table IDesignations, sequences, retention times, and percentages of enzymatic degradation of the peptides investigatedPeptide designationSequence1-aUnderlined and bold amino acids are d-enantiomers.

Interestingly, the trend in antimicrobial activity was similar for the alll-amino acid peptides and their corresponding diastereomers. In addition, the amphipathic diastereomers, 1D, 2D, and 3D, had a similar high antimicrobial activity against all bacteria tested, despite a different distribution of thed-amino acids along the amphipathic face (Fig. 1,B–D). Furthermore, even scrambling the sequence did not significantly change the activity of the resulting analogs. In addition, segregating the hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids also preserved activity but only toward selected bacteria (Table II).Table IIMinimal inhibitory concentrations of the peptides and their hemolytic activityPeptide designationE. coli ATCC 25922E. coliD21MRSE LT13242-aMRSE, methicillin-resistantS. epidermidis.P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853A. baumannii ATCC 19606M. luteusS. simulansS. aureus II ATCC 6538PHemolysis at 100 μmμmμmμmμmμmμmμmμm%l-Amino acid peptides Amphipathic-1L13134251223100 Scrambled-4L331.56221.5682 Segregated-5L505032>505016325066Diastereomers Amphipathic-1D7413130.51130 Amphipathic-2D2260.56110.51250 Amphipathic-3D11513100.51450 Scrambled-4D6316150.41250 Segregated-5D4414150500.31>503 Segregated-6D>56718500.51>5002-a MRSE, methicillin-resistantS. epidermidis.

https://openalex.org/W2026700392,"Transmembrane proteins of the tetraspanin superfamily are assembled in multimeric complexes on the cell surface. Spatial orientation of tetraspanins within these complexes may affect signaling functions of the associated transmembrane receptors (e.g. integrins, receptor-type tyrosine kinases). The structural determinants that control assembly of the tetraspanin complexes are unknown. We have found that various tetraspanins and the α3 integrin subunit are palmitoylated. The stability and molecular composition of the palmitoylated α3β1-tetraspanin complexes are not affected by adhesion. To assess the significance of palmitoylation in the function of the α3β1-tetraspanin complexes we mapped the sites of palmitoylation for CD151. Mutation of six cysteines, Cys11, Cys15, Cys79, Cys80, Cys242, and Cys243 was necessary to completely abolish palmitoylation of CD151. The association of the palmitoylation-deficient mutant of CD151 (CD151Cys8) with CD81 and CD63 was markedly decreased, but the interaction of the α3β1-CD151Cys8 complex with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase was not affected. Ectopic expression of CD151Cys8 in Rat-1 cells impaired the interactions of the endogenous CD63 and CD81 with the α3β1 integrin. Although the expression of the palmitoylation-deficient CD151 does not change cell spreading on the extracellular matrix, the number of focal adhesions increased. Adhesion-induced phosphorylation of PKB/c-Akt is markedly increased in cells expressing a palmitoylation-deficient mutant, thereby providing direct evidence for the role of the tetraspanin microdomains in regulation of the integrin-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. In contrast, activation of FAK and ERK1/2 were not affected by the expression of CD151Cys8. Our results demonstrate that palmitoylation of tetraspanins is critical not only for the organization of the integrin-tetraspanin microdomains but also has a specific role in modulation of adhesion-dependent signaling.

Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical function of tetraspanins remains unclear, recent gene knock-out experiments and numerous in vitro data strongly indicate that tetraspanins play an important role in generating immune responses, membrane dynamics and fusion, cell migration, and invasion (2Shearer M.

Murabayashi N. Fukui A. Tsuji S. Matsumoto M. Toyoshima K. Seya T. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that within these microdomains tetraspanins may regulate spatial orientation and lateral interactions of the receptors thereby affecting their biological activities (3Kurita-Taniguchi M. Hazeki K. Murabayashi N. Fukui A. Tsuji S. Matsumoto M. Toyoshima K. Seya T. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Delaguillaumie A. Lagaudriere-Gesbert C.

The molecular mechanisms that govern the recruitment of tetraspanins into TERM and hierarchy of their interactions within these microdomains are not well established. It has been proposed that although each of the tetraspanin components of TERM has a specific proximal non-tetraspanin partner, no preferential partnerships are formed between the tetraspanins themselves (2Shearer M. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Berdichevsky F. Barnes D. Millis R. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, the receptor cross-communication within TERM may be controlled by a variety of tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions.Recent reports have established that while the association with a non-tetraspanin partner is controlled by the large extracellular loop of tetraspanins (5Yauch R.L.

The association between the tetraspanins occurs at the later stages during the protein biosynthesis (presumably, in Golgi or post-Golgi compartments (7Berditchevski F. Gilbert E. Griffiths M.R.

This suggests the following possibilities: (i) the interaction requires a post-translational modification of the proteins (e.g.glycosylation, lipidation); (ii) there may be sorting mechanisms that compartmentalize tetraspanins in proximity to one another thereby allowing the interaction to occur. Although glycosylation may play an important role in association of tetraspanins with non-tetraspanin partners and their biological activities (8Ono M. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it is unlikely to contribute significantly to the tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions. First, the sequence analysis predicts that in most tetraspanins sites of glycosylation are located within the large extracellular loop. Second, CD81, a tetraspanin that does not have consensus glycosylation motifs, is readily incorporated into TERM (9Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).Protein lipidation (prenylation, myristoylation, and palmitoylation) is one of the most common covalent modifications of cellular proteins (10Resh M.D. Cell.

It has been shown that acylation may influence protein stability, subcellular localization, and can play an important role in overall re-distribution of proteins at the plasma membrane (12Blanpain C. Wittamer V. Vanderwinden J.M. Boom A. Renneboog B. Lee B., Le Poul E., El Asmar L. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 1631-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In turn, this compartmentalization of acylated proteins into microdomains can facilitate protein-protein interactions and affect their biological functions (11Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 15Lee H. Woodman S.E. Engelman J.A. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Kaufman H.L. Lublin D.M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35150-35158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Earlier studies have shown that tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 are linked to saturated acyl chains (16Seehafer J.G. Slupsky J.R. Tang S.C. Masellis-Smith A. Shaw A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1039: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17Seehafer J.G. Tang S.C. Slupsky J.R. Shaw A.R. Biochim.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14597-14602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given their intrinsic propensity to assemble into tightly packed microdomains (19Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar), saturated acyl chains may stabilize and control spatial orientation of proteins within the tetraspanin complexes. Indeed, recent reports (20Charrin S. Manié S. Qualid M. Billard M. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Yang X. Claas C. Kraeft S.-K. Chen L.B. Wang Z. Kriedberg J.A. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and our present study demonstrate that mutations of the palmitoylation sites in CD9 and CD151 affect the association of the tetraspanins with one another within TERM. Importantly, here we show for the first time that (i) palmitoylation of tetraspanins is crucial for the recruitment of the associated non-tetraspanin partners into TERM, and (ii) palmitoylation-dependent localization of the α3β1 integrin in TERM selectively affects its signaling potential.DISCUSSIONMultiplicity and apparent redundancy of protein-protein interactions involving tetraspanins pose a major problem in assessing the contribution of an individual tetraspanin to a particular biological phenomenon such as cell migration, cell-cell adhesion, and co-stimulatory processes in T- and B-cells. Here we have shown that tetraspanins are palmitoylated and palmitoylation is important for the assembly of the tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. It has to be emphasized that although palmitic chains facilitate co-aggregation of different tetraspanins, their role in establishing and maintaining direct protein-protein contacts within TERM is less apparent. Indeed, treatment of cells with 2-bromopalmitate under the conditions that completely block incorporation of [3H]palmitate into cellular proteins has only a modest effect on the tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions. Thus, we propose a two-step model of the assembly of TERM. First, palmitoylated tetraspanins (each in association with a specific non-tetraspanin partner) are aggregated, possibly as a consequence of preferential coalescence of saturated acyl chains (19Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar, 32Brown D. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Second, direct contacts between tetraspanin polypeptides are established that may lead to subsequent re-organization of the tetraspanin aggregates.Previous biochemical studies suggested that CD151 has a pivotal role in linking the α3β1 integrin to other tetraspanins (5Yauch R.L. Kazarov A.R. Desai B. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9230-9238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7Berditchevski F. Gilbert E. Griffiths M.R. Fitter S. Ashman L.K. Jenner S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41165-41174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Not only does this study provide direct experimental support for this idea, but we also demonstrate that palmitoylation of CD151 is critical for its function in sorting of α3β1. It has been recently proposed that CD36, an unrelated palmitoylated membrane protein, is also implicated in surface compartmentalization of β1 integrins (34Thorne R.F. Marshall J.F. Shafren D.R. Gibson P.G. Hart I.R. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35264-35275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Specifically, it was shown that the ectopic expression of CD36 increases the amounts of β1 integrin (mainly, α3β1 and α6β1) in the Triton X-100-resistant lipid rafts (34Thorne R.F. Marshall J.F. Shafren D.R. Gibson P.G. Hart I.R. Burns G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35264-35275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although additional studies are required to establish the relationship between CD36 and the α3β1-CD151 complex, one possibility is that CD36 controls distribution of β1 integrins between TERM and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. Indeed, although a major portion of the α3β1-tetraspanin complexes are sensitive to extraction with Triton X-100, small amounts can be found in the Triton X-100-insoluble fractions of sucrose gradient (29Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Site-directed mutagenesis has revealed that CD151 can be palmitoylated at multiple sites; simultaneous mutation of six cysteines (Cys11, Cys15, Cys79, Cys80, Cys242, and Cys243) is required to eliminate palmitoylation. Multiple palmitoylation sites were also identified in the tetraspanin CD9 (20Charrin S. Manié S. Qualid M. Billard M. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to CD151 corresponding cysteines within the second transmembrane domain of CD9 do not seem to function as acceptor sites for palmitic acid. Why do tetraspanins need multiple acyl chains attached to their polypeptide backbone? Not only would this make the membrane sorting of tetraspanins more efficient (see above), but multiple palmitates may also stabilize intramolecular interactions between their various domains. For example, tight packing of saturated acyl chains within the inner leaflet of the surface membrane may facilitate the alignment of transmembrane domains of tetraspanins relative to one another. This will lead to juxtaposition of the intracellular portions of tetraspanins, which together could form a binding pocket for other proteins associated with TERM (see also below).When this study was completed Yang et al. (21Yang X. Claas C. Kraeft S.-K. Chen L.B. Wang Z. Kriedberg J.A. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) published a report in which they examined the palmitoylation of CD151. These authors found that mutations of Cys11, Cys15, Cys242, and Cys243 in CD151 decreased the level of palmitoylation of the protein by >90%. Furthermore, it has been shown that these mutations re-direct CD151 from the intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane (21Yang X. Claas C. Kraeft S.-K. Chen L.B. Wang Z. Kriedberg J.A. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These observations are in contrast to our study which shows that (i) when a corresponding cysteine mutant (i.e. CD151Cys2) is expressed in Rat-1 cells the level of palmitoylation is diminished only by 70% (Fig. 6), and (ii) all cysteine mutants of CD151 show comparable intracellular distribution. While observed discrepancies may be due to the cell system used, it is also possible that by placing green fluorescent protein tag to the C-terminal end of CD151 Yang and colleagues have changed some of the properties of the tetraspanin. In this regard it is important to emphasize that the C-terminal cytoplasmic part of CD151 contains a potential tyrosine-based sorting motif ( … Y245RSL … ), accessibility to which by the elements of the intracellular sorting machinery may be affected by the fused sequences.A number of other palmitoylated cellular proteins are co-immunoprecipitated with tetraspanins (Figs. 1 D and5 C). One of these proteins has been identified as the α3 integrin subunit. To our knowledge this is a first report describing palmitoylation of any integrin subunit. Although the functional significance of the integrin palmitoylation remains to be established, our results show that it is dependent on the palmitoylation of CD151; the level of palmitoylation of the integrin in the complex with CD151Cys8 is significantly reduced when compared with the α3β1-CD151wt complex. One possibility is that palmitoylation of α3 is more efficient within the tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. Recent results have shown that palmitoyltransferase activity is compartmentalized on the surface membrane (35Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43300-43304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Alternatively, palmitoylation-deficient CD151 may hinder the accessibility of the α3-transmembrane cysteine for the enzyme. Although the identity of other palmitoylated proteins associated with the α3β1-tetraspanin complex remains unknown, we were able to exclude two of the potential candidates. It has been reported that the α3β1 integrin is associated with caveolin, the principal structural component of caveolae (36Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Although caveolin is palmitoylated in MDA-MB-231 cells, it does not associate with the α3β1-tetraspanin complexes (results are not shown). Furthermore, in these cells we found no evidence for the association of the complexes with palmitoylated Fyn, a tyrosine kinase that is known to be abundant in the cholesterol-rich microdomains (results are not shown). The lack of the association between α3β1-tetraspanin complexes with Fyn and caveolin further supports the idea that palmitoylated tetraspanins are sorted into membrane microdomains with a distinct repertoire of the associated proteins.Recent observations demonstrate that membrane compartmentalization into cholesterol-rich lipid rafts controls activation state and signaling potency of integrins (37Krauss K. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36921-36927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 38Leitinger B. Hogg N. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1800-1805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we found that adhesion-dependent signaling is controlled by compartmentalization of integrins into microdomains, which lay outside of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts; uncoupling of the α3β1-CD151 complex from the endogenous tetraspanins potentiates assembly of focal adhesions and has a positive effect on activation of PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway. These results suggest that signaling heterogeneity of integrins is even more complex than previously thought (i.e.localization into cholesterol-rich lipid rafts → activation of integrins → potentiation of adhesion-dependent signaling) (38Leitinger B. Hogg N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 963-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, our data not only directly links TERM to regulation of a specific signaling pathway(s) triggered by α3β1 but also implies that the association with these microdomains negatively affects its signaling potential.Although in this study we did not specifically examine the link between PI 3-kinase and focal adhesions, several earlier reports placed PI 3-kinase upstream of RhoA GTPase, a protein that is known to play a key role in the assembly of focal adhesions (40Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr.

Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of the adhesion-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase are not fully understood and may involve complementary signals from various small GTPases and tyrosine kinases (43Chan T.O. Rodeck U. Chan A.M. Kimmelman A.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Panayotou G. Tsichlis P.N. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It remains to be established which signaling pathway connects the α1β3-CD151 complex with PI 3-kinase. Earlier studies linked integrin-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase with FAK (44Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar,45Guan J.-L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Specifically, it was found that phosphorylation of FAK on tyrosine 397 induces assembly of the FAK-PI 3-kinase (class I) complex and activation of the lipid kinase. However, our results show that adhesion-induced phosphorylation of Tyr397 of FAK was similar in cells expressing the wild-type and palmitoylation-deficient mutant of CD151. Furthermore, we found that the association of PI 3-kinase (class I) and FAK was comparable in the Rat-1 transfectants (results are not shown). An alternative possibility could involve activation of PI 3-kinase by Src family kinases, which are known to assemble in a multiprotein complex in response to cell adhesion (14Lin R.Z., Hu, Z.W. Chin J.H. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31196-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,33Ojaniemi M. Martin S.S. Dolfi F. Olefsky J.M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3780-3787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although our data show that the expression of CD151Cys8 modifies signaling via c-Src, 2F. Berditchevski, E. Odintsova, S. Sawada, and E. Gilbert, manuscript in preparation. we were unable to detect PI 3-kinase-c-Src complexes in Rat-1 cells. Finally, it was possible that CD151-associated PI 4-kinase contributes to the integrin-induced activation of PKB in Rat-1 cells. PI 4-kinase catalyzes synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, a substrate for PI 3-kinase to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, which, in turn, activates PKB. However, our results show that mutation of palmitoylation sites does not affect the activity of PI 4-kinase associated with the α3β1-CD151 complex.In summary, we have demonstrated that palmitoylation is an important step in the assembly of the tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. Importantly, using a palmitoylation-deficient mutant of CD151, we have provided clear evidence that this tetraspanin has a pivotal role in the compartmentalization of the α3β1 integrin into TERM. Finally, our data indicate that CD151-induced entry into TERM selectively negates certain signaling pathways triggered by α3β1. Not only do these results specifically point to a new mode of regulation of the signaling activity of the integrin but they also suggest a common function for tetraspanins in signaling. Tetraspanins constitute a large family of widely expressed four-transmembrane domain proteins (1Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical function of tetraspanins remains unclear, recent gene knock-out experiments and numerous in vitro data strongly indicate that tetraspanins play an important role in generating immune responses, membrane dynamics and fusion, cell migration, and invasion (2Shearer M. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Berdichevsky F. Barnes D. Millis R. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Kurita-Taniguchi M. Hazeki K.

Conjeaud H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 433-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important biochemical feature of tetraspanins is their ability to aggregate with one another and with various other transmembrane receptors into multimeric clusters often referred as the “tetraspanin web” or tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (or TERM)1 (2Shearer M. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Berdichevsky F. Barnes D. Millis R. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Kurita-Taniguchi M. Hazeki K. Murabayashi N. Fukui A. Tsuji S. Matsumoto M. Toyoshima K. Seya T. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that within these microdomains tetraspanins may regulate spatial orientation and lateral interactions of the receptors thereby affecting their biological activities (3Kurita-Taniguchi M. Hazeki K. Murabayashi N. Fukui A. Tsuji S. Matsumoto M. Toyoshima K. Seya T. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Delaguillaumie A. Lagaudriere-Gesbert C. Popoff M.R. Conjeaud H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 433-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that govern the recruitment of tetraspanins into TERM and hierarchy of their interactions within these microdomains are not well established. It has been proposed that although each of the tetraspanin components of TERM has a specific proximal non-tetraspanin partner, no preferential partnerships are formed between the tetraspanins themselves (2Shearer M. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Berdichevsky F. Barnes D. Millis R. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, the receptor cross-communication within TERM may be controlled by a variety of tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions. Recent reports have established that while the association with a non-tetraspanin partner is controlled by the large extracellular loop of tetraspanins (5Yauch R.L. Kazarov A.R. Desai B. Lee R.T.

The association between the tetraspanins occurs at the later stages during the protein biosynthesis (presumably, in Golgi or post-Golgi compartments (7Berditchevski F. Gilbert E. Griffiths M.R.

This suggests the following possibilities: (i) the interaction requires a post-translational modification of the proteins (e.g.glycosylation, lipidation); (ii) there may be sorting mechanisms that compartmentalize tetraspanins in proximity to one another thereby allowing the interaction to occur.

In cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), ONOO− increased basal and agonist-stimulated Ser1179 phosphorylation of eNOS, whereas it decreased nitric oxide production and bioactivity.

Moreover, expression of an Akt dominant-negative mutant did not prevent ONOO−-enhanced eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation. In contrast to Akt, ONOO− significantly activated 5′-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), as evidenced by its increased Thr172 phosphorylation as well as increased Ser92 phosphorylation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, a downstream target of AMPK.

In contrast, overexpression of a dominant-negative AMPK mutant attenuated the ONOO−-enhanced eNOS-Ser1179phosphorylation as well as O 2O release.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 5Carton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In addition to allosteric activation by AMP, AMPK is phosphorylated and activated by an upstream kinase, termed AMPK kinase (AMPKK) (6Hawley S.A. Davison M.D. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Activation of AMPK results from phosphorylation of Thr172 in the activation loop of the catalytic α-subunit, although other phosphorylation sites have been reported (7Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Whether or not AMPK is regulated by mechanisms other than the AMP/ATP ratio remains elusive. Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates multiple downstream substrates aimed at conserving existing ATP levels. AMPK reduces further ATP expenditure by inhibiting key enzymes in biosynthetic pathways such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which is important in fatty acid synthesis, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-CoA reductase in cholesterol synthesis (2Hardie D.G.

Despite the recent observation that AMPK phosphorylates eNOS on Ser1179 (based on the bovine eNOS sequence and equivalent to human eNOS-Ser1177) and activates rat cardiac eNOS in vitro (11Chen Z-P Mitchelhill K.I.

Peroxynitrite (ONOO−), a highly reactive oxidant formed by the diffusion-controlled reaction of superoxide anion (O 2O) and nitric oxide (NO), is formed during sepsis, inflammation, diabetes, ischemia-reperfusion, and atherosclerosis and contributes to these pathophysiological processes (13Beckman J.S.

In a recent study we showed that ONOO− oxidizes the zinc-thiolate cluster of eNOS, inhibiting its NO synthetic activity but increasing the NADPH oxidase activity and O 2O production by the enzyme (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further examined how ONOO− regulates eNOS activity. We show that in BAEC cells, ONOO− enhances O 2O release partially by increasing eNOS-Ser1179phosphorylation while inhibiting NO release from the uncoupled enzyme. ONOO− inhibits Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) activity but, in contrast, activates AMPK as shown by increased Thr172phosphorylation of AMPK and Ser92 phosphorylation of ACC, a downstream target of AMPK. In addition, ONOO−significantly increases the association of eNOS and AMPK. Furthermore, by expressing an AMPK dominant-negative mutant, the enhanced activity of AMPK was demonstrated to be required for the increased release of O 2O by the eNOS. BAEC and cell culture media were obtained from Clonetics Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Confluent BAEC were maintained in 2% fetal calf serum and growth factors before use.l-[3H]arginine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Dowex AG50W-X8 columns were obtained from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Cyclic GMP ELISA kit, bovine recombinant NOS, and sepiapeterin were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Poly- and monoclonal antibodies against eNOS were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratory (San Diego, CA). Antibodies against anti-phospho-ACC (Ser79) were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Akt assay kit and antibodies against Akt, phospho-Akt (Thr308 or Ser473), phosphor-eNOS (Ser1177), phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser21/9), phospho-AMPK (Thr172), and AMPK were obtained from Cell Signaling Inc.

Other chemicals and organic solvents of highest grade were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Morris Plains, NJ). BAEC were transfected with adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein, a dominant-negative mutant Akt (Akt-DN) (18Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), constitutively active AMPK (19Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P.

Brozinick J.T., Jr. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). BAEC were transfected in medium with 2% fetal calf serum overnight. The cells were then washed and incubated in fresh EGM medium with 2% fetal calf serum for an additional 24 h prior to experimentation. Using these conditions, transfection efficiency was typically >80% as determined by green fluorescence protein expression. ONOO− was synthesized using a quenched-flow reaction as previously described (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The concentrations of ONOO− were determined spectrally in 0.1m NaOH (ε302 = 1670m−1S−1). ONOO− was diluted in 0.1 m NaOH before use to avoid a sharp shift of pH. Confluent BAEC were treated with ONOO− as described previously (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). 950 μl of 100 mmol/liter HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, was added to confluent cells in 6-well plates. 50 μl of concentrated ONOO− in 0.1 mol/liter NaOH was evenly but quickly added into 6-well plates in rapidly rotating orbital shakers at room temperature. There was no pH shift during treatment with ONOO−. The same volumes of 0.1 mol/liter NaOH or decomposed ONOO− (ONOO− was first decomposed in 1 mol/liter Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and kept for 5 min or overnight) were used as controls. eNOS is a homodimeric enzyme. Under native conditions, eNOS dimers, which are sensitive to temperature but resistant to SDS, run as dimers (∼270 kDa) in low temperature SDS-PAGE (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). When denatured by boiling, eNOS dimers become dissociated and run as monomers with a molecular mass of ∼135 kDa in room temperature SDS-PAGE. Unless otherwise indicated, to distinguish the effects of ONOO− on SDS-resistant eNOS dimers, unboiled samples were examined by low temperature SDS-PAGE. The low temperature SDS-PAGE was performed according to Ref. 17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar. After being washed twice with ice-cold PBS buffer, ONOO−-treated BAEC cells were lysed and sonicated twice. Protein lysates were mixed with 3-fold loading buffer and loaded on 6% gels without boiling. Proteins were separated either with low temperature SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (with β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with a polyclonal antibody against phospho-Ser1179 of eNOS (eNOS-Ser(P)1179, 1:1000, 4 °C overnight). Ser1179 phosphorylation of eNOS was visualized by using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and ECL reagents. To test the specificity of antibody to eNOS-Ser(P)1179 for native proteins, bovine recombinant eNOS purified from SF9 cells were treated with ONOO−, and no staining was found with ONOO−-treated or non-treated recombinant eNOS, indicating that ONOO− did not increase nonspecific binding of eNOS with the antibody. For room temperature SDS-PAGE, cell extracts were mixed with β-mercaptoethanol-containing Laemmli buffer (3×) and boiled for 10 min. Proteins were separated at room temperature and Western blotted onto nitrocellulose. eNOS-Ser(P)1179 was detected as described above. The nitric oxide synthase activity was assayed as described previously (18Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). 5 min after being treated with ONOO−, BAEC cells in 6-well plates were washed twice with 2 ml PBS buffer, pH 7.5, and 1 ml of PBS buffer with 0.1 mmol/liter CaCl2 was added. The cells requiringl-NAME were pre-incubated with l-NAME (500 μmol/liter) for 60 min. The eNOS activity was assayed by incubating BAEC with 10 μml-arginine plus 5 μCi of l-[3H]arginine in the presence of 1 μmol/liter calcium ionophore A23187. After 15 min the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS. The combined medium and PBS were countered for the radioactivity to determine the cellular 3H uptake. After that, the cells were lysed with 250 μl of 100% ethanol for 3 min and were added with 2 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 mml-citrulline, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA). The lysate in stop buffer was then subjected to anion exchange chromatography using 2 ml of Dowex AG50W-X8 columns (0.4 g/ml, Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with stop buffer.l-Citrulline was eluted three times with 1 ml of stop buffer, and the eluent was collected for the determination ofl-[3H]citrulline by liquid scientillation counting. Data is reported as the extent of the conversion ofl-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline that is sensitive to pre-treatment of the BAEC for 30 min with l-NAME and expressed as percent inhibition. Confluent BAEC cells were treated with ONOO− (50 μmmol/liter). After being washed twice with 3 ml of PBS buffer, cells were stimulated with agonists for 15 min. Cells were scraped with cell scrapers on ice and quickly frozen −80 °C before assay. The cellular cGMP contents were assayed by using ELISA kits obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI) as described previously (16Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Akt activity was assayed by using an Akt kinase assay kit obtained from Cell Signaling Inc. (Beverly, MA), as described by the supplier. An antibody to Akt was used to selectively immunoprecipiate Akt from cell lysates. The resulting immunoprecipitates were then incubated with a GSK fusion protein in the presence of ATP and kinase buffer. This allows immunoprecipitated Akt to phosphorylate GSK-3. Phosphorylation of GSK was measured by Western blotting using a phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser21/9) antibody and used as an index of Akt activity. The release of O 2O in cultured BAEC cells was assayed by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochromec reduction by measuring the absorbance at 550 nm (ε550 = 21 mm−1s−1) as described previously (16Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation studies for determining the interaction of AMPK with eNOS were performed as described previously (16Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Confluent BAEC cells in 6-well dishes were pretreated with ONOO− as described above. The cells were washed three times with cold PBS buffer (pH 7.4) immediately after being treated with ONOO−, and 100 μl of lysis buffer was added. Cell lysates (1 mg/ml) were incubated with the antibodies against eNOS (15 μg/ml) or AMPK (15 μg/ml) overnight. Cell proteins were loaded with 3-fold sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were loaded on 6% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The proteins were visualized by using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and ECL reagents. Ser1179 phosphorylation of eNOS has been widely considered as an important mechanism for increasing NO production under conditions such as fluid shear stresses (21Dimmeler S. Fleming I.

Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar) because phosphorylation of Ser1179 in the reductase domain of eNOS enhances the rate of electron flux from the reductase to the oxygenase domain of the enzyme, thus increasing the rate of NO synthesis (28McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). All three NOS isoforms are dimeric enzymes comprised of two identical monomers that are bridged by a zinc tetrathiolate (Zn-S4) cluster. Under native conditions, eNOS, which is sensitive to temperature but resistant to SDS, runs as a dimer under reducing conditions in low temperature SDS-PAGE (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). When denatured, eNOS dimers become dissociated and run as monomers with a molecular mass of ∼135 kDa in normal temperature SDS-PAGE. ONOO− significantly increased O 2O release in BAEC (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), but the mechanism remained unknown. We first addressed whether or not eNOS Ser1179 phosphorylation contributed to ONOO−-induced O 2O release. BAEC were treated with ONOO−, and samples were boiled in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min, and eNOS was separated by room temperature SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.1a, ONOO−, but not decomposed ONOO−, significantly up-regulated eNOS-Ser(P)1179 in BAEC. Our previous studies (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ONOO− oxidizes the ZnS4 cluster, resulting in zinc release and formation of disulfide bonds between the monomeric units. The zinc-depleted eNOS dimers were dissociated under reducing conditions as observed with low temperature SDS-PAGE. In BAEC under the conditions of this study both eNOS dimer, corresponding to a 260-kDa protein, and eNOS monomer (135 kDa) were observed, indicating that the ZnS4 cluster of the enzyme is partially oxidized (Fig. 1b). We first addressed whether or not the integrated status of eNOS protein (i.e.dimer versus monomer) affected the phosphorylation of Ser1179. As shown in Fig. 1b, treatment of BAEC with ONOO− caused a dose-dependent decrease in eNOS dimers and increase in eNOS monomers. On the other hand, ONOO− caused a dose-dependent increase in eNOS-Ser(P)1179 (Fig. 1b). Despite the fact that fewer eNOS dimers were detected by low temperature SDS-PAGE after treatment with ONOO−, the amount of phosphorylated eNOS dimer was significantly increased. ONOO− decomposed in 1m Tris, pH 7.5, for 10 min before addition to the cells did not affect the Ser1179 phosphorylation of eNOS (not shown). Thus, ONOO− has at least two effects on eNOS; it oxidizes the ZnS4 cluster and increases the phosphorylation of Ser1179. As shown in Fig. 1b, eNOS-Ser(P)1179 was mainly detected in eNOS dimers in contrast to weak staining in eNOS monomers. The reason eNOS monomers did not stain with the antibody against Ser1179-P is unknown. It might be due to a lowered affinity of eNOS monomers with the antibody against phosphorylated Ser1179 compared with eNOS dimers. Similarly, we have previously found (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) that eNOS monomers have a lowered affinity with the antibody against eNOS. As shown in Fig. 1c, the increased Ser1179phosphorylation of eNOS was detected in cells harvested immediately after being treated with ONOO−, but phosphorylation persisted for up to 3 h after treatment with ONOO−. The catalytic mechanisms of NOS involve flavin-mediated electron transport from C-terminal-bound NADPH to the N-terminal heme center where oxygen is reduced and incorporated into the guanidine group of l-arginine giving rise to NO andl-citrulline. Therefore, the formation ofl-citrulline can be used as an index of NO release. Because increased eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation is thought to increase NO production, we next determined the effect of ONOO− on NO production and bioactivity in BAEC by monitoring the release of l-citrulline and cyclic GMP. As shown in Fig. 2a, ONOO− significantly inhibited the production of NO. ONOO− did not affect 3H-arginine uptake (data not shown), and supplementation with exogenous l-arginine (up to 1 mmol/liter for 3 h) did not restore ONOO−-induced inhibition of NO release (data not shown), indicating that the effect of ONOO− is not due to decreased uptake or availability of l-arginine. The availability of BH4 is essential for the NO synthetic activity of eNOS, although its role in NOS catalysis is not understood. There is evidence that ONOO− depletes BH4 and thereby promotes eNOS uncoupling. To investigate whether oxidation of BH4 was involved, sepiapterin (100 μmol/liter), which is converted to BH4 by the salvage pathway, or BH4(100 μmol/liter) was immediately added to the cells after ONOO− treatment and incubated for an additional 3h. However, neither sepiapterin nor BH4 restored the NO synthetic activity (l-citrulline formation) of eNOS in ONOO−-treated cells (data not shown), suggesting that depletion of BH4 by ONOO− was unlikely to be involved in ONOO−-mediated eNOS dysfunction. Furthermore, BH4 (100 μmol/liter), which was added to cells immediately before ONOO− addition, did not block ONOO−-induced inhibition on l-citrulline formation (data not shown). Because our previous results (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that supplementation with BH4 (100 μmol/liter) did not prevent loss of recombinant eNOS dimers after ONOO− exposure (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), these results indicated that a zinc-thiolate cluster of eNOS is a preferential target for ONOO−. We have previously (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) demonstrated that treatment of BAEC withl-NAME prevents the increased O 2O release, indicating that it is derived from eNOS. We next investigated whether or not increased Ser1179 phosphorylation of eNOS increased the release of O 2O. As shown in Fig. 2b, ONOO− significantly increased O 2O release in cells exposed to ONOO−, suggesting that after Ser1179 phosphorylation the accelerated electron transfer from the reductase to oxygenase domains of eNOS leads to increased O 2O release. NO exerts its biological effects in part via activation of guanylyl cyclase (GC) to produce cyclic GMP (29Moncada S. Palmer M.J. Higgs A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-141PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, NO bioactivity was assessed in BAEC treated with ONOO− by measuring cyclic GMP levels after stimulation with agonists including calcium ionophore,A23187 (1 μmol/liter), angiotensin-II (1 μmol/liter), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 1 μmol/liter), which normally increase NO production in a calcium-dependent manner. Similar to cells treated with ONOO− under basal conditions, eNOS-Ser(P)1179 was increased in the BAEC cells stimulated with A23187, angiotensin-II, or 5-HT. However, ONOO−significantly attenuated the agonist-induced cyclic GMP formation (Fig.2c), indicating that ONOO− decreased agonist-induced NO bioactivity in BAEC.

Surprisingly, low concentrations of ONOO− significantly inhibited Akt activity as indicated by decreased Akt-dependent GSK-3 phosphorylation (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, overexpression of an Akt dominant-negative mutant, which prevents Akt activation (18Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 25Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A.

In addition, ONOO− decreased the phosphorylation of Akt-Ser473 (Fig. 3c), which is involved in the regulation of Akt activity. Taken together, these results indicate that eNOS-Ser(P)1179 caused by ONOO− was accompanied by decreased Akt activity and was therefore not dependent on Akt. Although it is several-fold less potent than NO in doing so, ONOO− does activate guanylyl cyclase and consequently protein kinase G (31Tarpey M.M. Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Gore J.Z. Brock T.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We therefore addressed whether or not ONOO− increased eNOS-Ser(P)1179 by activating protein kinase G. As shown in Fig. 3d, ODQ (1 μmol/liter), an inhibitor for cyclic GMP production, did not decrease the ONOO−-induced eNOS-Ser(P)1179. Zaprinast (50 μmol/liter), which inhibits phosphodiesterase, preventing the degradation of cyclic GMP, also did not influence the effect of ONOO−(data not shown). Furthermore, inhibition of protein kinase G by KT5823 (1 μmol/liter) did not affect ONOO− induced eNOS-Ser(P)1179, indicating that Ser1179phosphorylation of eNOS by ONOO− is independent of protein kinase G. Protein kinase A is reported to phosphorylate eNOS-Ser1179in response to increased shear stress (22Gallis B. Gorthals G.L. Goodlett D.R. Ubeba H. Kim F. Presnell S.R. Figeys D. Harrison D.G.

Preincubation with H89 (1 μmol/liter), a potent inhibitor of protein kinase A, did not attenuate ONOO−-induced eNOS-Ser1179phosphorylation, suggesting that activation of protein kinase A is unlikely to be responsible. Chen et al. (11Chen Z-P Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapelton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A Power D.A Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) have reported that AMPK phosphorylates eNOS-Ser1179in vitro and in ischemic cardiac myocytes. To investigate whether or not ONOO− causes phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1179 by activating AMPK, BAEC were treated with different concentrations of ONOO−, and cell proteins were stained with a specific antibody against phosphorylated Thr172 of AMPK that is reported to be essential for AMPK activity (7Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4a, ONOO−dose-dependently increased the phosphorylation of AMPK-Thr172. Similar to phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1179, ONOO− increased phosphorylation of AMPK-Thr172 immediately after treatment, lasting at least 30 min (Fig. 4b). Moreover, ONOO− also increased the prolonged phosphorylation of Ser79 of ACC (Fig. 4b), a downstream target that is known to be phosphorylated by AMPK (2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 9Dagher Z. Ruderman N. Tornheim K. Ido Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 265: 112-115Google Scholar, 10Ruderman N.B. Saha S.K. Vavvas D. Witters L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1-E18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that ONOO− treatment activates AMPK in BAEC. Further evidence for the role of AMPK-dependent eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation was obtained in experiments in which constitutively active AMPK (AMPK-CA) and dominant-negative AMPK (AMPK-DN) mutants were expressed with adenoviral vectors. As shown in Fig.5a, overexpression of AMPK-CA, which alone slightly increased e-NOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation (data not shown), did not influence the effect of ONOO− on eNOS-Ser(P)1179. In contrast, overexpression of the AMPK-DN attenuated ONOO− up-regulated eNOS-Ser(P)1179. These results indicate that ONOO−-induced eNOS-Ser(P)1179 requires AMPK activity. We next addressed whether or not phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1179 induced by ONOO− contributes to the increased release of O 2O. Overexpression of the AMPK-CA significantly enhanced ONOO− up-regulated eNOS-Ser(P)1179. In contrast, overexpression of AMPK-DN, which attenuated ONOO−-induced eNOS-Ser(P)1179, only partially blocked ONOO−-induced O 2O release, indicating that the AMPK-dependent eNOS-Ser(P)1179 accounts for only part of the increased release of O 2O from eNOS caused by ONOO−. Because we showed that ONOO− also increased O 2O from recombinant eNOS in which no phosphorylation occurs, it is likely that the increased production of O 2O from eNOS is accounted for both by oxidation of the Zn-S4group as well as eNOS-Ser(P)1179. Previous studies (11Chen Z-P Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapelton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A Power D.A Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that AMPK co-immunoprecipitates with eNOS. As shown in Fig. 5c, ONOO− increased the association of AMPK and eNOS. Similar results were obtained either with immunoprecipitation of eNOS and staining for AMPK or with immunoprecipitation of AMPK and staining for eNOS. Ser1179 phosphorylation of eNOS has been widely considered to be an important mechanism for increased NO production under the influence of fluid shear stress (21Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although mutation of Ser1179 to alanine attenuates agonist-induced eNOS activity (21Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar), our results suggest that Ser1179 phosphorylation can only be regarded as an indicator of the activation status of eNOS regardless of whether it is making NO or O 2O. Whether or not Ser1179 phosphorylation leads to increased NO release is likely dependent on the redox status of the ZnS4 cluster of eNOS, as well as possibly levels of its substrate,l-arginine, or the cofactor, BH4. It is likely that the increased O 2O release observed from eNOS exposed to ONOO− originates from the increased amounts of eNOS with oxidized ZnS4 centers. Ser1179 phosphorylation of eNOS likely accounts in part for the increase in catalytic activity of eNOS in cells exposed to ONOO−. The phosphorylation of Ser1179 in eNOS with intact ZnS4 clusters might produce some NO, but it is likely that at least some NO is rapidly converted to ONOO− upon reacting with O 2O. ONOO− produced in this manner would not only likely further the oxidation of ZnS4clusters, increasing the uncoupling of the enzyme and O 2Oproduction, but also oxidize other endothelial proteins, as we previously demonstrated (16Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) for prostacyclin synthase. Because our previous studies (17Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) showed that in vivo, eNOS is partially oxidized in tissues of diabetic mice, it is highly likely that ONOO− regulates eNOS activity and its product formation in vivo. In addition, other regulators of eNOS function may be dependent on the redox status of the ZnS4cluster. For example, the mechanisms described here are likely important to understand the recent observation that inhibition of HSP90 with geldanamycin significantly increases O 2O production while increasing Ser1179 phosphorylation of eNOS (32Pritchard K.A., Jr. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In summary, the main finding of the present study is that ONOO− inhibits Akt-dependent and increases AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1179. ONOO− activates AMPK and increases the association of AMPK with eNOS, whereas it inhibits Akt-activity. AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1179 likely contributes to increased O 2O and ONOO− production by eNOS. We conclude that phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1179 reflects only the activated state of eNOS rather than whether it can generate NO or O 2O, which depends rather on the integrity of the ZnS4 cluster of the protein."

We have shown that the C-terminal domain of the P2X7receptor is responsible for the cell blebbing phenotype. A screen for proteins that associate with the C-terminal domain of the P2X7 receptor and might mediate the blebbing phenotype, identified epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP-2). The interaction between EMP-2 and P2X7 was confirmed biochemically by co-immunoprecipitation, co-purification, and glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays, and this interaction was entirely dependent on the C-terminal domain of P2X7. The P2X7 receptor also interacted with the other members of the epithelial membrane protein family (EMP-1, EMP-3, and PMP-22). All four EMPs were found to be expressed in HEK-293 cells and in THP-1 monocytes, which express P2X7 receptors. Interestingly, the constitutive overexpression of any of the EMPs in HEK-293 cells led to cell blebbing, annexin V binding, and cell death, by a caspase-dependent pathway.

Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), all with the same predicted topology of two transmembrane domains and intracellular N and C termini (1North R.A. Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The P2X7 receptor shares 40–45% amino acid identity with the other P2X proteins, but it is structurally distinct at the C terminus, extending for an additional 100–200 amino acids (2Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). P2X1–6 receptors are widely distributed in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, whereas P2X7 receptors are most highly expressed in immune and epithelial cells (3Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Collo G. Neidhart S. Kawashima E. Kosco-Vilbois M. North R.A. Buell G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Brief stimulation (10–30 s) of the P2X7 receptor leads to the formation of a channel permeable to large cations, as is also seen for some of the other P2X receptors (2Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 5Virginio C. MacKenzie A.B. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, more prolonged activation of the P2X7 receptor results in extensive membrane blebbing from within seconds to minutes (5Virginio C. MacKenzie A.B. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and eventual cell death (5Virginio C. MacKenzie A.B. North R.A. Surprenant A. J.

Syst. 2000; 81: 64-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although such responses are not observed with other P2X receptors. We hypothesized that the C terminus of the P2X7receptor might engage other cellular proteins to mediate its distinct responses of membrane blebbing and cell death. We tested this hypothesis by using a construct containing the soluble C-terminal domain (Asn356–Tyr595) of the rat P2X7 protein as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Because HEK-293 cells expressing P2X7 receptors exhibit pronounced blebbing and eventual cell death when stimulated with ATP (5Virginio C. MacKenzie A.B. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar),we sought interacting proteins using a HEK-293 cell library.RESULTSPrevious studies on the P2X7 receptor have shown that truncation of the receptor by removal of most of the intracellular C terminus reduces YOPRO-1 dye uptake and channel dilatation (2Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). We have now verified that the C terminus is required for the P2X7receptor-mediated cell blebbing. In HEK-293 cells expressing the wild-type (WT) rP2X7 receptor, cells underwent membrane disruption within 1 min of activation with 100 μm Bz-ATP, whereas cells transfected with the truncated (Δ418) rP2X7receptor did not show any significant membrane disruption over a 4-min stimulation with 100 μm Bz-ATP (Fig.1, A–C). Both the WT rP2X7 receptor and the truncated receptor were expressed on the cell surface as determined by immunocytochemistry (Fig.1A). In agreement with previous electrophysiological recordings (2Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar), the Δ418 truncated rP2X7 receptor was shown to form a functional channel, because cells loaded with the calcium indicator Fluo-4AM displayed a prolonged Ca2+ rise after stimulation with 100 μm Bz-ATP (Fig.1B). Therefore, the P2X7 receptor C terminus is required for ATP-mediated cell blebbing. For this reason we used this intracellular domain to probe for interacting proteins, which might mediate this response.EMP-2 was identified as a strong positive hit in the yeast two-hybrid screen of a HEK-293 cell cDNA library with the P2X7receptor C terminus (P2X7CT). The interaction was confirmed by isolation of the EMP-2 Gal-4 activation domain fusion plasmid, retransformation into Y190 cells and assaying for growth on His− plates, and β-galactosidase activity. The interaction between full-length P2X7 receptor and EMP-2 was further tested using biochemical approaches. EMP-2myc/His was cotransfected with the rP2X7 receptor into HEK-293 cells; P2X7 receptor was copurified from cell extracts with EMP-2 attached to a cobalt affinity resin (Fig.2A, lane 5). In the absence of EMP-2myc/His, only a low background level of rP2X7 bound the cobalt affinity resin (Fig. 2A,lane 4). A complementary experiment was performed whereby EMP-2myc/His was co-immunoprecipitated with P2X7EE using an EE monoclonal antibody (Fig.2B). No EMP-2 was immunoprecipitated in the absence of P2X7EE (Fig. 2B, lane 2), nor did EMP-2 co-immunoprecipitate with an EE-tagged mRNA export factor, Ref 2–1EE (Fig. 2B, lane 3).Figure 2EMP-2 copurifies and co-immunoprecipitates with P2X7 receptor.A, cotransfection of EMP-2myc/His with P2X7 in HEK-293 cells followed by purification of EMP-2 using a cobalt-affinity resin resulted in the copurification of P2X7 (lane 5). Cells expressing only P2X7 receptors bound negligibly to the resin (lane 4). B, immunopreciptation of cell extracts expressing P2X7EE or Ref 2–1EE with EMP-2myc/His with anti-EE results in coprecipitation of EMP-2 with P2X7 (lane 4) but not with Ref 2–1EE (lane 3).

RT-PCR using primers specific for each family member on extracts of HEK-293 cells indicated the presence of all four mRNAs (Fig.3A). Contamination by genomic DNA is unlikely because primers to β-actin (that span a short intron) gave a product of the expected size of the cDNA, and all EMP primers were chosen to span introns in the genomic sequences. RT-PCR products were also confirmed by sequencing. The RT-PCR was repeated on extracts from THP-1 monocytes, and mRNAs encoding all four EMP members were detected (Fig. 3B). Each of the family members (Myc/His-tagged) were co-expressed in HEK-293 cells with the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor copurified with each of the His-tagged proteins on the cobalt affinity resin (Fig.3C).Figure 3EMPs are expressed by HEK-293 cells and THP-1 monocytes and interact with P2X7 receptor.A, message for PMP-22, EMP-1, EMP-2, and EMP-3 was detected by RT-PCR of HEK-293 mRNA. The product size (241 bp) with actin primers is predicted from mRNA; amplification of genomic DNA would give a product of 400 bp. Other product sizes were as expected. B, message for PMP-22, EMP-1, EMP-2, and EMP-3 was detected by RT-PCR of THP-1 mRNA, using the same methods as for A. C, overexpression of four EMPs (with myc/His tags) with P2X7 in HEK-293 cells was followed by purification using a cobalt-affinity resin to bind the His tag. This resulted in the copurification of P2X7 with EMP-2, EMP-1, EMP-3, and PMP-22.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also sought to confirm directly an interaction between the C terminus of the P2X7 receptor and the EMPs. Extracts were prepared from HEK-293 cells transfected with PMP-22, EMP-1, EMP-2, EMP-3, and Ref-2–1 (each Myc/His-tagged). Expression of the proteins was confirmed by direct analysis of samples of the extracts by immunoblotting with the Myc antibody (Fig.4A). Several bands were observed for the Myc-tagged EMPs because they exhibit different glycosylation states (12Ryan M.C. Notterpek L. Tobler A.R. Liu N. Shooter E.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1465-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Extracts were incubated either with GST (control) or GST-P2X7CT. The PMP-22, EMP-1, EMP-2, and EMP-3 proteins were pulled down by GST-P2X7CT although not by GST alone (Fig. 4B). No pull-down of any Myc-labeled products in the presence of GST-P2X7CT was observed using control extracts of HEK-293 mock-transfected or Ref 2–1myc-transfected cells. A deletion mutant of the P2X7 receptor lacking the C terminus (to residue N356, ΔCT-P2X7EE) was not capable of co-immunoprecipitating EMP-2 (Fig. 4C). The truncated receptor was expressed at the cell surface in a similar pattern to the WT P2X7 receptor (Fig. 4D). This indicates that EMPs specifically interact with the C terminus of the P2X7 receptor.Figure 4EMPs interact with the P2X7receptor C terminus.A, expression of EMPs or Ref 2–1myc in crude HEK-293 cell extracts before GST pull-downs was verified by immunoblotting with anti-Myc. B, these cell extracts were then reacted with GST or GST-P2X7CT bound to glutathione–Sepharose. Specific pull-down of PMP-22 and EMP 1,2, and 3 with GST–P2X7CT, compared with GST alone, was detected by c-Myc immunoblotting, whereas no pull-down was obtained for Ref 2–1myc. C, immunopreciptation of cell extracts expressing P2X7EE, or truncated P2X7EE (truncated to residue 356: ΔCTP2X7EE), or Ref 2–1EE with EMP-2myc/His, using anti-EE, results in coprecipitation of EMP-2 with P2X7 (lane 2) but not with the truncated receptor ΔCTP2X7EE (lane 3) nor with Ref 2–1EE (lane 4). EMP-2 was detected by immunoblotting with the c-Myc antibody. D, the truncated receptor, ΔCTP2X7EE, was expressed in a similar pattern to the WT receptor (P2X7EE), as assessed by immunocytochemistry using anti-EE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overexpression of PMP-22 and EMP-2 in NIH-3T3 cells has previously been shown to cause cell rounding, blebbing, and a reduction in survival rate (13Fabbretti E.

Blood. 2001; 97: 3890-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether overexpression of all four members of the family mediate similar effects in HEK-293 cells. Overexpression of each protein led to a significant increase in cell death. A significantly higher release of LDH occurred in EMP-transfected cells after 36 h of treatment in low serum (Fig.5A). In addition, an increase in trypan blue uptake was observed as determined by cell counting (Fig.5B), compared with control mock-transfected cells also maintained in low serum. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of HEK-293 cells 48 h after transfection showed that each member of the EMP family resulted in a significant proportion of annexin-positive cells (Fig. 5, C and D). Mock-transfected cells and cells transfected with P2X2receptor cDNAs showed no significant annexin binding. The high percentage of propidium-positive cells in the mock-transfected control (Fig. 5C) is likely caused by the addition of transfection reagent. The LDH release and trypan blue uptake in EMP-overexpressing cells was significantly inhibited by the addition of the caspase inhibitor, z-VAD (Fig. 5, A and B).Figure 5Overexpression of epithelial membrane proteins induces cell death. Plasmids encoding each epithelial membrane protein were separately transfected into HEK-293 cells. At 12 h after transfection, cells were incubated in 1% serum supplemented with either 0.5% Me2SO or 30 μmz-VAD in 0.5% Me2SO. A, after 36 h, a sample of supernatant was withdrawn and assayed for LDH content (Sigma kit). An equivalent HEK-293 cell sample was treated with 1% Triton X-100 and assayed for LDH content, which was taken as the 100% maximal release. B, at 48 h after treatment, cells were harvested and viable vs. nonviable cells were assayed by trypan blue exclusion. C, HEK-293 cells overexpressing each EMP family member were tested for annexin V binding by flow cytometry, using propidium iodide (PI) as a cell-dead stain. For each sample, a cell count of 2,500 cells was taken, and cells were gated into four quadrants where Q1 is the proportion of nonviable (PI-positive), non-annexin V-bound cells; Q2 is PI-positive non-viable annexin V-positive cells; Q3 is PI-negative (viable) annexin V-negative cells; and Q4 represents annexin V-positive viable (PI-negative) cells. Typical flow cytometry traces are shown for mock-transfected, staurosporine-treated, and EMP-2 overexpressing HEK-293 cells. D, annexin V binding measured in the Q4 gating. Each column shows the percentage of annexin-positive/propidium-negative cells. In each experiment, 100% was assigned to the number of annexin-positive/propidium-negative cells observed with staurosporin (1 μm) treatment (n = 4 in each case).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunocytochemistry of HEK-293 cells transfected with each of the EMP cDNAs (Myc/His tagged) showed predominant staining at the cell surface (Fig. 6). All cells transfected with PMP-22, EMP-1, EMP-2, or EMP-3 exhibited several large membrane blebs on their surfaces (Fig. 6).Figure 6Overexpression of EMPs induces cell blebbing. Blebbing of the membrane was observed 48 h after HEK-293 cells were transfected with each of the EMPs. Immunocytochemistry was performed using the anti-Myc antibody to detect Myc-tagged EMPs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe P2X7 receptor is functionally distinct compared with the other members of the ATP-gated ion channel family because its activation leads to membrane blebbing (5Virginio C. MacKenzie A.B. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that the unique intracellular C terminus of the P2X7receptor is required for this response. The removal of the C-terminal domain of P2X7 also greatly reduces the uptake of dyes such as YOPRO-1, but it does not grossly alter the ATP-gated cation channel function (2Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar).The search for proteins that interact with the C-terminal domain of P2X7, and may be involved in the membrane-blebbing phenotype, led to the identification of EMP-2. EMP-2 consists of 167 amino acids containing four predicted transmembrane domains (16Taylor V. Suter U. Gene. 1996; 175: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and exhibits 40% amino acid identity to PMP-22. In addition, two other related proteins have been identified by random sequencing of a mouse intestine library (EMP-1 (17Lobsiger C.S. Magyar J.P. Taylor V. Wulf P. Welcher A.A. Program A.E. Suter U. Genomics. 1996; 36: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) and from related expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences (EMP-3 (16Taylor V. Suter U. Gene. 1996; 175: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). Direct interaction of EMP-2 and the C terminus of the P2X7 receptor was verified by using biochemical approaches—copurification, coimmunoprecipitation, and GST pull-down assays. In addition, the related proteins EMP-1, EMP-3, and PMP-22 were also found to interact with the P2X7CT using these same techniques. Notably these interactions did not depend on activation of the P2X7receptor. Consistent with a role in the membrane-blebbing phenotype of P2X7 and not its channel functions, overexpression of EMP-2 in HEK-293 cells had no significant effect on P2X7-activated cation currents, YOPRO-1 uptake, or a significant shift in the EC50 value for Bz-ATP (data not shown).P2X7 has previously been found to associate with a multiprotein complex including cytoskeletal proteins, heat shock proteins, and two integral membrane proteins, receptor-phosphotyrosine phosphatase-β (RPTPβ) and integrin β2, although the domains of the P2X7 receptor responsible for most of these interactions have not yet been determined (18Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the P2X7 receptor is generally thought to be entirely intracellular, whereas EMPs have a predominantly intramembrane disposition with only a small part of the protein likely to be intracellular (amino acids 86–94 in EMP-2), although this domain may be sufficient for the observed interactions. Alternatively, there is a significantly hydrophobic segment in the P2X7 receptor C terminus (amino acids 512–536), raising the possibility that the main interaction occurs between hydrophobic regions within the membrane.The EMPs share 22–25% similarity to the “stargazin” or voltage-gated channel ã subunits, with common exon–intron boundaries and alignment of the four transmembrane domains (Fig.7). This is of interest, as the γ subunits (γ1–γ8) have been shown to interact with neuronal voltage-dependent calcium channels (19Kang M.-G. Chen C.-C. Felix R. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Mori Y.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1514-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating that the P2X7 receptor–EMP interaction is not unique, and a number of ion channels may form complexes with tetra-span membrane proteins.Figure 7EMPs share homology to the γ subunits of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels.

Genetic studies and the generation of PMP-22-deficient mice have established that it is responsible for a set of inherited peripheral neuropathies in mice and humans. One type of Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT1A) results from a mutation in PMP-22 (21Valentijn L.J. Baas F. Wolterman R.A. Hoogendijk J.E. van den Bosch N.H. Zorn I. Gabreels-Festen A.W. de Visser M. Bolhuis P.A. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, which also involves impaired nerve conductions, is a product of a deletion within the PMP-22 gene (22Chance P.F. Alderson M.K. Leppig K.A. Lensch M.W. Matsunami N. Smith B. Swanson P.D. Odelberg S.J. Disteche C.M. Bird T.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 143-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In rodents, point mutations of PMP-22 are associated with the “Trembler” phenotype due to impaired conduction in peripheral nerves (23Suter U. Welcher A.A. Ozcelik T. Snipes G.J. Kosaras B. Francke U. Billings Gagliardi S. Sidman R.L. Shooter E.M. Nature. 1992; 356: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). However, the wide tissue distribution of PMP-22 suggests that it may play a more general role than in myelin formation. PMP-22 was originally isolated from NIH-3T3 cells and was first named gas-3 for its growth arrest-dependent expression (24Schneider C. King R.M. Philipson L. Cell. 1988; 54: 787-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Northern analysis has shown that each member of the EMP family, including PMP-22, is widely expressed (16Taylor V. Suter U. Gene. 1996; 175: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Schneider C. King R.M. Philipson L. Cell. 1988; 54: 787-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), and there is considerable overlap with the tissue distribution of P2X7 receptors. For example, many epithelial cells express both EMPs and P2X7 receptors (4Collo G. Neidhart S. Kawashima E. Kosco-Vilbois M. North R.A. Buell G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). PMP-22 is highly expressed in Schwann cells (25Spreyer P. Kuhn G. Hanemann C.O. Gillen C. Schaal H. Kuhn R. Lemke G. Muller H.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Baechner D. Liehr T. Hameister H. Altenberger H. Grehl H. Suter U. Rautenstrauss B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), where there is also good functional evidence for P2X7 receptors (27Grafe P. Mayer C. Takigawa T. Kamleiter M. Sanchez-Brandelik R. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,28Colomar A. Amedee T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 927-936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The RT-PCR analysis confirmed that mRNAs encoding all members of the EMP family are present in both HEK-293 cells and in THP-1 monocytes. P2X7 receptors are strongly expressed in THP-1 monocytes, and their activation is an important trigger for interleukin-1β release (29MacKenzie A. Wilson H.L. Kiss-Toth E. Dower S.K. North R.A. Surprenant A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). After prolonged stimulation, P2X7 receptors mediate ATP-induced killing in human macrophages (30Kusner D.J. Adams J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Humphreys B.D. Rice J. Kertesy S.B. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26792-26798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In NIH-3T3 cells, overexpression of PMP-22 also causes cell rounding, blebbing, and a reduction in the survival rate (13Fabbretti E. Edomi P. Brancolini C. Schneider C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1846-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Brancolini C. Marzinotto S. Edomi P. Agostoni E. Fiorentini C. Muller H.W. Schneider C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2441-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and recently bleb formation has been reported following overexpression of EMP-2 (15Wang C.X. Wadehra M. Fisk B.C. Goodglick L. Braun J. Blood. 2001; 97: 3890-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have now extended these observations, and shown that membrane blebbing is induced and cell survival is decreased when any one of the EMPs is overexpressed in HEK-293 cells, as evidenced by increased LDH release, trypan blue uptake, annexin V binding, and immunofluorescence. The cell death could be inhibited by the addition of the caspase inhibitor, z-VAD, indicating that overexpression of EMP-1, EMP-2, EMP-3, or PMP-22 results in a caspase-dependent apoptotic-like phenotype.Although overexpression of EMPs leads to constitutive cell blebbing, the normal cellular trigger for an EMP to manifest this response is currently unknown. This study indicates that EMPs can associate with other integral membrane proteins such as the P2X7 receptor, which under the appropriate conditions (i.e. ATP stimulation), can provide that trigger and promote blebbing, although the mechanism by which the P2X7–EMP complex could promote cell blebbing is not understood at present. Because EMPs are widely expressed, even in cells lacking P2X7, this would suggest they may have additional integral membrane protein partners that link EMP-like proteins to apoptosis pathways. Identification of such proteins will be an important goal for the future together with understanding the mechanisms involved in the constitutive cell blebbing observed when EMP proteins are overexpressed. P2X7 receptors belong to a family of ion channels gated by extracellular ATP (1North R.A. Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), all with the same predicted topology of two transmembrane domains and intracellular N and C termini (1North R.A. Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The P2X7 receptor shares 40–45% amino acid identity with the other P2X proteins, but it is structurally distinct at the C terminus, extending for an additional 100–200 amino acids (2Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). P2X1–6 receptors are widely distributed in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, whereas P2X7 receptors are most highly expressed in immune and epithelial cells (3Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Collo G. Neidhart S. Kawashima E. Kosco-Vilbois M. North R.A. Buell G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Brief stimulation (10–30 s) of the P2X7 receptor leads to the formation of a channel permeable to large cations, as is also seen for some of the other P2X receptors (2Surprenant A. Rassendren F.

In contrast to its anti-inflammatory properties, IL-10 also has well defined pro-inflammatory and immunostimulatory effector functions. They include the ability to stimulate thymocyte, T cell, B cell, and mast cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine elaboration and to activate endothelial cells (14De Beaux A.C. Maingay J.P.

Although IL-10 has been proposed to be a useful therapeutic agent that can be chronically administered to patients with inflammatory disorders, the chronic effects of IL-10 in the lung and other organs have not been adequately defined. The complexities of IL-10 are nicely illustrated in its role in the pathogenesis and treatment of asthma. A number of lines of evidence suggest that IL-10 has a predominantly anti-inflammatory effect in this setting. This includes in vitro studies that demonstrate that IL-10 inhibits Th2 cell cytokine elaboration (9Van Scott M.R. Justice P. Bradfield J.F. Enright E. Sigounas A. Sur S. Am. J.

Similarly, some in vivo studies have demonstrated a relative deficiency in the production and/or accumulation of IL-10 in asthmatics (12Chung K.F. Eur. Respir.

This led to the belief that decreased IL-10 production contributes to the chronic inflammation that is characteristic of asthma and that rIL-10 could be a useful therapeutic in this disorder (6Koulis A.

This is based on studies that demonstrate that IL-10 augments antigen-induced eosinophilic inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, airway mucus metaplasia, and IL-5 elaboration in acute asthma models (9Van Scott M.R.

The degree to which chronic IL-10 can, by itself, induce or exacerbate inflammatory, mucus, and fibrotic responses comparable to those in asthmatic airways has, however, not been investigated. To further understand the chronic effects of IL-10 in the lung, we generated and characterized mice in which IL-10 was chronically overexpressed in the airway. These studies demonstrate that IL-10, although inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-induced tissue inflammation and TNF production, simultaneously induces a B and T cell-rich inflammatory response, mucus metaplasia, and airway remodeling. They also demonstrate that IL-10-induces these responses via multiple mechanisms, with the mucus response and the inflammatory and fibrotic responses being mediated by IL-13-dependent and -independent pathways, respectively. Construct pKS-CC10-rtTA-hGH, which contains the 2.3-kb rat CC10 promoter (a gift from Dr. J. Whitsett, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH), reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA), and human growth hormone (hGH) intronic and polyadenylation sequences was prepared as described previously by our laboratory (36Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn C.I. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Plasmid pcD(Salpha)-F115, which contains the murine IL-10 cDNA, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC no. 68027) The IL-10 cDNA in this plasmid was then amplified using the following PCR primers: 5′-CACTAAGCTTGCCACAAAGC-3′ and 5′-TCCACAGGATCCGTGTTTTAGC-3′. The PCR amplification product was then subcloned into pKS-CC10-rtTA-hGH replacing the rtTA with IL-10. This yielded the construct pKS-CC10-IL-10-hGH. After the fidelity of the junction areas and the IL-10 cDNA was confirmed by sequencing, the construct (Fig.1 A) was digested, isolated, purified, dialyzed, and microinjected as previously described (36Ray P.

The presence or absence of the transgene in the resulting animals and their progeny was determined using tail DNA and Southern blot analysis with 32P-labeled murine IL-10 cDNA as a probe or PCR. The primers 5′-TGCTATGCTGCCTGCTCTTA-3′ and 5′-TCATTTCCGATAAGGCTTGG-3′ were used for PCR genotyping. The following PCR protocol was employed: 95 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Mice were euthanized, the trachea was isolated by blunt dissection, and small caliber tubing was inserted and secured in the airway. Three sequential 0.75-ml volumes of PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin were then instilled and gently aspirated and pooled. BAL fluid samples were centrifuged, and supernatants were stored at −70 °C until used. The levels of IL-10 were determined with a commercial ELISA as per instructions from the manufacturer (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). mRNA levels were assessed using RT-PCR and ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) as previously described by our laboratory (38Wang J.M.

Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In the RT-PCR assays, gene-specific primers were used to amplify selected regions of each target moiety. The primers and reactions for the Muc-1, Muc-2, Muc-5ac, and β-actin have been previously described (40Parmley R.R. Gendler S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1798-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The other primer sequences (5′ to 3′) are as follows: Muc-4, TCACTGGTAACCGCTTGCTTC and CATCCTGGGGGCTGTAGAC; surfactant D, CTCTCGCAGAGATCAGTACC and GGAAAGCAGCCTTGTTGTGG; IL-4, TCAACCCCCAGCTAGTTGTC and TTCAAGCATGGAGTTTTCCC; IL-5, ATGGAGATTCCCATGAGCAC and GTCTCTCCTCGCCACACTTC; IL-9, GAAGGATGATCCACCGTCAAAATGC and CGTCCCCAGGAGACTCTTCAGAAATG; IL-10, CACTAAGCTTGCCACAAAGC and TCCACAGGATCCGTGTTTTAGC; IL-13, AGACCAGACTCCCCTGTGCA and TGGGTCCTGTAGATGGCATTG; Gob-5, CACAACCACTAAGGTGGCCT and AGGTGTTGAAGTGGTCCCTG; transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β1), CTGTCCAAACTAAGGCTCGC and CGTCAAAAGACAGCCACTCA; interferon-γ (IFN-γ), ACTGGCAAAAGGATGGTCAC and TGAGCTCATTGAATGCTTGG; and L32, TCCAGAGACCATCCATCCTC and ATCCTCTTGCCCTGAATCCTT. To verify that equal amounts of undegraded RNA were added in each RT-PCR reaction, β-actin was used as an internal standard. Amplified PCR products were detected using 1.2% agarose ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis, quantitated electronically, and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. RPA assays were performed using the RiboQuant kit purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). These assays were performed according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Histologic evaluations of 10% formalin, pressure-fixed (25 cm) lungs, and formalin-fixed extrathoracic tissues were obtained as previously described (37Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Wang Z. Chen Q. Geba G.P.

Hematoxylin and eosin, Mallory's trichrome, periodic acid-Schiff with diastase (PAS), and Alcian blue stains were performed in the Research Pathology Laboratory at Yale University. To analyze the inflammatory cells in IL-10 transgenic mice, we stained frozen tissue sections with FITC- or PE-labeled antibodies against cell surface markers. In these experiments lungs were perfused, inflated, and fixed overnight at 4 °C with paraformaldehyde lysine periodate solution (0.001 m periodate, 0.075 m lysine, 1% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4). Cryoprotection was accomplished by consecutive 20-min incubations in graded cold sucrose solutions (10, 20, and 30% in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). The lungs were then inflated with a 40% optimal cutting temperature solution diluted in PBS; cryomolds were prepared with optimal cutting temperature; and 7-μm tissue sections were prepared on microscopic glass slides, air-dried at room temperature, and stored at −80 °C for further use. For immunofluorescence staining, the slides were washed and rehydrated with TN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5m NaCl, pH 7.4) for 5 min, and blocked with 100 μl of 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. PE- and FITC-labeled antibodies were directly added onto the samples and incubated overnight at 4 °C. PE-labeled anti-mouse CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (GK 1.5), CD45/B220 (RA3-6B2), and I-Ab (Aαb) (25-9-3) antibodies and FITC-labeled anti-mouse CD3, CD4, CD45/220, and CD8a (Ly-2) antibodies were purchased from BD PharMingen and used for single or double staining with a combination of PE- and FITC-conjugated antibodies. The slides were then washed three times with TN buffer, mounted, evaluated, and photographed using the fluorescent settings on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning inverted microscope (Axiovert 100M, Zeiss). The laser was set at 488 nm for green (FITC) fluorescence and 568 nm for red (PE) fluorescence. BAL was performed, as described above, on transgene (−) and transgene (+) mice before and 6 h after the intratracheal administration of 50 μl of LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0.55:B5, 100 ng/ml) (Sigma) or appropriate vehicle control. Total cell and neutrophil recovery were then assessed. BAL TNF levels were evaluated using a commercial ELISA (R&D, Inc.) as per instructions from the manufacturer. To be able to characterize the expression of the Muc-4 gene in transgenic and control mice, the nucleotide sequence of murine Muc-4 needed to be defined. To accomplish this we designed the PCR primers based on the regions that were conserved in both the human Muc-4 and rat ascites sialoglycoprotein-2 sequences (41Wu K. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11950-11955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Moniaux N. Nollet S. Porchet N. Degand P. Laine A. Aubert J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The sense 5′-TCACTGGTAACCGCTGCTTC-3′ and antisense 5′-CATCCTGGGGGCTGGTAGAC-3′ primers encompassed the 3′-flanking region of human Muc-4 and the 5′-coding region of rat ascites sialoglycoprotein-2. After reverse transcription and 30 cycles of PCR amplification with a 60 °C annealing temperature, the 513-bp amplified product was purified and cloned into a TA cloning vector (pCR-II, Invitrogen). The inserted cDNA was sequenced, and the nucleotide and corresponding protein sequences were submitted to GenBankTM (accession no.AF218819). The histologic mucus index (HMI) provides a measurement of the percentage of epithelial cells that are PAS (+) per unit airway basement membrane. It is calculated from PAS-stained sections as described previously by our laboratories (38Wang J.M. Homer R.J. Hong L. Cohn L. Lee C.G. Elias J.A. J.

To quantitate the levels of mucins in BAL fluids from transgene (+) and transgene (−) mice, 0.1 ml of BAL fluid was slot blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Minifold II slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After air-drying, the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in TTBS (0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-Cl, 500 mm NaCl) for 2 h and washed three times with TTBS. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal antiserum against Mucin-1 (C-20; Santa Cruz Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), a monoclonal antibody against Mucin-2 (Ccp58, Santa Cruz Inc.), or a monoclonal antibody against Mucin-5AC (45M1; NeoMarkers, Union City, CA). After washing with TTBS, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-goat immunoglobulin (Ig)-G (Pierce). Immunoreactive mucins were detected using a chemiluminescent procedure (ECL Plus Western blotting detection system, Amersham Biosciences) according to instructions from the manufacturer. In situ hybridization was undertaken as previously described (43Lee C.G. Homer R.J. Zhu Z. Lanone S. Wang X. Koteliansky V. Shipley J.M. Gotwals P. Noble P. Chen Q. Senior R.M. Elias J.A. J. Exp.

The mouse Gob-5 gene probe contained the segment from the mouse Gob-5 sequence between base pairs 1027 and 1465 (GenBankTM accession no. NM_011577). IL-10 transgene (+) mice were bred with mice with null mutations of IL-4Rα, IL-13, STAT-6, and IL-4. The IL-4Rα (−/−) mice were obtained from Dr. F. Brombacher (44Noben-Trauth N. Shultz L.D.

McKenzie (45McKenzie G.J. Bancroft A. Grencis R.K. McKenzie A.N. Curr.

The levels of total and bioactive TGF-β1 were evaluated using an ELISA that was specific for bioactive TGF-β1 (R&D, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Evaluations were undertaken with acid-treated and untreated BAL fluids from 1–3-month-old transgene (+) and littermate control animals as previously described (43Lee C.G. Homer R.J. Zhu Z. Lanone S. Wang X. Koteliansky V. Shipley J.M. Gotwals P. Noble P. Chen Q. Senior R.M. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 809-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Mice were sensitized intradermally, at the base of the tail, with 5 × 105 plaque-forming units of vaccinia virus (VV) expressing secreted RSV G glycoprotein (a gift from Dr. G. W. Wertz, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL) or with control vaccinia virus expressing β-galactosidase (vac-lac; a gift from Dr. B. Moss, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Six weeks later the mice were challenged with 1 × 107plaque-forming units (in 0.1 ml) of live RSV virus A2 strain, which was administered intranasally and aspirated into the lung. Four days after challenge the mice were sacrificed, their lungs were removed, and mucin gene expression was assessed with RT-PCR analysis as described. Comparisons were made of the levels of mucin gene expression in (a) wild-type (WT) mice and IL-10 (−/−) mice (Jackson Laboratories), (b) WT mice treated with 0.2 mg of either a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against IL-10 (clone JES5.2A5, Genetics Institute, Cambridge MA) or an IgG1 isotype control (American Type Culture Collection), and (c) WT mice treated with the IL-13 antagonist IL-13 Rα2-Fc (a gift from Dr. Sandy Goldman, Wyeth Inc., Cambridge, MA) or an appropriate Ig control. These antibody interventions were administered on days −1, 0, and + 1 with respect to the live virus challenge. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. As appropriate, groups were compared by analysis of variance with Scheffe's procedure post hoc analysis, Student's t test, or nonparametric assessments (Wilcoxon's rank sum, Mann-Whitney U test) using StatView software for the Macintosh (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). To generate transgenic mice in which IL-10 is selectively expressed in the lung, constructs containing the CC10 promoter and murine IL-10 were prepared (Fig.1 A), standard microinjection was undertaken, tail DNA was isolated, and the presence or absence of IL-10 transgenic sequences was determined via Southern blot analysis and PCR. Four animals contained the appropriate transgenic construct. Independent lines were subsequently generated by breeding these founders with C57BL/6 mice, and the appropriateness of gene expression in each line was evaluated. Qualitatively, similar phenotypes were seen on all four lines. The details of these phenotypes are described below. To determine whether IL-10 was appropriately targeted to the lung, we quantitated the levels of BAL IL-10 and compared the levels of IL-10 mRNA in the lungs and extrapulmonary organs from transgene (+) and transgene (−) mice. The BAL fluid from transgene (+) line 2 animals contained modest amounts of IL-10 (100–200 pg/ml). Higher levels of IL-10 were noted in BAL fluids from transgene (+) line 5 (400–600 pg/ml), line 6 (1.7–1.9 ng/ml), and line 7 (1.9–2.3 ng/ml) animals (Fig. 1 B). IL-10 was not detected in the BAL fluid from transgene (−) littermate control animals (data not shown). In accord with these findings, mRNA encoding IL-10 was readily detected in RNA from lungs from line 6 and 7 mice, was detected at lower levels in the RNA from line 5 and 2 mice, and was undetectable in pulmonary tissues from transgene (−) animals (data not shown). In addition, transgene-induced IL-10 mRNA was not noted and histologic abnormalities were not appreciated on hematoxylin and eosin analysis of a variety of extrapulmonary tissues from transgene (+) animals (Fig.1 C and data not shown). This demonstrates that the CC10 promoter selectively targeted IL-10 to the lungs of transgene (+) animals. Comparisons were subsequently undertaken of the responses elicited by LPS in transgene (−) and transgene (+) mice. BAL neutrophils were only intermittently detected, and TNF was not detected in BAL from transgene (−) and (+) animals in the absence of LPS administration (data not shown). A profound BAL neutrophilia and impressive levels of BAL TNF were noted 6 h after LPS administration to transgene (−) mice (Fig.2). IL-10 inhibited these responses in an impressive fashion. Transgene (+) line 6 and 7 mice had levels of BAL TNF and neutrophil recovery ∼5–15% of those in transgene (−) littermate controls (Fig. 2) (p < 0.01 for each comparison). Thus, transgenic IL-10 has potent anti-inflammatory effects in the LPS-challenged murine airway. The lungs from transgene (+) and transgene (−) animals were indistinguishable on gross examination, and differences in alveolar size or gross airway morphology were not noted on light microscopic exam (Fig. 3 and data not shown). In contrast to the transgene (−) littermates, however, lungs from transgene (+) mice manifest a mononu"
https://openalex.org/W2078220726,"Liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase I catalyzes the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria. L-CPT I is considered the rate-controlling enzyme in fatty acid oxidation. Expression of the L-CPT I gene is induced by starvation in response to glucagon secretion from the pancreas, an effect mediated by cAMP. Here, the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of L-CPT I gene expression by cAMP were characterized. We demonstrate that the cAMP response unit of the L-CPT I gene is composed of a cAMP-response element motif and a DR1 sequence located 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site. Our data strongly suggest that the coactivator PGC-1 is involved in the regulation of this gene expression by cAMP in combination with HNF4α and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Indeed, (i) cotransfection of CREB or HNF4α dominant negative mutants completely abolishes the effect of cAMP on the L-CPT I promoter, and (ii) the cAMP-responsive unit binds HNF4α and CREB through the DR1 and the cAMP-response element sequences, respectively. Moreover, cotransfection of PGC-1 strongly activates the L-CPT I promoter through HNF4α bound at the DR1 element. Finally, we show that the transcriptional induction of the PGC-1 gene by glucagon through cAMP in hepatocytes precedes that of L-CPT-1. In addition to the key role that PGC-1 plays in glucose homeostasis, it may also be critical for lipid homeostasis. Taken together these observations suggest that PGC-1 acts to coordinate the process of metabolic adaptation in the liver. Liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase I catalyzes the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria. L-CPT I is considered the rate-controlling enzyme in fatty acid oxidation. Expression of the L-CPT I gene is induced by starvation in response to glucagon secretion from the pancreas, an effect mediated by cAMP. Here, the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of L-CPT I gene expression by cAMP were characterized. We demonstrate that the cAMP response unit of the L-CPT I gene is composed of a cAMP-response element motif and a DR1 sequence located 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site. Our data strongly suggest that the coactivator PGC-1 is involved in the regulation of this gene expression by cAMP in combination with HNF4α and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Indeed, (i) cotransfection of CREB or HNF4α dominant negative mutants completely abolishes the effect of cAMP on the L-CPT I promoter, and (ii) the cAMP-responsive unit binds HNF4α and CREB through the DR1 and the cAMP-response element sequences, respectively. Moreover, cotransfection of PGC-1 strongly activates the L-CPT I promoter through HNF4α bound at the DR1 element. Finally, we show that the transcriptional induction of the PGC-1 gene by glucagon through cAMP in hepatocytes precedes that of L-CPT-1. In addition to the key role that PGC-1 plays in glucose homeostasis, it may also be critical for lipid homeostasis. Taken together these observations suggest that PGC-1 acts to coordinate the process of metabolic adaptation in the liver. carnitine palmitoyltransferase liver CPT cAMP response element cAMP-response element binding protein cAMP-response element modulator CAAT/enhancer binding protein protein kinase A CREB-binding protein tyrosine aminotransferase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase cAMP response unit chloramphenicol acetyltransferase electrophoretic mobility shift assays hypersensitive site direct repeat hepatocyte nuclear factor Liver mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis are closely related to the appearance of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)1system. The CPT system, which controls the transfer of long-chain fatty acids inside the mitochondria, is composed of three distinct entities: CPT I localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane, carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase and CPT II localized on the inner mitochondrial membrane (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that CPT I is the rate-limiting enzyme for the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in the liver (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of CPT I have been cloned (2Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Esser V. Brown N.F. Cowan A.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6972-6977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The “liver” isoform (L-CPT I) is expressed in most tissues including liver, kidney, and pancreatic β cells (2Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while the “muscle” isoform (M-CPT I) is expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue (3Esser V. Brown N.F. Cowan A.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6972-6977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Expression of the CPT I gene in liver is regulated during development and by several hormones and nutrients (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). At birth, rat hepatic CPT I mRNA increases, remains high during the suckling period, and then decreases after weaning onto a high carbohydrate diet (5Thumelin S. Esser V. Charvy D. Kolodziej M. Zammit V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Pégorier J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Few studies have addressed the direct effects of pancreatic hormones on the regulation of L-CPT I gene expression. However, it was shown that the addition of glucagon or its second messenger, cyclic AMP, induces transcription of the L-CPT I gene without modification of mRNA half-life (6Louet J.F., Le May C. Pégorier J.P. Decaux J.F. Girard J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 310-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured fetal rat hepatocytes, insulin antagonizes the cAMP-induced accumulation of CPT I mRNA (7Chatelain F. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Pégorier J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a prominent role for pancreatic hormones in the regulation of L-CPT I gene expression.The rat L-CPT I gene has been cloned, and its promoter partially characterized (8Park E.A. Steffen M.L. Song S. Park V.M. Cook G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Basal expression of L-CPT I is driven by Sp1 and NF-Y transcription factors (9Steffen M.L. Harrison W.R. Elder F.F.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Initial characterization of the DNA sequences involved in the hormonal and nutritional response of L-CPT I gene expression allowed the identification of: (i) a functional thyroid hormone (T3)-response element located approximately −3 kb from the transcription start site of the gene (10Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), (ii) a peroxisome proliferator-response element, located at −3 kb from the start site, corresponding to a classical DR1 element (11Louet J.F. Chatelain F. Decaux J.F. Park E.A. Kohl C. Pineau T. Girard J. Pégorier J.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and (iii) a fatty acid-response element present in the first intron of the gene (11Louet J.F. Chatelain F. Decaux J.F. Park E.A. Kohl C. Pineau T. Girard J. Pégorier J.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Cyclic AMP activates eukaryotic gene transcription via binding of nuclear factors to cAMP-responsive elements (CRE). The classical CRE consists of a relatively well conserved 8-bp palindrome (TGACGTCA) (12Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Nuclear factors involved in cAMP-responsive transcriptional activation include cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), cAMP-response element modulator (CREM), activating transcription factor-1 (ATF-1), and potentially, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (13Daniel P.B. Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). CREB proteins belong to a family of transcription factors that contain a basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP). The bZIP family includes Jun, Fos, CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), and yeast GCN4 (13Daniel P.B. Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Current models of cAMP-responsive transcriptional activation invoke phosphorylation of proteins of the CREB family on a single serine residue in response to activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by cAMP. Phosphorylation of CREB promotes the recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and increases cAMP-induced transcription. However, one major limitation of this model is that CREB, ATF-1, and CBP genes are all ubiquitously expressed and are not transcriptionally activated by cAMP (13Daniel P.B. Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, this model cannot explain the sensitivity of liver-specific genes such as tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) to cAMP. In this regard, the cAMP-dependent enhancement of TAT expression is dependent upon the cooperative action of CREB and HNF4α, allowing tissue-specific control of this gene (14Nitsch D. Boshart M. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Similarly, while the promoter of the PEPCK gene contains a classical CRE element, maximal cAMP induction of this gene requires multiple cis-acting sites within a so-called “cAMP response unit” (CRU) (15Roesler W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The CRU of the PEPCK promoter contains five cis-elements including the CRE and four binding sites for a C/EBP (15Roesler W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular mechanisms involved in the cAMP-mediated induction of target genes seem to be more complex than the simple presence of a CRE motif.Recently, PPARγ coactivator-1 (PGC-1) was shown to be involved in the regulation of gluconeogenic genes by cAMP and glucocorticoids (16Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J., Wu, Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). PGC-1 is strongly induced in mouse liver by fasting, insulin deficiency (e.g. streptozotocin-induced diabetes, ob/ob genotype, and liver insulin receptor knockout), and, in primary cultures of hepatocytes, by cAMP (16Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J., Wu, Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase genes are activated by overexpression of PGC-1 (16Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J., Wu, Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Full transcriptional activation of the PEPCK promoter requires a coactivation of the glucocorticoid receptor and HNF4α (16Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J., Wu, Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that PGC-1 could be a key modulator of the metabolic adaptation of the liver.Here, we have characterized a cAMP-responsive unit in the L-CPT I gene. The CRU contains two cis-acting DNA sequences: a CRE and a DR1 motif. We demonstrate that CREB and HNF4α bind to the L-CPT I promoter via the CRE and DR1, respectively. Moreover, we show that the nuclear receptor coactivator PGC-1 strongly stimulates the L-CPT I promoter. In addition, PGC-1 expression is transcriptionally activated by cAMP and glucagon in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. As this induction precedes that of L-CPT I, we suggest that PGC-1 is involved in the activation of the L-CPT I gene by cAMP. Taken together, our results suggest that PGC-1, in addition to controlling gluconeogenesis, also plays a role in the adaptation of hepatic lipid metabolism in response to nutritional stimuli.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimalsFemale Wistar rats bred in our laboratory were housed in plastic cages at a constant temperature, 24 °C, with light between 6.00–20.00 h. They had free access to water and chow pellets (65% carbohydrate, 11% fat, 24% protein by energy content). Livers from 21-day-old fetuses delivered by cesarean section and 1-day-old suckling newborn rats were used for nuclear extract isolation.Isolation and Culture of Suckling Rat Hepatocytes12-day-old suckling pups were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Hepatocytes were isolated by liver perfusion as described previously (17Narkewicz M.R. Iynedjian P.B. Ferré P. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After measurement of cell viability by trypan blue exclusion, hepatocytes were suspended in M199 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5.5 mm glucose, 0,1% (mass/v) bovine serum albumin, and 2% (v/v) Ultroser G (Invitrogen). Cells (2 × 106) were plated in 2 ml of M199 medium in 12-well plates. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After plating for 4 h, the medium containing unattached cells was removed and replaced by 1 ml of fresh M199 without Ultroser G or bovine serum albumin for the transfection experiments.Plasmids ConstructsReporter ConstructsThe reporter plasmids CPT20, CPT18, CPT14, and the CPT15 contain 6870, 4495, 1653, and 193 bp, respectively, of the 5′ flanking sequence from the transcription start site of the L-CPT I gene (8Park E.A. Steffen M.L. Song S. Park V.M. Cook G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A PstI-EcoRI fragment (−3000 to −1653) from the original P1 clone (8Park E.A. Steffen M.L. Song S. Park V.M. Cook G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was ligated into the PstI and EcoRI sites of pBS II K/S+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The SmaI-XhoI fragment from this vector was ligated intoSmaI-XhoI of CPT15 to yield CPT16.L-CPT I (−2967 to −2773) was described previously (11Louet J.F. Chatelain F. Decaux J.F. Park E.A. Kohl C. Pineau T. Girard J. Pégorier J.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Serial deletions of this construct were created by PCR. The 3′ end deletion including L-CPT I (−2967 to −2831) and the L-CPT I (−2967 to −2871) constructs were made with the same forward primer including aHindIII restriction site: (−2967) 5′-TGAAGCTTGGGGTTTGTTATCCTTG-3′ and two different reverse primers containing XbaI restriction sites: (−2831) 5′-CCTCTAGACCTCAGTTCCCCCTGA and (−2871) 5′-CCTCTAGACGTTTTGAGTCAATA-3′. L-CPT I (−2938 to −2831) was generated with the same reverse primer (−2831) and the forward primer (−2938): 5′-CGAAGCTTTCCTCATGGAACCT-3′. These HindIII-XbaI PCR fragments were ligated into the pBLCAT5 vector (18Boshart M. Klüppel M. Schmidt A. Schütz G. Luckow B. Gene. 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Automated DNA sequencing confirmed that the nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was 100% identical to the template sequence. The heterologous construct containing the CRE sequence of the rat somatostatin promoter was described previously (19de Groot R.P. Sassone-Corsi P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2281-2286PubMed Google Scholar).The CRE2x, DR1, CRE, and CRE/DR1 constructs were prepared by ligation of double-stranded oligonucleotides into the HindIII andXbaI sites of the pBLCAT5 vector. Oligonucleotides used for each construct were as follows: CRE2x-upper-5′-AGCTCCTGGTGACGCTGGCCCTGGTGACGCTGGC-3′, CRE2x-lower-5′-CTAGGCCAGCGTCACCAGGGCCAGCGTCACCAGG-3′, DR1-upper-5′-AGCTCTCAAAACGTGTACAGGAGCTCAAAGTTCAAGTTCAAGTTCAGG-3′, DR1-lower-5′-CTAGCCTGAACTTGAACTTTGAGCTCCTGTACACGTTTTGAG-3′, CRE-upper-5′-AGCTGCTGTCCTCATGGAACCTGGTGACGCTGGCTGAACAA-3′, CRE-lower-5′-CTAGTTGTTCAGCCAGCGTCACCAGGTTCCATGAGGACAGC-3′, CRE/DR1-upper-5′-AGCTGGTGACGCTGGCACAGGAGCTCAAAGTTCAAGTTCAGG-3′, and CRE/DR1-lower-5′-CTAGCCTGAACTTGAACTTGAACTTTGAGCTCCTGTGCCAGCGTCACC-3′. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using the DpnI QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides used to disrupt each DNA motif were: CREm-upper-5′-CATGGAACCTGGTaAgcCTGGCTGAAC-3′, AP1m-upper-ACCTCCGCTATTCtCgtAAAACGTGTACAGG-3′, and DR1m-upper-CGTGTACAGGAGCTCAgcGaaCAAGTTCAGGG-3′. Mutation in each construct (CREm, DR1m, AP1m, and CREm-DR1m) was confirmed by sequence analysis.Expression VectorThe expression vector pSV-PKA-Cα codes for the catalytic Cα subunit of PKA (20Gourdon L. Lou D.Q. Raymondjean M. Vasseur-Cognet M. Kahn A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The vector coding for Dn-HNF4α is a selective dominant negative mutant that forms defective heterodimers with wild-type HNF4α, preventing DNA binding and transcriptional activation by HNF4α. It was a gift from T. Leff (21Taylor D.G. Haubenwallner S. Leff T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2930-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The dominant negative mutant Dn-CREB that blocks binding of CREB and closely related transcription factors (such as ATF1) to DNA was a gift from D. Ginty (22Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The expression vectors pSVSport-PGC-1 and VP16-CREB were described previously (16Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J., Wu, Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar).Transient Transfection ProtocolPrimary cultures of rat hepatocytes were transfected as described by Boussif et al. (23Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5575) Google Scholar). To increase transfection efficiency, 200 plaque-forming units/cell of Ad-RSV-nlsLacZ (Rous sarcoma virus promoter driving the nlsLacZ gene) were added simultaneously (24Meunier-Durmort C. Grimal H. Sachs L. Demeneix B. Forest C. Gene Therapy. 1997; 4: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of DNA plasmid per plate and polyethylenimine (0.56 μl of polyethylenimine/μg of DNA) in serum free medium. In some experiments, cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of expression vectors. Transfection was accomplished by dilution of polyethylenimine and plasmid in 25 μl of 150 mm NaCl. They were mixed together, and the polycation/DNA complex was diluted into 1 ml of serum-free medium in 12-well culture dishes. After 7 h of transfection, the medium was changed and Bt2cAMP at 10−4m, glucagon at 10−8m, or vehicle was added for 24 h (luciferase assay) or 48 h (CAT assay). Cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), harvested by scraping, and centrifuged at 8000 g at 4 °C for 5 min. Protein concentration, luciferase, and CAT activities were determined in the supernatant. Luciferase activity was assayed on 20 μl of supernatant using the Promega kit (Promega). CAT activity was assayed as described by Seed and Sheen (25Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene. 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar).Chromatin Structure of the L-CPT I Promoter and Mapping of DNase I Hypersensitive SitesNuclei for chromatin studies were isolated from fresh tissues as described by Schibler et al. (26Schibler U. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Pittet A.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Isolated nuclei were suspended in nuclear storage buffer: 0.3 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 15 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Frozen nuclei were thawed and resuspended at a DNA concentration of 2 mg/ml in digestion buffer containing 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEGTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 15 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Nuclei were prewarmed to 37 °C, and digestions initiated by adding nuclei into tubes containing 5 mm MgCl2 and DNase I (Invitrogen) ranging over 1–8 μg/ml. Control digestion tubes contain MgCl2 but no DNase I. After 15 min of digestion at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of the same volume of a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, 0.3% (mass/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. Nuclei were digested by RNase A (50 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated overnight at 37 °C with proteinase K (100 μg/ml). DNA was extracted and quantified by spectrophotometry.For studies of DNase I hypersensitive sites, DNA from undigested and DNase I from digested nuclei was cut with EcoRI orHindIII (4 units/μg DNA) for 16 h at 37 °C, subjected to electrophoresis, and transferred onto Hybond N+ filter (Amersham Biosciences). For hybridization, two genomic probes were used: a 744-bp EcoRI-SphI fragment localized at −1653 bp from the transcription start site named S1 and an 855-bpHindIII-BamHI fragment located in the first intron named S2. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the multiprime labeling system kit (Amersham Biosciences).Total RNA Extraction and AnalysisTotal RNA was extracted from cultured rat hepatocytes according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar). Total RNA (15 μg) was separated on 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond N membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were hybridized overnight with 32P-labeled cDNA probes. The PEPCK probe was previously described (28Yoo-Warren H.Y. Cimbala M.A. Felz K. Monahan J.E. Leis J.P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10224-10227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L-CPT I and PGC-1 probes were amplified by PCR with the following primers: CPT I-upper-5′-ACCAAGCTGTGGCCTTCCAGTTCACCGTCAC-3′; CPT I-lower-5′-GCGTGGCAGAGACGTCTGGAAGCTGTACAA-3′; PGC-1-upper-5′-TGTATGGAGTGACATAGAGT-3′; and PGC-1-lower-5′-GCTAAGACCGCTGCATTCAT-3′.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)In vitro translated HNF4α was generated using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Recombinant HNF4α and CREB proteins were prepared as described previously (29Viollet B. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4208-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,30Groussin L. Massias J.F. Bertagna X. Bertherat J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts from liver and hepatocytes of rat were prepared with NE-PER kit (Pierce). In vitro translated proteins, recombinant HNF4α, recombinant CREB, or nuclear protein extracts, were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 30,000 cpm of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 14% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 20 μl. In the supershift assay antibodies to HNF4α or CREB were added to the binding reaction. Complexes were separated on a 6% (v/v) native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE running buffer at 200 V for 2 h. For DNA binding competition experiments, excess unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotide was added to the incubation reaction as detailed in the figure legends. Following electrophoresis gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. The sense oligonucleotides used were: 5′-AGTCAAAAGTGTACAGGAGCTCAAAGTTCAAGTTCAG-3′ for L-CPT I-DR1; 5′-AGCTGCTGTCCTCATGGAACCTGGTGACGCTGGCTGAACAA-3′ for L-CPT I-CRE; and 5′-GATCGCCTCCTTGGCTGACGTCAGAGA-3′ for somatostatin-CRE.L-CPT I expression in Liver-specific HNF4α-null Mice (H4LivKO)Liver-specific HNF4α-null mice, in which disruption of a loxP-targeted allele of HNF4α is driven by an albumin-Cre transgene, have been described (31Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). 45-day-old mice were anesthetized with 2.5% avertin and killed by decapitation, and livers were collected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Total liver RNA was prepared as previously described (31Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Poly A+ RNAs were prepared from total liver RNA using the Poly A Tract mRNA kit (Promega). Poly(A)+ RNAs (1 μg) were separated on 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gels prior to blotting to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were hybridized by using successively specific probes of L-CPT I and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (31Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONHormones and neurotransmitters change patterns of gene expression in target cells by activating protein kinases that phosphorylate and modify the activity of different transcription factors (32Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). CREB, the first transcription factor whose activity was shown to be regulated by phosphorylation, mediates the transcriptional effect of cAMP by binding the CRE element in the upstream region of a number of genes (33Rudolph D. Tafuri A. Gass P. Hammerling G.J. Arnold B. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This transcription factor is phosphorylated by PKA after an increase of intracellular cAMP concentration. More recently, it was demonstrated that CREB is an in vivo substrate for a variety of other kinases like the calmodulin kinase, the mitogen-activated protein kinase/p90rsk, the protein kinase C and the protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) (34Mayr B.M. Canettieri G. Montminy M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10936-10941Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This suggests that CREB could activate transcription of genes in response to various other extracellular signals such as Ca2+ or growth factors (35Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 36Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E.

Thus, the molecular mechanisms mediating the cAMP signal and its specificity are more complex than previously thought.In the present study, we have examined the regulation of L-CPT I gene expression by cAMP in hepatocytes. Our results show that two cis-acting elements, a DR1 motif and a CRE-like element (TGACG), are required for the full stimulatory effect of cAMP on L-CPT I expression. This type of “multi-responsive element” structure, termed CRU, is not a surprising observation. Indeed, it is now generally accepted that transcriptional regulation of genes by cAMP seldom occurs through a unique CRE motif as described for the somatostatin gene (38Montminy M. Brindle P. Arias J. Ferreri K. Armstrong R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For example, the full cAMP induction of glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression involves two CRE elements in HepG2 cell lines (39Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14096-14106Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 40Schmoll D. Wasner C. Hinds C.J. Allan B.B. Walther R. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), while in kidney cell lines, the same gene is regulated by cAMP through these two CRE sequences and an HNF1 motif (41Streeper R.S. Hornbuckle L.A. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Oeser J.K. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19111-19118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the CRU of the TAT gene, which like L-CPT I, is induced by glucagon and repressed by insulin, is composed of a CRE and a DR1 motif (14Nitsch D. Boshart M. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5479-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The L-CPT I gene contains four consensus CRE sites, from CRE1 to CRE4 (6Louet J.F., Le May C. Pégorier J.P. Decaux J.F. Girard J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 310-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the classical, symmetric CRE1 (TGACGTAA), which differs from the well characterized CRE sequence of the rat somatostatin gene (TGACGTCA) by only one nucleotide, is not sufficient for the response to cAMP. These data strongly suggest that the presence of CRE consensus sequences within the promoter of genes is not sufficient to fully explain cAMP gene activation. Our study shows that the functionality of a CRE sequence is more dependent on its promoter context (proximity to other cis-acting element(s), localization in an open chromatin structure"

In this report we asked whether methylation participates in controlling changes in Oct-3/4 expression and thus may play an important role in controlling normal embryogenesis. We show that the Oct-3/4 gene is unmethylated from the blastula stage but undergoes de novomethylation at 6.5 days post-coitum and remains modified in all adult somatic tissues analyzed. Oct-3/4 remains unmethylated in 6.25 days post-coitum epiblast cells when other genes, such as apoAI, undergo de novo methylation. We show that methylation of the Oct-3/4 promoter sequence strongly compromises its ability to direct efficient transcription. Moreover, DNA methylation inhibits basal transcription of the endogenous Oct-3/4 gene in vivo. We found that the Oct-3/4 gene harbors a cis-specific demodification element that includes the proximal enhancer sequence. This element leads to demethylation in embryonal carcinoma cells when the sequence is initially methylated and protects the local region from de novo methylation in post-implantation embryos. These results indicate that in the embryo protection from de novo methylation is not a unique feature of imprinted or housekeeping genes that carry a CpG island, but is also applicable to tissue-specific genes expressed during early stages of embryogenesis. Methylation of Oct-3/4 may be analogous to methylation of CpG islands on the inactive X chromosome that also occurs at later stages of development.

Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The Oct-3/4gene is a member of the POU family of transcription factors; it is expressed in embryonal stem (ES)1 and in embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells (1Scholer H.R.

Biol. 1994; 166: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Oct-3/4 protein is present in unfertilized oocytes, and the zygotic expression is activated prior to the 8-cell stage (9Palmieri S.L. Peter W. Hess H. Scholer H.R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 10Pesce M. Wang X. Wolgemuth D.J. Scholer H. Mech.

In the embryo Oct-3/4 is abundantly and uniformly expressed in all cells through the morula stage (11Yeom Y.I., Ha, H.S. Balling R. Scholer H.R. Artzt K. Mech. Dev. 1991; 35: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Its expression is down-regulated in trophectoderm cells and becomes restricted to cells of the inner cell mass in the blastocyst (9Palmieri S.L. Peter W. Hess H. Scholer H.R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Oct-3/4 expression is high and persists through day 7.5 in the unsegmented presomitic mesoderm, decreasing anteriorly to posteriorly as the somatic lineages form (7Scholer H.R. Dressler G.R. Balling R. Rohdewohld H. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). From day 8.5, expression cannot be detected in any somatic tissue but is restricted to the premigratory progenitor germ cells (9Palmieri S.L. Peter W. Hess H. Scholer H.R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 12Yeom Y.I. Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Scholer H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, using conventional gene targeting technology, it was found that the activity of Oct-3/4 is essential for the identity of the pluripotential founder cell population in the inner cell mass (13Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe Nebenius D. Chambers I. Scholer H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2627) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that a critical amount of Oct-3/4 is required to sustain stem cell self-renewal, and any up- or down-regulation induces divergent developmental programs (14Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). A very modest modulation of Oct-3/4 levels in ES cells results in a dramatic readout. Thus, it is now recognized that the mere presence of Oct-3/4 protein does not define pluripotency because it is the level of expression that is the key to regulation. One of the molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression is methylation (15Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5254) Google Scholar). DNA methylation plays a crucial role in normal embryogenesis by acting in cis to modulate protein-DNA interactions. Several studies have demonstrated that DNA methylation patterns go through dynamic changes during embryogenesis. A global loss of DNA methylation occurs in the mammalian preimplantation embryo prior to the 16-cell morula stage, and the DNA remains unmethylated throughout blastulation (16Kafri T. Ariel M. Brandeis M. Shemer R. Urven L. McCarrey J. Cedar H. Razin A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 17Monk M. Boubelik M. Lehnert S. Development. 1987; 99: 371-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following implantation, an extensive wave of de novo methylation occurs, and only genes containing CpG islands, such as housekeeping genes, escape this process (16Kafri T. Ariel M. Brandeis M. Shemer R. Urven L. McCarrey J. Cedar H. Razin A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 18Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 19Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). At a later stage of development, tissue-specific genes undergo selective demethylation (20Lichtenstein M. Keini G. Cedar H. Bergman Y. Cell. 1994; 76: 913-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 21Mostoslavsky R. Bergman Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F29-F50PubMed Google Scholar). Because Oct-3/4 plays a crucial role in regulating initial differentiation decisions in early development and has a unique expression pattern, we studied the dynamics of the generation of its methylation pattern and the role of methylation in controllingOct-3/4 expression. We have shown previously (22Ben Shushan E. Pikarsky E. Klar A. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that treatment of EC cells with RA reducesOct-3/4 expression that is associated with increased methylation and changes in chromatin structure in the immediate upstream regulatory region that includes the promoter (P) and proximal enhancer (PE) elements. In this study we show that in vivo the Oct-3/4 gene is unmethylated from the blastula stage and starts to undergo de novo methylation at 6.5 dpc. The Oct-3/4 gene remains modified in all adult somatic organs analyzed. We show that during embryogenesisOct-3/4 remains unmethylated at a time when genome wide methylation occurs; thus it was interesting to find out whether it carries a cis-demethylation element that protects the gene from global modification mechanisms. By using a series of stable transfection assays into EC cells, we have found that the Oct-3/4 gene does harbor acis-specific demodification element that includes theOct-3/4 PE sequence. Furthermore, mutagenesis at the protein-binding sites of this sequence clearly affected its demethylation activity. By using a mini-transgene containing the PE sequences only, we have shown that in the embryo the PE protects the DNA from de novo methylation in 6.25 dpc epiblast cells, and when it is mutated the sequence becomes methylated. In vitromethylation of the Oct-3/4 upstream sequence inhibits its ability to induce transcription. Moreover, we have shown that DNA methylation inhibits the endogenousOct-3/4 basal expression in vivo. Murine P19 (23McBurney M.W. Rogers B.J. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) EC cells and L8 cells were maintained as described previously (8Pikarsky E. Sharir H. Ben Shushan E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1026-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). p53−/− and p53−/− Dnmt1−/− fibroblasts were grown from 9 dpc embryos obtained by mating p53−/−Dnmt1−/+ mice. These cells (grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 15% fetal calf serum) appear to be immortal, still not having undergone senescence even after 100 passages. Nearest neighbor analysis (24Naveh-Many T. Cedar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) revealed that less than 5% of CpG residues in these cells are methylated, as compared with 73% for normal fibroblasts. These cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TSA for 24 h in order to study Oct-3/4 transcription. The constructs 342 and pOct-luc have been described previously (see Refs. 25Siegfried Z. Eden S. Mendelsohn M. Feng X. Tsuberi B.Z. Cedar H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar and 26Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, respectively). pOctPE-luc was constructed by cloning the PCR amplification product spanning positions −1215 to +155 of theOct-3/4 upstream region containing the PE and P sequences into the PstI site of pOct-luc. The pre-existing P was deleted by digestion with HindIII- and the plasmid was religated. The primers used were Nsi 2 and Nsi 3. The following plasmids were constructed by digesting the different constructs with NsiI and subcloning them into thePstI site in plasmid 342. pPEwt was constructed by cloning the PCR amplification product spanning positions −1215 to −900 of the Oct-3/4 PE region. The primers used were Nsi 2 and Nsi 1. pPEPwt was constructed by cloning the PCR amplification product spanning the −1215 to +155 positions of theOct-3/4 PE and P region. The primers used were Nsi 2 and Nsi 3. pPE1A* construct is identical to the above described pPEwt plasmid except for a 16-bp mutation inserted in the 1A site. Two distinct PCR amplification reactions were done on pBluescript KS(−) containing the −1215 to −541 BamHI-SauIIIA upstream region of the Oct-3/4 gene. The primers used were RARE1A and Primer 2 and RARE1Arev and Primer 1. Products were mixed, amplified with Primers 1 and 2, digested withBamHI/ScaI, and subcloned intoBamHI/EcoRV sites in pBluescript KS(−) to create pmRARE1A. pPE1A* was constructed by cloning the PCR amplification product of pmRARE1A using the primers Nsi 1 and Nsi 2 into thePstI site in 342. pPE1B* was constructed by cloning the PCR amplification product spanning positions −1215 to −942 of the Oct-3/4 PE region, harboring a deletion of the 1B site. The primers used were Nsi 2 and Nsi 4. pPE1A*1B* construct is identical to the above described pPE1B* plasmid except for a 16-bp mutation inserted in the 1A site. pPE1A*1B* was constructed by cloning the PCR amplification product of pmRARE1A using the primers Nsi 2 and Nsi 4. pPEP1A*1B* construct is identical to the above described pPEPwt plasmid except for a 16-bp mutation inserted in the 1A site and a 28-bp deletion of the 1B site. pmRARE1A was subjected to PCR amplification with Primer 2 and Primer RARE1Brev; the product was digested withBamHI/ScaI and ligated toScaI/BamHI fragment from pPEPwt. The ligation fragment was subjected to PCR amplification using the primers Nsi 2 and Nsi 3 and subcloned into the PstI site in 342 to create pPEP1A*1B*.

Cells (5 × 105) were plated 24 h before transfection and cotransfected with 15 μg of methylated plasmid together with 1.5 μg of a plasmid carrying the neoselection gene. Stably transfected cells were selected by G418 (250 mg per ml, Invitrogen), and clonally propagated. Pre-implantation embryos were obtained as described previously (29Birger Y. Shemer R. Perk J.

The post-implantation embryos were dissected from the uterus of the foster mothers at dpc 6.25, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 12.5, or 14.5. Genomic DNAs were extracted from the following groups: 1) a pool of 10–20 preimplantation blastocysts; 2) a pool of epiblast cells dissected from 7 embryos of 6.25 dpc; 3) pools of post-implantation embryos at stages 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 12.5, and 14.5 dpc. DNA samples were divided into 3 aliquots that were subjected to digestion with PvuII alone and PvuII together with HpaII or HhaI. The PCRs were carried out with 5 ng of DNA using the following primers: for analyzingHpaII sites 1–4 primers Hp1a and Hp1b, Hp2a and Hp2b, Hp3a and Hp3b, Hp4a and Hp4b were used, respectively. In order to analyze the HhaI site, primers Hp3a and Hp4b were used. To assay the Jκ region that lacks HpaII or HhaI sites, we used 5GL-2 and Jκ1110 primers.

Luciferase activity was determined 48 h post-transfection (Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay system kit, Promega) and was corrected for transfection efficiency by measuring the Renilla luciferase activity. Total RNA was collected from the cells with Trizol (Sigma) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was carried out following the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). RT-PCR analysis of Oct-3/4 transcription in p53−/−, p53−/−/Dnmt1−/−, and blastocyst cells were carried out using the primers 251L and Oct4-a. PCR was performed using 200 mm of the four dNTPs, 100 ng of each primer, and 0.1 μl of [32P]dCTP. A second half-nested PCR was carried out in the same reaction conditions using the following primers: Oct4–5′ and Oct4-a.

DNA from the wt and mutated pools of embryos was extracted, and 10 ng were subjected to digestion with PvuII in the presence or absence of HpaII. Products were analyzed by PCR amplification using primers DraI-3′ and Hp1b (Table II) flankingHpaII site 1 in the Oct-3/4 PE. As a control, we assayed the Jκ region that lacks HpaII sites using 5GL-2 and Jκ1110 primers. Primers and PCR amplification conditions are described in Table II. Four HpaII and oneHhaI sites were analyzed in theOct-3/4 1370-bp upstream region (Fig.1A). To study the methylation status of the Oct-3/4 gene in early mouse embryos, genomic DNA was isolated from mouse embryos at various stages of development. We adopted a PCR-based assay in which genomic DNA was subjected to digestion with or without HpaII orHhaI methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes. Digestion conditions were carefully titrated. After digestion, oligonucleotide primers flanking each site were used. A PCR product is observed only when the site is methylated and refractory to digestion. It was shown previously (16Kafri T. Ariel M. Brandeis M. Shemer R. Urven L. McCarrey J. Cedar H. Razin A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) that when properly calibrated, this assay is linear over a wide range of DNA concentrations and can be used to measure accurately the degree of DNA methylation at specific sites. By using this PCR assay, we show that the HhaI and the fourHpaII sites tested are clearly unmethylated in blastocysts and in epiblast cells isolated from 6.25 dpc embryos. These sites become methylated in 6.5 dpc embryos almost to the full extent (Fig.1B). Control experiments were included to validate our results. Tail DNA and DNA from P19 cells served as controls for methylated and unmethylated DNA, respectively. Moreover, as an internal control, a primer pair that amplifies a Jκ sequence that does not encompass either HpaII or HhaI sites was included in each reaction. As expected, the fragment was amplified from all DNA samples to a similar level (Fig. 1B). We have quantified the methylation status of each site by PhosphorImager analysis and found that different sites undergo modification to various levels, and for most of these sites the level of methylation is sustained throughout embryogenesis (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained from quantifications of Southern blots containing DNA isolated from 6.5, 8.5, 12.5, and 14.5 dpc embryos, P19 cells, and murine tails (data not shown). In order to investigate whether this pattern of modification serves as the prototype for the basic stable methylation pattern in somatic cells, we analyzed the methylation status of theOct-3/4 upstream regulatory region in adult kidney and tail DNA. As can be seen in Fig. 1D, the cleavage patterns of all sites analyzed of both DNA samples were roughly similar to those found in 8.5-day embryos. Results from PhosphorImager analysis of the corresponding Southern blots were graphed (Fig. 1E), and it is interesting to note that the HhaI site located in the P region and the juxtaposed HpaII site 3 are almost fully methylated, serving as a core methylation center, whereas sites flanking this center (HpaII sites 1, 2, and 4) are partially methylated. These experiments clearly show that the methylation pattern established during development faithfully propagates itself to adulthood. The apoA1 gene, similar to other tissue-specific genes analyzed, undergoes de novo methylation due to the onset of global methylation that occurs at post-implantation embryos (16Kafri T. Ariel M. Brandeis M. Shemer R. Urven L. McCarrey J. Cedar H. Razin A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 17Monk M. Boubelik M. Lehnert S. Development. 1987; 99: 371-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1C, the apoA1 sequences are methylated in the 6.25 dpc epiblast cells, at the time whenOct-3/4 is still unmethylated. Thus, theOct-3/4 gene remains unmethylated at a time when the apoA1 gene undergoes de novo methylation. One possible mechanism to explain the ability of the Oct-3/4gene to escape the first de novo methylation wave is the involvement of a cis-element that either actively demethylates the newly methylated Oct-3/4 or protects it from de novo methylation. At this stage of our research we cannot differentiate between these two alternatives, and for simplicity reasons this element will be designated a protection/demethylation or demodification element. In the first series of experiments we wished to determine whether a long (1370 bp) fragment from the upstream regulatory element of theOct-3/4 gene could bring about demethylation of an in vitro methylated substrate when integrated into the genome of P19 EC cells. This element contains the P, intervening, and PE sequences. We inserted this fragment into a vector (25Siegfried Z. Eden S. Mendelsohn M. Feng X. Tsuberi B.Z. Cedar H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) that was engineered to harbor a non-CpG island sequence as well as recognition sites for methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases (designated pPEPwt, Figs. 1A and2A). We generated stably transfected cell lines containing the above described in vitro methylated (by HpaII and HhaI methylases) construct and examined the methylation status of the insert as well as the vector sequences. To minimize the effect of particular integration sites and copy number, we analyzed more than 10 independent clones for each of the constructs tested and chose those with a similar copy number. The sites that were analyzed were the same HpaII and HhaI sites that were analyzed in the endogenous Oct-3/4 gene (Fig. 1) and an extra HhaI site in the vector sequence (Fig.2A). All sites analyzed were undermethylated (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that this fragment harbors a demodification element that is able to demethylate sequences inside and outside the fragment. Next we analyzed the ability of the P alone, the proximal enhancer (PE) alone, and the P and PE elements without the intervening sequences to induce demethylation. It was clear that both the P and the intervening sequences are dispensable for the demethylation process (data not shown). In striking contrast, we found that the PE fragment (pPEwt) plays a key role in directing the demethylation reaction (Fig.2B, compare lanes 4 and 5). This PE was previously found to be a critical element for P19 EC cell-specific expression and for RA-mediated down-regulation of the Oct-3/4 protein (1Scholer H.R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 2Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether the Oct-3/4demodification element is specific for EC cells or alternatively functions in other cells as well. We transfected in vitromethylated pPEwt into L8 fibroblast cells and performed Southern blot analysis. This analysis showed that the integrated construct was resistant to HpaII and HhaI digestion and therefore maintained methylation at these sites (Fig. 2C, compare lane 1to lanes 3and 4). Taken together, these experiments clearly indicate that theOct-3/4 PE is required for directing demodification and for mediating demethylation of theOct-3/4 gene in a cell-specific manner. This cell specificity encouraged us to delineate the demodification element responsible for Oct-3/4 demethylation in EC cells. It was shown previously (3Minucci S. Botquin V. Yeom Y."
https://openalex.org/W2003766273,"Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires many proteins that interact with one another and with replicators. Using a yeast genetic screen, we have identified Noc3p (nucleolar complex-associated protein) as a novel replication-initiation protein. Noc3p interacts with MCM proteins and ORC and binds to chromatin and replicators throughout the cell cycle. It functions as a critical link between ORC and other initiation proteins to effect chromatin association of Cdc6p and MCM proteins for the establishment and maintenance of prereplication complexes. Noc3p is highly conserved in eukaryotes and is the first identified bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) protein required for replication initiation. As Noc3p is also required for pre-rRNA processing, Noc3p is a multifunctional protein that plays essential roles in two vital cellular processes."

Although the existence of a murine counterpart of hCLCA2 has been suspected by the positive immunohistochemical staining of endothelia of mouse pulmonary blood vessels with anti-bCLCA2 mAb6D3 and by the anti-metastatic effect of mAb6D3 (5Zhu D.Z.

We report now the isolation and cloning of this molecule, which establish identity with the previously cloned mCLCA1 (15Gandhi R. Elble R.C. Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D., Ji, H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U.

Intrigued by studies in a novel pulmonary metastasis model that allowed the in situ tracking of blood-borne cancer cells in perfused rodent lungs and the finding that lung metastases arose exclusively from endothelial cell-bound tumor cells by intravascular growth (16Al Mehdi A.B. Tozawa K. Fisher A.B. Shientag L. Lee A. Muschel R.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), we then explored whether the β4-mCLCA1 adhesion by activating distinct, growth-promoting signaling pathways could account for the observed intravascular tumor cell proliferation. Our effort was focused on three signaling targets that may operate immediately downstream of the establishment of focal adhesions and promote cell growth. These targets were focal adhesion kinase (FAK), proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2 (Pyk2), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (reviewed in Refs. 17Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Mol.

Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We found that β4 integrin ligation to mCLCA1 selectively caused complexing with and activation of FAK that did not require participation of the Met oncogene (20Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Downstream of FAK the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was activated to promote tumor cell proliferation on surfaces coated with recombinant mCLCA1 and on bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) that constitutively express bCLCA2 protein (5Zhu D.Z. Cheng C.F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). FAK/ERK signaling was abrogated by β4-mCLCA1 adhesion-blocking antibodies and by transfection of B16-F10 with dominant-negative (dn)-FAK mutants. These dn-FAK mutants also suppressed the metastatic growth of B16-F10 cells by down-regulating intravascular tumor cell proliferation, showing for the first time that FAK signaling initiated by tumor cell β4 integrin ligation to its novel endothelial cell mCLCA1adhesion partner is critical during the initial steps of metastasis formation.

Precleared supernatants were mixed with anti-Myc mAb9E10 and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were then added to the reaction mixture and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed extensively with cold TBS lysis buffer (0.5% OG) and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, using streptavidin-HRP and anti-β4 pAb1922. Cultures of B16-F10 and mCLCA1-transfected HEK293 cells served as controls. Pull-down assays were performed essentially as described by Puzon-McLaughlin and Takada (27Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, β4 integrin immunopurified from B16-F10 or HEK293 cells co-transfected with the α6 and β4 integrin subunits was immobilized on Protein G-Sepharose beads conjugated with anti-β4 pAb1922 (3Abdel-Ghany M.

Beads with bound β4integrin were washed extensively with lysis buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5%, instead of 1% OG (washing buffer), then incubated overnight at 4 °C with mCLCA1 immunopurified from HEK293 cells transfected with mCLCA1-Myc or lysates from surface-biotinylated BAEC, which constitutively express bCLCA2 (both CLCA preparations in TBS lysis buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2 at a final detergent concentration of 0.5% OG) (3Abdel-Ghany M.

Conversely, beads conjugated with anti-Myc mAb9E10 and bound mCLCA1-Myc were used to pull-down the β4integrin from lysates of HEK293 cells co-transfected with the α6 and β4 integrin subunits or surface-biotinylated B16-F10 cells (both cell lysates prepared in the same 0.5% OG-containing buffer as above). For detection of bound protein, beads were washed extensively with washing buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and bound material was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The glutamate receptor subunit GluR3, a multimembrane-spanning channel protein with similar hydrophobicity characteristics as CLCA proteins was used as negative control (21Carson N.G. Gahring L.C.

Wild-type (wt) mCLCA1 protein was purified by mAb6D3-immunaffinity chromatography from lung extracts, following surface biotinylation of pulmonary endothelia by in situ perfusion of mice via the right heart ventricle (28Cheng H.-C.

Recombinant Myc-tagged mCLCA1 was prepared from extracts of HEK293 transfected with mCLCA1-Myc, using mAb9E10 (3Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol.

Serum-starved tumor cells were removed from the growth surface with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, washed thrice in DMEM containing 1% BSA, and immediately seeded into 35-mm dishes (1 × 106cells/dish) previously coated with either mCLCA1 (∼3 μg/ml) or poly-l-lysine (PLL, 1 mg/ml) and blocked with 2% BSA in PBS. Dishes coated with EHS laminin and placental laminin (both 20 μg/ml) served as control substrates for the β4 integrin (3Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25438-25446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). B16-F10 cells were incubated for various periods of time, and bound tumor cells were lysed in modified TBS lysis buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-β4, anti-FAK, anti-Met, anti-Src, and anti-Grb2 antibodies (3Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25438-25446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE (7–12% polyacrylamide), blotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-β4, anti-FAK, anti-Src, anti-Grb2, as well as anti-pY antibodies. The ERK activity was determined from lysates of B16-F10 transfectants bound to mCLCA1- or PLL-coated dishes (see above) using anti-ERK antibody-conjugated agarose beads, followed by in vitrokinase assay (29Mainiero F. Pepe A. Wary K.K. Spinardi L. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4470-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In brief, the kinase reaction was initiated by adding to the beads 25 μl of kinase buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm cold ATP, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA) and 2.5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP). After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, samples were boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE, and pMBP was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by Cerenkov counting. The BrdUrd assay was performed by a modification of the procedure by Brunet et al. (30Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouysseágur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In brief, the day after co-transfection with GFP and either wtFAK, FRNK, FAKY397F, or vector (mock), B16-F10 cells were serum-starved for 24 h, then seeded into wells (1 × 104 cells/well) of Costar 96-well assay plates (Corning, Corning, NY) coated with either mCLCA1 (3 μg/ml), fibronectin (5 μg/ml), or PLL (20 μg/ml) in the presence of DMEM containing 0.5% bovine calf serum and 100 μm 5-BrdUrd. After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed with DMEM, and the plates were mounted on the stage of an Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope. Using a 40× objective, 20 fields (5/well) were recorded for each transfectant carefully registering the stage coordinates for each field. Cells were then fixed with methanol:formaldehyde (99:1, v/v) for 15 min at −20 °C followed by 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After rinses in PBS, chromatin was rendered accessible by a 10-min treatment with 2 m HCl, completely abolishing the GFP fluorescence. Cells were thoroughly washed with PBS, blocked with PBS/1% BSA/goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100) for 30 min at 37 °C, then incubated with anti-BrdUrd mAb (1:100) in PBS/1% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. The secondary antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500 in PBS/1% BSA, 30 min, 37 °C) (ICN). The fields recorded for GFP(+) cells were then rephotographed, and cells were scored for anti-BrdUrd staining. The percent BrdUrd(+) cells per GFP(+) cells was determined (a minimum of 200–300 green cells were evaluated per transfectant). Serum-starved B16-F10 cells co-transfected with GFP and wtFAK, FRNK, FAKY397F, or vector alone were seeded at a concentration of 200 green fluorescent cells/well into 96-well microtitration plates (Corning) coated with mCLCA1 (∼3 μg/ml, overnight, 4 °C). The mean number of green fluorescent cells was counted 48 h after seeding (96 h after transfection) for each transfectant and expressed as the percentage of GFP(+)cells in mock transfected B16-F10 cells. For tumor cell growth on endothelial cell monolayers, lung matrix-modulated BAEC (5 × 104/cm2) (5Zhu D.Z. Cheng C.F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1988; 58: 379-387PubMed Google Scholar) were seeded into 48-well plates and grown to confluence, then seeded with 3 × 103 B16-F10 cells co-transfected with GFP/wtFAK or GFP/FRNK. Tumor cells were incubated on the BAEC monolayers in DMEM + 1% FBS for 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h at 37 °C. Ten random areas (100×) were photographed daily for each transfectant, the number of GFP(+) cells per field was counted, and the counts were averaged. Adhesion and lung colony assays were performed as described previously (3Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25438-25446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Zhu D.Z. Cheng C.F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine the effects of wt and mutant FAK on the lung colony efficiency, B16-F10 were injected into the lateral tail vein of 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (eight mice/experiment) 48 h after transient transfection with FRNK, FAKY397F, or vector alone. Mice were sacrificed 21 days after tumor cell injection. Median and range of the number of lung colonies and mean ± S.D. of the lung weights were determined for each transfectant. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that intravenous co-injection of the anti-bCLCA2 (Lu-ECAM-1) mAb6D3 and [125I]iododeoxyuridine-labeled B16-F10 cells into syngeneic mice caused an almost complete clearance of tumor cells from mouse lungs within 3–5 days and a concomitant dramatic reduction in the number of lung metastases (6Zhu D. Cheng C.F. Pauli B.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig.1A). In contrast, co-injection with mIgG resulted in incomplete tumor cell clearance and large numbers of metastases (Fig. 1A). These observations strongly suggested that mouse pulmonary endothelia express a CLCA family member that facilitates lung colonization by B16-F10 cells. To explore this possibility, we performed RT-PCR on RNA isolated from mouse lungs and cultured mouse pulmonary endothelial cells using degenerate primers based on the bCLCA2 amino acid sequence. A 414-bp PCR product was amplified from these sources in addition to RNA from mouse aortic endothelial cells, but not B16-F10 and HEK293 cells (Fig.1B). Sequencing of individual PCR products revealed 100% identity with the previously cloned mCLCA1 (15Gandhi R. Elble R.C. Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D., Ji, H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. J. Biol.

The mCLCA1 protein products were subsequently isolated from extracts of mouse lungs, whose endothelia had been surface-biotinylated by in situ vascular perfusion and identified by Western blotting using streptavidin-HRP and anti-bCLCA2 pAb(rat4), respectively (Fig. 1C). Protein processing of wt mCLCA1 was identical to that of recombinant mCLCA1 extracted and immunopurified from mCLCA1-transfected HEK293 cells, yielding a 125-kDa precursor protein and 90- and 35-kDa proteolytic processing products (15Gandhi R.

Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of RAD2, the S. cerevisiae counterpart of XPG, in promoting efficient RNA polymerase II transcription. Inactivation of RAD26, the S. cerevisiae counterpart of the human CSB gene, also causes a deficiency in transcription, and a synergistic decline in transcription occurs in the absence of both the RAD2 and RAD26 genes. Growth is also retarded in the rad2Δ and rad26Δ single mutant strains, and a very severe growth inhibition is seen in the rad2Δ rad26Δ double mutant. From these and other observations presented here, we suggest that transcriptional defects are the underlying cause of CS."

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Overexcitation of chlorophyll (Chl)1 and overreduction of the electron transport chain can result in increased generation of reactive intermediates and harmful byproducts of photosynthesis. For example, when excitation energy in singlet-excited Chl (1Chl*) cannot be used to drive electron transport, the lifetime of 1Chl* increases, resulting in an increased yield of triplet-excited Chl (3Chl*) via intersystem crossing. 3Chl* can generate singlet O2(1O2*), which can directly damage pigments, proteins, and lipids in the photosynthetic apparatus. To maintain a short lifetime of 1Chl* and minimize photo-oxidative damage, a nonphotochemical quenching process, called qE, is induced in excessive light, resulting in de-excitation of 1Chl* molecules and thermal dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in the light-harvesting antenna of photosystem (PS) II (2Bjo¨rkman O. Demmig-Adams B. Schulze E.-D. Caldwell M.M. Ecophysiology of Photosynthesis. Springer, Berlin1994: 17-47Google Scholar, 3Govindjee Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 22: 131-160Crossref Google Scholar). Because it decreases the lifetime of 1Chl*, qE can be measured easily as a decrease in the maximum yield of Chl fluorescence in isolated chloroplast membranes, algal cells, or intact leaves. qE is induced by a low pH in the thylakoid lumen of chloroplasts during illumination with excessive light (reviewed in Refs. 2Bjo¨rkman O.

Low pH activates the violaxanthin de-epoxidase, which converts violaxanthin, V, into antheraxanthin, A, and then zeaxanthin, Z, as part of a xanthophyll cycle (6Eskling M. Arvidsson P.-O.

Binding of de-epoxidized xanthophylls (A and Z) and protons (H+) to undefined PSII proteins is hypothesized to result in a conformational change that effectively switches a PSII unit into a quenched state in which nonphotochemical de-excitation of 1Chl* is favored (reviewed in Refs. 10Demmig-Adams B. Gilmore A.M. Adams III., W.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar and11Gilmore A.M. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 99: 197-209Crossref Google Scholar). The decrease in the maximum yield of Chl fluorescence caused by qE is associated with characteristic changes in Chl fluorescence lifetime distributions that can be described by a three-state model for PSII (12Gilmore A.M. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2273-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Gilmore A.M. Shinkarev V.P. Hazlett T.L.

According to this model, without lumen acidification and with PSII traps closed, the main Chl fluorescence lifetime distribution that is broad and centered at ∼1.7–2.2 ns is referred to as the W state. Thylakoid membrane energization by a ΔpH results in a distinct conversion of the W state distribution to a shorter, usually narrower lifetime, centered at ∼1.6–1.8 ns and referred to as the X state. The W to X shift is hypothesized to be related to protein conformational changes (15Alcala J.R. Gratton E. Prendergrast F.G. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 587-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) in the molecular environment of the protein-bound fluorophores, in this case fluorescing Chls (12Gilmore A.M.

The conformational changes are associated with the activation for potential structural interactions between the xanthophylls Z and A and the PSII proteins. The final step in the model is the binding of Z (or A) to convert PSII from the X state to the Y state that exhibits a short lifetime distribution typically at ∼0.3–0.5 ns (Y state) (12Gilmore A.M.

The W to X to Y state conversion is typically saturated by levels of Z or A above 2–3 molecules per PSII (12Gilmore A.M. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hence, it was concluded that the energy dissipation in PSII exhibited saturable kinetics and may be defined by a pH-dependent binding isotherm (13Gilmore A.M. Shinkarev V.P. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). According to this model, and as tested in the experiments below, the energy dissipation mechanism should therefore exhibit limiting (and potentially saturating) characteristics for both the available xanthophyll substrate concentration [A+Z] and the xanthophyll binding enzyme concentration. Characterization of mutants that are defective in qE has helped to define the factors that are required for the photoprotective mechanism (1Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Green B.R. Vlahakis S. Yocum C.F. Pichersky E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Wedel N. Klein R. Ljungberg U. Andersson B. Herrmann R.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PsbS has been reported to bind substoichiometric levels of V (30Funk C. Schro¨der W.P. Napiwotzki A. Tjus S.E. Renger G. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11133-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), although recent attempts to purify or reconstitute the protein with bound pigments were unsuccessful (31Dominici P. Caffarri S. Armenante F. Ceoldo S. Crimi M. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22750-22758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In thenpq4-1 mutant of Arabidopsis, the nuclear gene encoding PsbS has been completely deleted, resulting in the absence of PsbS protein and a severe defect in qE (21Li X.-P. Bjo¨rkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). In contrast to other mutants in which the accumulation of de-epoxidized xanthophylls is affected, the npq4-1 mutant exhibits xanthophyll cycle conversion and generation of the thylakoid ΔpH that are indistinguishable from that of the wild type. Loss-of-function mutations like the npq4-1 deletion usually behave as recessive mutations in genetic crosses, yet npq4-1 is semidominant: heterozygous F1 plants resulting from a cross betweennpq4-1 and the wild type have a phenotype that is intermediate between those of the parents. This observation suggested that the dosage of the psbS gene somehow affects the level of qE (21Li X.-P. Bjo¨rkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). In this study, the effect of psbS gene dosage was investigated systematically by comparing psbS mRNA levels, PsbS protein levels, extent of qE, and global analysis of the PSII Chl fluorescence lifetime distributions. Materials in the investigation included the homozygous npq4-1mutant plants (no psbS gene copies), heterozygous F1 plants (one psbS gene copy), and homozygous wild-type plants (twopsbS gene copies). The targeted global analysis employed the measured xanthophyll concentrations, lumen pH, and multifrequency phase and modulation data to simulate the changes in the fractional intensity changes in the PSII components corresponding to the W, X, and Y states (13Gilmore A.M. Shinkarev V.P. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15Alcala J.R. Gratton E. Prendergrast F.G. Biophys.

The implications of the results for the concentration-dependent function of the PsbS protein in the pH- and xanthophyll-dependent control of qE are discussed. A. thalianaplants (Col-0 background) were grown in a growth chamber with a short-day photoperiod of 10 h light (150 μmol photons m−2 s−1, 22–23 °C) and 14 h dark (19–20 °C). Plants between the ages of 5 and 7 weeks, prior to bolting, were used for all experiments except for genomic DNA extraction and crosses. Heterozygous plants (npq4-1/NPQ4; hereafter referred to as F1) were generated by crossing wild-type plants (NPQ4/NPQ4) with homozygous npq4-1 mutant plants (npq4-1/npq4-1; hereafter referred to asnpq4-1). Wild-type plants have two copies of thepsbS gene, the F1 plants have only one copy of thepsbS gene, and npq4–1 plants do not have anypsbS gene. For RNA extraction and immunoblot analysis, leaves were harvested 3 h into the light period, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80 °C. Chloroplast thylakoid membrane isolations, including grinding, resuspension, and reaction buffers and sample preparation protocols for the lifetime measurements were described previously (13Gilmore A.M. Shinkarev V.P. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Gilmore A.M. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 67: 89-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted from young flower buds (34Shure M. Wessler S. Federoff N. Cell. 1983; 35: 225-233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), and RNA was extracted from leaves (35Bugos R.C. Yamamoto H.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6320-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For DNA gels, genomic DNA was digested with XbaI. A 0.9-kb fragment of thepsbS cDNA (EST clone 135M5T7) was amplified by PCR with the primers KN118 (5′-TCCTTCTCTCATCCTCAGAAA-3′) and KN119 (5′-CAACATGAAGAGAAGGTCACA-3′) and used as a hybridization probe for both DNA and RNA blots. DNA gel blot analysis was conducted using the AlkPhos Direct Kit detected with the CDP-Starchemiluminescent method (Amersham Biosciences). RNA gel blot analysis was done using the DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Thylakoids used in the Chl fluorescence lifetime experiments described below were frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at −80 °C, and then dissolved in solubilization buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3.5% SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1m urea, 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). SDS-PAGE was conducted under denaturing conditions with a precast 10–20% acrylamide gel with Tris-glycine buffer (NOVEX, San Diego). A protein sample containing 1 nmol of Chl was loaded in each lane. The polyclonal antibody recognizing PsbS was generated (Sigma-Genosys) in rabbits against an Arabidopsis PsbS peptide, which is between the second and third transmembrane helices at the stromal side of the native protein. The sequence used to generate the antibody was CGDRGKFVDDPPTG. The anti-D1 antibody was kindly provided by Prof. Anastasios Melis (University of California, Berkeley). Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescent Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences). PsbS levels were normalized to D1 protein on the same blot. The Chl fluorescence data for Fig. 2 were obtained from attached rosette leaves using a commercial fluorometer (FMS2, Hansatech, King’s Lynn, UK). After an overnight dark period, standard Chl fluorescence parameters (36van Kooten O. Snel J.F.H. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar) were measured before, during, and after illumination with 1000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 for 6 min. NPQ was calculated as (Fm-Fm′)/Fm′. The measurements were performed on six different plants of each genotype. The Chl fluorescence data for Fig. 3A were obtained from intact detached leaf samples inside a light-tight, temperature-controlled cuvette with a PAM Chl fluorometer (37Schreiber U. Schliwa U. Bilger W. Photosynth. Res. 1986; 10: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar) equipped with the ED101-BL emitter detector unit (Heinz-Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). The fluorescence was excited by the blue excitation LED (440 nm) and measured with a 10-nm bandpass emission filter centered at 685 nm. The analog PAM signal was digitized and recorded at a sampling rate of 3 Hz through the auxiliary channel of an SLM 8100 spectrofluorimeter (Spectronic Inc., Rochester, NY). After dark-adapting the plant material for at least 60 min, the intensity of the open PSII traps (Fo) was determined for 30 s with the weak 1.6-kHz measuring beam (<0.25 μmol of photons m−2s−1). A 2-s pulse of high intensity white light (10,000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1, Walz DT-Cyan filter) was delivered simultaneously with switching the PAM measuring beam from 1.6 to 100 kHz to determine the maximal fluorescence level (Fm) with all PSII traps closed. A train of identical high intensity pulses ensued at a rate of 1 pulse every 100 s for the duration of the experiment to determine the maximal fluorescence level under the conditions of thylakoid membrane energization (Fm′). Immediately following the initial Fo and Fm determination, the leaf samples were exposed to a continuous white actinic light (750 μmol of photons m−2s−1, Walz DT-Cyan filter) for 300 s at a temperature of 25 °C with the PAM measuring beam at 100 kHz. The temperature was attenuated to −2 °C over the next 300 s upon which time actinic light was extinguished, and the PAM measuring beam was switched to 1.6 kHz. The Fm′ was determined every 100 s for 600 s upon which time the temperature was ramped back up to 25 °C over a 300-s interval. The Fm′ (or Fm) determinations (depending on the interpretation of dark-sustained thylakoid membrane lumen acidification) continued for an additional 600 s. The determination of the PSII Chl afluorescence intensity and lifetimes followed the eight-step protocol defined by Gilmore et al. (13Gilmore A.M. Shinkarev V.P. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The only notable exception was that the lifetimes were measured with an ISS K2-004 lifetime spectrofluorimeter (ISS Inc., Urbana, IL) via a quartz fiber optic probe using the emission/excitation wavelength specifications defined by Gilmore & Yamamoto (20Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition to the reaction buffer, other chemical additions included 7.5 μmtotal Chl, 30 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.3 mm ATP, and 35 μm methylviologen in 3-ml quartz cuvettes for all samples. When necessary, DCMU was added to 10 μmand nigericin to 2 μm. The thylakoids were treated in the same temperature-controlled cuvette described for the leaf experiments above except that the actinic light intensity was 500 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 for 10 min at 25 °C followed by addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 5 mm and continued actinic illumination for 10 min while the reaction temperature was lowered to 0 °C. The level of violaxanthin de-epoxidation was controlled by addition of a subsaturating level of DTT (0–1 mm) prior to actinic illumination. Pigment measurements from leaves were performed by HPLC according to Mu¨ller-Mouleá et al. (38Mu¨ller-Mouleá P. Conklin P.L. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 970-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). For each condition, measurements were done on six individual plants of each genotype. Thylakoid samples were immediately frozen at 77 K following the experiments and stored at −80 °C until HPLC analysis according to the method of Gilmore and Yamamoto (39Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 543: 137-145Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). As outlined in previous studies (12Gilmore A.M. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2273-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Gilmore A.M. Shinkarev V.P. Hazlett T.L.

Debrunner P.G. Govindjee Photosynth. Res. 1996; 48: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we analyzed the fluorescence lifetime distributions assuming three major distinct PSII Chl fluorescence lifetime states that correspond to the following structural model assumptions. 1) W is a PSII unit containing unprotonated unknown CP protein(s) incapable of binding the Z or A molecules. 2) X is a PSII unit containing the protonated unknown CP protein(s) capable of, but not actively binding a Z or A molecule; and finally 3) Y is a PSII unit with protonated unknown CP protein(s) and with a bound Z or A molecule. In simplest terms conversion of the protonation of the unknown CP protein is defined with a simple Henderson-Hasselbach titration (defined by a pKavalue). Also the concentration dependence of the binding of Z and A to the protonated unknown CP protein is defined as an equilibrium association (defined by a Ka value). In SchemeFS1 the total sum of all three PSII states is normalized and defined as [W] + [X] + [Y] = 1 wherepKa = pH − log[W]/[X] andKa = [X]/[Y]·[A + Z]. The following balanced analytical Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 defined as, [W]=1/(1+10pKa­pH(1+Ka[A+Z]))Equation 1 [X]=10pKa­pH/(1+10pKa­pH(1+Ka[A+Z]))Equation 2 [Y]=Ka[A+Z]10pKa­pH/(1+10pKa­pH(1+Ka[A+Z]))Equation 3 were derived from the Scheme FS1 with the assistance of Dr. V. P. Shinkarev of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Center for Biophysics and Computational Biology (11Gilmore A.M. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 99: 197-209Crossref Google Scholar, 13Gilmore A.M.

Govindjee Concepts in photobiology: Photosynthesis and Photomorphogenesis. Narosa Publishing House, New Delhi, India1999: 513-548Google Scholar). Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 were used to calculate the pKa, [W], [X], and [Y] given the measured constant level of the ATPase-induced thylakoid lumen pH and the variable [A + Z]/[V + A + Z] levels. The integral fractions of the [W] + [X] + [Y] parameters were normalized to unity by employing the area form of the Lorentzian distribution equations. The lumen pH was estimated using the 9-aminoacridine technique (42Schuldiner S. Rottenberg H. Avron M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), and the levels of [A + Z]/[V + A + Z] were varied with DTT concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 mm, essentially as described by Gilmore et al. (13Gilmore A.M. Shinkarev V.P. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The measured values for [A+Z] and the lumen pH = 5.18 ± 0.01 were fixed. The free parameters included the pKa andKa values and all the width and lifetime mode parameters of the Lorentzian distributions. The linking scheme assumed all Lorentzian mode and width parameters corresponding to each given PSII state represented mean linked values. The heart of the global target scheme reduced to a minimum of nine free parameters, including three modes plus three widths for the entire data set plus twoKa values for the two samples types with measurable [PsbS], namely, the wild type and F1. The pKawas assumed to be linked between the wild type and F1. In thenpq4-1 samples lacking PsbS, the fraction of the [W] state was normalized as unity for the final solution since there was little or no observed pH- or xanthophyll-dependent change in the fluorescence lifetime integrals, averages, or intensities. Two other minor modes were also included in the fits for all three materials in addition to the three major modes directly related to the model. One was a narrow distribution (∼50-ps wide) with the mode and width parameters linked for all samples and free amplitudes which accounted for rapid decays (<50 ps), including energy transfer and exciton equilibration processes. The fast distribution overlapped with the lower lifetime limit of 0 ns and thus possibly accounted for a slight excitation light scatter and/or filter leakage. The second (>5 ns) distribution included all free floating parameters and accounted for decay variations attributed to instrumental tuning and decay signals from Chls dissociated from proteins and other impurities and long-lived background components; the variation in this component was also possibly related to natural variation in the longer lifetime tail of the Lorentzian distributions of the W state attributed to heterogeneity of the Chl protein environment (40Gilmore A.M. Hazlett T.L. Debrunner P.G. Govindjee Photosynth. Res. 1996; 48: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The global analysis program was written with Visual Basic for Applications 97 for use in Microsoft Windows NT4.0 (32 bit) and Excel 97, and it utilized a Large Scale General Reduced Gradient (LSGRG) minimization engine developed by Frontline Systems Inc. (Incline Village, NV). The search engine is capable of solving, in Excel 97 with a Pentium III computer with 500 Mb RAM and an 800 MHz processor, all 26 test problems prescribed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) website for Nonlinear Regression (www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/nls/nls_info.shtml) with 10 digit precision for the sum of squares parameter. The global reduced chi-square equation (15Alcala J.R. Gratton E. Prendergrast F.G. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 587-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 43Bevington P.R.

McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1969Google Scholar) was minimized assuming the following uncertainties for the phase angle shift (φ) ςp = 0.025° and the demodulation ratio (M) ςm = 0.005. The final goodness of fit was judged by nonlinear regression of the φ and M to calculate an r2 regression coefficient and F-test. The standard errors for all global model parameters and regression coefficients were calculated from the diagonal elements of the inverted variance-covariance matrix (44Draper N.R. Smith H. Applied regression analysis. 3rd Ed. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1998Crossref Scopus (15868) Google Scholar). The randomness and normality of the residual error distribution were further judged by calculation of a second chi square statistic (45Straume M. Johnson M.L.

Moreover, exposure to hypoxia increases the ability of breast carcinoma cells to invade the extracellular matrix, an important aspect of metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that the hypoxic up-regulation of invasiveness is linked to reduced nitric oxide signaling. Incubation of human breast carcinoma cells in 0.5% versus 20% oxygen increased their in vitro invasiveness and their expression of the urokinase receptor, an invasion-associated molecule. These effects of hypoxia were inhibited by nitric oxide-mimetic drugs; and in a manner similar to hypoxia, pharmacological inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis increased urokinase receptor expression. The nitric oxide signaling pathway involves activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and the subsequent activation of protein kinase G (PKG). Culture of tumor cells under hypoxic conditions (0.5% versus 20% oxygen) resulted in lower cGMP levels, an effect that could be prevented by incubation with glyceryl trinitrate. Inhibition of sGC activity with a selective blocker or with the heme biosynthesis inhibitor desferrioxamine increased urokinase receptor expression. These compounds also prevented the glyceryl trinitrate-mediated suppression of urokinase receptor expression in cells incubated under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, direct activation of PKG using 8-bromo-cGMP prevented the hypoxia- and desferrioxamine-induced increases in urokinase receptor expression as well as the hypoxia-mediated enhanced invasiveness. Further involvement of PKG in the regulation of invasion-associated phenotypes was established using a selective PKG inhibitor, which alone increased urokinase receptor expression. These findings reveal that an important mechanism by which hypoxia increases tumor cell invasiveness (and possibly metastasis) requires inhibition of the nitric oxide signaling pathway involving sGC and PKG activation.

Hypoxia in cancers is associated with resistance to therapy and with increased tumor growth and metastatic potential. Several studies have demonstrated that tumor cells exposed to hypoxia exhibit reduced sensitivity to radiation and drug therapy (1Brown J.M.

Exposure of human MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells to hypoxia enhances their ability to invade the extracellular matrix (Matrigel), and this effect of hypoxia is linked to increased expression of the cell-surface urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) 1The abbreviations used are: uPAR, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; PKG, protein kinase G; GTN, glyceryl trinitrate; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; l-NMMA, N-monomethyl-l-arginine; DFO, desferrioxamine mesylate; ODQ, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one; Br, bromo; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. (4Graham C.H. Forsdike J. Fitzgerald C.F. MacDonald-Goodfellow S. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hypoxia has been shown to increase metastasis of human melanoma cells transplanted into nude mice by up-regulating uPAR expression (8Rofstad E.K. Rasmussen H. Galappathi K. Mathiesen B. Nilsen K. Graff B.A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1847-1853PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that a causal link between hypoxia and the acquisition of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is a reduction in the production of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) by tumor cells (2Matthews N.E. Adams M.A. Maxwell L.R. Gofton T.E. Graham C.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In that study, the increase in drug resistance caused by hypoxia was prevented by low concentrations of NO-mimetic drugs; and in a manner similar to hypoxia, pharmacological inhibition of endogenous NO production with an NO synthase inhibitor led to a drug resistance phenotype. Those findings suggested that NO may play a function in the regulation of tumor cell adaptive responses to alterations in local oxygenation levels. Nitric oxide is produced endogenously by the enzyme NO synthase (9Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and has been implicated in several biological processes such as gene regulation. For example, NO has been shown to activate AP-1 (activatorprotein-1)-regulated genes via a pathway dependent on cGMP production (10Sciorati C. Nistico G. Meldolesi J. Clementi E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide also modulates hypoxic gene expression. Studies have revealed that NO inhibits the hypoxic induction of erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (11Sogawa K. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Ema M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is a well characterized receptor for NO. This heterodimeric protein catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cGMP. Nitric oxide binds to the heme moiety of sGC, thereby inducing conformational changes that result in sGC activation. cGMP is, in turn, a second messenger that amplifies NO signals to downstream effectors (14Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of cGMP have been negatively correlated with vascular smooth muscle growth and have been shown to prevent platelet aggregation as well as the adherence of neutrophils to endothelial cells (15Nunokawa Y. Tanaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Sogo N. Magid K.S. Shaw C.A. Webb D.J. Megson I.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, there is also evidence that cGMP can prevent the hypoxic up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor expression (12Liu Y. Christou H. Morita T. Laughner E. Semenza G.L. Kourembanas S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15257-15262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Several proteins interact with cGMP and potentially regulate gene expression and cell phenotype at various levels of the signaling cascade. These include protein kinase G (PKG), cGMP-activated phosphodiesterases, and cGMP-gated ion channels. Of these, it is thought that PKG is responsible for the majority of the cellular effects of cGMP. PKG is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated following cGMP binding (18Lincoln T.M. Dey N. Sellak H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Upon activation, PKG phosphorylates many intracellular targets, often resulting in alterations in gene expression. Based on the previous knowledge that NO plays a role in the regulation of cellular adaptive responses to hypoxia and given the importance of cGMP-dependent signaling in the actions of NO, we sought to investigate the role of sGC, cGMP, and PKG in the NO-mediated regulation of tumor cell invasion. Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN; Sabex, Boucherville, Quebec, Canada) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP; Sigma) were used as NO-mimetic drugs. N-Monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA; Calbiochem-Novabiochem) was used to inhibit endogenous NO production. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) was used to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity. Desferrioxamine mesylate (DFO; Sigma) was used as an iron chelator and inhibitor of heme biosynthesis. 1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; Sigma) was used to selectively inhibit sGC. 8-Bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP; Sigma) was used to activate PKG, and KT5823 (Calbiochem) was used to selectively inhibit PKG. The MDA-MB-231 cell line was maintained in monolayer culture in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a standard Sanyo CO2 incubator (5% CO2 in air at 37 °C; Esbe Scientific, Markham, Ontario, Canada). This is a metastatic breast cancer cell line that was initially isolated in 1973 from a pleural effusion obtained from a 51-year-old patient (19Cailleau R. Young R. Olive M. Reeves Jr., W.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1974; 53: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). To establish hypoxic conditions, cells were placed in airtight chambers (BellCo Biotechnology, Vineland, NJ) that were flushed with a gas mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% N2. Oxygen concentrations within these chambers were maintained at 0.5% using Pro-Ox Model 110 O2 regulators (BioSpherix, Redfield, NY) as described previously (2Matthews N.E. Adams M.A. Maxwell L.R. Gofton T.E. Graham C.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of hypoxia and the NO signaling pathway on the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells, we used a previously described assay (4Graham C.H. Forsdike J. Fitzgerald C.F. MacDonald-Goodfellow S. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) that employs reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel®, Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) as the substrate for invasion. Briefly, Costar Transwell® plastic inserts with a 6.5-mm diameter polycarbonate membrane (8-μm pore; Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were coated with 100 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution of Matrigel diluted in serum-free culture medium, placed in the wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate, and allowed to air-dry for ∼12 h. After reconstituting the Matrigel with serum-free medium, 5.0 × 104 cells in serum-containing medium were added to the inserts. Following a 24-h incubation under either hypoxic or standard conditions, in the absence or presence of drugs, cells on the surface of the Matrigel-coated polycarbonate membrane (non-invading cells) were removed by scraping with a cotton swab. Cells that invaded the Matrigel and the pores of the underlying membrane were fixed in Carnoy's fixative (25% acetic acid and 75% methanol) and stained with 1% toluidine blue in 1% sodium borate. Following several rinses in tap water, the membranes were removed with a small scalpel blade, placed on a microscope slide, and coverslipped. The “invasion index” was determined by counting, under a microscope, the total number of stained cells on the underside of the polycarbonate membranes. In a pilot study, we determined that the rate of MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation is identical at 1% versus 20% O2 for at least 48 h, thereby indicating that differences in cell numbers on the membranes at the end of the invasion assay are reflective of altered invasive ability alone. Following incubation, total cellular RNA from cells was isolated using a Gentra Purescript® RNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The isolated RNA was subsequently separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a charged nylon membrane (Micron Separations, Westborough, MA), and fixed with ultraviolet radiation using a UV cross-linker (Bio-Rad). The membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C in a hybridization incubator for ∼1 h using prewarmed ULTRAhyb® hybridization buffer (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). They were then hybridized overnight at 42 °C with a uPAR cDNA probe that was cloned in a Bluescript plasmid vector and labeled with [32P]dCTP using anAmersham Biosciences Oligolabelling kit. Following serial washes, the membranes were used to expose Kodak X-Omat Blue film. After 1–4 days, the film was developed and analyzed. The density of the rRNA bands was used to normalize the amount of total RNA loaded in each well. To determine sGC activity, cellular cGMP levels were measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (STI-Signal Transduction Products, San Clemente, CA). Briefly, cells were cultured for 6 h in 20% or 0.5% O2 in the presence or absence of GTN (1 μm). 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (500 μm) was included in the culture medium to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity, thereby allowing for a measurable accumulation of cGMP. Cells were subsequently extracted over ice in 1 ml of 6% trichloroacetic acid (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, England). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant fraction was removed and extracted five times with 2 ml of water-saturated diethyl ether (BDH Laboratory Supplies). The cGMP contained in this fraction was subsequently acetylated and measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Following incubation, cells were lysed in 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were homogenized, followed by DNA shearing (10 times with a 25 58-gauge needle), boiling (5 min), and centrifugation (14,000 × g for 15 min). The supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C until used. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the resolved proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a wet transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in a solution containing 1% phosphate-buffered saline and 0.01% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 5% dry milk powder. The blots were subsequently incubated for 1.5 h with a monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody (2 μg/ml; monoclonal antibody 3937, American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT) or polyclonal anti-sGC antiserum (0.5 μg/ml; Cayman Chemical Co., Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), followed by six 5-min washes with PBS-T. The membranes incubated with the anti-uPAR antibody were incubated for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:7500 dilution; Bio-Rad), and the membranes incubated with the anti-sGC antibody were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:15000 dilution; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Following six additional 5-min washes with PBS-T, secondary antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure on Kodak X-Omat Blue film. X-ray films of Northern and Western blot experiments were scanned and analyzed using a SigmaGel densitometry software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using the StatView statistical software package (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkley, CA). Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Fisher's post hoc analysis. Student's t test was used when only two sets of data were compared. All statistical tests were two-sided, and differences were considered statistically significant atp < 0.05. As shown in Fig.1, although hypoxia increased thein vitro invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells by >5-fold, this effect of hypoxia was prevented by concomitant treatment with low concentrations of two different NO-mimetic drugs, GTN (1 pm and 0.1 μm; p < 0.002 and 0.001, respectively; one-way analysis of variance, followed by Fisher's test) and SNP (0.1 nm; p < 0.001), administered at the beginning of the 24-h invasion assay. In our previous study (4Graham C.H. Forsdike J. Fitzgerald C.F. MacDonald-Goodfellow S. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we showed that the hypoxic up-regulation of invasiveness is accompanied by increased uPAR expression and that a blocking anti-uPAR antibody could prevent the hypoxic up-regulation of invasiveness, thereby establishing a causal link between uPAR expression and hypoxia-induced invasion. In the present study, culture of MDA-MB-231 cells in 0.5% O2 for 24 h also resulted in up to 3.5-fold increases (p< 0.0001) in uPAR protein levels (Figs.2 A and 5 B) and up to 5-fold increases (p < 0.0002) in uPAR mRNA levels (Figs. 2 C, 4 A, and 5 A). Moreover, administration of single doses of GTN (1 pm, 1 nm, and 0.1 μm) to cells incubated for 24 h in 0.5% O2 was sufficient to prevent the up-regulation of uPAR protein expression (p < 0.004, 0.005, and 0.001 for each concentration of GTN, respectively) (Fig.2 A). Similarly, the hypoxia-mediated increase in uPAR mRNA levels was also inhibited when a low concentration of GTN (1 pm) was used (p < 0.001) (Fig.2 C).Figure 5Effect of 8-Br-cGMP on hypoxia- and DFO-induced uPAR expression in MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells.

Adams M.A. Maxwell L.R. Gofton T.E. Graham C.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To assess whether endogenous NO inhibits uPAR expression, NO synthesis in MDA-MB-231 cells was blocked by incubation with the NO synthase inhibitorl-NMMA (0.5 μm). In a manner characteristic of cells exposed to hypoxia, a 24-h incubation with a single dose ofl-NMMA resulted in an overall 50% increase (p < 0.004) in uPAR protein levels (Fig.2 B) and a 2.8-fold increase (p < 0.04) in uPAR mRNA levels (Fig. 2 D) in MDA-MB-231 cells even when cultured in 20% O2. In contrast, compared with uPAR expression in cells incubated in 20% O2 alone, no significant increase in uPAR protein (p = 0.89) or transcript (p = 0.35) levels was observed in cells incubated with a combination of l-NMMA (0.5 mm) and GTN (0.1 nm) in 20% O2 (Fig. 2,B and D). The results obtained using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cGMP revealed that, compared with cells incubated in 20% O2, MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells incubated in 0.5% O2 for 6 h in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (500 μm) exhibited a 50% reduction in accumulated cGMP levels (p < 0.002) (Fig.3 A). This effect of hypoxia on cGMP levels was prevented by co-incubation with the NO-mimetic drug GTN (1 μm). Western blot analysis was conducted to determine the effects of hypoxia on sGC protein levels. sGC is a heterodimeric protein consisting mainly of an α1- and a β1-subunit. Culture under hypoxic conditions for 24 h resulted in a 44% decrease in the levels of the β1-subunit (p < 0.0001). In contrast, culture under hypoxic conditions resulted in a 2.3-fold increase (p < 0.02) in the levels of the α1-subunit (Fig. 3 B). Although the ratio of the α1- and β1-subunits was altered during hypoxia, the total amount of sGC was not significantly changed. Fig. 4 A shows that, compared with incubation of cells under control conditions (20% O2 alone), incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells for 24 h with the selective sGC blocker ODQ (0.5 μm) resulted in a 2.7-fold increase (p < 0.05) in the levels of uPAR mRNA (Fig. 4 A). Although the presence of GTN (1 μm) prevented the hypoxic up-regulation of uPAR mRNA expression, GTN was unable to block the effect of hypoxia when ODQ was also present in the medium (Fig. 4 A). sGC is a heme-containing enzyme that requires ferrous iron for its biosynthesis and activity. Therefore, to further assess the participation of this enzyme in the regulation of uPAR expression by the NO signaling pathway, we cultured MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of DFO (100 μm), an iron chelator and inhibitor of heme biosynthesis. The results showed that, in a manner similar to culture under hypoxic conditions or after pharmacological inhibition of NO synthase, culture in the presence of DFO resulted in a 4-fold increase (p < 0.007) in the levels of uPAR mRNA (Figs.4 B and 5 C). In contrast to hypoxia, the effect of DFO on uPAR mRNA expression was not prevented by 1 μm GTN. Furthermore, the up-regulation of uPAR mRNA and protein expression by hypoxia was significantly reduced (p < 0.0001) in a dose-dependent manner (up to 100%) by the presence of 8-Br-cGMP (0.1–10 μm, 24 h), a non-hydrolyzable analog of cGMP (Fig. 5, A andB). Interestingly, the presence of 8-Br-cGMP (1 μm) also resulted in the complete inhibition (p < 0.01) of the DFO-induced up-regulation of uPAR mRNA expression (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that a major component of the hypoxia- and DFO-mediated stimulation of uPAR expression is the inhibition of sGC. As indicated earlier, cGMP-mediated activation of PKG is an important component of the NO signaling pathway. To further elucidate the role of NO signaling in the regulation of uPAR expression, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated for 6 h with the PKG inhibitor KT5823 (10 μm). Northern and Western blot analyses revealed that selective inhibition of PKG, even in 20% O2, resulted in a 1.8-fold increase (p < 0.05) in uPAR protein and mRNA expression (Fig.6, A and B). These results demonstrate that PKG activation by cGMP is necessary for the inhibition of uPAR expression by NO. Results from the in vitro invasion assay using Matrigel as a substrate for invasion revealed that, compared with the invasiveness of cells incubated in 20% O2, hypoxia stimulated the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells by 3.9-fold (p < 0.0001) (Fig.7). This effect of hypoxia on invasiveness was completely inhibited by the presence of various concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP (0.1 μm to 1 mm) (Fig. 7). The major finding of this study is that NO signaling plays an important role in the regulation of hypoxia-induced invasiveness of human MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. Furthermore, our results strongly suggest that the mechanisms by which cells adapt to hypoxia and reduced NO activity involve convergent processes. This study also presents a novel role for cGMP-dependent signaling in the regulation of cellular invasiveness. Specifically, it was shown that the NO-mediated inhibition of uPAR expression is dependent on the sequential activation of sGC and PKG. Furthermore, it was determined that the hypoxic up-regulation of uPAR expression and the concomitant enhancement of thein vitro invasiveness are associated with reduced levels of sGC and PKG signaling. Because invasion of the extracellular matrix is an essential component of the metastatic process, these results suggest that perturbations in the cGMP-dependent signaling pathway could lead to increases in metastatic potential. Our results show that the effects of hypoxia on sGC activity and uPAR expression can be prevented by low concentrations of GTN. These findings point to a mechanism of oxygen sensing and gene regulation whereby phenotypes are modified in response to a decrease in NO-mediated signaling. As shown in Fig.8, we propose that this phenomenon is due to a reduction in endogenous NO synthesis. Molecular oxygen is obligatory for the conversion of l-arginine into NO andl-citrulline by the enzyme NO synthase (20Dweik R.A. Laskowski D. Abu-Soud H.M. Kaneko F. Hutte R. Stuehr D.J. Erzurum S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Indeed, exposure of cells to low levels of O2 (1–3%) inhibits NO production by up to 90% (21Whorton A.R. Simonds D.B. Piantadosi C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L1161-L1166PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the reduced NO levels associated with hypoxia, there is a decrease in guanylyl cyclase activity and a consequential reduction in cGMP levels (Fig. 8). Supporting this concept, Taylor et al. (22Taylor C.T. Lisco S.J. Awtrey C.S. Colgan S.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 568-575PubMed Google Scholar) showed that culturing intestinal epithelial cells under hypoxic conditions (1% O2) results in a significant decrease in basal and stimulated cGMP levels. Here, we have similarly shown that low O2 levels decrease cGMP generation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the decrease in cGMP signaling is correlated with an enhancement of uPAR expression as well as with increased invasiveness. To strengthen the concept that uPAR expression is regulated through sGC activation, this study showed that GTN was unable to inhibit uPAR expression when sGC activity was directly blocked with either ODQ or DFO (Fig. 4). Previous studies have shown that treatment with DFO results in cellular adaptive responses similar to those induced by hypoxia (13Huang L.E. Willmore W.G., Gu, J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 23Gleadle J.M. Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. Am. J.

Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that a hemeprotein or changes in the redox status of cells are responsible for the adaptive responses to hypoxia (26Ratcliffe P.J. O'Rourke J.F. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1153-1162PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the DFO-mediated up-regulation of uPAR expression was inhibited by 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 5). This indicates that a major component of the DFO-mediated stimulation of uPAR expression is inhibition of guanylyl cyclase activity and that DFO does not interfere with signals acting downstream of guanylyl cyclase. There are many potential targets that could be phosphorylated by PKG and therefore serve as downstream effectors in the NO signaling pathway. One possible mechanism by which PKG regulates cellular adaptations to changes in oxygenation involves a perturbation of the MAPK pathway. This pathway is activated by hypoxia (27Lo L.W. Cheng J.J. Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Liu Y.C. Wang D.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and studies have shown that NO can prevent the phosphorylation of ERK through a PKG-mediated interference of Ras/Raf (28Yu S.M. Hung L.M. Lin C.C. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by the study of Mitani et al. (29Mitani Y. Zaidi S.H. Dufourcq P. Thompson K. Rabinovitch M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), who showed that NO donors and cGMP-mimetic drugs reduce elastase expression by suppressing ERK phosphorylation. This leads to a subsequent reduction in the activation and DNA-binding capacity of AML1B (the transcription factor for elastase). It is possible that cGMP- dependent NO signaling similarly inhibits hypoxia-induced ERK phosphorylation, thereby decreasing the activation of the transcription factors responsible for the up-regulation of uPAR expression. The promoter region of uPAR contains binding sites for transcription factors such as AP-1, Sp1/3, and nuclear factor-κB (30Wang Y. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 146-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). HIF-1 levels may also contribute to the transcriptional activation of the uPAR gene, as previous examination of the sequences upstream of the uPAR initiation codon revealed the presence of potential HIF-1-binding sites (31Graham C.H. Fitzpatrick T.E. McCrae K.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 3300-3307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that HIF-1 accumulation and transcriptional activity can be reduced by relatively high concentrations (2.5–500 μm) of NO-mimetic drugs such as SNP, S-nitroso-l-glutathione, and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (12Liu Y. Christou H. Morita T. Laughner E. Semenza G.L. Kourembanas S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15257-15262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 13Huang L.E. Willmore W.G., Gu, J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies in our laboratory have confirmed that high concentrations (0.1–1 mm) of GTN and SNP inhibit HIF-1 accumulation and transactivating activity. The invasive potential of a cell is dependent upon its ability to break down components of the extracellular matrix and basement membranes. This process requires the participation of several proteolytic enzyme systems, among which the urokinase plasminogen activator system figures prominently (32Friedl P. Brocker E.B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 41-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In vitro invasiveness has been strongly correlated with the levels of cell-surface uPAR expression (4Graham C.H. Forsdike J. Fitzgerald C.F. MacDonald-Goodfellow S. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 33Kariko K. Kuo A. Boyd D. Okada S.S. Cines D.B. Barnathan E.S.

Canning M.T. Fitzpatrick T.E. Placenta. 2000; 21: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For example, using an in vitro assay similar to the one in this study, Kariko et al. (33Kariko K. Kuo A. Boyd D. Okada S.S. Cines D.B. Barnathan E.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3109-3117PubMed Google Scholar) showed that human osteosarcoma cells transfected with a human uPAR cDNA are four times more invasive than control cells. Xing and Rabbani (34Xing R.H. Rabbani S.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) obtained similar results using a rat mammary carcinoma cell line. We have previously demonstrated that uPAR availability for urokinase plasminogen activator binding is essential for the hypoxic stimulation of invasiveness (4Graham C.H. Forsdike J. Fitzgerald C.F. MacDonald-Goodfellow S. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 35Graham C.H. Postovit L.-M. Park H. Canning M.T. Fitzpatrick T.E. Placenta. 2000; 21: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). There is also clinical and experimental evidence that increased uPAR expression is associated with metastasis of prostate, colon, and breast carcinomas (34Xing R.H. Rabbani S.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 36Crowley C.W. Cohen R.L. Lucas B.K. Liu G. Shuman M.A. Levinson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mathiesen B. Nilsen K. Graff B.A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1847-1853PubMed Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that hypoxia-induced metastasis is dependent on uPAR up-regulation. Thus, we postulate that the cGMP-dependent inhibition of invasiveness observed in the present study was partially due to down-regulation of uPAR expression. Although the role of uPAR in invasion and tumor progression has been studied extensively, the mechanisms governing its expression are not fully understood. In characterizing the contribution of the plasminogen activator system to the regulation of invasiveness and metastasis, the present study confirmed that uPAR message and protein are up-regulated during hypoxia. In addition, we demonstrated that the NO signaling pathway involving sGC and PKG activation is an integral component of the mechanism that regulates uPAR expression as well as invasiveness. In summary, this study specifically links NO-mediated activation of sGC and PKG to the regulation of tumor cell invasiveness. Furthermore, our results suggest that sGC and PKG may be useful pharmacological targets for the prevention of cancer invasion and metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W2059265978,"Post-transcriptional pathways provide a major means of regulating eukaryotic gene expression. Reiterations of the AU-rich element (ARE) within the 3′-untranslated region of many cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs serve as signals for rapid degradation and translational repression. The identification of thiscis-acting stability determinant has fueled the search for ARE-binding proteins (AUBP) that function as trans-acting factors that transduce this function. Previous work identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 as a major AUBP capable of binding the ARE of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) RNA in the context of a full-length mRNA. We report here that functional studies failed to indicate a role for hnRNP A1 in ARE-dependent mRNA turnover. In an effort to identify other functionally relevant AUBP, the major GM-CSF ARE-specific binding protein in cells lacking hnRNP A1 was purified from CB3 mouse erythroleukemia cells. Microsequencing identified this protein as the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) M. RNA binding by LDH was shown to occur in the NAD+-binding region (Rossmann fold). Polysome gradient analysis demonstrates that LDH is found in the translationally active fraction. Polysomal localization of LDH was dependent on RNA binding. Moreover, polysomal LDH exists in a complex with AUF1 and hsp-70, which has been implicated previously in the regulation of mRNA turnover. The interaction between LDH and AUF1 is direct as it can be demonstrated in vitro with purified proteins. Collectively these data implicate a role for LDH in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Post-transcriptional pathways provide a major means of regulating eukaryotic gene expression. Reiterations of the AU-rich element (ARE) within the 3′-untranslated region of many cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs serve as signals for rapid degradation and translational repression. The identification of thiscis-acting stability determinant has fueled the search for ARE-binding proteins (AUBP) that function as trans-acting factors that transduce this function. Previous work identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 as a major AUBP capable of binding the ARE of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) RNA in the context of a full-length mRNA. We report here that functional studies failed to indicate a role for hnRNP A1 in ARE-dependent mRNA turnover. In an effort to identify other functionally relevant AUBP, the major GM-CSF ARE-specific binding protein in cells lacking hnRNP A1 was purified from CB3 mouse erythroleukemia cells. Microsequencing identified this protein as the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) M. RNA binding by LDH was shown to occur in the NAD+-binding region (Rossmann fold).

The interaction between LDH and AUF1 is direct as it can be demonstrated in vitro with purified proteins. Collectively these data implicate a role for LDH in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The regulation of mRNA turnover is a key mechanism of modulating eukaryotic gene expression. Labile cytokine, lymphokine, and proto-oncogene messages contain AU-rich sequences in their 3′-untranslated regions that are highly conserved across mammalian species. As demonstrated conclusively by Shaw and Kamen (1Shaw G. Kamen R.

These ARE consist of reiterations of the pentamer AUUUA or oligo(U) sequences in an AU-rich context (1Shaw G. Kamen R.

Although a variety of these AUBP has been described, functional roles in ARE-dependent turnover have been attributed to a comparatively small number of proteins, including HuR and AUF1 (5Ma W.J.

Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), as well as with synthetic mRNA-destabilizing ARE (6Myer V.E. Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2130-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Several studies (7Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 8Levy N.S.

These studies did not demonstrate altered protein production as a consequence of increased mRNA accumulation (5Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 6Myer V.E. Fan X.C. Steitz J.A.

Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar).Similarly, in vitro ARE binding activity has been demonstrated for AUF; this protein was initially purified because of its ability to accelerate the degradation of c-myc mRNA in anin vitro decay system (9Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1996-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). However, recent work (11Kiledjian M. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dempsey L.A. Sun H. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1066-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) has suggested AUF1 may play multiple roles in the regulation of mRNA turnover. For example, Kiledjian et al. (11Kiledjian M. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that AUF1 is a component of the α-globin mRNA stabilization complex, whereas other studies (12Dempsey L.A. Sun H. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1066-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have implicated AUF1 in B-cell transcriptional activation. The diversity of functions attributed to AUF1 suggests its activity may be regulated by protein-protein interactions.Our laboratory has been examining potential trans-acting factors involved in mediating ARE-dependent mRNA turnover. Initial studies centered on investigating the role of hnRNP A1, prompted by its discovery as the major cytoplasmic protein capable of binding the GM-CSF ARE in activated T lymphocytes (13Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8881-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hamilton B.J. Burns C.M. Nichols R.C. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28732-28741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-2 overproduction by a retrovirally infected T cell line, MLA-144, was shown to be due to increased mRNA stability (15Henics T. Sanfridson A. Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5377-5383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stabilization of IL-2 mRNA correlated with a proviral insertion in its 3′-UTR which enhances the binding of hnRNP A1 to its ARE relative to that of native IL-2 (15Henics T. Sanfridson A. Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5377-5383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To examine the role of hnRNP A1 in ARE-dependent mRNA turnover, we utilized the DP28-9, CB7, and CB3 murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell lines, which vary in their expression of hnRNP A1 (16Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Chabot B., De Koven A. Bernstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4449-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). DP28-9 MEL cells derive from DBA/2 adult mice infected with a polycythemia-inducing strain of the Friend leukemia virus (FV-P) and contain two functional hnRNP A1 genes (16Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Chabot B., De Koven A. Bernstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4449-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CB7 MEL cell line has only one active hnRNP A1 gene, due to silencing of one allele by a downstream insertion of F-murine leukemia virus helper virus at the Fli-2 locus. In CB3 MEL cells, proviral integration occurred at both Fli-2 loci, resulting in the absence of hnRNP A1 mRNA and protein (16Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Chabot B., De Koven A. Bernstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4449-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Transient as well as stable transfection experiments of CB3 MEL cells with hnRNP A1 failed to indicate an effect of hnRNP A1 on ARE-dependent mRNA turnover or expression of reporter gene constructs. Similarly, overexpression of hnRNP A1 in human Jurkat T cells did not result in alteration of ARE-dependent gene expression.As we were unable to detect an effect of hnRNP A1 on ARE-dependent gene regulation, we examined the AUBP profiles of the three cell lines. The major cytosolic protein capable of binding the ARE of GM-CSF in the context of its full-length RNA in CB3 erythroleukemia cells was identified as l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozyme M. Lactate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the reversible conversion of pyruvate to lactate, is a tetrameric enzyme that may exist in several enzyme forms (17Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, Inc., New York1975: 244-247Google Scholar). Each LDH subunit is one of two types, designated H (for heart) and M (for skeletal muscle). The five tetrameric isozymes of LDH are five different combinations of these subunits (17Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, Inc., New York1975: 244-247Google Scholar). The isozyme of LDH identified in these studies is LDH-M, which consists of five M polypeptide subunits. (For purposes of ease of reference, the LDH-M will be referred to as simply LDH throughout the text.). LDH was shown to bind specifically to the ARE of GM-CSF RNA using both UV cross-linking and filter binding assays. LDH is polysomally associated and coimmunoprecipitates with AUF1 and hsp-70. These finding suggest that LDH may serve multiple roles in RNA metabolism beyond its role in glycolysis. Indeed, non-overlapping roles of LDH are suggested by the fact that the binding of the ARE by LDH is competed by NAD+, indicating that each utilizes the Rossmann fold. Similar roles have been well defined for the iron-response element-binding protein and its dual role as an aconitase (18Hentze M.W. Curr. Stud. Hematol. Blood. Transfus. 1991; 58: 115-126Crossref Google Scholar, 19Melefors O. Hentze M.W. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data implicate LDH as a functionally relevant AUBP and prompt consideration of an expanded role of this enzyme in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.DISCUSSIONAlthough identified as a major AUBP in human and gibbon T lymphocytes as well as mouse erythroleukemia cells (13Hamilton B.J. Nagy E. Malter J.S. Arrick B.A. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8881-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hamilton B.J. Burns C.M. Nichols R.C. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28732-28741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a variety of experiments failed to demonstrate a role for hnRNP A1 on ARE-dependent turnover or translation of reporter gene constructs or GM-CSF mRNA. We concluded therefore that another AUBP besides hnRNP A1 mediates ARE-dependent gene regulation. Experiments to identify the trans-acting factor responsible for mediating the rapid turnover of GM-CSF message were undertaken. Despite the absence of hnRNP A1, CB3 cytosols contain a 36-kDa protein that binds specifically to the ARE of GM-CSF RNA. All previously characterized AUBP of comparable size (GAPDH, HuR, and AUF1) were excluded using immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional NEPHGE immunoblotting approaches.Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry identified the p36 AUBP as LDH. This finding was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of LDH-GM-CSF RNA complexes from CB3 cytosols as well as by in vitro binding (UV cross-linking and filter binding) assays with purified LDH. In addition, incubation of either LDH or CB3 cytosol (data not shown) with increasing concentrations of NAD+ inhibited p36 AUBP activity. This latter finding is consistent with the interpretation that the Rossmann fold serves as the RNA binding domain of LDH, as has been reported previously (20Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) for other glycolytic enzymes. LDH localized to the polysomes in multiple cell types besides CB3 cells. Thus, the polysomal location of LDH did not occur due to the absence of hnRNP A1. Moreover, in all cell types examined, LDH localized to the bottom of the sucrose gradients, consistent with its association with mRNA being actively translated. In addition, direct association of LDH with AUF1 was demonstrated.The role of LDH in intermediary metabolism has been well documented. LDH is a tetrameric enzyme with five isoforms, each consisting of combinations of two subunits, LDH-M and LDH-H (17Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, Inc., New York1975: 244-247Google Scholar). The M subunit catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate under anaerobic conditions, whereas the H subunit kinetically favors the conversion of lactate to pyruvate and predominates in aerobic tissue, such as heart muscle (17Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, Inc., New York1975: 244-247Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of each subunit and thus the amount of each LDH isozyme in a given tissue type is subject to genetic regulation. Although each isozyme catalyzes the same reaction, they have markedly different K m values for pyruvate (17Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, Inc., New York1975: 244-247Google Scholar). The isozyme identified in these studies consists of four identical M subunits and is therefore designated M4. This isozyme predominates in skeletal muscle and has a low K m for pyruvate; hence it readily transfers electrons from lactate to NAD+, yielding pyruvate and NADH (17Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, Inc., New York1975: 244-247Google Scholar). This reaction is dependent on the binding of NAD+ to LDH in the Rossmann fold (17Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, Inc., New York1975: 244-247Google Scholar).Other enzymatic proteins have been identified that bind RNA; these RNA binding activities appear distinct from their functions in metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 27Hentze M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 101-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In previous work from this laboratory (20Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), GAPDH was purified as a polysomal p36 AUBP from human spleen. A number of features of LDH led us to conclude that LDH and GAPDH play differing roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. First, GAPDH appeared to be less specific in its interaction with ARE than LDH, as it was shown to bind a variety of ARE, including those lacking reiterated AUUUA pentamers (IFN-γ and c-Myc) in their 3′-UTR (20Nagy E. Rigby W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Second, nitrocellulose filter binding experiments performed with purified protein revealed the K d of GAPDH for GM-CSF RNA is approximately twice that of LDH for GM-CSF RNA (data not shown). These data indicate that although GAPDH and LDH are capable of binding ARE, LDH binds the 3′-UTR of GM-CSF RNA with greater affinity than GAPDH when analyzed as a purified protein. The interaction of LDH in vivo with other proteins may further enhance this difference in affinity, as we were unable to detect any GM-CSF RNA binding by GAPDH in CB3 cytosols, despite operating under conditions of probe excess. In this regard, immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that LDH, but not GAPDH, interacts with AUF1 in vivo (data not shown). These data reflect the specificity of the LDH/AUF1 association, as well as suggest that LDH and GAPDH may play different roles in ARE-dependent gene regulation, with distinct substrate specificity and function.The localization of LDH to the polysomes of human lymphoid and monocytic cells, which express GM-CSF, supports a functional role for LDH in the regulation of gene expression in vivo. The functional relevance of LDH AUBP activity is supported by its specific interaction with mRNA undergoing active translation. As levels of LDH on polysomes were approximately one-tenth those in the S130 fraction across cell types and species (data not shown), levels of polysomal and cytosolic LDH appear to be tightly regulated. Interestingly, the NAD+ concentration (1 μm) required to significantly inhibit RNA binding by purified LDH is lower than cytosolic NAD+ levels (30–70 μm) (32Micheli V. Sestini S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,33Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897PubMed Google Scholar). Displacement of LDH from the polysome compartment required much higher NAD+ concentrations (100 μm) than those necessary to inhibit RNA binding by purified enzyme. These data suggest that polysomal LDH may have an enhanced affinity for RNA or a decreased affinity for NAD+, perhaps mediated through post-translational modification or protein-protein interactions.In this regard, we have shown that polysomal LDH exists in a large protein complex in the absence of RNA binding. By immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated AUF1 and LDH exist as a complex in vivo. This finding is consistent with the sedimentation of LDH in the most dense gradient of the polysomes, indicating active translation, because AUF1 exists in a complex including heat shock proteins hsp-70, translation initiation factor eIF4G, and poly(A)-binding protein (31Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In support of this model is our finding that hsp-70 coimmunoprecipitates with AUF1 and LDH in THP-1 monocytic cells (Fig.7 A).These data are especially intriguing in light of the diverse cellular functions which have been described for AUF1, which range from telomere maintenance to transcription, as well as mRNA turnover (9Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1996-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 11Kiledjian M. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dempsey L.A. Sun H. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1066-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Eversole A. Maizels N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5425-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the K562 erythroleukemia cell line, distinct effects on mRNA stability have been noted. Kiledjian et al. (11Kiledjian M. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that AUF1 is a component of the α-globin mRNA stabilization complex. Similar to our findings with hnRNP A1, overexpression of AUF1 in the K562 erythroleukemia cell line had no effect on ARE-mediated mRNA turnover (35Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, when induced by hemin to undergo erythroid differentiation, ARE-mediated turnover in K562 erythroleukemia cells was inhibited. Overexpression of AUF1 led to a restoration of ARE-mediated turnover (35Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It is unclear if the changes in ARE-dependent turnover induced by hemin treatment or AUF1 were due to effects on translation and loading onto polysomes. This observation is potentially important as ARE-mediated turnover has been reported to be dependent on either translation or ribosomal transit (36Curatola A.M. Nadal M.S. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6331-6340Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that overexpression of AUF1 restored ARE-dependent mRNA turnover by permitting polysomal loading of these mRNA.These studies are central to consideration of the functional role of the ARE, as protein-protein interactions may influence the role(s) AUF1 serves in DNA and RNA metabolism. In this regard, our data indicate that LDH is associated with AUF1 on mRNA undergoing active translation. Nevertheless, LDH was initially characterized because of its potential role in mediating rapid ARE-dependent turnover in erythroleukemia cells that lack hnRNP A1. One potential model for LDH function is that it provides further specificity for the translation and turnover of certain ARE-containing mRNA through its direct interaction with both the ARE and AUF1 protein. The importance of such a role by LDH is suggested by the finding that recombinant AUF1 binds an array of RNA ligands, including those lacking ARE (11Kiledjian M. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dempsey L.A. Sun H. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1066-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Eversole A. Maizels N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5425-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,37Bhattacharya S. Giordano T. Brewer G. Malter J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Alternatively, LDH may influence, through its direct interaction with AUF1, the makeup of this protein complex or the functional nature of its interaction with ARE. For example, a model has been proposed in which AUF1 mediates ARE-dependent turnover through proteasomal targeting and degradation of the RNP complex (31Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G. Schneider R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is important to note that LDH did not copurify with proteasomes following EDTA treatment of polysomes gradients (data not shown). The possibility that LDH may serve a distinct role in mRNA translation and turnover independent of AUF1 is not excluded by this model.Additionally consistent with its association with both AUF1 and hsp-70in vivo, LDH may mediate effects on mRNA turnover as a component of eukaryotic degradation machinery, in a manner analogous to enolase in E. coli. The degradosome of E. coliconsists of a high molecular weight complex of proteins including RNase E, an endoribonuclease; polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase (PNPase); an ATP-dependent helicase and 3′-5′-exoribonuclease; RhlB, a member of the DEAD box family; polyphosphate kinase; and enolase, a glycolytic enzyme (38Grunberg-Manago M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 193-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Additional proteins are often associated with the degradosome, notably the heat shock chaperones GroEL and DnaK (38Grunberg-Manago M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 193-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The metabolic function of enolase has been defined as the catalysis of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate (17Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, Inc., New York1975: 244-247Google Scholar), although its role in mRNA degradation is not yet clear (39Blum E. Carpousis A.J. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4009-4016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).In conclusion, the discovery of LDH as an RNA-binding protein points to an expanded role for this protein in the regulation of gene expression. Its binding specificity, polysomal localization, and association with AUF1 collectively suggest a role in ARE-dependent mRNA turnover beyond its function in metabolism. The ability of LDH to serve as an AUBP may represent a global mechanism for regulating ARE-mediated decay, perhaps by modulating the effects of AUF1. Of particular note, c-Myc overexpression results in the up-regulation of LDH at the level of gene transcription (40Shim H. Dolde C. Lewis B.C., Wu, C.S. Dang G. Jungmann R.A. Dalla-Favera R.

Finally, the rate constant for reaction leading to the formation of the copper-bound oxidant was estimated to be only 0.1 m−1 s−1 at pH 7.4 (12Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H. Holcman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9967-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is not fast enough to account for the rapid HCO 3−-dependent oxidations (2Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

We now present data and calculations derived therefrom, which shed some light on these reactions. The following scheme of reactions reflect current knowledge. Elaborations, to be presented under “Discussion” will lead to a scheme more in tune with observed reactions and their rates. E—Cu(II)+H2O2⇄E—Cu(I)+O2−+2H+ REACTIONa E—Cu(I)+H2O2→E—Cu(II)OH+OH− REACTIONb E—Cu(II)+O2−→E—Cu(I)+O2 REACTIONc E—Cu(II)OH+His→E—Cu(II)+OH−+His·+ REACTIONd E—Cu(II)OH+HCO3−→E—Cu(II)+H2O+CO3⨪ REACTIONe CO3−·+SH2→HCO3−+SH· REACTIONf CO3−·+His+H+→HCO3−+His·+ REACTIONg Cu(II)OH+urate→Cu(II)+OH−+urate· REACTIONhIn this scheme SH2 denotes a substrate such as NADPH, and His denotes a histidine residue in the ligand field of the copper. This scheme is very similar to the one that we arrived at previously (4Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In Reaction a the enzyme is univalently reduced by H2O2, while in Reaction b the bound oxidant is generated. We consider the oxidant to be bound rather than diffusible because HO· scavengers, such as ethanol, do not protect (1Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and because the oxidation of large substrates depends upon the mediation of bicarbonate (2Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol.

The bound oxidant can inactivate the enzyme by oxidation of a histidine residue (Reaction d) or, it can oxidize HCO 3− to the powerful oxidant CO 3⨪, which then leaves the active site and oxidizes substrates in free solution (Reaction f) or alternately stays in the active site to oxidize a histidine residue (Reaction g). Reaction g was proposed because HCO 3− competes with histidine (Reactions d and e) and should thus protect, which it does not (4Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Urate does protect the enzyme, hence Reaction h. NADPH, horseradish peroxidase, and dianisidine were from Sigma. The dianisidine was twice recrystallized from ethanol. Uric acid and NaHCO3 were from Fisher, H2O2 was from Mallinkrodt, and Cu,Zn-SOD was from Chemie Grunenthal. All experiments were performed in 100 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.4 and at 22–23 °C. When NaHCO 3−was added the buffer was readjusted to pH 7.4 with H2SO4 as needed. Initial rates of oxidation of NADPH were followed at 340 nm and of urate at 295 nm. The usual concentrations of SOD and H2O2 were 0.2 mg/ml and 10 mm, respectively. When [NADPH] or [urate] were varied the HCO 3− was held constant at 50 mm in the case of NADH and at 150 mm in the case of urate. When [HCO 3−] was varied, urate and NADPH were held constant at 60 and 100 μm, respectively. When urate oxidation was examined in the absence of HCO 3−, the [SOD] was raised to 0.8 mg/ml. The results were then corrected to the usual condition by dividing by four. Inactivation of SOD by H2O2 was followed by removing samples at intervals and assaying remaining SOD activity by the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c method (13McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consumption of H2O2 by Cu,Zn-SOD ± HCO 3− was followed by removing samples at intervals, assaying for residual [H2O2] by 25-fold dilution into buffered (pH 7.4) solutions of 0.3 mmdianisidine plus 40 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase, and measuring absorbance at 460 nm. The reduction of 5.0 mg/ml Cu(II),Zn SOD by 2 mm H2O2 was followed at 680 nm. Were the processes presented by Reactions a–h correct we would expect the bound oxidant produced by Reaction b to inactivate the enzyme by Reaction d or, in the presence of HCO 3−, to oxidize extraneous substrates through the mediation of CO 3⨪. The rate of inactivation should in any case equal the maximal rate of oxidation of substrates such as NADPH because both depend on the rate of production of the bound oxidant. We will now show that the rate of inactivation is ∼100-fold slower than the maximal rate of oxidation of either NADPH or urate. Figs. 1 and 2 present the rates of oxidation of urate and of NADPH as a function of HCO 3−. Because the effect of HCO 3− approaches a limit we can use reciprocal coordinates to obtain the maximal rates of oxidation at infinite HCO 3−, which will be referred to as V max, and the concentration of HCO 3− that caused half that maximal rate, which will be referred to as K m. Fig.3 shows the data for NADPH oxidation plotted on reciprocal coordinates, and TableI, lines 1 and 2present K m and V max for the HCO 3− effect on both urate and NADPH oxidation obtained at the indicated concentrations of H2O2 and Cu,Zn-SOD. Lines 3 and4 present K m andV max values for NADPH and urate as the variable substrates at fixed [HCO 3−].Figure 2Bicarbonate-dependent oxidation of urate.

K m andV max for urate oxidation in the absence of HCO 3− were ∼25 μm and 0.7 μm/min, respectively. Urate oxidations in this case were performed at 10 mm H2O2 but at 0.8 mg/ml SOD. Hence the observed V max should be divided by four for comparison with the other V max in the table, i.e. 0.7/4 = 0.18 μm/min. Open table in a new tab In all cases [SOD] was at 0.2 mg/ml and [H2O2] at 10 mm. When [NADPH] was varied [HCO 3−] was at 50 mm, but when urate was varied [HCO 3−] was at 150 mm. When [HCO 3−] was varied [NADPH] was at 100 μm and [urate] at 60 μm. K m andV max for urate oxidation in the absence of HCO 3− were ∼25 μm and 0.7 μm/min, respectively. Urate oxidations in this case were performed at 10 mm H2O2 but at 0.8 mg/ml SOD. Hence the observed V max should be divided by four for comparison with the other V max in the table, i.e. 0.7/4 = 0.18 μm/min. The K m for HCO 3− was approximately equal for both NADPH and urate oxidation. This is expected because both oxidations depend upon the CO 3⨪ leaving the active site. Were NADPH and urate comparable processes we would expect that V max should also be the same for both oxidations. However, V max for NADPH oxidation was 5× greater than V max for urate oxidation. This difference may be partially artifactual Thus oxidation of NADPH to NADP· by CO 3⨪ would be followed by the auto-oxidation of NADP· to NADP+ + O 2⨪ with loss of 340 nm of absorbance. In contrast the oxidation of urate can involve several intermediates, such as allantoin and allantoic acid (14Hicks M. Wong L.S. Day R.O. Free Rad. Res. Comms. 1993; 18: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and some of those may absorb at 295 nm, as does urate, and may also consume CO 3⨪. It is also possible that urate, being an anion, may be less reactive with CO 3⨪ than is the uncharged dihydropyridine moiety of NADPH. When [HCO 3−] was constant at 50 mm and NADPH was varied the K m for NADPH was less than 17 μm. Hence 100 μm NADPH will scavenge essentially all the CO 3⨪ leaving the active site, and the V max for NADPH oxidation, 20 μm/min, must approximate the rate of production of CO 3⨪. K m for urate was also low (∼7.5 μm). The V max obtained by extrapolating to infinite HCO 3− and at 100 μm NADPH was 50 μm/min, which must then approximate the rate of production of the bound oxidant (Reaction b). Urate oxidation in the absence of HCO 3−was so slow that it was advisable to raise [SOD] to achieve a measurable rate. This direct oxidation of urate should reflect the rate of Reaction h. The V max urate of 0.7 μm/min, which would be 0.18 μm/min at 0.2 mg/ml SOD, is more than 50× smaller than the rate in the presence of saturating HCO 3−. Urate is thus a poorer substrate for the bound oxidant than is HCO 3−, yet urate protects while HCO 3− appears not to do so (4Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). How a molecule as large as urate accesses the active site and protects against inactivation by the bound oxidant (Reaction d) remains a puzzle. Fig.4 presents a semilog plot of residual SOD activity during exposure to excess H2O2. Rather than protect, as has been reported by others (3Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28333-28339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Jewett S.L. Olmsted H.K. Marach J.A. Rojas F. Silva K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), HCO 3− modestly increased the rate of inactivation. We previously reported (4Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that 10 mmHCO 3− did not protect in accordance with the results in Fig. 4 where higher concentrations were needed to show a measurable acceleration. The rate of inactivation from Fig. 4was ∼100-fold slower than the V max for the HCO 3−-dependent oxidation of NADPH. Thus the V max for NADPH oxidation from Table I was 50 μm/min, while the inactivation of the Cu,Zn-SOD by 10 mm H2O2, calculated from Fig. 4 on the basis of a subunit mass of 16,000 Da, was 0.5 μm/min. This discrepancy indicates that only a small fraction (∼1%) of the bound oxidant potentially produced by Reaction b is available for Reaction d. An explanation will be presented under “Discussion.” Fig.5 demonstrates that HCO 3− greatly increases the consumption of H2O2 by Cu,Zn-SOD. The effect of HCO 3− was saturable and theV max for this H2O2consumption was similar to that for NADPH oxidation. If the H2O2 reacted rapidly with the bound oxidant its rate of consumption would be high in the absence of HCO 3−, which is not the case. But we know that H2O2 rapidly reduces the Cu(II) enzyme (Reaction a). Hence if HCO 3− has the effect of converting the bound oxidant back to the Cu(II) enzyme by Reaction e that alone would explain the augmentation of H2O2 consumption by HCO 3−; this will be made clear later in the text. Is it also plausible that CO 3⨪ can oxidize H2O2 as in Reaction i CO3⨪+H2O2→HCO3−+H++O2− REACTIONiand thus account for a significant portion of HCO 3−-augmented H2O2 consumption. It is immediately apparent that this is unlikely. Thus half-maximal NADPH oxidation was seen at ∼10 μm NADPH when H2O2 was at 10 mm. A thousand-fold excess of H2O2 thus could not compete with NADPH for the flux of CO 3⨪. It follows that the rate constant for Reaction i must be too low to contribute significantly to the observed H2O2 consumption. SOD (5 mg/ml) was treated with 2 mm H2O2 at pH 7.4, and in the absence of HCO 3− as shown in Fig.6 the rate of reduction, followed in terms of the bleaching of absorbance at 680 nm, was very rapid. Thus half (78 μm) of the SOD was bleached within 10–15 s. Because the rate was declining rapidly within this time interval we estimated that the initial rate of bleaching was 78 μm/5 s = 16 μm/s. To connect this rate to our standard condition of 6.2 μm SOD and 10 mm H2O2 we assume first order dependence and get (16 μm/sec) (6.2/156) (10/2) = 3.2 μm/s. Thus the rate of reduction of the Cu(II) was faster by a factor of 4-fold than the ∼0.8 μm/sec rates of HCO 3−-dependent oxidation of NADPH or of H2O2 consumption. The maximal rates of the reactions studied herein and the relevant second order rate constants are summarized in TableII. It should be pointed out that the reactive form of H2O2 in these reactions is HO 2− (12Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H. Holcman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9967-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the pK a of H2O2 is ∼11.6 (15Everett A.J. Minkoff G.J. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1953; 49: 410-414Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). That being the case the rate constants that involve H2O2 reactions in Table II are apparent rate constants and they are ∼10,000-fold lower than the rate constants that would be calculated on the basis of [HO 2−] rather than upon [H2O2].Table IIRates and rate constantsReactionRate under standard conditionskμm/secm−s−1Reaction a3.250Reaction b+0.813Reaction b−0.7957Reaction d0.0043The parameters for Reaction a were estimated from the initial rate of bleaching of Cu(II), Zn-SOD by H2O2.

The rate of Reaction d was the initial rate of inactivation of the enzyme by H2O2 in the absence of HCO 3−. The rate of Reaction b− was calculated by subtracting the rate of Reaction d from that of Reaction b+. Open table in a new tab The parameters for Reaction a were estimated from the initial rate of bleaching of Cu(II), Zn-SOD by H2O2. The corresponding parameters for Reaction b+ are derived from the maximal rates of HCO 3−-dependent oxidation of NADPH or consumption of H2O2 extrapolated to infinite [HCO 3−]. The rate of Reaction d was the initial rate of inactivation of the enzyme by H2O2 in the absence of HCO 3−. The rate of Reaction b− was calculated by subtracting the rate of Reaction d from that of Reaction b+. Because HCO 3− does not much change the rate of inactivation of Cu,Zn-SOD by H2O2and did not affect the rate of reduction of this enzyme by H2O2 (4Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it cannot be the case that HCO 3− increases the binding of H2O2 as has been suggested (2Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It follows that Reaction b as written in the forward direction is not affected by HCO 3−. We have seen that the rate of inactivation of the enzyme by H2O2 (Reaction d) is only ∼1% as great as the maximal rates of HCO 3−-dependent oxidations and therefore of Reactions b and e. This discrepancy can be explained by introducing the reverse of Reaction b (called Reaction b1) and further assuming that the equilibrium lies to the left such that at equilibrium [E–Cu(I)] ≫ [E–Cu(II)OH]. b+ → E—Cu(I)+H2O2←b−E—Cu(II)OH+OH− REACTIONb1In that case adding HCO 3− would, by decreasing E–Cu(II)OH below its equilibrium concentration, pull Reaction b1 to the right and allow the great increase in H2O2-dependent oxidations. This can be restated and hopefully clarified. Thus at the steady state, the production of Cu(II)OH, i.e.V b+, is equal to its rates of consumption, i.e. to V b− + V d+ V e, where: V b− =k b− [Cu(II)OH][OH−];V d = k d[Cu(II)OH][His]; and V e =k e [Cu(II)OH] [HCO 3−]. When [HCO 3−] approaches ∞V b− and V d will approach zero and the rate of production of CO 3⨪ will approach the rate of Reaction b+. Because we have seen that V b+ is 100-fold greater than V d thenV b− must be ∼0.99 V b+. Hence in the absence of HCO 3− 99% of the bound oxidant disappears by Reaction b−, leaving only 1% to inactivate the enzyme. By lowering [E–Cu (II)OH], HCO 3− might also be expected to prevent the inactivation of the enzyme by Reaction d. But rather than protecting, HCO 3− slightly (∼2-fold) increases the inactivation of the enzyme by H2O2. This is explained by assuming that a small fraction of the CO 3⨪ produced does not leave the active site before oxidizing an essential histidine (Reaction g). The workers who reported protection of the enzyme by HCO 3− (3Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28333-28339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Jewett S.L. Olmsted H.K. Marach J.A. Rojas F. Silva K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were not aware of the HCO 3−-dependent consumption of H2O2 and hence measured inactivation only after long incubation of the enzyme with H2O2. In their experiments HCO 3− appeared to protect because it caused depletion of the H2O2long before the residual activity was measured. The large difference between the rates of inactivation of the enzyme and the V max of HCO 3−-dependent oxidations of NADPH and of urate can also be explained in another way. Thus suppose that ∼1% of the Cu(II)OH produced by Reaction b1goes on to dissociate OH− and thus forms Cu(III) as in Reaction j, which should be ∼100-fold slower thanV b+. Cu(II)OH→Cu(III)+OH− REACTIONjWe could further suppose that Cu(III) was able to attack a liganding histidine while Cu(II)OH could react with HCO 3− but not with the histidine. The Cu(III) could also be responsible for the slow HCO 3−-independent oxidations of urate, formate, and H2O2. This could explain the slowness of those reactions as well as the protective effects of urate and formate (9Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5298Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 12Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H. Holcman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9967-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction b− is really the reduction of the Cu(II)OH by OH−. The postulation of that reaction can be avoided in still another way. Thus suppose the following reactions, in whichV l ≪ V k. E—Cu(I)+H2O2⇄E—Cu(I)H2O2 REACTIONk E—Cu(I)H2O2→Cu(II)OH+OH− REACTIONlIn this case the rapid HCO 3−-dependent oxidations follow the oxidation of HCO 3− byE–Cu(I)H2O2, while the slow HCO 3−- independent inactivation and oxidations depend on E–Cu(II)OH produced by the slow Reaction l. In this case the urate protects by reacting withE–Cu(II)OH in competition with the histidine residue, but is not in competition with HCO 3− forE–Cu(I)H2O2, which rapidly decomposes to E–Cu(I) + H2O2. Having measured rates at known concentrations of reactants we can now calculate apparent second order rate constants. Thus: V = k [R 1] [R 2]. In this case R 1and R 2 denote reactants such as Cu(I)Zn-SOD, Cu(II),Zn-SOD, and H2O2. Table II presents the results of such calculations. For the case of HCO 3−-dependent H2O2 consumption we estimated initial rates by correcting for the concurrent inactivation of the SOD during the period of observation and for the consumption of H2O2during that period. None of these corrections introduced more than a factor of 2.0–2.5 into the calculated rate constant. The rate of production of the bound oxidant Cu(II)OH (V b+) must, in the steady state, equal its rate of consumption by the reverse reaction (V b−) and by the oxidation of an active site histidine (V d). Hence,V b+ = V b− +V d and then V b− =V b+ − V d. If Reaction k actually occurs and not Reaction b1,V l = V d and then the above equation should be replaced by V k− =V k+ − V l. As previously stated the rate of production of the bound oxidant can be equated to the maximal rate of HCO 3−-dependent oxidation of NADPH or consumption of H2O2. In calculatingV b+ and k b+ we take the [Cu(I),Zn-SOD] from the total concentration of SOD even though some fraction of the SOD must remain in the Cu(II) form even in the presence of H2O2. Hence our estimate ofk b+ is a minimal figure. Nevertheless we findk b+ to be ∼100-fold higher than the value reported by Cabelli et al. (12Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H. Holcman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9967-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In their system formate was oxidized by the bound oxidant and the resultant CO 2⨪ reduced nitroblue tetrazolium. This is quite analogous to our use of HCO 3− followed by oxidation of NADPH by CO 3⨪. A possible explanation for the very low rate of Reaction b+ found by Cabelli et al. (12Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H. Holcman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9967-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is that CO 2⨪ did not predominantly escape the active site but rather reduced theE–Cu(II) to E–Cu(I). This reaction is known to occur (16Cabelli D.E. Bielski B.H.J. Rotilio G. in Chemistry, Biology, and Medicine. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 181-183Google Scholar). Our high estimate for the rate of Reaction b+ accounts for the rapid HCO 3−-dependent oxidations reported by Hodgson and Fridovich (1Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), Sankarapandi and Zweier (2Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and in the present work. It has become obvious from the results and discussion presented above that in the absence of HCO 3− no significant oxidant leaves the active site of Cu,Zn-SOD in the presence of H2O2. Hence the assertion that this enzyme catalyzes the production of HO· from H2O2 can be laid to rest."
https://openalex.org/W2017572354,"In human cells, PinX1 protein has recently been shown to regulate telomere length by repressing the telomerase. In this work, we show that the putative yeast homolog of PinX1, encoded by the<i>YGR280c</i> open reading frame (ORF), is a new component of the ribosomal RNA processing machinery. The protein has a KK(E/D) C-terminal domain typical of nucleolar proteins and bears a putative RNA interacting domain widespread in eukaryotes called the G-patch. The protein was hence renamed Gno1p (G-patch nucleolar protein).<i>GNO1</i> deletion results in a large growth defect due to the inhibition of the pre-ribosomal RNA processing first cleavage steps at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, and A<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, Gno1p is involved in the final 3′-end trimming of U18 and U24 small nucleolar RNAs. A mutational analysis showed that the G-patch of Gno1p is essential for both functions, whereas the KK(E/D) repeats are only required for U18 small nucleolar RNA maturation. We found that PinX1 complemented the <i>gno1-</i>Δ mutation, suggesting that it has a dual function in telomere length regulation and ribosomal RNA maturation in agreement with its telomeric and nucleolar localization in human cells. Conversely, we found that Gno1p does not exhibit the <i>in vivo</i> telomerase inhibitor activity of PinX1."

Three of these elements bind transcriptional activating proteins of known identity in fibroblasts. A fourth site, shown previously to be susceptible to single-strand modifying agents in myofibroblasts, was additionally required for enhancer response to TGF-β1.

One of the sites that bind Sp1/3 corresponds to the region of the SmαA enhancer required for TGF-β1 amplification. Additionally, the TGF-β1 receptor-regulated Smad proteins, in particular Smad3, are rate-limiting for SmαA enhancer activation.

Although the molecular control of myofibroblast differentiation is largely unknown, several studies have shown that transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) may be particularly important in their recruitment to sites of tissue inflammatory damage.

TGF-β1 also induces expression of SmαA in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells, bovine aortic endothelial cells, and rat fibroblasts, where specific transcriptional control elements contained within the rat SmαA gene promoter were shown to mediate TGF-β1-dependent activation (16Hautmann M.B.

However, the sequence context and position of DNA-regulatory elements identified in studies on the rat SmαA promoter and aortic smooth muscle cells differed from those in the mouse SmαA enhancer that undergoes TGF-β1-dependent chromatin conformational changes in AKR-2B stromal fibroblasts (15Becker N.A.

These studies resulted in the identification of a minimal enhancer element that was constitutively active in fibroblasts, immature myoblasts, and cultured aortic smooth muscle cells, but not in quiescent, differentiated skeletal muscle myocytes. The aim of the present work was to determine whether the mouse SmαA enhancer also conveyed the TGF-β1 response in fibroblasts and whether sequence elements and transcription factors previously identified as responsible for TGF-β1 inducibility in rat aortic smooth muscle cells also directed this effect in mouse fibroblasts. Our results indicate that TGF-β1 amplifies basal expression of the mouse SmαA enhancer by concerted action at five positive regulatory sites. Interestingly, stoichiometric changes in nuclear protein binding activity at these specific sites were not observed in TGF-β1-activated mouse fibroblasts. Whereas three of these sites bind activating proteins of known identity, proteins interacting with the previously identified TGF-β1 control element (TCE) plus a newly identified TGF-β1 hypersensitivity region (THR) in fibroblasts were determined to be the Sp1 and Sp3 transcriptional regulatory proteins. Our data indicate that both Sp1 and Sp3 can mediate basal expression from both the TCE and THR but convey TGF-β1-inducible expression only at the THR in the mouse SmαA enhancer. A rate-limiting role in the activation of the mouse SmαA enhancer is indicated for the TGF-β1 receptor-regulated Smad proteins previously shown to govern transcription of TGF-β1-dependent genes associated with wound healing and extracellular matrix remodeling in fibroblasts.

Primary cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild-type and Smad3 knockout mice were kindly provided by Dr. X.-F.

All fibroblast preparations were rendered quiescent by a 48-h exposure to HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1.0 g/liter d-glucose), 0.5% FBS, and penicillin-streptomycin. Recombinant human TGF-β1 (2–5 ng/ml, final concentration; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or an equivalent volume of vehicle (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mm HCl) was added to fibroblast cultures for varying periods before preparation of cell extracts for either reporter gene determinations or electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Mithramycin A (0.1–0.8 μm, final concentration; Sigma) was used in some experiments as specified in the figure legends to specifically block Sp1 binding at GC-rich motifs within the SmαA enhancer (30Greenwel P.

Plasmids used for transfections were purified using QiagenTM preparative resin and a protocol provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). In studies using AKR-2B and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, SmαA enhancer:CAT reporter gene fusion plasmids were combined with 5 μg of either pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega, Madison, WI) or pXGH5 (28Seldin R.F.

CAT, β-galactosidase, and human growth hormone assays were performed in triplicate using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. For Sp and Smad protein overexpression studies using high transfection efficiency SL2 and COS7 cells (see below), SmαA:CAT fusion gene output was normalized to total protein rather than output from a secondary β-galactosidase or human growth hormone reporter gene. This was done because direct trans-regulation of the pSV-β-galactosidase and pXGH5 promoters by the overexpressed proteins could compromise their role in monitoring transfection efficiency. For transfection, cells at 50% confluence in 6-well plates first were washed with serum- and antibiotic-free medium. Optimized mixtures of SmαA promoter:reporter fusion plasmids (pC3VSMP4 and pC3VSMP3) and plasmids encoding various transcriptional regulatory proteins (see below) were combined (total plasmid payloads were between 0.5 and 2.5 μg) along with 15 μl of LipofectAMINETM reagent (Invitrogen) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature before applying them to cell monolayer for a 5-h period. After washing out unincorporated DNA, the cells were maintained in complete medium for an additional 36–48 h before harvesting for reporter gene assays as described above. Transfections were routinely performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated three to five times. Mean values for normalized CAT activity (±S.E.) were evaluated by analysis of variance with statistical significance set at p ≤ 0.05. Schneider Drosophila 2 (SL2; kindly provided by Dr. M. Seeger; Ohio State University) cells were grown in Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% FBS. For transfection, replicate preparations of SL2 cells were plated at 50% confluence 1 day before DNA delivery and washed briefly with 2 ml of serum-free Schneider's medium just before transfection. For each transfection, 2 μg of SmαA promoter:reporter fusion plasmid (pC3VSMP3 or pC3VSMP4) plus 4 μg of Sp insect expression plasmid (empty pPAC vector, pPACSp1, and pPACSp3 driven by theDrosophila actin promoter and kindly provided by Dr. G. Suske; University of Marburg) were combined with 9 μl of CellfectinTM reagent (Invitrogen), incubated for 15 min at room temperature, diluted with serum-free medium, and then distributed to SL2 cells. After 20 h, the DNA-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed briefly and incubated with complete growth medium for 48 h before harvesting extracts for CAT assays. Recombinant forms of human Sp1 and Sp3 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Horowitz; North Carolina State University) and the human Smad proteins (kindly provided by Drs. L. Choy and R. Derynck; UCSF) were subcloned into mammalian expression plasmids under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Transversion mutants of the VSM α-actin promoter:CAT reporter fusion constructs pC3VSMP3 and pC3VSMP4 (abbreviated henceforth in this work as VSMP3 or SMP3 and VSMP4 or SMP4) were constructed using PCR amplification or site-directed mutagenesis using a commercial mutagenesis kit (Altered SitesTM; Promega). Custom oligonucleotide primers harboring transversion mutations of nucleotides comprising regulatory elements in VSMP3 and VSMP4 were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Primers were annealed to 0.1–1 μg of template DNA (VSMP4) and amplified for 30–35 cycles in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences DNA ThermacyclerTM using PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) reagents and reaction times (94 °C × 1 min; 50 °C × 2 min; 72 °C × 3 min). PCR products were purified from 1–2% agarose gel slices using Spin-XTM columns (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The promoter construct harboring the MCAT mutation (MCAT-mut) was created by amplifying the VSMP4 insert with a forward primer containing a 5′SalI restriction site and substituting CTTCCGT for the native MCAT site between −182 and −176. The promoter construct harboring the THR mutation (THR-mut) was created by amplifying the VSMP4 insert with a forward primer containing a 5′ SalI restriction site that substitutes CTTA for AGGC between −160 and −157. Mutation of the putative TGF-β1 control element (TCE-mut) was made using a primer that substituted TT for GG at positions −50 and −49 in VSMP4. Promoters harboring the downstream element mutation (DE-mut) were created by amplification with a reverse primer containing a 3′ BamH1 restriction site and substituting AATTTCACAACAA for CCGGGACACCACC between −2 and +11 in both VSMP3 and VSMP4 context. Promoter constructs harboring StuI recognition site substitution mutations in place of CARG-like elements A, B, or D (A-mut, B-mut, and D-mut, respectively) were prepared as described previously (26Stoflet E.S.

EMSA reactions typically contained 5–10 μg of nuclear protein extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.12 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4% glycerol, and 20,000 cpm (5–50 fmol) of 32P-labeled probe in a 10-μl reaction volume. EMSA probes were constructed in native copy number context with the exception of the CARG D oligonucleotide, which contained a dimerized version of the native motif to improve binding affinity. Mutated versions of each EMSA probe contained nucleotide substitutions identical to those contained in the reporter gene counterparts described in the previous section. Oligonucleotide probes were labeled with Klenow enzyme (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biomedical, Costa Mesa, CA), purified by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels, eluted, and ethanol-precipitated before use. EMSA reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before electrophoretic analysis on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer (0.045 m Tris borate and 1 mmEDTA). For competition EMSAs, an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor was added to the reaction before adding protein extract or labeled probe. Antibody supershift EMSAs using commercial Sp1 and Sp3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were performed as described above but included a 20 min preincubation with 2 μl of anti-Sp antibody before the addition of probe. Purified mouse IgG was used as a negative control in antibody supershift experiments. Reaction mixtures containing nuclear extract (100 μg of protein) and biotinylated oligonucleotides (100 pmol; Integrated DNA Technologies) corresponding to the Sp1 consensus site, native TCE site, or mutated TCE site (TCE-mut) were incubated under conditions that mimicked an EMSA reaction. Sp1/Sp3-biotin-DNA complexes were captured on streptavidin-immobilized paramagnetic particles (Promega; 0.6 ml/reaction, 30-min incubation). After washing four times with buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, and 100 mm NaCl, bound protein was eluted using 2× protein denaturation buffer and analyzed by Western blot (22Kelm Jr., R.J.

Eluted protein was processed by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). After overnight blocking at 4 °C in TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 3% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, blots were incubated with anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies for a 60–90-min incubation at ambient temperature with gentle mixing. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:2000 in TBST (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) was then applied for 30–45 min. After washing in TBST, the blot was incubated with VectastainTM reagent for 30 min. Blots were washed four times over a 30-min period and processed for chemiluminescence development for 1 min (ECLTM, reagents; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the immune complexes were visualized on x-ray film (X-Omat; Eastman Kodak) after a 5–10-s exposure. Both antibodies recognized multiple Sp1 and Sp3 isoforms. Northern blot analysis was performed using a SmαA-specific 3′(untranslated region) cDNA probe as described previously (15Becker N.A.

Basal transcription of the native SmαA gene in mouse AKR-2B stromal fibroblasts was minimally enhanced 6-fold up to as much as 20-fold in higher cell density preparations within 6 h of treatment with TGF-β1 (Fig.1 a). To localize sequence elements responsible for TGF-β1 activation, we performed deletion analysis of a 3.6-kb segment of the mouse SmαA promoter (VSMP8) that exhibits correct developmental regulation in transgenic mice. At the low cell density required for efficient transfection, VSMP8 transcription was increased ∼4-fold by TGF-β1, indicating that elements contained within the 5′-flanking/first intronic region mediated growth factor responsiveness (Fig. 1, b andc). A subfragment of the 5′-flanking region, located between −191 and +46 relative to the start of transcription (Fig.1 b), contains a potent core enhancer element previously shown to contain a MCAT motif required for high-level constitutive expression and serum inducibility in stromal fibroblasts (21Foster D.N.

Further 5′ truncation by 41 bp (VSMP5) or 101 bp (VSMP6) completely eliminated basal and TGF-β1-inducible transcriptional activity, indicating that the region of the mouse SmαA promoter between −191 and −150 was minimally required to mediate the TGF-β1 response in fibroblasts (Fig. 1,b and c). Site-specific mutations were created within VSMP4 context to evaluate the relative importance of the known positive elements in mediating TGF-β1 inducibility in fibroblasts. Altered sites included an inverted MCAT motif (AGGAATG, between −182 and −176) and CARG-like elements B and A (CCCTATATGG, between −120 and −111, and CCTTGTTTGG, between −70 and −61) that bind the TEF1 and serum response factor transcriptional activating proteins, respectively. Both sites were required for basal expression of VSMP4 in mouse fibroblasts (24Kelm Jr., R.J. Sun S. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol.

Also included in the analysis was a variant containing a 4-bp transversion (AGGC to CTTA) within a recently described 20-bp subdomain of VSMP4 that exhibited differential reactivity to DNA-modifying agents in the presence and absence of TGF-β1 (15Becker N.A.

This region, located between −170 and −150, is referred to as the THR. A construct containing a mutation within a putative TCE located between −53 and −43, previously identified in the rat SmαA promoter (16Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), was also included in the analysis. Fig.2 shows that all mutations exhibited significantly reduced basal expression relative to native VSMP4. However, all VSMP4 mutants retained TGF-β1 inducibility, except for the construct harboring a THR mutation. Whereas fold induction in the presence of TGF-β1 (relative to that exhibited by native VSMP4) was highest for the construct lacking a functional MCAT element, mutations in the TCE, CARG A, or CARG B motifs all showed approximately the same fold increase. The slight induction exhibited by the THR mutation was not statistically significant (Fig. 2). Thus, with the exception of the THR, mutation of all other activating elements (MCAT, CARG B, CARG A, and TCE) did not fully eliminate the mouse SmαA enhancer responsiveness to TGF-β1 in transfected fibroblasts. EMSAs were performed using extracts prepared from TGF-β1-treated fibroblasts to examine nuclear protein binding to the SmαA enhancer. No net increase in binding activity to the MCAT, CARG B, CARG A, and TCE probes was observed after treatment with TGF-β1 (data not shown). Protein binding specificity was confirmed by competition with unlabeled excess DNA (see below). In the mouse SmαA enhancer, CARG B was previously shown to bind serum response factor (26Stoflet E.S.

https://openalex.org/W2040571306,"The murine class B, type I scavenger receptor mSR-BI is a high and low density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL) receptor that mediates selective uptake of cholesteryl esters. Here we describe a reconstituted phospholipid/cholesterol liposome assay of the binding and selective uptake activities of SR-BI derived from detergent-solubilized cells. The assay, employing lysates from epitope-tagged receptor (mSR-BI-t1)-expressing mammalian and insect cells, recapitulated many features of SR-BI activity in intact cells, including high affinity and saturable (125)I-HDL binding, selective lipid uptake from [(3)H]cholesteryl ether-labeled HDL, and poor inhibition of HDL receptor activity by LDL. The novel properties of a mutated receptor (Q402R/Q418R, normal LDL binding but loss of most HDL binding) were reproduced in the assay, as was the ability of the SR-BI homologue CD36 to bind HDL but not mediate efficient lipid uptake. In this assay, essentially homogeneously pure mSR-BI-t1, prepared by single-step immunoaffinity chromatography, mediated high affinity HDL binding and efficient selective lipid uptake from HDL. Thus, SR-BI-mediated HDL binding and selective lipid uptake are intrinsic properties of the receptor that do not require the intervention of other proteins or specific cellular structures or compartments."

In mitochondria and various bacteria, electron transfer from NADH to Q by complex I is coupled to the translocation of protons across the membrane. It is generally assumed that the stoichiometry of this process is at least 2H+/e−. The mitochondrial NADH:Q oxidoreductase is a large and complex enzyme composed of more than 40 unlike polypeptides. Of these, seven are encoded by mitochondrial DNA (6Walker J.E. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) building the membrane part of the enzyme. The redox active centers that participate in the electron transfer reactions are one non-covalently bound FMN in the peripheral, NADH-oxidizing part and at least six iron-sulfur clusters (7Yano T. Ohnishi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Finel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In bacteria like Escherichia coli, a simpler form of the enzyme exists composed of only 14 homologues of the mammalian subunits summing up to a molecular mass of ∼530 kDa. It is regarded as the minimal catalytic structure of the proton-pumping NADH:Q oxidoreductase. E. coli complex I consists of two arms, which may be arranged perpendicular to each other or side by side (9Bo¨ttcher B. Scheide D. Hesterberg M. Nagel-Steger L. Friedrich T. J. Biol.

Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It seems that the electrons originating from NADH are transferred from the iron-sulfur cluster N2 to the final electron acceptor Q located in the membrane (11Dutton P.L. Moser C.C. Sled V.D.

This exergonic reaction is coupled to the transport of H+ (or Na+) across the membrane (14Steuber J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Klebsiella pneumoniae, a close relative of E. coli, possesses a respiratory NADH:Q oxidoreductase that was shown to be stimulated by Na+ ions (15Dimroth P. Thomer A. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 151: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Inhibitor studies in native membranes and partial purification of the enzyme led to the proposal that this respiratory enzyme is of the complex I (NDH I) type (16Krebs W. Steuber J. Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sequencing studies revealed that 84% of the amino acids of complex I from K. pneumoniae and E. coli are identical (14Steuber J. J. Bioenerg.

Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It was not surprising therefore that our preliminary evidences with bacterial membrane vesicles and complex I-specific inhibitors indicated that the NADH:Q oxidoreductase fromK. pneumoniae or E. coli, which we tentatively ascribed to complex I catalyzed Na+ transport (16Krebs W.

Up to now, the purification and reconstitution of a eukaryotic or bacterial complex I in an active state, which allows the determination of H+ (or Na+) transport stoichiometries, have not been reported. In this study we report purification of NADH:Q oxidoreductase fromK. pneumoniae with retention of the Q reduction and Na+ transport activities. Inhibition studies, cofactor analysis, and results from N-terminal sequencing are all consistent with the identity of the enriched enzyme with complex I. For the first time, transport by complex I has been studied in artificial membranes. It is shown here that the enzyme transports Na+ and that the transport stoichiometry is one Na+ translocated per electron transferred. Klebsiella pneumoniaefrom laboratory stock culture was grown anaerobically at 37 °C as described (19Dimroth P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 530-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with 46 mm glycerol as carbon source. Cells of K. pneumoniae (50 g wet weight) were resuspended in 50 ml of air-saturated buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl) containing 7% dimethylsulfoxide immediately after harvesting. The cell suspension was stored for less than 72 h at −20 °C. Using dimethylsulfoxide as antifreezing protectant, the NADH:Q oxidoreductase activities were as high as in fresh cells. After adding 0.1 mmdiisopropylfluorophosphate and a trace of DNase, the suspension was passed once through a French pressure cell at 83 mPa, and the eluate was collected under a stream of N2. Unbroken cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 35,000 ×g for 20 min. If not indicated otherwise, all subsequent manipulations were performed in an anaerobic chamber with N2/H2 (95:5%) as gas phase and at 4 °C. The membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (150,000 ×g, 1 h) and were washed once with 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl and 10% glycerol. Membranes isolated by this procedure contained ∼20-fold higher NADH-driven Na+ uptake activities than after preparation under air. Most probably, exposure of the NADH:Q oxidoreductase to air resulted in oxidative damage of its redox cofactor(s), as was recently shown for the iron-sulfur cluster 1c of complex I from Thermus thermophilus (20Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yano T. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1680-1688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The NADH:Q oxidoreductase was solubilized by stirring a suspension of membranes (2000 mg of protein) in 30 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 15 mm DHPC1 or 2.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice in sealed vessels. Some loss of NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity (20%) was observed upon solubilization with Triton X-100, which is known to act as competitive inhibitor of eukaryotic complex I (21Ushakova A.V.

After centrifugation at 250,000 ×g for 1 h the dark yellow supernatant was loaded onto a Fractogel TSK DEAE-650 column (Amersham Biosciences, 1.5 × 8.5 mm). Anoxic buffers were connected to the FPLC system under an overpressure of N2, and fractions eluting from the column were collected under a stream of N2. After washing the column with 3 volumes of buffer A (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing either 1 mm DHPC or 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 200–360 mmNaCl in buffer A with the detergent (total volume, 45 ml) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. When DHPC was used as detergent its concentration was increased to 1.5 mm (cmc = 1.5 mm) (23Tausk R.J.M. Karmiggelt J. Oudshoorn C. Overbeek J.T.G. Biophys. Chem. 1974; 1: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) immediately after elution of the enzyme. Subsequently, the enzyme (9 ml) was concentrated by ultracentrifugation (150,000 ×g, 15 h). The dark yellow pellet was resuspended in 0.45 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl, and each 0.15-ml aliquot was applied to a gradient from 5 to 20% sucrose in 4.6 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl and 1.5 mm DHPC or 0.1% Triton X-100. After ultracentrifugation (150,000 ×g, 8 h, Beckman SW55Ti), fractions (0.2 ml) were collected from the top. The Q reductase activity was enriched at 12–14% sucrose, which also has been reported for E. colicomplex I (24Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). No disruption of the enzyme complex into a NADH dehydrogenase fragment and a NADH:Q oxidoreductase was observed. Active fractions were combined (2 ml) and concentrated to 40–100 μl (30–40 mg of protein ml−1). In some purifications all buffers contained KCl instead of NaCl, which reduced the endogenous Na+ concentration of the enzyme to 30–50 μm. E. coli lipids (30–150 mg) were dissolved in 1–4 ml pf CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) in a round bottom flask, and the solvent was removed on a rotor evaporator. When electron transfer to membrane-bound quinones was measured, the lipid solution was mixed with 600 nmol of Q2 (Sigma), 350 nmol of Q6 (Sigma), and 2 μmol of Q8 dissolved in 80 μl of diethylether. The NADH:Q oxidoreductase from different purification steps in DHPC was added dropwise to the lipid film (ratio of lipid/protein, 30; total volume, ∼1–4 ml), and the lipids were dispersed by vortexing for 1 min. The reconstitution of the artificial membrane system was accomplished by dropwise addition (30 drops min−1) of 5–15 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl. The proteoliposomes formed by diluting the DHPC concentration below the cmc were collected by ultracentrifugation (150,000 × g, 30 min) and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl and 10% glycerol. Alternatively, 50 mmpotassium phosphate pH 7.5 was used as buffer. These proteoliposomes contained 5 mg protein ml−1 and 0.8–1 mm of quinones. It should be noted that the E. coli lipids contain also endogenous quinones and therefore reconstituted NADH:Q oxidoreductase catalyzes NADH-dependent Q reduction and Na+ transport even without added quinones. Na+uptake was followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (16Krebs W. Steuber J. Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Incubation mixtures contained in 0.3 ml at room temperature: the reconstituted proteoliposomes (0.1 mg of protein), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm NaCl. If indicated CCCP (10 μm or 100 μm), annonin VI (50 μm), monensin (20 μm), valinomycin (50 μm), or gramicidin (90 μg ml−1; mixture of gramicidin A, B, and C; Fluka) was added to the assay. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 mm NADH (final concentration). At different times, samples of 70 μl were applied to a 1-ml plastic syringe containing 0.6 ml of Dowex 50 (K+), equilibrated with assay buffer without NaCl. The outlet of the syringe was sealed with a HDPE membrane (high-pressure polyethylene, 0.35-μm pore diameter, Reichelt Chemietechnik, Heidelberg, FRG). The proteoliposomes were immediately eluted with 0.8 ml of deionized water that was quickly pressed through the Dowex material using the piston of the syringe (total handling time, <1 s). The eluate was collected in plastic tubes, and the Na+ entrapped in the vesicles was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. In controls performed with substrate and 5 mm NaCl in buffer in the absence of membrane vesicles, Na+ was completely absorbed to the Dowex columns. Blank values obtained with vesicles in buffer without NADH added corresponded to the internal Na+ content of the liposomes (3–8 nmol of Na+ per sample after passage through the Dowex column). Parallel experiments performed with 5 mm NaCl and analysis by atomic absorption spectroscopy or 5 mm22NaCl (1000 cpm/nmol) and analysis by γ-counting (19Dimroth P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 530-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) yielded identical rates of NADH-driven Na+ uptake. The rates of Na+ transport varied by less than 10% with different preparations of complex I. Protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using the reagent obtained from Pierce, or by the microbiuret method (25Goa J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1953; 5: 219-222Crossref Scopus (798) Google Scholar) after trichloroacetic acid/deoxycholate precipitation (26Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). In the presence of detergents, this method gives more reliable values than the bicinchoninic acid method. Bovine serum albumin served as standard. SDS-PAGE was performed with 10% polyacrylamide according to Ref. 27Scha¨gger H. Jagow G.v. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar. Enzyme assays were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 with 50 μm to 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm NADH or deamino-NADH, and 0.1 mm Q1 (Sigma) at 25 °C. The NADH or deamino-NADH oxidation was followed at 340 nm (ε340 = 6.22 mm−1cm−1). The Q reductase activity corresponding to the formation of ubiquinol-1 from Q1 was determined from the difference in absorbance at the wavelength pair 248 and 268 nm (Δε248−268 = 7.8 mm−1cm−1) (28Tokuda, H., and Kogure, K. (1989) J. Gen. Microbiol.703–709Google Scholar). The reduction of ferricyanide with NADH or deamino-NADH as electron donor was followed at 420 nm (ε420 = 1 mm−1cm−1). 1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme consuming 1 μmol of substrate or forming 1 μmol of product per minute. In order to study the inhibition of the NADH:Q oxidoreductase by Ag+, buffers containing sulfate instead of chloride were used for the isolation of complex I and the subsequent incubations with AgNO3 (29Steuber J. Krebs W. Dimroth P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Iron was determined colorimetrically using 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis-(5-sulfo-2-furyl)-1,2,4-triazine, disodium salt as iron chelator (30Pierik A.J. Wolbert R.B.G. Mutsaers P.H.A. Hagen W.R. Veeger C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Acid-labile sulfur was determined according to (31Cline J.D. Limnol. Oceanogr. 1969; 14: 454-458Crossref Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were determined as phosphate concentrations according to (32Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flavins from protein samples were extracted under light protection by adding 20% trichloroacetic acid in water. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation and the solution neutralized by addition of one-fourth of its volume of 4 mK2HPO4. Flavins were separated on a C18 reversed phase column (ODS Hypersil C18, 5 μm, 250 × 4 mm, Hewlett Packard) connected to a Dionex HPLC system. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min for 8 min with 1% (v/v) methanol in 0.05 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) followed by a linear gradient of 1–50% (v/v) methanol in 0.05m sodium acetate for 22 min and a linear gradient of 50% methanol in 0.05 m sodium acetate to 100% methanol for 10 min. Standard solutions contained 5–40 pmol of FMN, 10–180 pmol of FAD, and 5–30 pmol of riboflavin. A fluorescence detector was used for detection (excitation wavelength, 450 nm; emission wavelength, 525 nm). FAD eluted at 24 min, FMN at 26 min, and riboflavin at 28 min. Quinones were separated by HPLC and identified by subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. 5–10 mg of NADH:Q oxidoreductase (100–200 μl) from various purification steps was extracted with 1.2 ml methanol and 1.5 ml petroleum ether (boiling point, 40–60 °C). The mixture was shaken vigorously and centrifuged to separate the two layers. The upper layer was removed and combined with that from a second extraction with 1.2 ml of petroleum ether. After adding 0.6 ml of 98% ethanol, the solvent was evaporated under a stream of N2. The light-yellow pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of methanol, and 90 μl were loaded onto a C18 reversed-phase column (5 μm, 250 × 4 mm) connected to a HPLC system. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min in 100% (v/v) methanol for 35 min and the absorbance monitored at 293 nm. The Q6 and Q8 standards eluted at 6 and 14–15 min, respectively. In order to verify the presence of Q6 and Q8 in the NADH:Q oxidoreductase, peak fractions eluting at 6 or 14–15 min were concentrated and subjected to MALDI. Calculated masses are C39H58O4 (Q6): [M+H+] = 591.8 (found 591.5); C49H75O4(Q8): [M+Na+] = 750.1 (found 750.5). In order to compare the initial rates of Na+ transport and Q reductase activities by proteoliposomes containing NADH:Q oxidoreductase, both types of experiments were performed under identical conditions using a single batch of the reconstituted enzyme. Initial rates of NADH oxidation, Q reduction, and Na+ transport were determined in reaction mixtures containing in 0.3 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm NADH, and 5 mm NaCl and proteoliposomes (0.1 mg of protein). All assays were performed at 15 °C, since the initial rate of Na+transport was underestimated at higher temperatures. The ratio of Na+ transported per Q reduced was calculated as the quotient of the corresponding initial rates. The NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity was purified from K. pneumoniae cells grown anaerobically on glycerol (Table I). The specific activities for deamino-NADH oxidation, Q1 reduction, and Na+ translocation increased in parallel during purification to yield values of 2.6 units mg−1, 2.4 units mg−1, and 4.7 units mg−1, respectively, for the enzyme reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Deamino-NADH was used as substrate in these experiments because this is specific for complex I. Whereas in membranes the NADH dehydrogenase activity was twice as high as the deamino-NADH dehydrogenase activity, both substrates were oxidized under formation of quinol with almost equal rates with enzyme from the final sucrose density centrifugation step, indicating that NADH dehydrogenases that do not oxidize deamino-NADH were removed during the purification (Table I). With the purified enzyme, the specific Na+ transport activity was roughly twice as high as the Q reductase activity, which implies a Na+ to electron stoichiometry of 1 (see below). In detergent micelles, NADH oxidation, and Q reduction activities were lower than after reconstitution into proteoliposomes, which suggests a favorable effect of the lipid environment on the activity of the enzyme. NADH dehydrogenase and Q reductase activity of the reconstituted enzyme reached similar values indicating that the enzyme is coupled.Table IPurification of the NADH:Q oxidoreductase from Klebsiella pneumoniaeProteindNADH oxidationNADH oxidationQ1 reductionQ1 reduction after reconstitutionYield Q1 reductionNa+ translocationYield Na+translocationmgunits mg−1units mg−1units mg−1units mg−1%units mg−1%Membrane fraction20000.4 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.30.1 ± 0.030.1 ± 0.031000.2 ± 0.03100Solubilized membranes5300.4 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.30.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.1530.3 ± 0.140Fractogel TSK1301.1 ± 0.41.0 ± 0.40.4 ± 0.2nd1-and, not determined.ndndndSucrose density-gradient402.0 ± 1.12.0 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.72.4 ± 1.3484.7 ± 1.647Starting material was 50 g (wet weight) cells.

The values represent at least four measurements Analysis of cofactors present in complex I (NDH I), in the non-coupled NDH II, or in the Na+-NQR of the type found in Vibrio sp., were performed at each purification stage of the Na+-translocating NADH:Q oxidoreductase from K. pneumoniae (Table II). Cofactors typical for complex I (FMN, iron, and S2−) increased, while the content of FAD typically found in NDH II or the Na+-NQR decreased to substoichiometric amounts upon purification of the enzyme. Assuming that pure complex I with a molecular mass of 530 kDa was analyzed (14Steuber J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the data correspond to 0.5 mol of FMN, 17 mol of S2−, and 13 mol of iron mol−1 and indicate that our preparation contains complex I with 50% purity. The NADH:Q oxidoreductase also contained Q6 (1.20 + 0.15 nmol of Q6 mg−1) and Q8 (1.5 + 0.2 nmol of Q8 mg−1) in near stoichiometric amounts. The results obtained by HPLC analysis were confirmed by mass spectrometry of the extracted quinones (not shown). These quinones were copurified with the enzyme, not with the adhering phospholipids, because the content of phospholipids per mg of protein decreased, while the content of both quinones per mg of protein increased compared with the membranes (TableII). In summary, our enzyme preparation contained the typical cofactors of complex I (FMN, iron, and acid-labile sulfide) in ratios that are characteristic for this complex. These findings strongly suggest that our purified enzyme is identical with complex I. Our data also imply that Q6 and Q8 are cofactors of complex I from K. pneumoniae. In vivo studies indicate that ubiquinone or menaquinone act as substrates for the related complex I from E. coli during aerobic or anaerobic respiration, respectively (33Unden G. Achenbach S. Holighaus G. Tran H.-Q. Wackwitz B. Zeuner Y. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 263-268Google Scholar). Most likely, the situation is similar in K. pneumoniae, which similar toE. coli contains ubiquinone, demethylmenaquinone, and menaquinone (34Whistance G.R. Dillon J.F. Threlfall D.R. Biochem.

Upon separation by SDS-PAGE, two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 100 and 50 kDa were identified as the NuoG subunit (MATIHVDGKEYEV) and the FMN-carrying NuoF subunit (MKNVIRTAETHPLT) of complex I (Fig. 1). The N-terminal sequences of the NuoF and the NuoG subunits are identical to the sequences derived from the nuoF and nuoG genes of complex I from K. pneumoniae (14Steuber J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Krebs W. Steuber J. Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Note that there is only one nuo operon on the genome of K. pneumoniae (17McClelland M. Sanderson K.E. Spieth J. Clifton S.W. Latreille P. Coutney L. Porwollik S. Ali J. Dante M., Du, F. Hou S. Layman D. Leonard S. Nguyen C. Scott K. Holmes A. Grewal N. Mulvaney E. Ryan E. Sun H. Florea L. Miller W. Stoneking T. Nhan M. Waterston R. Wilson R.K. Nature. 2001; 413: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar), which excludes the possibility that K. pneumoniae possesses a Na+-dependent complex I in addition to a H+-dependent one. The SDS-PAGE of complex I from K. pneumoniae reveals a polypeptide pattern that is very similar to the one observed in the related complex I from E. coli (3Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and allows the putative assignment of the fused NuoCD subunit (68 kDa), and the NuoM and NuoN subunits (42–45 kDa) in complex I from K. pneumoniae (Fig. 1). A comparison of the initial rates of Q reduction and Na+ transport allows an estimation of the Na+/electron stoichiometry of redox-driven Na+transport by complex I, if the redox pump works in a fully coupled manner. Uncoupled quinol formation, e.g. reduction of Q not linked to Na+ transport, would result in an underestimation of the actual Na+/electron ratio. We determined the stimulation of Q reductase activity of complex I by Na+ions using an enzyme preparation that contained little endogenous Na+. Essentially no Q reduction occurred in the absence of Na+ ions (Fig. 2), which is reminiscent of other primary sodium pumps (35Dimroth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 11-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).The addition of Na+ resulted in a drastic increase of the Q reductase activity of complex I. The Na+ activation profile exhibited a sigmoid shape, indicating cooperative binding of Na+ to complex I. The experimental data were fitted using the Hill equation with a root mean square deviation of R2 = 0.990 (Fig. 2,upper panel). The calculated Vmax was 1.03 units mg−1, and the apparent half maximalK0.5 was 332 μm Na+. Note that the residual Na+ concentration in the assay was 50 μm. The Hill coefficient was calculated as slope of the corresponding plot in linear coordinates (Fig. 2, lower panel). A Hill coefficient of 1.96 was obtained, indicating that at least two Na+ ions bind to complex I in a positively cooperative manner. Inhibitors were used to differentiate between complex I and the Na+-translocating NADH:Q oxidoreductase of the NQR-type from Vibrio. The NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity of native membranes from K. pneumoniae was completely inhibited with the complex I-specific inhibito"

The discovery of YidC has inspired the reevaluation of membrane protein assembly pathways in E. coli. In this study, we have analyzed the role of YidC in membrane integration of a widely used model IMP, leader peptidase (Lep). Site-directed photocross-linking experiments demonstrate that both YidC and SecY contact nascent Lep very early during biogenesis, at only 50-amino acid nascent chain length. At this length the first transmembrane domain (TM), which acquires a type I topology, is not even fully exposed outside the ribosome. The pattern of interactions appears dependent on the position of the cross-linking probe in the nascent chain. Upon elongation, nascent Lep remains close to YidC and comes into contact with lipids as well. Our results suggest a role for YidC in both the reception and lipid partitioning of type I TMs. YidC has been identified recently as an evolutionary conserved factor that is involved in the integration of inner membrane proteins (IMPs) in Escherichia coli.

Bochkareva E.S. Bibi E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In vitro cross-linking andin vivo depletion studies suggest that at least a subset of IMPs inserts at the Sec translocon (2de Gier J.-W.L. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The Sec translocon was originally identified as the protein-conducting pore that receives and translocates secretory proteins. The core translocon consists of the integral IMPs SecY, SecE, and SecG, which constitute an oligomeric complex that is homologous to the Sec61 channel complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (3Manting E.H. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The peripheral membrane ATPase SecA is translocon-associated and functions as the molecular motor that drives the translocation of secretory proteins and of large periplasmic loops of IMPs through the translocon (4Beck K., Wu, L.F. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B.

Recently, the 60-kDa IMP YidC was identified as a novel translocon-associated component that plays an important role in the biogenesis of IMPs. YidC interacts with the TMs of Sec-dependent IMPs during insertion (4Beck K., Wu, L.F. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Scotti P.A.

Depletion of YidC affects both Sec-dependent and Sec-independent membrane protein insertion (8Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 9Samuelson J.C. Jiang F., Yi, L. Chen M. de Gier J.-W.L. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, YidC has homologues in both chloroplasts (Alb3) and in mitochondria (Oxa1p) that have been implicated in Sec-independent membrane insertion mechanisms (10Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.-W.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 1: 1-5Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it has been suggested that the role of YidC in membrane protein biogenesis might be both in conjunction with and independent of the Sec translocon. In the present study we investigated in detail the initial interactions of the IMP Lep during membrane insertion. The first TM of Lep (H1) has a type I topology in the native protein and is thought to insert independent of the Sec translocon (12Lee J.-I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 938-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that H1 interacts with YidC, SecY, SecE, and SecA very early in the insertion process even when H1 is not fully exposed outside the ribosome. The precise pattern of interactions appeared dependent on the position of the cross-linking probe in the nascent chain, suggesting an ordered insertion into an oligomeric YidC/Sec structure. These interactions were dependent on the context of the ribosome. Upon prolongation of the nascent chains, interactions with YidC persisted, whereas interactions with SecY and SecE were diminished. Together the results suggest a prominent role for YidC during membrane insertion of Lep starting very early in biogenesis.

Carbonate-insoluble fractions were either analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging or first immunoprecipitated as described previously (16Luirink J. High S. Wood H. Giner A. Tollervey D.

To monitor membrane association, ribosome nascent chain complexes and IMVs were collected by centrifugation through a 100-μl sucrose cushion (0.5 m sucrose in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 500 mm KOAc, 5 mmMg(OAc)2) for 30 min at 90,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA100 rotor at 4 °C.

Lep, the major signal peptidase in E. coli, was used as a model protein to investigate the earliest stages of IMP insertion in vitro. Lep spans the membrane twice with a short translocated N-tail and a large translocated C-terminal catalytic domain (P2) (Fig. 1 A). Lep has been shown to interact with SRP in vitro (18Valent Q.A. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and to depend on SRP for efficient targeting to the inner membrane in vivo(19de Gier J.-W.L. Mansournia P. Valent Q.A. Phillips G.J. Luirink J. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nascent Lep with a length of 100 amino acids (100Lep), in which H1 is well exposed out of the ribosome, has been shown to insert into the membrane in a carbonate-resistant conformation close to SecY, SecA, and YidC (6Houben E.N.G. Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Brunner J. de Gier J.-W.L. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To investigate the membrane insertion of Lep as a function of chain length, the nature and order of interactions of H1 in the membrane were probed by site-specific photocross-linking using nascent Lep of different lengths. The insertion intermediates were generated byin vitro translation of truncated mRNA in a homologous cell-free translation system in the presence of inverted IMVs to allow co-translational targeting. The nascent chains were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine. Through the addition of (Tmd)Phe-tRNASup during the translation reaction, the photoreactive Tmd probe is incorporated into the nascent chain during biosynthesis by suppression of a specifically introduced TAG codon. Lep nascent chains of 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 amino acids were prepared containing a TAG codon at position 10 in the H1 coding region (Fig. 1 B) and a C-terminal 4× methionine tag to increase the labeling efficiency. The TAG10 mutations were all efficiently suppressed by (Tmd)Phe-tRNASup resulting in nascent Lep of the expected molecular mass (not shown). Following a targeting/insertion reaction using wild-type IMVs, one half of each sample was irradiated with UV light to induce cross-linking, whereas the other half was kept in the dark to serve as a control (Fig.2 A). The shortest construct, 40Lep, generated no cross-linking products (Fig. 2 A,lane 8). Assuming that the ribosome covers ∼35 residues, the cross-linking probe is located in the ribosomal tunnel and quenched in this aqueous environment. In contrast, 50Lep, in which H1 is almost fully exposed, gave rise to one major cross-linking product of ∼68 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 9). Immunoprecipitation identified YidC as the cross-linking partner (Fig. 2 B,lane 2). Apparently, H1 is able to contact YidC even when it is not fully exposed outside the ribosome. 60- and 70Lep also showed a YidC cross-linking adduct of which the molecular weight increased with increasing nascent chain length (Fig. 2 A, lanes 10 and 11). 80-, 90-, and 100Lep revealed slightly faster migrating cross-linking products (Fig. 2 A,lanes 12–14), which could also be immunoprecipitated using YidC antiserum (Fig. 2 B, lane 4 and data not shown). These products might contain a different conformation of YidC or might represent cross-linking of nascent Lep to different parts of YidC. In addition, a weak ∼100-kDa cross-linking adduct was detected, most prominent with 60Lep and 70Lep (Fig. 2 A, lanes 10 and 11). This adduct could not be immunoprecipitated using antibodies against SecA (102 kDa) and remains to be identified. In contrast to the longer constructs, 40Lep and 50Lep showed the same low carbonate resistance (Fig. 2 C). 50Lep, however, was still found to be associated with inner membranes upon flotation under high salt buffer conditions, whereas flotation of 40Lep was not observed under these conditions (data not shown). These findings indicate that at the length of 50 amino acids, Lep starts to specifically contact the inner membrane integration site. To investigate the possibility of interactions of nascent Lep with lipids, cross-linked samples were also analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE for a better resolution in the lower molecular weight area (Fig.2 D). Indeed, cross-linking adducts were identified that migrated slightly slower than the non-cross-linked nascent chains of 70 amino acids and longer. The adducts were not detected after phospholipase treatment of the cross-linked samples, confirming that they represent cross-linking to lipids (shown for 70Lep in Fig.2 D, lanes 15 and 16). Together the data suggest that nascent Lep inserts into the inner membrane very early during biosynthesis close to YidC, even before H1 is fully exposed and the nascent chains have acquired significant carbonate resistance. H1 remains in contact with YidC upon elongation of the nascent chains and acquires contact with lipids concomitant with an increased carbonate resistance. Nascent Lep contacts YidC from amino acid position 10 in H1 when it has reached a length of 50 amino acids (see “Lep H1 Interacts with YidC from the Initial Insertion Step”). To investigate the molecular interactions of the entire H1 at this early insertion stage, a scanning photocross-linking experiment was carried out. TAG codons were introduced at positions 3, 9–16, and 21 in 50Lep (Fig.3 A). 50Lep nascent chains that carry Tmd(Phe)s at the indicated positions were prepared in the presence of IMVs (Fig. 3 B). Upon UV irradiation, characteristic and reproducible cross-linking patterns were observed (Fig. 3 B, lanes 11–20). Not only the ∼68-kDa YidC cross-linking adduct was detected but also a ∼45-kDa cross-linking product appeared. This cross-linking product could be immunoprecipitated using SecY antiserum (Fig. 3 C,lanes 3 and 9, and data not shown). The SecY cross-links were most abundant with the photocross-linking probe at positions 12–16 (for quantifications, see Fig. 3 D), whereas YidC was found to cross-link only weakly to this region. These data suggest that insertion of Lep H1 takes place at an SecY-YidC interface. Furthermore on UV irradiation of 50LepTAG14 and 50LepTAG15, a prominent band appeared that migrated slightly faster than the non-irradiated nascent chains (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7 and 8 versus 17 and 18; indicated by anarrow). Possibly, nascent 50Lep bends as a hairpin near these positions giving rise to internal cross-links. This might cause a more compact structure that withstands complete unfolding in SDS resulting in faster migration in SDS-PAGE (20Heinrich S.U. Mothes W. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, at amino acid position 21, only 29 amino acids from the peptidyltransferase center SecY were still cross-linked (Fig.3 B, lane 20). This indicates a close contact between the ribosome and the Sec translocon. In contrast to the Tmd(Phe)s at positions 12–16 and 21, the cross-linking probes at positions 10 and 11 cross-linked more efficiently to YidC, whereas SecY cross-linked significantly at position 9 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 12–14; quantified in Fig. 3 D). The periodic pattern of SecY and YidC cross-linking at positions 9–12 might indicate that this region of H1 is structured and situated in between SecY and YidC. YidC was most efficiently cross-linked at position 3, which is located just upstream from H1 (Fig. 3 B, lane 11). Interestingly, weak cross-linking to SecA was also observed at this position as identified by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3 B,lane 11 and Fig. 3 C, lanes 2 and6). A weak ∼25-kDa cross-linking product was detected at several positions, which could be immunoprecipitated using SecY antiserum (Fig.3 C, lanes 3 and 9, indicated byX-SecY*, and data not shown). This product most probably represents a breakdown product of SecY as observed previously (5Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 7Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Fröderberg L. Sääf A. de Gier J.-W.L. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 6: 524-529Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Using 50LepTAG9, -12, and -15, a small portion of the ∼25-kDa product could also be immunoprecipitated using antiserum raised against SecE roughly consistent with the combined molecular mass of 50Lep (∼6 kDa) and SecE (∼14 kDa) (Fig. 3 C, lane 10and data not shown). However, no SecE cross-links could be identified with the cross-linker at position 3 (Fig. 3 C, lane 4). In summary, the scanning photocross-linking of 50Lep suggests that H1 inserts into the membrane close to not only YidC but also to SecY and to a lesser extent, SecE and SecA. Contacts with these translocon components occur from different positions in H1. The N-terminal region appears close to both YidC and SecY, whereas the C-terminal region is more exclusively in contact with SecY. Membrane-targeted 50Lep was found close to SecY and YidC, possibly in a hairpin conformation as described previously. Next, we investigated whether the context of the ribosome is required for these interactions using 50LepTAG10 (strong YidC cross-linking) and 50LepTAG14 (strong SecY cross-linking). After the translation/insertion reaction in the presence of IMVs, one fourth of each sample was treated with either puromycin (with or without high salt) or EDTA. These treatments provoke the release of the nascent chains from the ribosome in different ways. Puromycin breaks the tRNA bond, whereas EDTA disassembles ribosomes. High salt treatment extracts “empty” ribosomes from the membrane (Fig. 4). Upon UV irradiation, 50LepTAG10 and 50LepTAG14 were found to be cross-linked strongly to YidC (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5and 9) and to SecY (Fig. 4 B, lane 5), respectively, whereas to the latter construct YidC cross-linking was inefficient (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). After the puromycin treatment the YidC and SecY cross-links were severely reduced, and unexpectedly, another cross-linking product of ∼62 kDa appeared (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 6). Treatment with puromycin in combination with high salt or treatment with EDTA resulted in an almost complete loss of YidC and SecY cross-linking. The ∼62-kDa cross-linking product appeared even more intense under these conditions. This product could not be immunoprecipitated using YidC antiserum (Fig. 4 A, lane 10) and did not disappear when using IMVs from a YidC-depleted strain (data not shown). These findings suggest the transfer of the nascent chains (∼6 kDa) upon release from the ribosome from YidC and SecY to an ∼56-kDa component. The carbonate resistance of the non-irradiated nascent chains increased drastically upon all treatments (Fig. 4, C andD). Furthermore, the same percentage of nascent chains was found to be associated with membranes following puromycin treatment and flotation centrifugation under high salt buffer conditions (data not shown). This suggests that the released nascent chains do not aggregate but integrate more efficiently into the lipid bilayer. Together, these results indicate that the interactions of nascent Lep with SecY and YidC require the context of the ribosome. Upon release from the ribosome, the nascent chains apparently move from the SecYEG/YidC translocon toward a novel, unidentified ∼56-kDa protein and probably into the lipid bilayer. Identification of this novel cross-linking partner will be a topic for further studies. Previously, the functional reconstitution of SecYEG and YidC into proteoliposomes has been reported (15van der Laan M. Houben E.N.G. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 21: 519-523Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Using the model IMP FtsQ, it was shown that shorter nascent chains interact with SecY, whereas longer nascent chains interact with YidC, but only when SecYEG was co-reconstituted with YidC. This is consistent with the sequential interaction of nascent FtsQ in IMVs, first with SecY and then with YidC (7Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Fröderberg L. Sääf A. de Gier J.-W.L. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 6: 524-529Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To study which of the membrane components are required for the membrane interactions of Lep, which has a different membrane topology, we investigated the interactions of nascent Lep species in proteoliposomes. 50LepTAG10 (strong YidC cross-linking in IMVs), 100LepTAG10 (strong YidC cross-linking), and 50LepTAG15 (strong SecY cross-linking) were translated in the presence of proteoliposomes containing either SecYEG, YidC, or a combination of SecYEG and YidC (Fig.5). The samples were UV-irradiated, carbonate-extracted, and analyzed. The cross-linking patterns in IMVs serve as a control (Fig. 5, lanes 1, 8, and15). In all samples a cross-linking adduct was observed that could be immunoprecipitated using antiserum against Ffh, the protein component of the SRP (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 13). This product resulted from the addition of extra SRP to improve the targeting efficiency. 50LepTAG10 yielded two cross-linking adducts of ∼68 kDa in SecYEG/YidC proteoliposomes that were both immunoprecipitated with YidC antiserum, albeit with different efficiencies (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 7). The difference in mobility of the YidC adducts, as compared with the adduct in IMVs (Fig. 5, lane 1 versus lane 4), is possibly related to the His-tag that is present on YidC reconstituted in proteoliposomes. SecYEG was dispensable for these interactions, because cross-linking to YidC was also observed in the absence of SecYEG (Fig. 5, lane 5). Using 100LepTAG100, a similar cross-linking pattern was observed in SecYEG/YidC proteoliposomes as was observed in IMVs showing predominant cross-linking to YidC (Fig. 5, lanes 8, 11, and14). However, in contrast to 50LepTAG10, 100LepTAG10 showed almost no cross-linking to YidC in the absence of SecYEG (Fig. 5,lane 12), suggesting that SecYEG is necessary to bring or keep 100Lep in contact with YidC. 50LepTAG15 showed SecY cross-linking in SecYEG and SecYEG/YidC proteoliposomes, as in IMVs (Fig. 5, lanes 15–17), indicating that 50Lep interacts with SecY independent of the presence of YidC. The difference in mobility of the SecY adducts is most probably caused by the His-tag that is present on SecY in the proteoliposomes (15van der Laan M. Houben E.N.G. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 21: 519-523Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). With SecYEG/YidC proteoliposomes, 50LepTAG15 also cross-linked weakly to YidC in SecYEG/YidC proteoliposomes just as in IMVs (Fig. 5, lanes 15 and18). Again, the cross-linking to YidC in proteoliposomes appeared independent of the presence of SecYEG (Fig. 5 A,lane 19). Taken together, in proteoliposomes, 50Lep appeared to be able to contact SecYEG independent of YidC and vice versa. In contrast, 100Lep did require SecYEG to contact or to remain in contact with YidC. Furthermore, the interactions detected in SecYEG/YidC proteoliposomes are consistent with those in IMVs. In this study we have used Lep as a model IMP to investigate the early stages in membrane insertion. The protein has been used extensively as a model for in vivo inner membrane insertion (12Lee J.-I.

Whereas translocation of the large P2 loop requires SecY, SecE, and SecA (12Lee J.-I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 1836-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), translocation of the small N-terminal tail (fused to a reporter domain) appeared to be Sec-independent in a previous study (12Lee J.-I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 938-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that discrete stages can be distinguished during the membrane integration process of the first TM (H1) in which YidC and SecY play a role (Fig. 6). At the nascent chain length of 40 amino acids, most of H1 is covered by the ribosome, and the nascent chain is not targeted to the translocon or any other membrane components (Fig. 6 A). In nascent chains of 50 amino acids, most of the hydrophobic core of H1 is exposed, and the nascent chain contacts the translocon (Fig.6 B). At this stage, SecY, SecE, and YidC were found close to H1 in a site-specific scanning photocross-linking approach. H1 can be divided into two regions according to the cross-linking patterns. The C-terminal region cross-linked predominantly to SecY and SecE. Even at position 21, which is 29 residues from the peptidyltransferase center, interaction with SecY was detected, suggesting an intimate contact of the translating ribosome with the membrane consistent with the observed affinity of the ribosome for the SecYEG complex (24Prinz A. Behrens C. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intramolecular cross-linking suggested that H1 might bend in this region as a hairpin. In contrast, residues in the N-terminal region of H1 were found to be close to either YidC or SecY suggesting that this region is structured. These results illustrate that a close connection between SecYEG and YidC exists, at least during membrane insertion. The data indicate a very early role for YidC in the recognition of H1 and perhaps in the interaction with the targeted ribosome. Significantly, 50Lep does not require SecYEG to contact YidC in proteoliposomes, and YidC is dispensable for the interaction with SecY. This suggests that partial autonomous contacts are possible at this stage. When short membrane-associated nascent Lep is prematurely released from the ribosome and especially when the ribosome is in addition removed from the membrane, the contact with YidC and SecY is lost. The released nascent chains further integrate into the membrane and are handed over to an ∼56-kDa membrane protein. We have not yet been able to identify this component, but we suspect that it is involved in the quality control of membrane proteins. At the length of 70 amino acids, when H1 is fully exposed, the nascent chains are more efficiently integrated and start contacting lipids while still being close to YidC (Fig. 6 C). This situation remains at least until the nascent chains have reached a length of 100 amino acids (Fig. 6 D). Then, H1 is close to YidC over its entire length. To reach this stage, SecYEG appears to be essential (concluded from the proteoliposome data) and is still associated with the hydrophilic region that follows H1 (6Houben E.N.G. Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Brunner J. de Gier J.-W.L. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Apparently, H1 inserts in a SecYEG/YidC translocon, moves toward a YidC/lipid interface upon elongation, and remains there perhaps until the second TM (H2) is integrated, translation stops, and Lep acquires its final lipid-embedded conformation. This type of model is in agreement with the interactions of the TMs of the polytopic IMP MtlA with YidC at different nascent chain lengths (25Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined at which stage H1 reaches its final orientation in the membrane and whether YidC is required for this process. Recently, a similar study was conducted using FtsQ, which has only one TM with the opposite orientation as compared with Lep H1. With FtsQ a sequential interaction of the TM, first with SecY then with YidC, was observed (7Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Fröderberg L. Sääf A. de Gier J.-W.L. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 6: 524-529Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15van der Laan M. Houben E.N.G. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 21: 519-523Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, it seems that the FtsQ TM contacts lipids earlier during insertion than the H1 of Lep. It should be mentioned that these interactions were probed from only one position in the TM. The current study clearly illustrates that at this stage interactions may be very dependent on the position of the cross-linking agent in the TM. The features of a TM that determine its interactions with and requirements for SecYEG and YidC will be the focus of future research. The early contact of H1 with YidC might explain why translocation of the N terminus of Lep occurs independent of SecY in vivo(12Lee J.-I. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 938-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Possibly, YidC is able to receive H1 and assists in the translocation of the N terminus on its own, whereas SecYEG is more important for the insertion of H2. Notably, YidC appears sufficient for the insertion and translocation of Sec-independent IMPs (8Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7670-7675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, YidC appears to have only a minor effect on the insertion of Lep H1 in vivo (8Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), indicating that Lep can use both YidC and SecYEG for proper insertion and positioning of H1 in the membrane. Interestingly, the insertion of a hybrid Lep construct into the ER has also been investigated (20Heinrich S.U. Mothes W. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As with E. coli membranes, H1 associated co-translationally with the ER and contacted Sec61α (homologous to SecY) when it was of similar length. H1 became lipid-embedded very soon after initial membrane insertion and lost its contact with Sec61α. In this context no extra factor appeared to be required to mediate the lipid partitioning of the H1 that rapidly escaped the translocon. Only when H1 was mutated to decrease its hydrophobicity did it contact the translocating chain-associating membrane (TRAM) that was proposed to keep the mutated H1 close to the Sec61 translocon and facilitate its lipid partitioning. It still seems possible that TRAM and YidC fulfill a similar function, but the timing of their action and their substrate specificity may differ, perhaps related to the different lipid composition of the ER and E. coli membrane."

In in vitro expression assays, the GFP domain of the chimeric protein, S1795GFP, folds rapidly enabling us to monitor the folding of the motor domain using fluorescence. The myosin motor domain folds very slowly and transits through multiple intermediates that are detectable by gel filtration chromatography. The distribution of the nascent protein among these intermediates is strongly dependent upon temperature. At 25 °C and above the predominant product is an aggregate of S1795GFP or a complex with other lysate proteins. At 0 °C, the motor domain folds slowly via an energy independent pathway. The unusual temperature dependence and slow rate suggests that folding of the myosin motor is highly susceptible to off-pathway interactions and aggregation. Expression of the S1795GFP in the C2C12 muscle cell line yields a folded and functionally active protein that exhibits Mg2+ATP-sensitive actin-binding and myosin motor activity. In contrast, expression of S1795GFP in kidney epithelial cell lines (human 293 and COS 7 cells) results in an inactive and aggregated protein. The results of the in vitro folding assay suggest that the myosin motor domain does not fold spontaneously under physiological conditions and probably requires cytosolic chaperones. The expression studies support this conclusion and demonstrate that these factors are optimized in muscle cells.

The results of the in vitro folding assay suggest that the myosin motor domain does not fold spontaneously under physiological conditions and probably requires cytosolic chaperones. The expression studies support this conclusion and demonstrate that these factors are optimized in muscle cells. heavy meromyosin chaperonin containing TCP-1 green fluorescent protein heat shock protein monoclonal antibody motor domain::GFP chimeric protein myosin subfragment 1 myosin subfragment 2 dithiothreitol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Muscle myosin, the prototype of the myosin II family, is a large asymmetric, multidomain protein composed of six polypeptides: two heavy chains of molecular weight 220,000 and two pairs of nonidentical light chains of molecular weights 17,000–23,000. The myosin catalytic or motor domain is a compact structure formed by the amino-terminal ∼780 residues of the heavy chain (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). The core folding motif is a 7-strand, mostly parallel, β-sheet that is flanked by three α-helices on each side and forms the ATP-binding pocket. This structural motif is shared with the kinesin family of microtubule-based motors and with G-proteins involved in signal transduction (2Rayment I. Structure. 1996; 4: 501-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 3Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Myosin contains large insertions in the connecting loops of the core motif. These insertions form an extended actin-binding surface and distinguish the myosin structure from kinesin and the G-proteins. The core motif that is the heart of the myosin motor domain is discontinuous and includes segments of primary structure from the entire length of the 780-residue catalytic domain. Thus, it is not surprising that the myosin motor domain has not been refolded once denatured in vitro (4Levitsky D.I. Khvorov N.V. Shnyrov V.L. Vedenkina N.S. Permyakov E.A. Poglazov B.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or successfully expressed in bacterial expression systems as, for example, the much more compact and structurally related kinesin motor domain (5Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The myosin light chain-binding domain corresponds to an 85-Å long α-helix that emerges from the myosin motor domain and is stabilized by the binding of two nonidentical light chains. This domain is believed to act as a lever arm to amplify and transmit structural changes in the catalytic domain into relative motion of actin and myosin (6Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The light chain binding helix terminates in a proline that starts the long α-helical coiled-coil rod domain. In our previous analysis (7Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27265-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) of the myosin folding pathway using heavy meromyosin (HMM),1 we demonstrated that light chain binding and folding of the S2 domain of the rod precede motor domain folding. We inferred in that study that folding of the myosin motor domain was rate-limiting and was mediated by cycles of chaperonin binding and release. To confirm this hypothesis, we were interested in investigating the folding of the motor domain in the absence of the influence of the myosin light chains or dimerization of the heavy chain. Here we present an analysis of the folding of a skeletal muscle myosin motor domain::GFP chimeric protein. The chimeric protein was designed to eliminate the light chain-binding region and replace it with a fast folding variant of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (8Siemering K.R. Golbik R. Sever R. Haseloff J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1653-1663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). When synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, we observe slow folding kinetics for the motor domain of the newly synthesized chimeric protein and thermal instability that suggests a dependence on folding factors, e.g. molecular chaperones, for motor domain folding. Using a replication defective adenovirus expression vector, the motor domain::GFP chimera was expressed in kidney epithelial cell lines and skeletal muscle myocytes. Only muscle cells produce a properly folded and functional myosin. Based on these observations, we conclude that the folding of skeletal muscle myosin and specifically the motor domain requires folding factors that are uniquely present in muscle cells. The skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain is encoded by the epitope-tagged embryonic chicken myosin cDNA previously described (7Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27265-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Kinose F. Wang S.X. Kidambi U.S. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The 3′ end of the myosin motor domain was amplified by PCR and a PstI site was introduced with the 5′ primer, CCTGGACATCGCTGGCTTTG, and the 3′ primer, TGCCTGCAGCCTGTGTGCGAGTGATGAGC, from the p4HMMa plasmid (7Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27265-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The 1-kb PCR product was digested withBglII and PstI and inserted between theBglII and PstI cloning sites of p4HMMa, effectively truncating the motor domain coding region at amino acid residue 795. The GFP coding sequence was truncated at the 5′ end and aPstI site was introduced by PCR with the 5′ primer, GTACTGCAGAAGAACTTTTCACTGGAG, and the 3′ primer, ATTTAGGTGACACTATA. The 825-bp GFP insert was digested with PstI cloned into the newly created PstI site of the truncated myosin expression vector. The 5′ end of the S1795GFP coding sequence is adjacent to the plasmid Sp6 promoter in the final vector facilitating expression in vitro in a coupled transcription-translation assay. The complete coding region of the vector, p4-S1795GFP, was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid p4-S1795GFP was transcribed with Sp6 RNA polymerase and translated in a reticulocyte lysate using the TnT coupled transcription-translation system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The reactions were performed as per the manufacturers recommendations in the presence of 80 μCi/100-μl reaction of [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 2 h. Translation reactions (200 μl) containing newly synthesized S1795GFP were depleted of Mg2+ATP and exchanged into column buffer by rapid gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 spin column (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm MES, pH 6.9, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT (7Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27265-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The effluent from the Sephadex column was divided into aliquots and either stored on ice or incubated with 5 mm Mg+2ATP for an additional 60 min at 30 °C. The aliquots were analyzed on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in the same buffer at 25 °C. The elution characteristics of the 10-mm inner diameter × 30-cm long Superose 6 column (flow rate of 0.25 ml/min) were calibrated using myosin, HMM, myosin S1, and myosin light chains, hemoglobin, serum albumin, and reticulocyte CCT (purified as described in Ref. 10Norcum M.T. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1366-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and recorded with both a UV monitor and an in-line Gilson model 121 fluorometer with GFP filter set (Gilson, Madison, WI). Column fractions (0.5 ml) were analyzed by scintillation counting and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27265-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The radioactive S1795GFP in the column fractions was quantitated by autoradiography of the dried SDS gels and densitometry (AmershamBiosciences). Human 293 cells (CRL 1573; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) are a kidney cell line transformed with the early region of human adenovirus 5. These cells contain the genes necessary to package pAdEasy DNA and amplify the replication defective adenovirus (11He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). The 293 cells were maintained in growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% gentamycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. COS 7 cells (CRL 1651; American Type Culture Collection), an African green monkey kidney cell line derived from SV40-transformed CV1 cells, were grown and maintained similar to the 293 cells. Growth and fusion of the mouse myogenic cell line, C2C12 (CRL 1772; American Type Culture Collection), has been described previously in detail (7Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27265-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Kinose F. Wang S.X. Kidambi U.S. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The shuttle vector, pSH-S1795GFP, was prepared from the p4-S1795GFP vector already described. The S1795GFP coding sequence is flanked by EcoRI restriction sites, so this fragment was excised and cloned into the EcoRI site of the AdEasy shuttle vector, pShuttleCMV (11He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). Clones were selected for the correct orientation of the S1795GFP insert with respect to the cytomegalovirus promoter and the polyadenylation signal sequence. Recombinant adenovirus DNA was prepared by homologous recombination of pSH-S1795GFP with the pAdEasy1 vector inEscherichia coli strain BJ5183 essentially as described (11He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). Colonies were selected for kanamycin resistance and plasmid DNA was characterized by restriction digestion. The recombinant vector DNA was subcloned into E. coli DH10B cells and the pAdS1795GFP DNA was purified by CsCl density gradient. Human 293 cells were plated in T-25 flasks for transfection with linearized pAdS1795GFP DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). About 12 μg of purified pAdS1795GFP DNA was linearized by digestion withPacI. The linear DNA was then diluted to 1 ml with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). In parallel, 50 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent was diluted in 1 ml of Opti-MEM and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The DNA and the LipofectAMINE dilutions were combined and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The 293 cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with 5 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM at 37 °C. One ml of the DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture was added per T-25 flask and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the CO2incubator. After 2 h, 0.6 ml of fetal bovine serum and 60 μl of sodium pyruvate (100 mm) were added to each flask. Cells were maintained at 37 °C for 7–10 days during which they were monitored by fluorescence microscopy for S1795GFP protein expression and virus plaque formation. The adenovirus was harvested once virus plaques were evident and about 50% of the cells were rounded and detaching from the surface. The infected 293 cells were collected and pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and finally suspended in 0.5 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed at 37 °C, and vortexed vigorously. This procedure was repeated for 4 cycles. The cell debris was spun down, and the supernatant containing the virus stock was collected and stored in −80 °C, or amplified by additional rounds of infection of 293 cells. Virus titer was determined by infection of confluent 293 cells with serial dilutions of virus stock and scoring for GFP positive cells 24–36 h post-infection. The virus was expanded by infection of a large number of plates of confluent 293 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 3–5. When most of the infected 293 cells round-up and begin to detach, the virus was harvested from the cells by cycles of freeze-thaw. Virus titers of 1010–1011 plaque forming units/ml are routinely achieved by this method. COS 7 cells at 70–80% confluence were infected with the AdS1795GFP virus at a multiplicity of infection of ∼100. The infected cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and monitored for green fluorescence and growth until the protein was harvested 48–96 h post-infection. C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes were infected at about 10-fold higher multiplicity of infection (∼1000) because these cells appear less sensitive to this human virus. Myoblasts were infected while subconfluent and maintained in growth medium for ∼72 h prior to harvest. Myotubes were infected 2–4 days postfusion once they were well differentiated. Infected myotubes were maintained for 4–5 days in fusion medium prior to harvest of the recombinant protein. The recombinant protein was isolated from 10–20 100-mm dishes of infected COS 7 cells, C2C12 myoblasts, or myotubes. The cell layer was rinsed twice with 5–10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in sucrose/Triton extraction buffer (STEB: 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mmimidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmMg2+ATP, 1 mm DTT). The combined, scraped cell layer was transferred to a Dounce homogenizer and disrupted with 10–15 strokes on ice. The extract was separated from cell debris by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The majority of the fluorescence (>90%) is in this Triton-soluble fraction. The STEB extract was fractionated with ammonium sulfate using steps of 0–20, 20–40, and 40–60% saturation. The samples were incubated 30 min at 0 °C between steps and the precipitate was pelleted for 20 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The redissolved pellets were dialyzed against a low salt buffer: either 20 mm MES, pH 6.9, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT for gel filtration or 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT for anion exchange chromatography. Samples were fractionated by anion exchange chromatography on a HR 5/5 Mono-Q column at 23 °C (Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mmimidazole buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl over 22 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The distribution of the S1795GFP in each fraction was quantitated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Column fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Blots were probed with the anti-myosin mAb, 4H7.6, and an anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and developed with a chemiluminiscence detection kit (Pierce). The anion exchange column fractions containing the S1795GFP extracted from muscle cells were pooled and F-actin was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The sample was dialyzed against 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT for 4 h to remove the Mg2+ATP and then sedimented at 300,000 × g for 20 min. The F-actin pellet was resuspended in the same buffer with 1 mmMg2+ATP added and sedimented again at 300,000 ×g for 20 min to release the bound S1795GFP. The samples were dialyzed against 25 mm imidazole, 25 mm KCl, 4.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT. F-actin was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C with or without added 1 mm Mg2+ATP before centrifugation in an Airfuge at 300,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were recovered and diluted for quantitative fluorimetry. Skeletal muscle actin was prepared from an acetone powder of chicken pectoralis muscle (12Winkelmann D.A. Bourdieu L. Ott A. Kinose F. Libchaber A. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The in vitro motility assay was done essentially as described previously (9Kinose F. Wang S.X. Kidambi U.S. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Winkelmann D.A. Bourdieu L. Ott A. Kinose F. Libchaber A. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An anti-GFP monoclonal antibody, 3E6 (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and an anti-S2 mAb, 10F12.3, were bound to nitrocellulose-coated glass coverslips prior to incubation with the purified S1795GFP for 2–4 h in a humidified chamber at 4 °C. The coverslips were washed and then transferred to a 15-μl drop of motility buffer (25 mm imidazole, 25 mmKCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 7.5 mm Mg2+ATP, 0.5% methylcellulose, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.018 mg/ml catalase, 2.3 mg/ml glucose, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6) containing 1 nm phalloidin-rhodamine labeled F-actin and affixed to a small parafilm ring on an alumina slide with vacuum grease. This chamber was observed with a ×100 Plan Apochromat (1.3 NA) objective on a Olympus BH-2 microscope equipped with a rhodamine epifluorescence filter set and illuminated with a 100 watt mercury light source. Images were projected with a ×3.3 TV tube onto the photocathode of an image intensifier optically coupled to a CCD video camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ) and recorded with a SVHS video recorder. The temperature of the alumina slide was maintained at 30 °C with a Peltier temperature controlled stage (Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, NJ) and an objective heater (Bioptechs, Inc., Butler, PA). Movement of actin filaments was analyzed with semiautomated filament tracking programs (9Kinose F. Wang S.X. Kidambi U.S. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Bourdieu L. Magnasco M.O. Winkelmann D.A. Libchaber A. Phys. Rev. 1995; 52: 6573-6579Google Scholar). To analyze the folding of the motor domain of a skeletal muscle myosin, we designed a chimeric protein composed of the first 795 residues of an embryonic chicken-striated muscle myosin II gene fused to GFP. The myosin motor domain::GFP chimeric protein is designated S1795GFP. The truncated myosin motor domain lacks the long α-helix that forms the essential and regulatory myosin light chain-binding sites. This light chain-binding domain acts as a semi-rigid lever arm (14Uyeda T.Q. Abramson P.D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It is replaced by a fast folding variant of GFP that contains the S65T mutation to enhance fluorescence sensitivity and two additional COOH-terminal mutations found to improve thermal stability and accelerate folding (8Siemering K.R. Golbik R. Sever R. Haseloff J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1653-1663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The design of the fusion junction was done with the aid of the molecular models of both myosin S1 and GFP using the interactive molecular graphics package molmol (15Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51–55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). The goal was to minimize the introduction of the extraneous intervening sequence between the two protein domains of the chimera. The myosin α-helix that projects from the converter domain and forms the light chain-binding domain was truncated within the IQ motif that forms the essential light chain-binding site (Fig.1). The myosin α-helix was joined to a short α-helix on the amino terminus of the GFP structure (16Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). To optimize the position of the GFP with respect to the motor domain, the first 4 residues of GFP were deleted to make the fusion. These residues form the first turn of an NH2-terminal GFP α-helix and were replaced by the last turn of a myosin α-helix. Once the design was completed and the expression vector constructed, a molecular model was prepared by merging the two sets of atomic coordinates. The resulting model of the 116-kDa protein is shown in Fig. 1 together with details of the junction between the two domains. A complete cDNA for this chimeric protein was prepared using PCR and standard cloning techniques and a series of expression vectors were constructed and sequenced. The S1795GFP cDNA was cloned into a plasmid adjacent to a bacterial Sp6 promoter to express S1795GFP in an in vitro transcription and translation assay that we have used to study myosin folding (7Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27265-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The assay uses purified SP6 RNA polymerase for transcription in a coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system. The expression of the single chain S1795GFP was quite efficient as measured by incorporation of [35S]methionine into the nascent protein (data not shown). We were interested in determining if folding intermediates could be detected, as were found for co-expression of nascent heavy meromyosin with myosin light chains (7Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27265-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of S1795GFP was stopped and unincorporated [35S]methionine and Mg2+ATP were depleted from the translation assay mixture by rapid buffer exchange on a Sephadex G-50 spin column. Aliquots of the assay mixture were then analyzed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig.2). The newly synthesized S1795GFP was detected using an in-line fluorescent detector set to the GFP fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths and by measuring the incorporation of [35S]methionine. The column fractions were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the elution profile of the radioactive 116-kDa S1795GFP was quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiograph. The fluorescent protein was found in a broad peak eluting from the Superose 6 column between 10 and 15 ml (Fig. 2, A and B). The fluorescence signal derived from the GFP domain of the chimeric protein correlates with the elution profile of the radioactive 116-kDa protein detected by SDS-PAGE, confirming that both signals mark the elution of the newly synthesized S1795GFP protein. The GFP domain of the chimeric protein must fold and autoxidize rapidly in the in vitro reaction to produce the fluorescence signal detected in the column effluent. However, the broad distribution of fluorescence and radioactivity in the column effluent suggests that the chimeric protein is a heterogeneous mixture of conformers and is not monodisperse. The molecular weight of S1795GFP (116,000) and the predicted shape of the chimera (Fig. 1) are very similar to that of the myosin proteolytic subfragment, S1 (135 kDa). So, one would expect the hydrodynamics of the two proteins to be essentially indistinguishable on a Superose 6 column. Myosin S1 elutes from the Superose 6 column as a sharp peak centered at 15 ml and its elution position is marked on the profiles in Fig. 2. Most of the newly synthesized S1795GFP protein elutes from the column with a higher apparent molecular weight (Fig. 2 A). This behavior is consistent with a less compact structure, an aggregate, or a heterodisperse complex of S1795GFP with other lysate proteins. A small shoulder of the main S1795GFP peak elutes from the column at the position of myosin S1, suggesting that perhaps a fraction of the chimera has achieved the compact structure expected of a native myosin motor domain. The sample in Fig. 2 A was depleted of Mg2+ATP and kept on ice for 40 min before fractionation on the gel filtration column. Previous work has implicated the cytoplasmic molecular chaperonin, CCT, as having a important role in the myosin folding pathway (7Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27265-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To stimulate chaperonin activity and facilitate the folding of the motor domain, an aliquot of the S1795GFP was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with added Mg2+ATP (Fig.2 B). Instead of improving the recovery of properly folded S1795GFP, incubation at the elevated temperature shifted the distribution of fluorescence and radioactive protein toward higher molecular weight complexes and aggregates. A fraction of the protein appears to be eluting in the position of CCT. This treatment does not appear to have improved the folding of S1795GFP. Incubation at 30 °C may be expected to enhance hydrophobic interactions and favor both the interaction with molecular chaperones and off-pathway aggregation. The sample that was kept on ice without Mg2+ATP (Fig.2 A) appears less heterogeneous than the sample incubated in folding conditions (Fig. 2 B), so we examined the effect of cold incubation on the folding of S1795GFP. Newly synthesized protein was depleted of Mg2+ATP with a spin column and incubated at 0 °C for various periods prior to analysis by gel filtration (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, prolonged incubation at low temperatures improved the folding as shown by the increase in the fluorescent peak eluting at the position of native S1. Several intermediates are evident in the samples from shorter incubations at 0 °C. These intermediates disappear with time as the quantity of S1795GFP eluting at the position of native S1 increases. The addition of Mg2+ATP during the incubation at 0 °C appears to have little effect on the “cold folding” of S1795GFP. This would suggest that this cold folding pathway is not an energy-dependent chaperone-mediated pathway. From these data we conclude that the GFP domain of the S1795GFP chimera folds rapidly producing a readily detected fluorescence signal that corresponds to the newly synthesized protein. The myosin motor domain of the chimera does not fold rapidly and under normal conditions of synthesis (30 °C with Mg2+ATP) the chimera either aggregates, or associates with lysate components,e.g. molecular chaperones. Incubation of S1795GFP at 0 °C, a temperature that does not favor the hydrophobic interactions necessary for chaperone binding (17Smith D.F. Schowalter D.B. Kost S.L. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), promotes a slow, chaperone-independent folding pathway. The rate of folding under these conditions is very slow, clearly too slow to be of physiological significance. This observation suggest"
https://openalex.org/W2110878701,"Deposition of fibrillar amyloid-β protein (Aβ) in senile plaques and in the walls of cerebral blood vessels is a key pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease and certain related disorders. Fibrillar Aβ deposition is intimately associated with neuronal and cerebrovascular cell death both in vivo and in vitro. Similarly, accumulation of the Aβ protein precursor (AβPP) is also observed at sites of fibrillar Aβ deposition. Recently, we reported that fibrillar Aβ, but not unassembled Aβ, promotes the specific binding of AβPP through its cysteine-rich, amino-terminal region (Melchor, J. P., and Van Nostrand, W. E.

A series of synthesized overlapping peptides spanning the cysteine-rich, amino-terminal region of AβPP were used as competitors for AβPP binding to fibrillar Aβ. A peptide spanning residues 105–119 of AβPP competitively inhibited AβPP binding to fibrillar Aβ in a solid-phase binding assay and on the surface of cultured human cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of residues 105–117 within glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-AβPP-(18–119) revealed that His110, Val112, and Ile113 are key residues that facilitate AβPP binding to fibrillar Aβ. These specific residues belong to a common β-strand within this region of AβPP. Wild-type GST-AβPP-(18–119) protected cultured human cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells from Aβ-induced toxicity whereas H110A mutant GST-AβPP-(18–119) did not. Wild-type GST-AβPP-(18–119) bound to different isoforms of fibrillar Aβ and fibrillar amylin peptides whereas H110A mutant and I113A mutant GST-AβPP-(18–119) were substantially less efficient binding to each fibrillar peptide. We conclude that His110, Val112, and Ile113, residing in a common β-strand region within AβPP-(18–119), comprise a domain that mediates the binding of AβPP to fibrillar peptides. Deposition of fibrillar amyloid-β protein (Aβ) in senile plaques and in the walls of cerebral blood vessels is a key pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease and certain related disorders. Fibrillar Aβ deposition is intimately associated with neuronal and cerebrovascular cell death both in vivo and in vitro. Similarly, accumulation of the Aβ protein precursor (AβPP) is also observed at sites of fibrillar Aβ deposition. Recently, we reported that fibrillar Aβ, but not unassembled Aβ, promotes the specific binding of AβPP through its cysteine-rich, amino-terminal region (Melchor, J. P., and Van Nostrand, W. E.

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Aβ is a 39–43-amino acid peptide that has the propensity to self-assemble into insoluble, β-sheet-containing fibrils (1Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev.

Aβ is proteolytically derived from a large type I integral membrane precursor protein, termed the amyloid β-protein precursor (AβPP), encoded by a gene located on chromosome 21 (3–6). In this regard, full-length AβPP is proteolytically cleaved by an enzyme, termed β-secretase, at the amino terminus of the Aβ domain. A novel aspartyl proteinase named BACE (for β-site AβPP-CleavingEnzyme) has been identified as the β-secretase enzyme (7Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Khan S. Mendiaz E. Denis P. Teplow D.B.

Subsequent cleavage of the remaining amyloidogenic membrane spanning AβPP carboxyl-terminal fragment by an enzyme termed γ-secretase liberates the 40- or 42-amino acid residue Aβ peptide. Although the exact identity of γ-secretase remains unclear studies suggest that the presenilin proteins may function as this enzyme or as a required cofactor for γ-secretase function (11De Strooper B.

Alternatively, full-length AβPP can be proteolytically processed by an enzyme termed α-secretase through the Aβ domain. This cleavage event generates a non-amyloidogenic membrane spanning carboxyl-terminal fragment and truncated secretory forms of AβPPα (sAβPPα) that are released into the extracellular environment (14Esch F.S.

Cerebrovascular Aβ deposition, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, is accompanied by smooth muscle cell degeneration suggesting a toxic effect of Aβ to these cells in vivo (16Coria F.

These degenerating smooth muscle cells have been implicated in the overproduction of AβPP and Aβ in the cerebral vessel wall further suggesting the active involvement of these cells in the progression of this cerebrovascular pathology (17Kawai M.

Similar to these in vivo observations, we have reported that Aβ-(1–42), the more pathogenic form of the wild-type peptide, causes severe cellular degeneration accompanied by a marked increase in the level of cell-associated AβPP in cultured human cerebrovascular smooth muscle (HCSM) cells (20Davis-Salinas J.

In more recent studies we demonstrated that mutations associated with familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (E22Q Dutch, E22K Italian, and D23N Iowa) markedly enhance both the fibrillogenic and cerebrovascular pathogenic properties of Aβ toward cultured HCSM cells (23Davis J. Van Nostrand W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2996-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J. Ruffini L. J.

These experiments showed that these pathogenic forms of Aβ assemble into an elaborate network of fibrils on the surfaces of HCSM cells. Furthermore, fibril assembly of pathogenic Aβ on the cell surface is required for inducing downstream pathologic responses in HCSM cells, including cell-surface accumulation of sAβPPα, degradation of vascular smooth muscle cell α-actin, and ultimately an apoptotic cell death (24Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J. Ruffini L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 216-223Google Scholar, 25Melchor J.P. McVoy L. Van Nostrand W.E. J.

Amyloid. 1999; 6: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have shown that the accumulation of sAβPPα is mediated by its high-affinity binding to the Aβ fibrils that assemble on the HCSM cell surface (28Melchor J.P. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9782-9791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This event coincides with the induction of smooth muscle cell α-actin degradation and cell death. It is noteworthy that an interaction between fibrillar Aβ and AβPP also has been implicated in neuronal cell death in vitro (29Lorenzo A. Yuan M. Zhang Z. Paganetti P.A. Sturchler-Pierrat C. Staufenbiel M. Mautino J. Sol Vigo F. Sommer B. Yankner B.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Finally, Aβ fibril binding to Kunitz proteinase inhibitory (KPI) domain containing forms of AβPP can enhance its proteinase inhibitory property (30Wagner M.R. Keane D.M. Melchor J.P. Auspaker K. Van Nostrand W.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Together, these findings indicate that interactions between fibrillar Aβ binding and AβPP may have significant physiological and pathological consequences. In the present study, we identify the precise site in the cysteine-rich, amino-terminal region of AβPP that facilitates its binding to fibrillar forms of Aβ. Our investigations show that residues His110, Val112, and Ile113, all on a common β-strand region within AβPP, comprise a domain on AβPP that is involved with its binding to fibrillar Aβ peptides. This domain also mediates the binding of AβPP to other fibrillar peptides, suggesting that this region may participate in other biologically important interactions. Aβ peptides were synthesized by solid-phase Fmoc ((N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)) amino acid chemistry, purified by reverse phase-HPLC, and structurally characterized as previously described (31Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Cotman C.W. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amylin peptide was obtained from Bachem (San Carlos, CA). For preparation of amyloid fibrils, Aβ peptides or amylin were resuspended to a final concentration of 1.25 mm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. The β-sheet, fibrillar structure of each peptide was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and electron microscopy as previously described (24Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J. Ruffini L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 216-223Google Scholar). For cell culture experiments, lyophilized Aβ peptide was first resuspended to a concentration of 250 μm in sterile distilled water. Prior to addition to HCSM cells, the peptide was diluted to a final concentration of 25 μm in serum-free culture medium. The set of overlapping 15 amino acid peptides spanning AβPP residues 18–119 was prepared by Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA). Wild-type sAβPPα-770 was purified as previously described (32Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Farrow J.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9591-9594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was biotinylated according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Pierce EZ Sulfo-link Biotin (Rockford, IL). The anti-AβPP mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) P2–1, which specifically recognizes an epitope in the amino-terminal region of human AβPP, was prepared as previously described (33Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Suzuki M. Choi B.H. Farrow J.S. Geddes J.W. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. Nature. 1989; 341: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The anti-AβPP mAb 22C11 was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Secondary peroxidase–coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from AmershamBiosciences. Supersignal Dura West chemiluminescence substrate was purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Aβ peptides or amylin were assembled into fibrils as described above. For most studies we used fibrillar forms of Dutch-type Aβ40 since this mutant form of Aβ exhibits enhanced fibrillogenic and pathogenic properties compared with wild-type Aβ. Two μg of each fibrillar Aβ peptide, fibrillar amylin, or ovalbumin in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were dried in a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning, Cambridge, MA) overnight at 37 °C. The wells were rinsed with PBS three times and blocked with 100 μl per well PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing three times with PBS, known concentrations of biotinylated sAβPPα in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA were incubated in triplicate (100 μl per well) for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing the wells with PBS three times, 100 μl of streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA (1:800) was added for 1 h at room temperature. The binding of biotinylated sAβPPα was detected using the colorimetric substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrocholride as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Briefly, the substrate was diluted in buffer (0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.5) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 0.012% immediately before 100 μl of the substrate was added to each microtiter well. The solution was developed for ∼30 min at room temperature and quenched by the addition of 50 μl of 4 N H2SO4 to each well. The conversion of the colorimetric substrate was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm using a Molecular Dynamics V max kinetic plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA). Alternatively, known concentrations of GST-AβPP-(18–119) proteins were added to the wells followed by the anti-AβPP mAb 22C11 at a dilution of 1 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA and a secondary anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000). Bound secondary antibody was detected using the colorimetric substrate as described above. The pGEX-KG-human AβPP exon 2–3 fusion construct, encoding AβPP residues 18–119, was prepared as previously described (28Melchor J.P. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9782-9791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Individual amino acids from Cys105 through Cys117 within exon 3 were mutagenized to Ala employing single nucleotide change approach using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, complementary oligonucleotides used in the site-directed mutagenesis were 5′ phosphorylated, ∼40 bases in length with 20 matched bases on either side of the point mutation, possessing aTm ≥ 78 °C and containing at least 40% GC content. The 50-μl PCR reaction sample included 40 ng of the pGEX-KG-human AβPP exon 2–3 fusion construct and 125 ng of the sense and antisense oligonucleotides. The PCR program was as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 30 s, 20 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 20 min, and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was then digested with DpnI for 1.5 h to remove methylated parental DNA as per the manufacturer's protocol. The digested sample was transformed into Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells and grown on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Colonies were chosen and plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced to confirm the presence of each mutation. In some cases, a second mutation was needed to change the codon to alanine. In these cases, sequential mutagenesis was done using two mutagenesis oligonucleotide sets, the second set with both mutations. The plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the second mutation. Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transformed with wild-type and mutant pGEX-KG-human AβPP exon 2–3 fusion constructs, plated on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 °C, and colonies were picked and used to inoculate 100 ml LB media. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thioglucoside to a final concentration of 1 mm for 4 h. Wild-type and mutant GST-AβPP-(18–119) fusion proteins were affinity-purified from the harvested cells using glutathione–Sepharose beads as previously described (28Melchor J.P. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9782-9791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The concentration of the eluted GST-AβPP-(18–119) fusion proteins was measured using the extinction coefficient of GST. The precise concentrations of wild-type and each mutant GST-AβPP-(18–119) protein were confirmed by titration using mAb 22C11 and compared with standard curves of known concentrations of purified sAβPPα. The mAb 22C11 was used for the precise titrations since its epitope on AβPP and GST-AβPP-(18–119) resides upstream of residues 105–117 and was not affected by any of the alanine substitutions inserted in the mutant fusion proteins. Primary cultures of HCSM cells were established and characterized as previously described (34Van Nostrand W.E. Rozemuller A.J. M Chung R. Cotman C.W. Saporito-Irwin S.M. Amyloid. 1994; 1: 1-7Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two lines of HCSM cells were used in these studies. One was derived from a 70-year-old male AD patient and the other was derived from a 37-year-old female control. All HCSM cells were used between passages 4–7 and maintained in 24-well tissue culture dishes with Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Calabasas, CA), non-essential amino acids, and antibiotics (Invitrogen). For experiments, near-confluent cultures of HCSM cells were placed in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA, non-essential amino acids, and antibiotics overnight prior to treatment. Freshly solubilized Dutch-type Aβ-(1–40) at a final concentration of 25 μm was added to the cultures in serum-free medium and incubated at 37 °C for 6 days. Cells were routinely viewed and photographed using an Olympus IX70 phase-contrast microscope. Cell viability was quantified using a fluorescent live/dead cell assay following the manufacturer's protocol(molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The number of live and dead cells were counted from several fields (n = 4) from at least three separate wells for each experiment. We showed that the amino-terminal region AβPP-(18–119), encoded by exons 2 and 3 of the AβPP gene, mediates the binding of AβPP to fibrillar forms of Aβ (28Melchor J.P. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9782-9791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here we sought to identify the precise site within this region of AβPP that is responsible for this interaction. To accomplish this, we synthesized a series of overlapping peptides of 15 amino acids starting at residue 18 of AβPP with each subsequent peptide shifting 3 amino acids toward the carboxyl-terminal end. This approach covered the entire region of AβPP-(18–119) (Fig. 1). Each of these peptides was tested for its ability to compete against biotinylated sAβPPα for binding to fibrillar Aβ in a solid-phase binding assay. At a relatively high concentration of 1 mm, the peptide AβPP-(105–119) competed for ∼80% of the biotinylated sAβPPα binding to fibrillar Aβ (Fig.2 A, lane 3). In contrast, a 1000-fold lower concentration of GST-AβPP- (18–119) completely blocked biotinylated sAβPPα binding to immobilized fibrillar Aβ (Fig. 2 A,lane 2). We also found that overlapping peptide AβPP-(102–116) possessed some competing activity in the assay, although it was approximately half that of AβPP-(105–119) (data not shown). However, none of the other 15-mer peptides showed either appreciable or consistent competing activity.Figure 2AβPP-(105–119) blocks sAβPP binding to fibrillar Aβ. A, two μg of fibrillar Dutch-type Aβ-(1–40) in 100 μl of PBS were dried overnight in triplicate wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. After washing, the wells were incubated with 50 nmbiotinylated sAβPPα in the absence or presence of 1 μm GST-AβPP-(18–119) or 1 mmAβPP-(105–119) followed by a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The binding of biotinylated sAβPPα was detected using the colorimetric substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and measured at a wavelength of 490 nm using a Molecular Devices V max microplate reader.Lane 1, biotinylated sAβPP alone; lane 2, biotinylated sAβPP + GST-AβPP-(18–119); and lane 3, biotinylated sAβPP + AβPP-(105–119).

InC, the data represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We previously showed that fibrillar Aβ assembled on the surface of HCSM cells mediates the binding of endogenously produced sAβPPα on the cell surface (24Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J. Ruffini L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 216-223Google Scholar, 28Melchor J.P. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9782-9791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results obtained from the solid-phase binding assay, GST-AβPP-(18–119) completely inhibited endogenous sAβPPα binding to HCSM cell surface fibrillar Aβ, whereas higher concentrations of AβPP-(105–119) could partially diminish this AβPP binding (Fig. 2, B andC). The findings that AβPP-(105–119) peptide was less effective than GST-AβPP-(18–119) and that higher concentrations of AβPP-(105–119) peptide were needed in blocking sAβPPα binding to fibrillar Aβ likely results from this region in AβPP being highly structured containing three intrachain disulfide bonds (Fig. 1). The peptide-mapping experiments described above indicated that the sequence AβPP-(105–119) contains the fibrillar Aβ binding domain. However, this small peptide was not nearly effective as the larger, recombinantly expressed AβPP-(18–119) in binding to fibrillar Aβ. Therefore, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies of the AβPP-(105–119) sequence within AβPP-(18–119) to further identify key epitopes important in facilitating its binding to fibrillar Aβ. Alanine residues were introduced from Cys105 through Cys117 of AβPP-(18–119) by site-directed mutagenesis of the AβPP-(18–119) cDNA. Each mutant AβPP-(18–119) cDNA was expressed as a GST fusion protein amd purified, and the concentrations were carefully determined by quantitative immunoblotting as described in “Experimental Procedures”. Each purified mutant GST-AβPP-(19–118) was tested for its ability to bind immobilized fibrillar Aβ in a solid-phase binding assay and compared with the level of binding observed with wild-type GST-AβPP-(18–119). As shown in Fig. 3 most of the alanine substitutions had modest inhibitory or enhancing effects on GST-AβPP-(18–119) binding to fibrillar Aβ. However, alanine substitutions at residues His110, Val112, or Ile113 showed highly diminished GST-AβPP-(18–119) binding to fibrillar Aβ. In particular, H110A mutant GST-AβPP-(18–119) exhibited <10% of fibrillar Aβ binding compared with wild-type GST-AβPP-(18–119). The x-ray crystal structure for this amino-terminal region of AβPP was recently reported (35Rossjohn J. Cappai R. Feil S.C. Henry A. McKinstry W.J. Galatis D. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Parker M.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Based on a predicted structural fold of this region, it is interesting to note that residues His110, Val112, and Ile113 all reside on the same β-strand of AβPP-(18–119) (Fig. 4). Also observed in these studies was that the C117A mutant GST-AβPP-(18–119) showed markedly diminished binding to fibrillar Aβ compared with wild-type GST-AβPP-(18–119). Residue Cys117 participates in a disulfide bond with Cys73 (Figs. 1 and 4), suggesting that this linkage is important in presenting a properly folded fibrillar Aβ binding domain in AβPP-(18–119) likely involving a β-strand within this region that includes specific residues His110, Val112, and Ile113.Figure 4Molecular model of the putative fibrillar Aβ binding site on AβPP-(18–119). A, using the x-ray crystal structure coordinates reported by Rossjohn et al. (35Rossjohn J. Cappai R. Feil S.C. Henry A. McKinstry W.J. Galatis D. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L.

https://openalex.org/W2169974126,"Abstract Moraxella catarrhalis IgD-binding protein (MID), a 200-kDa outer membrane protein comprising 2,139 amino acids, has recently been isolated and shown to display a unique and specific affinity for human IgD. To identify the IgD-binding region, MID was digested with proteases. In addition, a series of truncated fragments of MID were manufactured and expressed in Escherichia coli followed by analysis for IgD binding in Western and dot blots. The smallest fragment with essentially preserved IgD binding was comprised of 238 amino acid residues (MID962–1200). Shorter recombinant proteins gradually lost IgD-binding capacity, and the shortest IgD-binding fragment comprising 157 amino acids (MID985–1142) displayed a 1,000-fold reduced IgD binding compared with the full-length molecule. The truncated MID962–1200 was efficiently attracted to a standard IgD serum and to purified myeloma IgD(κ) and IgD(λ) sera but not to IgG, IgM, or IgA myeloma sera. Furthermore, the fragment specifically bound to peripheral blood B lymphocytes, and the binding was inhibited by preincubation with anti-IgD-Fab polyclonal antibodies. Results obtained by introducing five amino acids randomly into MID962–1200 using transposons suggested that α-helix structures were important for IgD binding. Ultracentrifugation experiments and gel electrophoresis revealed that native MID962–1200 was a tetramer. Interestingly, tetrameric MID962–1200 attracted IgD more than 20-fold more efficiently than the monomeric form. Thus, a tetrameric structure of MID962–1200 is crucial for optimal IgD-binding capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1988362962,"Growth hormone (GH) and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3) are regulators of bone growth and bone metabolism. In target cells, GH activates several signaling pathways, among them the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway. GH mainly activates JAK2 and STAT5a and b. The effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3are mediated via a nuclear receptor, the vitamin D receptor, which, when bound by 1,25-(OH)2D3, activates the transcription of target genes. In earlier studies (Morel, G., Chavassieux, P., Barenton, B., Dubois, P. M., Meunier, P. J., and Boivin, G. (1993) Cell Tissue Res.273, 279–286) synergistic interaction between 1,25-(OH)2D3and GH regarding expression of osteoblastic markers has been described. The UMR 106 cell line is a rat osteosarcoma cell line with osteoblast-like properties. We have recently shown (Morales, O., Lindgren, U., and Haldosen, L. A. (2000) J. Bone Miner. Res.15, 2284–2290) that UMR 106 cells express a GH-responsive JAK2/STAT5 signaling system. These cells also express the vitamin D receptor and respond to 1,25-(OH)2D3. In the present study we have investigated whether 1,25-(OH)2D3 influences GH signaling via the JAK2/STAT5 pathway in UMR 106 cells. We found that 1,25-(OH)2D3 prolonged GH signaling via the JAK2/STAT5 pathway. Pretreatment of cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 was also necessary in order to detect GH-induced STAT5 transcriptional response. Furthermore, the pretreatment of cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3rendered to the cells the capacity to respond to repetitive GH-stimulation. In UMR 106 cells, GH induced the expression of the JAK/STAT negative regulatory proteins SOCS-3 and CIS. Interestingly, pretreatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3inhibited GH-induced expression of these proteins. From these results we propose that 1,25-(OH)2D3 has an inhibitory effect on negative regulatory pathways acting on JAK2 and/or STAT5 in UMR 106 cells and that this, in all or partly, explains the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on GH-signaling via the JAK/STAT pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1987474661,"The adapter protein FADD consists of two protein interaction domains and is an essential component of the death inducing signaling complex (DISC) that is formed by activated death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family. The FADD death domain binds to activated receptors such as Fas or other adapters such as TRADD, whereas the FADD death effector domain binds to procaspase 8. Each domain can interact with its target in the absence of the other domain, and this has led to the idea that the two domains function independently. FADD death domain interactions with Fas and TRADD are thought to occur on the same surface; however, the regulation of these interactions is poorly understood. We developed a modified reverse two-hybrid method that can identify mutations, which inhibit some protein-protein interactions without affecting other interactions. Using this method, we identified mutations in FADD that prevent binding to Fas but do not affect binding to TRADD. Surprisingly, these mutations were in the death effector domain rather than the death domain. To test whether the mutants function in mammalian cells, we expressed wild type or mutant FADD molecules in FADD-deficient cells. Wild type FADD rescued both Fas ligand- and TNF-dependent signaling, whereas the FADD death effector domain mutants rescued only TNF signaling.

Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). Procaspase 8 is then cleaved and activated through interactions with various proteins leading to apoptosis. The adapter protein FADD (2Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar) consists of two protein interaction domains. FADD binds to receptors or other adapters through its death domain and binds to procaspase 8 through its death effector domain. The recruitment of procaspase 8 to the DISC is thought to result in the autoactivation of the caspase. FADD binds directly to Fas to activate caspase 8 in response to Fas ligand and binds the adapter protein TRADD to activate caspase 8 in response to TNFα (1Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). Thus, the important interaction for caspase activation by Fas is between FADD and Fas death domains, whereas the corresponding interaction responsible for TNFα-induced caspase activation is between FADD and TRADD death domains. The solution structures of the death domain (amino acids 96–208) and the death effector domain (amino acids 1–81) of FADD have been solved (3Jeong E.J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.S. Kim K.S. J.

Both domains are globular structures consisting of six α-helices that are tethered together by a linker, which is thought to be flexible because it is sensitive to proteases (3Jeong E.J. Bang S.

These studies suggest that binding between death domains occurs through charge interactions. By contrast, binding between the death effector domains of FADD and procaspase 8 is the result of hydrophobic interactions (6Fesik S.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 273-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that the Fas-FADD and TRADD-FADD interactions occur on the same surface of the FADD death domain. Indeed, the mutations in helices 2 and 3 of the FADD death domain abolish interactions with both Fas and TRADD, although one mutation, FADD (R117A), seems to prevent binding to Fas only (7Bang S.

This view is supported by experiments showing that each domain in isolation can interact with its partner. For example, the isolated death domain can inhibit apoptosis by binding to activated Fas (8Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms through which FADD interactions are regulated in the context of the full-length protein are incompletely understood. Reverse two-hybrid screens identify mutations in proteins that result in a loss of protein-protein interactions (10Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 11Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, one typically uses in vitro mutagenesis to create a library of mutants of one of the components in a two-hybrid screen, either the DNA-binding domain (DBD) fusion plasmid or the activation domain (AD) fusion plasmid. The investigator then screens for the loss of two-hybrid interaction. The major problem with current reverse two-hybrid methods is that one commonly identifies mutations that prevent stable expression of the two-hybrid protein or that affect gross protein folding. Such mutants are often not useful for mechanistic studies. To help dissect FADD signaling, we developed a reverse two-hybrid system that identifies mutations, which specifically abolish interactions among particular partner proteins while requiring that the mutated protein still interacts with a different protein partner; thus, demanding that the mutant protein is stably expressed in its native conformation. Using this method, we identified mutations in FADD, which suggest that in contrast to current models, the FADD death effector domain regulates the interaction between FADD and Fas. The GAL1-TetR expression cassette was constructed by cloning the Tn10 Tet Repressor with two copies of the SV40 nuclear localization signal (one at the N-terminal and one C-terminal) between the GAL1 promoter and the ADH1 terminator. This GAL1-TetR expression cassette was then cloned into plasmid HO-poly-KanMX4-HO (9Voth W.P. Richards J.D. Shaw J.M. Stillman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E59-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which allows it to be integrated into the HO locus. To construct the TetO-ADE2 reporter, the promoter of the ADE2 gene was deleted and replaced with a promoter fragment containing TetO sites made by PCR amplification from strain YI584 (Bio101, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmid Gal4-DBD-(YIp-TRP1) was constructed by inserting a cassette with the ADH1 promoter, Gal4 DNA-binding domain, and ADH1 terminator from plasmid pAS2–1 (10Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) into pRS304 (11Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid LexA-DBD-(YIp-URA3) was constructed by first inserting the ADH1 promoter Gal4 DBD-ADH1 terminator cassette into plasmid pRS306 (11Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then replacing the Gal4 DBD with anEcoRI-HindIII fragment from pBTM116 (12Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) containing the LexA DBD. Plasmid pACT3, a YEp vector with a LEU2 marker, was constructed by modifying the polylinker of the pACT2 activation domain vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Plasmid Gal4-DBD-FAS containing amino acids 191–313 of human Fas was made by PCR amplifying nucleotides 571–939 of human Fas and inserting it into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of Gal4-DBD-(YIp-TRP1). The full-length TRADD cDNA was inserted into LexA-DBD-(YIp-URA3) at the EcoRI and BamHI sites to give LexA-DBD-TRADD. For pACT3-FADD, a PCR fragment with full-length FADD was inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pACT3. pCDNA3.1 Puro was constructed by replacing the Hygro gene of pCDNA3.1(+) Hygro with the Puro gene. FADD and FADD mutant cDNAs were cut from the pACT3 versions with EcoRI andXhoI and inserted into the same sites of pCDNA3.1 Puro.

The GAL80 gene in DY7088 (ade2 can1 his3 leu2 met15 trp1 ura3 LexA(op)-HIS3) was disrupted with agal80::hisG-URA3-hisG disrupter and converted to gal80::hisG after growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid (14Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The endogenous ade2 gene was next replaced with the TetO-ADE2 reporter, and theKanMX::GAL1-TetR reporter was integrated at the ho locus. Finally, GAL4 was knocked out with a gal4::hisG-URA3-hisGdisrupter and then converted togal4::hisG. A detailed description of LY26 construction is available upon request. The medium was prepared as described previously (15Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Transformations were done using the high efficiency lithium acetate method (16Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). The LY30 strain used in screening for FADD mutations was a derivative of LY26 with plasmids Gal4-DBD-FAS and LexA-DBD-TRADD integrated at the TRP1 andURA3 loci, respectively. To generate a randomly mutagenized library, FADD cDNA was PCR-amplified from pACT3-FADD using primers GAD-20 (5′-CGATGATGAAGATACCCCACC-3′) and ACT+40 (5′-ATGGTGCACGATGCACAG-3′) in the presence of 50 μmMnCl2 (17Uppaluri R. Towle H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were ethanol-precipitated then cotransformed with 1 μg of pACT3 linearized with EcoRI into LY30 using gap repair to create circular plasmids by recombination in yeast. Transformants were selected on −Trp−Leu−Ade−His + 1 mm 3-amino triazole plates (−Trp decreases background by retaining Gal4-DBD-FAS, and -Leu selects the prey plasmid). After 3 days, colonies were mated to SFY526 or DY6877. Diploids were selected on −Trp−Leu−Met media and tested for lacZ activity. True positives showing strong binding phenotypes were rescued into Escherichia coli and then reintroduced into yeast to verify the phenotype. A mutagenized FADD (R71A) library was made as before using pACT3-FADD (R71A) as template. The screen was performed in yeast strain AH109 (MATatrp1 leu2 his3 gal4 gal80 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 URA3::MEL1-lacZ CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) expressing Gal4-DBD-Fas. Approximately one million FADD (R71A) molecules were screened, and positive two-hybrid interaction was selected for on -Trp-Leu-Ade-His + 1 mm3-amino triazole medium. Seven clones showing strong LacZ activity were rescued into E. coli and then retested for two-hybrid interaction in strain SFY526. Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The FADD-deficient Jurkat cells (18)were stably transfected with linearized pCDNA3.1 Puro expressing wild type or mutant FADD cDNAs by electroporation and selected with puromycin. For induction of apoptosis, 3 ml of Jurkat cells (7.5 × 105 cells/ml) were treated with 2.0 ng/ml FasL (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 3 h or 25 ng/ml TNF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in the presence of 1 μg/ml cycloheximide for 3 h. Primary antibodies for Western blots were FADD (BD Transduction Laboratories), caspase 8, caspase 3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and β-actin (Sigma). Fas DISC immunoprecipitations were performed using 100 million Jurkat cells for each sample. Cells were treated with or without FLAG-tagged Fas ligand (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). Anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) then was added to all samples, and DISC immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (19Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Virmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46639-46646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Caspase 3 assays were performed as described previously (20Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We modified the yeast split hybrid system (21Shih H.M. Goldman P.S. DeMaggio A.J. Hollenberg S.M. Goodman R.H. Hoekstra M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13896-13901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to include reporters for two DBD fusion proteins (sometimes called ”baits“), similar to dual bait systems (Fig.1) (24Weber C.H. Vincenz C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The first bait fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain is used to detect loss of interaction via a dual reporter system. A two-hybrid interaction between the Gal4-DBD fusion and the AD fusion results in the expression of the Tn10 Tet repressor, which blocks transcription of ADE2 from theTetO-ADE2 reporter. Thus, the two-hybrid interaction with the Gal4-DBD fusion results in no ADE2 expression and an Ade− phenotype. A mutation that disrupts this interaction removesADE2 inhibition, and the yeast are able to grow in the absence of adenine. Thus, we can select for the loss of two-hybrid interaction by selecting for Ade+ yeast. The second bait protein, a LexA-DBD fusion, is used to eliminate mutations in the AD fusion plasmid that affect expression or stability of the AD protein fusion. Two-hybrid activation between the prey and the LexA-DBD fusions will activate the LexA(op)-HIS3 reporter, resulting in an His+ phenotype. Thus, specific mutations in the AD fusion that block interaction with partner 1 (the Gal4-DBD fusion) but maintain overall protein integrity, allowing interaction with partner 2 (the LexA-DBD fusion), can be selected as Ade+ His+ transformants (Fig.1C). Importantly, the sensitivity of both two-hybrid interactions can be titrated either with tetracycline, which modulates the activity of the Tet repressor (21Shih H.M. Goldman P.S. DeMaggio A.J. Hollenberg S.M. Goodman R.H. Hoekstra M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13896-13901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), or with 3-amino triazole, which increases the amount of HIS3 expression required for histidine prototrophy (10Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). This allows the identification of strong and weak mutant alleles for both interactions. To establish that the system works, plasmids with Gal4-DBD-FAS and LexA-DBD-TRADD were integrated into the yeast genome. Three activation domain plasmids, the empty AD vector, the AD-FADD (wild type) fusion, and the AD-FADD (R117A) mutant, were transformed and tested for two-hybrid interaction with Gal4-DBD-FAS and LexA-DBD-TRADD (Fig. 1D). When assayed on selective media, yeast carrying the empty AD vector do not activate the LexA (op)-HIS3 reporter and display an His− phenotype. Similarly, yeast expressing the AD-FADD (wild type) fusion have two-hybrid activation of the GAL1-TetR gene, resulting in the repression of the TetO-ADE2 reporter and an Ade− phenotype. The FADD (R117A) mutant binds to TRADD but is not able to bind to Fasin vitro (7Bang S. Jeong E.J. Kim I.K. Jung Y.K. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36217-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or in yeast (22Morgan M. Thorburn J. Thomas L. Maxwell T. Brothman A.R. Thorburn A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When tested in the dual bait two-hybrid strain, the AD-FADD (R117A) fusion interacts with LexA-DBD-TRADD, resulting in an His+ phenotype. Failure of AD-FADD (R117A) to interact with Gal4-DBD-FAS leads to no expression of TetR, resulting in ADE2 expression and an Ade+ phenotype. Thus, the differential interaction of the AD-FADD (R117A) mutant with the two baits results in an Ade+ His+ phenotype. To identify other FADD mutants that discriminate between Fas and TRADD, a library consisting of the GAL4 activation domain fused to a randomly mutated FADD molecule was generated through mutagenic PCR followed by gap repair in yeast. A screen of 23,500 mutant FADD molecules yielded 120 Ade+ His+ transformants. These colonies potentially represent mutations in FADD that do not bind to Fas but retain interaction with TRADD. Each transformant was mated to a strain carrying either aGAL1-lacZ or LexA-lacZ reporter, and the two-hybrid activation of these reporters was used both to eliminate false positives and to determine the strength of each interaction. Several plasmids showing strong binding phenotypes were assayed for their ability to bind to a GAL4-caspase 8 bait to ensure that the mutation was specific for the loss of Fas binding only. Plasmids encoding FADD molecules that show decreased binding to Fas but still bind to TRADD (Fig 2A) were sequenced. As the FADD-Fas interaction is mediated through death domain interactions, we expected to find mutations in the death domain of FADD. Surprisingly, the mutations mapped to the death effector domain (Fig. 2B). Histidine 59 was mutated to tyrosine (H59Y), arginine 71 was mutated to tryptophan (R71W), and arginine 72 was mutated to either cysteine (R72C) or histidine (R72H). These mutations are in surface amino acids that flank helix 5 of the FADD death effector domain (Fig. 2C). The mutations at positions 71 and 72 showed complete loss of binding to Fas, whereas the H59Y mutation showed intermediate levels as measured using a β-galactosidase reporter gene in the two-hybrid assay (Fig.2D). All of the mutations bound to TRADD and caspase 8 about as well as the wild type FADD protein. We used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate other amino acid substitutions at these positions. When Arg-72 was changed to either an alanine (R72A) or a glutamate (R72E) and was tested for interaction with Fas in yeast, both mutations prevented interaction (Fig. 2D). However, when the same substitutions were made at position 71 (R71A and R71E), only a change to alanine prevented interaction. All of the mutations interacted with TRADD and caspase 8 similar to wild type FADD with the exception of the R72E mutation, which bound to TRADD only. To test whether the mutations in FADD identified in yeast have a phenotype in mammalian cells, wild type FADD and two of the mutants (R71W and H59Y) isolated in yeast were expressed in FADD-deficient Jurkat I2.1 cells (23Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To verify stable expression, cell extracts were Western blotted with an anti-FADD antibody. Cell lines transfected with FADD or FADD mutants but not green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the parental FADD-deficient cells (I2.1) had a unique band with an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa corresponding to FADD protein (Fig. 3A). The FADD mutants were expressed at similar levels, which were slightly lower than those of endogenous FADD in wild type Jurkat A3 cells. Cell lines expressing the FADD cDNAs with mutations at amino acid 72 produced very little FADD protein and were not examined further. A FADD mutant that can bind to TRADD but not Fas should reconstitute TNFR1 signaling but not Fas signaling in the I2.1 cells. Because the I2.1 cells were made by treating with a mutagen and selecting for growth in high levels of Fas ligand (23Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), they may contain other mutations that affect downstream Fas signaling. This appeared to be the case because even when we expressed wild type FADD in these cells, the cytotoxicity in response to Fas or TNFα was significantly reduced compared with the parental A3 cells (data not shown). Therefore, to test whether our mutant FADD molecules function as predicted in mammalian cells, we assayed caspase processing because this is the immediate downstream response caused by FADD binding to Fas or TRADD. We treated the Jurkat cell lines with Fas ligand, which should result in the recruitment of FADD and activation of caspase 8 followed by activation of caspase 3. Wild type Jurkat A3 cells and cells expressing wild type FADD exhibited Fas ligand-dependent caspase 8 cleavage, whereas cells expressing GFP or R71W mutant version of FADD did not (Fig. 3B). The mutation from histidine to tyrosine at position 59 weakens but does not eliminate the interaction with Fas in yeast (Fig. 2D). Consistent with this finding, Jurkat cells expressing the H59Y mutant still showed some caspase 8 processing in response to Fas ligand. We next tested whether the mutants could mediate caspase 8 activation in response to TNFα. Caspase 8 was cleaved in wild type Jurkat cells and cells expressing wild type FADD and both FADD mutants but not in the parental I2.1 cells and the cells expressing GFP (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained when we monitored caspase 3 processing. ΤNFα treatment caused caspase 3 activation as determined by the appearance of the active cleaved form of the enzyme in parental cells and in FADD-deficient cells expressing wild type FADD or either of the point mutants. Conversely, caspase 3 processing in response to Fas ligand was observed only when wild type FADD was expressed. These data indicate that the FADD R71W and H59Y mutants are compromised in their ability to mediate Fas signaling but not TNFR signaling. This finding is consistent with the mutants retaining native conformation to allow interaction with TRADD but not with Fas. To directly test whether mutations in the FADD death effector domain prevented binding to Fas in mammalian cells, DISC immunoprecipitation assays were performed using I2.1 cells expressing GFP, wild type FADD, R71W, or H59Y mutants. We coprecipitated FADD at the Fas DISC in cells expressing wild type FADD but not cells expressing GFP or the R71W FADD mutant. Furthermore, consistent with the reduced binding of the H59Y mutant in yeast, a faint signal was observed with this mutant in DISC immunoprecipitates from Jurkat cells (Fig.4A). The recruitment and activation of caspase 8 via interaction with FADD leads to caspase 3 activation. Therefore, we treated the Jurkat cell lines with TNFα to further test whether TRADD-dependent signaling via FADD was functional in these cells. Cells expressing wild type FADD and both FADD mutants but not cells expressing GFP displayed caspase 3 activity (Fig. 4B). The FADD mutants were as effective (R71W) or more effective (H59Y) than the wild type protein at activating caspase 3 in response to TNFα. We next performed a screen for second-site mutations that compensate for loss of binding to Fas. We randomly mutagenized the R71A mutant, which cannot interact with Fas (Fig. 2D) and performed a forward two-hybrid screen to identify mutants that could now bind to Fas. Fig. 5A shows three second-site mutations, which allow the R71A mutant to bind to Fas as well as the wild type FADD protein. Interestingly, these mutations (E61K, L62F, and E65K) were in helix 5 of the death effector domain (Fig. 5B). Thus, a mutation in the loop between helices 5 and 6 of the death effector domain abolishes interaction between FADD and Fas, but further mutations in helix 5 rescue the interaction. These data further indicate that the death effector domain plays a role in mediating interaction between FADD and Fas and suggest that helix 5 is important in this response. In this paper, we describe a modified reverse two-hybrid system that permits the facile identification of mutations that inhibit some protein-protein interactions without affecting overall protein structure or binding to other proteins. Using this approach, we identified mutations in the death effector domain of FADD that prevent binding to Fas but do not alter binding to TRADD. FADD mutants that were identified using the reverse two-hybrid system showed the expected ability to reconstitute TNFR1 signaling but not Fas signaling when they were expressed in FADD-deficient Jurkat cells. These data indicate that the binding characteristics in yeast were mirrored in mammalian cells. The fact that mutations in the death effector domain of FADD prevent interaction with Fas suggests that current models for the formation of the DISC (24Weber C.H. Vincenz C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in which the FADD death domain functions independently of the death effector domain to bind Fas are oversimplified. Rather than functioning as two separate entities, we suggest that the death domain and the death effector domain of FADD work together to regulate Fas binding. A simple explanation for our results is that the FADD death effector domain directly participates in binding to Fas. Alternative mechanisms include an inhibitory effect of the death effector domain that is promoted by our mutations or an allosteric modification of the death domain by the death effector domain. Our results do not conclusively discriminate between these possibilities. However, the fact that we rescued the binding of the R71A mutant by introducing new mutations in helix 5 of the death effector domain suggest that it is the death effector domain itself and not an effect by the death effector domain on the death domain that is important. By performing structural studies using mutants similar to those identified with our screening method, it may be possible to determine how the death effector domain regulates death domain interactions. The death effector domain of FADD may also be involved in interaction with the TRAIL receptors where it is thought that DAP3, which binds to the death effector domain, is the adapter responsible for FADD recruitment (25Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our data also suggest that it may be possible to design drugs that specifically interfere with some but not all FADD interactions by searching for molecules that disrupt death domain interactions through an effect on the death effector domain. The yeast system might be a useful screening method for such molecules, which could be used to selectively inhibit signaling by some death receptors without affecting signaling from the other receptors that use FADD. The reverse two-hybrid system can be used to study any protein interactions that occur in yeast and should be generally useful for the identification of mutants that have specific protein binding characteristics. This may allow the generation of dominant negative mutants that selectively inhibit specific activities of a particular protein. In addition, the system may be generally useful for the identification of mutants that provide useful insights into the structural requirements for specific protein-protein interactions.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 1249-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The TRP protein is widely conserved throughout animal phylogeny (6Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 7Montell C.

However, the mechanisms of activation or regulation of TRP or TRP-related channels are still obscure. Yoon et al. (9Yoon J. Ben-Ami H.C. Hong Y.S. Park S. Strong L.L.R. Bowman J. Geng C. Baek K. Minke B. Pak W.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 649-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently described a new mutation in the trp gene,TrpP365, which confers on the mutant a set of phenotypes unlike any seen in previously isolated trpmutants. The TrpP365 mutants do not display photoreceptor responses that terminate prematurely during light stimulus, a phenotype that had been considered to be the defining hallmark of mutants in this gene (10Cosens D.J. Manning A. Nature. 1969; 224: 285-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 11Minke B., Wu, C.-F. Pak W.L. Nature. 1975; 258: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).TrpP365 responses are small but are maintained throughout the duration of light stimulus. The most striking feature ofTrpP365 mutants, however, is that their photoreceptors undergo rapid degeneration. Moreover, unlike any other known trp mutants, these TrpP365phenotypes are semidominant, i.e. TrpP365 heterozygotes also display mutant phenotypes though they are not as severe as those of homozygotes. From whole cell patch-clamp recordings, Yoon et al. (9Yoon J. Ben-Ami H.C. Hong Y.S. Park S. Strong L.L.R. Bowman J. Geng C. Baek K. Minke B. Pak W.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 649-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that these phenotypes arise as a result of excessive Ca2+entry caused by constitutive activity of the TRP channel. We now show that the above phenotypes are because of a single amino acid change, Phe-550 to Ile, in the fifth transmembrane segment of the TRP channel. We present, in addition, a possible mechanism by which the phenotypes might arise. Atrp minigene was constructed and subcloned into the pCaSpeR-3 vector for germ line transformation. The minigene consisted of three DNA fragments, the trp promoter and 5′-untranslated regions (−681 to −1 of genomic DNA, where +1 is the trptranslation start site), the coding region (ATG to the stop codon), and the 390-bp region immediately downstream of the stop codon. The minigene was subcloned into the XbaI and StuI sites of the CaSpeR-3 transformation vector. The vector containing the minigene was injected into early embryos in the presence of helper plasmid (12Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar). All four mutations detected in the TrpP365 mutant are located within a 2444-bpSmaI fragment (from +647 to +3090) in the trpcoding region. The 2444-bp SmaI fragment was isolated from wild-type trp cDNA, subcloned into the M13mp18 vector, and mutagenized as described in Kunkel (13Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The following primers were used in site-directed mutagenesis: P500T (mutation 1), 5′-GAACACTGCATACGTTTGATCCA;H532N (mutation 2), 5′-CCATTAATCCCAACCTGGGACCCT; F550I (mutation 3), 5′-CATCAAGTTCATCTTCATCTACA; and S867F (mutation 4), 5′-TACTTTCGCCTTCGATCCCATTGG, where the target bases are underlined. Following mutagenesis, the SmaI fragments were sequenced to ascertain only the intended mutations had been induced. Each mutagenized SmaI fragment was then swapped with the corresponding SmaI fragment in the trp minigene, which had previously been cloned into pCaSpeR-3. The following nine mutant trp minigene constructs were generated, and transgenic flies carrying each mutant minigene were generated by P-element-mediated germ line transformation in a wild-type background: P[trp (1Hardie R.C. Minke B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 613-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar)], with mutation 1; P[trp (2Peretz A. Suss-Toby E. Rom-Glas A. Arnon A. Payne R. Minke B. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1257-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)], with mutation 2; P[trp (3Peretz A. Sandler C. Kirschfeld K. Hardie R. Minke B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1057-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)], with mutation 3; P[trp (4Hardie R.C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1371-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)], with mutation 4; P[trp (123)], with mutations 1, 2, and 3; P[trp (124)], with mutations 1, 2,and 4; P[trp (134)], with mutations 1, 3, and 4; P[trp (234)], with mutations 2, 3, and 4; and P[trp(1234)], with all four mutations. In addition to these transgenic lines in a wild-type background, three of the lines, that carrying mutation 3, that carrying mutations 1, 2, and 4, and that carrying all four mutations, were also placed in atrp-null (trpP343) background by appropriate genetic crosses. The trpP343 mutant was generated in this laboratory and was shown by others (14Scott K. Sun Y. Beckingham K. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 375-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) to be functionally null. Fly eyes were dissected in a fixative (4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.3% Triton X-100), and the dissected retinas (photoreceptor layers) were allowed to remain in the same fixative for 1 h. After incubation in phosphate-buffered saline that contained 4% normal goat serum, the fixed retinas were stained with phalloidin-tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (Sigma) to label filamentous actin in the rhabdomeres. Transverse optical sections of ∼1 μm thickness were taken ∼6 μm from the distal tips of the rhabdomeres. Yoon et al. (9Yoon J. Ben-Ami H.C. Hong Y.S. Park S. Strong L.L.R. Bowman J. Geng C. Baek K. Minke B. Pak W.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 649-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that theTrpP365 mutant carries four protein sequence-altering mutations within its trp gene, P500T, H531N, F550I, and S867F. To simplify notations, these mutations will be referred to as mutations 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. To determine which of these four mutations is responsible for theTrpP365 phenotype, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on a trp minigene to generate mutants carrying each of the four mutations singly, three of the four in all possible triplet combinations, or all four mutations together. The resulting mutant minigene constructs were introduced into a wild-type background by P-element-mediated germ line transformation (see “Experimental Procedures”). A single copy of the trp minigene, which has no introns, was found to fully complement the trp mutant phenotype when introduced into the null trpP343background (not shown). Shown in Fig. 1 are electroretinograms (ERGs),1 extracellularly recorded, light-evoked mass responses of the eye, obtained from transgenic flies each carrying a single copy of the recombinanttrp minigene harboring mutation 1, 2, 3, or 4,i.e. P[trp (1Hardie R.C. Minke B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 613-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar)]/+, P[trp(2)]/+, P[trp(3)]/+, or P[trp(4)]/+, all in a wild-type background. Thus, these transgenic flies had two copies of the endogenous wild-type trp gene and one copy of the mutagenized recombinant trp minigene. ERGs of P[trp(1)]/+, P[trp(2)]/+, or P[trp(4)]/+ were indistinguishable from those of wild-type (Fig. 1, a, b, and d). Only those obtained from P[trp(3)]/+ were distinctly different from wild-type ERGs in that they showed markedly slower kinetics of decay at stimulus off-set (Fig. 1c). There was little variation in the ERG decay times among individuals of P[trp(3)]/+ so that the P[trp(3)]/+ ERG could always be distinguished from that of wild-type by inspection. Yoonet al. (9Yoon J. Ben-Ami H.C. Hong Y.S. Park S. Strong L.L.R. Bowman J. Geng C. Baek K. Minke B. Pak W.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 649-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown previously that one copy ofTrpP365 introduced into a wild-type background causes the ERGs of the transgenic host to become somewhat smaller in amplitude and slower in the kinetics of decay than those of wild-type. Thus, the slow time courses of decay observed in this study were consistent with the previous findings, although little or no change in amplitudes was detected in the present study. We next made the P[trp (3Peretz A. Sandler C. Kirschfeld K. Hardie R. Minke B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1057-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)] transgene homozygous so that the transgenic flies now carried two copies of P[trp(3)] and two copies of the endogenous wild-type trp gene. The main effect of making P[trp(3)] homozygous on the ERG was to slow down the kinetics of response decay even further (Fig.2a). Thus, mutation 3 was the only one of the four that had any effect at all on the ERG, suggesting that mutation 3, i.e. F550I, might be the primary contributor to the TrpP365 mutant ERG phenotype. To examine to what extent the other three mutations might play a role in producing the TrpP365phenotype, we generated transgenic flies carrying various triplet combinations of the four mutations (123, 124, 134, and 234) or all four mutations together (1234). These transgenic lines, too, were made homozygous for the transgene so that each carried two copies of the transgene and two copies of the endogenous trp+gene. ERGs obtained from three of the triplet combination lines, P[trp(123)], P[trp(134)], and P[trp(234)], were very similar to each other, with slow decay time courses much like that seen in P[trp(3)] flies (compare Fig. 2, c and a). For this reason, an ERG obtained from only one of these three lines, P[trp(123)], is shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, ERGs of transgenic flies of the P[trp(124)] line, the only line that did not carry mutation 3, were completely wild-type (Fig.2d). Thus, whenever the transgenic flies carried mutation 3, whether by itself or in combination with the other mutations, their ERGs were mutant, and whenever they did not carry mutation 3 their ERGs were wild-type. The results were clear-cut in suggesting that 1) mutation 3 alone was sufficient to generate the mutant phenotype, and 2) the other mutations contributed very little to the mutant phenotype. All transgenic lines tested to this point were generated in a wild-type background. Therefore, they were not genotypically comparable withTrpP365/+ because of the presence of endogenoustrp+, even though the ratio of mutant to wild-type trp gene copy number was one, as inTrpP365/+ (2:2 in the transgenic flies and 1:1 in TrpP365/+). In fact, ERGs of all transgenic flies carrying two copies of mutation 3 tested were not nearly as severely mutant as that of TrpP365/+ (compare Fig. 2, a–c and Fig.3b), suggesting that the presence of the extra wild-type copies of the trp gene might be influencing the ERG phenotype. To assess properly whether or not mutation 3 corresponds toTrpP365/+, we needed to carry out a complementation test in the absence of the endogenous wild-typetrp. Accordingly, we placed the P[trp(3)] and P[trp(1234)] transgenes in a trp-null (trpP343) background. As a positive control, the P[trp(124)] transgene was also placed in atrp-null background. If mutation 3, indeed, is the same asTrpP365, one would expect that transgenic flies homozygous for a transgene harboring mutation 3 would display phenotypes closely resembling those of TrpP365. If mutation 3 is absent from the transgene, on the other hand, one would expect the transgene to fully complement the trp-null background. Fig. 3 compares the ERGs obtained from TrpP365heterozygotes and homozygotes (Fig. 3, b and e, respectively) with those obtained from transgenic flies homozygous for the transgenes harboring mutation 3 alone (P[trp(3)]) (Fig. 3c), all four mutations together (P[trp(1234)]) (Fig. 3d), or the only triplet combination that does not include mutation 3 (P[trp(124)]) (Fig. 3a), all placed in a trpP343background. ERGs were tested at three different ages, 0, 3, and 7 days post-eclosion. Because ERGs showed very little age-dependent variations, particularly between 3 and 7 days post-eclosion, results from 7 days were not included in Fig. 3. They were very similar to those at 3 days post-eclosion. At all three ages tested, the ERGs obtained from transgenic flies carrying (P[trp(124)]) were completely wild-type (Fig.3a). That is, the transgene completely complemented the nulltrp background when it harbored all the other three mutations but not mutation 3. The ERGs of transgenic flies carrying transgenes P[trp(3)] and P[trp(1234)], on the other hand, were both much more severely mutant than those ofTrpP365/+ heterozygotes and approached those ofTrpP365 homozygotes in severity. There was a tendency for ERGs of flies carrying mutation 3 alone to be somewhat less severe than those of flies carrying all four mutations (compare Fig. 3, c and d), but even the latter did not quite match ERGs of TrpP365 in severity (compare Fig. 3, d and e). At least four different transgenic lines were tested for each genotype, and the above generalizations held true across different transgenic lines, making it unlikely that the minor differences in phenotype between the transgenic flies and the original mutant are due to differences in the sites of insertion of transgenes. Thus, the results of the complementation test were consistent with the idea that mutation 3, and it alone, corresponds to the originalTrpP365 mutation, although mutation 3 alone never quite matched the severity of TrpP365 in ERG phenotypes. The slight disparity between behaviors of the transgenes and TrpP365 will be discussed under “Discussion.” To determine whether the ERG phenotypes of these mutants are accompanied by photoreceptor degeneration and whether mutation 3 alone is sufficient to cause degeneration, we carried out confocal microscopy. Microscopy was performed on the retinas of the same five classes of flies that were tested for their ERGs (Fig. 3), as well as wild-type and null trp mutant (trpP343) flies, at 0, 3, and 7 days post-eclosion. The retinas were stained with phalloidin to label filamentous actin in the rhabdomeres. As may be seen in Fig.4A, the rhabdomeres appeared normal in both wild-type flies (Fig. 4A-a) andtrpP343 null mutants (Fig. 4A-b), as well as transgenic flies carrying mutations 1, 2, and 4, (Fig.4A-c), at all three ages. InTrpP365/+ heterozygotes, however, the rhabdomeres of some ommatidia began showing abnormalities by day 3. Some rhabdomeres looked elongated in cross section, and some seemed to be breaking up in two (Fig. 4B-a, middle panel,arrows). By day 7, most rhabdomeres were diffusely labeled, indicating that they were no longer structurally intact, and most ommatidia no longer showed a full complement of seven rhabdomeres (Fig.4B-a, right panel). InTrpP365 homozygotes, only faint diffuse images of a few isolated rhabdomeres were detectable even at day 0 post-eclosion (Fig. 4B-d, left panel). The degeneration phenotypes of the two classes of transgenic flies, P[trp(3)] and P[trp(1234)] (Fig.4B-b and -c, respectively), were intermediate between those of TrpP365 homozygotes and heterozygotes but more closely resembled that of homozygotes than that of heterozygotes. The resemblance to TrpP365homozygotes was much stronger than was evident from ERG recordings. Thus, the degree of degeneration in transgenic flies carrying all four mutations was almost indistinguishable from that of homozygotes, particularly at days 3 and 7 post-eclosion (compare Fig. 4,B-c and -d). Degeneration in the transgenic flies carrying only mutation 3 was somewhat milder. At day 0 post-eclosion, most rhabdomeres appeared nearly normal. However, the label was very faint, and some rhabdomeres appeared to be splitting up (Fig. 4B-b, left panel, arrow). By day 3, most rhabdomeres were no longer detectable, and only a few isolated, faintly labeling rhabdomeres remained. This was in strong contrast toTrpP365/+, in which most rhabdomeres labeled distinctly even at day 7. Transgenic flies carrying mutations 1, 2, and 4 had completely normal rhabdomeres at all three ages tested (Fig.4A-c). These results were completely consistent with ERG results (Fig. 3) except that transgenic flies carrying mutation 3 alone more closely resembled the original TrpP365mutation than in ERG recordings. By whole cell recordings from dissociated photoreceptor cells, Yoon et al. (9Yoon J. Ben-Ami H.C. Hong Y.S. Park S. Strong L.L.R. Bowman J. Geng C. Baek K. Minke B. Pak W.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 649-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed earlier that inTrpP365 the TRP Ca2+ channels are constitutively open, suggesting that the excessive influx of Ca2+ through the TRP channels causes the massive photoreceptor degeneration observed in the mutant. These authors proposed that the mutation(s) in the trp gene ofTrpP365 renders the regulation of the TRP channel unstable, leading to an increased likelihood that the channels open and remain open spontaneously in an age-dependent andTrpP365 dosage-dependent manner. Their results thus suggested that the amino acid residues that are altered in the TRP channel of TrpP365 might be important for the regulation of the TRP channel activity. We have shown in the present work that, of the four amino acid alterations detected in the TRP channel of TrpP365 (9Yoon J. Ben-Ami H.C. Hong Y.S. Park S. Strong L.L.R. Bowman J. Geng C. Baek K. Minke B. Pak W.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 649-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the F550I change in the fifth transmembrane segment is the critical mutation for the TrpP365 phenotype. The ERG and degeneration phenotypes of transgenic flies homozygous for mutation 3 alone or all four mutations together nearly approximate the phenotypes of TrpP365 homozygotes when the transgenes are placed in a trp-null background (P[trp (3Peretz A. Sandler C. Kirschfeld K. Hardie R. Minke B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1057-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)];trpP343 and P[trp(1234)];trpP343) (Figs. 3 and4). However, these phenotypes do not quite attain the severity ofTrpP365 homozygotes (Figs. 3 and 4). Moreover, the phenotypes of transgenic flies carrying only mutation 3 tend to be slightly milder than those of transgenic flies carrying all four mutations (compare Fig. 3, c and d; Fig. 4,B-b and -c). Because these behaviors of transgenes are observed in several different lines of transgenic flies for each transgene, they are not likely to be due to differences in expression levels arising from different sites of transgene insertion. On the other hand, the transgenes had a trp promoter sequence of only ∼680 bp and were devoid of introns (see “Experimental Procedures”). This use of abbreviated gene constructs in the transgenes could potentially account for the minor differences in behavior between the mutation 3-harboring transgenes and the original TrpP365 mutation. The abbreviated gene construct could, for example, affect the level of protein expression or the processing of gene products. The effects appear to be weak because the observed differences are only minor. On the other hand, the slight difference in ERG and degeneration phenotypes between transgenic flies carrying mutation 3 alone and those carrying all four mutations cannot be explained either by differences in sites of transgene integration or the abbreviated gene constructs used in transgenes. It may well be that mutations 1, 2, and 4 have minor synergistic effects on mutation 3, even though alone they do not produce any phenotype. The fact remains, however, that mutation 3 must be present for the mutant phenotypes to appear at all (Figs. 1, 2, 3a, and4A-c). Moreover, mutation 3 alone is sufficient to produce phenotypes closely mimicking those of TrpP365(Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). That is, mutation 3 alone is necessary for the ERG and degeneration phenotypes of TrpP365 and sufficient for phenotypes closely matching those ofTrpP365. We conclude that, in all likelihood, mutation 3 corresponds to the original mutationTrpP365. The amino acid alteration caused by mutation 3 is surprisingly subtle considering the drastic effect it has on the mutant phenotype. It involves the substitution of one non-polar residue for another. Alignment of the TRP S5 sequence with those of other TRP-related channel subunits shows that Phe-550 of TRP is conserved in S5 sequences of all fly TRPs but not all other invertebrate TRP-related proteins tested (Fig. 5). In the twoCaenorhabditis elegans TRP-related proteins examined, this position is occupied by Phe in one, as in flies, and Cys in the other. On the other hand, in all mammalian TRP-related proteins tested (a total of 14 mammalian TRP sequences) a conserved Leu residue occupies this position (Fig. 5). In no case, however, is this position occupied by Ile. The following are some tentative conclusions from these and the previous observations. 1) This position is important for the regulation of TRP channel opening. 2) The particular amino acid residue preferred for this position appears to be different for different species, Phe for Drosophila and Leu for mammals, perhaps because of slightly different channel environments. 3) Ile appears to be particularly poorly tolerated at this position. In the following, we explore speculatively why this position might be important for the regulation of TRP channel opening and why Ile, in particular, may be a poor residue to occupy this position. In a classic study, Doyle et al. (16Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar) determined the structure of the KcsA K+ channel of Streptomyces lividens by x-ray crystallography. The KcsA channel is formed by four subunits, each of which contributes two transmembrane α-helices, one (inner helix) facing the pore and the other (outer helix) facing the hydrophobic membrane; these α-helices form the backbone of the channel. The four inner helices are arranged like the posts of an inverted teepee and cross in a bundle to produce a small hole near the intracellular entrance of the channel. Results of Cys accessibility studies (17Liu Y. Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1997; 19: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) on voltage-gated Shaker K+ channels suggest that the hole formed by the bundle crossing serves as the gate for these channels. This picture of the channel structure probably applies to such other ion channels as various voltage-gated channels and TRP-related channels. Most of these channels, however, have six transmembrane segments, rather than two, in each subunit or homology domain. For these channels, the sixth transmembrane segment, S6, corresponds to the inner helix, and the fifth transmembrane segment, S5, corresponds to the outer helix of the KacsA channel. Thus, while the S5 segments do not define the channel gate themselves, they are immediately adjacent to S6 segments and are in a position to influence the movements of S6 segments. Hydropathy analysis places Phe-550 near the N-terminal end of S5, corresponding to the intracellular end of the segment. This is also the region of the channel at which S6 segments are thought to make bundle crossing to form the gate. Thus, the residues at positions 550 or in its immediate vicinity may be in a position to critically affect channel gating. Why would Ile at this position cause constitutive activity of the channel but not the residues normally found at this position? It turns out that Ile has a side chain property that it does not share with Phe, Leu, or Cys. Ile is branched at the β-carbon position, whereas none of the other three has ramifications at the β-position. Branching at β is expected to decrease the flexibility of the main chain through steric hindrance provided by the β-branched side chains (15Schulz G.E. Schirmer R.H. Cantor C.R. Principles of Protein Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1985: 11Google Scholar). The presence of a β-branched residue close to the gate may restrict the movements of the helices forming the gate and could lock the gate in its resting state. Agam et al. (18Agam K. von Campenhausen M. Levy S. Ben-Ami H.C. Cook B. Kirschfeld K. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5748-5755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the default state of the TRP and TRPL channels is the open state and that a continuous energy input from an ATP-dependent process is required to keep the channels closed in the absence of light stimulus. Thus, constitutive opening of the TRP channel may represent locking the channel in the lower-energy, default state, i.e. its resting state.

Native VAO has a covalently bound FAD and forms primarily octameric assemblies of 507 kDa. H61T is purified as a FAD-free apoprotein and mainly exists as a dimeric species of 126 kDa. Binding of FAD to apoH61T rapidly restores enzyme activity and induces octamerization, although association of H61T dimers seems not to be crucial for enzyme activity. Reconstitution of H61T with the cofactor analog 5′-ADP also promotes octamerization. FMN on the other hand, interacts with apoH61T without stimulating dimer association. These results are in line with observations made for several other flavoenzymes, which contain a Rossmann fold. Members of the VAO flavoprotein family do not contain a Rossmann fold but do share two conserved loops that are responsible for binding the pyrophosphate moiety of FAD. Therefore, the observed FAD-induced oligomerization might be general for this family. We speculate that upon FAD binding, small conformational changes in the ADP-binding pocket of the dimeric VAO species are transmitted to the protein surface, promoting oligomerization.

We speculate that upon FAD binding, small conformational changes in the ADP-binding pocket of the dimeric VAO species are transmitted to the protein surface, promoting oligomerization. vanillyl-alcohol oxidase Riboflavin (vitamin B2) derivatives such as FAD and FMN are essential components of all living organisms, serving as cofactors for numerous proteins with diverse functions, ranging from electron transport, redox catalysis, oxygen activation, and light emission to DNA repair (1Massey V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 283-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For most reported flavoproteins, the flavin cofactor is noncovalently bound, although ∼10% of human cellular FAD is covalently linked to enzymes like monoamine oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase (2Decker K.F.

For several flavoenzymes, binding of the FAD cofactor induces subunit association and improves the resistance of the protein to thermal and chemical denaturation. Thus, for glucose oxidase (11Swoboda B.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 175: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), d-amino-acid oxidase (12Massey V. Curti B. J. Biol.

For bacterial butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase on the other hand, it was revealed that optimal reconstitution of tetrameric holoenzyme from dimeric apoenzyme and FAD requires the presence of CoA ligands (16Van Berkel W.J.H. Van den Berg W.A. Müller F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For obvious reasons, little is known about the role of flavin binding in the assembly of covalent flavoenzymes (17Kim J. Fuller J.H. Kuusk V. Cunane L. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. McIntire W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31202-31209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Covalent flavinylation mostly occurs via a histidine residue, but enzymes with cysteinyl-flavin, tyrosyl-flavin, and threonyl-flavin have been described as well (3Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO)1 from Penicillium simplicissimum is a covalent flavoprotein, whereby the FAD is bound via a so-called (8α-(N 3-histidyl)-FAD) linkage (18Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). VAO is active with a wide variety of phenolic compounds (19Fraaije M.W. Veeger C. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20van den Heuvel R.H. Fraaije M.W. Laane C. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5646-5651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the biological function of the enzyme is unclear. Upon growth on 4-methoxymethylphenol, VAO is abundantly expressed in the fungus, which might suggest that the main physiological role of the enzyme is the conversion of this compound into 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (21Fraaije M.W. Pikkemaat M.G. van Berkel W.J.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 435-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VAO is primarily a homooctamer of about 0.5 million Da (22de Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. de Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. van Berkel W.J.H.

Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The larger domain binds the FAD in an extended conformation, whereas the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin is covalently attached to His-422 of the cap domain (18Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A.

Sequence comparisons have revealed that VAO belongs to a novel class of widely distributed oxidoreductases, sharing a conserved FAD-binding domain (25Fraaije M.W. Van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The functional role of the covalent protein-flavin linkage in VAO has been addressed recently (26Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35514-35520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis. From the properties of His-422 mutants, evidence was obtained that the covalent linkage between His-422 and the apoprotein is important for VAO catalysis by raising the redox potential of the flavin. All three mutants H422A, H422C, and H422T tightly bind the FAD in a noncovalent mode, but the change in redox properties results in a marked decrease in the rate of substrate-mediated flavin reduction. The mechanism of flavinylation of VAO was addressed by creation of the design point mutation His-61 → Thr (27Fraaije M.W. van Den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38654-38658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the mutant enzyme, the covalent linkage between His-422 and the flavin is not formed, whereas the enzyme is still able to bind FAD and perform catalysis. Structural analysis of both the apo- and holo-forms of H61T indicated that binding of FAD to the apoprotein does not induce major structural rearrangements, suggesting that covalent flavinylation is an autocatalytic process in which His-61 is crucially involved in activating His-422. As for the wild-type enzyme the apo-form of H61T is present as an homooctamer in the crystalline state (27Fraaije M.W. van Den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38654-38658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, preliminary gel filtration studies have indicated that in solution, the mutant enzyme may easily dissociate into dimers. In this report we use primarily mass spectrometry to probe the influence of cofactor binding on the oligomerization state of VAO. With the development of new ionization techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (28Karas M. Hillenkamp F. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 2299-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (4805) Google Scholar) and electrospray ionization (29Fenn J.B. Mann M. Meng C.K. Wong S.F. Whitehouse C.M. Science. 1989; 246: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar), and the coupling of these to time-of-flight analyzers, the detectable mass range of macromolecular systems by mass spectrometry has been enhanced extensively (30McLafferty F.W.

Moreover, the relatively gentle phase transfer from solution to the gas phase, realized especially by electrospray ionization, has allowed the intact detection by mass spectrometry of larger multiprotein assemblies (32Ganem B., Li, Y.T.

Biomolecular mass spectrometry combines mass resolution, high sensitivity, and an enlarged mass-to-charge (m/z) range and allows the identification of multiple species in a mixture. In an earlier report (42van Berkel W.J.H. van den Heuvel R.H.H. Versluis C. Heck A.J.R.

Here we compare wild-type VAO and the single point mutant H61T. In the mutant enzyme, the FAD cofactor is no longer covalently bound, and the protein can be prepared in its FAD-free apo-form. The apoprotein has a moderate affinity for FAD and 5′-ADP (27Fraaije M.W. van Den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol.

FAD, FMN, and 5′-ADP were obtained from Sigma and used without further purification. Ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography resins were from Amersham Biosciences.

Proteins stored in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, were desalted using ultrafiltration units (ultrafree-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Device, Millipore Corp.) with a cut-off of 5000 Da. The apo-form of H61T VAO was prepared by hydroxyapatite chromatography. 4 mg of H61T VAO in 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, containing 200 μm FAD, was applied onto a 1-ml hydroxyapatite column, pre-equilibrated in 200 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Protein-bound FAD was then removed by washing the column with 10 column volumes of starting buffer. The apoprotein was eluted from the column with 15 column volumes of 600 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and concentrated to 4 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Ultrafree 4, 30 kDa). The FAD content of the apoprotein was <0.1% as evidenced by absorption spectral analysis. The molar absorption coefficient of apoH61T VAO was determined at 280 nm by comparison of the absorbance of apoenzyme, holoenzyme, and free FAD in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Varian Eclipse instrument. All spectrometers were equipped with thermostat cell holders. All spectra were obtained at 25 °C. Reconstitution of holoH61T from apoH61T and FAD was performed at 0 and 25 °C in 50 mmammonium acetate, pH 6.8. The apoenzyme concentration was 3 μm, and the FAD concentration was 100 μm. At time intervals, the reconstitution reaction was monitored by adding an aliquot of the incubation mixture into the assay mixture. The activity of H61T was determined by measuring absorption changes at 296 nm (ε296 = 5.5 mm−1cm−1) due to the hydroxylation of eugenol to coniferyl alcohol at pH 7.5 (43van den Heuvel R.H.H. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14799-14808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 560 nm using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. A spectral bandwidth of 5 nm was used in all fluorescence experiments. Binding of FAD to apoH61T VAO was monitored by the decrease of protein fluorescence at 340 nm. In titration studies, after each addition the sample was incubated for 4 min in the dark before measuring the emission intensity. For nano-electrospray mass spectrometry experiments, enzyme samples were prepared in aqueous 50 mm ammonium acetate solutions. For measurements under denaturing conditions, these protein solutions were 1:1 diluted in acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid. VAO samples were introduced into an LC-T nano-electrospray ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK), operating in positive ion mode. Source pressure conditions in the LC-T mass spectrometer and nano-electrospray voltages were optimized for optimal transmission of the larger multimer protein assemblies as described previously (44Tahallah N. Pinkse M.W.H. Maier C.S. Heck A.J.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Spraying conditions are as follows: needle voltage 1450–1650 V, cone voltage 45–100 V, and source temperature 85 °C. In the experiments measuring the protein assemblies, the pressure in the interface region was adjusted by reducing the pumping capacity of the rotary pump by closing the valve. Borosilicate glass capillaries (Kwik-FilTM, World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL) were used on a P-97 puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) to prepare the nano-electrospray needles. They were subsequently coated with a thin gold layer (∼500 Å) using an Edwards Scancoat six Pirani 501 sputter coater (Edwards High Vacuum International, Crawley, UK). Size-exclusion chromatography was performed with a Superdex-200 HR 10/30 column connected to an Åkta chromatography system, essentially as described previously (23Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. van Berkel W.J.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. 3 μm apoH61T (or wild-type VAO) was incubated at room temperature in the absence or presence of cofactor analogs (30 μm FAD, 30 μm 5′-ADP, or 30 μm FMN). At different time intervals, 200-μl aliquots from the incubation mixtures were injected on the column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Detection was at 220 nm. Relative abundance of the dimer and octamer species was calculated from the peak areas. To derive the relative abundance of the octamer and dimer, these peak areas were scaled (corrected for the number of subunits) by dividing the area of the octamer by 8 and that of the dimer by 2. The noncovalent and relatively weak binding of FAD to H61T VAO (27Fraaije M.W. van Den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38654-38658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) allowed a novel gentle procedure of preparing the apoenzyme. By binding the H61T mutant to hydroxyapatite, the FAD could easily and quantitatively be removed by washing the column with 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Subsequently, the apoenzyme was stripped from the column by increasing the buffer concentration to 600 mm. This method of apoenzyme preparation is very simple, can be performed at a small and large scale, and gives almost quantitative yields. The absorption spectrum of apoH61T in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, showed a maximum at 280 nm and no significant absorbance in the visible region, revealing that the FAD is indeed absent (Fig.1 A). The molar absorption coefficient at 280 nm, ε280, was estimated to be 140 ± 1 mm−1 cm−1. For comparison the absorption spectrum of wild-type VAO in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, is shown in Fig. 1 A as well. In an earlier study, the dissociation constant of the complex between apoH61T VAO and FAD in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was estimated to be 1.8 μm (27Fraaije M.W. van Den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38654-38658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In view of the mass spectrometry studies described below, it was of interest to obtain insight in the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the apoenzyme-FAD complex in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. Reconstitution of apoH61T by FAD, as monitored by activity measurements, was a relatively fast process. When 3 μm apoenzyme was incubated with 100 μm FAD at 25 °C, the enzyme activity reached a maximum within 1 min. When excess FAD (50 μm) was included in the assay mixture, the maximum activity approximated the activity of the H61T holoenzyme (27Fraaije M.W. van Den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38654-38658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At 0 °C, the reconstitution reaction was slower and took about 5 min to complete. Again, under these conditions the activity reached the level of the H61T holoenzyme when the assay was performed in the presence of 50 μm FAD. Fig. 1 B shows the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum of apoH61T upon excitation at 295 nm. The relative quantum yield of the tryptophan fluorescence of apoH61T is much higher than that of wild-type VAO and holoH61T (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, the maximum of fluorescence emission of apoH61T VAO is at 340 nm, whereas the emission maxima of wild-type VAO and holoH61T are centered around 325 nm. In line with the data from activity experiments, binding of FAD to apoH61T was a relatively fast process. When 3 μm apoH61T was incubated at 25 °C with a 10-fold excess of FAD, the fluorescence emission at 340 nm was quenched by about 80% and reached a constant value within 30 s. At 0 °C, the same level of fluorescence quenching was observed, but the reaction took ∼5 min to complete. The dissociation constant of the complex between apoH61T and FAD was determined by fluorescence titration experiments. Titration of 3 μm apoH61T by FAD resulted in a strong decrease of tryptophan fluorescence emission at 340 nm (Fig.2). From the titration data, a dissociation constant, K d = 0.38 ± 0.04 μm, and a relative quantum yield, Q = 20 ± 2% with respect to apoH61T, was estimated for the apoenzyme-FAD complex. This is slightly tighter binding than reported previously (27Fraaije M.W. van Den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38654-38658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which might be due to the different buffer system. Titration of apoH61T with 5′-ADP did not result in a strong fluorescence decrease (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the fluorescence quenching data support an earlier conclusion (27Fraaije M.W. van Den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38654-38658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that 5′-ADP binds to apoH61T with a similar affinity as FAD. When apoH61T was titrated with FMN, a clear change in protein fluorescence emission was observed (Fig.2). However, the fluorescence quenching did not reach a constant value, suggesting that FMN binds far more weakly to apoH61T than FAD and 5′-ADP. Initially to check the quality of the recombinant VAO proteins, the molecular masses of the protein monomers were determined. To that end, the protein of interest was dissolved in a denaturing acidic solution (containing 50% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid). Under these highly acidic conditions, quaternary structures are most often disassembled, and proteins tend to denature, and the relatively highly charged ions originating from the monomer proteins are observed in the mass spectra. From these nanoelectrospray mass spectra, the mass of the protein monomer can be assessed. From such data the average molecular weight of the wild-type VAO monomer was determined to be 63,561 ± 3 Da. Translation of the gene sequence published by Benen et al.(24Benen J.A. Sanchez-Torres P. Wagemaker M.J. Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Visser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7865-7872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) leads to a protein mass of 62,915 Da, excluding the covalently bound FAD. When including the mass of FAD, the measured and expected mass are in agreement, when it is assumed that the N-terminal methionine has been post-translationally removed. The average molecular mass of the apo-form of the VAO H61T variant was determined to be 62,742 ± 2 Da. The experimental mass difference between the wild-type and the apoVAO H61T mutant is as expected, when the single mutation and the covalently bound FAD are taken into account, and again when it also assumed that the initiator methionine is processed in the apoVAO H61T mutant. Analysis of tryptic digests by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight proved indeed the truncation of the methionine in both the wild-type and the apoVAO H61T mutant (data not shown). Additionally, our mass spectrometric data confirmed that no residual covalent FAD was present in the apoprotein (27Fraaije M.W. van Den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38654-38658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In order to establish the stoichiometry of the VAO assemblies, mass spectra of the proteins were recorded, whereby the proteins were now nano-electrosprayed from pseudo-physiological solutions,i.e. aqueous 50 mm ammonium acetate-buffered solutions, pH 6.8. We have shown previously (44Tahallah N. Pinkse M.W.H. Maier C.S. Heck A.J.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) that, using electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the detection of large noncovalent assemblies (exhibiting very high m/zvalues) could be significantly enhanced by optimizing the background pressures in the different regions of the mass spectrometer. In the case of the VAO assemblies studied here, raising the pressure is even indispensable to detect ions originating of the assemblies. In Fig. 3 a, the nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrum of wild-type VAO is shown, when sprayed from a 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer at pH 6.8, at a protein monomer concentration of 4 μm. As reported previously (42van Berkel W.J.H. van den Heuvel R.H.H. Versluis C. Heck A.J.R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), under these conditions, wild-type VAO is almost exclusively an octamer. From the crystal structure (inset, Fig. 3 a) it is well established that the VAO octamer can be described as a tetramer of dimers (18Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The exact mass of the large octamer assembly turned out to be more difficult to determine. The average mass was 508,700 ± 350 Da. In the mass spectra of the wild-type enzyme, only very small ion signals originating from dimeric species were observed (less than 4% of the total ion current). The nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrum of the apoVAO H61T mutant, sprayed under exactly the same experimental conditions and protein monomer concentration of 4 μm, is shown in Fig.3 b. In sharp contrast to the top spectrum this mass spectrum is dominated by ions that originate exclusively from the dimer. From the spectrum in Fig. 3 b the average mass of the dimer was determined to be 125,575 ± 26 Da. Other species could be detected, such as the tetramer and the octamer, but these ions contributed only less than 3% to the total ion current. The finding that apoVAO H61T prefers almost exclusively a dimeric structure seems to be in disagreement with previous crystallographic data, which revealed that the apoH61T variant was octameric. However, the experimental conditions whereby the protein crystals were grown are somewhat different from the current conditions (100 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.1, and an enzyme concentration of 12 mg/ml, which corresponds roughly to a protein monomer concentration of 200 μm) (27Fraaije M.W. van Den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2138987785,"Initiation of transcription of protein-encoding genes by RNA polymerase II was thought to require transcription factor TFIID, a complex comprising the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFs). In the presence of TBP-free TAF complex (TFTC), initiation of polymerase II transcription can occur in the absence of TFIID. TFTC contains several subunits that have been shown to play the role of transcriptional coactivators, including the GCN5 histone acetyltransferase (HAT), which acetylates histone H3 in a nucleosomal context. Here we analyze the coactivator function of TFTC. We show direct physical interactions between TFTC and the two distinct activation regions (H1 and H2) of the VP16 activation domain, whereas the HAT-containing coactivators, p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein), interact only with the H2 subdomain of VP16. Accordingly, cell transfection experiments demonstrate the requirement of both p300 and TFTC for maximal transcriptional activation by GAL-VP16. In agreement with this finding, we show that in vitro on a chromatinized template human TFTC mediates the transcriptional activity of the VP16 activation domain in concert with p300 and in an acetyl-CoA-dependent manner. Thus, our results suggest that these two HAT-containing co-activators, p300 and TFTC, have complementary rather than redundant roles during the transcriptional activation process."

A major C-O mode of hemea3 at 1958 cm−1 and two minor modes at 1967 and 1975 cm−1 (7:1:1) have been identified at room temperature and remained unchanged in H2O/D2O exchange. The observed C-O frequencies are 10 cm−1 higher than those obtained previously at 21 K (Einarsdoáttir, O., Killough, P. M., Fee, J. A., and Woodruff, W. H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2405–2408). The time-resolved FTIR data indicate that the transient Cu B1+–CO complex is formed at room temperature as revealed by the CO stretching mode at 2062 cm−1. Therefore, the caa3enzyme is the only documented member of the heme-copper superfamily whose binuclear center consists of an a3-type heme of a β-form and a CuB atom of an α-form. These results illustrate that the properties of the binuclear center in other oxidases resulting in the α-form are not required for enzymatic activity. Dissociation of the transient Cu B1+–CO complex is biphasic. The rate of decay is 2.3 × 104 s−1 (fast phase, 35%) and 36.3 s−1 (slow phase, 65%).

The former enzyme has received little attention, whereas the crystal structure of cytochrome ba3 was recently reported (2Soulimane T. Buse G. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Than M.E.

Both enzymes, in contrast to the eukaryotic cytochromecaa3(CcO),1 also catalyze the reduction of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide under anaerobic conditions (3Giuffre A. Stubauer G. Sart P. Brunori M.

These findings support the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin of bacterial denitrification and aerobic respiration. Cytochrome caa3 from T. thermophilus contains a mixed-valence [Cu A1.5+–Cu A1.5+] homodinuclear copper complex, two low-spin hemes (a- andc-type), and a binuclear center that consists of CuB and heme a3 (1Than M.E.

Heme c in cytochrome caa3 is covalently bound, providing an entity that has been found only in a few bacteria. Given thatcaa3 is a member of the heme-copper oxidases family, it is essential to learn its structure and function and thus understand its dual function in catalyzing the reduction of both O2 and NO. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the CO-bound heme-copper oxidases have revealed several characteristics of the binuclear pocket, including, from the frequencies of the C-O stretching modes of heme iron and CuB, the identity of the metal to which the CO is bound, as well as the interactions between the axial ligands and the heme and/or the CuB environment (5Woodruff W.H.

Recently, the comparison between the cryotrapped and room temperature intermediates of photodissociatedaa3 from mammalian andbo3 from Escherichia coli was reported, and the results were surprising (13Bailey J.A.

Although the frequencies of the major heme-CO and Cu B1+–CO bands are very similar between the cryogenic and the room temperature spectrum, features due to a change in absorbance of the C=O stretch of the carboxylic acid side chain of aspartic or glutamic acids are very different. The differences between the room temperature and cryogenic spectra have been attributed to the fact that in the cryogenic spectra, the final state has CO bound to CuB, whereas in the room temperature case (functional conditions) CO has dissociated from CuB. In a report on the “light” minus “dark” FTIR difference spectrum of cytochrome caa3 at 21 K, two C-O stretching modes were identified at 1953 cm−1 and 1947 cm−1 (6Einarsdoáttir O. Killough P.M. Fee J.A. Woodruff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2405-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, three minor modes at 1965 cm−1, 2036 cm−1, and 2060 cm−1, albeit with quite poor signal-to-noise, were reported. However, none of the modes were confirmed with isotope data. This work was carried out at 21 K and never addressed the origin of the anomalous low C-O stretching frequencies in caa3 as compared with other heme-copper oxidases.

It was also reported in a review article (5Woodruff W.H. J. Bioenerg.

However, no data exist in the literature. These rate constants are 35- and 20-fold smaller, respectively, than those measured for mammalianaa3 (k−1 = 7 × 105 s−1, k2 = 1030 s−1), and much larger than those reported for its counterpart ba3 (5Woodruff W.H.

We have also used time-resolved step-scan FTIR (TR-FTIR) to investigate the ligand dynamics subsequent to CO photolysis at room temperature, which is essential for elucidating the unique chemical mechanisms of the redox processes catalyzed by the enzyme. An understanding of the properties of thecaa3 binuclear center allows us to obtain further insight into the nature of the catalytic center in heme-copper oxidases, and it also serves as a benchmark for studies in which NO is added to the enzyme. Finally, it provides us with information as to whether the low temperature conformers of the CO adduct are populated at room temperature. Our results indicate that three C-O stretching modes associated with heme a3 at 1958, 1967, and 1975 cm−1 (7:1:1) are populated at room temperature. The observed C-O frequencies are 10 cm−1 higher than those obtained at 21 K (6Einarsdoáttir O. Killough P.M. Fee J.A. Woodruff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2405-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the observed C-O modes remained unchanged in H2O/D2O exchange. The major C-O mode is at 1958 cm−1, whereas that of the transient Cu B1+–CO complex is at 2062 cm−1, indicating that the β- and α-forms are the stable conformation of heme a 32+and Cu B1+, respectively. Consequently, the caa3 enzyme is the only reported member of the superfamily of heme-copper oxidases whose binuclear center consists of an a3-type heme of β-form and a CuB of an α-form. The implications of these results with respect to the enzymatic activity of heme-copper oxidases are discussed. By following the time dependence of the intensity of the isolated CO modes the rate of decay of the Cu B1+–CO complex and the observed rate of reformation of the heme a 32+–CO complex have been determined. To account for these observations we propose a model for the ligand dynamics in the heme a 32+/Cu B1+binuclear pocket. Fermentation of the T. thermophilus was performed at the Gesellschaft fu¨r Biotechnologische Forschung (Braunschweig, Germany). The purification of caa3 oxidase was according to Ref. 4Gerscher S Hildebreand P. Soulimane T. Buse G. Biospectroscopy. 1998; 4: 365-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Wild type CcO from P. denitrificans was purified according to Ref. 15Pinakoulaki E. Pfitzner U. Ludwig B. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13563-13568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, and mammalian CcO was isolated from beef hearts according to Ref. 16Varotsis C. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. The concentration of caa3 was determined from reduced-oxidized enzyme using an absorption coefficient ε605 = 11.7 mm−1cm−1. The pD solutions prepared in D2O buffers were measured by using a pH meter and assuming pD = pH(observed) + 0.4. Dithionite-reduced samples were exposed to 1 atm of CO (1 mm) in an anaerobic cell to prepare the carbonmonoxy adduct and loaded anaerobically into a cell with CaF2 windows and a 0.025-mm spacer. CO gas was obtained from Messer (Frankfurt, Germany) and isotopic CO (13CO) was purchased from Isotec. FTIR spectra were obtained from 400 to 500 μm samples with a Bruker Equinox 55 FTIR spectrometer equipped with liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector. The FTIR spectra were obtained as difference, using the buffer as background, and each spectrum is the average of 1000 scans. The spectral resolution used for the static FTIR measurements was 2 cm−1. The 532-nm pulse from a Continuum Nd-YAG laser (7-ns width, 3 Hz) was used as a pump light (10–15 mJ/pulse) to photolyze the caa3–CO complex. The time-resolved FTIR spectra were obtained with spectral resolution of 8 cm−1 and 5 μs time resolution for the 5 μs to 4 ms measurements or 100 μs for the 100 μs to 80 ms measurements. The total number of slices was 800, with 40 slices before and 760 after the laser firing. A total of ten co-additions per retardation data point were collected. Changes in intensity were recorded with an MCT detector, amplified (dc-coupled), and digitized with a 200-kHz, 16-bit, analog-to-digital converter. Blackman-Harris three-term apodization with 32 cm−1 phase resolution and the Mertz phase correction algorithm were used. Difference spectra were calculated as ΔA = −log(IS/IR). The rate constants for each phase of the decay of the Cu B1+–CO complex and for CO rebinding to heme a3 were calculated with three parameter exponential fit to the experimental data. Optical absorbance spectra were recorded before and after FTIR measurements to assess sample stability with a Perkin-Elmer Lamda 20 UV-visible spectrometer. The optical absorption spectrum of resting (as isolated)caa3 from T. thermophilus displays Soret maxima at 411 (heme c3+) and 424 nm (hemesa3+ and a 33+), and a visible band at 600 nm (Fig. 1, trace A). The dithionite-reduced enzyme displays Soret maxima at 416 (hemec2+) and 442 nm (hemesa2+ and a 32+) and visible maxima at 520, 548 (heme c2+), and 603 nm (a2+ and a 32+) (Fig. 1, trace B). The difference spectrum of the reduced CO-bound minus the reduced form is characteristic of CO binding to hemea3, as denoted by the peaks at 429 and 592 nm (Fig. 1, trace C). In Fig. 2 (traces A–C) we present the FTIR spectra of the CO-bound cytochromecaa3 complex at neutral pH and pD at room temperature. For comparison, we have included the analogous spectra of cytochrome aa3 from P. denitrificans(Fig. 2, trace D) and mammals (Fig. 2, trace E). The spectra of the CO-bound forms of the enzyme exhibit a major peak at 1958 cm−1 and two minor peaks at 1967 and 1975 cm−1, and their frequencies remained unchanged between H2O (trace C) and D2O (trace A). In the 13C16O derivative these peaks shift to 1913, 1922, and 1929 cm−1, respectively. Assignment of these modes is straightforward because the isotopic shifts follow well established patterns. The spectrum of theaa3 from P. denitrificans exhibits the major peak at 1966 cm−1 (α-form) and two minors at 1956 (β-form) and 1975 cm−1 (γ-form), whereas the spectrum of the mammalian enzyme exhibits a single ν(CO) at 1963 cm−1 (α-form). In caa3, the narrow width of the (CO) mode (FWHM = 5 cm−1) at 1958 cm−1 is an indication of the limited distribution of allowed CO conformations. The frequency of the major CO mode in cytochromecaa3 is 8 and 5 cm−1 lower than the corresponding frequencies found in CO-bound hemea3 from P. denitrificans and mammalian, respectively (8Park S. Pan L-P. Chan S.I. Alben J. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1036-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Rost B. Behr J. Hellwig P. Richter O.-M.H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Ma¨ntele W.

It is very similar, however, to that found in cbb3 oxidase whose binuclear center does not consist of o3- ora3-type heme (14Stavrakis S. Koutsoupakis K. Pinakoulaki E. Urbani A. Saraste M. Varotsis C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3814-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The insensitivity of the C-O modes associated with heme a3 to H/D exchange argues against the possibility of H-bonding between the bound CO and residues within the distal pocket. Several factors can influence the strength of the C-O bond. For instance, distal effects involving the interaction of CuB could alter the conformation of the Fe-C-O group from its preferred symmetry into a bent or tilt conformation, thereby raising the C-O frequency. Also, the strength of the proximal histidine H-bonding interaction affects the strength of both the Fe-C and C-O bonds that are further influenced by the CuB distal environment (15Pinakoulaki E. Pfitzner U. Ludwig B. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13563-13568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Varotsis C. Vamvouka M. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 7670-7673Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The Fe-His vibration of heme a3 in caa3 has a frequency at 211 cm−1 (4Gerscher S Hildebreand P. Soulimane T. Buse G. Biospectroscopy. 1998; 4: 365-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is close to those found in other aa3 type oxidases and to the high frequency Fe-His (193 and 208 cm−1) conformer ofba3 (18Oertling W.A. Surerus K.K. Einarsdoátirr O. Fee J.A. Dyer R.B. Woodruff W.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3128-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, from the present FTIR and previous resonance Raman (RR) data (4Gerscher S Hildebreand P. Soulimane T. Buse G. Biospectroscopy. 1998; 4: 365-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) it appears that the distal to the heme a3 environment has more direct control on the vibrational properties of the heme a 32+–CO complex. The α-, β-, and γ-conformational states have been attributed to changes in the distance between the iron atom of hemea3 and CuB (15Pinakoulaki E. Pfitzner U. Ludwig B. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13563-13568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Das T.K. Tomson F.K. Gennis R.B. Gordon M. Rousseau D.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2039-2045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The α-form represents a constricted pocket that will not allow CO to coordinate to the heme iron without strong distal polar or steric interactions between the CO and CuB, whereas in the β-form, CuB is moved away from the bound CO (21Wang J. Takahashi S. Hosler P.H. Mitchell D.M. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9819-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that in the γ-form, CuB is moved closer to the CO-bound heme a3, thereby the Fe-C-O moiety is further distorted from its preferred symmetry in the α-form (15Pinakoulaki E. Pfitzner U. Ludwig B. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13563-13568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consequently, we assign the major peak at 1958 cm−1 to the β-form and those at 1967 and 1975 cm−1 to the α and γ-forms, respectively. All the heme a-type cytochrome oxidases studied so far exhibit the α-form as the stable conformer at neutral pH and at room temperature (10Rost B. Behr J. Hellwig P. Richter O.-M.H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Ma¨ntele W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7565-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Varotsis C. Vamvouka M. J. Phys.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9819-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Accordingly, cytochrome caa3 is the only hemea-containing enzyme at the binuclear center in which the β-form is the stable conformation. Fig. 3 shows the step scan time-resolved FTIR difference spectra (td = 10 μs to 56 ms, 8 cm−1 spectral resolution) of fully reducedcaa3–CO subsequent to CO photolysis by a nanosecond laser pulse (532 nm). Upon photolysis, CO is transferred from heme a3 to CuB. The negative peaks at 1958 and 1975 cm−1 arise from the photolyzed heme a 32+–CO complex, and the positive peak that appears at 2062 cm−1 (td = 10 μs) is attributed to the C-O stretch (νCO) of the transient Cu B1+–CO complex, and its frequency, but not its intensity, is very similar to that obtained at 21 K (6Einarsdoáttir O. Killough P.M. Fee J.A. Woodruff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2405-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, the intensity of Cu B1+–CO at 21 K is within the signal-to-noise ratio. In the aa3-type oxidases, the frequencies of Cu B1+–CO at 2064 and 2042 cm−1 are associated with the α- and β-forms, respectively (10Rost B. Behr J. Hellwig P. Richter O.-M.H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Ma¨ntele W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7565-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Mitchell D.M. Shapleigh J.P. Archer A.M. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9446-9450Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the cbb3-type oxidase, where the binuclear center lacks the hydroxyethylfarnesyl side chain and the highly conserved among the heme-copper oxidases tyrosine 280 (P. denitrificans numbering), the corresponding frequency for the α-form is at 2065 cm−1 (14Stavrakis S. Koutsoupakis K. Pinakoulaki E. Urbani A. Saraste M. Varotsis C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3814-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Cu B1+–CO complex incaa3 is of the α-form, and the presence of the hydroxyethylgeranylgeranyl side chain has no effect on the vibrational properties of the bound CO to either the heme a3or CuB. At early times (10–100 μs), the decreasing intensity of the 2062 cm−1 mode indicates ligand dissociation from the transient Cu B1+–CO complex, whereas the intensity of the 1958/1975 cm−1 modes remains unchanged, suggesting that the initial decay of the Cu B1+–CO complex is not accompanied by the formation of the heme a 32+–CO complex. At later times, there is a lag phase (150 μs to 3 ms) in which no intensity changes are observed for either modes. Finally, at times longer than 4 ms there is a further decrease in intensity of the 2062 cm−1 mode with an accompanied intensity decrease of the 1958/1975 cm−1 modes. At 56 ms subsequent to CO photolysis the intensities of both the 1958/1975 and 2062 cm−1 modes are almost diminished. The high signal-to-noise ratio in the time-resolved FTIR spectra has allowed us to monitor the decay and appearance of the 2062 and 1958/1975 cm−1 modes. Fig.4panel A compares the decay of the Cu B1+–CO complex, as measured by ΔA of the 2062 cm−1 mode shown in Fig. 3, with the formation of the heme a 32+–CO complex (panel B) by measuring ΔA of the 1958/1975 cm−1 modes. The rate of decay of the transient Cu B1+–CO complex is 2.3 × 104 s−1 (fast phase, 35%) and 36.3 s−1 (slow phase, 65%), and the observed rate of rebinding to heme a3 is 34.1 s−1. Einarsdoáttir et al. (6Einarsdoáttir O. Killough P.M. Fee J.A. Woodruff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2405-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the major CO modes of the CO-bound caa3 at 1953 and 1947 cm−1 at 21 K. In our CO-bound fully reduced preparation, no peak at 1947 cm−1 is detected at room temperature. One possible explanation to account for the observed difference in the CO stretching frequencies is that different conformational states are populated at low and room temperatures. Temperature-dependent conformational states have been most intensively studied in the CO-bound form of theaa3 oxidases from bovine hearts and P. denitrficans (7Einarsdoáttir O. Dyer R.B. Lemon D.D.

Richter O.-M.H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Ma¨ntele W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7565-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the mammalian aa3oxidase it was found that only the frequency of the β-conformer shifts with temperature, starting at 1948 cm−1 at 21 K and shifting up to 1959 cm−1 at room temperature (7Einarsdoáttir O. Dyer R.B. Lemon D.D. Killough P.M. Hubig S.M. Atherton S.J. Lopez-Garriga J.J. Palmer G. Woodruff W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12013-12024Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Similarly, Rost et al. (10Rost B. Behr J. Hellwig P. Richter O.-M.H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Ma¨ntele W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7565-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) reported smaller upshifts (∼4 cm−1) with temperature for the β-form of theaa3 oxidase from P. denitrificans. Of note, the α-confomer in both the enzymes mentioned above is not temperature-dependent. It has also been argued that upon freezing aa3 from P. denitrificans, the ratio of the α-form to the β-form is changed in favor of the β-form (10Rost B. Behr J. Hellwig P. Richter O.-M.H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Ma¨ntele W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7565-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, because of the temperature-independence of the α-form it was suggested that the α-conformer is in a rigid environment, whereas the temperature-dependent β-conformer is in a more flexible environment. Incaa3 both the frequency and intensity of the CO modes are temperature-dependent, and thus we suggest that a conformational change is involved between the low and room temperature conformers that influences the relative population of the α- and β-forms. The molecular origin for the heme Fe-CuB binuclear center that is responsible for the unique Fe-C-O modes is intriguing. In a study with the CO complex of the cbb3-type oxidase from Rhodobacter capsulatus by Rousseau and co-workers (22Wang J. Gray K.A. Daldal F. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9363-9364Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) it was proposed that an open structure lacking the distal interactions present in the α-form, and thus allowing the hemeb3-bound CO to adopt a perpendicular conformation with respect to the heme, is the result of the stable β-form that is present in the binuclear center ofcbb3. Furthermore, it was suggested by the same authors that the α-form depends on the linkage between Y280 (P. denitrificans numbering) on the helix that coordinates CuB and the hydroxy group of the farnesyl side chain of heme a3 (23Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T.

The heme a3 in thecaa3 oxidase contains a hydroxygeranylgeranyl group and the conserved Y280, and thus the linkage between the tyrosine"

To determine its functional role, we generated a number of point mutations and divided them into three classes based on cellular localization. Class A mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and exerted an inhibitory effect on transport of vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein (VSVG) from the ER to Golgi as well as to the plasma membrane. Class B mutants exhibited a highly condensed Golgi complex and inhibited exit of anterograde cargo from this organelle. Class C mutants exhibited an intermediate phenotype with Golgi and ER localization along with extensive tubular structures emanating from the Golgi complex. There was a direct correlation between the cellular phenotype and binding to Rab and VAMP2. Class A and C mutants showed a significant decrease in Rab and VAMP2 binding, whereas an increase in binding was observed in the class B mutants. Thus, PRA1 is required for vesicle formation from the Golgi complex and might be involved in recruitment of Rab effectors and SNARE proteins during cargo sequestration.

They regulate vesicle trafficking by cycling through active membrane-bound GTP- and inactive cytosolic GDP-bound states. Membrane localization requires modification of the cysteine-containing motif at the carboxyl terminus by prenyl residues. Cycling between the membrane and cytosol is mediated by GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI),1 which extracts GDP-bound Rab from the membrane. Activation through guanine nucleotide exchange at the membrane is catalyzed by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, of which a number have been identified in mammals (1Horiuchi H. Lippe R.

Vesicular transport through the secretory pathway undergoes a number of discrete steps each involving budding, membrane remodeling, targeting, docking, and fusion. In ER to Golgi transport, anterograde cargo proteins such as VSVG are selectively transported to the Golgi along with resident ER proteins with the latter retrieved by a salvage process that recognizes distinct motifs within the protein (3Jackson M.R.

Virol. 2002; 76: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of these interactions remains unclear. To determine the physiological function of PRA1, we generated a number of point mutations and examined their effect on cellular localization, organelle morphology, protein trafficking, and binding to Rab and VAMP2. PRA1 mutations were generated by the PCR amplification using pQE11/HA-tagged PRA1 as template (13Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For bacterial expression, the PCR products were inserted between theApaI and SpeI sites of a modified pQE10* vector (Qiagen). For the mammalian expression of the PRA1 mutants, the constructs were subcloned into the pIRESpuro vector (CLONTECH) between the ClaI andEcoRI sites. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium α (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transient expression, 6 × 104 CHO cells were seeded overnight on 12-mm coverslips. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and fixed 36–48 h after transfection with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h followed by incubation in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum, and 0.4% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 15 min. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and rabbit anti-Man II (a generous gift from Dr. M. Farquhar) antibodies were used as primary antibodies, and after washing washed with 100 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline, Alexa 488 or 595-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used. Coverslips were mounted with SlowFade Light antifade (Molecular Probes). For sensitivity to BFA, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml BFA for 30 min before fixing. For stable transfection, CHO were transfected with pIRESpuro/HA-PRA1 constructs and clonal lines selected for puromycin resistance at 10 μg/ml. Several clonal lines were isolated, and positive clones were identified by immunocytochemistry. To examine VSVG-GFP trafficking time course, CHO and PRA1 stable cell lines were seeded overnight on 12-mm coverslips, transfected with pCDM8.1/VSVGts045-GFP (19Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and 18 h after transfection shifted to 42 °C for 5 h. Cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) was added 10 min before shifting back to 37 °C, and cells were then fixed after 0, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min. Cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy and were scored by phenotype (ER, Golgi-trans-Golgi network, and plasma membrane) with a minimum of 100 cells scored per coverslip. The values presented were from three independent experiments and verified on at least two clonal lines. For surface labeling, cells were chased for 0, 60, and 120 min and fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were processed for immunocytochemistry as described above except in the absence of saponin, and all steps were performed at 4 °C. The monoclonal antibody BW8G65 directed against the extracellular domain of VSVG (a generous gift from Dr. M. Farquhar) was used to label cell surface-exposed VSVG followed by Alexa 594-labeled secondary antibodies. The PRA1 mutants were subcloned into the modified pGAD424X prey vector (13Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) at the EcoRI andXhoI sites. They were then co-transformed as described (20Gietz D., St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar) with Rab3A or VAMP2 bait plasmids (13Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and grown on Trp and Leu drop-out plates for 3–5 days. The cells were patched onto filter paper, lysed by brief liquid nitrogen treatment, and incubated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (21Bartel P. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity as well as the time of onset was used to assess the strength of the interactions. To verify the yeast two-hybrid results, in vitro binding studies were performed with recombinant His6-tagged Rab3A as described previously (14Hutt D.M., Da- Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). GST-tagged VAMP2 (from Dr. W. S. Trimble) and His6-HA-tagged PRA1 wild type and mutants were purified as described previously (13Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), except that the PRA1 used in the PRA1/Rab3A binding assay was eluted with 50 mm EDTA. All recombinant proteins were quantified by densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. His6-tagged, purified PRA1s were covalently cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). A typical PRA1-Rab3A binding assay contained 10.8 pmol of His6-HA-PRA1 cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and 320 nm His6-Rab3A in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.25 mm GDPβS, 10% glycerol, and 0.005% Triton X-100 in a total volume of 250 μl, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with ice-cold binding buffer. Denaturing loading buffer was added to the beads, and proteins purified with the beads were subjected to Western immunoblot analysis using anti-Rab3A antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). The assays were done in triplicate, and the signals were quantified using the Typhoon 8600 imager (Amersham Biosciences) and averaged for comparative analysis. Glutathione-agarose beads were used to pulldown GST-VAMP2 as described previously (13Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A typical PRA1-VAMP2 binding assay contained 40 nm GST-VAMP2 or GST control and 30 nm His6-HA-PRA1s in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.005% Triton X-100 in a total volume of 250 μl and was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-agarose was used to recover the GST-VAMP2, and PRA1 was detected using anti-HA antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The signals obtained were quantified as described above. To determine the function of PRA1, we employed a mutagenic approach by introducing point mutations to the two most highly conserved regions: one proximal to the first hydrophobic domain (residues 40–104) and a second spanning residues 134–171. The resulting amino-terminal HA-tagged PRA1 mutants were transfected into CHO and classified based on cellular localization (Table I). The wild type PRA1 is primarily localized to the Golgi complex (Fig.1 A) but retained in the ER in the truncated PRA1-(1–164) (Fig. 1 B) (14Hutt D.M., Da- Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The class A mutants displayed an ER phenotype similar to PRA1-(1–164), suggesting that the protein was either retained in or retrogradely transported to the ER (Fig. 1 C). The class B mutants were characterized by a highly condensed Golgi complex, which is suggestive of a defect in transport through this compartment (Fig. 1, Dand E). Finally, in class C, PRA1 showed both Golgi and ER localization but with extensive tubular structures emanating from the Golgi complex (Fig. 1 F). Two other PRA1 mutations, N77A and W154A, showed little or no significant change in their Golgi localization compared with the wild type. Thus, mutations targeted to the two conserved regions of PRA1 can alter the cellular localization of the protein as well as Golgi morphology.Table IClassification of PRA1 mutants according to cellular localizationPRA1ClassCellular localizationWTGolgiN77AGolgiW154AGolgiN70TAERY78AAERS76ABCondensed GolgiS76VBCondensed GolgiV161ABCondensed GolgiY73ACGolgi, ER, and tubular structuresH166ACGolgi, ER, and tubular structuresThe HA-tagged constructs were transfected into CHO cells and stained with anti-HA antibodies. Open table in a new tab The HA-tagged constructs were transfected into CHO cells and stained with anti-HA antibodies. To determine whether mislocalization of PRA1 has any effect on Golgi morphology, we examined the localization of the prototypical Golgi resident enzyme Man II. As shown in Fig. 2, Man II appeared as a well defined perinuclear crescent structure in CHO transfected with the wild type PRA1. However, in both class A (N70T) and C (H166A) mutants, Man II labeling appeared more dispersed at the perinuclear region with extensive punctate vesicular staining throughout the cell body. Because Man II recycles via COPI-containing vesicles from thetrans-Golgi (6Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Prekeris R. Oorschot V.M. Scheller R. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Klumperman J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the dispersed Golgi appearance in class A and C mutants is suggestive of impairment in recycling of these Man II-containing vesicles. In the class B (S76A) mutants, Man II tightly co-localized with the mutant PRA1 in the highly condensed Golgi complex (Fig. 2). This highly condensed Golgi complex remained sensitive to disruption by BFA (Fig. 3), which was also observed in the wild type and in all mutants (data not shown).Figure 3Disruption of the Golgi complex by BFA. Cellular localization of PRA1 was identified with anti-HA and the Golgi complex with anti-Man II in cells transfected with the wild type and S76A mutant PRA1. The cells were treated with 10 μg/ml of BFA for 30 min before fixing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the altered Golgi morphology is due to impairment in Golgi transport, we examined the transport of the anterograde-directed VSVGts045 tagged with GFP (19Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) through the secretory pathway. We took a representative from each class of mutants and established stable clonal lines. The cells were transfected with VSVGts045-GFP and shifted to the non-permissive temperature of 42 °C for 5 h to trap the GFP-tagged protein at the ER. This prolonged incubation also allowed complete clearance of preexisting VSVGts045-GFP from the plasma membrane and other intracellular compartments. Protein synthesis was then blocked with cycloheximide, and the cells were returned to the permissive temperature. The cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde at various times, after release from the non-permissive temperature, and scored for the presence of VSVGts045-GFP in the various intracellular compartments. In CHO cells, VSVGts045-GFP was evident in dispersed perinuclear structures 15 min after release (Fig.4). At 30 min, VSVGts045-GFP has reached the Golgi complex with significant accumulation at the plasma membrane at 60 min release. Almost all of the cells exhibited VSVGts045-GFP at the plasma membrane after 90 min. Cells overexpressing the wild type PRA1 showed a slight delay in transport of VSVGts045-GFP to the Golgi complex such that a significant amount of the protein remained in the ER or in dispersed intermediate compartment at 30 min release. However, the bulk of the protein was transported to the Golgi complex at 60 min and eventually reached the plasma membrane after 90 min. In contrast there was a significant delay in transport of VSVGts045-GFP out of the ER in both the class A mutant N70T and C mutant H166A after 15 min release. The protein finally cleared the ER compartment after 30 min with some reaching the plasma membrane at 90 min in the class A mutant N70T. Finally, VSVGts045-GFP was transported rapidly from the ER to Golgi in the class B mutant S76A after 15 min release. However, the protein remained at the Golgi complex with little or no transport to the plasma membrane after 90 min. We quantified the percentage of cells exhibiting the VSVGts045-GFP signal at the different intracellular compartments after release from the non-permissive temperature. In untransfected CHO, only 10% of the cells retained a detectable VSVGts045-GFP signal in the ER 15 min after release (Fig.5 A). VSVGts045-GFP rapidly exited the Golgi complex (Fig. 5 B) and reached the plasma membrane at 90 min release (Fig. 5 C). In cells transfected with the wild type PRA1, a significant percentage of the cells showed VSVGts045-GFP retention in the ER at 15 min release (Fig. 5 A) and in the Golgi at 60–90 min (Fig.5 B). This resulted in a decrease in the number of cells with detectable VSVGts045-GFP at the plasma membrane at 90 min (Fig. 5 C). An even larger fraction of the cells showed ER accumulation of VSVGts045-GFP at 15 min release in the class A mutant N70T. There was also decreased localization of VSVGts045-GFP in the plasma membrane at 90 min. Retention of VSVGts045-GFP in the ER at 15 min release was less severe in the class B mutant S76A (Fig. 5 A), but the protein failed to exit the Golgi complex (Fig. 5 B) resulting in very low plasma membrane localization at 90 min release (Fig.5 C). This was also seen in the class C mutant H166A except that this mutant also exhibited extensive accumulation in the ER at 15 min release (Fig. 5 A). Thus, overexpression of wild type PRA1 has a mild inhibitory effect on transport of the anterograde cargo VSVGts045-GFP to its final destination at the plasma membrane. Transport out of the ER was significantly affected in the class A mutant N70T, although final localization to the plasma membrane was also affected. This also appeared to be the case for the class C mutant H166A. Finally, exit from the Golgi complex was the major defect in the class B mutant S76A. To verify that transport of VSVGts045-GFP to the plasma membrane was indeed delayed, we labeled cell surface-exposed VSVG with BW8G65, a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain, under non-permeabilized conditions. In all cases, VSVG was undetectable at the cell surface after 5 h of incubation at the non-permissive temperature, thus verifying that the luminal domain was indeed inaccessible to the antibody under our non-permeabilizing conditions (Fig. 6). VSVG was detectable in CHO as discrete patches on the cell surface at 60 min release, and the entire surface was labeled at 120 min release (Fig. 6). Patches of VSVG were detected on the plasma membrane in cells overexpressing wild type PRA1 at 60 and 90 min release. However, the overall intensities were significantly lower than the untransfected CHO at the corresponding time points. Even less VSVG reached the cell surface in cells transfected with mutant PRA1s at both 60 and 120 min release with S76A being the worst (Fig. 6). The green fluorescence signal was quite strong in all mutants indicating extensive intracellular accumulation of VSVGts045-GFP. Taken together, the data indicate that overexpression of wild type PRA1 delayed the transport of VSVGts045-GFP to the cell surface. This effect was exacerbated by the mutant PRA1s with S76A showing the highest level of inhibition. We next examined the binding properties of the mutant PRA1s to determine whether this might be an underlying cause of the altered Golgi morphology and inhibition in transport of VSVGts045-GFP. We and others (13Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Figueroa C. Taylor J. Vojtek A.B. J.

Commun. 1999; 258: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have shown previously that PRA1 binds to Rab GTPases and VAMP2. We first screened the binding properties of the mutant PRA1 in the yeast two-hybrid system by subcloning representatives from each into the prey vector. The resulting vectors were co-transformed into the Y190 tester strain with either Rab3A as a representative Rab GTPase or VAMP2 bait, and the transformants were scored for β-galactosidase activity. All class A mutants showed extremely weak or no interaction with either Rab3A or VAMP2, whereas the class B mutants showed increased interaction with both Rab3A and VAMP2 (Table II). The class C mutant H166A showed a weak interaction with VAMP2 but lost its interaction with Rab3A. Thus, the data suggest that interaction of the mutant PRA1 with Rab and VAMP2 may underlie mislocalization of the protein, the altered Golgi morphology, and defect in VSVGts045-GFP transport.Table IIYeast two-hybrid screen of PRA1 mutants against Rab3A or VAMP2PRA1 preyRab3A baitVAMP2 baitWT++++PRA1-(1–164)−−N70T−−Y78A−−S76A++++++V161A++++++H166A−+The bait and prey plasmids were co-transformed into Y190 tester strain and selected on Trp, Leu drop-out plates.

Open table in a new tab The bait and prey plasmids were co-transformed into Y190 tester strain and selected on Trp, Leu drop-out plates. The transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity on X-gal filter paper and intensity as well as the time of onset used to assess the strength of the interactions. We verified the binding properties of the mutant PRA1s by in vitro pulldown assays using purified recombinant His6-HA-tagged PRA1s, GST-VAMP2, and His6-tagged Rab3A, with Rab3A expressed in yeast to ensure prenyl modification that is essential for PRA1 binding. Because both PRA1 and Rab3A were His6-tagged, purified PRA1s were covalently attached to CNBr-Sepharose beads. We first determined the saturating amount of wild type PRA1 needed to pulldown GDP-bound Rab3A. We then used the EC50 value to determine the amount of Rab3A recovered with the mutant PRA1s by Western immunoblot (Fig.7 A), and we normalized this to the wild type PRA1 (Fig. 7 B). In all cases, we detected two immunoreactive Rab3A (Fig. 7 A), which probably represents mono- and di-geranylgeranylated species. A similar approach was used to determine VAMP2 binding using glutathione-agarose beads. The class A mutant N70T showed only residual binding to Rab3A and VAMP2 when compared with wild type PRA1 (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, there was a 3-fold increase in Rab3A and a 6-fold increase in VAMP2 binding in the class B mutant S76A. A significant reduction in Rab3A and VAMP2 binding was observed in the class C mutant H166A. Thus, there was a direct correlation between cellular phenotype and ability of PRA1 to bind Rab and VAMP2. Loss of Rab and VAMP2 binding in the class A mutants correlated with retention of the mutant PRA1 in the ER, whereas enhanced binding to both in the class B mutants correlated with a highly condensed Golgi. A decrease in both Rab and VAMP2 binding in the class C mutants correlated with an intermediate phenotype. PRA1 is a protein that is localized primarily to the Golgi complex (14Hutt D.M., Da- Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and post-Golgi compartments (15Fenster S.D. Chung W.J. Zhai R. Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Kaempf U. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Neuron. 2000; 25: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We have shown here that point mutations of PRA1 can alter its cellular localization as well as vesicle trafficking. The class A mutants displayed an ER phenotype along with a significant decrease in binding to both Rab3A and VAMP2. A number of factors are known to affect protein transport from the ER to Golgi complex. Efficient exit of PRA1 from the ER has been shown to be dependent on the DXEE motif at the carboxyl terminus (23Abdul-Ghani M. Gougeon P.Y. Prosser D.C., Da- Silva L.F. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6225-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because this motif remained intact in the class A mutants, it is unlikely that a defect in the DXEE-mediated mechanism is the underlying cause of ER retention. Protein folding or oligomerization is another factor. Although it is possible that all class A point mutations might bring about complete denaturation of the protein, we believe that it is more plausible that functional interaction of PRA1 with Rab is required for anterograde transport. A number of studies have shown involvement of Rab GTPases in vesicle formation at various stages of the secretory and endocytic pathways (24Riederer M.A. Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Lin J. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 25Wilson B.S. Nuoffer C. Meinkoth J.L. McCaffery M. Feramisco J.R. Balch W.E. Farquhar M.G. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13167-13170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Such loss of Rab binding would affect either membrane recruitment of Rab or Rab effectors leading to inhibition of transport. This would be consistent with both accumulation of recycling Man II-containing vesicles and delay in ER to Golgi transport of the anterograde cargo VSVG in these cells. Thus, the significant decrease in binding to Rab and VAMP2 implies that functional interaction of PRA1 with these proteins is tightly linked to vesicular transport. It remains to be seen whether the effect on ER to Golgi transport is solely due to PRA1 or interference of PRA2, which is the isoform localized exclusively to the ER compartment (23Abdul-Ghani M. Gougeon P.Y. Prosser D.C., Da- Silva L.F. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6225-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The condensed Golgi morphology in the class B mutant S76A indicates that PRA1 is also involved in trafficking through this compartment. The mutation significantly inhibited transit of the anterograde cargo VSVGts045-GFP through the Golgi and its subsequent incorporation into the plasma membrane. Because PRA1 is known to interact with multiple Rab GTPases (13Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol.

Doring F. Robinson D.G. Yang X. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6460-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), are affected. We surmise that the increased binding of Rab and VAMP2 by the class B mutant S76A might affect either recycling or functional interaction with Rab effector molecules that ultimately lead to decreased transport out of the Golgi apparatus. Our data suggest a direct involvement of PRA1 in anterograde transport to and out of the Golgi complex. Aside from its interaction with Rab GTPases (13Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 242-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that it might recruit Rab GTPases and their effectors to membrane domains along with functional SNAREs to ensure proper sequestration in the budding vesicle. ER to Golgi transport was affected in the class A mutants possibly due to incorporation of the mutant protein to the ER, which interferes with proper functioning through oligomerization with endogenous protein. Defect at later transport steps might arise from reduced exit of endogenous PRA1 and other components of the secretory machinery from the ER. This is likely to be the same underlying mechanism in the class C mutants although at lower severity. In the class B mutants, the increased binding to Rab GTPases may either interfere with functional interaction with their effectors or their retrieval from membranes. Exit of proteins such as VAMP2 might also be inhibited thereby affecting the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. The localization of the mutant PRA1 to the Golgi complex is consistent with its effect on exit of anterograde cargo from this compartment. The condensed Golgi appearance is similar to that observed in cells expressing dominant negative dynamin 2, which blocks vesicle formation from the trans-Golgi network (33Cao H. Thompson H.M. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1993-2002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that PRA1 is required for vesicle formation from the Golgi complex and that PRA1 might influence the recruitment of Rab effectors during cargo sequestration as well as proteins required for subsequent vesicle docking and fusion. This may serve to ensure that a budding vesicle has all the necessary proteins for subsequent docking and fusion. We thank Dr. M. G. Farquhar for the generous gift of Man II and BW8G65 antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1971380201,"The N-terminal zinc finger (ZnF) from GATA transcription factors mediates interactions with FOG family proteins. In FOG proteins, the interacting domains are also ZnFs; these domains are related to classical CCHH fingers but have an His → Cys substitution at the final zinc-ligating position. Here we demonstrate that different CCHC fingers in the FOG family protein U-shaped contact the N-terminal ZnF of GATA-1 in the same fashion although with different affinities. We also show that these interactions are of moderate affinity, which is interesting given the presumed low concentrations of these proteins in the nucleus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the variant CCHC topology enhances binding affinity, although the His → Cys change is not essential for the formation of a stably folded domain. To ascertain the structural basis for the contribution of the CCHC arrangement, we have determined the structure of a CCHH mutant of finger nine from U-shaped. The structure is very similar overall to the wild-type domain, with subtle differences at the C terminus that result in loss of the interaction in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that the CCHC zinc binding topology is required for the integrity of GATA-FOG interactions and that weak interactions can play important roles in vivo.

Zinc binding domains (often referred to as zinc fingers, or ZnFs) 1The abbreviations used are: ZnF, zinc finger; USH-F1, finger 1 from U-shaped; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; Pnr-NF, N-terminal ZnF of Pannier; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid: NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; FOG, friend of GATA-1; d4-TSP, sodium 3-trimethylsilyl[2,2,3,3-2H]propionate; CREB, cAMP-response element. 1The abbreviations used are: ZnF, zinc finger; USH-F1, finger 1 from U-shaped; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; Pnr-NF, N-terminal ZnF of Pannier; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid: NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; FOG, friend of GATA-1; d4-TSP, sodium 3-trimethylsilyl[2,2,3,3-2H]propionate; CREB, cAMP-response element. are extremely common in eukaryotes; for example, perhaps 3–4% of human genes encode proteins that contain such domains. At least 20 different classes of zinc binding domains have been identified, differing in the number of zinc ions they bind and the identity and spacing of the ligating amino acids. Since the initial discovery of the classical zinc fingers in TFIIIA (1Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar), it has become clear that many zinc binding domains function as sequence-specific DNA (or RNA) binding motifs. However, it has also become apparent that many classes of zinc binding domains, including LIM domains and PHD domains, have roles as mediators of protein-protein interactions. GATA and classical ZnFs have also been shown to be capable of contacting other proteins, especially in the context of the regulation of gene expression (for review, see Ref. 2Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated, both in Drosophila melanogasterand in mammals, that interactions between ZnFs of GATA and FOG family transcription factors are essential for normal development. In mammals, GATA-1 and FOG-1 cooperate to drive erythroid development (3Tsang A.P. Fujiwara Y. Hom D.B. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), whereas the Drosophila proteins Pannier (a GATA family protein; Ref.4Ramain P. Heitzler P. Haenlin M. Simpson P.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3083-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). GATA proteins (Fig. 1 A; Ref.8Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar) typically contain two ZnFs with a CX 2CX 17CX 2C consensus. The more C-terminal of these two domains (CF) binds DNA sequences containing GATA sites, whereas the N-terminal zinc finger (NF) may contact promoters with different motifs (9Newton A. Mackay J. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, the zinc finger domains have been shown to mediate interactions with other proteins, including CREB-binding protein (10Blobel G.A. Nakajima T. Eckner R. Montminy M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), erythroid Kruppel-like factor (11Merika M. Orkin S. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). FOG family proteins (Fig. 1 B) contain either eight or nine ZnFs that are related to the classical CCHH ZnFs (which have a conserved C-X 2–5CX12HX 2–5H sequence). Several of the fingers in each FOG protein, however, have an altered consensus sequence in which the final zinc binding histidine is replaced with a cysteine. Interestingly, it is only these variant CCHC ZnFs that mediate interactions with GATA NFs. The structures of two of these domains (fingers 1 and 9 from D. melanogaster U-shaped) have recently been determined (16Liew C.K. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Newton A. Sharpe B.K. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 1157-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and were found to resemble classical CCHH fingers in structure. The only notable difference is a short extended portion of the polypeptide backbone before the fourth zinc ligand (Fig.1 C). The GATA binding surface of one CCHC finger (finger 1 from U-shaped; USH-F1) has been determined (16Liew C.K. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Newton A. Sharpe B.K. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 1157-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Fox A.H. Liew C. Holmes M. Kowalski K. Mackay J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2812-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Two of the residues implicated in GATA binding are located on the extended portion of the backbone, immediately preceding the final cysteine, and mutation of the cysteine to histidine (changing the finger to a classical CCHH ZnF) is sufficient to abolish the GATA-FOG interaction in vivo (18Matthews J.M. Kowalski K. Liew C.K. Sharpe B.K. Fox A.H. Crossley M. MacKay J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The CCHC topology therefore appears to play a key role in facilitating the interaction, but the molecular explanation for this is currently unknown. The residues that are implicated in GATA binding are largely conserved across FOG family CCHC ZnFs (Fig. 1 D), although three of the residues that affect the binding affinity show some variation. This variation gives rise to strong and weak interactors, as assigned using a yeast two-hybrid assay (17Fox A.H. Liew C. Holmes M. Kowalski K. Mackay J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2812-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, whether such affinity differences are real or result from the indirect and qualitative nature of the assay. The interactions between the GATA and FOG proteins have become a topic of considerable interest because natural mutations that interfere with the interactions are associated with human genetic disorders. TheGATA-1 gene is on the X chromosome, and males carrying defective GATA-1 alleles exhibit various hematological abnormalities, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and β-thalassemia trait. Five different mutations in the GATA-1 N-finger have now been described (19Freson K. Devriendt K. Matthijs G. Van Hoof A., De Vos R. Thys C. Minner K. Hoylaerts M.F. Vermylen J. Van Geet C. Blood. 2001; 98: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Freson K. Matthijs G. Thys C. Marien P. Hoylaerts M.F. Vermylen J. Van Geet C. Hum. Mol.

Blood. 2001; 98: 2681-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Nichols K.E. Crispino J.D. Poncz M. White J.G. Orkin S.H. Maris J.M. Weiss M.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Four of these interfere with the interaction between the GATA-1 N-finger and FOG. Of these, two mutations (V205M, G208S) map to residues that directly mediate GATA-FOG contacts, whereas two others (D218G, D218Y) map to a region close to the FOG binding surface. The fifth mutation (R216Q) interferes with the DNA binding activity of the GATA-NF but does not affect the interaction with FOG. The four mutations that do impair the interaction with FOG do so to different extents, and all five mutations cause different genetic disorders. For instance, V205M disrupts the binding of the GATA-1 NF to FOG fingers 1, 6, and 9 and causes a severe anemia and thrombocytopenia (22Nichols K.E. Crispino J.D. Poncz M. White J.G. Orkin S.H. Maris J.M. Weiss M.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). G208S (21Mehaffey M.G. Newton A.L. Gandhi M.J. Crossley M. Drachman J.G. Blood. 2001; 98: 2681-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and D218G (19Freson K. Devriendt K. Matthijs G. Van Hoof A., De Vos R. Thys C. Minner K. Hoylaerts M.F. Vermylen J. Van Geet C. Blood. 2001; 98: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), on the other hand, significantly disrupt the interaction with FOG finger 9 but have little effect on the complex formed with FOG fingers 1 and 6; these mutations cause thrombocytopenia without significant anemia. The D218Y mutation (20Freson K. Matthijs G. Thys C. Marien P. Hoylaerts M.F. Vermylen J. Van Geet C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 147-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also affects the interaction with FOG, although this effect has not yet been correlated with the binding of specific FOG fingers. It is likely that an understanding of the molecular details of how different FOG fingers contact GATA-1 may help explain these different phenotypes. Here we characterize the interaction between U-shaped finger 9 (USH-F9; assigned as a “weak” interactor) and the N-terminal ZnF of Pannier (Pnr-NF). The residues involved in the interaction are identified using a 1H,15N HSQC titration and compare closely with those defined for the complex formed between U-shaped finger 1 (USH-F1; a “strong” interactor) and murine GATA-1 NF. These results suggest a common mechanism of interaction among weakly and strongly interacting FOG fingers. We also use isothermal titration calorimetry to directly measure the association constants for a number of GATA·FOG complexes. All of these association constants are relatively weak (∼104–105m−1), and the USH-F9·Pnr-NF complex is found to be weaker than the USH-F1·Pnr-NF complex. Finally, the importance of the CCHC topology in FOG zinc fingers is investigated. The introduction of a C1142H mutation in USH-F9 weakens but does not abolish its interaction with Pannier. Determination of the structure of this CCHH-type mutant finger reveals the basis for this difference, a subtle change in the conformation at the C-terminal end of the α-helix. USH-F1, USH-F9, and murine GATA-1 NF were expressed and purified as previously described (16Liew C.K. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Newton A. Sharpe B.K. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 1157-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Kowalski K. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Pannier NF (Pannier (165–208)) was subcloned, overexpressed, and purified using the same protocol as that used for the GATA-1 NF, except that the template for PCR of the construct was obtained from a D. melanogaster cDNA library. The C1142H mutant of U-shaped finger 9 (C32H), encoding residues 1113–1146 of U-shaped, was produced by single-primer mismatch PCR using a 3′ primer encoding the Cys → His substitution. The amplified oligonucleotide was inserted into the Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The peptide (with residues numbered 1–36, including Gly-1 and Ser-2, which are the product of the thrombin recognition sequence) was overexpressed and purified by glutathione-affinity chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography as previously described (23Kowalski K. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The purification yielded ∼2 mg of >95% pure peptide per liter of culture. The identity of the peptide was confirmed using electrospray mass spectrometry (Mtheor. = 4201.8 Da; Mobs. = 4202.0 Da). Overexpression of 15N-labeled C32H was performed using a bacterial fermenter as previously described (16Liew C.K. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Newton A. Sharpe B.K. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 1157-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Samples for HSQC titrations or structure determination were prepared by dissolving 0.4 mg of15N-labeled USH-F9, 2.6 mg of Pnr-NF, or 2.1 mg of C32H in H2O/D2O (95:5; 500 μl) containing 1.5 molar eq of both tris(2-carboxyethylphosphine)·HCl and ZnSO4; this gave sample concentrations of 200 μm and 1 mm for USH-F9 and Pnr-NF/C32H, respectively. The pH was adjusted to 5.0 using 0.1 and 0.01m NaOH. NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple-resonance gradient probe. Spectra were acquired at 293 K using spectral widths of 12 ppm for 1H and 30 ppm for 15N. The following homonuclear two-dimensional spectra were recorded on the unlabeled sample: total correlation spectroscopy (24Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) with MLEV mixing (T m = 70 ms), NOE spectroscopy (T m = 50 and 250 ms; Ref. 25Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 9: 1-6Crossref Scopus (2007) Google Scholar), double quantum-filtered COSY (26Piantini U. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1880) Google Scholar), and E.COSY (27Griesinger C. Soerensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 6394-6396Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Using the15N-labeled sample, HSQC (28Bax A. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Tschudin R. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 86: 304-318Google Scholar, 29Norwood T.J. Boyd J. Heritage J.E. Soffe N. Campbell I.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 488-501Google Scholar) and three-dimensional HNHA (30Vuister G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) experiments were recorded. For the detection of two- and three-bond scalar couplings involving the histidine side chain nitrogens, an HSQC was recorded in which the dephasing delay 1/4J was set to 11 ms (31Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadon N.D. Roseman S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and the carrier frequency and spectral width were set to 200 ppm and 6000 Hz, respectively. Solvent suppression was achieved using either pulsed-field gradients or presaturation (double quantum-filtered-COSY and E.COSY). NMR data were processed as previously described (23Kowalski K. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and analyzed using XEASY (32Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter P. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). The 1H frequency scale of all spectra was directly referenced to sodium 3-trimethylsilyl[2,2,3,3-2H]propionate (d4-TSP) at 0.00 ppm, whereas the 15N frequency scale was indirectly referenced to liquid NH3 via the 1H frequency of the d 4-TSP resonance (33Live D.H. Davis D.G. Agosta W.C. Cowburn D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 1939-1941Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared as described above. [15N]C32H and [15N]USH-F9 were prepared at concentrations of 200 μm, and unlabeled Pnr-NF was prepared at a concentration of 1 mm.15N-Labeled USH-F9 was titrated with unlabeled Pnr-NF, and1H,15N HSQC spectra were acquired at Pnr-NF:USH-F9 molar ratios of 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0. The same titration was performed using 15N-labeled C32H and unlabeled Pnr-NF. The binding of USH-F9 (U) and Pnr-NF (P) to form a complex (UP) can be expressed as [U] + [P] ⇌ [UP], where the association constant, K a, is given by Ka=[UP][U][P]Equation 1 If U0 and P0 are the total concentrations of USH-F9 and Pnr-NF, respectively, at a given point in the titration, then K a and [UP] can be expressed as Ka=[UP](U0−[UP])(P0−[UP])Equation 2 [UP]=12x−x−4U0P0Equation 3 where x = (U0 + P0 + 1/K a). If the product of the lifetime of the complex (τUP) and the difference in chemical shift between the free and bound states (δUP − δU) is much less than one (i.e. τUP.Δδ ≪ 1), then the system is considered to be in fast exchange. Under these conditions, a single resonance is observed at the population-weighted average chemical shift (δobs) of the nuclei in the free and bound states, δobs=δUfU+δUPfUPEquation 4 where δU is the chemical shift of a nucleus in free USH-F9, δUP is the chemical shift of the same nucleus in the USH-F9·Pnr-NF complex, and f Uand f UP are the mole fractions of the free and bound species, respectively (given by f U = [U]/U0 = 1 − f UP). Rearranging gives δobs=δU+(δUPδU)·[UP]/U0Equation 5 If (3Tsang A.P. Fujiwara Y. Hom D.B. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) is substituted into (5Haenlin M. Cubadda Y. Blondeau F. Heitzler P. Lutz Y. Simpson P. Ramain P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3096-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the resulting expression can be used to fit a plot of δobs against P0 using nonlinear least-squares methods. Data from the titration of USH-F9 with Pan-NF were fitted using the nonlinear least squares package provided in Origin (Microcal, MA); the values of K a and (δUP − δU) were allowed to vary during the fit. For resonances in the intermediate exchange region, 2π‖νU−νUP‖≈1τU+1τUPEquation 6 where τU is the lifetime of free USH-F9 and νU − νUP is the magnitude of the frequency difference between the free and bound states. The peak position for a resonance in intermediate exchange does not accurately reflect the weighted average between the free and bound states of the protein and can no longer be determined by a simple expression such as Equation 5. However, the amplitude of a signal from USH-F9 as a function of frequency for a particular Pnr-NF concentration can be determined from the imaginary component of the complex quantityG(ν) (34Feeney J. Batchelor J.G. Albrand J.P. Roberts G.C.K. J. Magn. Reson. 1979; 33: 519-529Google Scholar), which is given by G(ν)=−iC2fUfUPτ−τ2fUfUPfUαUP+fUPαUτ2αUαUPEquation 7 where τ =f U/k off,k off is the off-rate for the complex, andC is a scaling factor (which scales the intensity of the signal but has no bearing on its line-shape or position). The quantities αU and αUP are given by αU=−2π.i(νU−ν)+1T2U+fUPτEquation 8 and αUP=−2π.i(νUP−ν)+1T2UP+fUτEquation 9 where T 2U and T 2UPare the transverse relaxation times for free and bound USH-F9, respectively. To simulate the binding curve for a resonance in intermediate exchange, the two-site intermediate exchange model was coded into Mathematica (Wolfram Research, IL). For each point in the titration (i.e. each pair of values of U0 and P0 and [Pnr-NF]), the line-shape was calculated as the imaginary part of G(ν), and the frequency at which the signal amplitude was a maximum was determined. This simulated binding curve was compared with the experimental data by calculating the sum of the squares of the differences between the simulated and actual data (χ2). The values of νUP-νU , K a, andk off were varied in a grid search to find the best fit of the data to the model. Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in H2O/D2O (95:5) to a final concentration of 150 μm and treated with both 1.5 molar equivalents of ZnSO4 and 2 molar eq of tris(2-carboxyethylphosphine)·HCl. The pH was adjusted to 5.0 (using 10 mm NaOH), and sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. The samples were then concentrated by vacuum centrifugation (at 55 °C) to the required concentrations (see Table I). One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of each sample were acquired to confirm that they were correctly folded, and samples were dialyzed overnight into a buffer containing sodium acetate (20 mm, pH 5.0), ZnSO4 (1.5 mm), and tris(2-carboxyethylphosphine)·HCl (100 μm). Experiments at pH 7 were conducted in 20 mm MOPS buffer. Samples were degassed for 5 min immediately before the titrations. Titrations were carried out on a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. Of the two proteins samples to be used in each titration, 1.8 ml of the less concentrated protein sample was transferred into the cell, whereas the automatic injector was filled with the more concentrated protein (the titrant). Titrations involving USH-F1 and USH-F9 were conducted at 278 and 293 K, respectively. The titrant was automatically injected into the cell containing either its binding partner or buffer alone. For each titration, 15–20 injections were made at 5-min intervals, with each injection consisting of 10–15 μl of titrant. The reference power was set at 5 μcal s−1, and the cell was stirred continuously at 310 rpm. Data were analyzed using the Origin isothermal titration calorimetry analysis software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). A linear fit of the isotherm of the protein injected into buffer alone was subtracted from the experimental isotherms to account for the heat of dilution and mixing. A nonlinear least squares fit to a single binding site model was used to obtain values for the binding constant, stoichiometry, and heat of binding.Table IProtein concentrations used in isothermal titration calorimetry experimentsTitrationConcentration of protein (μm)USH-F1USH-F9GATA-NFPAN-NFGATA-NF into USH-F158700Pan-NF into USH-F115370USH-F1 into Pan-NF40018Pan-NF into USH-F98–17500–680GATA-NF into USH-F914650 Open table in a new tab Resonance assignment was carried out using the sequential assignment method. The three-dimensional HNHA experiment was used to assign the1H,15N HSQC of C32H. Cross-peaks in the two-dimensional NOE spectra were integrated in XEASY and converted to upper distance limits using the CALIBA module of DYANA (35Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar) and the default DYANA parameters. 3 J NHαcoupling constants were measured by analysis of the three-dimensional HNHA experiment. In combination with distance restraints, a set of allowable φ dihedral angles was generated using the GRIDSEARCH module of DYANA. Stereospecific assignments for 13 pairs of methylene protons were obtained from an analysis of E.COSY and short mixing time NOE spectra. Stereospecific assignments in conjunction with interproton distance restraints were used to generate a set of allowable χ1 dihedral angle restraints in the GRIDSEARCH module of DYANA. DYANA was used to calculate 50 structures from random starting conformers. Calculations were performed in the absence of zinc ligation restraints. The conformer with the lowest penalty function value was used as input for refinement by restrained molecular dynamics/simulated annealing calculations in CNS (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16915) Google Scholar). Zinc was incorporated into calculations by the introduction of covalent restraints to maintain tetrahedral geometry. Sγ-Zn and Nε2-Zn bond lengths were constrained to 2.3 and 2.0 Å, respectively, with force constants of 250 kcal mol−1 Å−2. Bond angles defining the zinc coordination site were constrained to the following values: 112° for Sγ-Zn-Sγ bond angles, 108° for Cβ-Sγ-Zn angles, 111° for Sγ-Zn-Nε2 angles, and 102° for Nε2-Zn-Nε2 angles. These values were applied with a force constant of 50 kcal mol−1deg−2. The standard protein all-hydrogen force field was used, and covalent geometry was constrained using standard CNS parameters. Calculations were performed in torsion-angle space, with randomized initial atomic velocities. The first stage consisted of a search of torsion-angle space at high temperature (50000 K), with 1000 time steps of 0.015 ps and a low weight on the repulsive energy term (w vdW = 0.1). Force constants for calculation of the square-well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were 150 kcal mol−1 Å−2 and 100 kcal mol−1deg−2, respectively. The second stage consisted of slow cooling torsion-angle dynamics, with 1000 time steps of 0.015 ps, in which the temperature decreased in 250-K steps. The weight on the repulsive energy term was increased to one, and force constants remained unaltered. The third and final stage consisted of 10 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization (for 1000 steps), with force constants for NOE and dihedral angle potentials changed to 50 kcal mol−1 Å−2 and 300 kcal mol−1deg−2, respectively. A total of 200 structures were calculated, and the 20 conformers with the lowest total energy were used to represent the solution structure of C32H. The structures were visualized and analyzed using the programs MOLMOL (37Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6453) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK-NMR (38Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). We first sought to determine the surface of USH-F9 that was responsible for its interaction with GATA family N-fingers. The GATA binding face of USH-F1 had previously been identified by carrying out a 1H,15N HSQC titration of15N-labeled USH-F1 with unlabeled murine GATA-NF (16Liew C.K. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Newton A. Sharpe B.K. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 1157-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Initially, the same methodology was employed for USH-F9. However, the addition of GATA-1 NF to 15N-labeled USH-F9 resulted in substantial line broadening in the 1H,15N HSQC, which prevented the assignment of peaks in the HSQC spectrum. Furthermore, it was clear that a great deal more GATA-NF would have been required to reach completion. Together these observations indicated that the kinetics and affinity of this interaction were different from those for formation of the USH-F1·GATA-1 NF complex. In an attempt to circumvent this problem, the titration was repeated using the Pannier N-finger (Pnr-NF). Pannier is the biological partner of U-shaped; its N-finger shares ∼90% sequence identity with that of murine GATA-1 N-finger, including all of the residues previously implicated in FOG binding (16Liew C.K.

We describe here the detailed characterization of the mouse sex-limited protein enhancer as a paradigm for androgen-specific control of gene expression. By deletion analysis, we delineate the minimal enhancer region displaying androgen sensitivity and specificity. We also show that each of the three hormone response elements (HRE), which constitute this minimal enhancer region, is essential but not sufficient for its functionality. When investigated as isolated elements, HRE1 is inactive and HRE3 is a potent androgen response element as well as GRE. Only the non-canonical HRE2 (5-TGGTCAgccAGTTCT-3′) is capable of conferring an androgen-specific transcriptional response to a heterologous promoter. This finding is correlated with the fact that HRE2 is recognized in binding assaysin vitro by the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the androgen but not the glucocorticoid receptor, while HRE3 is recognized by both DBDs. Differential binding of the androgen receptor to HRE2 in the context of the enhancer was analyzed in more detail in footprinting assays in vitro. In transient transfection experiments using chimeric receptors, the inability of the glucocorticoid receptor to transactivate via the slp-ARU as well as the isolatedslp-HRE2 was rescued by the replacement of its DNA-binding domain with that of the androgen receptor. Our data suggest that the functional interplay between the weak, but highly androgen-specific HRE2 and the adjacent strong, but non-selective HRE3 is the major determinant in the generation of androgen specificity of transcriptional response via the sex-limited protein enhancer.

J. 2002; 361: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), has long since posed the problem of how steroid-specific transcriptional regulation is achieved in the living cell. The DNA-binding domains (DBD) of the human PR group members are 71% identical and 84% homologous. The DBD of an SR is located in the central part of the receptor and is structured in two zinc fingers (3Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar, 4Luisi B.F., Xu, W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). From the crystal structure of the GR-DBD complexed with an HRE (4Luisi B.F., Xu, W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar), it is known that the amino-terminal zinc-finger contains an α-helical region that is inserted in the major groove of the DNA. This region (also called P-box) contains the amino acid residues that make base-specific contacts with the core hexamer SR recognition motif. The P-box residues are 100% conserved within the PR group of steroid hormone receptors, which all recognize and bind DNA motifs that are comprised of a three nucleotide spaced, partial inverted repeat of a 5′-TGTTCT-3′ motif. From the GR-DBD·DNA-bound co-crystal structure, it is known that the carboxyl-terminal zinc-finger of the DBD is involved in the cooperative “head-to-head” dimerization of two receptor DBDs on a palindromic repeat of the monomer binding motif. By analogy, this mode of interaction has been assumed to hold true for the other steroid hormone receptors as well. Indeed, all members of the PR group of steroid hormone receptors can activate transcription by interacting with a partial palindrome of the 5′-TGTTCT-3′ hexamer (2Verrijdt G. Haelens A.

Contrary to the classic hormone response elements, these motifs can be considered partial direct repeats of the canonical monomer binding motif and are found in most, if not all, of the enhancers or promoters that have been described to date to be androgen-specific in transient transfection assays (e.g. the rat probasin gene promoter, the mouse sex-limited protein, and human secretory component upstream enhancers, the mouse pem gene promoter). In our current hypothesis, the direct repeat nature of these elements is the main determinant involved in their specific action. The AR-DBD is the only SR-DBD that is able to cooperatively bind to such partially directly repeated elements, possibly by dimerizing on the DNA in a head-to-tail conformation, similar to the members of the all-trans-retinoic acid receptor/9-cis-retinoic acid receptor group of nuclear receptors (12Shaffer P.L. Gewirth D.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2242-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A more thorough analysis of the specific AR-, as opposed to GR-, DBD interaction to the ARE2 motif in the rat probasin promoter (13Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) has strengthened this hypothesis. Taken together, this alternative mechanism of DNA binding by the AR could constitute an important factor in the generation of androgen specificity of transcriptional control. The mouse sex-limited protein upstream androgen responsive unit (ARU) confers androgen responsiveness to a heterologous promoter in transient transfection assays (15Loreni F. Stavenhagen J. Kalff M. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Its androgen (versusglucocorticoid) specificity was reported in a later publication by the same research group (16Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and has since served as a paradigm of an androgen-specific response unit (e.g. Refs. 17Robins D.M. Scheller A. Adler A.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and 18Scarlett C.O. Scheller A. Thompson E. Robins D.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). From the three putative HRE motifs identified within the enhancer (HREs 1, 2, and 3), only HRE3 was considered a genuine functional SR interaction site (19Adler A.J. Scheller A. Hoffman Y. Robins D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for the androgen specificity of the enhancer was, therefore, attributed to the interaction of other transcription factors (e.g. OCT or AML/CBFα3) to the ARU and their cooperativity with HRE3-bound AR (18Scarlett C.O.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30624-30630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the detailed characterization of theslp-ARU and the interpretation of the obtained results in the light of our hypothesis of differential DNA recognition by the AR as a possible mechanism involved in specific transcriptional responses. By testing hormonal responsiveness of sequential deletions from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the enhancer, we delineate the minimal enhancer region necessary for full functionality and specificity. We also investigate the role of each of the HREs in the functionality of the enhancer by introducing a point mutation that destroys SR-DBD interaction. Of each of these motifs, we study the affinity for the AR- and GR-DBD in in vitro DNA binding assays, as well as their functionality and specificity as isolated elements in transient transfection assays. In addition, we study AR- and GR-DBD interaction with the different HREs in their native context in the enhancer, by in vitro footprinting experiments. Restriction and modifying enzymes were obtained from Invitrogen, Amersham Biosciences, Promega Corp. (Madison, WI), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and MBI Fermentas GMBH. Dexamethasone and methyltrienolone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The pGEM15Zf(−) cloning vector and the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter vector were obtained from Promega Corp. [α-32P]dCTP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) or Sigma-Genosys. The pTK-TATA-Luc reporter vector was made by inserting a SalI/BglII fragment from the modified pTK-CAT vector (7Claessens F. Alen P. Devos A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19013-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) in theBglII/SmaI-digested pGL3 basic reporter vector. The wild-type and mutant slp enhancer fragments (from nt −1981 to nt −1902) were generated by hybridizing two synthetic oligonucleotides, overlapping each other over 20 bp at their 3′-ends and containing EcoRI or BamHI restriction sites at their 5′-ends, followed by a fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The resulting fragments were cloned asEcoRI/BamHI fragments in pGEM15Zf(−) and from the resulting construct as XbaI/SacI fragments in the correct orientation in the pTK-TATA-Luc vector. For the sequential deletions from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the enhancer fragment, shorter oligonucleotides were used as 5′- or 3′-parts of the enhancer, as appropriate, and hybridized with the full-size, complementary oligonucleotide. For the 5′ deletions, oligonucleotide primers start at positions −1971, −1961, −1951, and −1941. For the 3′ deletions, oligonucleotides start at positions −1922 and −1932. These primer combinations resulted in the enhancer fragments described below in Fig.1. Oligonucleotides containing the HRE1, HRE2, HRE2–4T-A, HRE2–4T-A;+2A-T, HRE3, and rTAT-GRE motif (22Jantzen H.-M. Strähle U. Gloss B. Stewart F. Schmid W. Boshart M. Miksicek R. Schütz G. Cell. 1987; 49: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), in their original contexts (i.e. including the four nucleotides flanking the hexamer half sites and the three-nucleotide spacer), and as they were used in band shift assays, were cloned in theNheI-digested pTK-TATA-Luc vector, resulting in the insertion of two or four copies of the motif with alternating orientations, upstream of the minimal TK-TATA-box. All reporter plasmids used in this study were checked by sequence analysis on the ALF express sequencer using the Cycle Sequencing method (Amersham Biosciences). The numbering of the nucleotides within the 15-bp HRE sequence is according to Verrijdt et al. (23Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Haelens A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol.

The central spacer nucleotide is given position 0, the positions of the other nucleotides are indicated as − (upstream of the central nucleotide) or + (downstream of the central nucleotide). The rTAT-GRE-E1b-luciferase reporter contains two motifs of the rTAT-GRE, controlling the E1b minimal promoter and was a gift from Dr. Jenster (24Sui X. Bramlett K.S. Jorge M.C.

HeLa cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1000 mg/liter glucose, supplemented with penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. On the first day of each transfection experiment, cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at a density of 10,000 cells per well and grown in the presence of dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (5%). The second day, cells were transfected using the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Per well, 80 ng of luciferase reporter vector, 10 ng of an expression vector for the appropriate receptor, and 10 ng of an internal control plasmid (pCMV-βgal) was used. After overnight incubation, cells were grown in the presence or absence of either 1 nm of the synthetic androgen R1881 (methyltrienolone) or 10 nm of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. After 24 h, cells were harvested using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and luciferase activities of the cell lysates were measured in a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo Labsystems) using the Promega Luciferase Assay Reagent. β-Galactosidase activities of the same samples were measured using the Galacto-Light Chemiluminescent Reporter Gene Assay System (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Each transfection assay was performed in duplicate. The luciferase value of each sample was normalized to its β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase activities of the reporter constructs containing the slp enhancer fragments were calculated relative to the luciferase value of the construct containing the full-size wild-type enhancer, whose activity in the presence of 1 nm R1881 was set at 100. The activities of the reporter constructs containing two or four copies of the isolated motifs are represented as -fold induction due to hormone stimulation. The -fold induction is the ratio of the adjusted luciferase value of the stimulated duplicate samples over the average adjusted luciferase value of the corresponding samples, co-transfected with the same receptor expression plasmid, in the absence of hormone. In the calculation of S.E. values, each experiment, performed in duplicate, is considered a single experiment. The reported results are the averages of at least three independent experiments. The human AR, the rat GR, and the GAG chimer (a kind gift from Prof. D. M. Robins) receptor expression plasmids have been described previously (23Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Haelens A. Peeters B.

All samples that were stimulated with androgens were co-transfected with the AR expression plasmid; those stimulated with glucocorticoids with the GR or GAG chimer expression plasmid, as appropriate. Growth and purification of rat AR- and GR-DBD was performed as described previously (13Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GST-AR-DBD and GST-GR-DBD proteins were produced similarly, except for the fact that elution from the glutathione-Sepharose beads was done by adding a 100 μmsolution of reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. All slp-HRE oligonucleotides used in the band shift assays have XhoI- and NheI-overlapping ends and contain the slp-HRE hexamer motifs, all in their original contexts (i.e. the four nucleotides flanking the hexamer motifs and its three-nucleotide spacer). The oligonucleotide containing the rTAT-GRE motif had the following sequence: 5′-tcgagctgcTGTACAggaTGTTCTagctgctag-3′ (hexamer motifs are in capitals, flanking and spacer nucleotides are in small type, and restriction enzyme 5′ overhangs are in italic). Each couple of oligonucleotides was hybridized and 5′ overhanging ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (23Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Haelens A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12298-12305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A constant amount of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (a total of 20,000 cpm, corresponding to ± 10 fmol) was incubated with increasing amounts of receptor DBD. The percentage of radioactivity that was retarded by dimeric SR-DBD in each lane of the gel, relative to the total amount of radioactivity in that lane, was plotted against the protein concentration that was used. Radioactivity was measured in a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For the calculation of the apparent dissociation constants (K S), the data were analyzed using the SigmaPlot software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Best fits were calculated to four parameter curves with allosteric Hill kinetics. The amounts of AR- and GR-DBD used in the calculation ofK S values ranged from 0.1 ng (0.42 nmfor the AR-DBD, 0.44 nm for the GR-DBD) to 1.6 μg (6.8 and 7 μm for the AR- and GR-DBD, respectively). For the footprinting experiments, either aPstI/MluI fragment from the rTAT-GRE-E1b luciferase control vector or a EcoRI/XbaI fragment from the pGEM15Zf(−) plasmid containing the wild-type or mutated slp enhancer, was radiolabeled at the 3′-end by a fill-in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. In each footprinting reaction, 20,000–30,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe was used. Footprinting reactions were performed essentially according to Lemaigre et al. (26Lemaigre F.P. Courtois S.J. Lafontaine D.A. Rousseau G.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), except that no poly(dI·dC) was included in the binding reactions. G and AG chemical cleavage reactions, according to Maxam and Gilbert (27Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar), were performed on the same DNA fragment and were used as a reference in each footprinting gel. GST-AR- and GST-GR-DBD fragments were used as DBD fragments. Competition experiments consisted of the inclusion of 10 pmol (an approximate 400-fold excess) of cold competitor oligonucleotide containing the rTAT-GRE motif, in the binding mixture. The 80-bp full-size slp-enhancer fragment, as used in Ref. 23Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Haelens A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12298-12305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, was stepwise shortened from the 5′- and 3′-ends (Fig.1 A), and the resulting reporter constructs were tested in transient transfection assays (Fig.1 B). A deletion up to 30 bp from the 5′-end of the full-size enhancer has a minor effect on its androgen responsiveness, whereas the glucocorticoid response remains low. This 50-bp fragment (from nt −1902 to −1951) lacks three 5′-nucleotides of HRE1. The additional deletion of 10 bp from its 5′-end silences the enhancer. This deletion removes the entire HRE1, indicating the dependence of enhancer function on this DNA segment and that the joint action of the HREs 2 and 3 on themselves is not sufficient for the androgen response. A 20-bp deletion from the 3′-end of the ARU (del5 in Fig. 1) removes HRE3 and has a dramatic effect on the androgen responsiveness. The low, residual androgen sensitivity is lost upon the additional deletion of 10 bp, covering HRE2, from its 3′-end (del6). The minimal enhancer region necessary for functionality and specificity consists, therefore, merely of the HREs 2 and 3 and the downstream half of HRE1 (del3 in Fig. 1). As a positive control experiment for hormone induction, a promoter construct containing two copies of the nonspecific and high affinity rTAT-GRE was used. This reporter construct was always stimulated by androgens and glucocorticoids to the same extent, thereby indicating that both androgen and glucocorticoid signaling pathways are intact and functional in CV-1 cells. The same experiments and controls were also performed in HeLa cells and gave comparable results (data not shown). To investigate the role of each of the individual HREs in the functionality of theslp-ARU, the guanine at position 3 of the right half sites of the hexamer motif was replaced by a thymine (Fig.2 A), a mutation that is known to destroy high affinity interaction of any SR-DBD to the element. The hormone responsiveness of the corresponding reporter constructs was tested in transient transfection assays in CV-1 cells (Fig.2 B). The results show clearly that each mutation significantly affects the function of the enhancer, indicative of the crucial role of each motif, although the HRE1-mutated enhancer is still androgen-responsive. Its androgen-induced activity still rises up to almost 50% of that of the wild-type enhancer fragment and is more than 2-fold higher compared with the enhancer fragments containing the HRE2 or HRE3 mutant. Strikingly, the HRE2- and HRE3-mutated enhancer fragments display a similar decrease in hormone responsiveness and a comparable residual androgen sensitivity (androgen-mediated induction factors are 5.4 and 5.9, respectively). Radiolabeled probes containing the HRE1, -2, or -3 motifs were analyzed in band shift experiments in vitrousing recombinant AR- or GR-DBD fragments. As a positive control for AR- and GR-DBD binding, radiolabeled rat tyrosine aminotransferase (rTAT) GRE (5′-TGTACAggaTGTTCT-3′), which has been previously described as a classic, nonspecific HRE (2Verrijdt G.

For each of the four motifs, binding curves were generated, and best fits were calculated to a plot with four-parameter allosteric Hill kinetics (Fig.3). No significant interaction of AR- or GR-DBD to HRE1 could be demonstrated, even when using up to 1 μg of protein (Fig.3 A). Binding of the AR-DBD to HRE2 is sigmoidal, the plateau is reached at 400 ng of protein and an apparent dissociation constant (K S) of 186 nm was calculated. The GR-DBD displays a very weak interaction to HRE2. TheK S value is calculated at 775 nm. However, a plateau of only 30% of total binding is reached, even at GR-DBD concentrations of more than 10 μm (Fig.3 B). HRE3 is bound strongly by both AR- and GR-DBD (Fig. 3 C), although the affinity of the AR-DBD is significantly higher compared with the GR-DBD (K S values are 56 and 199 nm, respectively). The rTAT-GRE control was bound with identical affinities by the AR- and GR-DBD (K Svalues were 20 and 21 nm, respectively). Two and four copies of each of the motifs were cloned in a luciferase reporter vector upstream of the heterologous TK minimal promoter, and the hormone responsiveness of the resulting reporter constructs was evaluated in transient transfection assays in HeLa cells (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained in CV-1 cells (data not shown). In the negative control experiment, the empty promoter vector displays low activity that is not increased by hormone stimulation (empty vector inpanels A and B of Fig. 4). As a positive control for hormone induction, in each experiment a promoter construct was included containing two copies of the rTAT-GRE. The reporter construct containing two copies of HRE1 is not responsive to either androgens or glucocorticoids, and four copies of this element mediate a very weak 1.8- and 5-fold induction of transcriptional activity by androgens and glucocorticoids, respectively. Both two and four copies of the slp-HRE2 display functional androgen specificity: the reporter construct containing two copies is induced 3.6-fold by androgens and not (induction factor is 1.0) by glucocorticoids. Four copies of slp-HRE2 mediate a 41-fold induction by androgens, whereas glucocorticoid stimulation results in only a 5.3-fold stimulation of transcriptional activity. The reporter construct containing two copies of the high affinity HRE3 mediates a 26- and 10-fold increase of transcriptional activity upon androgen- and glucocorticoid stimulation, respectively. This correlates with the approximate 3-fold higher affinity of the AR-,versus the GR-, DBD for this element in the band shift experiments. Four copies of this element, however, stimulate transcription up to 160- and 170-fold upon androgen and glucocorticoid administration, respectively. To confirm the essential role of HRE2, not only in the activity, but also in the androgen specificity of the slp-ARU, we tested the effect of mutations in HRE2 on both the functionality of the isolated motif as well as of the full-size enhancer (Fig.5). In the first mutation, the thymine at position −4 was substituted for an adenine. This essentially changes the nature of the half site repeat from partially direct to partially palindromic (see also under “Discussion”). The specificity of theslp-ARU is lowered upon the introduction of this mutation in HRE2 (androgen induction remains 32, while glucocorticoid induction increases to 8.8). In the reporter constructs containing two copies of the slp-HRE2, the functional androgen specificity of the wild-type element is lost upon the substitution of the thymine at position −4 with an adenine. The -fold induction by androgens is 10, whereas glucocorticoids cause an 8-fold stimulation of activity. In the four-copy construct in"
https://openalex.org/W2022499708,"Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) activate promoters for key genes of metabolism to keep pace with the cellular demand for lipids. In each SREBP-regulated promoter, at least one ubiquitous co-regulatory factor that binds to a neighboring recognition site is also required for efficient gene induction. Some of these putative co-regulatory proteins are members of transcription factor families that all bind to the same DNA sequence elements in vitro and are often expressed in the same cells. These two observations have made it difficult to assign specific and redundant functions to the unique members of a specific gene family. We have used the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique coupled with a transient complementation assay in Drosophila SL2 cells to directly compare the ability of two members of the CREB/ATF family to function as co-regulatory proteins for SREBP-dependent activation of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter. Results from both of these experimental systems demonstrate that CREB is an efficient SREBP co-regulator but ATF-2 is not."

The functions of this activation in the damage response pathways remain obscure. To identify potential targets of c-Abl kinase, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a murine cDNA library. One c-Abl binding protein of particular interest was the large subunit (DDB1) of the heterodimeric complex with UV-damaged DNA binding activity (UV-DDB). This complex binds with high specificity to DNA damaged by UV, is absent in a subset of xeroderma pigmentosum group E cells, and is required for global genomic repair of UV-induced damage. The association of c-Abl with DDB1 required the kinase domain of c-Abl and preserved the interaction between DDB1 and the small subunit (DDB2) of the UV-DDB complex. Significantly, overexpression of c-Abl increased tyrosine phosphorylation of DDB2 and suppressed UV-DDB activity. Conversely, a dominant negative, kinase-deficient allele of c-Abl decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of DDB2 and dramatically stimulated UV-DDB activity. These results suggest that one role of c-Abl may be to negatively regulate UV-DDB activity by phosphorylation of DDB2.

Altered forms of the Abl kinase play pivotal roles in oncogenesis: the activated v-Abl kinase of the Abelson murine leukemia virus induces pre-B cell lymphoma in mice, and the Bcr-Abl fusion protein is responsible for the induction of chronic myelogenous leukemia in humans. However, the physiological functions of the wild type c-Abl kinase are far less clear. The N terminus of c-Abl contains Src homology domains 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2 and SH3, Src homology domains 2 and 3; UV-DDB, UV-damaged DNA binding activity; XP-E, xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DNA-PKCS, catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase; GGR, global genomic repair; c-Abl KR, kinase-deficient c-Abl. and a tyrosine kinase domain.

Genetic analyses in mice indicate that both the tyrosine kinase domain and the C-terminal segment of c-Abl are critical for the physiological function of c-Abl. Mice with deletions in the C terminus of c-Abl or in the entire c-Abl open reading frame exhibit essentially identical phenotypes, including high neonatal mortality, runting, defective T and B cell development, reduced fertility in males, and sterility in females (6Schwartzberg P.L.

It has been postulated that the kinase activity is negatively regulated by a factor binding to the SH3 domain of c-Abl (8Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). During integrin-mediated cell adhesion, cytoplasmic c-Abl kinase is activated in conjunction with the transient transport of c-Abl from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (9Lewis J.M. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The c-Abl kinase activity varies with the cell cycle, increasing in S phase, despite a constant level of c-Abl protein. Activation of c-Abl may be mediated by release from phosphorylated Rb during the G1-S transition (10Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). c-Abl can also be activated by growth factors (11Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Recently, c-Abl has been found to be activated by a variety of DNA-damaging agents (12Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P.

Ectopic expression of ATM leads to the phosphorylation of Ser-465 in the c-Abl kinase domain and activates c-Abl kinase activity (14Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E., Xu, Y.

To identify additional downstream targets of c-Abl, we utilized a yeast two-hybrid screen for new c-Abl binding proteins.

The interaction of c-Abl with the UV-DDB complex provides a new link between DNA damage and c-Abl activation. In this report we describe the nature of the interaction and provide evidence suggesting that c-Abl might inhibit UV-DDB activity by phosphorylating DDB2. Human 293 cells, which are immortalized by adenovirus, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Specialty Media) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Human WI38 cells and Chinese hamster V79 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained subconfluently. The yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out with a vector expressing a fragment of kinase-deficient c-Abl encoding amino acids 4–1087. The vector AGP5 was generated by partially digesting kinase-deficient c-Abl cDNA with restriction enzymeBglII and subcloning into the yeast two-hybrid vector SH2–1. Expression in mammalian cells was accomplished for wild type c-Abl, kinase-deficient c-Abl, various c-Abl truncation mutants, and Abi-1 by cloning the corresponding cDNAs into the expression vector pMT21. GST-C, which expresses the C-terminal part of c-Abl fused with the GST protein, was generated from a c-Abl fragment encoding amino acids 603–959 that was cloned in-frame into pGEX2TK (Amersham Biosciences). Other GST-Abl fusion protein constructs, GST-SH3, GST-SH2, and GST-SH2-PTK, were the kind gifts of Dr. A. M. Pendergast (32Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Maru Y. Witte O.N. Cell. 1991; 66: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The FLAG-DDB1, DDB1-HA, FLAG-DDB2 fusion proteins were all cloned into the mammalian expression vector pBJ5 with either the FLAG epitope fused to the region encoding the N terminus or the HA epitope fused to the region encoding the C terminus as previously described (37Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Each of these DDB1 and DDB2 constructs was previously shown to be active in reconstituting UV-DDB activity upon transfection into mammalian cells (37Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Yeast strain CTY10-5d (gift of Dr. R. Sternglanz, State University of New York, Stony Brook) were transformed by the bait construct AGP5. CTY10-5d cells expressing AGP5 were then transformed with a murine WEHI-3 cDNA library by the standard lithium acetate method (35Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Double transformants were selected on His− and Leu− plates and screened for LacZ expression by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining of a filter lift. Total DNA from colonies expressingLacZ genes was isolated and used to transform DH5α bacteria. Plasmid DNA was isolated from ampicillin-resistant clones and retested by cotransfection with either SH2–1 or AGP5 for bait-dependent LacZ expression in CTY10-5d. The plasmids conferring bait-dependent LacZ expression were sequenced with a standard dideoxy chain termination method. Human 293 cells (1 × 106) were plated on 60-mm diameter dishes and transfected by the standard calcium phosphate transfection method (33Wigler M. Sweet R. Sim G.K. Wold B. Pellicer A. Lacy E. Maniatis T. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1979; 16: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 μg of total DNA was used for the transfection of cells in one 60-mm dish. Calcium phosphate precipitates were left on cells overnight. Cells were washed and fed with fresh medium the next day and collected 40–48 h after transfection. Hamster V79 cells (5 × 105) were transfected with FLAG-DDB2 (2 μg) and DDB1-HA (2 μg) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Cells were washed and fed with fresh medium the next day, and 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with UV (8 J/m2) or IR (10 Gy) light. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (35Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Escherichia colicells harboring a GST expression construct were grown to mid-log phase and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were suspended in TNENI buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of each pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin), and disrupted by sonication. The GST fusion protein was affinity-purified from clarified lysates with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The amount and homogeneity of proteins bound to beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Human 293 cells expressing appropriate proteins were solubilized with TNENI buffer. Proteins extracted from 293 cells were mixed with 50 μg of purified GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rocking, and the beads were washed four times with TNENI buffer. Bound materials were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide), blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with appropriate antibodies. After transfection with a combination of different plasmids, 293 cells were extracted with either EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mmNaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) or radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell extracts were incubated with appropriate antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins bound to antibodies were collected by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h. After washing, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (IBI-Kodak) was used to immunoprecipitate proteins with the FLAG epitope. Whole cell extracts or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE; transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell); probed with rabbit anti-Abl antibody (K-12) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-Myc antibody (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M-2) (IBI-Kodak); and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Antibody binding was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Biosciences). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20) (Transduction Laboratories) was used to detect phosphotyrosine. Total RNA was extracted from 293 cells transfected with different constructs by RNAzol B kit (Tel-Test), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A probe for DDB1 was generated by digesting DDB1 cDNA with EcoRI andEagI. A probe for DDB2 was generated by digesting the DDB2 expression construct with XhoI and XbaI. DNA fragments were isolated from a 1% agarose gel and labeled with [32P]dCTP with an oligo labeling kit (AmershamBiosciences). RNA was denatured, resolved by 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel, transferred to Nytran Plus (Schleicher & Schuell), and cross-linked with UV (Stratalinker, Stratagene). Total RNA (30 μg) was loaded on each lane. The membrane was prehybridized in QuickHyb (Stratagene) at 65 °C for 4 h and hybridized with32P-labeled probe in QuickHyb overnight. The membrane was washed twice for 30 min with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, washed once with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min, and then exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. Cytoplasmic RNA was harvested from WI38 cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was quantitated using a RiboGreen RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes). RNA was run on a 1% agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond N+ nitrocellulose using the NorthenMax-Gly blotting kit (Ambion). Radiolabeled RNA probes and DNA probes were synthesized using the Strip-EZ kit (Ambion). Blots were stripped and re-probed sequentially. Confluent cells from 60-mm plates were harvested in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells are washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and once with buffer A (10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). This supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic extract. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A plus 1% Nonidet P-40, and the cell suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 10 min with gentle shaking. Cell lysates were microcentrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 s. The cell pellet was washed with 300 μl of buffer A by gentle pipetting and microcentrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 s. The cell pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol (v/v), 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). The suspensions were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min, and lysates were clarified by microcentrifuging at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. This supernatant became the nuclear extract. Nuclear extracts were assayed for UV-DDB activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described previously (21Hwang B.J. Chu G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 148-bp DNA probe (f148) was labeled by [32P]dCTP with Klenow enzyme and either left intact or damaged with UV at a dose of 4000 J/m2. A 10-μl reaction included 2 μl of 5× binding buffer (12 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 4 mm Tris, 0.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm DDT, and 12% glycerol), 1 ng of f148 probe, 3 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of plasmid DNA, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 1 μg of nuclear extract. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and resolved by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis at 10 V/cm at room temperature. The gel was dried onto a Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. To identify cellular proteins that interact with c-Abl, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system (34Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar). A fragment of a kinase-deficient c-Abl mutant encoding amino acids 4–1087 was fused to the LexA DNA binding domain to form plasmid construct AGP5. This construct was used as the bait for the two-hybrid screen, because it expresses a stable protein, does not activate reporter β-galactosidase expression by itself, and lacks tyrosine kinase activity, avoiding potential toxicity to yeast cells. Yeast cells expressing the c-Abl mutant were transformed with a mouse WEHI-3 cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain (35Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Twenty positive clones were obtained by screening one million yeast colonies. One positive clone contained a cDNA encoding the large subunit of the UV-DDB complex, corresponding to amino acid 689–1140 of DDB1, fused in-frame with the Gal4 activation domain. This clone did not interact with several unrelated control plasmids, such as Axl, Tyro3, laminin, or the human immunodeficiency virus integrase, suggesting that the interaction was specific. To confirm the interaction between c-Abl and DDB1, we tested the ability of DDB1 to bind to a series of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing different fragments of c-Abl (Fig.1). Abi-1, a previously identified Abl binding protein that binds to both the SH3 domain and the C terminus (35Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 36Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), was used as a control. GST fusion proteins were generated, and a comparable amount of each protein was bound to glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with cell extracts of 293 cells expressing Myc-tagged Abi-1 or FLAG-tagged DDB1, which was previously shown to be active in reconstituting UV-DDB activity (37Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Materials bound to beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and examined by immunoblot. As expected, Abi-1 was bound by Abl constructs containing the SH3 or C-terminal region of Abl but not other constructs (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, DDB1 was bound only by a GST fusion containing the protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain but not other GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1 A). In particular, GST-SH2PTK, but not GST-SH2, associates with DDB1, suggesting that the PTK domain of c-Abl might be responsible for the binding between c-Abl and DDB1. The structures of GST-Abl fusion proteins and their abilities to associate with either DDB1 or Abi-1 are summarized in Fig. 1 B. To test whether the interaction between c-Abl and DDB1 occurs in vivo, human 293 cells were cotransfected with constructs expressing c-Abl and either FLAG-tagged DDB1, FLAG-tagged DDB2, or HA-tagged DDB1. Each of the tagged constructs was shown to be active in reconstituting UV-DDB activity upon transfection into mammalian cells (37Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Indeed, FLAG-DDB2 was shown to be equivalent to DDB2 in conferring global genomic repair to intact cells (31Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Abl antibodies. As seen in Fig. 2, c-Abl was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-DDB1 but not FLAG-DDB2 (lanes 3 and 4). However, c-Abl was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-DDB2 if DDB1-HA was also present (lane 5), suggesting that DDB1 can act to bridge the binding between c-Abl and DDB2. This finding is consistent with the finding that DDB1 associates with DDB2 as a heterodimer (22Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It also suggests that the association of c-Abl with DDB1 preserves the interaction between DDB1 and DDB2 and that these three molecules are able to form a stable complex in vivo. To further map the region of c-Abl interacting with DDB1 in vivo, we generated various c-Abl mutants and tested them in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. The nuclear localization signal was retained in each of these c-Abl mutants. In fact, overexpressed c-Abl and FLAG-DDB1 localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (data not shown). The c-Abl mutants and FLAG-DDB1 were coexpressed in 293 cells, lysates were prepared, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Abl antibodies, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot. Kinase-deficient c-Abl (c-Abl KR) and wild type c-Abl interacted equally well with DDB1 (Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and3), consistent with the fact that DDB1 was isolated with a c-Abl KR fragment as bait in the original yeast two-hybrid screen. A c-Abl mutant with a deletion of the PTK domain failed to associate with FLAG-DDB1 (Fig. 3 A, lane 8), whereas a minimal c-Abl construct containing only the PTK domain and the nuclear localization signal coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-DDB1 (Fig.3 A, lane 7). Fig. 3 B shows the c-Abl constructs and summarizes the ability of each to bind FLAG-DDB1. We conclude that the PTK domain was necessary and sufficient for the interaction between c-Abl and DDB1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that c-Abl associates with DDB1 both in vitro and in vivo and that the PTK domain of c-Abl is responsible for the binding between c-Abl and DDB1. We wished to determine whether changes in c-Abl might affect the levels of UV-DDB activity in intact cells. Human 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for wild type c-Abl and various c-Abl mutants and then analyzed for UV-DDB activity. Transfection efficiencies were over 80% as measured by β-galactosidase staining of cells expressing a control β-galactosidase cDNA (data not shown). Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection and assayed for UV-DDB activity with an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The constitutive level of UV-DDB was established in mock transfected 293 cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4). As previously reported (37Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the binding activity indicated as bands B1 and B2 was specific for UV-damaged DNA and thus identified as UV-DDB. In particular, UV-DDB was absent for the undamaged probe (lane 1), present for the UV-damaged probe (lane 2), resistant to competition from undamaged DNA (lane 3), and sensitive to competition from undamaged DNA (lane 4). The effects of c-Abl on UV-DDB activity were determined in 293 cells transfected with expression vectors for wild type or mutant c-Abl. Overexpression of c-Abl caused a reproducible decrease in UV-DDB (compare lanes 5 and 6). A kinase-deficient mutant of c-Abl, K298R, which has been used by other investigators to produce a dominant negative effect on endogenous c-Abl activity (38Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Goga A. Havlik M. Witte O. Cell. 1994; 77: 121-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), dramatically increased UV-DDB activity (compare lanes 5 and7). This increased binding activity was specific for UV-damaged DNA, because it was sensitive to competition from UV-damaged DNA (lane 10) but unaffected by undamaged DNA (lane 9). The changes in UV-DDB activity induced by wild type and kinase-deficient c-Abl required interaction with DDB1, because expression of c-Abl ΔPTK, a c-Abl mutant that fails to bind DDB1, had no effect on UV-DDB activity (compare lanes 5 and8). The successful expression of the mutant Abl alleles was confirmed in each case by immunob"

In this study, we demonstrate that serine 146 is required for two crucial features of CDC25B1. It is essential for CDC25B1 to function as a mitotic inducer and to prevent CDC25B1 export from the nucleus. We also show that serine 146 is phosphorylated in vitro by CDK1-cyclin B. However, phosphorylation of CDC25B does not stimulate its phosphatase activity, and mutation of serine 146 had no effect on its catalytic activity. Serine 146 phosphorylation is proposed to be a key event in the regulation of the CDC25B function in the initiation of mammalian mitosis.

Serine 146 phosphorylation is proposed to be a key event in the regulation of the CDC25B function in the initiation of mammalian mitosis. The first member of the CDC25 family was identified in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a dose-dependent inducer of mitosis (1Russell P. Nurse P. Cell. 1986; 45: 781-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Since then, homologous regulators have been found in every eukaryotic organism examined. Meanwhile, the biochemical properties of CDC25 were deciphered and its essential role in the control of the activation of CDC2 by dephosphorylation was characterized. CDC25 is a dual specificity phosphatase that directly activates the CDC2 kinase at the G2/M transition by dephosphorylating tyrosine 15 and threonine 14 (2). In yeast, there is only one form of CDC25, whereas in human cells three CDC25 phosphatase genes have been identified (3Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 67: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 4Nagata A. Igarashi M. Jinno S. Suto K. Okayama H. New Biol. 1991; 3: 959-968PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sadhu K.

Although they share about 50% similarity at the protein level, they are involved in specific regulatory processes. CDC25C and CDC25B are thought to activate CDK 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LMB, leptomycin B; NLS, nuclear localization signal. -cyclin complexes at the G2/M transition, and CDC25A regulates G1/S complexes, respectively (6Hoffmann I.

In fact, the exact role of CDC25B is still controversial (9Karlsson C. Katich S. Hagting A. Hoffmann I. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). On the basis of antisense oligonucleotide studies, it has been proposed that CDC25B is required for progression in S phase (10Garner-Hamrick P.A. Fisher C. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Other reports are more in favor of a role for CDC25B in late G2 as a regulator of centrosomal microtubule nucleation (11Gabrielli B.G., De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clarck J.M. Hatward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J. Cell. Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and as a starter of mitosis (9Karlsson C. Katich S. Hagting A. Hoffmann I. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Nishijima H. Nishitani H. Seki T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ablation of CDC25B by microinjection of specific antibodies blocks cell cycle progression by inhibition of entry into mitosis (13Lammer C. Wagerer S. Saffrich R. Mertens D. Ansorge W. Hoffman I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since several different isoforms of CDC25B have been detected in human cells (14Baldin V. Cans C. Superti-Furga G. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Forrest A.R. McCormack A.K. DeSouza C.P. Sinnamon J.M. Tonks I.D. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. Gabrielli B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and since the above mentioned studies made no distinction between CDC25B variants, we cannot exclude the possibility that each isoform has a specific function at a particular stage of the cell cycle or in a defined subcellular compartment. The activity of CDC25 phosphatases is regulated both at the translational and the post-translational levels. CDC25A and CDC25B expression appears to be cell cycle-regulated, whereas CDC25C is fairly constant. Phosphorylation of CDC25 is an important regulator of its phosphatase activity. CDC25C undergoes extensive phosphorylation of its NH2-terminal regulatory domain at mitosis, and this strongly stimulates its catalytic activity toward CDK1-cyclin B, thus creating a positive feedback loop (16Hoffmann I. Clarke P. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 17Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Similarly, CDC25A is phosphorylated and activated by CDK2-cyclin E at the G1/S transition and in turn dephosphorylates and fully activates that complex (18Hoffmann I. Draetta G.F. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). It has been shown that CDC25B is phosphorylated in cell extracts prepared from cells in S-phase to mitosis, and it has been proposed that it is consequently activated (13Lammer C. Wagerer S. Saffrich R. Mertens D. Ansorge W. Hoffman I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gabrielli B.G. Clarck J.M. McCormack A. Ellem K.A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28607-28614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CDC25B is an unstable protein, and phosphorylation also participates in the regulation of its degradation (12Nishijima H. Nishitani H. Seki T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); it is degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner upon phosphorylation by CDK1-cyclin A (20Baldin V. Cans C. Knibiehler M. Ducommun B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32731-32735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As already mentioned, we and others have identified at least three splice variants of CDC25B (14Baldin V. Cans C. Superti-Furga G. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Forrest A.R. McCormack A.K. DeSouza C.P. Sinnamon J.M. Tonks I.D. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. Gabrielli B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These three isoforms differ by the presence or the absence of two peptides, peptide A (14 residues) and peptide B (41 residues), which are both located in the amino terminus regulatory region of the phosphatase. These two peptides lie in domains that are fairly well conserved between evolutionarily distant members of the CDC25 family (14Baldin V. Cans C. Superti-Furga G. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that serine 146, a phosphorylation site located within domain B, is essential for the mitotic inducer activity associated with the nuclear retention of CDC25B1. pET14b- and pcDNA3-derived plasmids containing CDC25B and the N-terminal deletion mutants are described elsewhere (14Baldin V. Cans C. Superti-Furga G. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Baldin V. Cans C. Knibiehler M. Ducommun B. J. Biol.

Clarke P. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. G. Draetta (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy). HeLa cells and U2OS cells were grown as previously described (21Davezac N. Baldin V. Gabrielli B. Forrest A. Theis-Febvre N. Yashida M. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2179-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To obtain cells arrested in mitosis, HeLa cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence of 250 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma). Lovastatine and hydroxyurea were used at a concentration of 40 μm and 10 mm, respectively, to obtain cells either in G1 or at the G1 to S transition (14Baldin V. Cans C. Superti-Furga G. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected using Exgen-500 (Euromedex) following the manufacturer's instructions. The U2OS cell line conditionally expressing HA-tagged CDC25B1 (under the control of the tet promoter) is described elsewhere. 2N. Theis-Febvre, B. Ducommun, and V. Baldin, submitted for publication. Expression of CDC25B1 was induced by tetracycline removal from the culture medium, and cells were harvested 24 h latter. Exponentially growing cells, drug-arrested cells, or transfected HeLa cells were lysed in LB buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in presence of protease inhibitors: leupeptin (5 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml),l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (20 μg/ml), 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (20 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (17 μg/ml), calpain inhibitor I (20 μg/ml), and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) (except for phosphatase assays) for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined. In the case of nocodazole-arrested cells, a total cell extract was directly used for phosphorylation assay, or in some experiments CDK1-cyclin B was immunoprecipitated using anti-cyclin B antibody. 3V. Baldin, unpublished data. In the case of transfected cells, HA-tagged CDC25B1 or S146G-CDC25B1 proteins were immunoprecipitated using 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the HA epitope (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then used in phosphatase assay or Western blot analysis. Western blot analyses were performed with the CDC25B C-terminal peptide antibody (1:2000). In vitro transcription and translation of CDC25B and mutant proteins were performed using the TNT-quick system (Promega) in the presence or absence of [35S]methionine. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were maintained in Insect X-press medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Eurobio), gentamicin (250 μg/ml), amphotericin B (2.5 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 27 °C. For CDK-cyclin complex expression, Sf9 cells were seeded at a density of 60,000 cells/cm2 1 day prior to the infection and then co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding human CDK1 (CDC2) and cyclin B. Insect cell extracts were prepared 72 h postinfection as follows. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) using a Dounce homogenizer and then diluted in 4 volumes of solubilization buffer (25 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Tween 20) and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. GST-CDC25B1, GST-S146G-CDC25B1, and GST-CDC25C fusion proteins produced in bacteria were purified as previously described (16Hoffmann I. Clarke P. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In vitro translated protein or recombinant GST fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-CDC25B polyclonal antibody directed against a C-terminal peptide of CDC25B and incubated with 15 μg of cellular extract from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells or 200 μg of different cellular extracts, respectively, in kinase assay buffer (16Hoffmann I.

The precipitates were subjected to SDS-8% PAGE electrophoresis. Peptide phosphorylation was performed in the same kinase assay condition except that we used immunoprecipitated CDK1-cyclin B instead of total cell lysate, and the reaction was carried out in 30 min at 30 °C. In the indicated experiments, histone H1 kinase activity was determined on an immunoprecipitation performed with anti-cyclin B antibodies on 200 μg of cell extracts (23Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Lukas J.

Recombinant GST fusion proteins (CDC25B1, S146G-CDC25B1, and CDC25C) were incubated with 400 μg of nocodazole-arrested HeLa cells extracts in kinase assay buffer in presence of 1 mm ATP, 10 μg of creatine kinase, and 10 mm creatine phosphate for 30 min at 30 °C. Recombinant proteins were recovered on glutathione beads, washed three times with LB buffer in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors (NaF and Na3VO4), and washed once with phosphatase buffer (30 mm Tris pH 8.2, 75 mm NaCl, 0.67 mm EDTA, 0.033% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol). CDC25 B phosphatase activity was determined using fluorescein diphosphate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as substrate at the final concentration of 20 μm for 30 min at room temperature as described (24Rice R. Rusnak J.M. Yokokawa F. Yokokawa S. Messner D.J. Boynton A.L. Wipf P. Lazo J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15965-15974Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was monitored using a multiwell plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent, Labsystems; excitation filter, 485 nm; emission filter, 538 nm). The phosphatase activity of HA-CDC25B1 or HA-S146G-CDC25B1 expressed in HeLa cells was determined as described above after immunoprecipitation from cell lysates with anti-HA antibody. HeLa cells seeded on glass coverslips were transfected, and cells were fixed 24 h latter using 3.7% formaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 and cold methanol. HA-CDC25B1 and HA-mutants were detected by incubating first the coverslips with 12CA5 mouse monoclonal (1:2500) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by a second incubation with Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:500) (Molecular Probes). In all cases, DNA was visualized using Hoechst 33258 dye at 1 μg/ml (Sigma). The mitotic index was calculated by monitoring the cells (transfected or not) presenting a condensed chromatin aspect. In order to study the in vivo activity of CDC25B1 phosphatase, we expressed an HA epitope-tagged version of the wild type CDC25B1 in asynchronous HeLa cells under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The transfected cells were identified and monitored by immunofluorescence staining with anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, CDC25B1 acted as an inducer of mitosis, since, 24 h after transfection, about 20% of the cells expressing the CDC25B1 phosphatase displayed a condensed chromatin aspect. In contrast, this mitotic inducing activity was abolished with CDC25B1-S146G, a mutant protein that was tested in the course of a systematic study on putative phosphorylation sites. This serine, located in the alternately spliced B domain, is reminiscent of a CDK consensus phosphorylation site and is conserved in most of the CDC25 sequences from various eukaryotic species (14Baldin V. Cans C. Superti-Furga G. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Using a cell line conditionally expressing HA-CDC25B1, we show that, as inferred from its electrophoretic mobility shift, CDC25B1 was strongly phosphorylated in cells that were arrested at mitosis by a nocodazole treatment (Fig.2 A, upper panel). This effect correlated with a high level of CDK1-cyclin B kinase activity (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). We next investigated whether serine 146 was a phosphorylation site for the CDK1/CDC2 protein kinase. Using a set of amino-terminally truncated CDC25B1 proteins generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 2 B), we found that deletion of the first 274 residues fully abolished the phosphorylation of the protein, indicating that major phosphorylation sites for CDK1-cyclin B are all located in that amino-terminal region. Deletion of 186 residues of CDC25B already had a dramatic effect on its phosphorylation, but a shorter deletion (Δ108) had no detectable impact (Fig.2 C). These results indicate that the region ranging from amino acids 108 to 186 comprises one or several residues that is (are) directly phosphorylated. Alternatively, this region may be required for the phosphorylation of a site located elsewhere in the protein. We next examined whether the synthetic 42-residue peptide containing serine 146 that is located between residues 108 and 186 was phosphorylated in vitro by CDK1-cyclin B. As shown in Fig.3 A, CDK1-cyclin B immunoprecipitate readily phosphorylated it (lanes 1 and 2), whereas control immunoprecipitates did not (lanes 3 and 4). The serine 146 residue was then mutated to a nonphosphorylatable residue, and the kinetics of phosphorylation of both S146G-CDC25B1 mutant and wild type CDC25B1 by CDK1-cyclin B were analyzed. As shown in the autoradiography (Fig. 3 B, left panels), the S146G-CDC25B1 mutant did not display the electrophoretic mobility shift that rapidly occurs upon phosphorylation of wild-type CDC25B1 by CDK1-cyclin B and was less efficiently phosphorylated. Consonant with this observation, quantification of the level of 32P incorporation (Fig. 3 B, right panel) indicated that the overall phosphorylation of S146G-CDC25B1 was about 50% of that observed in the wild-type CDC25B1 protein. To confirm this observation, an in vitro phosphorylation assay with recombinant GST-CDC25B1 proteins and mitotic HeLa cell extract obtained by nocodazole treatment was performed. As shown in Fig. 3 C, upon incubation, wild type CDC25B1 displayed changes in its electrophoretic mobility that were only partially observed in the case of the S146G mutant protein, the band of highest electrophoretic mobility and the additional smear being absent. When the HeLa cell extract was depleted from CDK1-cyclin B activity by cyclin B immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3 E) prior to the incubation with CDC25B1, the electrophoretic mobility shift of the protein was fully abolished (Fig. 3 D, lane 3). Taken together, these data indicate that serine 146 is phosphorylatedin vitro by the CDK1-cyclin B complex. Several reports have described the activation of CDC25A and CDC25C phosphatases by CDC2-dependent phosphorylation (16Hoffmann I. Clarke P. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar,18Hoffmann I. Draetta G.F. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). On the basis of indirect evidence, it was also proposed that CDC25B is similarly regulated (13Lammer C. Wagerer S. Saffrich R. Mertens D. Ansorge W. Hoffman I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined this hypothesis and the possibility that serine 146 participates in the activation of CDC25B1. To address this question, we prepared both wild-type and S146G mutant recombinant proteins in fusion with GST by expression in Escherichia coli and affinity purification on glutathione-Sepharose. A GST-CDC25C protein was also produced in the same way. These purified proteins were incubated in the presence of mitotic cell extracts prepared from nocodazole-treated HeLa cells to allow their phosphorylation by CDK-cyclin complexes (Fig.4 A). The GST fusion proteins were recovered from the incubation mix by affinity purification, and the phosphatase activity of CDC25B was then quantified. As shown in Fig. 4 B, we found that the specific activities of unmodified CDC25B and S146G-CDC25B1 recombinant proteins were identical (271 and 259 units, respectively) and about 9-fold higher than the activity of CDC25C (28 units). As expected, the activity of recombinant CDC25C was amplified 6–7-fold upon phosphorylation by a mitotic extract. However, in contrast and in disagreement with what has been proposed by others (13Lammer C. Wagerer S. Saffrich R. Mertens D. Ansorge W. Hoffman I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the phosphatase activity of recombinant CDC25B was not increased following incubation and phosphorylation with a mitotic extract. Thus, CDC25B activity is not up-regulated upon phosphorylation by CDK1, and mutation of serine 146 has no effect on the catalytic activity of this phosphatase. We also next examined whether a down-regulation of the catalytic activity of CDC25B1 in vivo could account for the observation that the S146G mutation abolished the mitotic inducing effect. The phosphatase activity of wild type CDC25B1 and S146G-CDC25B1 was monitored in HeLa cells transfected with the corresponding HA-tagged constructs. After immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies, the phosphatase activity was measured. As shown in Fig.4 C, the phosphatase activities of these two enzymes were found to be very similar. Thus, the role of serine 146 in the mitotic inducer effect of CDC25B1 does not appear to depend on a change of its catalytic activity. The intracellular localization of CDC25B1 was investigated by immunofluorescence staining in exponentially growing HeLa cells transfected with constructs allowing the expression of the wild-type and the S146G-CDC25B1 mutant proteins. As we previously reported (21Davezac N. Baldin V. Gabrielli B. Forrest A. Theis-Febvre N. Yashida M. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2179-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), in the case of wild type CDC25B1 expression, the percentage of cells displaying either a strictly nuclear or cytoplasmic localization pattern was 15 and 20%, respectively (Fig.5 A). In contrast, in cells expressing the S146G-CDC25B1 mutant, the percentage of exclusive nuclear localization was only about 5%, whereas in about 45% of the cells, the localization of the protein was entirely cytoplasmic. Thus, it appears that the mutation of serine 146 impairs the ability of CDC25B1 protein to be located within the nucleus and favors its retention in the cytoplasmic compartment. Since it is likely that CDC25 proteins shuttle between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, this defect in nuclear localization may be due either to altered nuclear import or to deficient nuclear retention. We further examined this issue using leptomycin B (LMB), a potent CRM1 exportin inhibitor (25Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Wild-type CDC25B1 was almost totally retained in the nucleus in HeLa cells treated with LMB (Fig. 5 B). Similarly, the mutant protein CDC25B1-S146G was also detected in the nucleus in 86% of the cells, indicating that it was correctly targeted to the nucleus but not exported because of the presence of leptomycin B. In contrast, a CDC25B1 mutant protein with an inactivating mutation of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) (i.e. the replacement of the KRR motif by AGA (21Davezac N. Baldin V. Gabrielli B. Forrest A. Theis-Febvre N. Yashida M. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2179-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)) was incapable of being targeted to the nucleus (Fig. 5 B). Thus, we can conclude that the S146G mutation does not impair entry of CDC25B1 into the nucleus but alters its retention. The effect of the subcellular localization of CDC25B1 on its activity as an inducer of mitosis was further examined. This effect was found to be dependent on the nuclear localization of CDC25B1, since when an NLS-mutant was expressed, the percentage of cells in mitosis was decreased to 7.7%, a level similar to that observed in control pcDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6). Furthermore, in the presence of LMB, about 20% of the cells expressing the wild-type CDC25B1 entered mitosis, whereas only about 8% of the cells expressing the CDC25B1-S146G mutant did so (Fig. 6). These results indicate that localization of CDC25B1 into the nucleus is required for its mitotic inducer function. However, when CDC25B1-S146G is artificially tethered within the nucleus by LMB, it fails to act as a mitotic inducer, indicating that this function probably requires an additional nuclear event that is also dependent on serine 146 (see “Discussion”). The work presented here stems from the observation that a mutation of serine 146 glycine abolishes the mitotic inducing effect of the CDC25B1 phosphatase and reports the experiments that have been undertaken to identify the molecular basis of that observation. We have found that serine 146 is one of the major sites of CDC25B1 phosphorylation in vitro by CDK1-cyclin B. Serine 146 is included in the alternately spliced domain B, a 41-residue peptide that is present in the CDC25B1 and -B3 variants but absent in CDC25B2. As we reported when CDC25B splicing variants were identified (14Baldin V. Cans C. Superti-Furga G. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), this domain is conserved between species. In some cases, a threonine residue replaces the serine, but this phosphorylatable amino acid is always followed by a proline. Furthermore, this residue is conserved between the three human CDC25s, and it has recently been shown that alternative splicing of this domain also exists in the other human CDC25 phosphatase (26Wegener S. Hampe W. Herrmann D. Schaller H.C. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 810-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Such a conservation of the genomic organization of the CDC25 locus is likely to reflect a crucial functional role for this region of the protein. However, structural data are still missing to help in clarifying this issue. We have shown that CDC25B catalytic activity is not up-regulated upon phosphorylation by CDK1-cyclin B, and its specific activity is already high when compared with CDC25C. Furthermore, using recombinant CDK-cyclin complexes produced and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (CDK2/E, CDK2/A, CDK1/A), we also did not observe any increase of the catalytic activity of CDC25B1. 4V. Baldin and C. Cans, unpublished data. Thus, in contrast to what has been reported for CDC25A and CDC25C (16Hoffmann I. Clarke P. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 18Hoffmann I. Draetta G.F. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), CDC25B activity appears to be constitutively high and not up-regulated by CDK-cyclin complexes. We demonstrate here that nuclear targeting of CDC25B1 is essential to activate entry into mitosis. The loss of function of the S146G-CDC25B1 mutant together with its predominant cytoplasmic localization led us to examine the effect of a nuclear localization signal mutation. We have shown that the NLS-mutant is fully retained in the cytoplasm and that it is not active either as a mitotic inducer. Together, these results indicated that cytoplasmic accumulation of the CDC25B1 phosphatase had no detectable effect on the triggering of mitotic events. At least as far as CDC25B1 is concerned, our data do not support the proposal that cytoplasmic accumulation of CDC25B phosphatase at mitosis triggers centrosomal microtubule nucleation, whereas CDC25C regulates nuclear G2/M events (11Gabrielli B.G., De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clarck J.M. Hatward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J. Cell. Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, the activity of CDC25B is suggested to be required to activate the cytoplasmic pool of CDK1-cyclin B, which is responsible for the earliest changes in microtubule dynamics. Of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that another variant of CDC25B may be specifically targeted to CDK1-cyclin B complexes associated with the cytoskeleton and therefore involved in the regulation of its dynamics. In fact, the CDC25B3 variant was used in Gabrielli's work, where it was shown to cause the formation of abnormal minispindles upon overexpression (11Gabrielli B.G., De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clarck J.M. Hatward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J. Cell. Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions (i.e. with CDC25B1) we did not observe these minispindles; however, we found that the CDC25B3 variant is a less potent inducer of mitosis than CDC25B1, with only about 10% of cells in mitosis 24 h after transfection (data not shown). The data reported in this study demonstrate that CDC25B1 must be targeted to the nucleus to exert its mitotic inducer effect. This localization is dependent both on the integrity of its nuclear localization signal and on the integrity of the phosphorylatable serine 146. Nevertheless, the nuclear localization of CDC25B1 is not sufficient in itself to trigger mitosis, as demonstrated by the lack of induction of mitosis when the S146G-CDC25B1 mutant is retained in the nucleus by leptomycin B. This observation indicates the existence of an additional level of regulation that is essential for access to the nuclear substrates and that is likely to be dependent on serine 146 phosphorylation. Furthermore, only about 20% of the cells expressing CDC25B1 entered mitosis even when it was fully retained in the nucleus in the presence of LMB. This observation strongly suggests that only a given population of cells is sensitive to the mitotic inducer effect of the phosphatase. One can suggest that the only cells targeted are those that have reached a late cell cycle window where rate-limiting regulatory partners or substrates are available. As depicted in Fig. 7, we currently have two working hypotheses to explain our observations. The first is that the nuclear export sequence of CDC25B1 is masked or altered when serine 146 is phosphorylated by CDK1-cyclin B. A change in the steric conformation of CDC25B1 would then prevent its interaction with the export machinery and retain it in the nucleus (Fig. 7 A). Phosphorylation-dependent interaction between cyclin D1 and the CRM1 exportin (27Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and between Pho4 and the Msn5 exportin (28Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Neill E.M. Huang L.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 1998; 396: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) have already been reported, suggesting that site-specific phosphorylation events could either positively or negatively regulate nuclear export. In the case of CDC25B1, phosphorylation of serine 146 would prevent the interaction between the nuclear export signal that is located within the first 40 residues and CRM1. Alternatively, phosphorylation of serine 146 may induce an interaction between CDC25B1 and an associated protein (Fig. 7 B). This interaction would be required for the phosphatase to remain within the nucleus and would be essential to perform its function as demonstrated by the observation that the nuclear retention of S146G-CDC25B1 by LMB is not sufficient to restore its activity. The identity of the protein that putatively associates with CDC25B1 remains to be established. This is the first report of a regulatory mechanism that is specific for one of the three CDC25B splice variants. Although the exact function of these variants in cell cycle control remains to be elucidated, one can speculate that specific phosphorylation events may regulate the interactions with partners, modulate the subcellular localization, and therefore have important implications for the regulation of CDC25B activity. Whether these specific properties are involved in the oncogenic properties of CDC25B remains to be investigated. However, since an association with CDC25B2 overexpression has been reported in several types of tumors (29Hernandez S. Hernandez L. Bea S. Pinyol M. Nayach I. Bellosillo B. Nadal A. Ferrer A. Fernandez P.L. Montserrat E. Cardesa A. Campo E. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 89: 148-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Takemasa I. Yamamoto H. Sekimoto M. Ohue M. Noura S. Miyake Y. Matsumoto T.

Baldin, unpublished results. it is tempting to speculate that the alteration of CDC25B variant-specific properties participates in such a process. We gratefully acknowledge M.

Though PhLP has been shown to bind Gβγ in vitro, little is known about its physiological function. In the present study, the effect of PhLP on angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling was measured in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the type 1 Ang II receptor and various amounts of PhLP. Up to 3.6-fold overexpression of PhLP had no effect on Ang II-stimulated inositol trisphosphate (IP3) formation, whereas further increases caused an abrupt decrease in IP3 production with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 6-fold PhLP overexpression. This threshold level for inhibition corresponds to the cellular concentration of cytosolic chaperonin complex, a recently described binding partner that preferentially binds PhLP over Gβγ. Results of pertussis toxin sensitivity, GTPγS binding, and immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that PhLP inhibits phospholipase Cβ activation by dual mechanisms: (i) steric blockage of Gβγ activation of PLCβ and (ii) interference with Gβγ-dependent cycling of Gqα by the receptor. These results suggest that G protein signaling may be regulated through controlling the cellular concentration of free PhLP by inducing its expression or by regulating its binding to the chaperonin.

The process is initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the extracellular face of the receptor, resulting in a change in receptor conformation. This causes an interaction between the receptor and a heterotrimeric G protein on the intracellular surface of the membrane, catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit. In its GTP-bound conformation, Gα dissociates from Gβγ and the receptor, allowing both Gα·GTP and Gβγ to interact with effector enzymes or ion channels and thereby regulate their activity. These effectors in turn control second messenger concentrations (cyclic nucleotides, inositol phosphates, lipids, Ca2+, and K+) and kinase cascades that dictate intermediary metabolism, cell growth, and differentiation (1Neer E.J.

As a result, PKA-phosphorylated Pd does not inhibit Gβγ from interacting with Gα (13Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol.

In addition, recent evidence has shown that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylates Pd at multiple sites, resulting in dramatic inhibition of Gβγ binding and induction of an interaction with the phosphoserine-binding protein, 14-3-3 (25Thulin C.D.

Thus, it appears that the activity of Gβγ subunits can be regulated by cellular factors that control the phosphorylation state of Pd. Phosducin-like protein (PhLP), so named for its 41% identity and 65% homology in amino acid sequence to Pcl, was discovered as the product of an ethanol-induced gene in cultured neuronal cells (26Miles M.F.

Willardson B.M. Mol Vis. 1999; 5: 40PubMed Google Scholar). There are other important differences between PhLP and Pd. PhLP has been recently shown to interact in its native state with the cytosolic chaperonin complex (CCT), whereas Pd does not (30McLaughlin J.N. Thulin C.D. Hart S.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G.

PhLP mRNA was found in all tissues examined (26Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thulin, unpublished data. 2C. D. Thulin, unpublished data. Thus, PhLP could be a ubiquitous regulator of G protein signaling pathways, although it could also fulfill other physiological functions. In this report, we examine the ability of PhLP to regulate a G protein pathway by measuring its effects on angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling. Ang II is a peptide hormone that regulates numerous cardiovascular parameters including blood volume, blood pressure, and vascular tone (32Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 639-672PubMed Google Scholar). Ang II controls vascular tone by inducing vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) contraction (33Folkow B. Grimby G. Thulesius O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1958; 44: 255-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) as well as by stimulating VSMC hypertrophy (34Geisterfer A.A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ.

Hypertension. 1989; 13: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Two known GPCRs, designated AT1R and AT2R, mediate the physiological effects of Ang II. Most of these effects are elicited by AT1R, which couples to Gq (36Sasaki K. Yamano Y. Bardhan S. Iwai N. Murray J.J. Hasegawa M. Matsuda Y. Inagami T.

IP3 causes the release of Ca2+from intracellular stores into the cytoplasm. This increase in cytosolic Ca2+ has been shown to activate Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinases that initiate cell growth responses in VSMC (45Sabri A. Govindarajan G. Griffin T.M. Byron K.L. Samarel A.M.

Given its importance in cardiovascular function, identifying physiological regulators of Ang II signaling is significant. This study reports substantial inhibition of Ang II-induced IP3 production when PhLP is moderately overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells harboring AT1R, demonstrating that PhLP can regulate Ang II signaling. CHO cells stably expressing the rat AT1R were prepared previously (49Martin M.M. White C.R., Li, H. Miller P.J. Elton T.S. Regul. Pept. 1995; 60: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CHO/AT1R cells were grown and passaged at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 1 g/liter G418 sulfate (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). Rat PhLP was subcloned from a previous construct in the pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (29Thulin C.D. Howes K. Driscoll C.D. Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol Vis. 1999; 5: 40PubMed Google Scholar) into the pZeoSV(+) vector (Invitrogen) at the BamHI andEcoRV sites. Rat Pd was amplified from a previous construct in the pET15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) (17Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) by PCR with the forward primer 5′-ATG GAA GAA GCC GCA AGC CAA AGC TTA GAG and the reverse primer 5′-TTA CTC GAT ATC TTC ATC TTC CGT GTT GTT CTG CCC and then directly ligated into the pCR3.1 linearized vector from the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The rat Pd S73A variant was created in pCR3.1 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Both Pd constructs were then subcloned from pCR3.1 into pZeoSV(+) at the BamHI and EcoRV sites. The integrity of each construct was confirmed by sequence analysis. CHO/AT1R cell lines expressing PhLP, Pd, and Pd S73A were prepared by transfection with these pZeoSV(+) plasmids using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with 3 μg of DNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE per 35-mm well. Cells were selected for Zeocin resistance in the above media containing 0.5 g/liter Zeocin (Invitrogen). Clonal cell lines expressing various amounts of PhLP, Pd, and PdS73A were identified by immunoblot analyses using antibodies specific to PhLP and Pd (29Thulin C.D. Howes K. Driscoll C.D. Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol Vis. 1999; 5: 40PubMed Google Scholar). CHO/AT1R cells were split equally into 6-well plates and were allowed to recover for a minimum of 24 h at which point they were ∼80% confluent. The cells were serum-starved by washing three times for 5 min with 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubating in 2 ml of serum-free medium for 48–72 h. At this time the cells were nearly confluent. Cells were then stimulated with 1 ml of fresh serum-free medium containing 10−6m Ang II. At the times indicated, cellular reactions were quenched, and membranes were permeabilized with 200 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were harvested by scraping, and the suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. IP3 in the resulting supernatant was extracted and quantified using a [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate radioreceptor assay kit as described by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein concentrations were determined in parallel wells by harvesting cells in 200 μl of 1% SDS and measuring the protein concentration using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). For PTX experiments, cells were pretreated overnight with 100 ng/ml PTX (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in 1.0 ml of serum-free medium prior to Ang II stimulation. Cells were stimulated with 10−8 to 10−6mAng II as indicated. PhLP-expressing CHO/AT1R cell lines were cultured in 6 × 35 mm-well plates to near confluence. Cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in 200 μl of 1% SDS. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent. Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and 10 μg of total protein were loaded onto a 12% SDS gel along with increasing amounts of purified PhLP, Pd (24Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Skiba N.P.

Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked, and then incubated with either an antibody specific to PhLP or Pd (29Thulin C.D. Howes K. Driscoll C.D. Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol Vis. 1999; 5: 40PubMed Google Scholar) or an antibody prepared against the C-terminal 11 residues common to Gβ1–4 (GβSW, Ref.50Murakami T. Simonds W.F. Spiegel A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After secondary antibody incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, the blots were developed using ECL+ (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and bands were quantified using a Storm 860D phosphorimager in chemifluorescence mode (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Curves were generated from each data set, and the amounts of PhLP or Gβ were determined by comparison with the standards. Cellular concentrations of PhLP were calculated using values of 250 pg of protein and 1500 μm3 volume per CHO cell (51Himes V.B. A metabolic study of Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells with Model Development in a Microcarrier Perfusion. University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN1990Google Scholar). The expression of various Gα subunits in CHO/AT1R cells was determined in a similar manner. Membranes from CHO/AT1R cells were prepared as previously described (52Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Avdonin P. Garant M.J. Rodgers B.D. Kole S. Yang H. Levine M.A. Schwindinger W. Bernier M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1132-11340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay. 1.9 μg of membrane protein along with 15 and 30 ng of purified Gqα, G12α, or G13α (a gift from Dr. T. Kozasa, Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois at Chicago) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and subjected to immunoblot analysis using 1:500 dilutions of antisera specific to Gαq/11, Gα12, and Gα13 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were developed as above, and the amounts of Gα were estimated by comparison with the standards. CHO/AT1R cells expressing Pd, PdS73A, or PhLP were grown in four 100-mm dishes to ∼80% confluence and were serum-starved as described for IP3 determinations. Membranes were isolated, and the binding of 125I-labeled [Sar1, Ile8]Ang II was measured at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 4 nm as described previously (53Martin M.M. Willardson B.M. Burton G.F. White C.R. McLaughlin J.N. Bray S.M. Ogilvie Jr., J.W. Elton T.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The data were fit to a simple one-to-one binding equation using the Kaleidagraph graphics program (Synergy Software, Reading PA), and the total number of binding sites per microgram of protein was obtained from the saturation point of the curve fit. To measure the coupling of AT1R to specific Gα subunits, GTPγS co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed following a modification of a previously described method (54DeLapp N.W. McKinzie J.H. Sawyer B.D. Vandergriff A. Falcone J. McClure D. Felder C.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 946-955PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly,membranes from a 100,000 × g centrifugation of a CHO/AT1R cell extract were prepared as previously described (52Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Avdonin P. Garant M.J. Rodgers B.D. Kole S. Yang H. Levine M.A. Schwindinger W. Bernier M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1132-11340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their protein was determined by the BCA assay. Membranes were diluted to a final concentration of 0.125 mg/ml in the presence of 200 pm [35S]GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Activation was initiated by addition of Ang II to a final concentration of 10−8 or 10−6m. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, after which Igepal CA360 detergent (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.27%, and the incubation was continued an additional 30 min. 1 μl of Gαq/11 or Gα12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antiserum was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and samples were incubated an additional 90 min. The beads were washed three times, brought up in 5 ml of scintillation mixture, and [35S]GTPγS in the immunoprecipitate was quantified using a Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation counter (Packard, Meriden, CT). To measure total activation of Gα subunits by AT1R, GTPγS membrane binding experiments were performed. Cells were serum-starved as described for IP3 determinations, washed with PBS, and harvested by scraping cells from the wells in ice-cold 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2. Cells were incubated 15 min on ice in this buffer to allow hypotonic lysis to occur and were further disrupted by repeated trituration through a 23-gauge needle. Cell membranes were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min and were resuspended in Assay Buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). Total membrane protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay. Membrane samples containing 40 μg of protein were suspended in 200 μl of Assay Buffer containing 5 μm GDP and 4.0 nm[35S]GTPγS (5 μCi/ml). Samples were incubated with or without 10−6m Ang II at 37 °C for varying times and then rapidly filtered through GF/B filter paper (prewashed with assay buffer containing 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin) using the Brandel cell harvester. The filters were then washed three times with Assay Buffer, and the protein-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the filters. The Ang II-induced component of GTPγS binding was determined by subtraction of the GTPγS bound in the absence of Ang II from that bound in the presence of Ang II and was between 40 and 50% of the total binding. The number of moles of GTPγS bound was calculated from the Ang II-induced cpm-bound by correcting for the efficiency of scintillation counting of [35S]GTPγS on the filters and converting the resulting dpm-bound to moles-bound using the specific activity of the [35S]GTPγS. The total Gβγ in these membrane preparations was determined as described above for whole cell extracts. Samples containing 0.4–1.6 μg of total membrane protein or 40–160 fmol of purified Gβ1γ1 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The resulting ECL bands were quantified, and the amount of Gβ in the membrane preparation was determined by comparing the ECL signal with those of the Gβ1γ1standards. CHO/AT1R cell lines were cultured in 35-mm plates to near confluence. 1 μg of PhLP or LacZ fused to a 3′ c-Myc-His6 tag in the pcDNA3.1 vector was transiently transfected into cells using the LipofectAMINE reagent according the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were allowed to recover for 48 h after which they were rinsed twice with PBS and harvested in 200 μl of PBS containing 2% Igepal detergent (Sigma), 600 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 8 μm E64 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were triturated with a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 5 μl of affinity-purified anti-c-Myc antibody (BioMol, 0.7 mg/ml) was added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. 20 μl of a 50% protein A/G-agarose slurry (Promega, Madison, WI) was then added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 1 min, and the beads were washed three times with PBS containing 2% Igepal CA-360. Beads were brought up in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated at 90 °C for 5 min. 7 μl of each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Dilutions of primary antibodies were as follows: anti-PhLP (29Thulin C.D. Howes K. Driscoll C.D. Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol Vis. 1999; 5: 40PubMed Google Scholar), 1:50,000; anti-Gβ1, 1:10,000 (antiserum to residues 1–14, Ref.55Pronin A.N. Gautam N.

Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P. Cell. 1993; 73: 469-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies the full-length sequence of the encoded polypeptide was identified (5Barton C.H. White J.K. Roach T.I.A. Blackwell J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1683-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mouse strains resistant to infection encode Gly at codon 169 within Nramp1 whereas susceptible mice encode Asp (6Malo D. Vogan K. Vidal S., Hu, J. Cellier M. Schurr E. Fuks A. Bumstead N. Morgan K. Gros P. Genomics. 1994; 23: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The G169D polymorphism is sufficient to explain the outcomes of model infections within inbred mouse strains at pre-T cell stages of infection, as confirmed by gene targeting and transgenesis experiments (7Vidal S. Tremblay M.L. Govoni G. Gauthier S. Sebastiani G. Malo D. Skamene E. Olivier M. Jothy S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 8Govoni G. Vidal S. Gauthier S. Skamene E. Malo D. Gros P. Infect. Immun. 1994; 64: 2923-2929Crossref Google Scholar). Allele D169is phenotypically null (7Vidal S. Tremblay M.L. Govoni G. Gauthier S. Sebastiani G. Malo D. Skamene E. Olivier M. Jothy S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). When Nramp1 was cloned, the biochemical basis for its control over the proliferation of intracellular pathogens was not obvious, but the sequence suggested a transporter function (4Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P. Cell. 1993; 73: 469-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed the encoded polytopic integral membrane Nramp1 protein was expressed in a perinuclear location, on intracellular late endosomal/lysosomal membranes (9Atkinson P.G. Blackwell J.M. Barton C.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10Gruenheid S. Pinner E. Desjardins M. Gros P. J. Exp.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nramp1 underwent rapid recruitment to the periphery of a pathogen-containing vesicle (10Gruenheid S. Pinner E. Desjardins M. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 11Searle S. Bright N.A. Roach T.I.A. Atkinson P.G. Barton C.H. Meloen R.H. Blackwell J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and displayed a more peripheral location in response to treatment with interferon-γ (11Searle S. Bright N.A. Roach T.I.A. Atkinson P.G. Barton C.H. Meloen R.H. Blackwell J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led to the suggestion that growth control of microbial pathogens could be achieved by the transport of some toxin into the lumen of the phagosome or by the sequestration of some essential nutrient. The identity of a candidate transport substrate was revealed from studies on a highly sequence-related gene,Nramp2 (DMT1/DCT1/SLC11A2).Nramp2 was initially isolated as an orphan gene (12Gruenheid S. Cellier M. Vidal S. Gros P. Genomics. 1995; 25: 514-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) but was re-isolated by functional cloning through a divalent cation/iron uptake assay (13Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). In addition, identical mutations, G185R, withinNramp2 in the mk mouse and the Belgrade rat are associated with impaired intestinal and erythroid cell iron uptake (14Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C., Su, M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Based on the striking sequence similarity between the two polypeptides (15Cellier M. Prive G. Belouchi A. Kwan T. Rodrigues V. Chia W. Gros P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10089-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), Nramp1 was also predicted to transport divalent cations or iron within murine macrophages, and infection susceptibility occurs through impaired divalent cation transport.The many pleiotropic effects attributed to Nramp1 (16Blackwell J.M. Searle S. Goswami T. Miller E.N. Microbes. Infect. 2000; 2: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) should be explained by differential cation transport. Because Nramp1 protein is expressed within internal membranes, the differential partitioning of divalent cations between the cytosol and the lumen of the internal vesicle should contribute to the pleiotropic effects described (16Blackwell J.M. Searle S. Goswami T. Miller E.N. Microbes. Infect. 2000; 2: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNos) is expressed at quantitatively higher levels in functional-Nramp1 macrophages (17Barrera L.F. Kramnik I. Skamene E. Radzioch D. Immunology. 1994; 82: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar, 18Barton C.H. Whitehead S.H. Blackwell J.M. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 267-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Formica S. Roach T.I. Blackwell J.M. Immunology. 1994; 82: 42-50PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ables G.P. Takamatsu D. Noma H., El- Shazly S. Jin J.K. Taniguchi T. Sekikawa K. Watanabe T. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ferrous iron provides the link between iNos expression andNramp1, because Dlaska and Weiss (21Dlaska M. Weiss G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6171-6177PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that iron loading inhibits iNos expression via the NF-IL6 transcription factor. Enhanced iNos expression inNramp1 functional strains could be explained by depletion of iron availability within the cell cytosol that is sensed by transcription factors such as NF-IL6. However, there is controversy surrounding the direction of Nramp1-mediated cation transport. Some experimental evidence supports cation/ferrous iron influx, into the vesicle lumen, as measured by direct transport of cations (22Kuhn D.E. Baker B.D. Lafuse W.P. Zwilling B.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and analysis of Nramp1 transport activity in Xenopus oocytes (23Goswami T. Bhattacharjee A. Babal P. Searle S. Moores E., Li, M. Blackwell J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 511-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Other data support transport out of the intracellular vesicle lumen (24Jabado N. Kankowski A. Dougaparsad S. Picard V. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 25Gomes M.S. Appelberg R. Immunology. 1998; 95: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Divalent cations were proposed to accumulate or transit the cytosol, but these were not assayed directly (24Jabado N. Kankowski A. Dougaparsad S. Picard V. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Based on the two transport hypotheses; Nramp1-mediated antimicrobial mechanisms have been suggested as redox-mediated killing (22Kuhn D.E. Baker B.D. Lafuse W.P. Zwilling B.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Goswami T. Bhattacharjee A. Babal P. Searle S. Moores E., Li, M. Blackwell J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 511-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) or iron starvation (24Jabado N. Kankowski A. Dougaparsad S. Picard V. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 25Gomes M.S. Appelberg R. Immunology. 1998; 95: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Additionally, Nramp1 not only depletes iron from the cytoplasm but also is proposed to operate in a pathway ultimately leading to iron secretion from the macrophage (26Biggs T.E Baker S.T. Botham M.S. Barton C.H. Perry V.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2060-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Mulero V. Searle S. Blackwell J.M. Brock J.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). New approaches to delineate Nramp1 function are therefore required to resolve the controversy of transport and antimicrobial mechanisms.We reported that transfectants of the Nramp1D169RAW264.7 cell, expressing the functional Nramp1G169allele, constitutively exhibit lower redox-active cytoplasmic iron levels relative to control transfectants or parental cells (28Baker S.T. Barton C.H. Biggs T.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In these cells iron-regulated processes are affected, including IRP2 activity and the iron-regulated protein kinase C isoform, protein kinase Cβ1 (28Baker S.T. Barton C.H. Biggs T.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The changes are supportive with Nramp1 limiting cytoplasmic iron availability and transport into the vesicle lumen. Cytoplasmic iron depletion may be important for maintaining macrophage function during inflammation when high levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates are generated and to minimize the effects of oxidative stress on cell viability (29Epsztejn S. Glickstein H. Picard V. Slotki I.N. Breuer W. Beaumont C. Cabantchik Z.I. Blood. 1999; 94: 3593-3603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2C. H. Barton and S. T. Baker, unpublished. 2C. H. Barton and S. T. Baker, unpublished. Cytosolic iron depletion could explain the elevated expression of iNos inNramp1 functional cells (17Barrera L.F. Kramnik I. Skamene E. Radzioch D. Immunology. 1994; 82: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar, 18Barton C.H. Whitehead S.H. Blackwell J.M. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 267-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Formica S. Roach T.I. Blackwell J.M.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Links between the c-Myc family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and iron homoeostasis have recently been reported (30Wu K.-J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A role for c-Myc was described in elevating cytoplasmic iron for cell proliferation, with stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the expression of genes that either increase or decrease, respectively, the extent of the LIP. Further data in support of a link between c-Myc and iron have been provided by the expression cloning, in a ferrous transport-defective yeast strain, of a novel complementing maize myc transcription factor (31Loulergue C. Lebrun M. Briat J.-F. Gene. 1998; 225: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Kyriakou and colleagues (32Kyriakou D. Eliopoulos A.G. Papadakis A. Alexandrakis M. Eliopoulos G.D. Eur. J. Haematol. 1998; 60: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have described iron-dependent growth of peripheral blood mononuclear cells mediated via c-Myc. We therefore sought to investigate a role for c-Myc in the control of Nramp1. Our results indicate that c-Myc represses Nramp1 expression by acting at the Inr that spans the transcriptional initiation site (33Govoni G. Vidal S. Cellier M. Lepage P. Malo D. Gros P. Genomics. 1995; 27: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Miz-1 (34Peukert K. Staller P. Schneider A. Carmichael G. Hanel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) positively regulates Nramp1 expression, and in co-transfection experiments Miz-1 overcomes the inhibitory effects of c-Myc. The data provide an independent method that lends further support to the hypothesis that Nramp1 reduces the iron pool within the cytoplasm and therefore functions as a proton divalent cation antiporter (23Goswami T. Bhattacharjee A. Babal P. Searle S. Moores E., Li, M. Blackwell J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 511-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this report we present functional data on the murineNramp1 promoter and show inhibition of Nramp1expression during cell growth. We show that ectopic Nramp1expression can reduce cell proliferation. Together these data are supportive for a link between Nramp1-dependent iron homoeostasis and transcription factors associated with cell growth. A recent paper by Wu and colleagues (30Wu K.-J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) showed c-Myc regulates the expression of genes that modulate the extent of iron within the labile iron pool (30Wu K.-J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), specifically that c-Myc enhances the LIP for cell proliferation. These data led us to investigate the murineNramp1 promoter for regulation by c-Myc. In the extended murine Nramp1 promoter sequence presented, we identified six c-Myc-Max binding, E-box sites (35Quandt K. Frech K. Karaas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar).3 However, although we observed DNA protein complexes binding to site 5 (data not shown), these do not appear important for the inhibitory effects of c-Myc onNramp1 expression, and a c-Myc site 5 mutant did not show any altered transcriptional responses (data not shown). However, deletion of c-Myc-Max site 6, and its flanking region, does correlate with an increase in promoter activity and increased responsiveness to Miz-1 transactivation, particularly at low Miz-1 doses. Peukert and colleagues (34Peukert K. Staller P. Schneider A. Carmichael G. Hanel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) showed induction of the AdML and cyclin D promoters by Miz-1, and the cyclin D construct containing a number of E box sites was induced to a lesser extent, suggesting that the presence of E box sites within the promoter can interfere with the ability of Miz-1 to transactivate. This hypothesis is consistent with the increase in Nramp1 promoter activity we observed on deleting from −868 to −71 bp, including E box site #6, but we cannot rule out roles for other factor binding sites. However, the smallest construct we tested was still sensitive to c-Myc inhibition, indicating that E box site #6 is not of primary importance for c-Myc repression. This deletion construct contained two Inrs, a target for c-Myc repression. The Inr has been described as a core promoter element that can replace the TATA box in TATA-less promoters (43Smale S.T. Jain A. Kaufmann J. Emami K.H., Lo, K. Garraway I.P. Cold Spring. Harbor Sym. 1998; LXIII: 21-31Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Gene repression for generating the transformed phenotype has been shown to be of equal importance as gene-inductive events (44Claassen G.F. Hann S.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and some, but not all, c-Myc gene repression is mediated through the Inr.We have not undertaken a more detailed analysis of the −868 and −71 bp region and the associated negative regulatory element, but it does harbor the polymorphic microsatellite element described here, and by others in the human NRAMP1 promoter (39Searle S. Blackwell J.M. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 36: 295-299PubMed Google Scholar). In studies on the human promoter, the polymorphic repeat was suggested to function as an enhancer element and alleles driving high expression protect against infectious but, conversely, promote susceptibility to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (39Searle S. Blackwell J.M. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 36: 295-299PubMed Google Scholar, 40Blackwell J.M. Barton C.H. White J.K. Searle S. Baker A.-M. Williams H. Shaw M.-A. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 194-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have also indicated that promoter polymorphism contributes to susceptibility to Crohn's disease, including the identification of a novel allele (41Kojima Y. Kinouchi Y. Takahashi S. Negoro K. Hiwatashi N. Shimosegawa T. Tiss. Antig. 2001; 58: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the results of this study do not contradict the work in human, we favor the model of a negative-acting element being located within the region of the promoter where the GT element is located. This is based on the enhancement of promoter activity we see when this region is deleted. We propose that the repressor, between −868 and −71 bp in the C57Bl/6 strain is attenuated. The proposed attenuation contributes to stronger promoter activity. We have no evidence for or against the repressor being attributed directly to the microsatellite itself, but suggest that the altered spatial (2.04 nm) and angular separation (216o) of factor binding sites on either side of the repeat element may be sufficient to change potential protein-protein interactions and consequently the activity of the putative repressor. Our current experiments are directed at identifying the nature of the potential repressor element by further deletion mutagenesis. Both promoter alleles are subject to the same level of repression by c-Myc, consistent with c-Myc operating downstream of the polymorphic site at the initiator, and promoter activities of the two allelic variants of c-Myc-repressed Nramp1 are not significantly different.In human, NRAMP1 alleles with low promoter activity associate with protection against autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis. However, a major driving force for keeping the high activity promoter in the gene pool is to provide protection against infectious disease (16Blackwell J.M. Searle S. Goswami T. Miller E.N. Microbes. Infect. 2000; 2: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The major genetic determinant that contributes to infectious disease susceptibility in mouse is the G169D polymorphism (6Malo D. Vogan K. Vidal S., Hu, J. Cellier M. Schurr E. Fuks A. Bumstead N. Morgan K. Gros P. Genomics. 1994; 23: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and this polymorphism has not been described in human. We do not propose that the mouse promoter polymorphism identified will dominate the G169D mutation, because the D169 allele is null. However, potential promoter sequence variation within G169 strains could lead to differential iron homoeostasis and contribute to a phenotype that may be a better model of human infectious, or autoimmune disease susceptibility, than the G169D polymorphism. The search is now on to identify the higher activity promoter variant on the background of the G169 allele or to construct the more active promoter allele in combination with the G169 allele in transgenic mice. Such studies will allow a phenotype of differentialNramp1 expression to be examined in a model organism.As indicated in the introduction there is controversy regarding the direction of cation transport mediated by Nramp1 (22Kuhn D.E. Baker B.D. Lafuse W.P. Zwilling B.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Goswami T. Bhattacharjee A. Babal P. Searle S. Moores E., Li, M. Blackwell J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 511-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Jabado N. Kankowski A. Dougaparsad S. Picard V. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 25Gomes M.S. Appelberg R. Immunology. 1998; 95: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is probably due to the experimental approaches used by different groups. However, the results of this present study provide another independent description for the direction of cation flux mediated byNramp1. Our current data agree with our previous results (28Baker S.T. Barton C.H. Biggs T.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that Nramp1 depletes the cytosol of divalent cations, thus Nramp1 must operate as a proton divalent cation antiporter (23Goswami T. Bhattacharjee A. Babal P. Searle S. Moores E., Li, M. Blackwell J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 511-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), in contrast to Nramp2 that encodes a proton divalent cation symporter (13Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). This finding is remarkable given the high degree of sequence identity within the hydrophobic cores of the two molecules (15Cellier M. Prive G. Belouchi A. Kwan T. Rodrigues V. Chia W. Gros P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10089-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Our evidence is based on the observation that c-Myc antagonizes Nramp1 and on the data of Wu et al.(30Wu K.-J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), indicating that c-Myc enhances the cation pool within the cytoplasm for cell proliferation, including enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase. If Nramp1 were to enhance levels of iron within the cytosol and operate as a symporter, as suggested (24Jabado N. Kankowski A. Dougaparsad S. Picard V. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 25Gomes M.S. Appelberg R. Immunology. 1998; 95: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), then we would anticipate that c-Myc would positively regulateNramp1 expression and ectopic Nramp1 expression would increase rather than reduce cellular growth rates, as we described. These current data are in contrast to those of Jabado (24Jabado N. Kankowski A. Dougaparsad S. Picard V. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), who, using a fluorescent reporter linked to particulate yeast, zymosan, showed Nramp1-dependent extrusion of vesicular divalent cations, and of the hypothesis reached by Gomes and Appelberg (25Gomes M.S. Appelberg R. Immunology. 1998; 95: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that Nramp1 must deprive cations from intracellular pathogens. Preliminary experiments we have undertaken revealed that zymosan itself has a major effect on the distribution of divalent cations within a macrophage and support our and others collective hypothesis of an iron secretory role for Nramp1 (26Biggs T.E Baker S.T. Botham M.S. Barton C.H. Perry V.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2060-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,27Mulero V. Searle S. Blackwell J.M. Brock J.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An iron secretory role for Nramp1 could rationalize data onNramp1 function, both influx into the vesicular lumen and deprivation from pathogens of essential iron for intracellular growth.Our model (Fig. 8) is supportive of an interaction between c-Myc (cellular growth) and Nramp1 and iron. Expression of Nramp1 from a heterologous expression plasmid disrupts this normal regulatory control allowing effects of ectopic Nramp1 expression on growth to be established. We do not believe this arises from Nramp1 overexpression, because levels of protein in the cell lines and primary macrophages are comparable and dilute in parallel (not shown). These current data and those of others indicate that c-Myc must be able to sense levels of iron within a cell by some ill-defined mechanism. In experiments described by others on Miz-1, links with TGFβ signaling pathways and co-activator proteins have been identified (45Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 46Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This is of interest given that recent studies by Roig and colleagues (47Roig E.A. Richer E. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gros P.

To extend our understanding of these interactions, we characterized properties of ALF, a germ cell-specific TFIIA-like factor. ALF was able to stabilize the binding of TBP to DNA, but it could not stabilize TBP mutants A184E, N189E, E191R, and R205E nor could it facilitate binding of the TBP-like factor TRF2/TLF to a consensus TATA element. However, phosphorylation of ALF with casein kinase II resulted in the partial restoration of complex formation using mutant TBPs. Studies of ALF-TBP complexes formed on the Adenovirus Major Late (AdML) promoter revealed protection of the TATA box and upstream sequences from −38 to −20 (top strand) and −40 to −22 (bottom strand). The half-life and apparentKD of this complex was determined to be 650 min and 4.8 ± 2.7 nm, respectively. The presence of ALF or TFIIA did not significantly alter the ability of TBP to bind TATA elements from several testis-specific genes. Finally, analysis of the distinct, nonhomologous internal regions of ALF and TFIIAα/β using circular dichroism spectroscopy provided the first evidence to suggest that these domains are unordered, a result consistent with other genetic and biochemical properties. Overall, the results show that while the sequence and regulation of the ALF gene are distinct from its somatic cell counterpart TFIIAα/β, the TFIIAγ-dependent interactions of these factors with TBP are nearly indistinguishable in vitro. Thus, a role for ALF in the assembly and stabilization of initiation complexes in germ cells is likely to be similar or identical to the role of TFIIA in somatic cells.

An additional factor, TFIIA, interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to stabilize binding to core promoter DNA so that a transcriptionally active preinitiation complex (PIC) can be formed.TFIIA consists of large (e.g. yeast TOA1,Drosophila TFIIA-L, human TFIIAα/β) and small (e.g. yeast TOA2, Drosophila TFIIA-S, human TFIIAγ) subunits, which form a two-domain, boot-shaped structure (3Geiger J.H.

Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains of TOA1 and TOA2 form a six-stranded β-barrel that lies parallel to promoter DNA. Residues at the end of the barrel contact the first direct repeat of the saddle-shaped TBP protein. The N-terminal domains of TOA1 and TOA2 form an α-helical bundle that extends at a right angle away from DNA. Mutations in this domain affect viability in yeast, although its function is not known (5Kang J.J. Auble D.T. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus (also referred to as region I) and C terminus (region IV) of the large subunit are separated by a nonconserved spacer (region II) whose structure is unknown and which is not required for activity (5Kang J.J. Auble D.T. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in higher eukaryotes the large subunit is post-translationally cleaved into two separate subunits (α and β) at a site that is probably close to the junction between region II and an adjacent acidic domain (region III) (6DeJong J.

A factor related to TFIIAα/β, called ALF (TFIIAτ), is expressed only in male germ cells (10Han S.Y. Zhou L. Upadhyaya A. Lee S.H. Parker K.L. DeJong J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) has added a new layer of complexity to the mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation.Gene regulation in male germ cells is characterized by several unusual features (20Hecht N.B. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 21Eddy E.M. O'Brien D.A. Curr. Topics Dev. Biol. 1998; 37: 141-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Kleene K.C.

For instance, the core promoter regions of many germ cell-specific genes are GC-rich, and sequences of 100 bp or less are sufficient for germ cell-specific expression and somatic cell-silencing in transgenic mice. In addition, transcription can initiate at sites that are not normally used in somatic cells, resulting in multiple transcripts with unique 5′-untranslated regions. For example, the mousetbp gene initiates from at least six different sites within ∼4 kb, only one of which is used in somatic cells (23Schmidt E.E. Ohbayashi T. Makino Y. Tamura T Schibler U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5326-5334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), while theACE gene initiates within the twelfth intron (24Howard T. Shai S.Y. Langford K.G. Martin B.M. Bernstein K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4294-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These phenomena may be related to the fact that germ cells display elevated expression of GTFs and GTF-like factors such as ALF and TRF2/TLF (10Han S.Y. Zhou L. Upadhyaya A. Lee S.H. Parker K.L. DeJong J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,25Schmidt E.E. Schibler U. Development. 1995; 121: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Persengiev S.P. Robert S. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrin. 1996; 10: 742-747PubMed Google Scholar) that are involved in PIC assembly. Interestingly, TRF2/TLF is unable to recognize canonical TATA elements, and its specificity for core promoter DNA is uncertain (14Ohbayashi T. Kishimoto T. Makino Y. Shimada M. Nakadai T. Aoki T. Kawata T. Niwa S. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Rabenstein M.D. Zhou S. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7610-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, new patterns of gene expression in male germ cells may be related to changes in chromatin structure that occur during meiosis and spermatogenesis as these may influence accessibility of DNA to the transcription factor machinery (27Lambert W.C. Lambert M.W. Schwartz L.M. Azar M.M. Advanced Cell Biology. Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., New York1981: 1077-1104Google Scholar).Here we have used both qualitative and quantitative analyses to describe the interactions between the germ cell-specific factor ALF with TBP and promoter DNA because this interplay is central to the function of the corresponding somatic cell factor, TFIIA. Among the questions considered are whether ALF interacts with residues in the first repeat of TBP and extends upstream protection of promoter DNA, whether phosphorylation of ALF affects its activity, and whether the interactions among ALF, TBP, and DNA are of comparable affinity and stability as those among TFIIA, TBP, and DNA. In addition, we have used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to predict that the nonhomologous internal region of ALF and TFIIAα/β are mostly unordered. Overall, the results demonstrate that ALF interacts with the TFIIAγ subunit to form a heterodimeric complex that is biochemically and structurally similar to its somatic cell counterpart. These results and the implications for germ cell-specific gene expression are discussed.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we describe experiments aimed at understanding how the properties of the germ cell-specific factor ALF compare with its somatic counterpart TFIIA. In particular, we have examined interactions with TBP and the ability to stabilize binding of TBP to DNA.Properties of ALF and TFIIAThe studies here suggest that TFIIAγ probably serves as a common subunit for the formation of ALF and TFIIA heterodimers. This conclusion is based on a search of what is assumed to be an essentially complete human genome sequence data base, the apparent inability of three TFIIAγ-like sequences identified in that search to produce functional polypeptides, and the detection of a single TFIIAγ transcript in multiple tissues including testis (11Upadhyaya A. Lee S.H. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18040-18048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This is a potentially important result as it suggests the amount of ALF formed might involve a competition with TFIIAα/β for the small subunit. The existence of a single TFIIAγ also places a limit on possible biochemical distinctions of the tissue-specific ALF complex, since important contacts with TBP are made by the small subunit (e.g. residues 66–73 of TOA2) (3Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 4Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).Nevertheless, ALF and TFIIAα/β also possess characteristics that may contribute to these interactions and to other functional properties. For instance, the N- and C-terminal domains are not identical (82 and 88% similar, respectively) and at least two residues in the C terminus interact with TBP (3Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 4Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The acidic stretch located just before the first β-strand of the large subunit may interact with helix 2 of TBP atop the saddle (4Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 5Kang J.J. Auble D.T. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lee D.K.

Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This region is less acidic in ALF than it is in TFIIAα/β. Interactions also occur between positively charged residues within the large subunit and the phosphodiester backbone of promoter DNA (3Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 4Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Finally, the large subunit is a target for phosphorylation, a modification that can partially restore TBP interactions using mutant TBP (Fig. 4,D and E) or mutant TFIIAγ proteins (29Solow S. Salunek M. Ryan R. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15886-15892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Our studies show that ALF exhibits properties that are consistent with those reported here and elsewhere on TFIIA. First, ALF-TFIIAγ and TFIIAα/β-TFIIAγ heterodimers can be modeled into three-dimensional structures that are similar to the yeast TFIIA crystal structure (Fig. 2). Second, ALF- and TFIIA-dependent complexes produce nearly identical patterns of DNase I protection and enhanced cleavage sites (Fig. 5). The results closely match those showing that TFIIA extends the area protected by TBP to include the sequence upstream of the TATA box (49Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 50Maldonado E., Ha, I. Cortes P. Weis L. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6335-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Third, ALF-TBP and TFIIA-TBP complexes were shown to have half-lives (t½) of 650 and 770 min, respectively (Fig. 8). These values are lower but comparable with those observed with recombinant or native TFIIA-containing complexes formed on a 13-base pair AdML TATA oligonucleotide (51Weideman C.A. Netter R.C. Benjamin L.R. McAllister J.J. Schmiedekamp L.A. Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Third, the apparentKD for the ALF-TBP-DNA complex was 4.8 ± 2.7 nm, and for the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex it was 5.5 ± 2.6 nm (Fig. 6). Both values are similar to the previously reported KD of 6 ± 2 nm for the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex determined by DNase I footprinting (37Imbalzano A.N. Zaret K.S. Kingston R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8280-8286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These similarities might be due in part to the fact that ALF contains a sequence of eight amino acids (HRSKNKWK) identical to those in TFIIAα/β which interacts with the DNA backbone (3Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 4Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The one distinction observed in our bandshift assays is that ALF-TBP-DNA complexes migrate more rapidly than TFIIA-TBP-DNA complexes (Fig.3B), suggesting differences in surface charge or conformation reverse the mobility expected based on size.The results suggest that the ability to interact with TBP and stabilize the TBP-DNA interaction is a conserved and perhaps interchangeable function of ALF and TFIIA and raise the possibility that ALF substitutes for TFIIA in male germ cells. A precedent for such a notion comes from the observation that the autosomal PGK-2 gene is up-regulated in male germ cells to compensate for meiotic silencing of the X-linked PGK-1 gene (52McCarrey J.R. Thomas K. Nature. 1987; 326: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, this model may not apply in the case of ALF and TFIIA, as both genes are autosomal (chromosomes 2 and 14, respectively) and both are up-regulated in male germ cells (10Han S.Y. Zhou L. Upadhyaya A. Lee S.H. Parker K.L. DeJong J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, if ALF does replace TFIIAα/β in germ cells, it might involve translational control rather than gene inactivation. Another issue of interest is whether all possible combinations of factors, TFIIA-TBP, TFIIA-TRF2, ALF-TBP, and ALF-TRF2, actually occur in germ cells in vivo and in what proportions.Studies of other somatic- and germ cell-specific isoforms also bear on the relationship between ALF and TFIIAα/β. For instance, inDrosophila the developmentally regulated α85E and germ cell-specific α84B tubulin isoforms are 98% similar, yet ectopic overexpression of α85E to levels of 50% or more in post-mitotic germ cells causes defects in axoneme assembly while being normal for formation of cytoplasmic microtubules and meiotic spindles (53Hutchens J.A. Hoyle H.D. Turner F.R. Raff E.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 481-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Likewise, the testis-specific factor TRF2/TLF and its somatic cell counterpart TBP both interact with TFIIA and TFIIB, but unlike TBP, TRF2/TLF is unable to bind a consensus TATA element (14Ohbayashi T. Kishimoto T. Makino Y. Shimada M. Nakadai T. Aoki T. Kawata T. Niwa S. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Rabenstein M.D. Zhou S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7610-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that somatic and germ cell isoforms, even those that are nearly identical, are not interchangeable. Thus, while our studies show ALF and TFIIA to be similar for interactions with TBP, distinctions could be revealed in genetic or biochemical assays that depend on interactions with TRF2/TLF, formation of a complete PIC, or activator function. In fact, TFIIA is involved in events that occur after PIC assembly even at TATA-less promoters whose initial recognition does not involve TFIIA-TBP complex formation (54Martinez E., Ge, H. Tao Y. Yuan C.X. Palhan V. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6571-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 55Emami K.H. Jain A. Smale S.T.

Carey M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2540-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, one report suggests that ALF is 3-fold less effective than TFIIA in supporting activation in vitro by the Epstein-Barr virus Zta protein (12Ozer J. Moore P.A. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 122-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The extent of the similarities between ALF and TFIIA suggest that gene expression in somatic and germ-line tissues share a similar requirement for stabilization of the PIC and that differences in core promoter recognition and PIC stability are less likely to derive from ability of these factors to directly modulate the specificity of the core promoter factors. Instead, other mechanisms might account for the new patterns of core promoter recognition seen in germ cells. One possibility is that germ cell-specific TFIID complexes composed of ALF, TRF2/TLF, and others play a role promoter selection and PIC stability similar to the role that TFIIA, TBP, and TAFs are proposed to play in somatic cells (although the ability of TRF2/TLF to direct sequence-specific binding is still uncertain). Another possibility is that promoter selection in germ cells involves increased accessibility of the transcription machinery to genomic DNA. In this scenario, PIC assembly still involves ALF- or TFIIA-dependent stabilization of TBP or TRF2/TLF on the core promoter, but new assembly sites are available because of changes in chromatin packaging that occur in meiotic cells.Nonconserved Regions in ALF and TFIIAα/β Are UnorderedA striking characteristic of ALF is that its internal domain is longer and different in amino acid composition compared with that of TFIIAα/β. This region was not analyzed in crystallographic studies of the yeast factor, and its structural make-up has not been previously addressed. The CD data (Fig. 9 and Table I) provide the first evidence to suggest that the internal regions of ALF and TFIIAα/β are unordered, at least in the absence of other proteins with which they might interact. In contrast, the CD spectrum of the full-length protein predicts α-helix, β-sheet, and unordered structures that are consistent with an unordered internal domain and with the α-helical and β-sheet structures predicted from the yeast TFIIA crystal structure and the homology-modeled ALF heterodimer (Fig. 2).The internal domains of TFIIA large subunits display a number of curious properties, some of which are consistent with the notion that this region is unordered. First, the length varies in human ALF (∼287 residues), human TFIIAα/β (∼208 residues), DrosophilaTFIIA-L (∼195 residues), Arabidopsis TFIIA-L (∼189 residues), Caenorhabditis elegans TFIIA-L (∼182 residues), and yeast TOA1 (∼112 residues) and is absent altogether in the large subunit encoded by the microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi (58Katinka M.D. Duprat S. Cornillot E. Metenier G. Thomarat F. Prensier G. Barbe V. Peyretaillade E. Brottier P. Wincker P. Delbac F., El Alaoui H. Peyret P. Saurin W. Gouy M. Weissenbach J. Vivares C.P. Nature. 2001; 414: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Second, homology in this domain only exists in orthologous subunits from closely related species such as mouse and human (10Han S.Y. Zhou L. Upadhyaya A. Lee S.H. Parker K.L. DeJong J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Third, the amino acid sequence is sometimes biased in its composition, as in human TFIIAα/β (25% Gln, 12% Pro),Arabidopsis TFIIA-L (15% Pro), and yeast TOA1 (25% Asn). Fourth, the large subunit is in some species cleaved to form separate α and β subunits. In fact, recombinant α (amino acids 1–274) and β (amino acids 275–376) subunits of human TFIIAα/β separated at QVD↓GT migrate near the position of the purified subunits (7DeJong J. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 3313-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this site is conserved in human ALF (QVDGSGDTSS), human TFIIAα/β (QVDGTGDTSS), zebrafish TFIIAα/β (QVDGAGDTSS), and Drosophila TFIIA-L (QLDGALDSSD) and is less conserved but still present in C. elegans (QLDGGGGGMS), Arabidopsis (QVDGPMPDPY) andSchizosaccharomyces pombe (QIDGTIEDNE). Finally, genetic studies of TOA1 have shown that, except for a complete deletion, mutations in this region have little effect on the ability to support growth. Thus, any role for this domain, including that of a spacer, is predicted here to involve an unordered and perhaps flexible structure.CONCLUSIONIn this report we present a series of in vitroprotein-DNA interaction assays that show that ALF and TFIIA are nearly indistinguishable in their ability to interact with TBP. Overall, the results imply that ALF probably plays a role in the assembly and stabilization of TBP- or TRF2/TLF-dependent complexes in germ cells that is similar or identical to the role played by TFIIA in somatic cells. Transcription of eukaryotic genes in vitro requires RNA polymerase II and a set of general transcription factors (GTFs)1 (TFIIB, -D, -E, -F, and -H) (1Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). An additional factor, TFIIA, interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to stabilize binding to core promoter DNA so that a transcriptionally active preinitiation complex (PIC) can be formed. TFIIA consists of large (e.g. yeast TOA1,Drosophila TFIIA-L, human TFIIAα/β) and small (e.g. yeast TOA2, Drosophila TFIIA-S, human TFIIAγ) subunits, which form a two-domain, boot-shaped structure (3Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar,4Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains of TOA1 and TOA2 form a six-stranded β-barrel that lies parallel to promoter DNA. Residues at the end of the barrel contact the first direct repeat of the saddle-shaped TBP protein. The N-terminal domains of TOA1 and TOA2 form an α-helical bundle that extends at a right angle away from DNA. Mutations in this domain affect viability in yeast, although its function is not known (5Kang J.J. Auble D.T. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus (also referred to as region I) and C terminus (region IV) of the large subunit are separated by a nonconserved spacer (region II) whose structure is unknown and which is not required for activity (5Kang J.J. Auble D.T. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in higher eukaryotes the large subunit is post-translationally cleaved into two separate subunits (α and β) at a site that is probably close to the junction between region II and an adjacent acidic domain (region III) (6DeJong J. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7DeJong J. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, the majority of hormone-responsive genes are not directly regulated by hormone receptors. These genes are termed secondary response genes. To explore the molecular mechanisms by which the steroid hormone estrogen regulates secondary response genes, theovalbumin(Ov) gene was analyzed. Three protein-protein complexes (Chirp-I, -II, -III), which do not contain the estrogen receptor, are induced by estrogen to bind to the 5′-flanking region of the Ov gene. The Chirp-III DNA binding site, which is required for estrogen induction, binds a complex of proteins that contains the estrogen-inducible transcription factor δEF1. Experiments undertaken to identify proteins complexed with δEF1 led to the elucidation of a novel mechanism of action of upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1), which involves its tethering to the Ov gene 5′-flanking region by δEF1. Gel mobility shift assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments identify USF-1 as a component of Chirp-III. However, USF-1 is not able to bind to the Chirp-III site independently. In addition, USF-1 overexpression is able to induce Ov gene promoter activity in transfection experiments. USF-1 can also potentiate the induction of theOv gene by the transcription factor δEF1. Moreover, mutating the δEF1 binding sites in the 5′-flanking region of theOv gene abrogates induction of the gene by USF-1.

In some cases, a primary response gene encodes a transcription factor that is capable of regulating downstream genes, or secondary response genes. In the last decade, uncovering the mechanism of action of the estrogen receptor as a signaling molecule and as a regulator of transcription has been a priority. However, the majority of genes regulated by estrogen are not primary response genes but secondary response genes. To investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of secondary response genes, the induction of the ovalbumin(Ov)1gene by estrogen was analyzed.Ov gene expression is up-regulated 200-fold upon estrogen administration in vivo (6Sanders M.M. McKnight G.S. Malacinski G.M. Molecular Genetics of Mammalian Cells. Macmillan Press, New York1986: 183-216Google Scholar). This is due to a 20-fold increase of transcription of the Ov gene (7Sanders M.M. McKnight G.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6550-6557Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) coupled with a 10-fold increase in mRNA stability (8Arao Y. Miyatake N. Yamamoto E. Usiku H. Matsuura A. Ninomiya Y. Maushige S. Hasegawa T. Kato S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 710-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The Ov gene is classified as a secondary response gene because the estrogen receptor does not directly bind to it and because there is a requirement for concomitant protein synthesis for transcriptional activation (9Swaneck G.E. Nordstrom J.L. Kreuzaler F. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Estrogen induction of the Ov gene requires twocis-acting regulatory elements in the 5′-flanking region (7Sanders M.M. McKnight G.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6550-6557Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the steroid dependentregulatory element (SDRE), which spans from −892 to −793, and the negative regulatoryelement (NRE), which spans from −308 to −88 (Fig.1). Ten-base pair linker scanner mutations or deletion mutations spanning the SDRE abrogateOv gene induction by estrogen (10Dean D.M. Jones P.S. Sanders M.M. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 27-39Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo genomic footprinting has identified three protein-protein complexes that bind to the SDRE upon estrogen administration (10Dean D.M. Jones P.S. Sanders M.M. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 27-39Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These are called the chicken inducibleregulatory proteins-I, -II, and -III (Chirp-I, -II, -III) (for reviews, see Refs. 11Sensenbaugh K.R. Sanders M.M. Pandalai S.G Gene Expression and Nutrition: From Cells to Whole Body. Research Signposts, Trivandrum, India1996: 45-57Google Scholar and 12Dillner N.B. Sanders M.M. Recent Res. Devel. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 93-108Google Scholar). The NRE binds proteins that are positive and/or negative regulators of the Ov gene (13Sensenbaugh K.R. Sanders M.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Chirp-III includes the estrogen-inducible transcription factor δEF1 (14Dillner N.B. Sanders M.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 19: 85-91Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, analysis by in vivo footprinting and gel mobility shift assays (GMSAs) indicates that an additional protein(s) is present in the Chirp-III complex (10Dean D.M. Jones P.S. Sanders M.M. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 27-39Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Based on studies that demonstrate that estrogen induces USF to bind to regulatory regions of genes (15Xing W. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1310-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Ikeda K. Inoue S. Orimo A. Tsutsumi K.-I. Muramatsu M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), experiments were conducted to test whether USF is a component of the Chirp-III complex.USF-1 and USF-2 are ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix proteins (17Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) that were first identified as activators of the adenovirus major late promoter (18Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). USF-1 and USF-2 are capable of homodimerization or heterodimerization and typically bind to E-box DNA sequences (21Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Jarosch U. Graf T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). USF can be recruited to bind E-boxes in the 5′-flanking region of target genes by transcription factors responding to a specific signal (15Xing W. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1310-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,19Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Beraridino W.D. Otten L.A. Mach B.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the USF heterodimer cooperates with Stat1 to bind to and to induce the class II transactivator (CIITA) regulatory region (19Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Beraridino W.D. Otten L.A. Mach B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The USF heterodimer is also recruited to bind to the cathepsin D promoter in an estrogen-dependent manner (15Xing W. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1310-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In these examples, USF functions in a capacity that enhances or amplifies a pre-existing signal rather than directly mediating that signal from the source to a downstream gene.Herein, experiments demonstrate that USF-1 is part of the Chirp-III complex that is required for estrogen induction of the Ovgene. Furthermore, overexpression of USF-1 induces Ov gene transcriptional activity, and activity is potentiated by co-overexpression of USF-1 and δEF1. However, mutating the δEF1 binding sites in the 5′-flanking region of the Ov gene abrogates its induction by USF-1. These data invite us to propose a novel paradigm whereby the ubiquitous transcription factor USF is tethered to the Ov gene by the estrogen-inducible transcription factor δEF1.DISCUSSIONAltogether, these data indicate that the Ov gene is induced via a unique molecular mechanism involving the tethering of USF to DNA by δEF1. GMSA and co-immunoprecipitation experiments clearly demonstrate that USF-1, and probably USF-2, is part of the Chirp-III complex containing δEF1 (Figs. 2 and 3). However, whether the interaction between δEF1 and USF-1 is direct or whether the interaction is mediated by another protein(s) present in the nuclear protein extracts is yet to be determined. Future co-immunoprecipitation experiments with purified proteins should address this issue. Unfortunately, these experiments must await the cloning of the chicken USF-1 and USF-2 homologs. In the meantime, it is tempting to speculate that the interaction involves the δEF1 Pit, Oct, UNC (POU) homeodomain, which is postulated to be a protein-protein interaction domain.The interaction between δEF1 and USF is functionally relevant. Overexpression of USF-1 induces the Ov gene in the absence of estrogen (Fig. 4), presumably through the small but detectable amount of δEF1 in oviduct cells in the absence of estrogen (Fig. 6and 26Kaye J.S. Pratt-Kaye S. Bellard M. Drtzen G. Bellard F. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The observation that USF-1 does not induce Ov gene transcription in the presence of steroids is likely due to endogenous USF. More importantly, Ov gene transcription is potentiated by the combination of overexpressed δEF1 and USF-1 (Fig. 5), further substantiating the concept that they form a functionally relevant complex.Most data indicate that the specificity of gene activation by USF is directed by a binding partner or signaling protein. For example, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) stimulates USF to bind to an E-box in the C/EBPα 5′-flanking region in an autoregulatory circuit (22Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). USF cooperatively binds with Stat1 to contiguous DNA elements to induce the class II transactivator promoter (19Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Beraridino W.D. Otten L.A. Mach B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Interestingly, USF is also targeted to promoters in estrogen signaling cascades. In vivo UV cross-linking has shown estrogen-dependent loading of USF to an E-box in the 5′ regulatory region of the cathepsin D gene (15Xing W. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1310-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). USF is also involved in the regulation of other estrogen-responsive genes such as the chicken vitellogenin II gene (27Seal S.M. Davis D.L. Burch J.B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2704-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the mouse efp gene (16Ikeda K. Inoue S. Orimo A. Tsutsumi K.-I. Muramatsu M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) via binding to E-box sites. The data herein demonstrate that USF contributes to Ov gene activation as well. More importantly, the mechanism of USF induction of the Ov gene apparently does not include a direct interaction with DNA (Fig. 2). Instead, it is dependent on intact δEF1 binding sites (Fig. 7). Furthermore, USF-1 is not regulated by estrogen (Fig. 6). This suggests that the estrogen-inducible transcription factor δEF1 tethers USF to the 5′ regulatory region of the Ov gene. Additionally, this concept is made plausible by the GMSA (Fig. 2) and co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.3) experiments, which demonstrate that USF cannot be competed from the Chirp-III binding site with a USF consensus oligomer and that δEF1 and USF-1 can interact in the presence or absence of DNA. This supports a novel mechanism for steroid hormone signaling whereby USF is recruited to the 5′-flanking region of the Ov gene via tethering to the estrogen-inducible transcription factor δEF1 in the absence of a bona fide USF binding site. These data also extend the emerging paradigm in which the ubiquitous USF transcription factor is recruited by a signal-specific transcription factor to enhance activation of a target gene. Estrogen is a lipophilic molecule that diffuses into cells and binds to the estrogen receptor. The estrogen-estrogen receptor complex then binds to and regulates genes called primary response genes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G.

For example, the USF heterodimer cooperates with Stat1 to bind to and to induce the class II transactivator (CIITA) regulatory region (19Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Beraridino W.D. Otten L.A. Mach B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The USF heterodimer is also recruited to bind to the cathepsin D promoter in an estrogen-dependent manner (15Xing W. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1310-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In these examples, USF functions in a capacity that enhances or amplifies a pre-existing signal rather than directly mediating that signal from the source to a downstream gene. Herein, experiments demonstrate that USF-1 is part of the Chirp-III complex that is required for estrogen induction of the Ovgene. Furthermore, overexpression of USF-1 induces Ov gene transcriptional activity, and activity is potentiated by co-overexpression of USF-1 and δEF1. However, mutating the δEF1 binding sites in the 5′-flanking region of the Ov gene abrogates its induction by USF-1. These data invite us to propose a novel paradigm whereby the ubiquitous transcription factor USF is tethered to the Ov gene by the estrogen-inducible transcription factor δEF1. DISCUSSIONAltogether, these data indicate that the Ov gene is induced via a unique molecular mechanism involving the tethering of USF to DNA by δEF1. GMSA and co-immunoprecipitation experiments clearly demonstrate that USF-1, and probably USF-2, is part of the Chirp-III complex containing δEF1 (Figs. 2 and 3). However, whether the interaction between δEF1 and USF-1 is direct or whether the interaction is mediated by another protein(s) present in the nuclear protein extracts is yet to be determined. Future co-immunoprecipitation experiments with purified proteins should address this issue. Unfortunately, these experiments must await the cloning of the chicken USF-1 and USF-2 homologs. In the meantime, it is tempting to speculate that the interaction involves the δEF1 Pit, Oct, UNC (POU) homeodomain, which is postulated to be a protein-protein interaction domain.The interaction between δEF1 and USF is functionally relevant. Overexpression of USF-1 induces the Ov gene in the absence of estrogen (Fig. 4), presumably through the small but detectable amount of δEF1 in oviduct cells in the absence of estrogen (Fig. 6and 26Kaye J.S. Pratt-Kaye S. Bellard M. Drtzen G. Bellard F. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The observation that USF-1 does not induce Ov gene transcription in the presence of steroids is likely due to endogenous USF. More importantly, Ov gene transcription is potentiated by the combination of overexpressed δEF1 and USF-1 (Fig. 5), further substantiating the concept that they form a functionally relevant complex.Most data indicate that the specificity of gene activation by USF is directed by a binding partner or signaling protein. For example, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) stimulates USF to bind to an E-box in the C/EBPα 5′-flanking region in an autoregulatory circuit (22Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). USF cooperatively binds with Stat1 to contiguous DNA elements to induce the class II transactivator promoter (19Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Beraridino W.D. Otten L.A. Mach B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Interestingly, USF is also targeted to promoters in estrogen signaling cascades. In vivo UV cross-linking has shown estrogen-dependent loading of USF to an E-box in the 5′ regulatory region of the cathepsin D gene (15Xing W. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1310-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). USF is also involved in the regulation of other estrogen-responsive genes such as the chicken vitellogenin II gene (27Seal S.M. Davis D.L. Burch J.B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2704-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the mouse efp gene (16Ikeda K. Inoue S. Orimo A. Tsutsumi K.-I. Muramatsu M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) via binding to E-box sites. The data herein demonstrate that USF contributes to Ov gene activation as well. More importantly, the mechanism of USF induction of the Ov gene apparently does not include a direct interaction with DNA (Fig. 2). Instead, it is dependent on intact δEF1 binding sites (Fig. 7). Furthermore, USF-1 is not regulated by estrogen (Fig. 6). This suggests that the estrogen-inducible transcription factor δEF1 tethers USF to the 5′ regulatory region of the Ov gene. Additionally, this concept is made plausible by the GMSA (Fig. 2) and co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.3) experiments, which demonstrate that USF cannot be competed from the Chirp-III binding site with a USF consensus oligomer and that δEF1 and USF-1 can interact in the presence or absence of DNA. This supports a novel mechanism for steroid hormone signaling whereby USF is recruited to the 5′-flanking region of the Ov gene via tethering to the estrogen-inducible transcription factor δEF1 in the absence of a bona fide USF binding site. These data also extend the emerging paradigm in which the ubiquitous USF transcription factor is recruited by a signal-specific transcription factor to enhance activation of a target gene. Altogether, these data indicate that the Ov gene is induced via a unique molecular mechanism involving the tethering of USF to DNA by δEF1.

https://openalex.org/W2001534369,"Post-translational modification of histones enables dynamic regulation of chromatin structure in eukaryotes. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) modify the N-terminal tails of histones by adding or removing acetyl groups to specific lysine residues. A particular pair of HAT (Esa1) and HDAC (Rpd3) is proposed to modify the same lysine residue in vitro and in vivo. Thus, HAT and HDAC might have similar structural and functional motifs. Here we show that HAT (Esa1 family) and HDAC (Rpd3 family) have similar amino acid stretches in the primary structures through evolution. We refer to this region as the “ER (Esa1-Rpd3) motif.” In the tertiary structure of Esa1, the ER motif is located near the active center. In Rpd3, for which the tertiary structure remains unclear, we demonstrate that the ER motif contains the same secondary structure as found in Esa1 by circular dichroism analysis. We did alanine-scanning mutagenesis and found that the ER motif regions of Esa1 or Rpd3 are required for HAT activity of Esa1 or HDAC activity of Rpd3, respectively. Our discovery of the ER motif present in the pair of enzymes (HAT and HDAC) indicates that HAT and HDAC have common structural bases, although they catalyze the reaction with opposite functions.

The eukaryotic genome is compacted in the nucleus as a highly condensed structure called chromatin. For various reactions on chromosomes to occur, the compacted chromatin structure needs to be altered. Histones are well-conserved nuclear basic proteins and function as cores to package eukaryotic DNA into nucleosomes, which are repeating units of chromatin structure (1Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are components of nucleosome core particles (2Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar), whereas linker histones (e.g. H1) are located outside of core particles (3Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The N-terminal tails of core histones extend to the accessible surface of the nucleosome core particles (2Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar) and are therefore called “N-tails” and are thought to be important for modulation of chromatin structure. After the discovery of histone acetylation (4Allfrey V. Faulkner R.M. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar), numerous studies have indicated that acetylation of specific lysine residues in the N-tails plays an important role in DNA-mediated reactions, including transcriptional regulation (5Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar, 6Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar, 7Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar). Analyses of molecules involved in this modification and relationships between these molecules are necessary to reveal the molecular mechanisms of these reactions. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; ER, Esa1-Rpd3; MYST, MOZ,Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, Tip60; HDLP, HDAC-like protein of hyperthermophilic bacterium. 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; ER, Esa1-Rpd3; MYST, MOZ,Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, Tip60; HDLP, HDAC-like protein of hyperthermophilic bacterium. and histone deacetylase (HDAC) act competitively to bring about a steady state of acetylation of the core histones. In vivo, the deletion of HAT or HDAC causes hypoacetylation or hyperacetylation to core histones, respectively (8Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 9Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In vitro, HAT and HDAC are classified into certain conserved families, and each family acts on particular lysine residues (10Kimura A. Horikoshi M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Kimura A. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12Carmen A.A. Griffin P.R.

In addition, particular pairs of HATs and HDACs are reported to act as “functional pairs” in vivo. Nuclear hormone receptors change their interaction partners from Sin3 complex (HDAC) to p160 family (HAT) in a ligand-dependent manner to activate the target gene from a repressed state (13Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In yeast, Esa1 (HAT) and Rpd3 (HDAC) are reported to function in acetylation and deacetylation, respectively, of lysine 12 of histone H4 at the PHO5 gene promoter (14Vogelauer M., Wu, J. Suka N.

The strong functional linkage between Esa1 and Rpd3 suggests that both enzymes might have a structural similarity, which can serve as structural bases for these enzymes to act on a common lysine residue of histone in common biological processes throughout the eukaryotes. However, previous studies have not found any structural similarity between Esa1 and Rpd3 families (32Yan Y. Barlev N.A. Haley R.H. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Mol.

In this paper, we report the discovery of a conserved amino acid stretch in the primary structures between HAT (Esa1) and HDAC (Rpd3). We refer to this stretch as the “ER (Esa1-Rpd3) motif.” The ER motif resides in the catalytic region responsible for HAT and HDAC activities. Structural and functional analyses revealed that the ER motifs in both enzymes play important roles in the activities of each enzyme. BLAST similarity search against yeast sequences (34Altschul S.F.

Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9395) Google Scholar). All peptides were synthesized by the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan), except histone H4 N-terminal tail peptide, which was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Fig.2 B). The CD spectra were acquired with a Jasco J-820 (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan), using the continuous mode with 1-nm bandwidth, 2-s response, a scan speed of 50 nm/min, and a cuvette with 1-mm path length. All spectra were averaged over at least five scans. The samples were prepared using a solution containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0 at 5 °C), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40% trifluoroethanol, and 20 μm peptide. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was done by the method of Kunkel (38Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used to create Esa1 and Rpd3 mutants are shown in Table I. The correct introduction of the various mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. The yeast ESA1 or RPD3 gene and its derivatives were cloned into pMH524 single-copy vector to express FLAG-tagged version of the proteins under the control ofGAL1 promoter 2A. Kimura and M. Horikoshi, unpublished data. . Whole-cell extracts were prepared from Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303-1a strains expressing the FLAG-Esa1, FLAG-Rpd3, and their mutants by lysing cells with glass beads in extraction buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.3 at 25 °C), 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.72 μg/ml aprotinin). The extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma).

The sequence of each mutant was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Filter binding assays for HAT activity were done essentially as described elsewhere (11Kimura A. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 39Suzuki T. Kimura A. Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Reactions were done at 30 °C for 30 min in 25 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 25 °C), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butylate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) and [3H]acetyl-CoA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), spotted on P81 phosphocellulose filter paper (Whatman), washed with 0.2 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.2 at 25 °C), and then dried and subjected to liquid scintillation. In the reactions, 50 pmol of histone H4 N-tail peptides (SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRC) (Upstate Biotechnology) and ∼1 pmol of Esa1 derivative proteins were used. Histone deacetylase was assayed using a Histone Deacetylase Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One hundred micrograms of histone H4 N-tail peptides were incubated overnight at room temperature with 1.25 mCi of [3H]acetic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 5 μl of BOP solution (0.24 M benzotriazol-1-yloxytris (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate and 0.2 mtriethylamine in acetonitrile), loaded into a Microcon-SCX spin column (Millipore), washed with 10 mm HCl in 10% methanol, and eluted with 3 m HCl in 50% isopropanol. The buffer was removed from the radiolabeled peptides by using a Speed-Vac, and the peptides were then dissolved in 250 μl of distilled water. Reactions were done at 37 °C for 4 h in 200 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 25 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol, and then quenched by the addition of 50 μl of 1m HCl:0.16 m acetic acid in distilled water. Released [3H]acetic acid was extracted with 600 μl of ethyl acetate, and two 200-μl aliquots of each ethyl acetate phase were subjected to liquid scintillation. In the reactions, 20,000 cpm of [3H]acetyl histone H4 N-tail peptides and ∼1 pmol of Rpd3 derivative proteins were used. To identify a common structure between the Esa1 and Rpd3 families, we performed systematic BLAST searches using the entire or partial sequences of Esa1 and Rpd3 families as queries, and found a previously unrecognized, but unequivocal sequence similarity between Esa1 and Rpd3 over 21 amino acids ((R/K)X(W/Y)XX(N/E)X(C/G/A)(L/I/V)(L/A)XXXX(L/V/I)XXXLXY in Fig. 1 A). Nine sites were occupied by identical or similar residues among Esa1 family members (15Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16Smith E.R. Eisen A., Gu, W. Sattah M. Pannuti A. Zhou J. Cook R.G. Lucchesi J.C. Allis C.D. Proc.

Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar) through evolution. We refer to this set of residues as the “ER (Esa1-Rpd3) motif.” To characterize this motif, we examined the structural features of these residues. The central residues of the ER motif are composed of hydrophobic amino acids (i.e. Cys252, Leu253, Leu254, Leu259, Leu264 of Esa1), whereas both ends of the motif are composed of large hydrophilic amino acids (i.e.Arg245, Trp247, Asn250, Tyr266 of Esa1). Because small hydrophobic residues tend to form turns (40Wilmot C.M. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), Cys and Leu residues at the central part of the ER motif might form a turn. This notion is consistent with the tertiary structure of the ER motif in Esa1, because the residues (Leu257 and Leu259) of the ER motif make a turn (Fig. 1, B and C) (32Yan Y. Barlev N.A. Haley R.H. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The corresponding residues of the ER motif in Rpd3 are thus expected to make a similar turn, although the tertiary structure of Rpd3 has still not been clarified. We then examined the positions of the ER motif on the domain structures of Esa1 and Rpd3. The ER motif of Esa1 is located within the MYST (MOZ, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2,Tip60) domain (blue and yellow boxesof Esa1 in Fig. 1 A). Because the MYST domain is responsible for HAT activity (15Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the ER motif in the MYST domain might be involved in HAT activity of Esa1. Because the ER motif is not located within the acetyl-CoA binding site in the MYST domain (purple box of Esa1 in Fig. 1 A) (25Reifsnyder C. Lowell J. Clarke A. Pillus L. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 41Borrow J. Stanton Jr., V.P. Andresen J.M. Becher R. Behm F.G. Chaganti R.S. Civin C.I. Disteche C. Dube I. Frischauf A.M. Horsman D. Mitelman F. Volinia S. Watmore A.E. Housman D.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), it might be involved in processes other than acetyl-CoA binding. The ER motif of Rpd3 is located within the HDAC domain (blue and light green boxes of Rpd3 in Fig. 1 A), indicating that the ER motif might also be involved in HDAC activity in Rpd3. Because the motif is not located at the zinc-binding site in Rpd3 (red box of Rpd3 in Fig. 1 A; the zinc ion functions as a metal cofactor of HDAC activity) (33Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar), it might be involved in processes other than zinc recognition. To estimate the functional role of the ER motif, we mapped the position of the ER motif in the tertiary structure of Esa1–CoA complex (32Yan Y. Barlev N.A. Haley R.H. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). The tertiary structure of the MYST domain of Esa1 is composed mainly of three regions: (i) an N-terminal region (α1,α2, β1–β6 in Fig.1 B) which contains a zinc finger; (ii) a central core region (α3, β7–β9 in Fig.1 B), which contains an acetyl-CoA binding site; and (iii) a C-terminal region (α4- α7, β10,β11 in Fig. 1 B). These three regions form a cleft surrounding the active center (red circle in Fig.1 B). The ER motif is located within the N-terminal region of the MYST domain (blue circle in Fig. 1 B). In addition, the ER motif forms a surface of the cleft that, based on the tertiary structures of other HATs (Gcn5 (42Lin Y. Fletcher C.M. Zhou J. Allis C.D. Wagner G. Nature. 1999; 400: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 43Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Sterner D.E. Venkataramani R.N. Wang L. Zhou J. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nature. 1999; 401: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), Hat1 (45Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar)), is predicted to be important for the catalytic activity of Esa1. The ER motif contains an α-helix (α2: from Arg245 to Lys256) and a loop (from Leu257 to Tyr266) (blue circle in Fig. 1 B). As mentioned above in the preceding subsection, the residues (Leu257 and Leu259) of the ER motif in Esa1 make a turn and the ER motif forms an oval architecture (32Yan Y. Barlev N.A. Haley R.H. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because the start and end points of the ER motif region are closely positioned in the tertiary structure, the ER motif seems to be a structural module in Esa1. The ER motif is located within ∼20 Å of the active center, which is a distance predicted from the tertiary structure of Esa1-CoA (red circle in Fig. 1 B). Such a close proximity suggests that the motif plays an important role in the HAT activity of Esa1 as we speculated in the previous subsection. The tertiary structure of the ER motif in Esa1 (32Yan Y. Barlev N.A. Haley R.H. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) indicates that nine residues of the ER motif are divided into three regions (i.e. ER1, ER2, and ER3) according to structural roles: (i) the residues of ER1 are located on the surface of the cleft and face the active center (Cys252 and Leu259 in Esa1;cyan in Fig. 1 C (Gly 327 and Leu334 in Rpd3)), (ii) the residues of ER2 are buried in a hydrophobic core and maintain the architecture of the cleft surrounding the active center (Trp247, Asn250, Leu253, and Leu254 in Esa1; blue in Fig. 1 C (Trp322, Glu325, Leu328, and Leu329 in Rpd3)), and (iii) the residues of ER3 are located on the surface opposite to the active center (Arg245, Leu264, and Tyr266in Esa1; green in Fig. 1 C (Arg320, Leu338, and Tyr340 in Rpd3)). From their structural positions, the residues of ER1 and ER2 seem to be especially important for the HAT activity of Esa1, whereas those of ER3 do not. A residue of ER2 (Leu254) is reported to be critical for HAT activity of Esa1 in vitro and cell-cycle progressionin vivo (46Clarke A.S. Lowell J.E. Jacobson S.J. Pillus L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2515-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the ER motif of Esa1 is located close to the active center and that the residues of ER1 and ER2 are especially important for the HAT activity of Esa1. Because the tertiary structure of Rpd3 has not yet been clarified, the precise structure and position of the ER motif in Rpd3 are not clear. However, the tertiary structure of HDAC-like protein of hyperthermophilic bacterium (HDLP) has been clarified, which is 37% identical and 55% similar to yeast Rpd3 over 300 residues containing the catalytic core of HDAC activity (33Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). HDLP has a single globular domain structure belonging to the open α/β class of folds (Fig. 1 D). The active center predicted from the binding site of trichostatin A (47Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is the inhibitor of HDAC activity, forms a pocket surrounded by eight repeating units consisting of a β-sheet loop–α-helix (red circle in Fig. 1 D). The zinc ion is near the bottom of the active center (gray sphere in Fig. 1 D). This tertiary structure indicates that HDLP and HDAC cause (i) HDAC reaction through a mechanism of binding the substrate lysine residue by the pocket and (ii) HDAC reaction using the zinc ion as a metal cofactor (33Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). To estimate the position and structure of the ER motif in Rpd3, we aligned the sequence of Rpd3 with that of HDLP (Fig. 1 E). In the alignment, HDLP lacked the region corresponding to the ER motif of Rpd3, and, accordingly, we could not estimate the structure of the ER motif in Rpd3. However, because the region adjacent to the ER motif in Rpd3 corresponds to the region near the binding site of trichostatin A in HDLP, the position of the ER motif in Rpd3 was estimated to be between β8 and α8 (blue circle in Fig. 1 D). Because trichostatin A is known to mimic the substrate (lysine side chain) (33Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P.

We have defined two active peptides from the cloned deduced amino acid sequence. Both peptides inhibit type III but not type I collagen-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that the active binding site of the platelet receptor to type III collagen resides in these portions of the protein.

These results suggest that the active binding site of the platelet receptor to type III collagen resides in these portions of the protein. Ligand-receptor interactions with the subsequent transduction of signals have long been recognized as a major mechanism for regulating cellular activities in eukaryotic cells. This mechanism is also operative when platelets interact with collagen exposed by damage to the endothelial surfaces of vessels. In blood vessels, type I and type III collagens are the major collagen components. Vessels also contain very small amounts of type IV and V collagen and minor amounts of several other types of collagen. After platelets adhere to exposed connective tissue, they aggregate, secrete biologically active substances, and effect hemostasis. Many studies have centered on the role of the integrin and non-integrin collagen receptors in regulating platelet function, and it has been known that platelets possess additional, distinct reactive sites for type I collagen (1Fitzsimmons C.M. Cawston T.E. Barnes M.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1986; 56: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Staatz W.D. Fok K.F. Zutter M.M. Adams S.P. Rodriguez B.A. Santoro S. J. Biol.

J. 1987; 248: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Morton L.F. Peachey A.E. Zijenah L.Z. Goodall A.H. Humphries M.J. Barnes M.J. Biochem.

However, definition of the platelet collagen receptors must be fully established before logical interventions can be identified and used to alter the course of abnormal hemostasis when platelets encounter denuded vascular surfaces. We have cloned and characterized a non-integrin platelet receptor for type I collagen (6Chiang T.M. Rinaldy A. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Expression and characterization of the recombinant protein were accomplished, and the protein was shown to be functionally significant in blocking the interaction between type I collagen and human platelets. We have defined nine amino acid residues (Nona peptide) representing a part of the extracellular domain of the 65-kDa receptor that blocks type I collagen-induced platelet aggregation and the release reaction (7Chiang T.M. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The peptide completely blocks the adhesion of platelets to type I collagen immobilized on micro titer wells and blocks 60% of the adhesion in aortic segments. However, the recombinant protein and the peptide do not affect type III collagen or the ADP-induced platelet aggregation and the release reaction. These results suggest that platelet receptors for type I and type III collagens are different. Determination of the precise receptor for each type of collagen is clearly necessary to understand platelet-collagen interaction. Previously, we have purified and characterized a platelet membrane protein with a molecular mass of 47 kDa that functioned as a receptor for type III collagen in intact platelets. The polyclonal antibody raised against the purified 47-kDa protein also inhibits type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation (8Chiang T.M. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 443-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the protein had not been completely characterized. In the present study, a cDNA encoding the 47-kDa protein has been derived and a recombinant protein has been expressed in a prokaryotic expression vector. We show that the recombinant protein binds to type III collagen in a dose-dependent manner. The recombinant protein inhibits type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we have defined two active peptides that are able to specifically inhibit type III but not type I collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The platelet 47-kDa protein (molecular mass 47 kDa) was purified from isolated human platelet membranes as previously described, and a polyclonal antibody (anti-47-kDa (polyclonal antibody raised against the purified receptor for type III collagen)) was raised. The anti-47-kDa reacts with the recombinant protein in Western blots (8Chiang T.M. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 443-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have also determined the amino terminus sequence of the 47-kDa platelet protein so that a degenerate oligonucleotide could be designed. We used the degenerate oligonucleotide and poly(dT)12·(dG) to screen a human bone marrow cDNA library. The cDNA fragment (1.2-kb) was ligated into a pBad TOPO prokaryotic expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), heat-shocked into competent Escherichia coli, and grown on liquid broth (LB) 1The abbreviations used are: LB, liquid broth; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; FLUOS, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester; r47, 47-kDa recombinant protein. agar plates.

The supernatant was subjected to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column or an affinity column using type III collagen coupled to Sepharose 4 B. The column was equilibrated and washed with PBS. The bound protein was eluted with 4 m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and dialyzed with distilled water (three changes) at 4 °C. The dialyzed pool fraction was concentrated and reconstituted in PBS and redialyzed against the same buffer. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough H.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human blood (nine parts) was collected from normal volunteers after an overnight fast in polypropylene tubes containing 1 part 3.8% sodium citrate. PRP was prepared by centrifuging the citrated blood at room temperature for 10 min at 226 × g (13Chiang T.M. Beachey E.H. Kang A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 250: 6916-6922Google Scholar). Whole blood and PRP were exposed to plastic surfaces or siliconized vessels only. Platelet counts of the PRP ranged from 200,000 to 300,000 per mm3. Platelet aggregation was assayed by the turbidimetric method of Born (14Born G.V. Nature. 1962; 194: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar) using a ChronoLog Lumi aggregometer (ChronoLog Corp., Havertown, PA). An aliquot of 0.45 ml of PRP was pipetted into a small siliconized cuvette and stirred at a constant speed of 1100 rpm at 37 °C. The changes in percent transmission were recorded continuously. Equal volumes of PRP and 20 mm Tris-HCl, 130 mm NaCl, and 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.4 (Tris-NaCl-EDTA) were mixed together and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The pellet formed was washed once with Tris-NaCl-EDTA and then suspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 400,000–600,000 platelets/mm3. An aliquot (20 μl) of [14C]serotonin (specific activity 51.5 mCi/mmol) was added into PRP (20 ml) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. At the end of the incubation, an equal volume of Tris-EDTA was added before centrifugation at 500 ×g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of Tris-EDTA and centrifuged again. The platelets were then resuspended in Tris-EDTA at a concentration of 400,000–600,000 platelets/mm3 (13Chiang T.M. Beachey E.H. Kang A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 250: 6916-6922Google Scholar). Neutral salt soluble collagen (type I and type III) was extracted from human placenta (collected from a local hospital after full-term delivery). The extracted collagens were purified by different salt concentrations as previously described (15Seyer J.M. Mainardi C.M. Kang A.H. Biochemistry. 1980; 9: 1583-1589Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Kang A.H. Piez K.A. Gross J. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3648-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The type I collagen solution was also purchased from ChronoLog Corp. The purified r47 protein (47-kDa recombinant protein) was incubated with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (FLUOS) according to the manufacturer's procedure (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, 0.5 mg of the purified recombinant protein (dissolved in 0.5 ml of PBS) was incubated with 50 μg of (1:10) FLUOS for 2 h with stirring at room temperature (protected from light). The bound FLUOS and unbound FLUOS were separated with a Sephadex column and eluted with PBS. The bound FLUOS-recombinant protein fractions were collected. Aliquots of 100-μl volume containing various amounts of type III collagen (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, or 40 μg) in phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, were added into micro titer wells and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Wells were washed with PBS and incubated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (150 μl/well) for 30 min at room temperature. The wells were washed with PBS again before the addition of FLUOS-labeled recombinant protein. At the end of incubation, the wells were washed three times with PBS. A BioRad Fluoromark was used to detect the bound FLUOS-recombinant protein. An aliquot (1 ml) of r47 protein or control protein was placed on the artificial matrix (human type III) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Following incubation, an aliquot of washed 14C-labeled platelets was added to each Petri dish and incubated for an additional 20 min. The Petri dishes (Nalge Nunc, Denmark) were washed five times (2 ml each) with Tris-EDTA. The attached platelets were detached with 10 ml of ScintiVerse BD (2 ml/time). Radioactivity was assessed with a Packard Scintillation counter (6Chiang T.M. Rinaldy A. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Aortas from rabbits were dissected from the surrounding tissues, the endothelia were denuded with a rubber policeman, and aortas were cut into segments. Aortic segments (0.8 g, wet weight) were incubated with either recombinant protein or control protein for 10 min. At the end of incubation, an aliquot of 14C-labeled platelets was added to each sample, and the preparation was incubated for an additional 20 min. The aortic segments were washed with 12 ml (3 ml each × 4) of Tris-EDTA buffer, and the radioactivity recovered was measured in a scintillation counter in the presence of 10 ml of ScintiVerse BD (7Chiang T.M. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have used Western blot analyses to examine the existence of the 47-kDa protein in mouse tissues and platelets (Fig. 1). Based on the same amount of protein (Lowry determination) used, there are differences in band intensity of the Western blot. The 47-kDa protein exists in all the rat tissues and platelets examined. Purified platelet 47-kDa protein was analyzed with 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Amido Black and destained with water. The corresponding spot was excised and subject to determination of the amino terminus sequence by a sequencer (Applied Biotechnology). The determined sequence is DARKSEV. The strategy for cloning the cDNA (which encodes the 47-kDa protein) was using the polymerase chain reaction with a degenerate oligonucleotide and poly(dT)12·(dG). A 1.2-kb cDNA fragment was obtained, gel purified, subcloned into pBad TOPO prokaryotic expression vector, and sequenced by using custom designed primers (Fig. 2). The open reading frame represented by 1065 bases of this cDNA with the TAA stop codon at position 1063. A segment of base pairs from the untranslated region of the 5′ end was also identified (data not shown). A computer search of the gene bank, however, did not find any significant homology. The calculated molecular mass of the recombinant protein is 42 kDa.Figure 2Nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned cDNA.Double-stranded cDNA sequences were initiated with forward and reverse primers of pBad TOPO vector by chain termination reaction. Other primers (underlined to indicate the direction of the sequence) were made according to the sequenced portion of the cDNA. The underlines of top stranded are forward primers for sequencing. The underlines of the bottom stranded are reverse primers for sequencing. The deduced amino acid sequence was determined with a computer program (Mac Vector). The stop codon (TAA) was located at position 1063. The GenBankTMaccession number is AF521131. Peptide 1 is in bold letters. Peptide 2 is in bold and italicized letters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The recombinant protein from the pBad TOPO-47 cDNA expression vector was expressed in E. coli (Fig.3 A) (compare lane 1to lane 2 for pBad TOPO-47 cDNA and mock-transfected cell extracts, respectively). The crude protein from the cell extract was purified through binding of the hexahistidine tag (located at the amino-terminal end of the protein) to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column. It was further purified by type III collagen affinity column chromatography. The degree of purification of the recombinant protein was examined by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. A single band witha molecular mass of 47 kDa was obtained (Fig.3 B). Several experiments were performed to investigate whether the isolated recombinant protein could specifically bind to type III collagen. In the first set of experiments, the recombinant protein extracts were applied to affinity columns of type I collagen-Sepharose 2B and type III collagen-Sepharose 2B. The recombinant protein bound to type III collagen but not to type I collagen-Sepharose 2B (data not shown). Because the r47 protein cannot be phosphorylated, we have used FLUOS-labeled r47 protein to perform additional experiments. Varying amounts of the FLUOS-labeled recombinant protein were incubated on type III collagen-coated micro titer wells and the amount of fluorescence was measured by a BioRad Fluoromark. As shown in TableI, binding was dependent on the amount of FLUOS-labeled r47 protein added. Binding was inhibited by a 10-fold excess of unlabeled recombinant protein indicating that the binding is specific. At the highest concentration of FLUOS-labeled r47 protein, the FLUOS- labeled r47 protein binds to type I collagen-coated micro titer wells, but the binding of FLUOS-labeled r47 protein could not be replaced by the addition of a 10-fold excess of non-labeled r47 protein. Moreover, binding could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by anti-47-kDa (anti-platelet receptor for type III collagen) (8Chiang T.M. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 443-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but not by anti-65-kDa (anti-platelet receptor for type I collagen) (6Chiang T.M. Rinaldy A. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as shown in Table II. There was no demonstrable binding of the labeled recombinant protein to laminin- and fibronectin-coated micro titer wells (data not shown).Table IBinding of FLUOS-labeled recombinant protein to type I and type III collagens-coated micro titer wellsFLUOS-recombinant protein addedFLUOS-labeled recombinant protein boundType I collagenType III collagenArbitrary unit (mean ± S.D.)0000.5 μg001 μg0258 ± 92 μg0677 ± 2624 μg1825 ± 9331699 ± 1084 μg + non-labeled r47 protein (40 μg)1756 ± 878100 ± 24Micro titer wells were coated with 100 μl of type I or type III collagen (50 μg) in 120 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, at 4 °C overnight.

In previous studies we have shown that the 47-kDa protein was isolated and purified from platelets and could competitively inhibit type III collagen-mediated platelet aggregation (6Chiang T.M. Rinaldy A. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We, therefore, tested the effect of the purified recombinant protein on type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 A shows type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner (curves a, b,c, and d are PBS control, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μg, respectively). Fig. 4 B shows the inhibitory effect of the purified recombinant protein (10, 20, and 40 for curves d,c, and b, respectively) on type III collagen (0.5 μg)-induced platelet aggregation. Both 20 and 40 μg of r47 protein were completely inhibited platelet aggregation (B, curvesb and c). The 10 μg of r47 protein has less inhibition on 0.5 μg of collagen-induced platelet aggregation (B, curve d). We then fixed the r47 protein (20 μg) and varied the amounts of collagen (0.5, 1, and 2 μg forC, curves b, c, and d, respectively). Results showed that the inhibitory effect of the r47 protein can be relieved by higher amounts of collagen. The effect of the purified r47 protein on type III collagen-induced platelet protein phosphorylation was also examined (Fig.5). There are two platelet proteins with a molecular mass of 47 and 22 kDa, respectively, which showed an increase in radiolabeled phosphate incorporation by collagen (0.5 μg) compared with PBS control (lane 2 compared with lane 1). The pre-incubation of collagen (0.5 μg) with various amounts of r47 protein inhibits phosphorylation of both platelet proteins (lanes 3, 4, and 5 for 40, 20, and 10 μg, respectively). We then analyzed the deduced amino acid sequence with a hydrophilicity plot to identify the extracellular domains (data not shown). We have defined four outer surface domains, chemically synthesized four peptides, and tested their ability to inhibit type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation. We have found two peptides that inhibit type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation (Fig.6). One of the active peptides is located at the amino terminus end. In conclusion, we have isolated a cDNA fragment for encoding a platelet protein, which is recognized by a polyclonal antibody raised against the platelet 47-kDa protein. The recombinant protein and its derived synthesized peptides resemble the platelet 47-kDa protein and are able to inhibit type III but not type I collagen-induced platelet aggregation. We have cloned a 1.2-kb cDNA with a functional open reading frame from the human bone marrow cDNA library using the polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA fragment was purified and subcloned into a prokaryotic expression vector (pBad TOPO) and a recombinant protein was expressed and purified to apparent homogeneity as shown on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The calculated (from amino acid composition) molecular mass of this recombinant protein is 45 kDa and it is recognized by anti-47-kDa in Western blots. Type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by the pre-incubation of the recombinant protein with type III collagen in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-incubation of platelets with the recombinant protein did not inhibit type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation. This observed effect suggests that the recombinant protein binds to type III collagen. Data from binding of the radiolabeled r47 protein to collagen-Sepharose 2B columns suggest that the r47 protein binds to type III collagen. This result is consistent with our earlier report that the anti-47-kDa inhibits type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation (8Chiang T.M. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 443-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Binding of FLUOS-labeled r47 protein to type I collagen-coated micro titer wells can only be obtained at a high concentration. The high concentration binding could not be replaced with a 10-fold excess of non-labeled r47 protein. From the comparison of the r47 protein inhibition on type I and type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation and the binding data, we may draw the conclusion that the binding is nonspecific or that the binding site may be different. We have also defined two peptides that inhibit type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 6). The amino acid sequence of those two peptides is different from the existing known sequences of peptide inhibitors suggesting that there is more than one site for platelets to react with collagen (6Chiang T.M. Rinaldy A. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Chiang T.M. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has been reported that platelet receptors for type I and type III collagens are different based on different approaches (1Fitzsimmons C.M. Cawston T.E. Barnes M.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1986; 56: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Staatz W.D. Fok K.F. Zutter M.M. Adams S.P. Rodriguez B.A. Santoro S. J. Biol.

In the present investigation, we have shown that the amino acid residues of active sites are different from the type I receptor site. These results further indicate that there are different reactive sites for type I and type III collagens. Interestingly, the platelet receptor for type III collagen possesses two binding sites compared with one site for the type I collagen (7Chiang T.M. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One of these active peptides is located at the amino terminus of the extracellular domain. The location may be more assessable to bind type III collagen. Determining if this is the reason for type III collagen reacting more efficiently to platelets will require further studies entailing switching the positions of the active site. The platelet receptor for type III collagen is more hydrophobic than the platelet receptor for type I collagen (the 65-kDa protein) (6Chiang T.M. Rinaldy A. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Monnet and Fauvel-Lafeve (5Monnet M. Fauvel-Lafeve F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10912-10917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have described a platelet receptor that binds type III collagen specifically. The protein has a molecular mass of 68–72 kDa and does not correspond to any other already known platelet collagen receptor including the presently described platelet receptor for type III collagen. These results indicate that there are more than one platelet receptors for type III collagen. Taken together, our current data strongly suggest that the recombinant protein encoded by the 1.2-kb-cloned cDNA is a platelet 47-kDa protein. This postulation is based on five supporting findings. First, the polyclonal antibody raised against the platelet-purified 47-kDa protein recognizes the recombinant protein. Second, the purified r47 protein binds to type III collagen-Sepharose 2B column and type III collagen-coated micro titer wells. Third, the purified recombinant protein inhibits type III collagen-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner and can be reversed by adding higher amounts of type III collagen. Fourth, the inhibitory effect of the recombinant protein on platelet aggregation requires the pre-incubation of the recombinant protein with type III collagen. And finally, the binding of the recombinant protein to type III collagen-coated micro titer wells is inhibited by anti-47-kDa but not anti-65-kDa in a dose-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2069709407,"Previous studies have postulated the presence of a heparin-binding site on the bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL), whereas two bile salt-binding sites regulate the enzyme activity. One of these sites may overlap with the tentative heparin-binding site at the level of an N-terminal basic cluster consisting of positive residues Lys32, Lys56, Lys61, Lys62, and Arg63. The present study uses specific site-directed mutagenesis to determine the functional significance of this basic cluster. Mutations in this sequence resulted in recombinant enzymes that were able to bind to immobilized and to cell-associated heparin before moving throughout intestinal cells. Recombinant BSDL was fully active on soluble substrate, but mutants were less active on micellar cholesteryl oleate in comparison with the wild-type enzyme. Activation studies by primary (sodium taurocholate) and by secondary (sodium taurodeoxycholate) bile salts revealed that the activation of BSDL by sodium taurocholate at concentrations below the critical micellar concentration, and not that evoked by micellar bile salts, was affected by substitutions, suggesting that this N-terminal basic cluster likely represents the specific bile salt-binding site of BSDL. Substitutions also affected the activation of the enzyme promoted by anionic phospholipids, extending the function of this site to that of a cationic regulatory site susceptible to accommodate anionic ligands.

Bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL, EC3.1.1.13) 1The abbreviations used are: BSDL, bile salt-dependent lipase (EC; 3.1.1.13), 4-NPC, 4-nitrophenyl hexanoate; NaTC, sodium taurocholate; NaTDC, sodium taurodeoxycholate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Int407, human embryonic intestinal epithelial (cell line); CMC, critical micellar concentration; FCS, fetal calf serum; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is a lipolytic enzyme secreted by the acinar pancreatic cell into the duodenum, where it plays a significant role in dietary lipid digestion. BSDL has been shown to display wide substrate reactivities ranging from the hydrolysis of both long-chain and short-chain fatty acid esters of glycerol, as well as phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and esters of cholesterol and of the fat-soluble vitamin A, E, and D (1Lombardo D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). BSDL, unlike other lipases, is characterized by a unique activation mechanism requiring the binding of bile salts. Early studies have proposed that bile salts interact with two sites on the protein (2Lombardo D. Guy O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 611: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). One site, specific for primary bile salts, is associated with enzyme dimerization and activation, whereas the second is less specific, is able to bind indistinctly primary and secondary bile salts, and is involved in the enzyme binding to micellar or aggregated substrates (3Lombardo D. Campèse D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Campèse D. Lombardo D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). More recently, the presence of these two bile salt-binding sites has been detected on the human milk counterpart enzyme referred to as bile salt-stimulated lipase (5Bläckberg L. Hernell O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These two bile salt-binding sites have been tentatively localized on each BSDL molecule forming the dimeric BSDL-taurocholate complex crystal (6Wang X. Wang C-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X-C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Terzyan S. Wang C-S. Downs D. Hunter B. Zhang X-C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The first one, proximal to the catalytic site, could be identified as the specific binding site (8Moore S.A. Kingston R.L. Loomes K.M. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Baker H.M. Baker E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The second one is located in a depression region on the back side of the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Binding of a monomeric primary bile salt to the specific site leads to the opening of a loop comprised of residues His115 to Tyr125 of the bovine BSDL, a loop that otherwise is in a closed conformation which might hinder substrate binding (6Wang X. Wang C-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X-C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Terzyan S. Wang C-S. Downs D. Hunter B. Zhang X-C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Using chemical modification approaches, tyrosine and arginine have been identified as key residues for BSDL interaction with bile salts (3Lombardo D. Campèse D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Campèse D. Lombardo D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that Arg63 is essential for the enzyme activity on substrates such as cholesteryl oleate solubilized by sodium taurocholate (9Liang Y. Medhekar R. Brockman H.L. Quinn D.M. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24040-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has been shown that BSDL binds to heparin-like molecules lining the intestinal wall and that this binding is reversed by the addition of soluble heparin (10Bosner M.S. Gulick T. Riley D.J.S. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Proc. Soc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7438-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BSDL located on the epithelial cell surface may facilitate the uptake of hydrolyzed dietary lipids and cholesterol (11Fält H. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Arch. Biochem.

However, the association of BSDL with membrane-associated heparin of intestinal cells may be a prerequisite for the uptake of BSDL by these cells and the consecutive transcytotic motion of the enzyme throughout the enterocyte (12Bruneau N. Nganga A. Bendayan M. Lombardo D. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Several groups have proposed that a basic cluster in the N-terminal domain of BSDL may be involved in the binding to heparin (6Wang X. Wang C-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X-C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Moore S.A. Kingston R.L. Loomes K.M. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Baker H.M. Baker E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This N-terminal cluster of positively charged residues forms a cationic protrusion at the surface of the protein (6Wang X. Wang C-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X-C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Moore S.A. Kingston R.L. Loomes K.M. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Baker H.M. Baker E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The side chains of Lys31, Lys56, and Lys58 lie on one side of a groove, whereas those of Lys61, Lys62, and Arg63 lie on the other side (6Wang X. Wang C-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X-C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These latter cationic residues are common to all BSDL (13Sbarra V. Bruneau N. Mas E. Hamosh M. Lombardo D. Hamosh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Another basic cluster consisting of seven positively charged residues (Lys336, Arg423, Lys429, Arg454, Arg458, Lys462, and Lys503) has been localized on the BSDL surface (6Wang X. Wang C-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X-C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This cluster could facilitate the binding of BSDL (possibly dimers) to micelles (6Wang X. Wang C-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X-C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the surface of the BSDL dimer, these residues form two rows of positively charged residues parallel to each other that could also represent another putative heparin-binding site. From those data, it looks possible that heparin-binding and bile salt-binding surfaces may overlap to some degree. The close localization of the sequence Lys-Lys-Arg63, forming the putative heparin site with the disulfide bridge formed by Cys64 and Cys80, leads us to also postulate that this site may be involved in the sensing of the BSDL folding and the secretion of the protein (1Lombardo D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cationic residues of this cluster may not only accommodate the sulfate group of taurine-conjugated bile salts and those of heparin but also the anionic polar head group of phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid that have been shown to regulate neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (14Ishii I. Onozaki R. Takahashi E. Takahashi S. Fujio N. Harada T. Morisaki N. Shirai K. Saito Y. Hirose S. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2303-2310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study is to use a site-directed specific mutagenesis approach to determine the functional significance of the N-terminal basic cluster of BSDL. Unless otherwise stated, all A grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Culture medium Ham's F12 was from Invitrogen. Taq polymerase was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and was a part of the GC-rich PCR kit. Polyclonal antibodies (pAbL10) against a peptide sequence (Val590 to Gln605) of the rat BSDL were raised in rabbit and purified on protein A-Sepharose. These antibodies only recognized rat pancreatic BSDL. Transfected CHO-K1 cells were routinely cultured in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% (by volume) fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells, in 100-mm diameter culture dishes, were maintained under 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Int407 cells, a human embryonic intestinal epithelial cell line (ECACC (European Cell Culture Collection) number 85051004), which exhibit typical epithelial morphology and growth, were cultured as a monolayer for 5 days (12Bruneau N. Nganga A. Bendayan M. Lombardo D. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were kept at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1% (v/v) fungizone, 1% (v/v) essential amino acids, and 10% (v/v) FCS. For individual experiments, cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well on 24-mm polycarbonate permeable supports (Transwell filter inserts with 0.4-μm pore sizes, Corning Costar). The pECE-1 transcript, initially containing wild-type cDNA encoding rat BSDL (15Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), was subcloned in Escherichia coli cells and mutagenized. For this purpose, oligonucleotide primers designed to cover the sequence encoding each residue to be mutagenized were used in PCR reactions in combination with the overlap extension method (16Ansaldi M. Lepelletier M. Méjean V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 110-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The sequence of primers allows the mutagenesis of the sequence Lys-Lys-Arg63 into Ile-Ile-Ala63, that of Lys32 and Lys56 into Ile32 and Ile56, respectively, and can be released upon request. The oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the cDNA sequence of BSDL in pECE-1 vector, were extended using the Advantage GC-rich PCR kit from CLONTECH. The amount of the initial substrate was maintained below 100 ng. Independently of the pair of primers used, the amplification was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 2400 GeneAmp PCR system using a prerun cycle (94 °C, 100 s), and 12 reaction cycles were programmed as follows: denaturation (94 °C, 20 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s), and extension (68 °C, 4 min). The reaction was terminated by an incubation at 68 °C for 4 min. A treatment withDpnI endonuclease was used to eliminate the methylated parental DNA template. About 10 μl of the digested material were used to transform competent Escherichia coli cells (Top10 F′ strain), which were spread on agar plates containing ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Colonies were picked up and cultured in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were pelleted and plasmid cDNA isolated using a miniprep kit method (NucleoSpin Plus, Macherey-Nagel). The first mutagenized plasmid, including the sequence Ile-Ile-Ala63, was then used to mutagenize Lys32 into Ile32. This latter plasmid was finally used as template to substitute Lys56 by Ile56. In short, two plasmids were obtained, the first one bearing mutations on the sequence Lys-Lys-Arg63 representing the putative heparin-binding site and the second one including mutation of the latter sequence and that of Lys32 and Lys56 (representing the basic N-terminal cluster of BSDL). These two plasmids were referred to as 3M (for three mutations, K61I/K62I/R63A) and 5M (for five mutations, K32I/K56I/K61I/K62I/R63A), respectively. Plasmids were completely sequenced using specific primers for BSDL sequence (13Sbarra V. Bruneau N. Mas E. Hamosh M. Lombardo D. Hamosh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to detect any misincorporation of bases by the polymerase within the BSDL cDNA. Mutagenized cDNA of BSDL was then digested using EcoRI restriction enzyme and ligated into pECE-1 vector from which the wild-type cDNA encoding BSDL has been excised previously following the same restriction procedure. This eliminates undesired substitution in the vector. Plasmids pECE-1-3M and pECE-1-5M, bearing the desired mutation, were amplified and sequenced as above, and plasmids with the right orientation were transfected into CHO-K1 cells. pECE-1-3M and pECE-1-5M plasmids encoding mutagenized BSDL were independently co-transfected with pMAM-neo vector (ratio of pMAM-neo/pECE-1, 1/25), an expression vector that carries the resistance to Geneticin (G418). This material was transfected into CHO-K1 cell line using LipofectAMINE according to manufacturer's procedure (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were stabilized in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with G418 (1 mg/ml). The different clones were then isolated by the end-dilution procedure and maintained under G418 selection for at least 3 weeks. Control cells were transfected, according to the same protocol, with the empty pMAM-neo vector, and corresponding positive clones (CHO-control) were selected as above indicated. The CHO-K1 cell line expressing the wild-type BSDL referred to as clone 3B has been already described (17Bruneau N. Nganga A. Fisher E.A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27353-27361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transfected CHO cells were grown to about 80% confluence, and they were then washed twice with incomplete PBS buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 with 0.15 m NaCl and without Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions) and scraped with a rubber policeman. Cells obtained from a 100-mm diameter dish culture were sedimented and homogenized in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (5 mm Mes, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 0.5% Nonidet P40, pH 6.0) by sonication (15 s, 4 watts, 4 °C). Homogenates were quickly cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were immediately used for enzymatic assays. Recombinant BSDL variants were produced by transfected CHO-K1 cells cultured in Ham's F12 medium (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for 16 h in the absence of FCS. Cell culture media were then used as recombinant enzyme source. The esterolytic activity of BSDL was recorded using 4-nitrophenyl hexanoate (4-NPC) as substrate (18Gjellesvik D.R. Lombardo D. Walther B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) in the absence or in the presence of sodium taurocholate (NaTC, 4 mm). When required, sodium taurodeoxycholate (NaTDC) or phospholipids (see below) were added in the cuvette. The concentration of 4-NPC in each assay cuvette was determined after the complete hydrolysis of the substrate provoked by adding 100 μl of 5 N NaOH and using a molar absorption coefficient of 5150 m−1 cm−1 at the isosbestic point (348 nm) of 4-nitrophenol and its anion (19Lombardo D. Guy O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 657: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The critical micellar concentration (CMC) of bile salts in the assay condition of BSDL was recorded by the absorbance of rhodamine 6G (30 μm) at 540 nm (3Lombardo D. Campèse D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cholesterol esterase activity of BSDL was determined on cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Briefly, to a mixture made with 125 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (100 mm, pH 7.5) with or without 14.5 mm sodium taurocholate, 100 μl of recombinant enzyme and 25 μl of water were added to 10 μl of an ethanolic solution of cholesteryl [14C]oleate. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C under agitation, the reaction was stopped with 0.83 ml of Dole mixture (20Vérine A. Salers P. Boyer J. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: E175-E181PubMed Google Scholar) containing 100 μm non-radiolabeled oleic acid used as vector. The released [14C]oleic acid was extracted from the medium by a liquid-liquid system partition as described (20Vérine A. Salers P. Boyer J. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: E175-E181PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was estimated by counting (PCS mixture, AmershamBiosciences) with an LKB scintillation counter. Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid test from Pierce using BSA as standard. A stock solution of phospholipids in chloroform was evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in 20 mm, pH 7.4, Tris-HCl buffer. Suspension was obtained by sonication of lipid (1 min, 10 watts). The phospholipid suspension was then diluted in the BSDL assay to the required final concentration. SDS-PAGE was performed in 7.5% polyacrylamide and 0.1% SDS as described by Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II apparatus. After electrophoretic migration, proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes at 4 mA/cm2 for 18 h. The efficiency of the electrotransfer was checked by staining the nitrocellulose membrane with 2% Ponceau S solution. Nitrocellulose membranes were air-dried, and transferred proteins were detected by immunodetection using polyclonal antibodies pAbL10 (1 μg/ml) specific for the rat pancreatic BSDL. Membranes were developed for 10 min with a mixture of nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate (0.5 mm each) in 0.1m Tris/HCl buffer (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 and then analyzed by densitometric scanning and quantified using the Image program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) Total RNAs were extracted from transfected CHO cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). After migration on 1% agarose gel, RNAs (about 20 μg) were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (22Vérine A. Bruneau N. Valette A., Le Petit-Thévenin J. Pasqualini E. Lombardo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 179-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA probes specific for pancreatic BSDL (500 bp) and for β-actin (300 bp) were obtained and used as described previously (13Sbarra V. Bruneau N. Mas E. Hamosh M. Lombardo D. Hamosh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Probes were radiolabeled by using [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Conditions used for dot-blot dilution and quantification have been already described (22Vérine A. Bruneau N. Valette A., Le Petit-Thévenin J. Pasqualini E. Lombardo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 179-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin-Sepharose (Sigma) column (3-ml wet gel) was equilibrated in a Tris-HCl buffer (10 mm, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, loading buffer). Wild-type or recombinant mutants of BSDL expressed during 16 h in the conditioned medium (without FCS) of transfected CHO-K1 cells were concentrated by centrifugation on Amicon filters (Bedford, MA) up to 3.8–4.0 ml. This medium containing 0.3–0.4 BSDL units as determined on 4-NPC was loaded onto the heparin-Sepharose column and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C under rotation. Unbound material was then eluted (1 ml/min) with the loading buffer, and bound material was further eluted with a linear NaCl concentration gradient from 50 to 500 mm in 10 mm, pH 7.0, Tris-HCl buffer. Two washings were then performed successively with 1 and 2.5 m NaCl in the Tris-HCl buffer. The elution profile was monitored by recording BSDL activity on 4-NPC. The expression of BSDL bearing the mutagenized putative heparin-binding site K61I, K62I, and R63A and that bearing mutation of the basic N-terminal cluster K32I, K56I, K61I, K62I, and R63A was examined in all clones selected for G418 resistance (i.e. six clones with three mutations and three clones with five mutations) and compared with that of the wild-type 3B clone (17Bruneau N. Nganga A. Fisher E.A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27353-27361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and with that of the control clone (i.e. transfected with the pMAM-neo plasmid only). For this purpose, all positive clones were cultured to subconfluence, their respective conditioned media were withdrawn for further analyses, and cells were washed with PBS, harvested, and lysed. Alternatively, before lysis, cells expressing recombinant BSDL were washed with PBS containing 0.25 m NaCl (a salt concentration that should liberate BSDL associated with heparanoids of the outer CHO cell surface, see below). Under these conditions, the amount of BSDL released from membranes never exceeded 5% of that found in the cell lysate (as assessed from the enzyme activity). The cell lysates were cleared and analyzed on SDS-PAGE and with Western blotting. Their activity on 4-NPC in the presence of 4 mmNaTC was also recorded. As shown in Fig.1, all selected clones (excepted control clones) expressed BSDL albeit at various levels. The expression level of BSDL protein correlated with the activity on 4-NPC recorded in each lysate. When the BSDL activity monitored in each lysate was reported to the corresponding amount of protein determined from Western blotting quantification, similar ratios were obtained (230 ± 56, 222 ± 58 and 180 ± 50 for the wild-type enzyme (clone 3B), K61I/K62I/R63A mutants (clones 3M1-3M7), and K32I/K56I/K61I/K62I/R63A mutants (clones 5M1-5M5), respectively). This means that substitutions do not affect significantly the enzyme activity on 4-NPC. The esterolytic activity recorded in control clone lysates (clones C1-C3) could be due to endogenous esterases (23Vérine A., Le Petit-Thévenin J. Panicot-Dubois L. Valette A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12356-12361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The presence of BSDL was also examined in the conditioned medium of selected clones. Western blotting (Fig. 2) showed that BSDL is present in all culture media except those of control clones. Once again, the activity on 4-NPC recorded in these culture media paralleled the amount of BSDL as quantified by Western blotting.Figure 2Secretion of mutagenized BSDL by transfected CHO-K1 cells. Clones obtained as in Fig. 1 were allowed to stand in the culture medium without FCS for 16 h. At the end, the cell-conditioned medium of each clone was analyzed for BSDL by Western blotting using pAbL10 (A, 25 μl cell conditioned medium/lane) followed by quantification (B) and by recording the BSDL activity on 4-NPC in the presence of 4 mm NaTC (C). Values are means ± S.D. of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These data indicated that, independently of the number of mutagenized residues of the N-terminal basic cluster, BSDL is normally expressed and secreted by transfected CHO cells. The amount of BSDL secreted by each clone corroborates the amount of enzyme that is expressed by the clone in question. Overall, in the presence of 4 mm NaTC, K61I/K62I/R63A and K32I/K56I/K61I/K62I/R63A mutagenized BSDL had comparable activity on synthetic water-soluble ester substrate such as 4-NPC than the wild-type enzyme. From this point and besides clone 3B expressing the wild-type BSDL, two clones expressing K61I/K62I/R63A and K32I/K56I/K61I/K62I/R63A mutagenized BSDL (i.e. clones 3M2 and clone 5M5, respectively) expressing an amount of enzyme comparable with that of clone 3B were selected and further analyzed. Dot-blot and Northern blot analyses were used to assess the mRNA abundance and size in selected clones (Fig. 3). Dot-blot quantification indicated that the BSDL mRNA was in similar amounts in stably transfected CHO cell clones expressing wild-type (clone 3B), K61I/K62I/R63A (clone 3M2), and K32I/K56I/K61I/K62I/R63A BSDL (clone 5M5), whereas no mRNA can be detected in control clone C1. The mRNA (2.0 kb) encoding BSDL detected in clone 3B expressing the wild-type enzyme and that detected in clone 3M2 and 5M5 expressing K61I/K62I/R63A and K32I/K56I/K61I/K62I/R63A mutagenized variants of BSDL, respectively, was of the expected size (15Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Also, the cDNA probe for β-actin hybridized with a transcript of the right size (13Sbarra V. Bruneau N. Mas E. Hamosh M. Lombardo D. Hamosh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), present in all selected clones. The amount of mRNA encoding BSDL, equivalent in all selected clones, correlated quite well with the amount of BSDL expressed by the corresponding clone. Furthermore, and except for the control clone C1 that does not secrete BSDL, the three selected clones expressing wild-type, K61I/K62I/R63A, and K32I/K56I/K61I/K62I/R63A BSDL (i.e. 3B, 3M2 and 5M5 clones) secreted the enzyme at the same rate (19.4 ± 2.1 10−3 units/mg of cell proteins/h). Wild-type BSDL (clone 3B), K61I/K62I/R63A (clone 3M2), and K32I/K56I/K61I/K62I/R63A (clone 5M5) mutagenized recombinant variants of BSDL were characterized based on heparin binding. Heparin-Sepharose chromatography was used to measure the relative affinities of mutants for heparin, and the position of the peak in the heparin-Sepharose chromatogram reflects the affinity of protein for immobilized heparin. Therefore the position of the peak is expected to shift to a lower salt concentration upon mutation of any residue that forms a heparin-binding site in the wild-type enzyme. Accordingly, the same amount of recombinant BSDL was chromatographed on a heparin-Sepharose column, and after elution of unbound material, bound enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient in NaCl. The results showed that mutations of either the putative heparin-binding sequence Lys-Lys-Arg63 or of this sequence associated with the substitutions of Lys32 and Lys56 did not affect the binding of BSDL to Sepharose-immobilized heparin. Wild-type and mutagenized variants of BSDL were eluted at a similar volume of the NaCl gradient (Fig. 4). Such results strongly suggest that amino acids of the N-terminal cationic cluster of BSDL, i.e. Lys-Lys-Arg63, Lys32, and Lys56 likely do not participate in binding to immobilized heparin. Heparin-like molecules lining intestinal microvilosities have been implicated in the binding of BSDL to the intestinal wall (10Bosner M.S. Gulick T. Riley D.J.S. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Proc. Soc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988"
