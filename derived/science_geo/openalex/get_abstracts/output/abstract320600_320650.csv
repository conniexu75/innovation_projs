During this time, human adaptations underwent a series of crucial transformations involving profound changes in cultural systems and perthaps also in aspects of the biological basis for culture."

He was on his way to England in the service of the Canadian government. Canada has lost a great citizen, the University and the medical profession one of their most distinguished scientists, and humanity a practical benefactor without equal in this generation."
https://openalex.org/W2061216848,"Chemical and pharmacological tests have been carried out on a sample of ""low nicotine"" tobacco. Laboratory tests involving toxicological studies on mice and blood pressure determinations in the dog showed that the toxic and vasopressor effects of the smoke from this tobacco was proportional to the amount of nicotine present and relatively independent of the nornicotine content of the tobacco. On man the smoke from these low nicotine cigarettes produced very much less pronounced effects on blood pressure and pulse rate than that produced by ordinary cigarettes. These results indicate that this type of tobacco is sufficiently low in nicotine to make it practically deserving of much further study."

Under the auspices of this committee, a meeting of the state and municipal registrars in the Eastern states was held at the Hygiene Laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, November 29 and 30. At this initial conference there were present also several private statisticians interested in the public health statistics of the epidemic and the results to be derived from study of such data. A series of suggestions was made up, mimeographed and sent to statistical and public health workers for criticism. At the, meeting of the Vital Statistics Section in Chicago, December 11, the committee submitted a report on its activities and asked for authority to continue further inquiry into a program of statistical study of the epidemic. The section authorized the continuance of"
