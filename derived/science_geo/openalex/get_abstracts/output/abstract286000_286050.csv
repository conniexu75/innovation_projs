https://openalex.org/W2004818859,"A high-frequency radar remote-sensing system for measuring and mapping near-surface ocean currents in coastal waters has been analyzed and described. A transportable prototype version of the system was designed, constructed, and tested. With two units operating tens of kilometers apart, the currents were mapped in near real time at a grid of points 3 by 3 km covering areas exceeding 2000 kM(2), out to a distance of about 70 km from the shore. Preliminary estimates of the precision of current velocity measurements show it to be better than 30 cm/sec."
https://openalex.org/W2116776672,"Twenty-nine radiocarbon-dated pack rat middens document woodland communities in the deserts of the southwestern United States less than 10,000 years ago. A synchronous change from woodland to desert or grassland occurred about 8000 years ago in the Chihuahuan, Sonoran, and Mohave deserts. A shift of the Aleutian low and the winter storm track to the north, which resulted in drastically reduced winter precipitation in these areas, is inferred. The shift to nonpluvial climates in the Southwest lagged behind the beginning of nonglacial climates in the North because the melting continental glaciers contined to affect general circulation patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2071646278,"The International Sun-Earth Explorer is a three-spacecraft program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the European Space Agency aimed at securing a more quantitative knowledge of the structure and stability of the magnetosphere. One spacecraft (ISEE-C) makes observations in the solar wind upstream of the earth, while the other two (ISEE-A and ISEE-B), in the same highly eccentric orbit but separated by a relatively small variable distance, observe inside the magnetosphere. This international program is concurrent with the International Magnetospheric Study, to which ISEE-A and ISEE-C form a large U.S. contribution. The scientific aims and technological methods are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1991607270,"Rubidium-potassium ratios were determined on foliage, litter, and surface soils of plots in two plantations of Pinus resinosa 41 to 46 years old previously fertilized once with potassium. Calculations based on indigenous soil rubidium as the ""tagging"" ion demonstrate that after 9 years some 60 percent of the foliage potassium is still derived from the fertilizer, and after 23 years about 40 percent of the foliage potassium is derived from the fertilizer. Additional fertilizer potassium is present in soil and litter, indicating the high retention of this mobile element in the pine ecosystem."

https://openalex.org/W1996288795,"A survey was conducted in the northwestern Sargasso Sea during the spring to assess the effect and extent of the winter cooling of 1976 to 1977 on the ocean. Newly formed, well-mixed layers of 18 degrees C water as deep as 550 meters were observed. The main thermocline south of the Gulf Stream was 100 to 150 meters deeper than it is on the average, which implies significant changes in the baroclinic transports."

https://openalex.org/W1530811287,"Growth was obtained in rats on synthetic diets in which the ten essential amino acids were the sole source of amino acid nitrogen. The growth rate was dependent upon the quantity of amino acids fed and appeared to compare favorably with that obtained when a similar quantity of nitrogen was fed in the form of casein. No increase in growth was observed when nitrogen in addition to that given in the form of the essential amino acids was supplied as glycine. Our experiments would not support the contention that the unnatural forms of the amino acids are toxic. We wish to acknowledge and thank Phyllis Robison for technical assistance, and Dr. D. Mark Hegsted for helpful suggestions."

https://openalex.org/W1992572175,"There is an almost bewildering variety of detectors being used for ground-based astronomical observations. Many of the detectors have advantages for particular projects. One-dimensional detectors are simple, yet suitable for spectroscopy. Other detectors offer high photometric precision and dimensional stability. Some are designed for observing only faint objects and some for bright ones. Sometimes the necessity of having a high quantum efficiency at a particular wavelength dictates the choice of detector. In reality the situation is even more chaotic. This review has not covered some of the exotic detectors that have been developed for x-ray and far-ultraviolet imaging from spacecraft. These detectors use devices such as resistive plates, multianode or crossed-wire microchannel plates, and so on. These devices have not yet seen extensive use in ground-based applications, and their future as visible light detectors remains uncertain. The reasons for the development of such a wide variety of detectors are clear. Commercially available devices are simply not capable of meeting the low light level and photometric performance capabilities needed for astronomical observations. The driving forces are the commercial and military applications for detectors, and with few exceptions there has not been sufficient funding available to mount a detector development program for astronomy. Therefore, astronomers have sought to adapt existing commercial devices to the particular problem at hand. The large number of individual efforts summarized in this review is the result. In the future, I expect the variety to diminish as one or two really good detectors become capable of performing well under the wide variety of observational conditions encountered in astronomy. Many people have proclaimed the ultimate detector to be just around the corner. This is yet to happen. However, I venture to speculate that low-noise, high-performance CCD detectors with a format of 500 by 500 or larger will emerge as the preferred astronomical detector within the next few years. I also expect photographic plates will continue to be used for the many applications requiring wide fields up to 10,000 pixels on a side. Finally, as the detectors approach the ultimate quantum limit, attention will shift away from them and toward development of the system necessary to manipulate, display, and extract the information from the 250,000 numbers that make up a 500 by 500 digital image."
https://openalex.org/W2062288763,"Minerals of the Broken Hill lode in New South Wales, Australia, have a rich assemblage of fluid inclusions. Most typically they contain a high-salinity aqueous liquid and a high-density carbon dioxide and methane gas. Northerly trending shear zones in the area are characterized by a distinct assemblage of inclusions. The inclusions provide a record of the sequence of metamorphic fluids since the period of high-grade metamorphism. Inclusions from the period of ore formation have been eliminated by repeated deformation and recrystallization."
